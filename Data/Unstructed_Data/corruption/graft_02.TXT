* * * * * * * * * * DESCRIPTION * * * * * * * * * *

   Kips Bay Medical, Inc.. Kips Bay Medical, Inc. is a medical device company
focused on developing, manufacturing and commercializing its external saphenous
vein support technology (eSVS MESH) for use in coronary artery bypass grafting
(CABG) surgery. The Company's eSVS MESH is a nitinol mesh sleeve that, when
placed over a saphenous vein graft during CABG surgery, is designed to improve
the structural characteristics and performance of the vein graft. The eSVS MESH
is a kink-resistant extravascular tubular prosthesis made of knitted
nickel/titanium, or nitinol, wire mesh. The eSVS Mesh is designed to be fitted
like a sleeve on the outside of saphenous vein grafts to strengthen SVGs used in
coronary artery bypass graft surgery. It is designed to provide the vein graft
with physiological attributes similar to those of an artery by strengthening the
vessel wall, reducing the lumen diameter and improving blood flow
characteristics.

Hoke fire chief to have skin-graft surgery on arms; Go Fund Me page set up

BYLINE: Nancy McCleary, The Fayetteville Observer, N.C.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 338 words


March 21--A Hoke County fire chief who was seriously burned while battling a
woods fire will undergo a skin graft procedure Tuesday as he continues to
recover from his injuries.

Michael Scott, chief of the Hillcrest Fire Department, is being treated at the
N.C. Jaycee Burn Center in Chapel Hill for burns on his arms and face.

Scott was hurt Friday when an outdoors fire on Lawrence McCollum Road spread to
an aluminum storage shed filled with equipment and flammable liquids, said Maj.
Freddy Johnson Sr. of the Hoke County Sheriff's Office.

Scott was standing near the door of the shed when another firefighter went in,
setting off an explosion from the built-up gas vapors, Johnson said.

Scott's hair, eyebrows, whiskers and eyelashes were singed and he had second-
and third-degree burns on his arms.

Doctors will clean his wounds and graft "pigskin" onto his forearms, Scott's
wife, Michelle Scott, said today.

She also is a firefighter with the Hillcrest Fire Department and was working the
fire when her husband was burned.

"He's holding up," she said of her husband. "Just keep him in your prayers."

Marc Sykes, a Hillcrest firefighter, created a Go Fund Me page for the Scott
family, which includes two children.

"The fire department is his life," Sykes wrote of Scott, "however he works a
full-time job in an effort to provide a stable life for his family.

"During this time, unfortunately, he will be unable to perform basic tasks and
will not be able to provide for his family."

The goal is to raise $25,000.

"No amount is too small, no amount will go unnoticed. Medical bills, loss of
income, and unforeseen debts will continue to come months after the wounds begin
to heal."

The effort had brought in $1,490 as of this afternoon.

St. Jude gets 510(k) approval for 1st sutureless CABG device

LENGTH: 980 words

St. Jude gets 510(k) approval for 1st sutureless CABG device

By HOLLAND JOHNSON Medical Device Daily Staff Writer For years, patients have
had to rely on the sewing skills of a doctor when undergoing coronary bypass
operations. For over three decades, surgeons have used a needle and thread to
stitch new blood vessels into patients during coronary artery bypass grafting
surgery (CABG). A new device may make good old-fashioned knitting skills a thing
of the past, and patients won't have to worry about becoming a possible human
pincushion.

St. Jude Medical (St. Paul, Minnesota) has received  510(k) clearance from the
FDA to commercially market the Symmetry Bypass System Aortic Connector. The
Aortic Connector is the first in what the company hopes is a full line of
sutureless anastomosis devices for CABG surgical procedures. The company said it
is developing mechanical connectors and delivery systems to address what it
thinks is a potential $1 billion-plus CABG market.

The product has been CE-marked since May 2000 in a controlled market release in
55 centers with more than 1,000 implants. The Aortic Connector was developed by
St. Jude's Cardiac Surgery Division-Anastomotic Technology Group, formally
Vascular Science (VSI; also Minneapolis). St. Jude completed the acquisition of
VSI in September 1999, and this FDA approval triggered a $5 million milestone
payment to the former shareholders of Vascular Science.

More than 750,000 coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) procedures are performed
annually worldwide, requiring multiple connections (anastomoses) between the
vein grafts and the aorta (proximal connection) and coronary arteries (distal
connection) of the heart. In CABG surgery, the anastomosis, or the suturing of
the graft to the aorta and the coronary artery, is usually the most difficult,
time consuming and critical part of the bypass procedure. This new device will
allow cardiac surgeons to attach vein grafts to the aorta without sutures. St.
Jude feels that creating blood vessel anastomoses quickly, reproducibly and
without the use of suture material carries the potential of a safer, faster,
easier bypass operation for the patient.

"Our new anastomotic connectors provide an important growth vehicle for our
division and St. Jude Medical," said Steven Healy, president of St. Jude
Medical's Cardiac Surgery Division. "Since the vast majority of cardiac surgery
cases are CABG procedures, these connector products represent a substantial
opportunity to expand our business and build on the excellent relationships that
our Heart Valve Group has developed with surgeons over the last 25 years."

During the procedure, a device loaded with a vein is inserted into a small hole
that the surgeon cuts in a patient's aorta. The surgeon then pushes a button on
the device and this releases a tiny web of wires that unfolds to form a
star-shaped rivet. The vein is attached to the aorta in less than 10 seconds.

A primary benefit of this device is that, unlike the standard procedure, no
cross clamping of the aorta will be necessary. "When cross clamping is done,
either side butting or total cross clamping whether it's an on pump or off pump
procedure, that is one of the contributing factors to post-operative stroke,"
Healy told Medical Device Daily. "We think we'll have some real clinical
benefits in terms of reducing post-operative cognitive loss or post-operative
stroke."

Despite the advantages to this new device, there will probably be some surgeons
who may be hesitant to use it. This is a field in which doctors take a great
deal of pride in their "good hands." However, with the ever-present threat of
post-operative neurological problems, these same surgeons may take a closer look
at what this technology has to offer.

"If you have a patient with a brain problem after an [otherwise] uncomplicated
operation, that can be disastrous," said Thierry Carrel, MD, a Swiss surgeon
involved in the European trials of the device.

Another factor that will definitely come into play with this device is price.
"We're looking at a list price in the U.S. of $450 per connector," said Healy.
This is substantially more than the cost of sutures, and insurance companies
generally only will pay doctors and hospitals a fixed amount for bypass
procedures. Once the full line of connectors becomes available, the total added
cost for performing this procedure could total more than $2,000. "That's why
there has got to be compelling clinical benefit to use [the device]," Healy
added. The company also said that shorter operating times and other savings
should offset much of the additional cost.

Many doctors who like the product think it won't gain widespread acceptance
until a distal connector is available. Currently with the device, surgeons must
still stitch the other end of the vein to an artery on the heart below the
obstruction.

The company already is working on the second product in the new line, called the
Coronary Connector, to address this problem. It was first implanted in November
2000 and is currently in clinical evaluation outside the U.S. This technology
connects the saphenous vein to the coronary artery, creating what the company
termed a "high-quality, rapid and reproducible anastomosis." Clinical experience
with this product was reported in The Lancet in March, and the company hopes to
have U.S. approval for the device by mid-2002.

Daniel Sullivan, president of St. Jude's Anastomotic Technology Group, said,
"The Aortic Connector enables a cardiac surgeon to perform quick, reproducible
aortic anastomoses. Over 1,000 connectors have been implanted to date, with very
positive physician feedback. We believe the evolution of this technology may
ultimately reduce the need for cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic manipulation,
facilitating off-pump procedures."

Product Briefs

· CardioTech International (Woburn, Massachusetts) said it entered Phase II
trials for its CardioPass coronary artery bypass graft following the mid-October
implantation of the graft during a triple bypass procedure on a 76-year-old
woman at the Institute for Cardiology (Porto Alegre, Brazil). Michael Szycher,
chief executive officer, said, "With this third implantation, we are freezing
the 'Nesralla' protocol and entering Phase II." Phase II trials will involve an
additional 10 clinical centers in Brazil and Chile. CardioTech's vascular grafts
are made of ChronoFlex, a family of polyurethanes the company said has been
demonstrated to be biodurable and biocompatible.

· Cytyc (Boxborough, Massachusetts) said more than 40 studies involving its
ThinPrep Pap Test and ThinPrep Imaging System were presented this week during
the 51st annual scientific meeting of the American Society of Cytopathology in
Orlando, Florida. Two studies concluded that the ThinPrep Imaging System
"greatly increases cytotechnologist screening productivity while at least
maintaining, and sometimes improving, sensitivity/specificity at all diagnostic
levels" and that the system "has the potential to further reduce screening
errors as compared to a manual review method" for screening slides. Other
studies reported on a range of subjects relating to the ThinPrep System,
including increased sensitivity for the detection of high-grade lesions with the
ThinPrep Pap Test and adjunctive testing for human papillomavirus directly from
the ThinPrep Pap Test vial. Seven studies focused on the ThinPrep System for
non-gynecological applications.

· Guidant (Indianapolis, Indiana) reported FDA approval of the Endotak Reliance
G family of defibrillation leads. The product line features a proprietary
covering to prevent tissue in-growth into the defibrillation coils without
compromising the electrical performance of the lead. The Endotak Reliance G
leads feature a covering from W.L. Gore & Associates (Flagstaff, Arizona)
through an exclusive agreement between the companies. Guidant said it is the
first defibrillation lead on the market to address tissue in-growth using this
approach. Dr. Larry Rosenthal, investigator in the Endotak Reliance G clinical
study at the University of Massachusetts Memorial Medical Center (Worcester,
Massachusetts), said, "Lead removal is made even more difficult when tissue
attaches to the lead. Guidant is the first company to offer a lead with covered
coils that prevent tissue in-growth."

· Illumina (San Diego, California) said it is beta testing the BeadStation 500G
for performing medium-scale genotyping using its field-proven single-nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) genotyping technology. The system is designed to match the
throughput requirements and variable automation needs of individual research
groups and core labs. The BeadStation 500G will initially support a new
high-density version of the company's Sentrix 16HD BeadChip, which allows
simultaneous processing of 16 samples, interrogating up to 1536 SNP loci per
sample. The BeadStation 500G includes Illumina's BeadArray Reader, required for
imaging the high-density BeadChips, genotyping analysis software that provides
automated genotype scoring, GoldenGate assay reagents to perform highly
multiplexed genotyping reactions, and training and support.

· Orthovita (Malvern, Pennsylvania) said it has received an investigational
device exemption from the FDA allowing the company to begin a pivotal human
clinical study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Cortoss Synthetic
Cortical Bone Void Filler in the repair of vertebral compression fractures
(VCF).  Using the vertebroplasty technique, the study will assess the ability of
Cortoss to provide both pain relief and improvement in function to VCF patients
by providing strength and stability to fractured vertebra. Low volumes of
Cortoss will be injected percutaneously through the skin into the fractured
thoracic or lumbar vertebra to stabilize and restore load-bearing capability.
FDA approval of the pivotal study marks the beginning of the final step in a
four-step process to attain marketing approval for Cortoss in VCF, Orthovita
said. Cortoss is a high-strength, biocompatible, self-setting composite
engineered to mimic the characteristics of the body's weight-bearing structural
bone. It is administered using a prefilled, unit dose disposable cartridge.

· Synthetic Blood International (Costa Mesa, California) reported the successful
completion of the first of three dose levels in a Phase I dosage study of
Oxycyte, its perfluorocarbon-based (PFC) blood substitute. Nine subjects were
given intravenous infusions of either Oxycyte or a control fluid and then
evaluated extensively for adverse effects. Only one reaction, a minor, transient
fever was seen in one subject. The purpose of the study is to confirm the safety
of Oxycyte in humans so that it can be tested in Phase II studies. The study is
an escalating dose design. A total of three dose levels, each higher than the
preceding one, will be tested. Subjects will be followed for 28 days after
dosing and the study is expected be completed by year-end.

· Viatronix (Stony Brook, New York), a developer of 2-D/3-D visualization
software, has received FDA 510(k) clearance for its V3D-Vascular module. The
V3D-Vascular module allows radiologists to examine vessels in 2-D and 3-D, fly
through, view hard and soft plaque and make precise measurements. The
V3D-Vascular module streamlines vascular computed tomography, magnetic resonance
and 3-D reconstructed X-ray angiography examinations with a variety of tools to
select and visualize entire vascular trees in seconds. The company said the
technology in V3D Vascular is able to distinguish and segment poorly enhanced
and small vessels throughout the body. Many vessels can be selected with just a
single mouse click. V3D-Vascular also contains techniques to visually eliminate
calcified plaque from 3-D views, leaving the remaining blood lumen clearly
visible.

Political Memo;
The Whiff of Corruption Persists in Connecticut

BYLINE:   By MARC SANTORA

SECTION: Section 1; Column 5; Metropolitan Desk; Pg. 44

LENGTH: 1114 words

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Sept. 20


"Everybody is talkin' these days about Tammany men growin' rich on graft," said
George Washington Plunkitt, a onetime leader of New York's infamous Tammany
Hall, "but nobody thinks of drawin' the distinction between honest graft and
dishonest graft."

While no one is comparing the depth of corruption found recently in the
administration of Connecticut's governor, John G. Rowland, to that of the
turn-of-the-century political machine in New York City, a federal investigation
has netted enough plea deals to raise more than a few eyebrows throughout the
state.

Last week, Connecticut's commissioner of public works, Theodore Anson, resigned
after admitting that he had taken a gift from an architectural firm with
multimillion-dollar contracts with the state. Through his lawyer, Mr. Anson
contended that there was nothing improper about accepting the gift -- designs
for a $190,000 addition to his home that architecture experts said were worth as
much as $20,000. He is the highest-ranking member of the administration to be
caught up in the controversy over the awarding of state contracts, and his
departure has ignited yet another round of speculation about whether more
resignations -- or indictments -- can be expected.

Four years ago, Paul J. Silvester, the state treasurer appointed by Governor
Rowland, pleaded guilty to racketeering and money laundering, opening a series
of federal and state investigations into possible corruption in the state
capital.

Since then, Governor Rowland's deputy chief of staff, Lawrence E. Alibozek, was
indicted by federal prosecutors and pleaded guilty to bribery charges for
accepting cash and gold coins in return for influencing state contracts. Mr.
Alibozek's boss and Mr. Rowland's former co-chief of staff, Peter N. Ellef, was
forced out as chairman of the state trash authority after the agency lost about
$200 million in state funds in a deal with Enron just before Enron collapsed.
Law enforcement officials who would speak only on the condition of anonymity
said Mr. Ellef is now under investigation in connection with the awarding of
state contracts.

Governor Rowland himself is Connecticut's first chief executive to be fined by
the State Ethics Commission for violating the state gift ban, which forbids
public officials from accepting anything worth more than $10 from people who
have business before the state. Two of the four gifts for which Mr. Rowland paid
fines involved his paying less than the market value for stays at vacation homes
owned by the family of William A. Tomasso, a New Britain builder whose companies
have done millions of dollars worth of work for the state.

Law enforcement officials said Mr. Tomasso's construction company is now under
investigation in connection with two multimillion-dollar state contracts it was
awarded.

No one is accusing the governor, a Republican, of any illegalities, but since
his election to a third term last November, his poll numbers have dropped
dramatically as details of his colleagues' corrupt dealings have emerged. After
issuing an announcement of Mr. Anson's resignation on Thursday, the governor
made no public appearances and took no questions from reporters.

On Friday night, his spokeswoman, Michelle Sullivan, abruptly resigned, saying
that the demands of the job kept her from her family too much. She said the
constant questions over the various investigations did not help matters.

The governor's chief of staff, Dean Pagani, said Mr. Rowland was as surprised as
anyone to find people in his administration accused of criminal activity.

"I would just say that it is very frustrating," Mr. Pagani said. "The governor
comes into work every day and believes that he is working with good, solid
people, and then if somebody fails to live up to that standard, it forces you to
take your eye off the ball, in terms of other issues you would rather be dealing
with."

Mr. Pagani also said no sweeping changes were planned in the way the
administration operates.

The continuing federal investigation centers on how the state awards contracts
to private companies, according to the law enforcement officials. While most are
awarded through competitive bidding, some may be granted based on "special
legislation," which allows the normal bidding process to be circumvented and
gives the public works commissioner much control over who gets a contract.

When Mr. Alibozek pleaded guilty in March, he admitted taking bribes for
steering contracts, but prosecutors did not identify the companies that paid the
bribes. Mr. Anson, who resigned on Thursday, was in charge of the Public Works
Department at the time.

Law enforcement officials said federal prosecutors are looking into the
circumstances under which a Tomasso company, TBI Construction, was hired to
manage several projects worth a total of $100 million.

The Tomasso family, which has been in business in Connecticut for 80 years, has
contributed extensively to both the Republican and Democratic Parties and their
candidates. After suggestions of wrongdoing arose in the spring, the Tomasso
Group, the family's parent company, hired an outside firm to look at how it
handles state contracts, and William Tomasso has recused himself from doing any
business with the state.

Bernard Sullivan, an executive vice president of TBI Construction, said an
internal investigation had concluded that TBI needed to revise some of its
"paperwork" procedures, but nothing else.

"Any suggestion that the family or the company was involved in any wrongdoing is
absolutely false," Mr. Sullivan said.

While the investigation continues, each new development chips away at the layer
of trust between Connecticut's residents and their elected officials.

"The expectation has been that our state government is relatively straight and
honest and that we are among the states with the highest level of integrity,"
said the Connecticut attorney general, Richard Blumenthal. "Certainly these
events undercut that expectation."

Representative Christopher Shays, a Democrat who spent more than a decade in
local and state politics before going to Washington, said the whole system for
ferreting out corruption in Connecticut was flawed.

"We have laws that allow corruption to take place, such as the bribery statute,
yet we have ethics laws that nail someone if they were sitting in an upgraded
seat watching a hockey game," he said. "In my judgment, we strain out gnats and
swallow camels."

The United States attorney in Connecticut, Kevin J. O'Connor, said he was proud
of the work his office had done so far. "We are very pleased with the success we
have enjoyed prosecuting public corruption and we are going to continue to
prosecute it," he said.

International reportCook nears reimbursement OK for Zenith approval in Japan  A
Medical Device Daily Staff Report Cook Medical (Bloomington, Indiana) reported
that it has received preliminary hospital reimbursement for endovascular repair
(EVAR) of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) in Japan. The company's Zenith AAA
stent graft is the only device approved for sale in Japan for this type of
procedure, it said.

Cook said it expects full reimbursement in Japan in March, receipt of which will
launch a complete rollout of the Zenith stent graft system across the Asian
country.

"Cook was first to the market with this life-saving medical device technology in
August 2006 and in just four months we have hit another major milestone with
this news of preliminary reimbursement," said Barry Thomas, global leader of
Cook's Endovascular Therapies division. He said the company's rapid progress in
Japan is the result of a collaborative effort between Cook and its Japanese
distributor,   Medico's Hirata.    A requirement of approval includes providing
detailed clinical training to Japanese physicians to ensure their safe and
effective use of the device. The device, which Cook said is the most widely used
AAA endograft in the world, has a nine-year history of successful use in Europe
and a seven-year history in the U.S., according to the company.

Prior to the development of endovascular treatment, patients diagnosed with a
large, swelling abdominal aortic aneurysm that could rupture faced extensive
open surgery requiring days of recovery time in the hospital and weeks of
post-procedural recovery time before they could resume normal activities.

During endovascular repair, a physician makes two small incisions in the groin
to insert catheters that are guided under fluoroscopy to the site of the
aneurysm. Once in place, the catheters deploy a self-expanding endograft
constructed of polyester surgical graft material supported by stainless steel
Z-stent bodies.

Cook said the major benefits of the Zenith design for endovascular AAA repair
include suprarenal fixation with anchoring barbs to ensure maximal stability and
graft-to-vessel sealing, woven polyester graft material that is lightweight,
strong and shrink-resistant, and the H&L-B One-Shot Introducer System that
allows simple, accurate deployment and positioning of the graft.

Digital pathology solutions launched in India BioImagene   (Cupertino,
California), an image informatics company, reported the launching of its Digital
Pathology solutions for the Indian market at the 12th International Continuing
Medical Education in Surgical Pathology and Cytology conference in Pune, India.

The company said it is viewing the Indian market to expand its global outreach
in the digital pathology market. Its product offering is a complete end-to-end
solution that "will enable scientists and pathologists to implement a
comprehensive scientific data/image management, processing and analysis solution
where image data and metadata will be accessed, viewed and analyzed securely
through a web browser."

According to the company, the system's flexibility would support remote
consultations for projects focused on the cancer market.

BioImagene CEO Mohan Uttarwar said, "BioImagene would like to take digital
pathology to a whole new level by making it easy and affordable for pathologists
to manage, analyze, share, and report on their images with simple mouse clicks."

The company said its digital pathology solutions will benefit pathologists by
digitization of glass slides and their better visualization on a computer

Canada okays Abbott assays, instrument AbbottMolecular (Des Plaines, Illinois)
and Celera (Rockville, Maryland) reported that Health Canada has approved the
Abbott m2000 automated molecular diagnostic instrument and the Abbott RealTime
HIV-1 and hepatitis C virus (HCV) viral load tests for marketing in Canada.

Abbott Molecular markets the m2000 system and a menu of tests throughout the
world as part of a strategic alliance with Celera.

The Abbott RealTime HIV-1 and HCV assays are intended for in vitro diagnostic
use as an indicator of disease prognosis and an aid in the management of
patients undergoing antiviral therapy. They are not intended to be used as
screening tests for HIV-1 or HCV, or as diagnostic tests to confirm the presence
of HIV-1 or HCV infection.

Both tests have been developed for use on the Abbott m2000 system, an automated
instrument intended to improve DNA and RNA testing in molecular laboratories.
The m2000 system is based on real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
technology and is designed to accurately detect and measure life- threatening
viruses and bacteria in patient serum or plasma samples in less than five hours,
the company said, compared to other testing methods that may take up to two
days.

"By automating all of the complex and heavily manual steps often associated with
molecular testing, the m2000 system gives molecular laboratories the ability to
prepare patient samples and deliver test results fast and efficiently," said
Edward Michael, president of Abbott Molecular. "It is expected to help
physicians improve medical care through earlier intervention and the ongoing
monitoring of a patient's response to therapy."

Celera is an Applera (Norwalk, Connecticut) business.

Grey adds majority interest in Spanish agency Grey Healthcare Group (GHG; New
York), a WPP company that is one of the world's largest healthcare
communications firms, said it has acquired a majority stake in Comunicacion y
Servicio Consultores de Marketing Publicidad (CyS; Madrid, Spain), an
independent healthcare communications services agency.

GHG said the acquisition of CyS deepens its European presence and adds an
additional level of expertise to the company's network of 43 offices in 22
countries.

Founded in 1997, CyS's clients include Bristol-Myers Squibb, Pfizer, Abbott
Laboratories, GlaxoSmithKline, Schering-Plough and Boehringer Ingelheim.

CyS will continue to be  managed by General Manager Jose Antonio Alguacil.

Inverness buys Applied Biotech from Apogent for $13.4M, shares

A Medical Device Daily Staff Report  Inverness Medical Innovations (Waltham,
Massachusetts), a provider of consumer healthcare and professional diagnostics
products, and a developer of advanced medical devices, reported that it has
acquired Applied Biotech (San Diego, California) from Apogent Technologies
(Portsmouth, New Hampshire).

Applied Biotech is a manufacturer of rapid diagnostic products in the areas of
women's health, infectious disease and drugs-of-abuse testing.

In exchange for all of the stock of Applied Biotech, Inverness paid Apogent
692,506 shares of Inverness common stock and $13.4 million in cash. The
Inverness shares were issued in a private placement, and Inverness has agreed to
register the shares for resale after the closing.

Inverness financed the cash portion of the purchase price by amending and
restating its current senior credit facilities, led by GE Healthcare Financial
Services, whereby the aggregate amount of the senior credit facilities was
increased to $70 million from $55 million. Merrill Lynch Capital, a division of
Merrill Lynch Business Financial Services, provided the additional funding.

In other dealmaking activity:

Medtronic (Minneapolis, Minnesota) said that its spinal business, Medtronic
Sofamor Danek (Memphis, Tennessee), has reached agreements with Wyeth (Madison,
New Jersey) and Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. (Tokyo) to acquire the
remaining worldwide exclusive rights to promote recombinant human bone
morphogenetic protein (rhBMP-2), a genetically engineered version of a naturally
occurring human protein that forms new bone.

Under the new Wyeth agreement, Medtronic expanded its rights for rhBMP-2 to
include the U.S., Canada, Australia, Latin America and other countries, for
spine, orthopedic and trauma indications. Financial terms were not disclosed.

These new agreements provide Medtronic with worldwide commercial license rights
for rhBMP-2 for all spine, orthopedic and trauma indications. Medtronic reported
recently that Yamanouchi had agreed to grant to Medtronic the exclusive license
for rhBMP-2 for orthopedic surgery in Japan and Asia.

In the U.S. and Canada, rhBMP-2 - marketed as Infuse Bone Graft - was approved
in July 2002 for use in lumbar spinal fusion procedures to treat degenerative
disc disease. In Europe, rhBMP-2 - marketed as InductOs - was approved in
September 2002 for use in the treatment of acute tibia fractures in adults, as
an adjunct to standard care. An orthopedic/trauma indication for this rhBMP-2
technology in the U.S. is being reviewed by the FDA.

The agreements follow a July report that the Center for Medicare & Medicaid
Services (CMS; Baltimore, Maryland) has approved a special add-on payment for
patients who undergo spinal fusion surgery using Infuse Bone Graft. It is the
first time CMS has approved such a payment for a new medical device. Infuse Bone
Graft contains rhBMP-2, and is the only bone graft replacement currently
approved by the FDA specifically for use in lumbar spinal fusion procedures to
treat degenerative disc disease.

"Together, these exciting developments mean that more patients around the world
can potentially benefit from the use of rhBMP-2, which has already been proven
highly effective for people suffering from serious back pain," said Michael
DeMane, president of Medtronic's spinal business.

Infuse Bone Graft and InductOs contain rhBMP-2 applied to an absorbable collagen
sponge, which results in the induction of new bone tissue at the site of
implantation. rhBMP-2 was discovered by Wyeth and co-developed by Wyeth and
Yamanouchi. The protein is manufactured at a Wyeth facility in Andover,
Massachusetts.

Acharon belies part in P2.5M graft case

BYLINE: Jerry Adlaw

LENGTH: 270 words


SOURCED FROM CURRENT GLOBAL NEWSPAPERS AND JOURNALS

GENERAL Santos City Rep. Pedro Acharon Jr., belied accusations that he was
responsible for the P700,000 unliquidated amount from the P2.5 million
expenditures in the Tambayayong Festival held in the United States in 2006.

The Office of the Ombudsman on Jan. 28, 2016 recommended the 60 days preventive
suspension against Acharon with the filing of graft charges before the
Sandiganbayan.

Four other officials were charged along with Acharon in violation of Section 3
(e) of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act for the anomalous utilization of
the P2.5 million funds reportedly spent during the staging of Tambayayong
Festival in California, USA in June 2006 when he was the city mayor.

Acharon said the issue on graft and corrupt practices, in which he was not
directly involved, has been used against him by his political opponent \x96 Ryan
Rivera \x96 who is running under Sen. BongBong Marcos' political party.

"Actually my political opponent used to fan the issue that two of my daughters
have been included in the travel and part of the travel expenses is part of the
P 2.5 million fund. But I spent my own money for my daughters and not from the
budget that they were implicating me with," Acharon said.

He said that the disbursement of funds for the US travel for Tambayayong
Festival was minis-terial by nature and if someone should answer for the
unliquidated funds it is the incumbent vice mayor Shirlyn Banas.

"Vice Mayor Banas can justify the truth of the matter," Acharon added.

Acharon is currently serving his second term, and is seeking reelection.

Can't pick between lemon or lime? Citrus among the easiest to graft

BYLINE: LENNIE BENNETT

SECTION: FLORIDIAN; Pg. 4D

LENGTH: 320 words


Now is the time to plant a citrus tree, and though Mark Safko's grafted version
is unusual, you should consider one with several grafts on it.

Jene Ven Butsel, who owns Jene's Tropicals in St. Petersburg, says her nursery
carries one-fruit trees as well as those with two to four grafts. Some are
standard - an orange, grapefruit and lemon, for example - but she also has
exotic combinations. And if you don't mind waiting a year or so, you could
probably order a citrus tree with a combination you create.

Citrus trees are among the easiest to graft, Van Butsel says, so you could try
it. Your local extension service has information (see list below). If you do
graft yourself, say Safko of St. Petersburg and Al Repetto, the owner of Orange
Blossom Groves, it is very important to buy your "buds" from a source that sells
from disease-free stock, such as the Florida Citrus Arboretum in Winter Park,
which is part of the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.
That was the source for Safko's plants for grafting; he paid 25 cents a bud.

All citrus trees are easy to plant. "Just dig a hole in the ground," Repetto
says. Ven Butsel says you should plant the tree only as deep as it's planted in
the pot, never cover the graft or the trunk, and never put mulch, rocks or other
plant material around it. The trees need full sun, good drainage, probably some
compost mixed into the dirt and fertilizers several times a year. Use 4-6-8
citrus fertilizer most of the year, and 2-10-10 in January or February. Water
daily to establish the tree, then cut back to several times a week.

For balcony gardeners, dwarf varieties make excellent potted trees.

University of Florida Cooperative Extension Service offices in Pinellas County

The U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee has approved legislation that could
provide $2.9 million in funding to several southwestern Ohio projects, according
to the office of Sen. Mike DeWine.

"I am particularly glad that money will be going to a number of programs that
will help improve health care for the residents and, in particular, the children
of Southwest Ohio. I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure this
program funding is included in the final version of the bill."

If the funding is included in the final version:

* The Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center gets $700,000 to purchase
equipment that will allow doctors to measure and translate a patient's proteins
into understanding how they reflect their disease.

The equipment will be used for pediatric diseases, including congenital heart
disease, cancer, obesity, diabetes and epilepsy.

* Community Blood Center and Community Tissue Services get $700,000 to develop
the software and processes that allow the CTS to collect and store information
about the processing of tissue grafts in an electronic format.

TECHNIQUE TO REPAIR RUPTURED ANEURYSM IS USED FOR FIRST TIME IN EMERGENCY IN ST.
CHARLES AREA;
 ST. JOSEPH TEAM DID THE OPERATION;
 "GREAT NEWS FOR ST. CHARLES"

BYLINE: Robin Seaton Jefferson Special To The St. Charles County Post

SECTION: ST. CHARLES COUNTY POST; Pg. 4

LENGTH: 719 words


Last month, a team of surgeons at St. Joseph Health Center repaired a ruptured
aneurysm using an endovascular graft. The procedure, Dr. Todd Neuberger said, is
great news to area residents as it was the first time the condition was repaired
in the area in such a way during an emergency.

"The news is that we did the procedure on a ruptured aneurysm," said Neuberger,
a vascular and general surgeon. "It's great news for the St. Charles community
to hear there is state-of-the-art, leading-edge medicine right here. This is the
first time this was done in a non-teaching hospital in the St. Louis area."

The stent-grafts were approved by the Federal Drug Administration two years ago
for the repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms, he said, but are typically done
during elective, non-emergency surgeries. When an aneurysm ruptures, however,
the traditional method of opening up the abdomen with a 6- to 10-inch incision
is typically done.

"We just happened to have the perfect circumstances with this man," Neuberger
said. "His blood pressure remained stable, and we were able to do it."

An aneurysm is a ballooning in the wall of an artery. Aneurysms can form in
arteries throughout the body, but the most common location is in the abdomen, in
the major artery just below the arteries of the kidneys. Small aortic aneurysms
can be checked by periodic ultrasound testing, but because rupture is the most
frequent complication of an aneurysm, if it enlarges, an operation in needed.

Albert Einstein, Lucille Ball and George C. Scott all suffered aneurysms. Former
presidential candidate Bob Dole recently underwent endovascular repair.

Atherosclerosis is the most common cause of abdominal aortic aneurysms, said Dr.
Thomas Schneider II, also a vascular and general surgeon. Even though men and
women have equal incidences of atherosclerosis, men are 10 times more likely to
develop an aortic aneurysm. Other causes of aneurysm formation that might
explain this difference in occurrence between genders are being studied.

For example, aneurysms may run in some families. Abnormal levels of activity of
certain enzymes may play a role. Trauma, infection of the vascular wall and
congenital defects also can lead to aneurysm formation. A cousin to hardening of
the arteries, aneurysms can also be caused by smoking, high blood pressure and
diabetes.

People who have aortic aneurysms usually have no symptoms until the aneurysm has
ruptured or is about to rupture, Schneider said. More than half of abdominal
aortic aneurysms do not produce symptoms. A person may, however, feel that the
heartbeat is too strong. When a person is reading in bed, the book may bounce
while it is resting on the abdomen.

A ruptured aneurysm causes sudden, severe back and or abdominal pain and low
blood pressure leading to shock. Many people die within minutes of a ruptured
aneurysm. Immediate surgical repair is essential for any chance of survival.

Aneurysms usually are diagnosed in people who are between 50 and 75 years of
age. An aneurysm first may be detected during a routine physical examination, an
ultrasound or abdominal X-rays performed for unrelated symptoms, such as gall
bladder disease, or while the person is hospitalized for another problem.

Surgery to remove an aneurysm is one of the most common vascular procedures
performed at the Vascular Institute. The operation is regarded as safe and the
results excellent. During an endovascular procedure, a nonsurgical approach used
for many non-emergency aortic aneurysm repairs, a synthetic graft - usually a
straight tube of woven Dacron - is sutured to the aorta above and below the
aneurysm. The stents-grafts are delivered to the abdominal aorta through two
tiny incisions in the groin. Using high-tech imaging equipment, the stent-graft
is positioned above and below the aneurysm and then expanded, thereby isolating
it and preventing subsequent rupture. When the graft is in place, blood will
flow through the graft to the legs. Patients are usually only hospitalized for
one or two days and recover in about a week, as opposed to the traditional
method wherein a patient was hospitalized for 10 days and took six to eight
weeks to recover.

For more information on abdominal aortic aneurysm repair call the Vascular
Institute at 636-949-7225.

FDA approves Medtronic's Valiant Captivia system for type B aortic dissections

SECTION: DEALERS; Regulatory Approvals

LENGTH: 341 words



HIGHLIGHT: Medtronic has obtained the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
approval for its Valiant Captivia thoracic stent graft system for the treatment
of type B aortic dissections.


Medtronic has obtained the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for
its Valiant Captivia thoracic stent graft system for the treatment of type B
aortic dissections.

This new indication expands treatment options for the challenging patient
population by providing clinicians with a minimally invasive alternative to open
surgical repair and medical therapy.

FDA approval is based on results from Medtronic' Dissection trial assessing the
safety and efficacy of the Valiant Captivia system. The Dissection study was
conducted at 16 sites in the US.

University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia professor of surgery and director of
the thoracic aortic surgery programme, Dr Joseph Bavaria said: "The trial we
conducted shows that endovascular repair with the Valiant Captivia system
provides a safe, effective and potentially life-saving treatment option for
acute dissection patients."

Dr Bavaria has presented the 12-month data from the 50 patients evaluated in
dissection at the 2014 annual meeting of the Society for Thoracic Surgery on 27
January 2014.

The dissection study has met its primary safety endpoint by achieving an 8%
all-cause mortality rate at 30 days, which represents a three to four-fold
mortality improvement over open surgical repair.

The trial also achieved 100% technical success and 100% coverage of the primary
entry tear at implant.

Valiant Captivia system includes a unique proximal tip-capture mechanism that
enables controlled deployment and accurate placement of the stent graft. The
device is indicated for a variety of thoracic aortic lesions.

Based on independent conformability bench testing of multiple thoracic stent
grafts, the Valiant stent graft is the only device that maintains complete
apposition to the vessel wall regardless of angulation or oversizing.

Medtronic initially launched the Valiant stent graft in Europe in 2005. So far,
the device has been implanted in around 50,000 patients worldwide.

News of new grants ·Isto Technologies (St. Louis, Missouri) reported receiving a
three-year Advanced Technology Program (ATP) award of $2 million from the
National Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST) to support development of
a tissue-engineered neocartilage allograft for the surgical repair of articular
cartilage defects in the knee and other joints. Neocartilage, is cultured from
human chondrocytes, biochemically and histologically similar to normal articular
cartilage on the ends of bones that cushions joints. The project objective is to
develop and characterize a neocartilage-on-bone graft to treat individuals
suffering from large cartilage defects caused by arthritis or injury.  Once the
cultured grafts exhibit the necessary structural, biomechanical and biochemical
properties, it will be evaluated in sheep, with graft performance followed for
up to one year. Neocartilage also is being cultured for high throughput
screening of drug candidates for the treatment of arthritis and inflammation of
the joints. ATP programs provide cost-shared funding to industry, non-profits
and universities to help advance challenging, high-risk research and development
projects.

·Advanced Medical Electronics (AME; Minneapolis, Minnesota) said it has received
a $100,000 phase I SBIR grant from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute
(NHLBI;Bethesda, Maryland) to develop a wearable infrared (IR) augmented reality
viewing system for use by surgeons. In this system, a dual-camera assembly
co-captures normal visible-light images and IR images. Processing circuitry will
seamlessly overlay the two and present a combined spatially-aligned image to the
surgeon. Using this system, the physician will be constantly aware of the
underlying anatomy of a structure as well as the tissue temperatures during
procedures such as thermal treatments. In addition to the NHLBI grant, AME also
reported receiving a $100,000 Phase I SBIR grant from the National Cancer
Institute (also Bethesda) to demonstrate the feasibility of applying IR
microbolometer imaging technology on the distal tip of a flexible endoscope.
This system will accurately measure temperatures during minimally invasive
thermal treatments. The goal is to provide real-time spatially accurate
two-dimensional surface temperature measurements through a flexible endoscope.

·Implant Sciences (Wakefield, Massachusetts) said it has been awarded four
government contracts and grants totaling approximately $1.05 million from the
National Institutes of Health and the Department of Defense (DOD, Washington).
The NIH grants involve the treatment of Spinal Cancer and Ocular melanoma (eye
cancer) using the company's radioactive implant technology.  The DOD contract is
for the development of miniature toxic gas sensors to be worn by firefighters to
sense whether the air in a specific area is safe to breathe. The company said it
expects to recognize approximately $500,000 of these revenues in its present
fiscal year, which ends on June 30, 2002.

·Imetrx (Mountain View, California) reported that its partner, Photon Imaging
(Northridge, California), has received a National Institutes of Health SBIR
grant to fund collaborative development of an intravascular imaging detector to
identify vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque.

NovaBone found equivalent to BMP-2 in use in a composite

NovaBone found equivalent to BMP-2 in use in a composite

By HOLLAND JOHNSON  Medical Device Daily Associate Managing Editor  NovaBone
Products (Jacksonville, Florida) reported that the results of an independent
clinical study of 20 spine fusion surgery patients showed the company's
FDA-cleared synthetic bone graft product, NovaBone, stimulated new bone
formation on an "equivalent basis" compared to bone morphogenic protein (BMP-2)
when each was used in a composite.

The study evaluated 20 consecutive patients undergoing elective,
single-incision, 360-degree lumbar fusion. Patients ranged in age from 34 to 85,
with an average age of 65 years. All patients were having a primary fusion.

Each patient was given a bone graft substitute to enhance spine fusion as
follows:

Right Side: NovaBone + bone marrow + local bone + BMP-2.

Left Side: NovaBone + bone marrow + local bone.

"We have drawn two conclusions from the results of our study," said Craig
Chebuhar, MD, an orthopedic spine surgeon with Pinnacle Orthopaedics and
Sportsmedicine (Marietta, Georgia), the principal investigator for the
independent clinical study. "First, that using local bone graft and bone marrow
aspirate with NovaBone and BMP-2 results in excellent fusion rates for
single-incision, 360-degree lumbar fusion. Secondly, that composite bone
grafting using local bone graft, bone marrow aspirate and NovaBone may be as
effective as a similar composite graft with BMP-2 for posterolateral fusion."

Art Wotiz, president and CEO of NovaBone, said, "We believe the results of this
study will give NovaBone a significant advantage among competing products in the
bone grafting market - a $625 million opportunity in the U.S. alone in 2003,
according to Millennium Research Group." At the very least, he added, "we can
make a very strong case that NovaBone is a great extender for the more expensive
BMP-2 product."

Wotiz said he believes NovaBone has three important advantages over existing
compounds. First, he said it has superior technical characteristics to other
synthetics. Secondly, it can be used in combination with autograft or BMP-2. And
lastly, he said, it is "significantly less expensive" than these other options.

Wotiz told Medical Device Daily that NovaBone was formed in July 2002 to acquire
the rights to the bone-grafting aspects of this technology, originally developed
at the University of Florida (Gainesville) and then acquiredby USBiomaterials
(Alachua, Florida).

When implanted in an osseous defect, Wotiz said the compound "greatly
accelerates" the body's natural healing processes. The net effect of the use of
NovaBone is osteostimulation - i.e., new bone is induced to form, but only in
the presence of existing bleeding bone. Unlike morphogenic proteins and
autograft or allograft, he said that NovaBone would not induce bone formation
away from the bone implantation site, thus eliminating the possibility of
ectopic bone growth.

Wotiz said that the company believes that NovaBone, which is cleared by the FDA
for use in periodontal, craniofacial/maxillofacial and orthopedic applications,
may eventually supplant BMPs, which are currently the hot new bone graft
substitute.

While bone morphogenic proteins are popular, the company noted that they have a
high cost and that ectopic bone growth may occur if any BMPs migrate from the
implant site.

Additionally, Wotiz pointed out that the incremental benefits and long-term
effects of BMP use are unknown at this time, whereas the synthetic NovaBone
product "has been implanted over 700,000 times in human beings over the last 10
years. Its safety record is unassailable, and it's well-known what's going to
happen when you use this product over a long period of time."

Aside from fusions, the compound also is indicated for use in trauma defects,
bony defects, arthroplasty bone stock defects, long bone acute fractures, as a
graft extender and for osteolysis/particulate disease.

Wotiz noted that NovaBone Products has the rights to use the material in
orthopedic applications "from head to toe." The company also sells the compound
as PerioGlas, an oral/periodontal bone-grafting material for use by dentists,
periodontists and oral surgeons. Indications for use include extraction sites,
ridge augmentation, cystic defects, sinus lifts, periodontal defects and dental
implants.

Additionally, the material is used as a cranio-maxillo-facial bone graft
particulate under the name NovaBone-C/M.

Currently, the company is looking for marketing partners, and Wotiz said he
believes with the right partner the company can maintain its independent status
and still take a "significant share of the overall bone graft substitute
market."

He said he and his associates have thus far self-funded the company. While he
said that NovaBone could successfully obtain venture capital if it so chose, he
believes it can fund its own growth with good sales figures.

Wotiz said that Chebuhar recently submitted an abstract of his study to the
North American Spine Society (LaGrange, Illinois) to be considered for inclusion
at next year's annual meeting.

Saving the immune system from itself

BYLINE: GRAEME O'NEILL

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 11

LENGTH: 1287 words


TENS of thousands of Australians suffer from so-called auto-immune disorders _
insulin-dependent diabetes, multiple sclerosis, myasthaenia gravis and
rheumatoid arthritis, to name only a few.

For some reason, the immune system deploys its defensive arsenal against
friendly tissues in the body. In multiple sclerosis, the attack is on the sheath
of myelin protein that insulates nerve cells; in rheumatoid arthritis it is on
the connective tissues of the joints; while in diabetes the target is the
insulin-secreting cells of the pancreas.

Most auto-immune diseases are thought to result from the interaction of
environmental agents with genetic factors unique to certain individuals.

During the past decade, immunologists and molecular biologists have made
phenomenal progress in understanding how the immune system functions, and have
been able to elucidate some of the fine detail of how the various classes of
cells in the immune system communicate and coordinate the body's defences
against the myriad microbes and alien substances that daily threaten our health.

The research has been outstanding, but this month a Chicago-Seattle research
team produced a discovery that ranks with any in the past half century of
immunology _ a discovery that simultaneously promises an effective therapy for a
whole range of auto-immune diseases, and a way of preventing the immune system
from rejecting transplanted organs.

Research groups led by Dr Jeffrey Bluestone, of the University of Chicago
Medical Centre, and Dr Peter Linsley of the Bristol Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical
Research Institute in Seattle, Washington, have discovered a way of inducing the
immune system to ignore friendly proteins, in the case of auto-immune disorders,
and to tolerate foreign proteins, in the case of tissue or organ transplants.

So far the technique has been demonstrated only in mice, but there are prospects
for human therapies by the mid-1990s. It employs a hybrid protein, devised by
genetic engineers, to block a key step in the cell-to-cell chain of command that
results in swarms of hunter-killer lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell)
being dispatched to destroy an invader.

From the moment that the immune system begins to develop in a human embryo, it
learns to recognise and tolerate friendly proteins. If it did not, the embryo
would virtually self-destruct from a massive auto-immune attack.

Remarkably, for every protein in the body, there are squads of hunter-killer
lymphocytes programmed specifically to recognise its various sub-units or
antigens. But these lymphocytes simply wander around the body without mounting
an attack because they have been deactivated or "anergised" _ in simpler terms,
the cells become apathetic.

How they get that way remains a mystery, but immunologists now know that
hunter-killer lymphocytes are activated by another type of immune-system cell,
the B-cell.

B-cells are best known as the cells that secrete antibodies, the specialised
protein molecules that latch onto and neutralise foreign material or microbes.
B-cells thus mediate the two main types of immune response: the humoral or
antibody response, and the cell-mediated response, in which hunter-killer
lymphocytes seek out and destroy cells that have been infected by viruses or
bacteria.

B-cells and T-lymphocytes have no intelligence; with their limited repertoire of
behaviors and limited ability to communicate with each other, they bear
comparison with the Daleks in the BBC science-fiction serial `Dr Who'.

The B-cell rolls up to a waiting T-cell, and with one claw extended, displays a
sample of protein from a dismembered invader. The T-cell extends its receptor
claw to receive the sample, studies it and stores a description permanently in
memory.

The B-cell now clicks its second claw into a specially designed socket on the
T-cell's second claw, and transmits a signal that activates the T-cell's killer
instinct. With an image of its protein target already fixed in memory, the
T-cell begins to divide repeatedly, until there are huge numbers of identical
clones of itself, all primed to recognise and attack the hostile protein.

THE Chicago-Seattle research team focused on the second step of this
pas-de-deux, in which the B-cell inserts a ligand (joining) protein into the
complementary receptor protein on the surface of the T-cell, turning the T-cell
into a killer.

They wanted to allow the first step to proceed normally, so that the T-cell
would know how to recognise the particular protein fragment proffered by the
B-cell. But they wanted to block the second step, so that it never received the
instruction to switch on and destroy the protein _ in other words, an anergised
T-cell that would recognise the protein but tolerate its presence in the body.

The researchers used recombinant DNA technology to join components of two
naturally occurring proteins. The hybrid protein created from this process acts
as a tight-fitting cap, clinging to the second claw of the B-cell, so that it is
permanently prevented from fitting into the socket of the receptor on the T-cell
(see diagram).

The B-cell never gets to send its activation signal, and the T-cell becomes
anergic to the protein fragment that the B-cell has just programmed it to
recognise.

In what will go down as a classic experiment, Dr Bluestone and Dr Linsley
injected the hybrid protein into diabetic mice that had received a graft of
insulin-secreting pancreatic cells. Normally, the immune system would have
detected the graft, and programmed squads of T-cells to destroy the alien
proteins in its tissues.

THIS is exactly what happened in a control group of mice which received the
graft, but not the hybrid protein injection. They rejected the graft within six
days.

In the treated mice, the grafted cells were left unharmed, and began secreting
insulin, curing the mice of their diabetes. Some 80 days later, without any
immunosuppressive drugs, or further treatment with the hybrid protein, the mice
were still healthy and secreting normal amounts of insulin.

In a second experiment, the researchers removed the grafts. Half the mice were
given a new graft from the same host, while the rest received a graft from a new
host, but this time none were treated with the blocking hybrid protein.

The mice receiving the identical graft accepted it; their immune systems had
already learned to tolerate the foreign tissue. The others rejected the grafts
from the second host.

The result, hailed by `Science' as "the Holy Grail of immunology", confirmed
that the immune system was functioning normally, even though it now recognised
the foreign proteins from the original graft as "friendly".

It contrasts starkly with the effect of the immunosuppressive drugs like
cyclosporine, which suppress the entire immune system, leaving transplant
patients at increased risk of infection and cancer.

The hybrid protein _ known as CTLA4Ig _ seems to be harmless to the body at
therapeutic doses, and another research team at the Howard Hughes Medical
Research Institute in Michigan has recently demonstrated that it can be used to
make one species of rat tolerant to a heart transplant from a different species.

Researchers are still being cautious about its potential as a new, highly
specific immunosuppressive drug for helping human transplant patients accept
grafted organs, and for treating auto-immune disorders.

The signs are all positive so far. And if more good news is needed, at
Melbourne's Walter and Eliza Hall Medical Research Institute, Professor Len
Harrison has developed a similar technique that could allow doctors to prevent
diabetes in susceptible individuals before the disease develops and wipes out
their insulin-secreting cells _ more on this in a future column.

Bolton Medical begins Phase II US clinical trial of Treovance abdominal stent-
graft system

SECTION: THE BOARDROOM; Product Developments

LENGTH: 282 words



HIGHLIGHT: Bolton Medical, a medical device manufacturer, has initiated its
Phase II US clinical trial to study the safety and effectiveness of the
Treovance abdominal stent-graft with Navitel delivery system.


The first two cases were performed on 25 November 2013 by Carolina Vascular,
Mission Hospital, Asheville vascular surgeons Dr John Henretta and Dr Mike
Douglas.

Dr Henretta noted both cases went really well.

"It's a nice device that allows for precise placement. Its delivery system is
easy to advance through the iliac anatomy, and the material is non-porous. I
feel secure about the device's long term-durability and we look forward to
enrolling more patients," Dr Henretta added.

The third case was performed the same week on 27 November 2013 by University of
Massachusetts Medical Center, Worcester vascular surgeon Dr Andres Schanzer.

The primary objective of the clinical study is to assess the safety and
effectiveness of the Treovance abdominal stent-graft in subjects with infrarenal
aortic aneurysms.

Results of this study will support approval of the product in the US. Phase II
of the study will include 150 patients enrolled at 30 institutions located
throughout the US.

The Treovance abdominal stent-graft offers many key features which include: 1. a
three-piece, adaptable system that can accommodate a wide-range of anatomies, 2.
active fixation through suprarenal and infrarenal barbs permitting proximal and
supplemental fixation in highly angulated necks, and, 3. a highly flexible
design, conformable even in difficult anatomies.

The Treovance abdominal stent-graft is offered with the Navitel delivery system,
an intuitive low profile system featuring mechanical advantage and a completely
detachable sheath assembly.

The Navitel delivery system also includes the reliable proximal clasping system
of Bolton Medical's Relay Thoracic stent-graft, allowing for accurate
deployment.

Protein Labs' Stock Slides After Setback

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER

SECTION: Section 1;   Page 48;   Column 6;   Business/Financial Desk

LENGTH: 493 words

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, July 3


Shares in Protein Design Labs Inc. lost one-third of their value today following
the company's announcement late Friday that its lead drug had failed in advanced
clinical trials.

Protein Design shares tumbled $6.875, or 33 percent, to $13.875 in Nasdaq
trading. The stock had reached a 52-week high of $26.75 earlier this year.

Protein Design, a biotechnology company based in Mountain View, Calif., and
Hofmann-La Roche Inc., its corporate partner, announced after the market's close
on Friday that their jointly developed monoclonal antibody, Zenapax, had not
been effective in the prevention of graft-versus-host disease, a common
complication involving the rejection of bone marrow transplants. Hofmann- La
Roche, based in Nutley, N.J., is a unit of Roche Holdings Ltd. of Switzerland.

Roche said it planned to continue two Zenapax trials to evaluate the drug's
efficacy in preventing acute rejection of kidney transplants.

Concerning the safety of the drug, the two companies said their preliminary
analysis indicated that the safety profile for Zenapax associated with graft
-versus-host disease was good, with only two reports of serious adverse effects.

Cary L. Queen, Protein Design's vice president for research, said in a telephone
interview that it was difficult to extrapolate the prospects of the drug from a
trial for one disease to another. "Graft-versus-host disease is a very difficult
indication and has a very high mortality rate," he said. "We think kidney
transplant is a less challenging indication." he said. Early trial data
regarding kidney transplants was encouraging, the company said.

In the graft-versus-host trial, only one patient among 140 treated developed an
immune response to the drug, Mr. Queen said. That indicated that Protein
Design's technology for "humanizing" antibodies derived from mice was effective.
The response to the so-called human anti-mouse antibody has limited the possible
uses of traditional monoclonal antibodies.

The failure of Zenapax in graft-versus-host disease was "very surprising from
the standpoint that Roche has been very bullish about this molecule in this
indication and in kidney transplant," said Edmund Debler, an analyst with Mehta
& Isaly. He noted that Roche had gone from a 24-patient study for the treatment
of the disease to a 210-patient study for its prevention, an uncharacteristic
jump for a large pharmaceutical company. "They went down the classic biotech
path to a failed trial," he said.

Protein Design has two other monoclonal antibodies, both derived from humans,
for the treatment of hepatitis B and cytomegalovirus, in a collaboration with
Corange, the German pharmaceuticals conglomerate. Both of these molecules have
been delayed by as much as one year in clinical trials because of difficulties
in manufacturing.

Corange owns 15 percent of Protein Design Labs and Hofmann-La Roche 8 percent.
Mr. Queen said the company has $110 million in cash.

ORTHOFIX INTERNATIONAL Boston, Massachusetts Medical Products Maker Has High
Hopes For New Bone Treatment

What looked like an investment gone sour for Orthofix International now appears
to have big potential. And it's helped shares recover from a steep slide that
bottomed out a year ago.

This year, shares more than tripled, reaching 33.50 on Oct. 29. Since then,
they've settled back.

The company's third-quarter sales of $135 million outpaced analysts' predictions
of $133 million. "The quarterly results show the turnaround is well underway,"
said William Plovanic, analyst with Canaccord Adams.

Orthofix, which has its operational headquarters in Boston, has high hopes its
new, high-profile product, Trinity Evolution, will grow revenue by as much $100
million a year.

Trinity Evolution is a paste-like compound whose key component is adult stem
cells from recently deceased donors.

Bone Grafts

Stem cells can grow into whatever the body needs them to be, including new bone.
Orthofix is counting on its technology to displace the current standard of care:
bone grafts taken from elsewhere in the patient's body.

Taking bone from another site means more pain for the patient, more risk of
infection and longer recovery. Trinity Evolution prevents the complications of
bone grafts while accelerating healing with stem cells.

It has a competitor, Osteocel, marketed by San Diego-based NuVasive. And thereby
hangs a tale.

In 2006, Orthofix bought a private company called Blackstone, which provided an
entry to a new area - spinal implants and marketing rights to Osteocel. Orthofix
paid $333 million cash.

A year earlier, Springfield, Mass.- based Blackstone had licensed Osteocel from
Columbia, Md.-based maker Osiris in 2005. Blackstone's rights to market Osteocel
were one of the big attractions for Orthofix.

"We borrowed the money to get into the spine business," Chief Executive Alan
Milinazzo told IBD. "We gave up no equity, but we took on long-term debt." That
debt would come back to bite them.

Orthofix began integrating Blackstone's product line of surgical devices and
implants, and it started selling Osteocel under the brand Trinity.

Blackstone was supposed to be accretive in mid-2008. Orthofix shares hit an
all-time high of 66 at the end of 2007.

But in July 2008, Osiris sold its Osteocel business to NuVasive. Orthofix tried
but failed to get a federal court to block the deal.

The outcome: Orthofix lost the right to sell its Trinity-branded Osteocel. It
had to find a replacement product or miss out on a piece of a market Milinazzo
says could be worth $200 million to $300 million a year.

In August 2009, Orthofix made a 10-year deal with the non-profit Musculoskeletal
Transplant Foundation of Edison, N.J., to process Trinity Evolution. The
foundation, a consortium of medical schools, organ-acquisition organizations and
tissue-recovery groups, is the U.S.' largest tissue bank.

Less than a year later, Orthofix rolled out Trinity Evolution, too late to have
an impact on this year's earnings. Still, 2009 looks to be a good year, even
with minimal input from Trinity Evolution.

Third-quarter earnings of 36 cents a share exceeded the Street's expectations of
34 cents. Third-quarter sales were up 7% over the 2008 third quarter.

While Trinity Evolution saw only $3.5 million sales for the quarter, its gross
profit margin doubled. Its predecessor had showed a gross profit margin of 50%.

The debt for the Blackstone buy still hangs over the company. "When things
turned sour, they started losing money and then the credit crisis hit," said
Plovanic. "Their credit got killed, and the stock got punished."

At the worst of times, the firm had to renegotiate that debt. It had borrowed
for the Blackstone deal at LIBOR plus 1.75% and renegotiated for LIBOR plus
4.5%.

Since then, Orthofix has been paying down debt as fast as it can. "It's the
primary use for our cash," Milinazzo says. Three years after the Blackstone buy,
the company owes $258 million.

Management Changes

In the aftermath of the Blackstone buy, Orthofix hired a new chief financial
officer and made other management changes in its spinal division. "They now have
that going well," Plovanic said.

Other divisions did not get short shrift, Milinazzo says. "We never took our
eyes off our core business in stimulation, orthopedics and sports medicine," he
said.

Orthofix makes and sells devices that stimulate bone growth with
electro-magnetic energy. The line is called Physio-Stim. The gear can be worn
comfortably for up to three hours a day without impeding normal activity.

The company's long list of orthopedic products include braces and bone screws
and devices that can lengthen damaged bones. Its sports-related line offers
splints, joint braces, and cold-therapy devices.

The company sells worldwide with operations in the major European countries,
Mexico and Brazil.

Orthofix shares could go up another 50%, Plovanic says. "The upside depends on
how much they reinvest in the business," he said.

International Report: Gore launches new Excluder in Australia

LENGTH: 485 words

Staff Report

W. L. Gore & Associates (Flagstaff, Arizona) reported the Australia and New
Zealand launch of an expanded treatment range, including lower profile
components for the Gore Excluder AAA Endoprosthesis used to treat abdominal
aortic aneurysms (AAAs). The 31 mm trunk-ipsilateral component and 32 mm aortic
extender will be used with an 18 Fr and 17 Fr Gore DrySeal Sheath respectively,
reduced from 20 Fr. For the contralateral legs, the reduced profile sizes allow
the 12-20 mm contralateral leg component to be used with a 12 Fr Gore DrySeal
Sheath, the 23 mm to be used with a 14 Fr introducer sheath, and the 27 mm to be
used with a 15 Fr introducer sheath. In addition, a new large diameter 35 mm
trunk-ipsilateral leg and 36 mm aortic extender components will treat 30-32 mm
vessel treatment range which expands overall treatment range to 19-32 mm. The 35
mm trunk-ipsilateral component and 36 mm aortic extender will be used with an 18
Fr Gore DrySeal Sheath.

No changes have been made to the Gore Excluder Device - instead, Gore has
implemented an innovative process using ePTFE materials to constrain the device
onto the catheter. The lowering of the device profile exemplifies Gore's
commitment to improving patient safety while maintaining ease-of-use for the
delivery of the Gore Excluder Device.

"The availability of the expanded treatment range of the Gore Excluder Device,
in addition to the reduced profile components, provides physicians with a proven
and durable option to better treat a broader range of patients diagnosed with
abdominal aortic aneurysms," said Stefan Ponosh, MD, a Vascular Surgeon at Sir
Charles Gairdner Hospital, Perth, Western Australia. "Reducing the profile of
these devices allows more patients to benefit from minimally invasive access
approaches to endovascular aortic repair."

The Gore Excluder AAA Endoprosthesis is an endovascular stent-graft that seals
off the aneurysm and creates a new path for blood flow. The device is inserted
through a small incision in the patient's leg using a catheter-based delivery
technique. Once the physician has positioned the graft in the diseased aorta,
the Gore C3 Delivery System uniquely and intuitively enables repositioning of
the stent-graft. The ability to reposition the device may minimize complications
that could occur if the graft needs to be moved after the initial deployment.

The Gore Medical Products Division has provided creative therapeutic solutions
to complex medical problems for more than 35 years. During that time, more than
35 million innovative Gore Medical Devices have been implanted, saving and
improving the quality of lives worldwide. The Gore Medical family of products
includes vascular grafts, endovascular and interventional devices, surgical
meshes for hernia repair, soft tissue reconstruction, staple line reinforcement
and sutures for use in vascular, cardiac, and general surgery.

o Hitchcock Medical Center (Lebanon, New Hampshire) and Masimo (Irvine,
California), the inventor of Pulse CO-Oximetry and Measure-Through Motion and
Low Perfusion pulse oximetry, jointly reported the peer-reviewed publication of
an in-depth, 21-month clinical study on the impact of the Masimo Patient
SafetyNet remote monitoring and clinician notification system. The study,
featured in the February 2010 issue of Anesthesiology, is the first published
report to demonstrate that continuous pulse oximetry monitoring and clinician
notification in post-surgical patients on the general floor leads to a
"significant drop" in key clinical outcome measures, including 65% fewer rescue
events, 48% fewer ICU transfers, and reduced annualized ICU time by 135 days.

o Maquet Cardiovascular (Wayne, New Jersey) reported the initiation of the
OPTION (Optimal Improvement of Vein Graft Patency Long Term by the
Implementation Of Novel Endoscopic Harvesting Techniques) study. This clinical
trial is designed to evaluate the equivalence of Endoscopic Vessel Harvesting
(EVH) in Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) surgery compared with historical
data for open vein harvesting. OPTION is a 100-patient, single-center study that
will evaluate vein graft patency at one month and one year following CABG
surgery. The study standardizes a number of pre- and post-harvesting factors and
will use the Vasoview Hemopro technology system, as well as experienced
harvesters with the appropriate skill level to best preserve and protect the
vessel.

of its Therapeutic Lung Flute. This hand-held, reusable therapeutic device
supplements the patient's natural mucus clearing system by introducing low
frequency sound waves into the lungs. Respiratory illnesses such as COPD,
tuberculosis, lung cancer, chronic bronchitis, community acquired pneumonia and
asthma are on the rise and becoming an increasing burden on the healthcare
system. The application follows the successful completion of a clinical trial at
the University at Buffalo (SUNY) and the Western New York VA Medical Center
during 2009.

o Osiris Therapeutics (Columbia, Maryland) said that it has achieved a $750,000
milestone payment from the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) for
completing enrollment in a Phase II clinical trial evaluating Prochymal, an
adult mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy, as a treatment for patients recently
diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. Prochymal is a preparation of mesenchymal stem
cells (MSCs) formulated for intravenous infusion. The MSCs used in Prochymal are
isolated from the bone marrow of healthy young adult donors, avoiding the
controversy surrounding embryonic and fetal cell sources. They are grown in
culture, permitting large-scale production. Because the cells can be expanded,
thousands of doses can be produced from a single donation. Studies suggest MSCs
are able to safely facilitate tissue repair through a number of mechanisms.

o Suneva Medical (Maui, Hawaii) reported interim results from its prospective,
open-label, five-year safety and patient satisfaction study on Artefill for
nasolabial fold (NLF) correction. The study assessed adverse events with
Artefill starting at 6-months post treatment. Initial results show the incidence
of adverse events with Artefill compare favorably to the current label, and that
the majority of patients (88%) reported a high satisfaction rating.  The company
claims that Artefill is the first and only FDA-approved microsphere-enhanced
collagen filler for the correction of nasolabial folds, better known as smile
lines.

CryoLife to undergo changes in face of regulatory issues

CryoLife to undergo changes in face of regulatory issues

By HOLLAND JOHNSON  Medical Device Daily Senior Staff Writer While troubled
CryoLife (Kennesaw, Georgia), a developer of cryopreserved and tissue-engineered
implantable heart valves, vascular and orthopedic grafts, and surgical
adhesives, acknowledged it will have an off-year in relation to earnings, it all
but said during a Wednesday second-quarter earnings conference call that it will
not sit idly by and watch its revenues subside.

During that call, the company unveiled a new priority pathway for its product
lines and addressed recent regulatory issues concerning its orthopedic and
vascular cryopreserved human tissues brought out by the FDA and the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC; Atlanta, Georgia).

D. Ashley Lee, vice president and chief financial officer, reported that
revenues for the quarter rose 18% to $25.7 million, up from a year-ago figure of
$21.7 million. Additionally, he said 2Q02 net income rose 3.7% to $2.8 million,
or 14 cents a share, from $2.5 million, or 13 cents a share, in the same period
a year ago (Medical Device Daily, July 24, 2002). However, this was short of
analyst projections of between 17 cents and 19 cents a share reported by Thomson
First Call. The company also projected full-year per-share earnings of 54 cents
to 57 cents, dramatically less than the analysts' estimates of 74 cents.

The company's shares have fallen by more than 64%, from just over $27 a share to
under $9, since the FDA issued its warning letter in June (MDD, June 25, 2002).

The company attributed its financial shortfall to expected higher insurance,
legal and regulatory costs. The company also reported earlier this week that its
board had authorized a share repurchase program of up to $10 million that began
on Thursday.

While the company reduced its guidance for the year in the face of the potential
regulatory issues and numerous pending shareholder and civil lawsuits, not
surprisingly, it maintained that overall "business is [still] good."

Steven Anderson, president and CEO, said CryoLife would begin a major focus to
gaining approval from the FDA for its Synegraft bovine allograft heart valves.
These grafts have been implanted as arteriovenous (AV) access devices and for
peripheral vascular reconstruction.  Since February 2000, Anderson said
approximately 813 SynerGraft valves have been implanted. Of these valves, 800
remain implanted at this time. Additionally, the company has implanted 648
processed SynerGraft patches for cardiac reconstruction. The company found upon
examination of the explanted allograft heart valves showed that the valves were
re-modeling in vivo. In addition, since January 2001 CryoLife has implanted
about 394 vascular grafts processed with SynerGraft technology. About 381 of
these grafts remain implanted. CryoLife received a CE mark for SynerGraft
vascular grafts made from bovine ureters in August 2001.

As a result of what it said are successful clinical results of the SynerGraft
bovine vascular grafts for AV access, CryoLife has moved up the priority of
these grafts and will apply for an investigational device exemption (IDE) in
4Q02. CryoLife said it expects to gain IDE approval by 1Q03 and would enroll
patients in the clinical trial at that time. Based on an estimated clinical
trial of two years and required administrative follow-up, the company thinks it
could receive premarket approval some time in late 2005 or early 2006.

"Based on market data available to CryoLife, we anticipate that the device could
potentially address up to 75,000 to 80,000 of the 234,000 AV access procedures
performed annually in the U.S., and with an anticipated charge for the grafts of
$1,200," Anderson said. He noted that number is three times the $400 sales price
of current AV access grafts. And, he added that because the device is made from
a bovine ureter, it does not have the supply constraint of human vascular grafts
.

In a related move, the company has decided to withdraw its IDE for the
CryoLife-O'Brien prosthetic heart valve. Anderson said this strategy will help
focus the company on the SynerGraft Vascular IDE for AV access, and could save
the company about $2 million a quarter. The company will continue to distribute
the valve internationally.

The company also said it is on track to sell more than  $20 million in Bioglue
products this year. BioGlue is currently approved as an adjunct to the use of
sutures and staples in vascular and cardiac repair to achieve hemostasis.

Anderson said the company anticipates applying to the FDA for additional
indications for the presently approved BioGlue formulation for both hernia
repair and sealing dura mater, the fibrous membrane that surrounds the spinal
cord and the brain. He said the company's present data indicates that of the
approximate 1 million hernia procedures per year, 285,000 may be appropriate for
the use of BioGlue. In addition, the market for dura mater sealant indicates
that there are about 112,000 procedures that might be applicable for the use of
BioGlue. "If one 5ml cartridge was used in each of the appropriate procedures,
the markets would be $70 million and $39 million, respectively," he said.
CryoLife said it would probably file IDE applications for hernia repair and dura
mater sealing in the 2Q03.

Conversely, the company has decided to temporarily shelve potential PMA
supplements related to a BioGlue Gel and BioGlue Foam. This, it said, was due to
additional ingredients required for the BioGlue Gel and BioGlue Foam from the
basic BioGlue formulation. CryoLife would have needed to conduct lengthy
clinical trials under an IDE and additional biocompatibility and shelf life
testing to support a PMA.

James Vander Wyk, PhD, vice president, regulatory affairs and quality assurance,
reported on the company's responses to recent regulatory woes, primarily
associated with its orthopedic implants, which have been linked to one death
thus far.

Vander Wyk said the company, which supplies about 90% of the cryopreserved human
tissue in the U.S., expects to have a meeting with the FDA, based on its warning
letter from the agency, once that agency reviews the company's responses to all
the points contained in the letter. He said that two of the FDA recommendations
- adoption of refrigeration protocols to extend warm ischemic time and the
American Association of Tissue Banking standard for pre-processing bacterial
testing that became effective this month - already have been implemented.

Vander Wyk emphasized several points concerning the problems associated with the
implants. He said the company has "always tested the tissue distributed by it
for the presence of bacteria and fungi, using a companion sample." He added that
the company  "has always tested for both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria,
including the Clostridium species [attributed to the one known fatality], along
with the Clostridium spore form. He also noted that if a companion tissue
exhibited growth of microorganisms, "CryoLife has always discarded the related
tissue."

The company also said it only processes and releases tissues recovered from
donors that are free of known infections, both bacterial and viral, as well as
risks of such infections.

Importantly, Vander Wyk noted that the company's FDA-mandated complaint file
concerning reports of alleged infections associated with CryoLife tissues, both
substantiated or not, over the period from Jan. 1, 1999, to June 30 of this year
indicated a total reported infection rate of 0.2% for orthopedic tissues and
0.56% for allograft heart valves. He noted that these reports include all
allegations of infections in allograft recipients and do not "necessarily"
correlate to infections caused by the implanted tissue.

He also noted that the rate for CryoLife valves "is substantially lower than the
published infection rates of 1.6% for sterile mechanical heart valves and 1.2%
for sterile bioprosthetic heart valves." The reported infection rate associated
with CryoLife orthopedic allografts is 0.2%, vs. a 0.6% to 2.2% infection rate
reported by the CDC for all sterile prosthetic orthopedic devices.

AIDS test turns up negative for recipient of tissue graft

SECTION: NATIONAL; NATIONAL DIGEST; Pg. 7A

LENGTH: 519 words

DATELINE: VIRGINIA BEACH, Va.; LOS ANGELES; CAPE CANAVERAL; PORTERVILLE, Calif.;
BALSAM LAKE, Wis.; YORK, Pa.; WASHINGTON



A transplant service Sunday reported the first negative AIDS test result for a
patient who received tissue transplanted from a man who likely contracted the
disease shortly before he was slain in 1985. Three recipients of organs from the
man have died of AIDS and three others who got bone grafts from him have tested
positive for the disease. More than 40 other people who received tissue from the
man are being tested. The test that proved negative was performed on a patient
who received a freeze-dried tissue graft.  Freeze-drying is used mostly on bone,
but officials at LifeNet Transplant Services of Virginia Beach wouldn't be
specific. The graft was treated with ethanol, an alcohol sterilizer that would
have made transmission of the disease unlikely, said Doug Wilson, spokesman for
LifeNet. The donor's tissue was used after tests failed to detect the virus. In
1985, such tests were not as sophisticated as those used now.
 Nine arrested in rampage
 LOS ANGELES About 500 people leaving a college party went on a rampage early
Sunday, smashing windows and ransacking stores, police said. About 120 police
officers quelled the disturbance in 90 minutes, Lt. John Weaver said. He said
nine people were arrested on charges including burglary, vandalism and breaking
curfew. At least six stores in the trendy Westwood entertainment district were
burglarized and 17 were vandalized, police said. The melee erupted as youths
were leaving an annual festival at the University of California, Los Angeles.
Police said the festival increasingly is being attended by gang members.
 Blood banks to be revamped
 WASHINGTON The American Red Cross will shut down its 53 regional blood centers
to install a new computer system and implement new blood testing measures in an
attempt to solve persistent safety and management problems. The Red Cross' board
of directors Sunday unanimously agreed to the plan, which is estimated to cost $
100-million and next year will result in regional Red Cross blood banks being
closed on a rotating basis for several weeks each. In a statement, Red Cross
President Elizabeth Hanford Dole called the plan a "complete transformation of
the Red Cross blood program to address the problem of AIDS in the blood supply."

· Aastrom Biosciences (Ann Arbor, Michigan) and its wholly owned subsidiary,
Zellera AG (Berlin, Germany), said that its clinical study in collaboration with
BG- Kliniken 'Bergmannsheil' Ruhr-University (Bochum, Germany) has been
initiated. The bone graft clinical study will use Aastrom's bone-forming Tissue
Repair Cells (TRC) in combination with a commercial synthetic bone graft matrix,
provided through a collaboration with Mathys Medical (Bettlach, Switzerland), to
treat patients with serious leg fractures that require a bone graft for
recovery.

· Biomet (Warsaw, Indiana) said that its subsidiary, Implant Innovations (3i;
Palm Beach Gardens, Florida), has introduced the newest addition to its
Osseotite family, the Osseotite Certain Implant System. The Osseotite Certain
Implant System is the first internal-connection system, and provides clinicians
the advantage of a significantly more efficient protocol. Unique to the
Osseotite Certain Implant System is the QuickSeat Connection, which uses a
system of engagement fingers that produce an audible and tactile "click" when
the abutment or coping is properly seated important in internal-connection
designs, a deep 4 mm multi-level engagement zone, thick coronal walls and a
stress-relieving connection provide for proper initial stability. The system's
mountless, no-touch delivery method enhances efficiency and expands the
clinician's options after placement, the company said.

· Candela (Wayland, Massachusetts) said it has received additional clearances
from the FDA to market its Vbeam and Cbeam for the non-invasive treatment of
acne. Vbeam and Cbeam represent the "gold standard" in pulsed dye lasers to
treat facial veins, rosacea, leg veins, port wine stains, scars, wrinkles,
psoriasis, stretch marks and warts, the company said, and have been shown to
temporarily reduce acne lesions by targeting P. acnes bacteria in the skin.

·Cardima (Fremont, California) has submitted an amendment to its premarket
approval application to the FDA for approval to market the Revelation Tx linear
ablation catheter to treat paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. The Revelation Tx
system is a minimally invasive, single-use, microcatheter-based product designed
to provide easy access to arrhythmia-causing tissue, creating linear lesions or
restricted pathways, and restoring normal sinus rhythm to the heart using
radiofrequency energy. The company said it believes that the additional data and
analysis, including data obtained from an expanded patient population, provide
clear and concise safety and efficacy data, and said it is hopeful that the FDA
will concur that the amended PMA application fulfills the agency's requirements
for product approval.

A better fix for torn ACLs

LENGTH: 618  words

DATELINE: Lahore



 Washington: American Association for the Advancement of Science has issued the
following news release:



  According to the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, a torn anterior
cruciate ligament, or ACL, is one of the most common knee injuries.
Approximately 200,000 Americans experience a torn ACL each year, and more than
half undergo surgical repairs. Now, researchers at the University of Missouri
School of Medicine have developed a model to show that a newer surgical
technique results in a stronger, more natural ACL repair.





 "The knee is a complex joint supported by four main ligaments," said James
Cook, D.V.M., Ph.D., director of the Division of Research at MU Health Care's
Missouri Orthopaedic Institute and senior author of the study. "Of these four
ligaments, the ACL is most prone to injury. The key to a successful repair is
for the graft to integrate, or grow into the bones of the joint just like a
normal ACL. We developed a research model that for the first time allowed us to
compare the level of healing achieved by different surgical methods to determine
the best option for graft integration."



 With traditional ACL repair, surgeons create a tunnel in the upper and lower
bones of the knee joint. Each end of the graft is secured to the sides of these
tunnels using screws to press the new ligament against the tunnel walls. The
traditional method secures the graft to the bones during the healing process,
allowing the new ligament to attach and function as an ACL replacement.



 "The traditional repair does provide stability and allows the new graft to grow
to bone," said Cook, who also serves as the William C. Allen Endowed Professor
for Orthopaedic Surgery at the MU School of Medicine and director of the Mizzou
BioJoint Center. "However, the graft-to-bone attachment with this method is more
like a spot weld, rather than a fully integrated repair. Additionally, the
press-fit mechanism of the screws can cause cell and tissue damage in the new
graft. Both of these issues result in a repair that may be prone to failure."



 Using a canine model developed by the researchers, the team compared the
traditional method with a newer suspensory fixation repair.



 "With the newer suspensory system, sutures pull the graft into sockets created
in the two bones," Cook said. "The sutures are secured to a button on the
surface of the bones to hold the graft in place. With this method, the graft
fills the entire socket like a potted plant, allowing the graft the best
opportunity to fully integrate into the bone like a normal ligament. The
suspensory method also reduces cell and tissue damage to the graft."



 The researchers found that only four of the six dogs treated with the
traditional screw fixation method achieved full functional healing, and none of
the grafts fully integrated into the bones like a native ligament. Of the dogs
treated with the newer suspensory system, all six achieved functional and
natural healing.



 "Using our research model, we were able to validate that the suspensory
fixation method is not only stronger in terms of securing the graft initially,
but also results in more natural healing," Cook said. "This newer method
provides the best option for achieving graft-to-bone integration, and may allow
patients to return to a more active lifestyle with a new ACL that is less likely
to fail."



 The study, "Suspensory Versus Interference Screw Fixation for Arthroscopic
Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction in a Translational Large-Animal
Model," recently was published in The Journal of Arthroscopic & Related Surgery.

Molly gets 1st skin grafts; parents receive donation at Austin-Decatur game

BYLINE: Paul Huggins, The Decatur Daily, Ala.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 482 words


Aug. 31--The past few days were both encouraging and disappointing for Molly
Moses.

Surgeons on Thursday morning made the first skin grafts to the 16-year-old
Decatur High School junior's leg wound and deemed them a success, said her aunt,
Karry Williams. The only disappointment was her doctor transferred Molly from
the private room she moved into Wednesday back into intensive care after the
surgery Thursday.

"The doctor just wanted her in the unit because of the type of wound she has,"
Williams said. "She's not in any worse danger than she was. It's just strictly
for the wound care.

"She's recovering great, and they just want to keep that going," she said.

Molly was in a private room less than 24 hours. She could use her cell phone and
talk to friends more often, as well as receive more guests.

Despite the disappointment of moving out of the private room, Williams said her
niece maintained her positive attitude and was her "bubbly, happy self."

Molly has recovered at Huntsville Hospital for four weeks after a boating
accident on the Tennessee River. After she was ejected from the boat, the
outboard motor propeller nearly severed her left leg at the upper thigh.
Surgeons partially amputated her left leg a few inches above the knee two weeks
ago.

Williams said the skin grafts occurred on some of the closed wounds on her left
leg. Doctors told her spots where they remove the skin for the grafting would
feel like the worst "strawberry" she's ever had. She experienced some pain
Thursday after surgery and rested most of the day.

Friday, she felt much better and requested steak for lunch, Williams added.

Subsequent skin grafts will occur as her wounds heal, she said.

Molly's parents, Brian Moses and Polly Moses, attended the Friday night
Decatur-Austin football game, where they accepted a check from Chick-fil-A. The
restaurant donated $500, 10 percent of its revenue from Tuesday night.

The next big benefit for Molly will be at The Brick Deli on Sept. 17. It will
include a silent auction. Renasant and Peoples Bank continue to accept donations
to help the family pay for part of Molly's medical expenses.

Anyone who donates will receive a "Miracles for Molly" bracelet.

People can also buy the rubber bracelets at Custom Thunder Audio and Video on
Central Parkway and The French Connection on Sixth Avenue Southeast. They are $3
each.

Molly's status is updated on two Web sites: www.caring
bridge.org/visit/mollymoses and a Facebook page titled "Miracles for Molly."

Joe: the first transplant doctor . . . who was then accused of playing God

SECTION: OBITUARIES

LENGTH: 746 words


Joseph Murray, who has died aged 93, carried out the world's first successful
organ transplant, revolutionising the treatment of acute illness. His first
success in the field came in 1954, when he transplanted a kidney between
identical twins. Eight years later he performed the same feat between two
unrelated individuals   achievements for which he shared the Nobel Prize in
Physiology or Medicine with the bone marrow transplant pioneer Donnall Thomas in
1990.

Until 1954, attempts to transplant living tissue from one human being to another
had failed due to the rejection of the transplanted tissue by the recipients'
immune systems. Transplant operations generally ended up killing the
transplanted tissue, and often the patient.

Murray's interest in transplants developed during World War Two, when he was
assigned to Valley Forge General Hospital in Pennsylvania, which specialised in
performing reconstructive surgery.

One patient in particular intrigued him. Charles Woods was a 22-year-old pilot
who had been badly burnt in a crash, and needed 18 months of reconstructive
surgery and skin grafts.

To do this doctors had to relocate small patches of skin from Woods's own body
in each operation and use skin taken from dead bodies as temporary protection on
his open wounds.

Murray noticed that, instead of destroying these foreign grafts within the usual
eight to 10 days, Woods's immune system took a month. Studying his medical
records, he realised that Woods's weakened state had slowed his body's rejection
of the transplanted skin.

He found another clue when a surgeon who had performed skin grafts on civilians
before the war told him that he had noticed that the closer the donor and
recipient were related, the slower the tissue was rejected.

In 1937 a skin graft between identical twins had taken permanently. As Murray
later put it in his autobiography, 2001's Surgery of the Soul, "perhaps there
were tricks we could learn that would one day allow us to prevent the rejection
of transplanted organs" such as kidneys.

Yet most surgeons thought that organ transplants were a pipe dream.

After the war, Murray moved to Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston; he
pioneered new techniques involving the reconnection of nerves, tissues and blood
vessels and carried out successful kidney transplants on animals.

In December 1954 the opportunity to operate on a human patient presented itself
in Richard Herrick, a 23-year old dying of chronic nephritis, who had an
identical twin brother willing to donate a kidney.

Murray prepared thoroughly, even (in an age before DNA testing) having the
brothers fingerprinted by the Boston Police Department to ensure that they were
identical, not fraternal, twins.

He held meetings with doctors, religious leaders and lawyers to explore the
ethical issues involved in subjecting a healthy human being to potentially risky
surgery, and carried out a test transplant using dead bodies.

The operation, carried out on December 23, went without a hitch. Less than 90
minutes after one surgical team removed the donated kidney, Murray had connected
it to Richard Herrick's blood vessels.

As the new kidney turned a healthy pink, "there were grins all around" in the
operating room, Murray recalled. Richard Herrick lived for eight more years
until the kidney disease recurred.

Despite the success, Murray faced enormous problems. People accused him of
"playing God" and his breakthrough did not solve the problem of rejection in
patients without an identical twin.

It was the development of immunosuppressant drugs that made real progress
possible. In 1959 Murray heard about an experiment in which scientists had
injected an anti-cancer drug, Imuran, into dogs to trick their immune systems
into accepting a foreign protein while not preventing them from attacking other
germs, and he determined to try the drug.

By 1962, Murray had worked out the correct dosage and the fourth patient, a
23-year old accountant, survived after being given a kidney from an unrelated
donor with the same blood type, ushering in a new era in transplant surgery.

In 1971 Murray resigned as head of transplant surgery at Peter Bent Brigham
Hospital to concentrate on plastic surgery.

A devout Roman Catholic, Murray was a member of the Pontifical Academy of
Sciences, which advises the Vatican on scientific issues. In 1945 he married
Virginia Link, who survives him with their six children.

Joseph Murray, born April 1, 1919, died November 29, 2012.

Fetal Tests, Like Drugs, Need Cautious Screening;
Miracle Tissue

SECTION: Section A; Page 38, Column 5; Editorial Desk

LENGTH: 409 words


To the Editor:

''Life, Death and Fetal Tissue'' (editorial, Sept. 11) describes the moral
dilemma in the face of a growing clinical need. Human fetal tissue grafts for
the treatment of Parkinson's disease, other central nervous system disorders and
radiation injury are only the beginning of the potential clinical applications.

Fetal grafts from human embryonic sources constitute a major advance in handling
degenerative disorders, because of the long-term integrated survival of fetal
tissue in the host and its potential to resist rejection, compared with adult
tissue grafts.

Fetal grafts of pancreatic islet cells will eventually correct juvenile diabetes
(insulin-dependent diabetes) which involves some 2 million Americans totally
dependent on insulin, whose lives are often shortened by accelerated
atherosclerotic, renal and neurological disorders.

In the next decade, embryonic heart muscle could become a source for repairing
damaged hearts. Patching or splinting the damaged heart with fetal heart tissue
will maintain cardiac function because embryonic heart muscle cells have
regenerative and long-term functional capacity, compared with adult tissue.
Research in this area is feasible, morally acceptable and more sensible than our
emphasis on total heart transplantation or use of artificial hearts.

This new technology must solve the ethical and production problems of providing
large numbers of human embryonic cells. Massive tissue culture programs of
embryonic predifferentiated cells are necessary to avoid the nightmare of black
markets in the unborn. We must ask how to avoid the moral anesthesia that will
have some of us using the unborn for personal or commercial exploitation.

We should approach the problem as a coordinated national research priority to
understand why embryonic cells are different, how to transform adult cells to
embryonic type and how to obtain fetal tissue and grow it continuously with
minimal need to obtain human embryos repeatedly. The answers could also increase
understanding of the physiology of aging.

Unless we find a way to defuse the issue by growing embryonic cells in culture,
divorced in large measure from its embryonic source, we will face a crisis that
will further polarize our attitudes toward abortion and the growing needs of an
aging soci-ety.

Ovary transplants key to later motherhood

BYLINE: JENNY HOPE, LONDON

SECTION: OPINION; Pg. 23

LENGTH: 281  words


WOMEN could delay having babies and the menopause with an ovary transplant,
according to the surgeon who carried out the first such operation.

Similar techniques are used to save the ovaries of those being treated for
cancer. However, Dr Sherman Silber predicted that transplants or grafts for
social reasons were a realistic option for preserving fertility.

In 2007, the US microsurgeon transplanted an ovary from one twin to another who
had become infertile. The 38-year-old woman then was able to give birth the
following year.

The drugs used to treat cancer may destroy ovaries, so slices of tissue are
taken in advance and frozen.

They can be reimplanted when the woman is ready to start a family.

So far, 22 women have given birth after having their ovarian tissue restored.

Details were released at the annual meeting of the European Society of Human
Reproduction and Embryology in Istanbul.

Dr Silber, who practises at the Infertility Centre of Saint Louis, Missouri,
presented data on three women who had frozen and thawed ovary grafts and nine
who had fresh ovary grafts, usually donated by relatives.

One woman had ovarian tissue implanted to treat premature menopause caused by
cancer drugs and another had a graft to treat a naturally premature menopause.

Eight babies in total have been born to the women.

And, so far, one graft has lasted seven years. ``Transplanted ovarian tissue can
robustly restore menstrual cycles and fertility and may even in the future be
used to postpone the normal time of menopause or to alleviate its symptoms,'' Dr
Silber said.

Women going through a premature menopause in their 20s or 30s are offered
hormone replacement therapy to alleviate symptoms.

Franklin Fire Company firefighter undergoes skin grafts

BYLINE: By JIM TUTTLE Staff writer

SECTION: LOCAL

LENGTH: 492 words


CHAMBERSBURG -- One of the firefighters injured Saturday while battling a mobile
home fire in Hamilton Township reportedly had skin graft surgery Monday.

Assistant Chief Jason Kuehler remains in a critical care unit at Johns Hopkins
Burn Center at Bayview Medical Center in Baltimore, according to Deputy Chief
Jeremy Rebok, Franklin Fire Company.

"It's going to be a long haul for Jason," he said.

Kuehler suffered severe burns to 20 percent of his body. He is now listed in
stable condition. He was scheduled to undergo his first round of grafts Monday.
The number of procedures that will be necessary and the duration of his
hospitalization have not been determined.

Firefighter Nick Stefany was discharged Sunday from the Lehigh Valley Burn
Center in Allentown, Rebok said. Stefany reportedly suffered burns to his hands,
wrist and ear. He has an appointment for re-evaluation Thursday at Bayview.

"He's doing very well. He's got a lot of pain to the areas that were burned, but
he's in good spirits," Rebok said, adding that Stefany has already been to visit
Kuehler in Baltimore.

He wasn't alone. A convoy of vehicles brought about 20 firefighters to the burn
center Sunday. Meanwhile, firefighters have signed up to be at the hospital in
shifts, two people at a time for eight to 10 hours.

They plan to be there at least through Saturday to show their support and assist
the injured man's family around the clock, Rebok said. "It probably will
continue for quite some more time," he said.

The hospitalized firefighter has a wife and two young children, Rebok said.

Kuehler, Stefany and Josh Caratozzola were rushed to Chambersburg Hospital early
Saturday after they were injured inside the burning mobile home at 1449 Frank
Road. From there, Kuehler was flown to Baltimore and Stefany was driven to
Allentown. Caratozzola was treated and released.

Rebok said it is believed that a "flashover" inside the home may be responsible
for their injuries, but the incident is still under investigation, along with
the cause of the fire itself.

"We're just trying to take care of our issues at hand," he said. "We're just
trying to pull through this situation and make sure that the family's needs are
taken care of."

In a statement issued Saturday by Pennsylvania State Police, the destroyed
mobile home was identified as the residence of Richard Crider, 58.

Rebok said he was unaware of Crider's location, or whether any pets died in the
fire.

A call to Franklin Fire Company Chief Mark Trace was not returned Monday.

Efforts to reach Assistant Deputy Fire Marshal Trooper Franklin Hershey and Fire
Marshal Jeffrey Sarver were unsuccessful.

To donate

Anyone wishing to make a donation to the families of the injured firefighters
may send it to Franklin Fire Company, 158 W. King St., Chambersburg 17201.
Donations should be directed to company President Jim Hull or Fire Chief Mark
Trace.

Multi-Centre Early Experience, Data Presented on Lombard Medical's Altura
Endovascular Stent Graft at 43rd Annual VEITHsymposium

LENGTH: 508  words


Nov. 21 -- Lombard Medical, Inc. (NASDAQ:EVAR), a medical device company focused
on endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs),
today announced that its Altura endovascular stent graft system was featured in
a scientific presentation at the 43rd annual VEITHsymposium in New York City on
November 17, 2016. The Altura stent graft, which was launched commercially in
Europe earlier in 2016, is specifically designed to simplify treatment in
patients with normal AAA anatomy.

The Altura stent graft was featured in a scientific presentation by Mr. David
Murray, Consultant Vascular Surgeon at Manchester Royal Infirmary, Manchester,
UK, titled, "Advantages and Limitations of Lombard's Altura Endograft Device to
Simplify EVAR Procedures: A Multicenter Study."

The data showed a total of 24 patients were treated electively between April and
October 2016. Sixteen patients were male, with a mean age of 75. Median AAA
diameter was 60mm (52-105mm), median neck length was 23mm (15-60mm), median
proximal neck diameter was 23mm (19-26mm), median  neck angulation was 31.
Median iliac landing zone diameter was 14mm (9-18mm). Access was percutaneous in
25 of 38 groins.

* 18 (75%) of patients were discharged at or before 24 hours (Day-Case EVAR).

* There were no deaths within 90 days.

* There were no immediate or delayed access-related complications.

Screening times and radiation doses were low and show a reduction over time and
experience with the device:

* Deployment time ranged 19-45 minutes.

* Mean contrast dose was 150ml.

* Median intraoperative contrast dose was 75ml of 50% concentrate Visipaque 270.

* A further 60ml for rotational angiography at completion in the hybrid lab.

Technical success was 100% with freedom from type I/III endoleaks at 100% with
stable aneurysm size and no evidence of stent-graft migration.

Mr. Murray commented, "The significance of the low contrast doses, low screen
and procedure times and radiation dose reduction, already demonstrates some of
the key benefits the new Altura system offers, even taking into account that
this data includes the learning curve across two units. It has the potential to
be a game-changer for EVAR as we have already been able to perform two-thirds of
our Altura cases as 'day-case' procedures."

Mr. Steve Richardson, Consultant Vascular Surgeon at University Hospital South
Manchester (UHSM), UK, added, "We are extremely pleased with our early
experience using Altura, the learning curve is rapid and it has quickly become
the 'go to' endograft in our vascular unit."

Lombard Medical CEO Simon Hubbert commented, "Altura clearly offers unique
benefits to physicians and patients and significantly enhances the treatment of
patients with standard AAA anatomy. Its unique features including an ultra-low
profile 14F delivery system, the elimination of the unpredictable procedure step
of 'stent graft gate cannulation' and retrograde iliac deployment all add up to
a simpler, quicker, predictable and safer procedure with optimum outcomes."

Deals roundup

St. Jude adds Savacor for $50M; Angiotech closes Lifespan buy

By DON LONG Medical Device Daily Managing Editor   St. Jude Medical (St. Paul,
Minnesota) yesterday unveiled plans to acquire Savacor (Los Angeles), a
developer of technology for managing congestive heart failure (CHF), in a deal
valued at $50 million.

St. Jude said the deal also involved payment of regulatory and sales milestones,
but details concerning these were not disclosed. The company said it would
record a $50 million in-process R&D charge in connection with the transaction.

Launched in late 2000, Savacor is a developer of heart failure diagnostic and
therapy guidance products and technologies currently in clinical evaluation. Its
activities are based on the premise that fixed-dose therapies do not adjust well
for changing conditions of CHF and that an implanted sensor can provide
continuing assessment for better management.

The implantable sensor device developed by Savacor, dubbed the HeartPOD Heart
Failure Therapy System, (POD standing for physiologically optimized dosimeter)
measures left atrial pressure (LAP) and body temperature enabling real-time
adjustments in therapy. An increase in LAP works to force water into the lungs,
creating the pulmonary congestion that gives CHF its name, and it is estimated
that pulmonary congestion produces about 90% of CHF-related hospitalizations.

Savacor in June launched the HemOdynaMically guidEd hOme Self-Therapy in Severe
heart failure patientS (HOMEOSTASIS I) clinical trial of the sensor, a
first-in-man feasibility trial in 20 patients with CHF, at up to four
international sites. The first five patients were implanted at Christchurch
Hospital (Christchurch, New Zealand).

The company's device targets CHF therapy in much the same way as daily glucose
monitoring is used to manage diabetes, and aids in therapeutic self-management.
Success of the device is seen in symptom improvement and fewer hospitalizations.

The American Heart Association (Dallas) estimates there are nearly 5 million
Americans with heart failure, with about 22 million sufferers worldwide. Costs
of CHF to the U.S. healthcare system have been estimated at more than $40
billion.

Michael Coyle, president of St. Jude Medical's Cardiac Rhythm Management
business, said that Savacor's sensor device "will complement the development
efforts already under way at St. Jude Medical in managing the co-morbidities of
heart failure patients."

Savacor in late 2002 raised a Series B round of financing of $3 million.

St. Jude said the acquisition is expected to close by year-end.

Angiotech Pharmaceuticals (Vancouver, British Columbia) reported that it has
completed its acquisition of Edwards Lifesciences' (Irvine, California) Lifespan
ePTFE vascular graft business, located in Laguna Hills, California, for $14
million in cash.

The deal was first disclosed early last month.

The transaction includes a distribution agreement with Edwards, whereby Edwards
will continue to sell the existing Lifespan product line for up to five years
and will be the exclusive distributor of Angiotech's Vascular Wrap
paclitaxel-eluting mesh product, packaged in combination with Lifespan vascular
grafts, in the European Union for up to two years from the receipt of European
regulatory approval of Vascular Wrap.

Angiotech retains all distribution rights with respect to any and all Vascular
Wrap paclitaxel-eluting mesh related products in the U.S. and has co-exclusive
distribution rights with respect to the standalone Lifespan product line in the
U.S.

Along with the presentation of positive safety data at the 32nd annual
VEITHsymposium in New York last month, Angiotech reported plans to initiate the
Paclitaxel Releasing Extra-Vascular Anastamosis Implant & Lifespan Graft
(PREVAIL) trial in the first half of 2006. PREVAIL will assess the efficacy of
the Vascular Wrap product implanted in combination with Lifespan grafts for
hemodialysis patients with renal disease who receive arteriovenous (AV) access
implants.

Of about 4.4 million people in the U.S. with end-stage renal disease, 250,000
undergo hemodialysis and roughly half of these have synthetic grafts that
produce scar formations that reduce graft patency. Only 50% remain open at one
year, and only 25% are still open at two years. AV-access failure is responsible
for 20% of all hospitalizations of patients with end-stage renal disease in the
U.S., and the morbidity costs has been estimated at $1 billion annually.

The Vascular Wrap product incorporates Angiotech's paclitaxel technology used in
the Taxus paclitaxel-eluting coronary stent from Boston Scientific (Natick,
Massachusetts).

In other dealmaking activity:

o Agilent Technologies (Palo Alto, California) reported completing the
divestiture of its Semiconductor Products business to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &
Co. and Silver Lake Partners for $2.66 billion, subject to various
closing-related adjustments.

The divestiture is one in a series of actions Agilent unveiled on Aug. 15,
designed to enhance the company's focus as a pure-play measurement company. The
divestiture includes 6,500 employees and operations in Asia, the U.S. and
Europe.

Agilent describes itself as a technology leader in communications, electronics,
life sciences and chemical analysis.

o Renal Care Group (Nashville, Tennessee) reported that Florence Acquisition, an
indirect subsidiary of Fres-enius Medical Care (Bad Homburg, Germany), has
commenced an offer to purchase for cash any and all of the $159,685,000 in
outstanding principal amount of 9% senior subordinated notes, due 2011, of Renal
Care Group. The offer is being made in connection with the acquisition of Renal
Care Group and its subsidiaries by Fresenius. The deal was first unveiled in
May.

The consent solicitation expires at 5 p.m., EST, Dec. 13, unless extended by
Florence. The tender offer will expire at 5 p.m., EST, on Dec. 29, unless
extended.

The total to be paid for validly tendered notes will be the present value of
future cash flows up to and including Nov. 1, 2007, based on the assumption that
the notes will be redeemed at a price of $1,045 per $1,000 principal amount of
notes on such date, discounted at a rate equal to 50 basis points over the yield
to maturity on the 4.25% U.S. Treasury notes, due Oct. 31, 2007.

o HCA (Nashville, Tennessee) reported completing the sale of five rural
hospitals to Capella Healthcare (also Nashville) for around $260 million.

The facilities include Grandview Medical Center (Jasper, Tennessee); River Park
Hospital (McMinnville, Tennessee); Southwestern Medical Center (Lawton,
Oklahoma) and Capital Medical Center (Olympia, Washington). Sale of the fifth
hospital, North Monroe Medical Center (Monroe, Louisiana), was completed on Oct.
31.

The facilities are part of a divestiture of hospitals by HCA, primarily in rural
and non urban markets. The company's remaining hospitals are primarily in larger
urban and suburban areas.

o Health Management Associates (Naples, Florida) reported completing the
acquisition of Gilmore Memorial Hospital (Amory, Mississippi), a general
acute-care hospital with 95 licensed beds, generating about $40 million in
annual revenue. Terms were not disclosed. HMA said it plans to acquire five to
seven more hospitals in FY06.

HMA is the premier operator of non-urban general acute care hospitals in
communities situated throughout the U.S.

LENGTH: 272 words

DATELINE: U.S.


U.S., Aug. 21 -- CE Mark has been achieved by W. L. Gore & Associates GORE
Hybrid Vascular Graft, which is prepared to develop treatment options for best
outflow by maximizing the number of access sites available.

The newly created access implants showed a new development towards enhancement
in functional graft patency and reduction in seroma than historical graft data.

The GORE Hybrid Vascular Graft got FDA approval in 2010 and is indicated for use
as a vascular prosthesis for substitute or bypass of diseased vessels affected
by aortic aneurysmal, peripheral vascular and end stage renal disease.

The device is created to prevent the most common causes of graft failure;
intimal hyperplasia, thrombosis and seroma. It eases access to vessels with a
possible over the wire deployment method that decreases vessel injury and
dissection.

The GORE Hybrid Vascular Graft comprises certain reliable Gore technologies and
the prolonged polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) vascular prosthesis has a
reinforced section with nitinol. The nitinol reinforced is partly forced to
permit easy insertion and deployment into vessels that are tough to get to.

W. L. Gore & Associates Inc. is an American manufacturing company specializing
in products derived from fluoropolymers. It is a privately held corporation
headquartered in Newark, Delaware. It is best known as the developer of
waterproof, breathable Gore-Tex fabrics.

Kensey Nash files for FDA approval of TriActiv device

Kensey Nash files for FDA approval of TriActiv device

By HOLLAND JOHNSON  Medical Device Daily Associate Managing Editor  Kensey Nash
(Exton, Pennsylvania), another company vying to enter the distal protection
market in the U.S., said it has submitted an application for 510(k) clearance
for its TriActiv System to the FDA.

The TriActiv, formerly called the Aegis Vortex System, is a protection system
designed to prevent material or debris, dislodged during stent procedures, from
embolizing downstream and causing adverse coronary events such as a heart
attack. This is accomplished with three integrated system features: an embolic
protection balloon, and a combined active flush and extraction system to remove
the problematic debris from the target vessel.

The current market for these types of embolic protection systems, the company
said, is estimated at $100 million worldwide and is expected to grow
substantially over the next several years as next-generation products are
developed and indications are expanded.

The application for 510(k) clearance contained data from the company's PRIDE
(PRotection during saphenous vein graft Intervention to prevent Distal
Embolization) trial which compared the TriActiv device against other approved
embolic protection systems for the treatment of saphenous vein graft disease.

The "other" systems include Medtronic's (Minneapolis, Minnesota) PercuSurge
GuardWire Plus System and Boston Scientific's (Natick, Massachusetts) FilterWire
EX Embolic Protection system, both approved in the U.S. for use in saphenous
vein grafts that have become occluded after coronary artery bypass graft
surgery.

The PercuSurge system was first to U.S. market, receiving its approval in June
2001, while Boston Sci's FilterWire system earned its clearance last June.

The FDA grants 510(k) clearance, which allows marketing of a device in the U.S.,
when it determines that a new device is substantially equivalent to an approved
device. The PRIDE study enrolled 894 patients at 68 sites in the U.S. and 10
sites in Europe.

"I am pleased to announce that the PRIDE trial achieved its objective of showing
non-inferiority of the TriActiv System to approved devices, as measured by the
primary endpoint of 30-day major adverse cardiac events (MACE) rates," said
Joseph Carrozza, MD, chief of the interventional cardiologysection at Beth
Israel Deaconess Medical Center (Boston, Massachusetts) and principal
investigator for the trial. "The unique attributes of the TriActiv System,
especially its flush and extraction systems, will be important tools for the
interventional cardiologist in treating their patients with saphenous vein graft
disease," he said. "We will look forward to having this device on the market."

A Kensey Nash spokesperson told MDD that, as the name implies, the TriActiv "is
basically three tools in one device." The spokesperson noted that aside from the
distal protection balloon, the device's flushing system and automated extraction
system help to differentiate the system from the competition. The PercuSurge,
the spokesperson noted, has a manual extraction system vs. Kensey Nash's
automated system, and the TriActiv is the only device with a flushing system.
The FliterWire system is different from the other two devices in that it
incorporates a filter rather than a balloon-based occlusion system.

Data from the PRIDE trial will be presented at a late-breaking trials session of
the Transcatheter Therapeutics Conference to be held in Washington in September.

"The submission of the 510(k) represents a major milestone on the road to
commercialization of a new technology platform for Kensey Nash," said Joseph
Kaufmann, president and chief executive officer of Kensey Nash. "Our company,
since our founding 20 years ago this summer, has been dedicated to bringing
innovative technologies that provide important benefits to physicians and
patients to the market. The TriActiv System platform continues this tradition by
providing a novel and comprehensive approach to the significant issues of debris
embolization. With all of the planned future generations of our TriActiv System,
we are looking forward to reporting many more milestones in the coming months
and years."

The TriActiv System is currently approved for sale for the saphenous vein graft
indication in the European Union. The company said it is selling direct to
customers in Germany and through distributors in other countries in Europe.

Ultimately, the spokesperson said, these distal protection systems could be
developed to address all vessels where embolic protection is important for
patient safety. The market for these devices may be expanded significantly with
additional indications for use in carotid artery stenting, acute myocardial
infarction (AMI) and other peripheral vascular applications, the spokesperson
said .

At this time, neither the Medtronic nor Boston Scientific devices are eligible
for reimbursement in the U.S.; the cost is basically rolled into the money that
would be coming in for the CABG procedure.

o Bruker (Billerica, Massachusetts) reported the release of the Innova-IRIS, an
integrated system for correlated atomic force microscopy and Raman spectroscopic
imaging. Bruker claims its combination of ultra-low closed loop noise, no-drift
mechanical stability, and wide-open optical access make the Innova AFM a
uniquely suitable platform for challenging Tip-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy
(TERS) research. With hardware integration specifically designed to accelerate a
TERS setup, and an IRIS software module that offers automated mapping, the
system transforms today's leading AFM and Raman instruments into a proven
TERS-enabled research platform. The Innova-IRIS model leverages the AFM head
design of the Innova platform to provide TERS-ready AFM-Raman integration
suitable for the sensitive interrogation of opaque samples. It is compatible
with Raman systems and implements the optimized off-axis Raman geometry
necessary for maximum sensitivity.

o Covidien (Mansfield, Massachusetts) reported study data demonstrating that use
of its Endo Stitch automated suturing device lowers mean hospital costs and
operating room (OR) time during total laparoscopic hysterectomies treating
benign conditions. Using the Endo Stitch device in such procedures was
associated with lowering overall hospitalization costs by almost $1,800 and
reducing OR time by about 40 minutes, on average, when compared to those same
procedures performed with robotic assistance. The study was a retrospective data
analysis that compared the reported overall hospital costs and OR time when
using the Endo Stitch device, vs. using robotic techniques, during total
laparoscopic hysterectomy in benign cases, as well as using neither the Endo
Stitch device nor robotic techniques in such cases.

o W. L. Gore (Flagstaff, Arizona) has received FDA approval for the 23 mm and 27
mm diameter sizes of the contralateral leg component of the Gore Excluder AAA
Endoprosthesis for treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The new
diameter devices provide physicians with the ability to repair AAAs in a wider
range of anatomies eligible for minimally invasive endovascular AAA repair. The
Gore Excluder AAA Endoprosthesis is an endovascular stent-graft that seals off
the aneurysm and creates a new path for blood flow. The device is inserted
through a small incision in the patient's leg using a catheter-based delivery
technique. Once the physician has positioned the graft in the diseased aorta,
the Gore C3 Delivery system enables repositioning of the stent-graft. The
ability to reposition the device may minimize complications that could occur if
the graft needs to be moved after the initial deployment.

Havertys reinstates quarterly dividend

The Atlanta furniture company Havertys has reinstated a quarterly dividend it
suspended in 2008 because of the recession.

While the company continued to pay an annual dividend, it suspended the
quarterly dividend in November 2008 due to the "severe financial economic
downturn," president and CEO Clarence Smith said in a statement. The company had
paid a quarterly dividend since 1935.

The move to reinstate it, Smith said, "is an important sign of our strong
balance sheet, operational progress and our confidence in the future."

The company will pay shareholders 4 cents per share.

Earlier this month, Havertys reported that it made $2.5 million for the first
three months of the year, after losing $671,000 in the first quarter of 2011.
Sales were up 6.1 percent for the quarter. ARIELLE KASS

Georgia Power bills will fall about $8 a month

Georgia Power customers will see an average $8 drop in their monthly bills
starting June 1.

State utility regulators approved the average 6 percent decrease at a meeting
Tuesday.

The reduction is based on a lower amount that Georgia Power said it needs to buy
fuel --- natural gas, coal and nuclear power and renewable energy --- to make
electricity. The utility said in March it was reducing fuel charges on customer
bills by $567 million a year over the next two years.

The Georgia Public Service Commission is scheduled to hold hearings on the
proposed fuel decrease in June. Utility regulator Chuck Eaton asked that the PSC
approve the rates as filed so Georgia Power can begin lowering bills in June, a
month earlier than scheduled. If charges need to be adjusted, that modification
can be made after the hearings.

Georgia Power is allowed to recoup the cost of fuel from its customers, but the
utility cannot profit from those costs. KRISTI E. SWARTZ

CryoLife to pay $17M for Hemosphere

Medical device maker CryoLife Inc. said Tuesday that it has agreed to buy
Hemosphere Inc., which makes a vascular graft that is used in kidney dialysis
patients, for $17 million in cash.

CryoLife, which is based in Kennesaw, said it could pay another $4.5 million
based on sales of Hemosphere's HeRO graft.

The HeRO graft is used in patients with end-stage kidney disease who are on
dialysis and have blocked central veins. The graft bypasses central veins to get
blood to flow from a target artery to the heart. The HeRO graft was approved in
the U.S. in 2008 and Europe in 2011.

CryoLife said Hemosphere, which is based in Eden Prairie, Minn., near
Minneapolis, had $5.3 million in revenue in 2011. It expects to complete the
purchase in May. ASSOCIATED PRESS

center within the National Health System servicing more than 180 EVAR patients
annually.

"Endovascular aortic repair is the standard of care for patients requiring
intervention for abdominal aortic aneurysm. The new Altura stent graft from
Lombard significantly simplifies what can be a complex procedure while offering
increased accuracy and control in stent graft deployment," said Jonathan Ghosh,
Consultant Vascular and Endovascular Surgeon at UHSM.

"We are now able to perform same day aortic aneurysm repair and the new Altura
device should benefit both the patient and hospital with its 14F ultra low
profile design, predictable procedure times and greatly reduced inventory
requirements," added Dr. Dare Sereki, Consultant Vascular Interventional
Radiologist at UHSM.

"Our first commercial procedure is an important step in executing our Altura
commercial strategy.  We'd like to thank Mr. Ghosh, Dr Sereki and University
Hospital of South Manchester for this opportunity," said Lombard CEO Simon
Hubbert.  "With the official launch last week at the Leipzig Interventional
Course (LINC), we are looking to build on the physician interest and excitement
surrounding Altura and expand our launch in the UK and German markets."

Studies use DNA to grow blood vessels, treat vein grafts

BYLINE: Steve Sternberg

SECTION: LIFE; Pg. 10D

LENGTH: 460 words


Among the studies on gene therapy for heart disease reported at
last month's American Heart Association meeting and satellite
sessions in Dallas:

* Jeffrey Isner and colleagues at St. Elizabeth's Medical
Center in Boston injected "naked DNA" -- genes for vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that haven't been inserted into
a carrier cell -- into people with blood vessel disease. They
have tried the procedure in about 90 people with blocked leg veins
and 16 with blocked coronary arteries.

Six of the 11 heart patients followed for at least three months
no longer suffer chest pain. The use of nitroglycerin tablets
to ease pain plummeted from an average of 60 per week to 2.5.
Isner's group is working with Human Genome Sciences of Rockville,
Md., to bring the method to market.

* Ronald Crystal and colleagues at New York Hospital-Cornell
Medical Center injected more than 20 heart disease patients with
VEGF genes enclosed in a cold virus that was weakened so it wouldn't
cause illness. The treatment was tolerated well, and the patients
reported feeling better. They also performed better on treadmill
tests, says Crystal, whose work is supported by GenVac of Rockville,
Md., and Warner Lambert of Morris Plains, N.J.

* Michael Mann and colleagues of Brigham and Women's Hospital
at Harvard University in Boston have done 17 bypasses of leg arteries
using veins treated after their removal with genes that halt the
changes that lead to graft failure. Five of the 17 vein grafts
failed, compared with 10 of 16 untreated grafts. While Mann was
meeting with reporters at the AHA meeting, his colleague Victor
Dzau hurried off to meet with representatives of a surgical device
company eager to commercialize the method.

* Seppo Yla-Herttuala of the University of Kuopio in Finland
reported favorable results in a trial of 15 patients, 10 of whom
were given a fragment of the gene for VEGF. Five served as controls.

* Kirk Hammond and his colleagues at Collateral Therapeutics
in San Diego are about to start a 100-patient trial of the gene
for a different substance, fibroblast growth factor, encased in
a weakened cold virus, to see whether it also can improve blood
flow to the heart. They deliver the gene to the heart through
a catheter to eliminate surgery.

* Ted McClusky of Genentech in South San Francisco says
a clinical trial of VEGF protein -- not the gene but the protein
the gene makes -- produced new blood vessels in 10 of 26 people.
Four of the 26 had fewer vessels, an indication that the therapy
didn't take and the obstruction had worsened. Twelve were unchanged.
The study was designed only to determine the best dose of the
protein, not to test its effectiveness.

Local songwriter reaches out with music

BYLINE: Joseph Ryan, Daily Herald Staff Writer

SECTION: NEIGHBOR; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 557 words


As Maria Graft listened to the powerful music of internationally famous Darlene
Zschech at a religious concert in Wheaton seven years ago, her life began to
change.

"I was crying. It was very moving, very powerful," the Inverness resident and
former school teacher said. "It really felt like God was saying 'This is where
you need to be."

That year, Graft started to become more enthusiastic about her religion, and she
also kick-started her musical talents that had remained largely dormant since
high school.

The energy Zschech seemed to pass to Graft later powered her to create her first
official recording, a collection of lullabies to her three children.

Three years after her first release, Graft is making public her most recent
attempt at spreading spirituality.

With 10 self-written songs of hope and rebirth, Graft hopes to do for others
what Zschech did for her. Most importantly, she wants to reach out to those most
down - jailed youth.

The road to prison is not very easy for those like Graft.

"It is very hard to get into prison. It is very hard to say 'I want to do
something good for these people here," she said.

In December while working with area ministries, Graft landed a single gig at a
teen prison attached to the Robert Ellsworth Correctional Center, a facility for
female prisoners in Racine, Wis..

"That was so affirming to me, singing for those teens," she said. "Immediately
when I would stop singing they would still be singing the chorus. Later, some
said, 'I know I totally have gone down the wrong path.' That to me is the
payoff."

When her latest CD, "Running Home," was produced, she sent 70 copies to those
teens.

"They kept saying I would forget about them," Graft said.

Graft wants to keep working the prison circuit, though she said it is hard to
gain the trust of correctional facility authorities.

At the same time, Graft also plans to continue touring local churches and other
venues, such as malls. Most of all, she wants to reach out to those who are not
likely to hear the fast-paced, multi-instrument, spiritual music she produces.

"My goal is really to spread the gospel, to spread the good word of Jesus," she
said.

But Graft wasn't always so charged by religion.

"I wasn't necessarily a good girl," she said. "I went to church every week but I
don't think any of the religious rituals meant much to me. I didn't have a full
understanding of that. All of this was a growing experience.

"I know there are people sitting in church who have gone every week of their
lives and it is not meaningful to them," she said.

Yet since Zschech's concert for the Wheaton congregation of Willow Creek Church,
Graft, a pianist, has been singing with spirit across the area.

She made an appearance on the "Intermissions" CD by the Dameans in 1997. She was
the opening act for Avalon at Holy Family Outdoor Fest in 2001.

She also performed two concert tours with fellow religious artist John Angotti.
One tour was in Chicago, and the other in Milwaukee. For her latest CD, Graft
teamed with popular Christian rock producer Morgan Cryar and Premier Records.

Despite the substantial money she had to put down for the new recording, Graft
said she is not out to make a buck.

"Every person you talk to, every person you encounter, you affect them," Graft
said. "Whether they are Christian or not, I feel in some way I will affect
them."

Sea coral grafts can replace bone in facial operations, surgeon   says

BYLINE: LAWRENCE SURTEES; GAM

LENGTH: 558 words


BY  LAWRENCE SURTEES
 The Globe and Mail
  A U.S. plastic surgeon has found that sea coral is an ideal replacement
for human facial bone.

Dr. Harvey Rosen, a professor of plastic surgery at the University of
Pennsylvania School of Medicine in Philadelphia, told reporters at a
briefing in Toronto yesterday that he has used coral grafts on 46 patients
with only two complications, both arising from surgical technique.

Dr. Rosen presented a study on the grafts at the annual meeting of the
American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons . More than 4,000
doctors are attending the week-long conference in Toronto.

"Our evidence indicates that this type of sea coral is very similar to
human bone, both in terms of its mineral content and its porous nature,"
Dr. Rosen said. "It also results in fewer surgical complications than
using a patient's own bone grafts."

The coral is harvested by divers in the South Pacific and then
chemically treated by a company in Irvine, Calif.

While the form of coral used is chemically similar to human bone, it
must be treated with heat and pressure to convert its outer layer of
calcium carbonate into calcium phosphate.

The real secret lies in the coral's pores. "They are the exact size and
distribution as human bone, which is why we can use it. And we have turned
to nature for a substitute because we cannot duplicate these pores in
synthetic materials," Dr. Rosen said.

The coral cannot be used in bone grafting everywhere in the body, such
as in the arms or legs, because it is not strong enough.

"Its prime surgical use is limited to the face, because facial bones
are about one-quarter the strength of bones in the rest of the body," Dr.
Rosen said. The sea coral is stronger than required for the face, despite
its brittleness.

Dr. Rosen is a cranio-facial surgeon, which means he is a
reconstructive plastic surgeon whose specialty is limited to the head and
face.

He has been using coral in operations to reconstruct the bones of the
lower face since May of 1986, when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
gave approval for it to be used experimentally.

"In the operations where it can be used, I no longer use anything
else," he said.

The coral implant is used in numerous surgical procedures to correct a
variety of facial deformities, including cleft palate. Most congenital
abnormalities of the face involve a bone or set of bones that have either
developed abnormally or are developing at a slower rate than another
facial bone. Many cranio-facial operations use bone implants to correct
the abnormality.

"The coral has to be surrounded by enough soft tissue, which is why it
is not very useful in the upper face (above the eyes)," Dr. Rosen said.

He said using coral means less pain, healing time and risk than taking
bone from elsewhere in the patient's body.

In his study, which began 27 months ago, only two patients had
complications arising from the surgical procedure used; none developed
infections or other complications associated with bone grafts.

Rejection is not a problem because the coral is chemically identical to
human bone. And after several months, the implant becomes stronger because
human bone grows into the coral's pores.

"Healing is actually speeded up," Dr. Rosen said, "because live human
bone grafts must be reabsorbed by the body before the new bone grows in.
With coral, new bone growth begins right away."

Doctors set to unbandage cultivated skin

BYLINE: Boitumelo Ntsoko

SECTION: HEALTH

LENGTH: 342 words


THREE-YEAR-OLD Pippie Kruger could have most of her bandages removed today after
her massive skin graft operation last week.
 Pippie's doctor, Ridwan Mia, said yesterday he would start removing her
bandages today, with the hope of having most of them removed by the end of the
week.


 "We will remove certain clips where the graft is very stable. This will
continue for a period of two to four days. A lot of the clips will be removed
today, but we will keep those where the graft is not as stable," he said.
 "From there we will expose a part of her body each day, to see how her wounds
are and put lighter dressings on."
 Pippie, from Lephalale in Limpopo, was severely burnt on New Year's Eve last
year, when a gel fire lighter used by her father, Erwin, exploded, causing burns
on 80% of her body. Doctors gave her only a 10% chance of survival.
 Mia and his team, however, took healthy skin from her groin area, from which
new skin was cultivated in a laboratory in Boston, US.
 The transplants were done on Monday last week, and today will be the first time
that Mia will see whether or not the operation worked.
 "It is very easy to be complacent at this stage, but we have to be vigilant and
make sure the graft is looked after and nurtured," he said.
 The procedure was a very delicate one, he said. "We have to remove the bandages
in a sterile environment, without disturbing the skin. You can't move
aggressively or fast, or slide the dressings as this could fracture or break the
graft."
 Mia said he did not expect to see Pippie's body covered with normal skin yet,
but was hoping the bright red wounds would be covered in a protective layer.

 Pippie's mother, Anice Kruger, said she could not wait for the bandages to come
off.
 "It [will be] like Christmas when the bandages come off, but they will have to
go back on again," Kruger said.
 Kruger said she was not sure what to expect today. "You know, I just want to
hold her again."
 She said the accident had been a long, hard road for the family, but it had
definitely brought them closer together.

Array of new cardio-imaging products rolled out by Philips

A Medical Device Daily Staff Report  In keeping with its status as a medical
imaging titan, the Philips Medical Systems (Andover, Massachusetts) subsidiary
of Royal Philips Electronics showcased a broad array of products at this week's
annual meeting of the American Heart Association (Dallas), just completed at the
Ernest N. Morial Convention Center in New Orleans.

Chief among this spectrum of new offerings were Philips' iE33 intelligent
echocardiography system; the Allura FD20 flat detector X-ray system; and the
Allura 3D Coronary Angiography heart imaging tool, the latter recently receiving
market clearance. John Steidley, PhD, vice president diagnostic imaging for
Philips Medical, said that the products exhibited fulfill the company's new
brand promise, "Sense and Simplicity," based on the fact that "they are advanced
technologies that are designed around what physicians and patients want and need
to make their lives easier."

Philips called the iE33 "the first premium echocardiography system to have fully
integrated 3-D cardiac quantification software [QLAB 3DQ] for measurement of the
left ventricle volume and ejection fraction."

Previously, doctors had to estimate the calculation of ejection fraction. "Now,
QLAB eliminates the guesswork and provides a consistent and accurate
measurement," Philips said. The system "can also analyze wall motion in 17
different segments of the heart simultaneously."

The company said that the Allura Xper FD20 and the Allura 3D-CA both provide
"unparalleled detailed representation of the condition of the heart's coronary
vessels."

Allura Xper FD20 captures and processes information at a resolution up to four
times greater than conventional systems. Allura 3D-CA (Coronary Angiography)
software/tool produces multiple viewpoints and angles enabling enable clinicians
to make faster decisions, based on "more confident diagnoses," according to the
company. Allura 3D-CA received clearance to market in late September.

Among some of the final clinical reports from the AHA meeting:

·Cambridge Heart (Bedford, Massachusetts) presented data supporting its
Microvolt T-Wave Alternans (TWA) test - which measures extremely subtle
beat-to-beat fluctuations in heartbeat - in a non-ischemic study population,
complementing, it said, results of a study among ischemic patients published
last month in Circulation. Both studies support TWA testing in identifying those
heart patients who are at "negligible risk" of sudden death and may therefore be
able to avoid implantable cardioverter defibrillator implantation.

Emerging from a multi-center, 549-patient trial partially funded by the National
Institutes of Health, 282 patients had non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and were
followed for a mean of 20 months in order to evaluate the prognostic
significance of the test. Of these, 34% had a normal (negative) test; 66% had an
abnormal test. Over the course of the study, 22 patients experienced the primary
endpoint: 16 deaths and 6 episodes of non-fatal sustained ventricular
arrhythmia. All of these 22 patients had an abnormal TWA test. None with a
normal TWA test died or experienced a non-fatal-sustained arrhythmia.

·Kensey Nash (Exton, Pennsylvania) presented results from preclinical research
on use of synthetic vascular grafts as an alternative to harvesting a patient's
own vessels for coronary artery and below-the-knee bypass procedures. The study
was designed to evaluate the in vivo performance of the bypass graft in a 30-day
simulated clinical model prior to a similar, longer-term trial. The graft - a
composite of several biomaterials and biological agents - demonstrated
biocompatibility and resisted formation of clots, Kensey Nash said. It remained
patent throughout observation and was shown to be capable of providing a conduit
for blood flow in diameters consistent with coronary and peripheral arterial
applications.

"This new graft has the potential to revolutionize cardiac surgery," said Ralph
Damiano, MD, chief of cardiac surgery at Washington University School of
Medicine (St. Louis). "A synthetic small-diameter graft with excellent patency
would eliminate the need to take grafts from the arm, leg or chest of the
patient. This would not only decrease surgical trauma, but would significantly
enable minimally invasive bypass surgery," he concluded.

Based on the initial results, Kensey Nash said it has commenced an investigation
to determine the effectiveness of the graft during a chronic long-term
implantation period.  The studies to date have been supported in part by a $1.9
million award by the Advanced Technology Program of the National Institute of
Standards and Technology.

Kensey Nash manufactures biomaterial-based products for the cardiology,
orthopedics, spine, drug and biologics, periodontal/dental, surgical and wound
care markets.

·LipoScience (Raleigh, North Carolina) reported the results of a study
confirming that the number of LDL particles (LDL-P) measured by nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) spectroscopy provides better prediction of heart disease risk
than levels of LDL cholesterol (LDL-C).

LipoScience develops clinical applications of NMR spectroscopy in the areas of
cardiovascular disease and metabolic disorders. Its flagship product, the NMR
LipoProfile blood test, was introduced for clinical research in 1997 and for use
in patient care in 1999.

LDL particles are the spherical "containers" that transport cholesterol
throughout the body. Excessive numbers of these particles enter at the artery
wall to cause atherosclerosis, which can lead to heart attack and stroke. Ernst
Schaefer, MD, and co-investigators from the Framingham Heart (Framingham,
Massachusetts) Offspring Study, said LDL-P was shown to provide significantly
more information about cardiovascular risk in middle-aged men and women followed
prospectively over eight years than traditional cholesterol measures.

The risk associated with elevated LDL-P was independent not only of LDL and HDL
cholesterol, but also of non-lipid risk factors such as age, high blood
pressure, diabetes and smoking.

The study involved the analysis of frozen blood samples obtained from 1,529 men
and 1,708 women who were followed for an average period of eight years to
monitor the development of cardiovascular disease, defined as fatal and
non-fatal myocardial infarction and stroke, claudication and angina. Two hundred
twenty men and 116 women developed CVD during the follow-up period. Statistical
analysis showed that levels of LDL-P and the small LDL particle subclass were
significantly more predictive of CVD events than LDL-C or the large LDL particle
subclass, after taking into account the risk contributed by established
non-lipid risk factors.

Among the patients expected to benefit from LDL particle testing are those with
pre-existing heart disease, diabetes or a family history of heart disease.
Patients with elevated triglycerides and other characteristics of the metabolic
syndrome also are likely to have higher LDL-P levels than indicated by LDL-C
testing, Schaefer said.

Medtronic: FDA Approves Medtronic Stent Graft for Aortic Transection Repair

LENGTH: 626  words


New Delhi, Nov. 13 -- Consistent with its commitment to clinical excellence,
Medtronic, Inc. (NYSE: MDT) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) has approved the company's Valiant Captivia stent graft
system for the endovascular repair of isolated lesions (excluding dissections)
of the descending segment of the thoracic aorta. This expanded indication
includes the treatment of transections, commonly known as blunt traumatic aortic
injuries.



The second leading cause of traumatic death after head injuries, transection of
the thoracic aorta represents a dire medical emergency in which the upper area
of the body's main artery tears due to extreme force to the chest, usually the
result of motor vehicle accidents, elevated falls or other high-impact
deceleration episodes.

The Valiant stent graft, a tubular medical device consisting of a specially
woven fabric sewn onto a flexible wire-mesh frame, can now be used in U.S.
clinical practice to stabilize bleeding from descending thoracic aortic
transections as an alternative to invasive surgery.

Previously approved by the FDA for the endovascular repair of aneurysms and
penetrating ulcers of the descending thoracic aorta, the Valiant Captivia stent
graft system has been widely available in the United States since May 2012.

The device is implanted in a minimally invasive procedure that uses a catheter
inserted into the femoral artery, located in the groin. This technique requires
only a small incision to access the aorta as opposed to larger incisions
required for open surgery.

Compressed inside the delivery system, the device passes through several
arteries in the abdomen and up the aorta to the location of the damaged area. By
turning a mechanism on the handle of the delivery system, the stent graft
flowers open from top to bottom, creating a new path for blood flow and reducing
the risk of rupture, a complication that usually results in death.

The new indication for thoracic aortic transections followed the FDA's review of
the results of a clinical study called the RESCUE trial, which enrolled 50
patients across 20 U.S. and Canadian sites and met its primary endpoint with a
30-day all-cause mortality rate of 8.0 percent. Six-month results from the
RESCUE trial will be presented later this week in New York to attendees of the
VEITHsymposium, which begins on Wednesday.

"This new indication of the Valiant Captivia stent graft system reduces the
morbidity and mortality rates associated with surgical repair of transected
aortas," explained Dr. Rodney White, chief of vascular surgery at Harbor-UCLA
Medical Center in Torrance, Calif., and the principal investigator of the RESCUE
trial. "When surgery is the only other option for repairing an aortic
transection, the Valiant Captivia system can literally be a life-saver."

Medtronic stent grafts have been used to treat approximately 300,000 patients
worldwide. Long-standing market leaders in the product category, the company's
global portfolio includes the Endurant II AAA and Valiant Captivia stent graft
systems.

"Our vision is for endovascular repair to be applicable to more patients,"
explained Tony Semedo, vice president and general manager of Medtronic's
Endovascular Therapies business. "With this new indication for the Valiant
Captivia system in the United States, that vision comes into sharper focus."

New owner plans changes at Delmont health center

BYLINE: C.M. Mortimer

LENGTH: 346 words


Center Ice Fitness in Delmont is under new management.

Steve Beach, 34, of Prescott, Ariz., recently acquired the 7,200-square-foot
facility, which connects with Center Ice Arena, from John Bonaroti, of
Murrysville. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.

Beach, who sold three health clubs in Arizona, said he plans to update some of
the equipment and possibly add specialized strength-building equipment for
athletes.

"I just wanted something smaller, with a family-oriented feel," he said.

"What a great opportunity, having a fitness center connected to a hockey arena,"
said Beach, a Canadian native and admittedly a big hockey fan. Beach said his
fitness clubs in Arizona were open 24 hours daily, and he may do the same with
the Delmont facility.

Bonaroti, who owned the facility for six and a half years, said he sold the
business because he wanted to devote more time to his primary business, East
Suburban Sports Medicine, headquartered in Murrysville.

"I couldn't commit the proper time," he said.

o Terry Graft and James Jacquillard, both Scottdale natives, have teamed to open
Graft-Jacquillard Funeral & Cremation Services Inc., at the corner of Pittsburgh
and Chestnut Streets in Scottdale.

The business was started after the duo purchased the Caruso Memorial Home,
formerly the James C. Murphy Memorial Home.

Graft owns the Kepple-Graft Funeral Home in Greensburg. Jacquillard said they
intend to promote themselves as a community resource center, in an effort to go
beyond providing customary funeral services.

"We want to let folks know that it's OK to seek advice when something is on
their mind. We want people to call us or stop by with questions or concerns they
might have," Jacquillard said.

The partners have made several changes to the business, including incorporating
a logo depicting a butterfly with wildflowers on the funeral home sign --
representing hope, peace and tranquility. Other improvements included painting
the exterior, new signs, doors, furnishings and fixtures. The driveway entrance
was raised to accommodate handicapped individuals.

Durant to have another surgery, miss rest of season

SECTION: BREAKING

LENGTH: 379 words


OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- NBA MVP Kevin Durant will miss the rest of the season and
have bone graft surgery next week to treat a fractured bone in his right foot.

The Oklahoma City Thunder had said last week he likely would be shut down for
the season. The team was trying to figure out why his pain remained long after
he was supposed to be able to play.

General manager Sam Presti said Friday the team expects Durant to return to
basketball activities within the four to six months.

He said this decision was aimed at Durant's "long-term health and stability" and
represented a consensus of Durant and his representatives, specialists and the
team. The procedure was termed the "most proactive and recommended approach."

The Thunder are in position to make the playoffs without Durant, but they
clearly will miss one of the game's most dynamic players. Durant last played
Feb. 19 before the discomfort became too much to bear. He has played in just 27
games, averaging 25.4 points, 6.6 rebounds and 4.1 assists.

Durant had his initial surgery in October and had been healing well. But in late
February, he had a procedure to replace a screw that was rubbing against another
bone. After that second surgery, the Thunder expected him to return in one to
two weeks.

Durant then consulted with three foot and ankle specialists. It was determined
there still was pain from the rubbing, plus regression in the initial break. It
was then decided to proceed with the bone graft, Presti said.

A week ago, Presti said Durant was struggling and the team did not want to rush
him back. When asked if it would be best to end Durant's season, Presti said:
"Essentially, that's the direction that we're taking right now."

Presti said the bone graft is a common procedure to fix the less than 10 percent
of such foot operations that don't work out.

"While everyone is disappointed that Kevin falls into that group, we are
encouraged that the bone graft procedure has historically demonstrated long-term
health and stability," Presti said.

The Thunder entered Friday three games ahead of Phoenix for the No. 8 spot in
the Western Conference standings. Point guard Russell Westbrook has emerged as
an MVP candidate. He leads the league with 27.3 points per game while averaging
8.7 assists and 7.1 rebounds.

Heparin is the device coating of choice for Sweden's Carmeda

Heparin is the device coating of choice for Sweden's Carmeda

 By HOLLAND JOHNSON

Medical Device Week Staff Writer

Medical devices have been implanted for years without any sort of protective
covering. Often, however, anticoagulation drugs must be administered to prevent
the body from building up defenses against these foreign but necessary invaders.
Alternatively, special coatings enable many products to function properly and
reduce the threat of infection and rejection.

Enter the heparin coating, which improves the hemocompatibility of
blood-contacting medical devices. Heparin has been widely used for
anticoagulation purposes for at least five decades. As a coating, however, it
has only been used on medical devices in the past decade. One company working in
this relatively new field is Carmeda AB (Stockholm, Sweden), a subsidiary of
Norsk Hydro ASA.

"We have seen a heparin coating used on external circuits - primarily in
ventricular devices - as long as 10 years ago," Andrew Jacobson, director of
business development for Carmeda, told Medical Device Week. "It is only in the
past four years that we have seen these coatings used on permanent internal
devices, which is what we are now concentrating on."

Carmeda's coating is called Carmeda BioActive Surface (CBAS), and it is
covalently bound to a device surface, which prevents it from leaching off. "Many
of our competitors employ an ionic compound of heparin which leaches off the
device. This may cause a reduced thrombogenicity of the surface of a device,"
Jacobson said.

CBAS coated surfaces are designed to dramatically reduce the thrombus formation
on these devices, Jacobson said, the heparin used to mimic "the only truly
blood-compatible surface, the natural blood vessel wall." While it is not known
yet if the CBAS coating is truly permanent, Jacobson said that he feels that the
coating remains on the device at least through the critical time for the device.
"Once the device is successfully masked by heparin, it is not necessary that the
coating remain," Jacobson said

Other companies are exploring this use of coatings, he said, adding that Carmeda
"is trying to get in on the ground level of development with these products. It
is much easier to work on products in development than to add the coating to
products that are already approved."

The list of clients using CBAS technology is already substantial: Medtronic
(Minneapolis, Minnesota), using the coating for its Maxima oxygenation circuits
for coronary artery bypass; Johnson & Johnson subsidiary Cordis (Miami Lakes,
Florida), in its newly CE-marked Bx Velocity stent; Mediport (Berlin, Germany),
on its Berlin heart ventricular assist device; Diametrics (Roseville,
Minnesota), in its Paratrend intravascular blood gas sensor.

Using CBAS in perhaps the most unique fashion is Pharmacia & Upjohn (Peapack,
New Jersey), for intraocular lenses. The company says that the heparin coating
increases the biocompatibility of intraocular lenses by reducing foreign body
reaction - up to one year thus far - after cataract surgery.

Another interesting use is being explored by Gore (Putzbrunn, Germany), which is
working on using the coating for vascular grafts. Without providing many
details, Jacobson said that Gore is working on "the Holy Grail of the graft
industry, patency for 3 mm or smaller grafts. Gore is working on these synthetic
grafts to replace the current procedure of having to graft smaller veins from
the leg and other areas of the body."

Competition within the market is still relatively open. Carmeda's rivals include
SurModics (Eden Prairie, Minnesota), Biocompatibles (Surrey, United Kingdom),
and Duraflow (Blaine, Washington), plus a host of smaller companies.

Carmeda has two financing models. In the first, it sets up licensing deals,
coupled with royalty payments, to sell the coating to a company. In the other
model, Carmeda does contract coating for a company.

"This has been a slowly emerging market," Jacobson said, "but I feel it is just
beginning to flourish. The problem we face is that the FDA requires new data for
every additional product we coat because they don't have any data already
available on heparin coating. They [FDA] need to enact a regular standard for
our segment of the industry. I hope that we as an industry can get together to
lobby the FDA."

Jacobson also noted various potential new uses for the coating, including venous
catheters, artificial hearts, heart valves and shunts.

As to why it has taken so long for internal device coating market to emerge as a
market, Jacobson said he felt it was because many companies initially don't want
to invest in the extra research necessary. But, he said they have finally
"warmed up" to the idea. "These coated products aren't a cure-all," he added,
"but they do enhance the quality of a procedure, and I think that makes them
relevant."

Carmeda has been in business since 1985, and employs 25.

The Doctor's World;
Technique Changes In Bypass Surgery

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN, M.D.

SECTION: Section C; Page 1, Column 5; Science Desk

LENGTH: 1353 words


HEART surgeons are increasingly turning to a new technique for coronary bypass
surgery that promises longer-term success and fewer complications than the
method that has been common for decades.

Rather than using sections of a leg vein to bypass blocked coronary arteries,
the doctors are turning to a blood vessel in the chest.

For reasons that defy explanation, these blood vessels, internal mammary
arteries, rarely develop the fatty deposits that characterize atherosclerosis,
the artery-blocking condition that makes the surgery necessary in the first
place.

Surgeons are using the arteries, also known as internal thoracic arteries,
whenever possible in the operation that is commonly done to relieve the chest
pains from angina. Men and women have two internal mammary arteries, one on each
side behind the ribs near the breastbone.

The object of bypass surgery is to take a vessel from elsewhere in the body, sew
it into a coronary artery to develop a flow of blood around the blocked area and
to supply vital nutrients to the heart. But the benefits of the operation last
only as long as the new vessels stay open.

Surgeons first turned to veins because they were more accessible and because
efforts to use other arteries were generally unsuccessful for a variety of
reasons. The saphenous veins of the leg became the standard. Other veins quickly
took over their functions in the leg, just as other arteries take over the
function of the internal mammary arteries that are removed in the newer
procedure.

In many patients, vein grafts function well 15 or more years after the surgery.

But in other patients the grafts can have a more limited life span because the
thinner walls of the veins are less able to withstand the pressures in an
artery. Further, the transplanted veins can become blocked by plaques, much like
the arteries they replace. Many bypass patients require another operation and in
some cases suffer heart attacks and die.

The new wave of enthusiasm for internal mammary arteries reflects studies
showing that grafts from these vessels can stay open much longer than those from
leg veins. The studies have also found that patients who undergo such grafts
live longer, take longer to develop recurrences of angina, have fewer heart
attacks, fewer repeat bypass operations, and fewer complications than did those
who had vein grafts.

Several decades ago doctors used internal mammary arteries in a different type
of operation for angina, a generally unsuccessful one known as the Vineberg
procedure. In the procedure, the mammary artery was linked directly to the heart
muscle in hopes of increasing the blood flow to the heart.

The current use of internal mammary arteries for coronary bypass surgery was
pioneered in the late 1960's by Dr. George E. Green, then at New York University
and now at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in New York.

At the time, many experts believed that the internal mammary artery, often only
two millimeters in diameter, was too small for splicing into the coronary
arteries. But Dr. Green recalled in an interview that he shifted his research
from other vessels to the internal mammary artery after another surgeon made him
aware that ''the limiting factor was the eye, not the hand.'' By using the
operating microscope to magnify the vessel, Dr. Green was able to accomplish the
mammary artery graft successfully.

''Many years ago George Green stood alone in support of the internal mammary
artery as a superior conduit,'' Dr. John L. Ochsner of the Ochsner Clinic in New
Orleans has written. ''In the years since, many of us have joined his ranks.''

But they did so slowly. American surgeons used internal mammary arteries in
6,000 of 188,000 coronary bypass operations in 1983 and in 67,000 of 284,000
such operations in 1986, according to the American Heart Association. Several
leading heart surgeons and cardiologists estimated in interviews that about 80
percent of coronary bypass operations now involve the use of internal mammary
arteries or a combination of the artery and the vein. They cite favorable
long-term results reported by groups such as those headed by Dr. Floyd D. Loop
at the Cleveland Clinic and Dr. Airlie Cameron of St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital
Center.

Internal mammary artery graft operations take longer and are technically more
difficult than leg vein grafts. Surgeons, often aided by microscopes or
magnifying loupes, must take care not to tear the small artery or its many tiny
branches.

But even with these aids, a slight lapse in technique can produce poor results.
Because the artery is so small, an improperly placed suture can narrow it enough
to forever limit the blood flow.

Thus many surgeons wanted convincing data before they were willing to turn from
vein grafts to the internal mammary artery grafts. It took years to do the
studies that have shown the superiority of the newer technique. Along the way
there was considerable debate. When only short-term results were available, the
benefits of mammary artery grafts were only slightly better than those of vein
grafts. But the benefits generally became clearer five or more years after the
bypass operation.

The mammary artery grafts often produces more chest pain in the first two weeks
or so after the operation because the procedure involves more trauma to the
chest wall than does the vein graft operation.

Because the size of the thin artery varies among different people, some surgeons
are unwilling to perform the procedure on all patients needing coronary bypass
operations. Sometimes they cannot discover whether a patient is a suitable
candidate until they view the artery.

Dr. O. Wayne Isom, the chief heart surgeon at New York Hospital, said he
recently severed a patient's internal mammary artery and measured the amount of
blood that flowed through it in an effort to determine if it was wide enough to
function as a coronary artery. The artery did not pass the test. He closed the
open end of the vessel, left it in place, and used leg veins instead. But Dr.
Isom said not all heart surgeons agree on the validity of the flow test.

Even when internal mammary arteries can be used, useable portions may be too
short to supply enough grafts to bypass all the blocked coronary arteries. For
anatomical reasons, the left internal mammary artery is more useful than the
right. But surgeons sometimes use both mammary arteries.

Also, the procedure generally takes about five hours, up to an hour longer than
the vein graft. Thus surgeons tend to avoid using the mammary artery graft on
older patients and those who are having emergency bypass surgery during a heart
attack.

The plaques from atherosclerosis tend to strike medium-sized and larger arteries
like those in the heart and brain more often than smaller ones elsewhere.
Theoretically, such damage should be equally distributed in the arteries of the
body, or at least in arteries of the same size because the blood that flows
through all arteries contains the same amount of cholesterol and other fats. But
in reality the damage is often selective, sparing some medium and large arteries
and devastating others.

''Certain vessels may carry blood for a whole lifetime without showing
significant arterial disease,'' said Dr. Frank H. Sims, a pathologist at the
University of Auckland Medical School in New Zealand, who has made anatomical
studies of the artery. ''Any valid theory of arteriosclerosis must explain the
freedom of these vessels from disease as well as the lesions in the affected
arteries.''

There are many theories to explain the phenomenon, including such explanations
as differences in rates of flow of blood and regional variations in biochemical
reactions. Dr. William C. Roberts of the National Institutes of Health and other
heart experts said no one had figured out why internal mammary arteries so
seldom become clogged.

But all agree that the mystery is a critical question that has not received the
research attention it deserves. If the magic of the internal mammary artery can
be applied to other vessels, many lives could be saved.

Woodruff Health Sciences Center: New Technique to Improve Blood Flow in Children
Born with One Functional Ventricle Shows Promise in Pilot Study

LENGTH: 996  words


New Delhi, Sept. 7 -- Two in every thousand babies born in the United States
start life with just one functional ventricle, or pumping chamber, instead of
the normal two. These babies typically undergo a series of two or three
open-heart surgeries, culminating in a "total cavopulmonary connection" (TCPC),
which is known as the Fontan procedure. During this process, surgeons redirect
the circulation to allow oxygen-poor blood to flow from the body directly to the
lungs passively, without the benefit of a pumping chamber.



A team of surgeons and university researchers recently reported promising
results from a novel surgical connection intended to streamline blood flow
between the heart and lungs of such infants.

Typically, the final stage of the Fontan procedure is performed by connecting a
cylindrical conduit to the pulmonary arteries, forming a 'T' shaped junction. In
a pilot study, six patients at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta received a
commercially available Y-shaped conduit for their Fontan procedure instead of
the cylindrical conduit to create a smoother transition of the blood flow to the
pulmonary arteries. Postoperative imaging data from five of the patients
indicated improved blood flow distribution and similar energy efficiency when
compared with computer simulations of two alternative connections the patients
could have received instead of a Y-graft.

"Based on improved energy characteristics predicted by computer modeling for the
Y-shaped conduit, we felt it was time to try it in the clinical realm," said
Kirk Kanter, M.D., chief of cardiothoracic surgery at Children's Healthcare of
Atlanta and professor of surgery at Emory University School of Medicine, who
performed the operations. "The pilot study revealed that surgical implementation
of a Y-graft for Fontan procedures is feasible and promising because early
outcome was good in these patients."

The surgical procedure and the postoperative outcomes were detailed in two
articles recently published online in the Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular
Surgery. The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health and the
American Heart Association.

Also involved in the study were Ajit Yoganathan, Ph.D., Regents' professor in
the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Tech and
Emory University; W. James Parks, M.D., associate professor of pediatrics and
radiology at Emory University and Children's Healthcare of Atlanta at Egleston;
Mark A. Fogel, M.D., director of cardiac magnetic resonance at The Children's
Hospital of Philadelphia; Georgia Tech School of Interactive Computing Professor
Jarek Rossignac, Ph.D., and Coulter Department graduate student Christopher
Haggerty.

The TCPC typically creates a four-way intersection. Blood from the upper half of
the body enters the intersection from the top and blood from the lower body
enters from the bottom. The blood flows collide and mix in the intersection
before they are split and redirected 90 degrees toward the left or right
pulmonary arteries. The collision of blood from the two veins at the
intersection causes inefficient blood flow.

Because the blood flows passively from the body to the lungs without being
pumped by the heart, it is assumed that any energy inefficiencies inherent in
the construction of the Fontan pathway may translate into diminished life
expectancy and quality of life.

Substituting a Y-shaped conduit should avoid the collision of blood in the
intersection and enable a smooth and streamlined transition of the blood to the
pulmonary arteries, which carry deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs.

For the pilot study, Kanter surgically implanted a commercially available Y-
graft, made of a synthetic polymer called polytetrafluoroethylene, in each
patient to direct flow from the lower half of the body to the left and right
pulmonary arteries. This was a variation of a conduit design, called the
Optiflo, which was patented by Yoganathan and colleagues for its ability to
efficiently direct an even distribution of blood flow to the left and right
pulmonary arteries.

After surgery, the researchers acquired cardiovascular images to evaluate the
operative connections. The images allowed Yoganathan and Haggerty to evaluate
the hemodynamic outcomes of the surgical procedures for five of the patients and
compare them to the simulated outcomes of two alternative connections patients
could have received instead of a Y-graft.

They used the images to model blood flow through the arteries under resting and
exercise conditions. These simulations assessed the robustness of each
connection geometry because small inefficiencies under resting conditions may be
amplified with higher flows.

Results for the patients who received the Y-graft showed balanced distribution
of flow to both pulmonary arteries with minimal flow disturbance. The resistance
of the vessels to blood flow at the connections varied considerably among
patients, but the Y-graft results demonstrated resistance levels similar to the
alternative connections in four of the five patients and marked improvement in
the remaining patient.

"We found desirable flow distribution characteristics using the Y-graft, but the
flow efficiency performance fell short of the outcomes we previously predicted,"
said Yoganathan. "The results suggest that the Y-graft performs as well as the
standard procedure with a T-graft even when the Y-graft design is theoretically
sub-optimal."

The study allowed the researchers to identify ways of refining the surgical
technique that should help them improve the theoretical efficiency of the
conduit design. Before conducting future clinical trials, the research team
plans to address two features of the Y-graft design that limited hemodynamic
efficiency in the current study. They plan to introduce curvature to the Y-graft
branches and extend the distance between the Y-graft branches to reduce
continued interaction and mixing between the two blood streams.

Kirk Kanter, M.D., chief of cardiothoracic surgery at Children's Healthcare of
Atlanta and professor of surgery at Emory University School of Medicine, who
performed the operations. "The pilot study revealed that surgical implementation
of a Y-graft for Fontan procedures is feasible and promising because early
outcome was good in these patients."

The surgical procedure and the postoperative outcomes were detailed in two
articles recently published online in the Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular
Surgery. The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health and the
American Heart Association.

Also involved in the study were Ajit Yoganathan, Ph.D., Regents' professor in
the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Tech and
Emory University; W. James Parks, M.D., associate professor of pediatrics and
radiology at Emory University and Children's Healthcare of Atlanta at Egleston;
Mark A. Fogel, M.D., director of cardiac magnetic resonance at The Children's
Hospital of Philadelphia; Georgia Tech School of Interactive Computing Professor
Jarek Rossignac, Ph.D., and Coulter Department graduate student Christopher
Haggerty.

The TCPC typically creates a four-way intersection. Blood from the upper half of
the body enters the intersection from the top and blood from the lower body
enters from the bottom. The blood flows collide and mix in the intersection
before they are split and redirected 90 degrees toward the left or right
pulmonary arteries. The collision of blood from the two veins at the
intersection causes inefficient blood flow.

Because the blood flows passively from the body to the lungs without being
pumped by the heart, it is assumed that any energy inefficiencies inherent in
the construction of the Fontan pathway may translate into diminished life
expectancy and quality of life.

Substituting a Y-shaped conduit should avoid the collision of blood in the
intersection and enable a smooth and streamlined transition of the blood to the
pulmonary arteries, which carry deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs.

For the pilot study, Kanter surgically implanted a commercially available Y-
graft, made of a synthetic polymer called polytetrafluoroethylene, in each
patient to direct flow from the lower half of the body to the left and right
pulmonary arteries. This was a variation of a conduit design, called the
Optiflo, which was patented by Yoganathan and colleagues for its ability to
efficiently direct an even distribution of blood flow to the left and right
pulmonary arteries.

After surgery, the researchers acquired cardiovascular images to evaluate the
operative connections. The images allowed Yoganathan and Haggerty to evaluate
the hemodynamic outcomes of the surgical procedures for five of the patients and
compare them to the simulated outcomes of two alternative connections patients
could have received instead of a Y-graft.

They used the images to model blood flow through the arteries under resting and
exercise conditions. These simulations assessed the robustness of each
connection geometry because small inefficiencies under resting conditions may be
amplified with higher flows.

Results for the patients who received the Y-graft showed balanced distribution
of flow to both pulmonary arteries with minimal flow disturbance. The resistance
of the vessels to blood flow at the connections varied considerably among
patients, but the Y-graft results demonstrated resistance levels similar to the
alternative connections in four of the five patients and marked improvement in
the remaining patient.

"We found desirable flow distribution characteristics using the Y-graft, but the
flow efficiency performance fell short of the outcomes we previously predicted,"
said Yoganathan. "The results suggest that the Y-graft performs as well as the
standard procedure with a T-graft even when the Y-graft design is theoretically
sub-optimal."

The study allowed the researchers to identify ways of refining the surgical
technique that should help them improve the theoretical efficiency of the
conduit design. Before conducting future clinical trials, the research team
plans to address two features of the Y-graft design that limited hemodynamic
efficiency in the current study. They plan to introduce curvature to the Y-graft
branches and extend the distance between the Y-graft branches to reduce
continued interaction and mixing between the two blood streams.

Report from Europe

Centerpulse continues selloff of its cardiovascular units

A Medical Device Daily Staff Report  Centerpulse (Zurich, Switzerland) said
Friday that it is selling its Vascutek (Glasgow, Scotland) vascular-grafts
business to Terumo (Tokyo) in a deal valued at $170 million. Vascutek, which
Sulzer acquired in 1990, is a maker of vascular prosthetic grafts for treating
diseased and damaged arteries. Its knitted and woven polyester grafts are
produced in both sealed and unsealed versions.

Vascutek also is developing the Anaconda, a modular system designed for
endovascular aneurysm repair. The company says its implants, consisting of
nitinol combined with a woven prosthesis, can be delivered through smaller
introducers than other available systems. The company, which has just under $24
million in annual revenues, employs about 240. Its U.S. plant is located in
Austin, Texas.

The sale is pending regulatory approval and is expected to close next month,
according to Centerpulse.

The former Sulzer Medica said the sale is the second step in its plan to divest
its cardiovascular interests, following the sale of IntraTherapeutics (St. Paul,
Minnesota) for $95 million. Sulzer had acquired IntraTherapeutics for $145
million just last year. The company's products include balloon-expandable,
non-coil stents and self-expandable coil and non-coil stents for use in
peripheral arteries.

Centerpulse said that firm bids are expected soon on its remaining
cardiovascular businesses. The company reported earlier this year (Medical
Device Daily, June 13, 2002) its intention to divest its cardiac and vascular
operations in order to put greater focus on its core orthopedic, spine, dental
implant and biologics activities.

Agency to be 'powerhouse for improvement'  The plan to merge the UK's Medical
Devices Agency (MDA) and Medicines Control Agency into a single entity next year
will be a "powerhouse for improvement" in the regulation of healthcare
technologies and therapies, says Health Minister Philip Hunt. Speaking at the
device agency's annual conference last month, Hunt said the formation of the
Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) will represent "a
model of common sense and proportionate regulation."

He said the new agency would be "all about patient safety." Assuring such safety
"is not an optional extra," Hunt said. "People going into hospital or being
treated at home . . . believe that everything is there to make them well again
and that healthcare products and medicines are safe and effective."

The British government said in mid-September that the MHRA would make its bow
next April. At that time, Hunt said that a key reason for merging the existing
agencies into one was "the increasing convergence in the fields of
pharmaceuticals and medical devices." As technology develops, "there are likely
to be growing numbers of products that cross the borderline between medicines
and devices."

New NICE guy in UK  Leon Fine, MD, a professor of medicine at University College
London, has been named a non-executive director on the board of the UK's
National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE). Well-known in the field of
renal medicine, Fine has practiced medicine in the U.S. and Israel in addition
to the UK. He said he welcomed the opportunity to contribute to the process of
improving the quality of healthcare in the National Health Service as a member
of the board of NICE, which makes decisions on the adoption of new medical
technologies within the NHS.

Kevin Durant out remainder of the season

BYLINE: Michael Kinney, The Moore American, Norman, Okla.

SECTION: SPORTS

LENGTH: 489 words


March 27--The Oklahoma City Thunder made it official today. Kevin Durant will
not play again the rest of the 2014-15 season according to general manager Sam
Presti.

The Thunder sidelined Durant indefinitely last week after persistent soreness in
his foot following what was thought to be a minor surgery on Feb. 22. At that
point, Presti said a team of specialist would be evaluating Durant to determine
a next step. That next step appears to be a third surgery to his foot.

"As we communicated last week, Kevin was going to use this time to engage in
consultation and evaluation regarding the persistent soreness in his right foot
at this stage of his rehabilitation," Presti said. "As part of this process,
Kevin and Thunder personnel traveled to two additional specialists this past
week ... Several conference calls and discussions amongst the specialist team
concluded that, while the majority of the soreness in Kevin's foot was related
to continued inflammation of the cuboid bone and would subside with rest, the
evaluation process also determined that the Jones fracture of the fifth
metatarsal, which had shown significant healing previously, was now
demonstrating signs of regression."

The specialist team included Dr. Martin O'Malley in New York City and Dr. James
Nunley of Duke University. Presti said These in-person consults were designed to
further supplement the previous evaluations of Dr. Bob Anderson.

"With the focus of this process being aimed entirely on Kevin's long term health
and stability, it was the consensus of the specialists team, in addition to a
collective decision by Kevin, his representation and the Thunder, that to
address the setback of the fracture site, a bone graft procedure would be the
most proactive and recommended approach," Presti said. "The bone graft is the
standard procedure for the 5 to 8 percent of Jones fracture surgeries that do
not initially have success or experience setbacks sometime within the recovery
period. While everyone is disappointed that Kevin falls into that group, we are
encouraged that the bone graft procedure has historically demonstrated long-term
health and stability."

According to the Thunder, O'Malley will perform the bone graft surgery early
next week in New York.

"He has extensive bone grafting experience amongst athletes and has been
consulting on the case throughout," Presti said. "Kevin will miss the remainder
of the 2014-15 season and is expected to return to basketball activities in the
next four to six months."

After the Thunder's game in Utah tonight, nine games will remain in the regular
season. Oklahoma City, holding onto eighth place in the Western Conference,
currently occupies the final playoff position in the conference.

"Prognostic methods useful in assessing patients who have received a transplant
and reagents that can be used to carry out those methods are provided. The
inventions are based, in part, on our analysis of gene expression in renal
allografts and clinical parameters, i.e., variables associated with the donor,
the recipient and/or the graft. The genes that can be assessed include those
encoding agents that mediate inflammation, immune activation, and cell death (we
may refer to these genes as "inflammatory", "immune" or "cytoprotective").
Surprisingly, the levels of gene expression could predict the occurrence of DGF,
AR, and the quality of later graft function even when analyzed shortly after
(e.g., after vascular anastomosis and tissue reperfusion). We also found that
clinical parameters available at the time of transplantation correlate with
decreased graft health and can be considered in combination with gene expression
to evaluate a patient's risk for an adverse outcome."

reached for what he knows best -- NovaBone, a synthetic bone graft his company
makes.

Wotiz packed the wound with the salt-like crystals and applied ice, which
stopped the bleeding and speeded up the healing, he said. The CEO was back in
his corner office in St. Nicholas the following Monday with only a band-aid
hinting at the eventful weekend.

And Wotiz is not the product's only believer.

Annual sales at Jacksonville-based NovaBone Products have sprinted 50 percent
over last year as the company capitalizes on the white-hot orthopedic market.
The privately held company had 2004 sales of about $3 million.

NovaBone, founded in 2002, makes synthetic bone grafts for oral, facial and
orthopedic applications. The product, placed during surgery, stimulates new bone
to grow and accelerates the healing process. NovaBone is branded as PerioGlas
when marketed for oral applications.

In late September, the company announced a partnership with Edison, N.J.-based
Musculoskeletal Transplant Foundation to market NovaBone worldwide, excluding
China where the manufacturer already has a distributor.

The non-profit Musculoskeletal Transplant Foundation, the world's largest
supplier of human bone tissue, will sell NovaBone to orthopedic surgeons.

"They've got the feet on the street," Wotiz said, adding the venture is expected
to more than double NovaBone's sales in the first year.

While the oral market accounts for about 50 percent of NovaBone's business, the
orthopedic segment is expected to dominate starting in 2006.

The market for orthopedic bone grafts is about $700 million annually in the
United States, compared with a $50 million to $100 million market for oral
applications, Wotiz said.

"Our product is positioned very, very nicely to capture share in a growing
market," he said. "We can grow significantly faster than the market is growing."

NovaBone has been used over 750,000 times, and data from human clinical studies
is proving it works.

"We're experiencing a virtually 100 percent success rate in orthopedic
[applications]," he said. "We have a good long track record of safety and
efficacy."

The nation's demographics help NovaBone, too. As aging baby boomers undergo more
procedures, it increases the demand for the company's bone grafts.

Bone grafts are typically needed after a second or third hip or knee replacement
to help regrow bone lost due to wear and tear, Wotiz said.

Despite the bottom-line optimism, the company faces industry challeneges.

"There's lots of products out there because margins are good," Wotiz said.
"There is cost pressure on the industry in terms of reimbursement [from
insurance companies]."

While declining to disclose the company's profit margins, Wotiz said margins for
bone grafts, industrywide, range from 50 percent to 80 percent.

NovaBone is "well-managed" and flexibile in meeting customer needs, said John
Stevenson, neurosurgeon with the Orthopaedic Institute in Gainesville.

"Their initial product was not overly user-friendly," said Stevenson, who has
used NovaBone for about nine months. "But after discussions with [the company],
they quickly started to try and develop a product that was a lot more
user-friendly."

Stevenson said the company has "huge" potential.

But being able to ramp up production capacity to meet the demand expectations
could be a challenge, he cautioned.

"Right now they are providing a limited amount of product for surgeons,"
Stevenson said.

Grafts yield fewer problems, better tomatoes

BYLINE: CINDY McNATT, rEGISTER COLUMNIST

SECTION: LIFE; Pg. E

LENGTH: 467 words


For the most part, we get the principle of grafting fruit trees, grapes and
roses. A variety of fruit or flower that we love, but might be a little iffy for
various reasons, is grafted onto a sturdier rootstock than the plant would
produce on its own.

The advantages are many. Known rootstocks (like Dr. Huey when it comes to roses)
are vigorous, crop-heavy, cold-hardy and disease-resistant. And any top plant
(scion) grafted onto them will gain these advantages by association.

Grafting woody plants has been around for centuries. But this year, tomato
grafting - a technique that has been used in Europe and Asia - is making its way
around the west.

The principles are the same. Take a known stellar tomato rootstock and graft a
fussier tomato scion onto it.

Log House Plants in Portland, Ore., is introducing grafted tomatoes this year in
the U.S. According to its website, grafted tomatoes produce heavier crops and
improve disease resistance in fussier cultivars.

"Heirloom varieties have the rich flavors but are not disease-resistant," said
Alice Doyle, the nursery owner. "Grafting makes for a healthier, more vigorous
plant."

The technique is especially useful to organic farmers who plant tomatoes in the
same soil year after year. Carefully curated rootstocks resist nematodes,
blight, wilt, root rot and blossom-end-rot and will even produce bumper crops in
depleted soils, all without chemicals.

Doyle says she finds her rootstocks in the Netherlands and buys grafting clips
in Japan. The newly grafted tomatoes sit in a dark and humid room for three days
to reconnect the vascular tissues. Then they go through a weaning period before
they are moved to the greenhouse.

For the home gardener, planting a grafted tomato is a bit different. In this
case, you do not want to plant your tomatoes "deep."

Instead you want to be sure the graft is clearly above the ground so only the
rootstock roots in the garden.

Grafted tomatoes need support, as the graft can be a weak spot that can break if
the plant flops over. Cage and tie these tomatoes right away.

"We've been playing around with grafting two kinds of tomatoes on one plant,"
Doyle said. "For gardeners who don't have a lot of space, one plant in a pot
makes a colorful salad."

Doyle has been combining red and yellow Brandywines and black cherry and snow
wild cherry tomatoes on one plant. These multivariety tomatoes are available
this year.

Log House Plants has probably started a movement toward grafted tomatoes and
vegetables in general. It is something European farmers have been doing for
ages, and the Doyles believe it will benefit backyard gardeners by eliminating a
host of common problems.

You can find a fresh supply of Log House grafted tomatoes at Roger's Gardens in
Corona del Mar.

Medical programs in line for $2.9M

BYLINE: Dayton Daily News

SECTION: NORTHEAST; Pg. Z5-2

LENGTH: 360 words


The Senate has approved legislation that may provide $2.9 million in funding to
several southwestern Ohio projects, according to the office of Sen. Mike DeWine.

"I am particularly glad that money will be going to a number of programs that
will help improve health care for the residents and, in particular, the children
of Southwest Ohio. I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure this
program funding is included in the final version of the bill."

If the funding is included in the final version:

* The Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center would get $700,000 to
purchase equipment that will allow doctors to measure and translate a patient's
proteins into understanding how they reflect their disease.

The equipment would be used for pediatric diseases, including congenital heart
disease, cancer, obesity, diabetes and epilepsy.

* Community Blood Center and Community Tissue Services would get $700,000 to
develop the software and processes that allow the CTS to collect and store
information about the processing of tissue grafts in an electronic format.

The CTS is the largest nonprofit provider of skin grafts to surgeons for severe
burn patients in the United States.

It provides tissue grafts for transplants to all Daytonarea hospitals and
distributes tissue grafts throughout the United States and worldwide.

* Mary Scott Nursing Center would get $400,000 to construct additional resident
rooms, lounge and general storage area.

It also will fund staff training in the area of dementia and memory impairment.

* Miami University would get $400,000 to purchase equipment that can be applied
to detect the early onset, progression and treatment of targeted children's
diseases.

* The National Association for Equal Opportunity in Higher Education would get
$400,000 to fund a pilot program at Wilberforce and Central State universities
that will help students establish responsible financial behavior.

* Southern Ohio Health Services Network would get $300,000 for technology
infrastructure upgrades that will allow the network to not only improve its
management of patient health information but to improve its operation and the
delivery of care.

GREEN--Dr. Howard. After a long illness, Dr. Howard Green passed away on October
31, 2015. Dr. Green was born September 10, 1925 in Toronto, Canada. He received
his Doctorate in Medicine from the University of Toronto in 1947 and was to
spend the rest of his life in medical research. After serving two years as a
Captain in the United States Army, he began his career at New York University
School of Medicine in 1956 and eventually rose to become Professor and Chairman
of the Department of Cell Biology.

From 1970 to 1980, he was a Professor of Cell Biology at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology. In 1980, he became the George Higginson Professor of
Cell Biology and Chairman of the Department Cell Biology at Harvard Medical
School. He stepped down as Chairman in 1993, but continued on as Professor and
actively ran his laboratory until 2013. Over the years, Dr. Green's work focused
mainly on the properties of cells growing in tissue culture. In 1961, his
laboratory created and established lines of fibroblast cells using viral
oncogenes. Further development in his laboratory and in others led to the 3T3
cell lines, which became the basis for much work on cellular oncogenes. In 1974,
using the same lines of 3T3 cells for support; his laboratory developed a system
that allowed the cultivation of large numbers of human skin cells. Sheets of
these cultured cells behaved as skin grafts when applied to open wounds. These
grafts were first tested on small burn wounds in the Burn Unit at the Brigham
and Women's Hospital starting in 1978 and they regenerated a functioning
epidermis in these patients. This method of taking a tiny skin sample from a
patient and using it to generate enough cultured grafts to cover large areas of
the body with the patients own cells was used in children with large burns for
the first time in 1983 at the Shriners' Burn Hospital in Boston. This work, in
addition to being life saving, was the first use of stem cells as a successful
treatment in patients. In order to cope with the demand for these grafts, Dr.
Green founded BioSurface Technology. The company was acquired by the Genzyme
Corporation, where production continues to the present day. In recognition of
this pioneering work, Dr. Green received multiple honors including membership in
the National Academy of Sciences (USA), the American Academy of Arts and
Sciences, and the Institut de France (Academie des Sciences). He was the
President of Scientific Council, Institut Curie, Paris, France from 1999 to
2007. He was awarded the Legion d'Honneur, Republic of France, and received
honorary Doctorates from the University of Connecticut, the University of
Goteborg, Sweden, the State University of New York at Stony Brook, and Louisiana
State University. In addition, he received the following awards: the Blaise
Pascal Medal for Biology and Life Sciences of the European Academy of Sciences,
2007; the Warren Alpert Foundation Prize, 2010; and the March of Dimes Prize in
Developmental Biology, 2012. Dr. Green is survived by his wife of sixty-one
years, Rosine Kauffmann Green, his brother Floyd, his niece Ingrid Fagen, and
his nephew David, as well as an extended family in Canada, the United States,
Australia, and France. 1/3

   Orthovita, Inc. (Orthovita), incorporated in 1992, is a specialty spine and
orthopedic company with a portfolio of orthobiologic and biosurgery products.
Its orthobiologic platform includes products for the fusion, regeneration and
fixation of human bone. Its orthobiologic products are based on its Vitoss Bone
Graft Substitute technology and include the Imbibe Bone Marrow Aspiration System
used with Vitoss. Vitoss is the synthetic bone graft in the United States. Its
orthobiologic products also include Cortoss Bone Augmentation Material and the
Aliquot Delivery System used with Cortoss. The Company' s biosurgery products
include Vitagel Surgical Hemostat, Vitasure Absorbable Hemostat, and the
CellPaker Plasma Collection System used in conjunction with Vitagel, and other
accessories and delivery products that complement Vitagel product.

   Vitoss is a high- porous resorbable beta-tricalcium phosphate bone graft
substitute used to help the body guide the three-dimensional regeneration of the
patient' s own bone. Vitoss integrates into existing bone and allows for bone
in-growth and maturation. The Vitoss Foam products combine its base Vitoss
technology with Kensey' s resorbable biomaterials to produce bone graft
materials. The Vitoss Foam products have the ability to retain biological
fluids, such as blood and bone marrow aspirate in pliable and compression
resistant forms. Vitoss has been used in bone grafting procedures as a bone
graft substitute to provide a synthetic scaffold in a variety of applications,
including those of the extremities, spine and pelvis. Autograft, cadaver
allograft, as well as synthetic scaffolds like Vitoss, are used for
trauma-related bone graft repairs.

   Cortoss is an injectable material that is delivered through a pre-filled,
unit dose, disposable cartridge. The polymerization is a self-setting reaction
that causes Cortoss to harden within minutes. Cortoss provides two stages of
fixation: immediate mechanical interlock into porous bone, followed by intimate
bone apposition over time along the contours of its surface.

   Vertebral augmentation of vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) is a
procedure for repairing fractured vertebrae that can be performed on a hospital
inpatient or outpatient basis or in ambulatory surgery centers, clinics and
physician offices. Screw augmentation is a procedure for securing the fixation
of bone screws used in patients with weak bone caused by osteoporosis. Cortoss
may be used in those procedures where the screws strip or fail to hold the
integrity of the internal fixation construct due to poor bone quality, as is
often the case with osteoporotic bone.

   The Company' s Aliquot Delivery System facilitates delivery of materials to
bony sites, including delivery of Cortoss product directly to the surgical site.
A coaxial system of catheter and syringe dispenser is designed to assure
delivery of material in vertebral augmentation of VCFs and screw augmentation
procedures. It launched the Aliquot system in the United States concurrently
with the limited launch of Cortoss in July 2009. Through microporous
polysaccharide hemosphere technology, Vitasure acts as a molecular sieve to
extract fluids from blood, creating an osmotic action that causes the Vitasure
particles to swell and concentrate serum proteins, platelets, and other elements
on the surface.

·Cyberonics (Houston, Texas) has been notified in a conference call with the FDA
that the agency has deemed the company's depression premarket approval
supplement  (PMA-S) application suitable for filing. In October, Cyberonics
submitted the 87-volume PMA-S to the FDA seeking approval to market its VNS
Therapy System in the U.S. as "as an adjunctive long-term treatment of chronic
or recurrent depression for patients who are experiencing a major depressive
episode that has not had an adequate response to two or more antidepressant
treatments." The PMA-S included acute and one-year data and analyses on 335
patients treated with VNS plus treatment as usual and 125 patients treated only
with treatment as usual.

·Medicsight (London) has received FDA clearance for two of its computer-aided
diagnosis products, enabling U.S. distribution for the first time. MedicHeart is
a new software solution that defines and measures plaque burden, providing a
more reliable prediction of future coronary disease. MedicColon is designed to
replace more invasive and complicated procedures that are not without risk to
the patient. The advent of computed tomography colonography is the latest
technique for imaging the colon; it does however produce over 1,200 separate
images making radiological interpretation difficult. The MedicColon software has
the ability to identify, characterize and classify colonic polyps to enable the
earliest detection of potential colon cancer. The company said an application
also has been made for FDA clearance of MedicLung. MedicLung will commence
commercial trials with a number of medical institutions in the U.S., once
approval has been granted with a view to a full launch in 2Q04, the company
said.

·MedtronicSofamor Danek (Memphis, Tennessee) has received FDA approval for the
expanded use of its Infuse Bone Graft with certain sizes of the Infuse Fix and
Inter Fix RP Threaded Fusion devices in treating back pain. Using Infuse Bone
Graft with the threaded fusion devices reduces the pain and complications
associated with treating degenerative disc disease by eliminating the second
surgery required to harvest bone from a patient's hip for implantation in the
spine, as is done in traditional spinal fusion procedures. Infuse Bone Graft
contains recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein (rhBMP-2), the genetically
engineered version of a naturally occurring protein that is capable of
initiating bone growth in targeted areas in the spine. It is the only bone graft
replacement currently approved by the FDA specifically for treating degenerative
disc disease in the lumbar spine.

·OmniSonics Medical Technologies (Wilmington, Massachusetts) has been granted
three U.S. patents covering its OmniWave Technology platform for treatment of
vascular occlusive disease. No. 6,660,013, titled "Apparatus for Removing Plaque
from Blood Vessels Using Ultrasonic Energy," covers an ultrasonic apparatus for
removing plaque from blood vessels. No. 6,652,547, titled "Apparatus and Method
of Removing Occlusions Using an Ultrasonic Medical Device Operating in a
Transverse Mode," covers an ultrasonic medical device operating in a transverse
mode of vibration for removing vascular occlusions. No. 6,647,755, titled
"Method for Manufacturing Small Diameter Medical Devices," covers methods for
manufacturing small diameter medical devices, such as ultrasonic probes or
wires, for use with the OmniWave Technology platform.

·Sequenom (San Diego, California) has obtained patent number EP0815261B1 from
the European Patent Office, titled "DNA Diagnostics Based On Mass Spectrometry."
This core patent covers processes for detecting target nucleic acid sequences in
a biological sample using mass spectrometry. The patent has been validated in 14
European countries and relates to several patents previously issued in the U.S.

·Synthetic Blood International (SBI; Costa Mesa, California) said that the third
and highest dosing level has been completed in the Phase I human safety study of
Oxycyte, its perfluorocarbon (PFC) based blood substitute and therapeutic oxygen
carrier. This is the most important dose level in the study, the company said,
because it is the dose that will be employed in Phase II clinical studies in
patients that are planned to begin in early 2004. If the safety profile
continues to look favorable, the company said it may be possible to obtain
approval from the FDA for a repeat dose regimen that could be used in cancer
studies. No other PFC-based blood substitute has been approved by the FDA for
repeat dosing, according to SBI.

o A pioneering new system co-developed by Sinai Hospital (Baltimore) orthopedic
surgeons Shawn Standard, MD, head of pediatric orthopedics at the International
Center for Limb Lengthening (ICLL), and John Herzenberg, MD, director of the
ICLL, offers a major advancement in limb lengthening surgery. The Precice Limb
Lengthening System can be used to lengthen limbs that are short as a result of
birth defects or trauma. It is the first externally controllable internal limb
lengthening system to receive FDA clearance. This magnetic-powered device was
invented by engineers at Ellipse Technologies (Irvine, California). The Precise
Limb Lengthening System consists of a telescopic titanium rod that is surgically
implanted into either the femur (thigh bone) or tibia (shin bone). Inside the
rod, a miniature magnetic motor and gear box create the force needed to lengthen
the rod. The power to drive the internal motor is supplied by a magnetic field
generator that is held on the skin next to the leg several times a day for a few
minutes.

o Zimmer Holdings (Warsaw, Indiana), a specialist in musculoskeletal health, and
ISTO Technologies (St. Louis), an orthobiologics company, reported a phase III
clinical study to evaluate DeNovo ET Engineered tissue graft, an engineered
cartilage implant intended to repair cartilage defects in the knee. DeNovo ET
graft is being developed under a collaborative relationship between ISTO and
Zimmer. The phase III study will comprise a randomized, controlled clinical
trial involving 225 patients at up to 25 centers in the U.S. The program is
designed to demonstrate superiority of DeNovo ET graft over the current standard
of care (microfracture) for articular cartilage defects. In preclinical studies,
cartilage cells derived from juvenile tissue demonstrated a significantly
greater capacity for regenerating cartilage compared to cells derived from adult
cartilage. Recognizing and harnessing the significant regenerative capacity
differences between adult and juvenile cells is an underlying principle of
ISTO's platform for cartilage repair.

o CardioTech International (Wilmington, Massachusetts) reported receiving FDA
approval to export its 4 mm graft in further support of the ongoing European
clinical trial of CardioPass, the company's synthetic coronary bypass graft.
CardioPass is designed as an alternative for patients who have undergone repeat
procedures or have insufficient native vessels for bypass, accounting for up to
20% of all bypass procedures. CardioPass is made from ChronoFlex, the company's
biodurable medical-grade polymer and engineered to be pulsatile, biostable,
torque-resistant and suturable. Once implanted, the graft's polymer construction
allows it to incorporate the patient's own cells and tissue, so that the inner
surface mimics the normal environment for blood contact. CardioTech makes
biomaterials for medical devices.

o Echo Therapeutics (Franklin, Massachusetts) reported publication of results
from three pilot clinical studies of its Symphony Transdermal Continuous Glucose
Monitoring (tCGM) system in the Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology. The
company said that the article highlights that each of the three pilot clinical
studies produced positive results supporting the use of Echo's Symphony tCGM
System for non-invasive, real-time continuous glucose monitoring, and its
recently developed skin permeation device, the Prelude SkinPrep System. Echo
makes transdermal devices and specialty pharmaceuticals.

o Lumedx (Oakland, California) has introduced CardioPACS 5.0, the latest version
of its cardiology PACS software. Multi-modality, web-enabled and vendor-neutral,
CardioPACS 5.0 is a next-generation PACS solution that physicians can use to
view diagnostic-quality images in real-time from any network-connected personal
computer in any location -- the operating room, cath lab, a private office,
remote outreach or mobile clinic. CardioPACS offers: on-demand workstations
anywhere in the hospital and throughout the network; imaging for multiple
clinical areas -- Cath, Echo, Nuclear, CT MR, PET CT and SPECT -- at one
workstation; and real-time access to images from any connected location, onsite
or off.

o Lutronic (Princeton Junction, New Jersey) reported receiving FDA clearance for
the eCO2 system. Using what Lutronics calls controlled chaos technology, this
fractional CO2 laser is designed to offer ways to treat deep ablative
indications such as resurfacing and coagulation of soft tissue, textural
irregularities, fine lines, pigmented lesions, vascular dyschromia and rhytides,
plus the ability to combine two operational modes in one delivery system when
deep penetration and greater patient comfort is required. With both static and
dynamic operation modes, users have the capability to stamp up to a 14 mm x 14
mm scan area, as well as the option to "feather" the treatment area to reduce
the "checkerboard" appearance common with current fractional CO2 devices.
Lutronic makes aesthetic and medical lasers.

o Masimo (Irvine, California) said that a clinical study, published in the June
issue of the British Journal of Anaesthesia concluded that Masimo's PVI
measurement "can predict fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated
patients under general anesthesia." PVI is a new measurement available in the
Masimo Rainbow SET platform that allows non-invasive, automated and continuous
monitoring of the variation in the pulse oximeter waveform amplitude during
respiration. Masimo Rainbow SET measures total hemoglobin, oxygen content,
carboxyhemoglobin, methemoglobin, and PVI, in addition to oxyhemoglobin, pulse
rate, and perfusion index, allowing early detection and treatment of
life-threatening conditions.

Medtronic, South Dakota researcher team up for stent to treat risky aneurysm

BYLINE: Robert Digitale, The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa, Calif.

SECTION: BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS

LENGTH: 501 words


April 15--A South Dakota surgeon has teamed up with researchers at Medtronic's
Santa Rosa division to develop a new stent graft system for keeping blood
flowing to key organs in patients with a rare aortic aneurysm that spans the
chest and abdomen, the company announced Tuesday.

The system, considered a less invasive treatment for thoracoabdominal aortic
aneurysms, constructs new pathways for blood to flow when a bulge forms in the
wall of the aorta. What makes the system different from current Medtronic stent
grafts is its ability to add extra pathways that branch out to arteries
providing blood to such organs as the kidneys, spleen and gall blader.

Medtronic is developing the new system under an exclusive patent license
agreement with Sanford Health system of Sioux Falls, S.D.

Sanford Health vascular surgeon Patrick Kelly is credited with creating the new
stent graft's design. Researchers at Medtronic's aortic division headquarters in
Santa Rosa have produced the device, which is being studied by Sanford Health
under the approval of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

"We intend to study the device ... at several other medical centers around the
United States in the coming months and years," said Medtronic spokesman Joe
McGrath. If promising, the study results could provide evidence to obtain FDA
approval for general use of the new system.

Aortic aneurysms are dangerous bulges or ballooning in a segment of the wall of
the aorta. The condition affects an estimated 1.3 million people in the U.S. If
untreated, a rupture in the wall can be fatal.

Some aneurysms are confined to the chest or the abdomen. But thoracoabdominal
aortic aneurysms, the rarest form, start in the chest and extend through the
abdomen. They are especially challenging to treat because they generally involve
branch arteries for a variety of organs. The condition affects several thousand
U.S. patients, most of whom are deemed at high-risk for normal surgery.

"Working with Medtronic could eventually place our solution in the hands of
vascular surgeons around the world to help patients facing a life-threatening
condition," Kelly said in a statement. "We hope that this will have a major
impact on the treatment of one of the most challenging disease processes to face
our specialty."

Since 1999, Medtronic stent grafts have treated more than 400,000 patients
worldwide, more than those from any other device maker, the company said.

"We're very excited to be working with Dr. Kelly and Sanford Health to develop a
standardized stent graft system to address the clinical challenges of repairing
thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms," Daveen Chopra, vice president and general
manager of the Aortic franchise at Medtronic, said in a statement.

(Oakland, CA) ; Eitouni; Hany Basam; (Oakland, CA)

Applicant: Seeo, Inc   Hayward   CA (California)

According to the abstract released by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office:
"Syntheses of graft copolymers based on PEO and fluorinated functional groups
are described. Grafting of fluorinated groups reduces the T.sub.m of PEO and
also increases the miscibility of PEO with ionic liquids, so that addition of
ionic liquids improves ionic conductivity even at room temperature. The
disclosed copolymers containing fluorinated functionality have superior safety
and are more flame retardant as compared to traditional electrolytes. Such
copolymers can be used as either solid or gel electrolytes in Li batteries."

· Applied Imaging (Santa Clara, California) reported the release of the latest
generation of its CytoVision genetic analysis system. This new release provides
the company's clinical laboratory customers with faster processing speed,
additional functionality and improved productivity. Applied Imaging also is
introducing its concept of the paperless genetics lab. By importing and
integrating various documents along with the results of the cytogenetic testing,
CytoVision provides laboratories with an electronic database of information for
seamless access by technologists, lab directors and physicians.

· Corgentech (South San Francisco, California) said it has completed patient
enrollment in a pivotal Phase III clinical trial to evaluate its lead product,
CGT003, a therapy for the prevention of graft failure following coronary artery
bypass graft surgery. CGT003 is an E2F Decoy, an oligonucleotide that binds to
and inactivates the pivotal cell-cycle transcription factor E2F, administered in
Corgentech's drug-delivery device. CGT003 also is being evaluated in a Phase III
clinical trial for the prevention of peripheral arterial bypass graft failure.
The FDA will require both the coronary and peripheral Phase III trials for
approval, and has granted CGT003 fast-track status for these indications.

· Curon Medical (Fremont, California) reported the publication of a study in the
September 2003 issue of Gastroenterology, titled "Improvement of
Gastroesophageal Reflux Symptoms After Radiofrequency Energy: A Randomized,
Sham-Controlled Trial." The study showed that the Stretta procedure, using the
company's Stretta System, significantly reduced gastroesophageal reflux disease
(GERD) symptoms, improved GERD-related quality of life, and improved general
quality of life scores compared to a sham procedure. These statistically
significant differences between the two groups demonstrate that the improvement
in GERD symptoms following the Stretta procedure could not be caused by a
placebo effect.

·Haemonetics (Braintree, Massachusetts) said the FDA has cleared the cell wash
protocol on the Haemonetics ACP 215 platform. The cell wash protocol removes
more than 99% of plasma proteins from red blood cells derived from whole blood
in a fully automated, closed system that supports good manufacturing practices.
The automated, closed system technology reduces labor and decreases the risk of
bacterial contamination of the red cells. The ACP 215 platform was previously
cleared for freezing and thawing of red blood cells used for strategic blood
reserve management.

· Hologic (Bedford, Massachusetts) said that effective Sept. 15, the American
College of Radiology (ACR) became the FDA-approved accrediting body for Lorad
Selenia full-field digital mammography systems. Prior to this approval,
facilities purchasing the Lorad Selenia were required to file directly with the
FDA for an extension of their existing Mammography Quality Standards Act
certification to include the new system and were also required to have a
screen-film system available. Following the appointment of ACR as the
accrediting body for the Lorad Selenia, facilities purchasing the full field
digital mammography system will go directly to the ACR for accreditation and
will no longer be required to have a screen-film system. The FDA will begin
contacting facilities that have previously installed Selenia systems to advise
them of the steps to take to gain accreditation for these units, the company
said.

Spiral Flow Grafts Enhance Patient Outcomes - New Paper Published In 'Annals of
Vascular Surgery'

   Jul 06, 2012

   Vascular Flow Technologies Ltd. (Vascular Flow) reported that the medium term
results of a 'First in Man' structured registry study are due to be published in
the October issue of the Annals of Vascular Surgery. This significant paper
describes a 40 patient, 10 centre study by leading vascular surgeons and doctors
on patients with peripheral arterial disease needing an above-the-knee or
below-the-knee bypass graft.Peripheral arterial disease affects up to 20% of
people over the age of 70. Patients are at high risk for cardiovascular events
in the future, especially those needing bypass surgery. Improvements in bypass
surgery techniques and devices are therefore very significant and a large number
of people could benefit. This study demonstrates the validity of the concept of
Spiral Laminar Flow. It shows patient outcomes equivalent to, or exceeding, any
known prosthetic grafts, including Heparin bonded grafts.Vascular Flow
Technologies is a medical device company operating within the peripheral
vascular market. It's revolutionary and unique Spiral Laminar Flow technology
re-establishes natural blood flow patterns in peripheral vascular and
arteriovenous grafts - helping to keep damaged blood vessels open for longer and

'I can't wait to see my little princess smile'

BYLINE:  BONGEKILE MACUPE

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 2

LENGTH: 421 words


KATLEGO Maseko is counting down the days.

Tomorrow, doctors at the Netcare Garden City Hospital will start waking up her
five-year-old daughter, Celiwe, who has been heavily sedated since last week,
when she underwent a skin graft transplant.

By this time next week, Maseko hopes that she will see her little princess
smile.

"I can't wait to see her open her eyes. I just want to hug and kiss her, play
with her and see her colour-in," said Maseko, who has been at Celiwe's bedside
every day.

Doctors have told her that it would take a few days - but they would start
waking her up |tomorrow.

Last month, the Kagiso-born girl became the second child in Africa to have a
cloned skin transplant after suffering third-degree burns to her back, chest,
stomach and thighs in January, when a friend who was playing with matches
accidentally set her dress alight.

Her procedure, which started out at a laboratory at Genzyme in Boston,
Massachusetts, where her skin was grown before being flown to South Africa for
the transplant, is the same one that Pippie Kruger underwent last year.

On Thursday, doctors checked whether Celiwe's new skin was grafting properly,
and then removed the clips holding the skin in place.

"It was nerve-racking when you don't know what to expect," said Maseko.

The good news was that there was no signs of infection or rejection of the skin
graft, and her temperature and other vital signs remained stable throughout the
painstaking surgical procedure.

Dr Ridwan Mia, who was responsible for Celiwe's plastic and reconstructive
surgery, told The Sunday Independent this week the skin graft had agreed with
Celiwe's body and she was doing "very well".

"She is very stable, and we are very happy that 90 percent of the graft was
successful. She is doing well, and all signs are pointing in the right
direction," said Mia.

Mia said the graft skin was thin and fragile, and would take a while to look
like normal skin.

The next step, said Mia, would be next week, when doctors would try to slowly
wake up Celiwe.

She has been heavily sedated since the transplant to ensure she did not move
around, as this could disrupt the cloned skin and prevent it from grafting
properly.

"At the moment, she is still sedated, but we are gradually lightening the
sedation," said Mia.

This is only the second time in the world that the transplant has been performed
on a dark-skinned patient, and the first time on the African continent.

But Maseko has faith that her daughter will recover fully.

"I believe everything will go right," she said.

Pittsfield soldier has skin graft

BYLINE: DOUG KESSELI OF THE NEWS STAFF

SECTION: Pg. A10

LENGTH: 269 words

DATELINE: PITTSFIELD


The wife and mother of Spc. Craig Ardry, who was injured during an insurgent
ambush in Iraq earlier this month, are expected to leave this morning for Texas
where Ardry is recovering.

Ardry, a Pittsfield resident, underwent skin-graft surgery on an arm and leg
Thursday morning at the Brooks Army Medical Center in San Antonio less than a
day after he arrived from Germany, family members were told.

Doctors have to complete skin work on Ardry's injured leg before they can fully
address the injury to the leg, Ardry's mother-in-law, Georgie Farrin, said
Thursday.

Ardry suffered burns and other injuries April 20 outside the northern Iraq city
of Mosul after a bomb in the road exploded, damaging the lead Humvee that Ardry
was driving. The bomb injured four members of the 133rd Engineer Battalion of
the Maine Army National Guard, one of them fatally.

Early this morning, Ardry's wife, Nanette, and his mother, Carol Wyman, are
expected to fly out to Texas to be with Ardry, who Farrin said is improving. He
remains on a respirator, although Farrin said her son-in-law's lungs are
apparently fine. The respirator is a health precaution for Ardry while he
undergoes surgery, she said.

More than one skin-graft operation may be necessary, Farrin said, because
doctors reported that sometimes skin grafts don't always take the first time.

Family members had hoped that Ardry was going to be flown to the Texas Army
hospital that specializes in burn victims earlier in the week, but they said the
flight from Germany had been held up as military officials waited so burn
victims from more recent incidents could be flown out.

o AMI Semiconductor (AMIS; Pocatello, Idaho), a manufacturer of integrated
mixed-signal and structured digital products, reported that DexCom (San Diego),
a manufacturer of implantable medical devices, is using an AMIS ultra-low power
wireless ASIC system-on-chip (SoC) solution for a new implantable glucose
monitoring system. The specifications for the AMIS solution were developed in
close collaboration between the engineering teams at DexCom and AMIS and
required extremely low power consumption due to implant longevity and size
restrictions. The total average current drain from the battery is less than 3uA.
The AMIS SoC includes a 32kHz oscillator, current and voltage references,
high-precision analog-to-digital converter, digital filtering and sensor bias
running at 100% duty cycle, and a low-duty radio frequency section.

o Kensey Nash (Exton, Pennsylvania) said it has completed enrollment in the
ASPIRE (Angioplasty in SVGs with Post Intervention Removal of Embolic Debris)
study for its new TriActiv FX System. ASPIRE is a multi-center, prospective
registry, designed to support regulatory clearance of the TriActiv FX System in
the U.S. for a saphenous vein graft indication. The company said it expects to
submit a 510(k) application to the FDA within 90 days. The TriActiv System
incorporates a protection balloon guidewire that creates a protected space, a
flush catheter that washes the graft, and an automated extraction system that
removes the debris found in the graft. These three features work in combination
to prevent the debris, found in the graft, from embolizing and potentially
causing a heart attack.

NASS Notebook: Orthofix launches Collage bone graft substitute at NASS

LENGTH: 524 words

A Medical Device Daily Staff Report

Orthofix International (Lewisville, Texas) reported the full market release of
Collage Osteoconductive Scaffold, a new bone graft substitute, for use in spine
and orthopedic indications, at this week's North American Spine Society (NASS;
Burr Ridge, Illinois) meeting held in Chicago.

"We are proud to announce the launch of Collage, our new synthetic platform
based on highly-purified biocompatible materials of ß-TCP and type-1 collagen,"
said Michael Finegan, president of Biologics. "We have been tremendously
successful with Trinity Evolution and can now focus on broadening our portfolio
of biologic products so that we can fulfill all the needs of our customers. The
synthetic segment of the market is large, attractive, and presents a perfect
complement to our existing biologic portfolio."

The U.S. market for synthetic bone graft substitutes is estimated to include
more than 320,000 procedures and is valued at about $360 million annually,
according to a recent iData Research report.

In other conference news:

o K2M (Leesburg, Virginia), a spinal device company developing solutions for the
treatment of complex spinal pathologies and minimally invasive procedures,
reported the launch of the Everest Degenerative Spinal System.

The Everest Degenerative Spinal System is a top-loading pedicle screw system
featuring the ability to accommodate titanium and cobalt chrome rods of two
different diameters, 5.5 and 6 mm, and a screw thread pitch designed to maximize
both osteoporotic and dense bone fixation.

Additionally, this next-generation set screw based system features a mixed
material housing intended to minimize head splay, compared to a screw head made
entirely of titanium, as well as improve the biomechanical performance of the
construct. The modified square thread of the locking set screw improves the
fixation characteristics and reduces the potential for cross-threading.

o Medtronic (Minneapolis) reported the launch of the Aquamantys Mini EVS 3.4
Epidural Vein Sealer. This latest addition to the spine portfolio of the
Advanced Energy business of Medtronic delivers proprietary Transcollation
technology, a combination of RF energy and saline that has been shown to reduce
blood loss during spine surgery.

The Mini EVS 3.4 Epidural Vein Sealer is designed to optimize visibility and
control epidural bleeding by enabling prophylactic compression and treatment of
epidural veins before they begin to bleed. Its insulated shaft enables
simultaneous retraction and electrode use near sensitive tissue such as dura and
nerve roots. The 3.4 mm tip size allows for use in procedures with small
epidural access points.

"The Mini EVS 3.4 will give me the ability to deliver Transcollation technology
through even smaller anatomical access points than I'm capable of now," said
Paul Santiago, a neurosurgeon at Washington University School of Medicine (St.
Louis). "This will be extremely helpful in controlling epidural bleeding before
it becomes a problem, and the small size of the device will also allow me to
maintain visibility around critical structures such as dura and nerve roots."

THE NATION;
True to Form: Life Styles Of the Infamous and Venal

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

SECTION: Section 4;  Page 4;  Column 1;  Week in Review Desk

LENGTH: 993 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON


HERE is the main difference between Democratic and Republican corruption:
Democratic corruption tends to involve hands in the public till; in one word,
graft. Republican corruption is more likely to entail abuse of the power of
government.

Not always, of course. But as is the case with many stereotypes, there is more
than a kernel of truth. The latest example was the 17-felony indictment last
week of Representative Dan Rostenkowski, who as chairman of the Ways and Means
Committee was one of the most influential Democrats in Congress.

Consider the main charges, which are not yet proved: trading stamp vouchers for
cash; padding his payroll with ghost employees who did little or no public work
and who sometimes kicked back part of their pay to his office; putting gifts to
friends on his office expense account; using Government cars for his and his
family's private purposes; ordering an employee to lie to the grand jury
investigating him.

This is the kind of graft that characterized the Democratic big-city political
machines from Boss Tweed's in New York in the 19th century to Richard J. Daley's
in Chicago in the middle of the 20th century, where Mr. Rostenkowski cut his
teeth.

Abscam, the mostly Democratic scandal of the 1970's in which Congressmen took
money from an investigator posing as a sheik in return for putative legislative
favors, amounted to graft. So did the offenses of Jim Wright, the Democratic
Speaker of the House who left office in 1989 largely because of money he made
from a phony book deal. In the last two years, four other Democratic Congressmen
have been convicted of what was essentially graft -- Nick Mavroules of
Massachusetts, Albert Bustamante of Texas, Larry Smith of Florida and Carroll
Hubbard of Kentucky.

Now, compare that with the Watergate and Iran-contra affairs. Richard M. Nixon
had the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Central Intelligence Agency and
even a special group on the White House staff called "plumbers" conduct
surveillance of his political enemies. He wanted the Internal Revenue Service to
harass his critics. He raised the Government's milk-price supports for his
political gain. He ordered the bombing of Cambodia without Congressional
approval and kept the details from the American public.

Under Ronald Reagan, United States policy in Iran and Nicaragua was turned over
to and carried out by a secret band of shady private operators. As was the case
with Watergate, the fundamental processes of Government were undermined.

Obviously, there are enough exceptions to fill a cesspool. Right now,
Representative Joseph M. McDade of Pennsylvania, the top Republican on the
Appropriations Committee, is under indictment on bribery and racketeering
charges that resemble Democratic-style graft. Spiro T. Agnew, Mr. Nixon's Vice
President, was charged with kickbacks, bribery and extortion. On the other hand,
when the Kennedy Administration had the F.B.I. put wiretaps on the Rev. Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr., it was an abuse of the power of Government.

More often than not, however, the rule about Democratic and Republican
corruption rings true.

Corrupting Power



 When Democrats are caught abusing the power of their office, as was the case
when Lyndon B. Johnson used a minor incident in the Tonkin Gulf to justify an
expansion of the war in Vietnam, the party is unforgiving. But graft seems more
easily pardoned. In private conversations last week, one Democratic lawmaker
after another defended Mr. Rostenkowski, saying that many of the offenses he was
accused of -- putting gifts to constituents on his expense account or using
staff members for personal errands -- are commonplace in Congressional offices.
"Maybe these are ethical violations," a friend in Congress said of the charges
against Mr. Rostenkowski, "but felonies? No way."

Many Republican politicians see nothing wrong with what the Reagan White House
did in the Iran-contra affair, and some still defend Mr. Nixon in Watergate.

When corrupt Republicans want to make a few bucks off their public office, they
do not dip directly into the Government's petty cash drawer the way dishonest
Democrats sometimes do. Rather, they twist the rules of government. In the
Reagan Administration, for example, private developers hired prominent
Republican lobbyists to get friendly hearings for their grant and subsidy
requests at the highest levels of the Department of Housing and Urban
Development.

Some Republicans may also tend to be more skeptical of the worth of government
in the first place. "If you believe the entire enterprise is suspect, you're
more likely to try to undermine it," said Representative Barney Frank, a
Democrat from Massachusetts.

Former Senator Warren B. Rudman, Republican of New Hampshire, agreed more or
less with that assessment. "Most Republicans are contemptuous of government," he
said, although he excluded himself from that category. "Few Democrats are."

Frank Mankiewicz, a public relations executive here with deep ties to the
Democratic Party, said the difference was grounded in a class distinction. "The
lower classes steal," he said. "The upper classes defraud. The Republicans don't
need walking-around money."

Another difference did not arise in the Rostenkowski case: sex.

With a very few exceptions (the case against Senator Bob Packwood of Oregon is
one), the sex scandals of recent note have involved Democrats: all three Kennedy
brothers; Gary Hart; Wilbur D. Mills and his plunge into the Tidal Basin with
the stripper Fanne Foxe; Wayne Hays and his secretary, Elizabeth Ray, who told
reporters, "I can't type. I can't file. I can't even answer the phone"; Senator
Charles S. Robb, whose re-election this year is threatened largely because of a
tryst he had with a former beauty queen.

It is hard to imagine Richard Nixon or Gerald Ford or Ronald Reagan or George
Bush facing the same questions Bill Clinton does about promiscuity.

NephRx Corp. Initiates Phase I Trial of its Lead Drug Being Developed for
Prevention of Delayed Graft Function in Kidney Transplant Patients

LENGTH: 671  words

DATELINE: Karachi


Karachi, Nov. 13 -- NephRx Corporation today announced that it has initiated a
Phase I clinical trial of its lead compound NX001 and has successfully dosed the
first subject in the study. NX001, a kidney growth factor peptide that has
demonstrated good safety and promising efficacy in two animal models of acute
renal failure, is in development for the prevention of delayed graft function
(DGF) in kidney transplantation patients.

Separately, NephRx announced that it has been awarded a total of $488,000 in two
federal Qualifying Therapeutic Discovery Project (QTDP) grants. One of the
grants is to support the clinical development program for NX001, and the other
is for NX002, NephRx's derivative of a naturally occurring growth factor in
preclinical development as a treatment for oral mucositis, a common, painful and
dose-limiting side effect of chemotherapy and radiation therapy in patients with
head and neck cancers.

"NX001 has demonstrated promising activity in preclinical models of acute renal
failure, and this clinical program is designed to test its effectiveness in
helping to prevent or treat delayed graft function in renal transplant patients,
a condition that currently lacks effective treatment options," said James
Koziarz, Ph.D., CEO of NephRx Corp. "We also welcome the recently announced
federal grants to support the development of both NX001 and NX002."

DGF affects an estimated 20-25% of the approximately 14,000 renal transplants
performed annually in the U.S. Patients are put on dialysis to "rest" the
transplanted kidney in the hope that this will correct metabolic imbalances and
allow kidney function to return spontaneously. Studies have shown that DGF can
negatively affect future graft function and can increase the incidence of acute
rejection episodes. Kidney grafts with impaired function require the most
intense follow-up and therapeutic management and are accordingly the most
costly.

The NX001 Phase I trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
single ascending dose level study of the safety, tolerability and
pharmacokinetics of NX001 in healthy volunteers.

"The launch of our first human trial represents an important milestone for
NephRx," said F. Gary Toback, M.D., Ph.D., Founding Scientist of NephRx and
Professor of Medicine and Cell Physiology at the University of Chicago Medical
School. "Because the kidney is one of the few human organs with the potential
for self-repair, our kidney growth factor peptide has the potential to stimulate
improved renal function in a number of disorders. We chose DGF as our initial
indication because it represents a well-defined condition where NX001 has the
potential to improve near-term kidney function. If these Phase I results are
positive, Phase II trials in DGF patients could get underway by mid-2011."

NX001 has been designated an orphan drug by the U.S. FDA for this indication.

NX002 has been shown to stimulate the growth of epithelial cells and to promote
mucosal wound healing after injury. In a recent study in a well-validated
mucositis model, animals treated with NX002 had reduced levels of oral
ulceration and a more rapid recovery, with no evidence of toxicity. NephRx
intends to initiate preclinical toxicology studies of NX002 in the coming
months, with clinical trials targeted for late 2011.

The Qualifying Therapeutic Discovery Project, enacted as part of the federal
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, is designed to provide
grants or tax credits to qualified biotechnology company projects that
demonstrate the potential to result in new therapies to treat areas of unmet
medical need; to prevent, detect, or treat chronic or acute diseases or
conditions; to reduce long-term health care costs in the United States; or to
significantly advance the goal of curing cancer within 30 years. Published by HT

FDA APPROVES CORONARY BYPASS DEVICE DEVICE MADE BY SUNNYVALE FIRM SHARPLY
REDUCES MEDICAL RISK

BYLINE: PAUL JACOBS, Mercury News

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. 3C

LENGTH: 413 words


The Food and Drug Administration on Friday approved a new device from PercuSurge
in Sunnyvale that sharply reduces the risk of a procedure performed each year on
thousands of heart patients with diseased coronary bypass grafts.

The device, the first of its kind, was approved to reopen grafts that have begun
to shut down, increasing the risk of heart attacks.

But its use might one day be expanded to include as many as 1 million patients a
year who undergo angioplasty or who have stents installed in their coronary
arteries.

The company, which was acquired last year by Medtronic for $225 million, is also
testing the system in patients with blockages to the arteries that supply the
kidney and the brain.

Vacuums debris

The PercuSurge device is designed to trap and then vacuum up debris that can
flow out of the diseased area during these procedures, causing serious
complications.

"It should be available for sale in the next week or so," said Gary E. Mistlin,
manager of Medtronic's PercuSurge division.

An estimated 500,000 Americans each year undergo coronary bypass surgery, in
which sections of leg vein are used to route blood around blocked coronary
arteries that feed the heart. Within 10 years of surgery, however, 50 percent or
more of those patients will experience blockages in the vein grafts.

More than 100,000 patients a year undergo procedures to reopen their grafts with
angioplasty, using a balloon to open the grafts, or with a stent, a hollow
cylinder, to keep blood flowing.

But those procedures can create small blood clots, cholesterol crystals and
other debris that can trigger a heart attack.

Cardiologists using the PercuSurge system begin by placing a small balloon
downstream from the repair, blocking the flow of blood through the graft. Once
the repair is complete, the trapped debris is removed by suction. Then the first
ballon is deflated and removed.

Quick procedure

"The whole procedure in skilled hands takes from four to six minutes," Mistlin
said.

A company-sponsored trial in 800 patients found that 17 percent of those
receiving standard care developed major problems compared to just 10 percent of
those treated with the new device.

The study demonstrates that the new system "should be considered the standard of
care when treating these grafts," said Dr. Donald S. Baim of Brigham and Women's
Hospital in Boston, who headed the trial.

Shares of Medtronic rose 2 cents to close at $43.

Fayette trio make horror movie

BYLINE: Mark Hofmann, The Daily Courier, Connellsville, Pa.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 588 words


July 29--Three Fayette County men are getting their taste of working on a
feature film shot in Pittsburgh.

Local writer and director Jeff Monahan started shooting his latest horror movie
"Corpsing" in 2011 in several locations in the Pittsburgh area, including
Brentwood and the old Iron City brewery in Lawrenceville.

"Corpsing," explains Monahan of Connellsville, is something of a "romantic
Frankenstein story" about a woman and her relationship between a former lover
and a man/woman that she made.

The film has gone into post-production, which includes editing film, adding
sound effects, voice-over work, music and adjusting the look and pace of the
film.

To do that, Monahan brought on board post-production supervisor and local
musicians from Connellsville to produce the score and soundtrack.

Originally from Greensburg and now living in Uniontown, Marcus Morelli describes
himself as a self-taught editor, beginning his education as a hobby with editing
his own short videos and posting them on YouTube, as well as shooting and
editing music videos.

"I was just doing it for fun," Morelli said, adding that he was introduced to
Monahan by a mutual friend and asked to come on the project as the film was
already edited in a rough cut, but Monahan was looking for someone to do a finer
edit to the movie.

For Morelli, working on the film where many people have worked hard to capture
sights and sounds from Monahan's script on film is quite a departure as he
considered his prior work a one-man show.

"I'm looking at this almost like an audience member," Morelli said. "There's a
lot on my shoulders, but I like a challenge."

The other end of the post production is the soundtrack and score of the movie,
and that fell on the two members of the band "The Lay Jains" and members Stephen
Gallo and Levi Graft, both of Connellsville.

Graft said Monahan contacted him and Gallo after seeing their performance in a
concert last Fall.

"He asked if I'd be interested in scoring the film and so I thought it would be
a great opportunity for Stephen and I," Graft said.

To match the versatile nature of the story and different facets of the movie,
the soundtrack and score demanded and similar styles including classical piano,
dark synthesized music, rock-a-billy sound and other sounds.

"There's definitely a variety of ideas," Gallo said, adding that he and Graft
have more songs for Monahan to pick and choose for the movie.

For Gallo, the major difference between writing music exclusively for the band
and the film is the band is just the collaboration between he and Graft, but for
the movie, they're on a bigger collaboration.

Graft said the biggest challenge for him is working in an open-ended structure,
adding that he's learning how crucial music is for setting the pace to help
viewers pick out certain lines of dialog, sense the momentum and recognize a
wide range of vibes and emotions.

"There are so many ways to achieve those goals," Graft said. "The playground is
huge!"

Monahan said he was pleased with what the three have contributed to his film and
wants to continue to work with them in the future.

He added that they hope to finish post-production at the end of this month with
a goal of world-wide distribution and then possibly a sequel.

Boston Sci's FilterWire embolic protection device gets FDA nod

By HOLLAND JOHNSON  Medical Device Daily Senior Staff Writer  A second company
earned a U.S. regulatory approval this week in the embolic protection field,
joining Medtronic (Minneapolis, Minnesota), whose PercuSurge GuardWire Plus
system was approved by the FDA in June 2001. Such devices are designed to
prevent particles that may be dislodged during a stent or angioplasty procedure
from creating blockages of their own, especially in the small vessels of the
brain or lungs.

Boston Scientific (Natick, Massachusetts) joined the party saying it has
received 510(k) clearance from the FDA to market its FilterWire EX Embolic
Protection System to treat saphenous vein graft (SVG) disease. The company said
it plans to launch the product in the U.S. next week. The FilterWire EX system
is the first filter-based system approved for SVG treatment in the U.S., in
contrast to Medtronic's device, which temporarily occludes the vessel and uses
vacuum pressure to retrieve the particles.

In 2001, Boston Scientific was granted the CE mark in Europe for the FilterWire
EX Embolic Protection System for use in peripheral, coronary and carotid
vessels.

SVG disease occurs when saphenous veins harvested from the leg for use in
coronary artery bypass graft surgery develop atherosclerosis. The FilterWire EX
system is a low-profile embolic filter mounted on a guidewire that is designed
to reduce complications during balloon angioplasty and stenting procedures in
SVGs. It captures embolic material that becomes dislodged during cardiovascular
interventions. The debris captured by the filter would otherwise travel into the
microvasculature, where it could potentially cause a heart attack.

"Patients with degenerated saphenous vein grafts undergoing angioplasty and
stenting are at very high risk for complications," said Gregg Stone, MD, of
Lenox Hill Hospital (New York). "The availability of the FilterWire EX Embolic
Protection System is a major advance in our ability to safely treat these
patients."

Embolic protection has traditionally been addressed in two ways:
pharmaceutically, which generally impacts blood clotting but does not address
debris embolization, and with protection devices that actually capture debris.

"The FilterWire EX system demonstrates our continued commitment to providing
innovative solutions to tough clinical challenges," said Paul LaViolette, Boston
Scientific senior vice president and group president, Cardiovascular. "We are
pleased to offer clinicians this important device because of its potential for
preventing the severe complications associated with debris embolization."

Boston Scientific and Medtronic's devices are initially indicated for use in
saphenous vein grafts that have become occluded after coronary artery bypass
graft surgery.  However, it is believed that the ultimate market for these
devices may be expanded significantly with additional indications for use in
carotid artery stenting, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and other peripheral
vascular applications.

Tom Fleming, vice president of marketing for Embolic Protection, said that SVG
is an important introductory market for the company, but acknowledged that the
company has bigger plans for the system.

"It's [SVG] an area that's got a big need with MACE rates running in the 20%
range, so it's got a need but it's not the only area we've got an interest in,
Fleming told MDD. He said the company has an ongoing study for the use of the
device in carotid arteries in conjunction with the company's Carotid Wallstent
device. Additionally, he said the company is looking at the AMI area, "and will
probably be doing some feasibility work in that area as well."

Lawrence Keusch, an analyst for Goldman Sachs (New York), wrote in a research
report that his firms' clinical contacts "have expressed substantial interest in
the FilterWire, citing the ability to preserve bloodflow during the procedure
and the device's relative ease of use compared to Medtronic's GuardWire device."

However, while Keusch said this approval was an "incremental positive" for the
company's shares, the focus for investors and the driving force behind the
shares "clearly remains the status of the company's Taxus drug-eluting stent PMA
filing with the FDA," based on the results of the recently unblinded TAXUS IV
trial. He and several other analysts have said they feel very comfortable that
the trial has met its primary endpoint and expect an announcement of the PMA
filing within the next couple of weeks, with another analyst predicting a
possible announcement this Friday.

Boston Scientific also announced final results from its FIRE clinical trial,
which studied the FilterWire EX system. The objective of the trial was to
establish the safety and efficacy of the FilterWire EX system during balloon
angioplasty or stenting procedures in the treatment of SVGs.

The multi-center, randomized, controlled non-inferiority study compared the
FilterWire EX product to the PercuSurge GuardWire Plus System in a
non-inferiority (equivalence) trial that enrolled 651 patients at 55 U.S. (332
in FilterWire arm and 319 in the PercuSurge arm) sites and four sites in Canada.
The primary safety endpoint of the study was the cumulative incidence of Major
Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE) defined as death, Q-wave or non Q-wave myocardial
infarction, emergent coronary artery bypass surgery, or target vessel
revascularization at 30 days post-procedure.

The cumulative incidence of MACE at 30 days was 9.9% for patients receiving
treatment with the FilterWire EX system vs. 11.6% for patients receiving
treatment with the GuardWire Plus System. The results demonstrate that the
FilterWire EX system had equivalent clinical outcomes to the GuardWire Plus
System.

Although there was a numerical advantage for the FilterWire, the outcomes were
statistically equivalent, rather than superior, to the GuardWire.

"I think the advantage that we have is that one, we feel the device is a bit
easier to use in terms of just overall complexity, and the other is that it
allows contrast flow during the procedure, so you can really maintain the
visualization in blood flow for the patient," Fleming said.

At this time, neither the Medtronic nor Boston Scientific devices are eligible
for reimbursement. "Right now there is no reimbursement setup, so [the cost]
would be basically rolled into the money that would be coming in for the
procedure, you would be safe to use that to cover the costs," he added.

Study supports reduced CTA imaging for Powerlink patients

LENGTH: 1006 words

Medical Device Daily Senior Staff Writer

Patients treated for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) may be able to get away
with duplex ultrasound imaging as a long-term surveillance modality as opposed
to computed tomography angiography (CTA) if they are treated with the Powerlink
stent graft from Endologix (Irvine, California).

An independent core laboratory study that analyzed CTA scans of 1,519 patients
following endovascular aortic repair suggests that the first postoperative CTA
scan is of great value in defining a more benign follow-up imaging regimen such
as ultrasound. This would be a far less expensive imaging alternative, and would
significantly reduce the patient's imaging-related radiation exposure.

The study results are published online in the Journal of Vascular Surgery and
will be published in an upcoming issue of the journal, Endologix noted. The
study examined the long-term outcomes of 345 patients treated from July 2000 to
November 2007 in the pivotal, multicenter, prospective clinical trials of the
Powerlink system.

"This independent analysis of multicenter, prospective, core lab reviewed data
further establishes the long-term safety and durability of the Powerlink System
in the treatment of AAA, and represents a significant finding for our patients
and the physicians who treat them," said John McDermott, president/CEO of
Endologix.

"We believe these clinically-validated outcomes supporting the reduced use of
CTA scans in appropriate patients will benefit the continued health of patients
who receive the Powerlink stent graft. We also believe these outcomes have the
potential to substantially reduce the healthcare costs associated with the
imaging method and the associated complications," McDermott said.

The current protocol for patients who receive an endovascular graft to treat AAA
is an annual CT scan, he said. "The downside to that, of course, is a lot of
radiation as well as it is expensive. There is a fair amount of interest [in
finding] a less expensive, less radiation-intensive protocol that patients can
be put on," McDermott told Medical Device Daily.

In addition to lower costs and radiation exposure, McDermott said that
ultrasound is a "pretty benign follow-up" for the patient, much more convenient
than an annual CT scan would be.

"Although CTA is the current standard imaging modality for patients receiving an
endovascular stent graft, the medical community is becoming increasingly
concerned about its repeated use in patient follow-up due to the associated
cancer and renal toxicity risks," said Jeffrey Carpenter, MD, senior author of
the study and professor and chief of the Department of Surgery at UMDNJ-Robert
Wood Johnson Medical School at Camden (New Jersey). "Nonetheless, any practice
change from this paradigm must be supported by evidence-based outcomes. We were
pleased to find in our analysis of controlled trial data that for patients
receiving the Powerlink stent graft, the first CTA scan, typically within 30
days postoperatively, is of great value in defining a more benign follow-up
imaging regimen such as ultrasound. We have implemented this patient-centered
decision-making algorithm for our Powerlink patients to effectively reduce their
imaging-related exposure risks."

According to Endologix, the Powerlink system is a unibody self-expandable stent
graft for the endovascular repair of AAAs. The one-piece bifurcated design
features a fully supported ePTFE graft with a cobalt chromium alloy stent cage
for "outstanding" durability.

"What's different about the Powerlink device compared to all of the other
endovascular stent grafts is that all of the other devices . . . are attached to
the aorta through hooks or barbs or radial force, so they kind of hang there,"
McDermott said. "Our device sits on the patient's aortoiliac bifurcation. We
actually build from the bottom up . . . which gives it stability and clinical
outcomes."

According to the company the device's unibody design and fixation via anatomical
fixation at the patient's aortoiliac bifurcation closely mimics the patient's
original anatomy.

Earlier this year the company reported the publication of consolidated results
from its prospective, multicenter clinical trials of the company's Powerlink
stent graft for the endovascular repair of AAA using the anatomical fixation
technique.

The company said that the trial results demonstrate no aneurysm ruptures, no
conversions to open repair, no device migrations, no stent fractures, no graft
fatigue, no junctional endoleaks, no transgraft endoleaks, and 100% freedom from
aneurysm-related mortality for up to five years post-implant. In addition, core
lab evaluations found a low rate of limb occlusion (0.6% of limbs), with
significantly reduced or stable aneurysm sacs in 95% and 93% of patients at one
year and five years, respectively (Medical Device Daily, April 29, 2010).

That study reports the initial, mid-term, and available long-term results for
157 patients treated with the Powerlink system at 28 centers across the U.S. All
patients received the Powerlink infrarenal bifurcated stent graft via the
anatomical fixation technique, with concomitant proximal sealing achieved with a
Powerlink aortic extension as dictated by patient anatomical needs.

Just about a month ago Endologix received CE mark approval to market its
expanded offering of Powerlink stent graft products and PowerFit Aortic
Extensions in the European Union (MDD, Aug. 30, 2010).

The CE mark approval covers 31 new sizes of Powerlink main body bifurcated,
proximal extension, and limb extension stent grafts that increase the system's
addressable patient population by 5% to 10%. It also covers PowerFit Aortic
Extensions, which are available in a range of sizes indicated to treat aortic
necks ranging from 18 mm to 32 mm in diameter. In addition, the PowerFit product
line is available with longer stent lengths of up to 120 millimeters, to expand
the treatment options for physicians and their patients.

Additional Developments in One of Med-Tech's Key Sectors


Keeping you up to date in recent developments in orthopedics

Odds of successful grafts improved by new method of resurfacing bone . . .
Coating a bone graft with an inorganic compound found in bones and teeth may
significantly increase the likelihood of a successful implant, according to Penn
State researchers. Natural bone grafts need to be sterilized and processed with
chemicals and radiation before implantation into the body to ensure that disease
is not transmitted by the graft. Human bones have a rough surface. However, once
a graft is sterilized the surface changes and is not optimal for stimulating
bone formation in the body. "We created a method for resurfacing bone that had
been processed, and resurfacing that bone so that it is now nearly as osteogenic
as unprocessed bone - meaning it works nearly as well as bone that hadn't been
processed at all," said Henry J. Donahue, Michael and Myrtle Baker Professor of
Orthopaedics and Rehabilitation, Penn State College of Medicine (Hershey,
Pennsylvania). "That's the bottom line."

Donahue, who is also a faculty member of the Huck Institutes of the Life
Sciences, and Alayna Loiselle, postdoctoral fellow in orthopedics and
rehabilitation, Penn State College of Medicine, teamed up with Akhlesh
Lakhtakia, Charles Godfrey Binder Professor of Engineering Science and
Mechanics. They developed a way to create a rough surface on bone grafts that is
similar in texture to the surface of an untreated bone. This similarity promotes
healing in the bone. The researchers found that by coating a bone with the
inorganic compound hydroxyapatite, using physical vapor deposition, they could
closely mimic the rough surface of an untreated bone. To find the optimum
thickness of hydroxyapatite, Donahue and Loiselle sterilized the graft samples
in their lab at Penn State Hershey Medical Center. After sterilization, the
samples went to the University Park campus, where physical vapor deposition
layered different amounts of hydroxyapatite on the grafts. Then the samples were
returned to Hershey for Donahue and Loiselle to test. The researchers saw that
the optimum thickness of hydroxyapatite was in the middle of what they tested.
If the hydroxyapatite coating was not thick enough - or there was none - the
graft implant worked, but did not integrate as well as if there were a few
nanometers more layered onto the surface. If the hydroxyapatite was too thick,
the graft implant again worked, but did not integrate as well as the researchers
had seen was possible. "I thought we wouldn't need to coat the bone more than a
couple of hundred nanometers. As it turns out, it was much less than that," said
Lakhtakia. A hundred nanometers is about the size of a single virus. Fifteen
years ago Lakhtakia started an area called sculptured thin films. He thought
these might be used to heal broken bones, but wasn't sure how. He suggested that
for two bones to be joined, coating the two opposing faces with sculptured thin
film might bring them together. Bone is living tissue, so bone would grow
through the sculptured thin film and fuse together and create some sort of
adhesive bond. "When [Dr. Donahue] said he had this particular problem and asked
if I could do something about it, I thought about that," said Lakhtakia. "In 15
years or so, my understanding had considerably evolved, and the one thing that I
thought was that whatever needs to be done on the bone should not take too much
time and should be little in size. If it is little, there is a better chance of
integration inside the body - less foreign material inside the human body." The
researchers also believe this method could be used for soft musculoskeletal
tissue implants and orthopedic device implants. The researchers have filed a
provisional patent for this work.

Unnecessary knee arthroscopies still being performed? . . . Arthroscopy is still
commonly being performed on people with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee despite
evidence against the effectiveness of the surgical procedure for this condition,
according to research published in the October 1 issue of the Medical Journal of
Australia. Although the number of knee arthroscopies had declined overall, rates
had remained steady in those with osteoarthritis in the 9 years to 30 June 2009,
according to Dr Megan Bohensky from the Center of Research Excellence in Patient
Safety and coauthors, who studied usage patterns in Victorian hospitals.
According to the authors, research published 10 years ago and backed by
subsequent studies questions the benefit of knee arthroscopy in patients with
osteoarthritis. "Because arthroscopic procedures can be associated with
complications, it is important that they are used only when they are likely to
have measurable positive outcomes", the authors wrote. "Given the uncertain
evidence of effectiveness, general practitioners should encourage patients with
OA of the knee who have no evidence of major mechanical derangement to try
non-surgical treatments in the first instance", they wrote. In an accompanying
editorial, Professor Rachelle Buchbinder, director of Monash Department of
Clinical Epidemiology, Cabrini Health and Professor Ian Harris from the South
Western Sydney Clinical School, University of New South Wales wrote that it was
difficult to "shift the convictions of many surgeons." They wrote that in
contrast to new drugs, promising new surgical interventions continued to be
introduced into practice before their proper evaluation. "The use of arthroscopy
for knee osteoarthritis has been allowed to continue, exposing patients to an
intervention that is at best ineffective, and at worst, harmful", they wrote.

The effects of aging on muscles may be explained by inadequate cellular rest . .
. Is aging inevitable? What factors make older tissues in the human body less
able to maintain and repair themselves, as in the weakening and shrinkage of
aging muscles in humans? A new study from Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH;
Boston) investigators and collaborators at King's College London describes the
mechanism behind impaired muscle repair during aging and a strategy that may
help rejuvenate aging tissue by manipulating the environment in which muscle
stem cells reside. The report will appear in the journal Nature and has received
advance online release. Rare muscle stem cells are located inside each skeletal
muscle of the body. Also called satellite cells, due to their position on the
surface of the muscle fibers they serve and protect, these cells are essential
to maintaining the capacity of muscles to regenerate. Satellite cells are able
to generate new, differentiated muscle cells while keeping their identity as
stem cells, retaining the ability to maintain and repair muscle tissue. Normally
in a resting or dormant state, satellite cells respond rapidly to repair injured
tissues. The current study finds that aging muscle stem cells lose their ability
to maintain a dormant state, so that when called upon to repair injured muscle,
they are unable to mount an adequate response. Andrew Brack, PhD, of the MGH
Center for Regenerative Medicine, senior and corresponding author of the Nature
paper, says, "Just as it is important for athletes to build recovery time into
their training schedules, stem cells also need time to recuperate, but we found
that aged stem cells recuperate less often. We were surprised to find that the
events prior to muscle regeneration had a major influence on regenerative
potential. That makes sense to us as humans, in terms of the need to sleep and
to eat a healthy diet, but that the need to rest also plays out at the level of
stem cells is quite remarkable." An assistant professor of Medicine at Harvard
Medical School (Boston), Brack is also a principal faculty member at the Harvard
Stem Cell Institute. In a series of experiments in mice, the authors found that
a developmental protein called fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) is elevated in
the aging muscle stem cell microenvironment and drives stem cells out of the
dormant state. Satellite cells that are forced to replicate lose the ability to
maintain their identity as stem cells, reducing the stem cell population. The
authors also found that blocking the age-related increase in FGF signaling both
in aged satellite cells or in the cellular microenvironment protected against
stem cell loss, maintained stem cell renewal during aging and dramatically
improved the ability of aged muscle tissue to repair itself. Lead author Joe
Chakkalakal, PhD, a research fellow in Brack's lab, says, "This work highlights
the usefulness of targeting the aged stem cell or its environment to protect
stem cells and the tissues they serve from the effects of aging." Noting that
FGF2 is known for laying the foundation for muscle development, Brack adds, "At
present we don't know why this developmental factor is re-expressed in the aged
stem cell environment. It appears that what was beneficial for the development
of muscle becomes detrimental during aging. After this proof-of-principle study,
we are beginning to ask whether the lessons we have learned can be translated to
improving the health of the ever-growing aged human population."

Bolton opens new medical facility

Florida Governor Rick Scott was joined by CEO of Bolton Medical Solutions
(Sunrise, Florida) Oscar Rospigliosi, Sunrise Mayor Michael Ryan, and Greater
Fort Lauderdale Alliance CEO Bob Swindell to report the creation and retention
of over 100 jobs by Bolton Medical Solutions. Prior to the announcement, the
Governor toured the Bolton medical facility that is home to the production of
Relay Thoracic Stent-Grafts.

"Each job created or retained by Bolton Medical Solutions is another paycheck
for another Florida family. We are proud of the work that Bolton Medical is
doing here in Sunrise, both for the patients who lives depend on their devices
and the employees who work there. Creating an environment that encourages job
growth and business development is one of my priorities as Governor. While we
are not done, this is another step in the right direction," said Governor Scott.

The Relay Thoracic Stent-Graft is a life-saving technology offered to patients
with Thoracic Aortic Aneurysms. It is paired with the Plus Delivery System, a
four-step delivery device that allows surgeons to achieve a more satisfactory
placement of the stent-graft on a range of different patients. In addition, the
Relay Stent-Graft itself is specially designed to fit a range of sizes and
anatomical situations within the thoracic aorta.

BASKETBALL THUNDER;
Durant undergoes bone graft surgery on foot

BYLINE: CLIFF RUNT, The Associated Press

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. S4

LENGTH: 385 words

DATELINE: KLAHOMA CITY


Thunder star Kevin Durant had bone graft surgery Tuesday for a fracture in his
right foot, and the team expects he'll return to basketball activities in four
to six months.

The Thunder said in a statement that Durant had surgery at the Hospital for
Special Surgery in New York, with team medical staff present.

The league's reigning MVP had the third operation on his foot.

The first procedure was last October, and he returned to play in December with
some pain.

A screw rubbing against another bone was removed in February, and Durant was
expected to return in one or two weeks. The pain persisted, and Durant consulted
three foot and ankle specialists. They agreed to the bone graft surgery after it
was determined pain was from the rubbing, plus regression in the initial break.

Durant appeared in just 27 games this season, averaging 25.4 points, 6.6
rebounds and 4.1 assists.

Thunder coach Scott Brooks said Durant has been like an assistant coach
throughout the ordeal. He has been animated and involved on the sideline.

"It hasn't been easy on KD, but he has really established himself as a better
leader than ever, because when you're not playing, it's hard to stay locked in
and engaged on the team," Brooks said. "But he has done a great job of
continuing to communicate with our guys and help our guys along."

Oklahoma City is in position to reach the playoffs without Durant.

Heading into Tuesday night's games, the Thunder led New Orleans by 21/2 games in
the race for the No. 8 spot in the Western Conference standings with 10 games
left.

Brooks said he'll need Durant to motivate the team from the sideline.

"He knows the league as well as anybody on our team," Brooks said. "He knows the
players' tendencies as well as anybody on our team.

"He has to continue to relay those messages to the guys that are out there
playing, because he wants nothing but success for our guys, and that's what
leaders do."

The injuries continue to pile up for the Thunder. Brooks said forward Serge
Ibaka (right knee surgery), guard Andre Roberson (left ankle sprain) and forward
Nick Collison (left ankle sprain) are out for Wednesday's game against Dallas.
Ibaka isn't expected back during the regular season.

Guard Dion Waiters has soreness in his left foot. He sat out Tuesday's practice,
but he's expected to play Wednesday.

Novadaq's SPY system helps surgeons verify CABG patency

Novadaq's SPY system helps surgeons verify CABG patency

By HOLLAND JOHNSON Medical Device Daily Associate Managing Editor   El Camino
Hospital (Mountain View, California) became one on a growing list of hospitals
to benefit from a new technology that helps to confirm that a cardiac bypass
surgery operation has been as successful as possible, thereby avoiding possible
repeat heart surgery and reducing complications.

Traditionally, after bypass surgery, a doctor makes a calculated estimate about
whether newly created vessels are functioning properly, but doctors at El Camino
Hospital will now utilize this new technology to eliminate the guesswork.

The SPY intra-operative imaging system, developed by NovadaqTechnologies
(Toronto), is the first and only fluorescent imaging system cleared by the FDA
for use in coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, the most common
open-heart surgery in the country with about 400,000 patients undergoing the
procedure every year.

The system, which was cleared for use in the U.S. in January, uses an infrared
laser to stimulate a fluorescent imaging agent that has been injected into the
blood stream. Stimulation by this laser emits a light that can outline the
vessels and their attachments to the heart. The technique does not heat up heart
tissue and does not pose any risk to the patient or staff in the operating room.
The injected agent lights up blood, flowing through the veins and arteries in
real time, and the camera - which produces an ultra-high speed image at 30
frames per second - captures live images of the heart. These images can be
captured on a computer screen, saved and printed for medical reference.

"We can see flow and we can see artifacts that normal images cannot do," Novadaq
President and CEO Arun Menawat told Medical Device Daily, noting that his
company's technology does not compete with computed tomography or MRI, "because
we have to have a line of sight of some sort so that our products tend to be in
the operating room [OR]."

Prior to the development of the SPY system, Menawat said that a couple of other
methodologies have been used to determine the patency of a graft during surgery.
The first technique involves the use of X-ray, which he said works pretty well
because you can put a dye in the blood stream.

However, he noted that the problem with this technique in the OR is twofold.
First is that the procedure takes awhile to perform in the OR, and the patient's
posture has to be altered when the X-ray is performed. Secondly, the dye that is
used to visualize the X-ray is composed of heavy metal and is excreted by the
kidneys, which increases the risk of failure in that organ.

The other method that has been used involves ultrasound. Called Transit Time
Ultrasound Flow Measurement, this method employs a pen-like device that is
hooked up to an artery to measure flow rate at a particular location. The issue
with that technique is that the system only gives a reading at one point instead
of whether the entire heart is vascularized. "It's not about which arteries are
open," Menawat said, "it's really how well the heart is perfused with blood."

Marc Pelletier, MD, director of cardiac surgery at El Camino Hospital, was
instrumental in bringing this new technology, as he had previously utilized the
system at the University of Toronto.

"I feel that this is an important advance for our patients at El Camino Hospital
who are undergoing coronary bypass surgery," said Pelletier. "Now, we can
actually see how well blood is flowing through the new graft - something which
is not possible without this technology - in order to make any necessary
corrections during the operation. I'm hoping that this technology will help to
prevent complications or additional surgery that previously may have resulted
from bypass grafts not being technically perfect or having some other
unforeseeable problem with them. This gives us a critical and real-time ability
to assess the bypass grafts, during the operation."

The system enables cardiac surgeons to simply and efficiently confirm proper
placement of their bypass grafts and to visually assess the quality and
effectiveness of those grafts while the patient is still in the OR.

Without this new technique, surgeons previously have assumed that all the grafts
are perfect, but several reports suggest that 5% to 10% of them might have a
correctable problem. Traditionally, these have only been identified if the
patient becomes unstable or demonstrates signs of ongoing lack of blood flow to
the heart.

Menawat said that a recent study showed that nearly 30% patients who had a CABG
and were given an X-ray one year later had had at least one graft blocked.

It is hoped that use of this system may potentially reduce the number of
patients that must return to the operating room for the revision of improperly
functioning or potentially misplaced grafts.

While Menawat said that the blocked grafts may not have occurred during the
operation, it would be nice for surgeons to verify that blockages "did not
happen on the operating table."

Novadaq has an agreement with the Sorin Group's (Milan, Italy) CarboMedics unit
to distribute the SPY system in North America. The company's business model does
not involve direct purchase of the systems; rather, a hospital leases the
equipment and purchases the consumables used with the system.

Since September, when the company began selling the product in the U.S., Menawat
said it has placed about 15 systems and anticipates adding another 10 to that
total by the end of the year.

In addition to its cardiovascular program, the company, which was founded in
2000, is also developing an ophthalmic product called the OPTTX-2N1 system,
aimed at the diagnosis and treatment of the wet form of age-related macular
degeneration (AMD). This system uses the same core imaging technology that is
found in the SPY system.

The company also exclusively licensed intellectual property from Johns Hopkins
University (Baltimore) in 2001 for visually locating and treating abnormal blood
vessels in the eye found in patients with AMD. The ophthalmic device is
currently undergoing clinical trials.

New medical device removes large blood clot from patient's heart

SECTION: BLOOD PURIFICATION EQUIPMENT; Business Contractions

LENGTH: 380 words



HIGHLIGHT: Dr. Lee Butterfield M.D., interventional cardiologist with Palmetto
Cardiology in Columbia, South Carolina, was the first to use a new mechanical
thrombectomy (blood clot removal) system to extract a 1 inch long blood clot
from a saphenous vein to coronary artery bypass graft.


The patient presented with a long blood clot in an aged saphenous vein bypass
graft diagnosed during a cardiac catheterization procedure. Dr. Butterfield used
the combination of a protective filter, the new ASPIRE RX-LP6 Mechanical
Thrombectomy System, and a stent to remove blood clots and dilate the stenosis.



"Compromised bypass grafts may include long viscous blood clots and emboli
making them particularly difficult to treat," said Lee Butterfield, MD with
Palmetto Cardiology. "The ASPIRE RX-LP6 System allowed us to create continuous
thrombectomy force and remove a long blood clot from the patient's vein graft.
Once the blood clot was removed, we could better define a culprit lesion and
deploy a 3.5mm diameter stent."

The ASPIRE Systems allow clinicians to instantly start, stop, increase,
decrease, pulse, or maintain thrombectomy force during the procedure. ASPIRE
Mechanical Aspirators also aspirate up to 280ml, almost 10 times more than basic
syringe systems, without multiple messy and time-consuming catheter connections,
disconnections, and re-connections.

"The ASPIRE RX-LP6 Mechanical Thrombectomy System is a natural extension to the
successful ASPIRE platform," said Shawn Fojtik, CEO of Control Medical
Technology. "Thousands of ASPIREs have been sold and used in procedures from the
ankle to the elbow. Adding FDA cleared coronary thrombectomy catheters allows
clinicians to bring high-performance mechanical thrombectomy to the heart and
improve patient care."

The patented ASPIRE RX-LP6 Mechanical Thrombectomy System includes an ASPIRE
Mechanical Aspirator (drive unit/pump) and a low-profile rapid-exchange (RX)
thrombectomy catheter. ASPIRE Mechanical Aspirators are also available alone and
may be connected to any thrombectomy catheter the clinician chooses to use.
Control Medical also manufactures ASPIRE MAX Mechanical Thrombectomy Systems
with larger over-the-wire (OTW) thrombectomy catheters for use in the peripheral
vasculature.

Control Medical Technology designs, develops, and markets innovative thrombus
(blood clot) management, biopsy, and aspiration devices, including the patented
ASPIRE Mechanical Aspirator, ASPIRE RX-LP6 Mechanical Thrombectomy System, and
ASPIRE MAX Thrombectomy System, and other devices to improve patient care.

Product Briefs

· Epix Medical (Cambridge, Massachusetts) said that the results of a Phase II
MS-325 clinical trial have been published in the December issue of Radiology.
MS-325, a contrast agent designed specifically for vascular imaging with
magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), is being co-developed by Epix and Schering
AG (Berlin, Germany). The Phase II clinical study of MS-325-enhanced MRA in the
aortoiliac arteries was designed to compare the diagnostic accuracy of
MS-325-enhanced MRA and unenhanced MRA with that of X-ray angiography. In the
study, 238 patients were randomly assigned to receive either a placebo or
MS-325, at one of five test doses. The paper concluded that a dose of 0.03
mmol/kg of MS-325 was safe and effective for evaluation of aortoiliac disease
with MRA. Epix said it previously reported these results in December 2001.

· Itamar Medical (Cessaria, Israel) said that its new product, the Watch PAT
(peripheral arterial tone) allows patients suffering from obstructive sleep
apnea to be tested unattended in the natural sleep environment of their own
homes. The company said the portable system is patient-friendly, compact in size
and nonintrusive. Nothing more than an index finger probe, which is held in
place by a forearm splint, is worn by the patient, to ensure a normal night's
rest. During the night, the Watch PAT records respiratory disturbance indices,
oxygen saturation and desaturation values, actigraphy measurements and heart
rate values and changes. The next morning, the patient returns the Watch PAT to
their physician's office. Test results are known within a few minutes through a
simple download into the practice's computer.

· Kensey Nash (Exton, Pennsylvania) has received CE mark approval for the new
TriActiv FX Balloon Protected Flush Extraction System. The system is designed to
prevent heart attacks during the interventional treatment of saphenous vein
grafts in patients who previously received coronary bypass surgery, but now have
blockages in the grafts. The device incorporates a protection balloon guidewire
that creates a protected space, a flush catheter that washes the graft, and an
extraction system that removes the debris found in the graft. These three
features work in combination to prevent the debris found in the graft from going
downstream and potentially causing a heart attack.

· MindGuard (Caesarea, Israel) reported that its Diverter flagship, a stent-like
device, was implanted in a human on Oct. 1. The e-DIRECT (Embolic DIversion and
Rerouting to the External Carotid Technique) is intended to reduce the
occurrence of strokes by diverting clots and thrombotic particles away from the
brain into a non-hazardous location. The e-DIRECT procedure involves threading a
catheter into the carotid bifurcation and deployment of a tubular mesh in the
carotid bifurcation, with the intention of protecting the brain from the harmful
emboli. This minimally invasive procedure is similar to the currently existing
deployment of an endovascular stent, with short procedural time and low
complication rate.

· Sorin Biomedica (Sallugia, Italy) said its InPeria Carbostent - the only stent
approved for endovascular procedures in below-the-knee arteries - has been the
subject of a preliminary clinical study involving the treatment with angioplasty
of a group of patients with a high incidence of diabetes. After one year of
follow up, the patients treated with a stent showed a marked improvement in
vessel perviety. This multi-center pilot randomized study demonstrated
significant long-term clinical results in the reduction of the degree of
claudication. The use of the InPeria stent in the treatment of infrapopliteal
occlusions produced better results in improving the conditions of the lower
limbs than traditional treatment methods, the company said.

· St. Jude Medical (St. Paul, Minnesota) provided an update on the status of its
planned regulatory filings to the FDA for the RHYTHM (Resynchronization
Hemodynamic Treatment for Heart Failure Management) implantable cardioverter
defibrillator (ICD) study. The RHYTHM ICD study is a multiphase premarket
approval trial, including an initial on/off randomized phase studying the St.
Jude Medical Epic HF ICD with the Aescula 1055K stylet driven lead system in
heart failure patients; a second phase which studies the Quicksite1056K
over-the-wire lead system; and a third phase which studies the programmable V-V
timing feature of this product line. In order to incorporate the clinical data
for the Quicksite 1056K lead into this submission, the company said it plans to
submit its filing to the FDA the week of Dec. 15.

Durant to Have Bone Graft and Miss Rest of Season

BYLINE: By SCOTT CACCIOLA

SECTION: Section D; Column 0; Sports Desk; N.B.A. ROUNDUP; Pg. 6

LENGTH: 606 words


Kevin Durant, the N.B.A.'s reigning most valuable player, has played his final
game of an injury-marred season. Durant is scheduled to undergo a bone graft
next week on his ailing right foot, the team announced Friday, and is not
expected to resume basketball-related activities for four to six months.

It will be the third surgical procedure on Durant's right foot this season, a
worrisome development for one of the league's most dynamic scorers -- and for
the Thunder, who are vying for a playoff spot in the Western Conference. The
Thunder, who are 41-31 and increasingly reliant on Russell Westbrook, are in
eighth place, which would set up a first-round meeting with the Golden State
Warriors, who currently lead the conference.

Durant, 26, appeared in just 27 games this season, averaging 25.4 points, 6.6
rebounds and 4.1 assists.

Durant initially had surgery after breaking a bone in his right foot in the
preseason. Last month, he had an additional procedure to replace a screw that
was causing discomfort in his foot. At the time, Coach Scott Brooks expressed
optimism that Durant would return to the lineup.

But as a result of what the team described as persistent soreness, Durant and
team personnel consulted two specialists in the past week: Dr. Martin O'Malley
in New York and Dr. James Nunley at Duke University. It was determined, General
Manager Sam Presti said in a news release, that the fracture of Durant's fifth
metatarsal was ''demonstrating signs of regression'' and that additional surgery
was necessary.

A bone graft is standard procedure in the rare instances when these types of
fracture operations are unsuccessful, Presti said. O'Malley will perform the
procedure.

''While everyone is disappointed that Kevin falls into that group, we are
encouraged that the bone graft procedure has historically demonstrated long-term
health and stability,'' Presti said in the release.

Steve Kerr, the coach of the Warriors, said the news came as a blow.

''I always hate hearing when anybody gets injured and is out, especially someone
like Kevin, who is so good for the league and gracious and such an incredible
example for the league,'' Kerr said. ''''

Durant's contract with the Thunder runs through next season.

Medical device company Medtronic agrees to settle $22 million suit in bone graft
drug case

BYLINE: By Alexis Harrison

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 468  words


Med-tech giant Medtronic has agreed to pay $22 million to settle a lawsuit
related to a controversial bone-growth product. The product, INFUSE, has been
the target of of legal action but despite looming lawsuits and the recent
settlement, Minneapolis-based Medtronic says it still stands behind the bone
graft product.

According to the Wall Street Journal, some law firms have advised Medtronic that
they may bring a large number of similar claims against the company in the
future. The company estimates those law firms represent approximately 2,600
additional unfiled claimants. The majority of these cases are still in the early
procedural stages and none have resulted in a finding of liability against
Medtronic.

On May 6, the  company announced the settlement resolves the claims of about 950
patients. Earlier, just a day ahead the trial and following several days of
pretrial motions, a California trial judge entered summary judgment in favor of
Medtronic in the first INFUSE bone graft case scheduled to go to trial.

The company is not admitting any liability in the case, and according to a
Medtronic statement, the company "continues to stand behind INFUSE Bone Graft."
The  product was developed and sold by Medtronic's Memphis-based spinal
division.

According to  Twin Cities Business magazine, Medtronic's INFUSE is a genetically
modified version of a naturally occurring protein that encourages the fast
growth of bone. Back in 2002, the Food and Drug Administration approved the drug
for specific uses including a certain type of back surgery, and it was lauded as
a "game changer."

However, it seemed to have adverse effects, and unwanted bone growth caused pain
and complications in some of the users. In 2011, medical publication The Spine
Journal reported that the issues had not been reported in clinical research.
Bizjournals.com reports that in 2013, Medtronic released the results of a
third-party independent review of INFUSE that was performed by Yale University
researchers. The two-year study included data from spinal clinical trials
involving more 2,000 patients. Just a small number of patients developed cancer
but neither the company nor the study found any definitive links to the drug.

Meanwhile, Medtronic anticipates it will take a special charge in the range of
$120 - $140 million in its recently completed fourth quarter under the
guidelines of SEC. This charge accounts for the $22 million settlement announced
on Tuesday, and certain costs associated with these settlements.

Philippines top cop faces graft, plunder charges

LENGTH: 282  words


Manolo B. Jara

MANILA

Plunder and graft charges have been filed before the office of the Ombudsman
against the chief of the Philippine National Police (PNP) for allegedly amassing
unexplained wealth and for receiving bribes for the construction of a mansion
inside the PNP national headquarters in Metro Manila.



Named in the criminal complaints filed by the Coalition of Filipino Consumers
(CFC) was Director General Alan Purisima, the PNP chief, widely acknowledged as
a close ally of President Benigno 'Noynoy' Aquino and the cousin of Secretary
Cesar Purisima of the Department of Finance.

The complaints filed before Ombudsman Conchita Carpio-Morales, a retired Supreme
Court justice and the country's chief graft-buster, alleged that Purisima
enriched himself while in office including a mansion which was constructed in a
town of Nueva Ecija province in Central Luzon.

Purisima was also accused of graft and bribery for allegedly receiving money and
building materials from his Mason brothers for the construction of a mansion
inside the PNP national headquarters in suburban Quezon City, Metro Manila.

Aquino welcomed the filing of the charges and his other allies believed to have
been dishonest while serving in the government.

"The cards are open if they think I have dishonest people around me. All they
have to do is to file the appropriate charges," Aquino told a forum organised by
the Harvard University in Boston, where he was on official visit.

"The Ombudsman, in particular, even investigates instances where complaints are
unsigned or anonymous precisely to ferret out and pinpoint those who are not
treading the correct path, Aquino said."

Ovary transplants 'delay menopause and having babies'

BYLINE: Jenny Hope

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 21

LENGTH: 600 words


WOMEN could delay having babies and the menopause with an ovary transplant,
according to the surgeon who carried out the first such operation.

Similar techniques are currently used to save the ovaries of those being treated
for cancer, but Dr Sherman Silber predicted transplants or grafts for social
reasons were a realistic option for preserving fertility.

In 2007, the US microsurgeon transplanted an ovary from one adult twin to
another who had become infertile. The following year, the 38-year-old transplant
recipient gave birth.

Transplanting ovaries or ovarian tissue is currently used to help women and
girls undergoing cancer treatment to preserve their fertility.

The drugs used to treat cancer may destroy ovaries, so slices of tissue are
taken in advance and frozen. They can be re-implanted when the woman is ready to
start a family.

So far, 22 women have given birth after having their ovarian tissue restored.
The latest success was achieved in Italy seven years after a 21-year-old woman
had ovarian tissue frozen before cancer treatment. Details were released at the
annual meeting of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology in
Istanbul, Turkey.

Dr Silber, who works at the Infertility Centre of Saint Louis, Missouri,
presented data on three women who had frozen and thawed ovary grafts and nine
who had fresh ovary grafts, usually donated by relatives.

One woman had ovarian tissue implanted to treat premature menopause caused by
cancer drugs, while another had a graft to treat a naturally premature
menopause.

Eight babies have been born in total to the women, with one graft lasting seven
years so far.

Dr Silber said: 'Transplanted ovarian tissue can robustly restore menstrual
cycles and fertility, and may even in the future be used to postpone the normal
time of menopause or to alleviate its symptoms.'

In 2008, he predicted women who had an ovary frozen in their 20s could look
forward to the best of all worlds. 'A young ovary can be transplanted back at
any time and it will extend fertility and delay the menopause. You could even
wait until you were 47,' he said.

However, Professor Nick Macklon, medical director of the Complete Fertility
Centre, Southampton, said freezing ovarian tissue for social reasons raised
ethical issues that would need to be debated by society as well as doctors.

FROZEN EMBRYOS BOOST CHANCES

WOMEN having fertility treatment using a frozen embryo have a 30 per cent higher
chance of getting pregnant than those using fresh ones, a study has found.

Freezing allows couples to have several cycles of IVF with eggs collected during
one round of treatment. By putting some on ice, couples can use up their fresh
embryos before moving on to frozen ones at a later date.

But the study suggests there are advantages to waiting for the womb to settle
down after drug treatment before using frozen embryos.

Spanish researchers said it would soon be possible to recommend that all embryos
used in IVF were frozen first. The study was presented at the annual meeting of
the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology in Turkey.

Professor Miguel Angel Checa from the Hospital Universitari del Mar in
Barcelona, who led the study, said the drug treatment needed to produce multiple
eggs affected the receptivity of the lining of the womb, making it less likely
that a transferred embryo would implant.

Women having embryos implanted straight after drug treatment ran the risk of
ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, which can lead to death. Some 316 women
participated in the study.

Kensey Nash gets grant for vascular graft development

Kensey Nash (Exton, Pennsylvania) said it has received a $1.9 million award
through the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) ATP program
for a three-year effort to develop a synthetic small-diameter vascular graft.

In collaboration with the Washington University School of Medicine (St. Louis,
Missouri) and the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (Washington), the company
will research and develop a 3-D porous scaffold composed of multiple
biomaterials designed to mimic the appropriate biomechanical properties of a
natural vessel with the intent to ultimately regenerate a functioning artery.
The award is structured to support this program over a three-year period.

The project is based on an advanced technology platform under development at
Kensey Nash enabling the integration of biomaterials and biologically active
agents into a single tissue-engineered devices which can be designed to imitate
the physiological characteristics of tissue providing a platform for arterial
regeneration.

Kensey Nash is also in the second year of a three-year $1.2 million ATP grant
project to develop an implant for articular cartilage repair and regeneration.

Stand ready for federal inquiry, Jacobs tells staff

BYLINE: Ignazio Messina, The Blade, Toledo, Ohio

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 633 words


Sept. 22--Dr. Lloyd Jacobs, University of Toledo Medical Center president,
called on all of the institution's employees to stand ready for intense scrutiny
coming soon from a federal agency investigating an error that led to a botched
kidney surgery last month.

Dr. Jacobs, speaking Friday to employees at a town hall meeting that was
streamed online live, said the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services would
be undertaking an exhaustive review of the entire facility.

The examination is being made after an Aug. 10 surgery during which a usable
kidney was discarded before it could be transplanted into the donor's sister.
UTMC's live kidney-donor program was voluntarily suspended after the incident.

"At this point, nobody disputes what happened," he said. "What we really need to
do is see if there's any way to practice the principles of continuous
improvement -- continuous quality improvement -- as it relates to protocols,
policies, and procedures ... those are the things that create safeguards."

He said the imminent review would feel like a joint commission survey.

"This is every aspect of the institution. From Kobacker [Center] to outpatient
needs to be ready for a major survey," Dr. Jacobs said.

Dr. Jeffrey Gold, chancellor and vice president for biosciences and health
affairs at UTMC, the former Medical College of Ohio, appeared Friday with Dr.
Jacobs.

Dr. Gold said the hospital's kidney-transplant program has a history of
excellence and success. He also clarified details contained in reports from the
Ohio Department of Health that showed UTMC was cited for violating state
standards over the last decade, including one report that said it had a
lower-than-average survival rate for kidney transplants during a period of time.

The Ohio Department of Health -- which is part of the current investigation --
has conducted several reviews at the hospital over the last decade, records
show. In October, 2010, the state health department did a survey of the
hospital's kidney-transplant program based on findings by the Scientific
Registry of Transplant Recipients, which "revealed that the actual one-year
graft [transplant] survival rate was significantly lower than expected for
patients transplanted between Jan. 1, 2007, and June 30, 2009." The state's
report found "the expected number of graft failures was 13; the actual number of
graft failures was 22."

Dr. Gold said graft survival refers to the organ that was transplanted. Six out
of the 22 patients died at some point and the others went back to other methods
like dialysis after kidney graft failure.

He said the UTMC graft survival average last year was "far superior to any
national average."

"This is a long-standing, highly excellent program that has taken risks for
patients, for donors, and for recipients since its inception over 40 years ago,"
Dr. Gold said.

The medical center hired Dr. Marlon Levy, surgical director, transplantation, at
Baylor All Saints Medical Center at Fort Worth, to "review the policies,
procedures, and practices of UTMC's living related donor program" and to review
management of patients undergoing living related transplants.

Dr. Levy's report on the program has been completed and UTMC officials are
weighing requests from media organizations to release that document.

Dr. Jacobs said the report from Dr. Levy found that the Aug. 10 kidney surgery
was an isolated incident and not characteristic of the medical center's culture
of safety.

Regarding the voluntary suspension of the live-kidney donor program, Dr. Jacobs
has said previously he has no doubt it would be restarted after reviews.

to market the company's orthopedic picture archiving and communications system
(PACS) software, echoeSYSTEM. Medstrat said echoeSYSTEM PACS users view
patients' radiological studies on workstations locally or across computer
networks at widely distributed locations, including on a practice's intranet or
remotely via extranet or Internet connections. echoeSYSTEM PACS automates
offsite data backup for disaster recovery of archives and simplifies HIPAA
conformance by practices, the company said. It said the application allows
orthopedic specialists and sub-specialists to "readily collaborate on
complicated decisions while avoiding extra office visits by patients or
physicians, thus improving the quality and efficiency of clinical practices."
The echoeSYSTEM workstation software, echoeSTATION, allows user access from
virtually any network-accessible PC.

· Alliance Medical (Phoenix, Arizona) said that the FDA has cleared its 510(k)
request for additional Cordis Webster IVC unipolar and fixed curve
electrophysiology (EP) catheters and cables. Alliance said it now can reprocess
almost all unique models of diagnostic EP catheters from all major
manufacturers. Alliance said its engineers and independent national laboratories
performed extensive testing and re-testing to validate that these reprocessed
Cordis Webster IVC EP catheters and cables will be clean, sterile and
pyrogen-free when they are returned to hospitals.

· Cardima (Fremont, California) reported the first commercial clinical use with
the company's Revelation Helix STX 2.5 or "large loop" version of the Revelation
Helix for the treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) originating in the pulmonary
veins. On Aug. 6, Dr. Ali Erdogan of Justus-Liebig-Universitat (Giessen,
Germany) performed the first procedure on an AF patient using the STX 2.5
catheter. Commenting on the relative ease and success of the procedure, Erdogan
said, "After only one ablation round, there was an approximately 60% to 70%
reduction of signals. I am impressed with the optimal signal reduction and the
remarkable signal span during the ablation." The Revelation Helix STX 2.5 used
in the procedure provides a larger loop diameter to enable more effective
ablation within larger diameter pulmonary veins or ablation at the pulmonary
vein-left atrium junctions. Additional new features that distinguish it from the
current line of Cardima products includes 16 short (3 mm in length), fine wire
electrodes that allow for greater radial hoop pressure, better tissue contact
and an enhanced current density effect.

· CardioTech International (Woburn, Massachusetts) reported that a 68-year-old
female diabetic is alive and well after implantation of its CardioPass synthetic
coronary artery bypass graft. On Aug. 6, Dr. Ivo Nesralla, professor of cardiac
surgery at the Instituto da Cardiologia do Rio Grande do Sul (Porto Alegre,
Brazil), performed the procedure. Nesralla said that the surgery went smoothly
and the graft was easily sutured.  He also reported that the patient is expected
to leave the hospital and return home soon. The patient was diagnosed in very
poor condition and considered a "re-do" patient, as she had no useable mammary
artery. Both her right coronary artery and the left descending artery were
reoccluded. The doctor used a saphenous vein graft on her right coronary artery
and the CardioPass patented synthetic coronary artery bypass graft on her left
anterior descending coronary artery.

· Digene (Gaithersburg, Maryland) said that Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings
(LabCorp; Burlington, North Carolina) is now offering clients Digene's
DNAwithPap Test for cervical cancer screening and cervical disease
identification. The DNAwithPap Test is based on the hc2 High-Risk HPV DNA Test
and is FDA-approved for women age 30 and older to adjunctively screen with a Pap
test to assess the presence or absence of high-risk HPV types as a guide for
patient management.

· Masimo (Irvine, California), a developer of motion and low-perfusion tolerant
pulse oximetry, reported the publication of a study in the March issue of
Pediatrics indicating pulse oximetry as a useful diagnostic device in screening
infants for congenital heart disease. The researchers conclude that a program of
pulse oximetry screening of asymptomatic newborns for critical congenital
cardiovascular malformation enables the detection of these life-threatening
conditions prior to hospital discharge.

· Spectranetics (Colorado Springs, Colorado) said the FDA has set Oct. 2 as the
date for a Circulatory System Devices Advisory Panel review of the company's
premarket approval supplement based on its LACI (Laser Angioplasty to treat
Critical Limb Ischemia) pivotal trial. The LACI trial showed that critical limb
ischemia patients who were poor surgical candidates can be successfully treated
with laser assisted therapy. The primary endpoint of six-month survival with
limb salvage was achieved in 93% of the limbs treated, compared with 87% in the
control group. Surgery was performed in 2% of the LACI group compared with 34%
in the control group.

· Ventracor (Sydney, Australia) said that medical investigators in Australia
have provided a progress report on the clinical trial of its left ventricular
assist system (LVAS) at The Alfred Hospital (Melbourne, Australia). The
VentrAssist is a third-generation LVAS with a design that features only one
moving part, a hydrodynamically suspended impeller. The patient who received the
first implant of the VentrAssist on June 28 was discharged home from the
hospital on Tuesday. The Pilot Trial evaluates the safety of the VentrAssist
LVAS in up to 10 patients suffering end-stage congestive heart failure.

· CryoLife (Kennesaw, Georgia) said a patient has received the first
Cryopreserved osteoarticular (OA) allograft transplant for resurfacing articular
cartilage in the knee. The OA allograft is a section of bone with overlying
cartilage derived from the end of the femur, in this case from the femoral
condyle. Dr. Philip Davidson, of Tampa Bay Orthopaedic Specialists (St.
Petersburg, Florida), performed the surgery. "Prior to this new cryopreservation
technology, OA grafts had limited shelf-life and were generally made available
for implant with less than two weeks before expiration," he said. "More patients
can benefit from these precious grafts as cryopreservation allows for enhanced
logistics, improved availability and optimal size and shape matching of these
grafts." Steven Anderson, president and CEO of CryoLife, said the Cryopreserved
OA allografts can be stored and used for up to two years, "which permits
CryoLife to perform a complete review of the donor's medical history, including
an autopsy report and the results of exhaustive testing on the donor's tissues
prior to making these tissues available for implantation."

· LION bioscience (Heidelberg, Germany) said it has partnered with HP (Palo
Alto, California) to extend its range of Linux-supported platforms for SRS to
the life sciences. LION will optimize its SRS technology to take advantage of
the speed of HP Integrity servers. With the launch of SRS 8.1 this month, SRS
will support the HP Integrity Linux platform based on 64-bit Intel Itanium2
processors.

Let's look at old-fashioned honest graft

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 8

LENGTH: 568 words


The response of Kathryn Jean Lopez (National Review Online) to the arrest of Rod
Blagojevich was priceless. "Finally, a political scandal you can talk to your
children about. No room at the Mayflower. No MySpace page. No Gay-American
announcement. Just good and evil and money and power corrupting." Rod
Blagojevich is part of a storied American tradition. If he was selling
government posts, shaking down businesses and maneuvering to get lucrative jobs
for his wife and himself, Blagojevich was practicing "honest graft."

The distinction between "honest graft" and "dishonest graft" was elucidated by
turn-of the-century politico George Washington Plunkitt, a Tammany Hall man.
Tammany was the political machine that ran New York, which was a lot like
Illinois is today. "Everybody is talkin' these days about Tammany men growin'
rich on graft, but nobody thinks of drawin' the distinction between honest graft
and dishonest graft ... Yes, many of our men have grown rich in politics ...
I've made a big fortune out of the game ... but I've not gone in for dishonest
graft -- blackmailin' gamblers, saloonkeepers, disorderly people, etc."

No, he explained, here's how honest graft works: "I'm tipped off, say, that
they're going to lay out a new park at a certain place. I see my opportunity and
I take it. I go to that place and I buy up all the land I can in the
neighborhood. Then the board of this or that makes its plan public, and there is
a rush to get my land, which nobody cared particular for before. Ain't it
perfectly honest to charge a good price and make a profit on my investment and
foresight? ... Well, that's honest graft."

How is it done today? Gov. Blagojevich, who had authority to appoint a successor
to the U.S. Senate seat vacated by Barack Obama, instructs his aide that "The
trick is ... how do you conduct indirectly ... a negotiation?" Actually, on the
evidence of these secretly taped conversations, Blagojevich was anything but
indirect.

Seeing himself in possession of a valuable commodity, Blagojevich wasn't about
to give it away for mere gratitude. "It's not coming for free. ... I've got this
thing and it's (expletive) golden, and, uh, uh, I'm just not giving it up for
(expletive) nothing. I'm not gonna do it." Then, demonstrating an appreciation
for his legal authority, he said, "I can always use it. I can parachute me
there." At another point, he was subtlety itself: "I want to make money."

Plunkitt had some other reflections on public service. He noted that "What tells
in holdin' your grip on your district is to go right down among the poor
families and help them in the different ways they need help ... If there's a
fire in Ninth, Tenth, or 11th Avenue, for example, any hour of the day or night,
I'm usually there with some of my election district captains as soon as the fire
engines. If a family is burned out I don't ask whether they are Republicans or
Democrats, and I don't refer them to the Charity Organization Society... I just
get quarters for them, buy clothes for them ... and fix them up till they get
things runnin' again. It's philanthropy, but it's politics, too ... Who can tell
how many votes one of these fires bring me? The poor are the most grateful
people in the world, and, let me tell you, they have more friends in their
neighborhoods than the rich have in theirs."

On second thought, Blagojevich wouldn't be fit to shine Plunkitt's shoes.

Dealerships' loss trickles down to communities

BYLINE: Robin Acton

LENGTH: 1104 words


For years, Scottdale car dealer Douglas Graft sponsored soccer teams, baseball
leagues and local charities as a way to give back to the community.

That all came to an end this spring when Chrysler dropped Graft
Chrysler-Dodge-Jeep in a bankruptcy restructuring plan that eliminated 789 of
its 3,200 U.S. dealerships.

"We used to try to do as many sponsorships as we could," said Graft, who laid
off three employees and revamped the business to offer only used cars and repair
work. "We've totally cut it out now. I know it definitely hurt the community,
but we had no choice."

Communities across the nation will lose valuable sources of charitable giving
when Michigan-based Chrysler LLC and General Motors combined close more than
3,000 dealerships by the end of next year. Pennsylvania, which will lose more
than 140 dealerships, is hardest hit among the 50 states.

The National Automobile Dealers Association said communities everywhere depend
upon car dealerships -- often a town's largest employer -- for everything from
sales tax and property tax collections to newspaper and television advertising
to charitable donations. The ripple effect from dealership closings will trickle
down to the most basic levels in local economies, according to the association.

"The average dealership employs 50 people, so do the math. In addition to job
losses, there's a big impact on the state budget with the loss of sales tax
revenue," said Clarence B. Smail Jr., president of Honda Village in Greensburg,
who represents 500 Western Pennsylvania car dealers on the NADA board.

The Chrysler dealerships closed in recent months, and General Motors said it
would eliminate about 2,400 dealerships by October. Already, youth sports teams
and nonprofit groups are feeling the blow.

Patty Hettich, treasurer of Freeport Area Little League, said the league's 13
teams counted car dealers among its business sponsors in years past, but
received no money from dealerships this year to cover expenses for field
maintenance and uniforms. She said league officials realized the sagging economy
would cut into their budget, so they lowered sponsorship fees from $150 to $125
per team.

"We knew going in that it was going to be hard to get sponsors," she said. "We
have approached car dealers, but didn't get anything from them."

'A spoke on a wheel'

The Pittsburgh Automobile Trade Association, in a 2004 study, reported that 302
franchised automobile dealerships in the Pittsburgh area employed 13,288 people
with an additional 8,371 jobs generated from indirect economic impacts. In 2003,
with an average dealership payroll of more than $2.1 million, dealerships had
more than $8.6 billion in sales, collected or paid more than $321 million in
state and local taxes and spent more than $123 million on advertising, the
association reported.

Collectively, those dealerships contributed more than $5 million to charitable
causes, the study revealed.

Michael W. Lieberth, general manager of Lieberth & Sons Dodge in Oakmont,
compared auto dealerships to "a spoke on a wheel" that keeps the local economy
going. Now that Chrysler put his dealership's new car franchise out of business
and reduced its ability to generate revenue, Lieberth & Sons will not be able to
donate to local groups.

"We used to donate to booster clubs and Oakmont's beautification project, but we
won't be participating in that anymore," said Lieberth, who said the business
will rely on its established customer base and repair work.

Donations important

As car dealers disappear, those that remain say they are inundated with requests
for help from sports teams and nonprofit groups.

Jamie Morabito, owner of Morabito Motors in Lower Burrell, said he gets at least
10 requests for donations each week for help with everything from beauty
pageants to wrestling teams to girls' softball leagues.

"It's overwhelming sometimes, but you have to pick and choose," said Morabito,
who has cut his contributions by 50 percent in the last five years.

Morabito, the father of a 12-year-old son who plays baseball and a 15-year-old
daughter who is a cheerleader, knows how important donations are to youth and
civic groups. Each year, he uses several thousand dollars from his advertising
budget to buy team shirts and meet other needs for local organizations by
supporting golf outings, cancer benefits and other events.

"Contributions are down, there's no doubt about it, because patrons just do not
have the extra funds," he said. "You'll see it more so as dealers go out of
business and others tighten up their budgets."

Chester "Bo" Corwin Jr., owner of Corwin Jeep Sales & Service on Route 50 in
Hickory, said the 65-year-old dealership is the oldest Jeep dealer in the
country. He held a Chrysler franchise until the company shut it down in the
restructuring.

For years, sports teams, choirs, Scout troops and homecoming queen candidates
knew they could count on the dealership's help with fundraisers, he said.

Frank Hnat, a 25-year member of the Hickory Lions Club, said the service
organization often called on Corwin's dealership for help with projects,
including Hickory's Main Street Revitalization Project and a memorial garden
honoring a deceased member.

"He's been faithful to us over the years. It's surely a loss," Hnat said.

Corwin, who has been selling cars for four decades, is among dealers lobbying
Congress to pass federal legislation that would overturn the automakers' plans
and reinstate franchises. The Automobile Dealer Economic Rights Restoration Act
of 2009 could come before the full House as early as this week, he said.

Loyalty matters

Chrysler and General Motors, faced with sagging sales in a weak economy, say
they are trying to consolidate operations by making cuts necessary to survival.

Nevertheless, Corwin insists dealership closings don't make sense because the
owners have a "tremendous amount of money" invested in franchises. Local
dealerships, he said, cost the company nothing because the owners must pay
automakers for everything.

"It only hurts the local customers who have to drive 20 or 30 miles for warranty
work now. We're not going to set any sales records, but we've got loyalty,"
Corwin said.

Although he cut back on his sponsorship budget in recent years, Corwin estimated
at one time he spent at least $10,000 and sometimes $15,000 a year to support
nonprofit organizations. With the loss of his Chrysler franchise, that
sponsorship money dried up, he said.

"It's too bad because it's affecting the kids," Corwin said. "It used to be $350
for this, $250 for that, but it's all gone away.

"We can't just can't do it anymore."

Medtronic bone graft suit isn't preempted, rules California trial court

BYLINE: Pat Murphy

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 308  words


Federal law does not preempt a product liability suit brought by a woman who
claimed she suffered injuries as a consequence of Medtronic's promotion of a
bone graft device for "off-label" uses, a California trial court has ruled in
denying summary judgment.

A surgeon used an INFUSE bone graft manufactured by Medtronic to fuse bone in
the plaintiff's back. Instead of experiencing relief from her back pain, the
plaintiff alleged that her condition worsened and that she required additional
surgery.

The plaintiff filed a product liability claim, alleging that her surgeon used
the INFUSE device in a manner that had not been approved by the Food and Drug
Administration. According to the plaintiff, Medtronic was liable because it had
illegally promoted its bone graft device for such "off-label" uses.

Medtronic argued that the plaintiff's claims were expressly preempted by federal
law under Riegel v. Medtronic, Inc. (552 U.S. 312). (See "State law claims over
medical devices are preempted," Lawyers USA, March 10, 2008.)

The court disagreed, explaining the plaintiff's claim "is not based on
allegations that Medtronic's device violated state tort law notwithstanding
compliance with the relevant federal requirements. In contrast, the plaintiff
here is alleging that Medtronic promoted the use of its device in violation of
federal requirements. Accordingly, Riegel is not authority that plaintiff's
claims against Medtronic are preempted here. "

In addition, the court rejected Medtronic's contention that the plaintiffs'
lawsuit was impliedly preempted under Buckman Co. v. Plaintiffs' Legal Comm.
(531 U.S. 341). (See "Medical device maker can't be sued in tort for 'fraud on
the FDA,'" Lawyers USA, March 5, 2001.)

Idaho:Gardener's Twofer: First Ketchup 'N' Fries Plant Hits U.S. Market

LENGTH: 883  words

DATELINE: Boise


American Falls District Library of Idaho has issued the followinga news release:

Love growing potatoes and tomatoes? This spring, gardeners in the U.S. (and
Europe) will be able to get both tuber and fruit from a single plant.

It even has a catchy name: Ketchup 'n' Fries.

"It's like a science project," says Alice Doyle of SuperNaturals Grafted
Vegetables, the company that's licensing the variety for U.S. markets from the
U.K. company that developed it. "It's something that is really bizarre, but it's
going to be fun [for gardeners] to measure and see how it grows."

This isn't a genetically modified organism but a plant of two different
nightshades: the top of a cherry tomato grafted on to a white potato.

"Tomatoes and potatoes are in the same family and that makes it feasible," says
John Bagnasco, also of SuperNaturals.

Grafting, the technique of taking two different plants in the same family and
fusing them together, has been around since ancient times. Today, fruit trees,
grape vines and roses are still grafted onto well-established rootstocks. (A New
York artist is even attempting to graft branches from 40 different kinds of
stone fruit onto a single tree, as The Salt reported in August.)

Grafting is advantageous for higher yields and disease resistance. For example,
a tree that is genetically resistant to soil diseases might not produce a juicy
peach or a perfectly tart apple. So plant breeders can take branches from trees
with tastier fruit and graft them onto the hardy rootstocks.
Sam Van Aken's grafted fruit trees are still quite young, but this artist
rendering shows what he expects the "Tree of 40 Fruit" to look like in
springtime in a few years.

Guerrilla Grafters Bring Forbidden Fruit Back To City Trees

Over the last century, botanists have discovered vegetable or soft-tissue
grafting. Grafters will take two separate seedlings -- with stems of the same
size and shape -- and cut them in half. The top of one is then matched with the
wound of the bottom. They are fused with a tiny plastic clip and taken into a
special greenhouse while they grow into one plant. If the combination is
correct, the whole organism should be stronger.

This idea of the tomato-potato twofer isn't actually new either. In the early
1900s, botanist Luther Burbank successfully grafted a potato top onto a tomato
root, creating a viable plant -- except that it was, shall we say, fruitless. He
even experimented with a tomato-potato hybrid, affectionately named a "pomato."
Since then, home gardeners have experimented with these Chimera-esque grafted
plants to varying success.

Finding the right partners is tricky at best. You have to find two plants that
work well together to produce a balanced harvest of fruit and tubers.

"If you're growing a potato from a seed, as the potato germinates, the stem is
much thinner than a tomato when it germinates," says Bagnasco. "You have to
start the seeds at separate times and try to get the potatoes' stem up to size."

The plant is an early tomato grafted to a late-producing potato. The two can be
harvested throughout the season. i

SuperNaturals

After five years of experimenting, SuperNaturals decided to license an already
successful variety developed for Thomas & Morgan, a U.K.-based plant company.
About 40,000 TomTatoes were sold last year in the U.K., says Michael Perry, a
product development manager for Thomas & Morgan who worked on TomTato. He says
the goal was to make a combination that was more than a novelty plant.

"It's not just any old tomato or any old potato. It's actually a really good,
all-around potato at the base," Perry says. "Then on the top you've got the
potential to have up to 500 super-sweet fruit."

vegetable.

They also had to find an early tomato and late-producing potato, so the two
could be harvested throughout the season. It took 15 years to develop the
winning combination.

The TomTato is being released as Ketchup 'N' Fries in the U.S. this spring, and
the producers say the plant is sparking new interest in gardening. Perry says it
wasn't just his usual customers who were interested in this last year in the
U.K.

"It was also teenagers and kids -- people who wouldn't have been interested
before, so it kind of opened it to a wider audience," he says.

SuperNaturals says garden centers across the country will be stocking Ketchup
'N' Fries in the spring. It's also available online at Garden America and at the
Territorial Seed Co.

manufacturing facility, consolidating the production to the company's Burlington
headquarters, and ending production and sales of its TAArget/UniFit aortic stent
grafts.

LeMaitre, which makes disposable and implantable vascular devices, said in a
news release that the closure of its Laguna Hills, California, site, which it
acquired through its November 2010 buyout of LifeSpan Vascular Graft, is the
company's seventh such consolidation since 2002. The closure should save
LeMaitre $400,000 per year and bring all of its manufacturing to the Burlington
location, according to a statement by company chairman/CEO George W. LeMaitre.

LeMaitre Vascular said it will stop making its TAArget/UniFit aortic stent
grafts as of June 30, though it plans to continue selling to the European market
its Endologix stent graft.

"The TAArget/UniFit exit removes a declining product from our sales bag to allow
greater focus on our faster-growing vascular products," LeMaitre said.

Cotabato official's suspension sought

BYLINE: REINA TOLENTINO

LENGTH: 288 words


SOURCED FROM CURRENT GLOBAL NEWSPAPERS AND JOURNALS

The prosecution is asking the Sandiganbayan's Second Division to suspend Rep.
Pedro Acharon Jr. of South Cotabato's first district pending litigation of the
graft charge filed against him in connection with cash advances worth about P2.5
million.

The transaction was made in 2006 when he was mayor of General Santos City.

In its motion, the prosecution cited Section 13 of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt
Practices Act, which mandates preventive suspension on any incumbent public
officer facing a valid graft charge.

"Considering that the validity of the information in the instant case had
already been established, and invoking the mandate of the law and jurisprudence,
suspension of all the accused pending litigation is now mandatory," the
prosecution said.

It then asked the court to issue an order suspending Acharon Jr. "from his
office and any other public office which he may occupy pending trial."

The Office of the Ombudsman charged Acharon Jr. of graft in 2012, along with
former General Santos City Finance Administrator Marcelino Dospueblos and
private individual Chriselda Macion, for causing two cash advances totaling P2.5
million for the "Pagana Dinner Show and Tambayayong Festival" in Los Angeles,
California.

Macion was the president and representative of General Santos City Tourism
Association Inc., a non-government organization.

The respondents knew "fully well" that the sum was intended for 37 participants
when only 17 were able to participate in the said festival, according to the
charge sheet, "and, thereafter, the said accused failed to liquidate the amount
of P2,500,000.00 thereby causing undue injury to the Government in the aforesaid
amount."

mutation analysis from FFPE and FNA tumor samples to identify both known and de
novo mutations. The Service features the SuraSeq 200 and the SuraSeq 500 cancer
panels which target clinically relevant cancer-related molecular pathways, such
as the MEK/MAP kinase and PIK3/AKT pathways. In addition, Asuragen scientists
have amassed quantitative and predictive QC data from more than 700 real-world
FFPE and FNA tumor samples, and this information has been integrated into the
sequencing approach to best guide clients in their experimental decision-making.
A recent publication in the Journal of Molecular Diagnostics describes the
validation of the two-step PCR enrichment work[#xfb02]ow used with the SuraSeq
500 panel.

o CryoLife (Atlanta) has received FDA clearance for a next-generation HeRO
(Hemodialysis Reliable Outflow) device. The HeRO device is the only subcutaneous
AV access solution clinically proven to maintain long-term access for end-stage
renal disease (ERSD) hemodialysis patients with central venous stenosis, the
company said. CryoLife anticipates launching the next generation HeRO device
during 4Q13 following scale up and validation of the manufacturing process. The
newly cleared version features an adaptor that provides the option to pair the
HeRO device's proprietary venous outflow component with certain other available
dialysis access grafts, including early access arterial grafts. The current
generation includes a standard ePTFE graft, which requires the placement of a
temporary dialysis catheter for approximately 2-3 weeks until the graft
incorporates into the surrounding tissue and can be used for hemodialysis
access.

o Illumina (San Diego) has introduced the next product in its TruSight line of
content sets, TruSight Tumor, for NGS-based somatic variant detection in solid
tumors. TruSight Tumor provides optimized amplicon-based library preparation of

Product Briefs   o AMI Semiconductor (Pocatello, Idaho) reported that Dynamic
Hearing (Richmond, Australia), a technology company making solutions for hearing
aids, has selected the Ezairo 5900 series of integrated circuits and packaged
hybrids for its latest suite of high-end sound processing algorithms. The Ezairo
5900 series features a 24-bit precision open programmable DSP core combined with
a highly reconfigurable HEAR accelerator engine. This dual-core architecture
allows Dynamic Hearing algorithms to run with an optimal balance between
performance and power consumption. Ezairo 5900 includes all necessary on-chip
peripheral blocks to directly interface with transducers, battery and controls.
The hearing aid designer, running on Ezairo 5900, combines extremely high
performance and functionality while using battery power sparingly, thus enabling
manufacturers to produce discrete, attractive and comfortable hearing aids for
use in every listening situation. Dynamic Hearing makes mixed-signal and
structured digital products for the automotive, medical and industrial sectors.

o Endologix (Irvine, California) reported receipt of FDA approval to manufacture
the ePTFE graft material used in the Powerlink system for the minimally invasive
treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). More specifically, ePTFE is the
graft material that covers the Powerlink system's self-expanding cobalt chromium
alloy stent cage. The company's self-manufactured ePTFE graft material meets the
same product specifications as that currently in use in Powerlink System
production. Endologix makes minimally invasive treatments for vascular diseases.

o E-Z-EM (Lake Success, New York) reported that it has received 510(k) clearance
for its EmpowerMR injector system, the company's first product for the MRI
market. EmpowerMR uses features designed to cope with the problem of electrical
interference in the magnetic field of the MR scanner. MRI systems operate by
detecting minute variances in the alignment of molecules within certain tissues
of the human body. To detect these variances, MR systems create powerful
magnetic fields, and require the use of non-magnetic materials and components in
the immediate surroundings of the scanner. Electromechanical devices like
injector systems can create both electric and magnetic fields that cause
electrical interference with the scanner during the imaging process, leading to
image distortion or artifacts. To minimize this problem, EmpowerMR uses a
hydraulic control system instead of the shielded electrical control components
used by most other MR injectors systems.EmpowerMR provides for utilization in MR
field strengths up to 7 Tesla. E-Z-EM makes contrast agents for gastrointestinal
radiology.

o HydroCision (Billerica, Massachusetts) launched a new product, MicroResector
MD, at the 2007 annual meeting of the American Association of Neurological
Surgeons (AANS; Rolling Meadows, Illinois), this week in Washington. The
MicroResector MD is based on HydroCision's HydroDiscectomy platform, designed to
use a high-velocity waterjet to quickly decompress herniated discs, providing
relief to patients suffering from chronic back and/or leg pain. The
HydroDiscectomy procedure bridges the gap between conservative therapy and
conventional open surgery, according to the company. HydroDiscectomy is intended
to offer an option to patients who have failed conservative treatments. In a
recent retrospective study of the outcomes of 27 patients who underwent a
HydroDiscectomy procedure to treat their lumbar herniated disc, these patients
required zero revision procedures within the first year after surgery, compared
to 34 patients who underwent a microdiscectomy spine surgery using conventional
techniques to treat a lumbar herniation, 17.6% of whom required a revision
microdiscectomy within a year after surgery. HydroCision is a developer and
distributor of fluidjet-based surgical tools.

Deals roundup: CryoLife completes Hemosphere acquisition for more than $17M

LENGTH: 320 words

A Medical Device Daily Staff Report

CryoLife (Kennesaw, Georgia) said it has completed its acquisition of Hemosphere
(Eden Prairie, Minnesota). The company reported its intent to acquire Hemosphere
earlier this week for $17 million in cash, plus potential revenue
milestone-based payments of up to $4.5 million (Medical Device Daily, May 16,
2012).

Hemosphere makes the HeRO (Hemodialysis Reliable Outflow) graft for end-stage
renal disease hemodialysis patients with limited access options and central
venous obstruction.

CryoLife will begin the integration of the Hemosphere business immediately and
expects to begin training its sales force on the HeRO graft in the second
quarter 2012, followed by a launch of the HeRO graft in the U.S. through its
28-person cardiovascular sales team late in the third quarter 2012.

"The talented team at Hemosphere has developed a unique technology for end-stage
renal disease hemodialysis patients that are otherwise faced with sub-optimal
treatment alternatives," said Steven Anderson, president/CEO of CryoLife. "We
believe that this acquisition is well in-line with our cardiovascular focus and
look forward to integrating the business and collaborating with the Hemosphere
team to train our sales reps on the HeRO graft."

In other dealmaking activity, SurgLine International (West Palm Beach, Florida)
said it has acquired Eden Surgical Technologies (Southlake, Texas), a
distributor of trauma products, in a share exchange agreement. SurgLine said it
exchanged 50 million shares of its restricted common stock.

"The acquisition of Eden will substantially expand our line of trauma products
while providing the company with pricing which we believe will give us a
competitive advantage in the marketplace. We will have immediate access to
products that are crucial to our acute care hospital clients in particular.
These products include both stainless steel and titanium offerings."

AIDS cases linked to organ donor; Officials: Only 8 of 59 grafts are believed to
be infectious

BYLINE: By Steve Sternberg Staff writerCopyright 1991, The Atlanta Journal and
The Atlanta Constitutiondisease; human; materials; safety; health; public;

The Centers for Disease Control and the Food and Drug Administration are
tracking the donated organs and tissues of a man infected with the AIDS virus
who was killed in 1985 and who may have infected up to 59 people in 16 states.

So far, the three recipients of the man's kidneys and heart have died of AIDS,
and another person - who received a bone graft - has tested positive for the
deadly virus, according to a memo obtained by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

Most of the remaining grafts were treated with either alcohol or radiation and
are not believed to be infectious, officials said. But eight grafts - of bone,
soft tissues and a pancreas - were not processed in ways likely to kill the
virus, and may be infectious.

One recipient, who has not been identified or located, got a tissue graft at the
Medical College of Georgia, officials said.

Dr. Scott Holmberg, a CDC epidemiologist who heads the AIDS program's special
studies section, said Thursday that the two federal agencies are working with
LifeNet Transplantation Services, the network that supplied the tissues, "to
determine whether any other individuals may have been infected."

The case is the first in which so many tissue recipients have been placed at
potential risk by a single donor.

"There have been several million tissue grafts, but this is the first such
incident," said Tim Hubbard, president of Chathamborough Research Group, which
is representing LifeNet of Virginia Beach, Va.

It is the third incident in the United States in which recipients of
transplanted organs are known to have become infected with the AIDS virus,
officials said. A 1986 case involved a kidney recipient at the Medical College
of Georgia. The recipient has never developed any symptoms of AIDS, a
spokeswoman said.

The Virginia donor died at the age of 22 from a gunshot wound to the head during
a robbery in October 1985. He had tested negative for the Human Immunodeficiency
Virus (HIV) twice before his organs were removed - but officials believe he may
have been so recently infected that his body did not register any signs of the
virus.

Dr. Holmberg said doctors long have recognized the potential for HIV
transmission through organ transplantation, and the risk may never entirely be
eliminated because organs would suffer from any attempt to kill the AIDS virus.
Tissues and organs, like blood, are tested before transplantation.

But tests will detect exposure only after the immune system has time to produce
antibodies to fight the virus.

"One of every 50,000 units of blood may transmit the virus," Dr. Holmberg said.
"Those cases are constantly being investigated. What's different here is that
you have more tissues and organs than you would get from blood donors. However,
the vast majority of the tissues in this case were processed in a way that
should eliminate the virus."

Doctors annually transplant 1,500 hearts, 9,000 kidneys, 1,200 livers, 125
pancreases and from 30 to 50 hearts joined with lungs. Patients also receive as
many as 300,000 tissue grafts each year.

The gunshot victim's organs and tissues were distributed to 30 hospitals across
the United States for transplantation. Officials would not identify the
hospitals or the states in which the transplants took place. The names of donors
and patients are routinely kept confidential to protect their privacy.

A memorandum from FDA Deputy Commissioner James Benson to Assistant Secretary of
Health James Mason says surgeons removed the man's heart, kidneys, liver and
pancreas at the Medical College of Virginia in Richmond. They were immediately
transplanted into five recipients. The recipients of the heart and kidneys
"developed HIV infection and eventually died," Dr. Benson wrote.

The recipient of the transplanted liver died - of complications, not AIDS -
shortly after surgery. The recipient of the pancreas still has not been located.
A fourth recipient, an elderly woman from Colorado who received a transplanted
hip, has tested positive for the virus.

In addition to the organs, doctors removed bone and tendon, two corneas and bone
marrow for transplantation. The corneas are not believed to be infectious
because they do not contain blood vessels; the marrow was donated to the U.S.
Navy, where its only use was for research.

Mr. Hubbard said the network has begun contacting 30 hospitals nationwide to
track 53 other recipients of bone and tissue who may also be carrying the virus.
The fate of the Medical College of Georgia recipient is unknown - the college
was not informed of the case until late Thursday.

The case of the Colorado woman was the first to surface. Officials at the
Colorado Department of Health notified LifeNet of the case and warned that
others might have become infected as well. Mr. Hubbard notified the FDA on May
8, according to the Benson memo.

Two days ago, new AIDS virus tests of "archived" samples of the donor's blood
proved to be positive for exposure to the virus.

Although CDC epidemiologists said they heard rumors of the case two weeks ago,
they were not officially notified until late last week, and met Tuesday with
representatives of LifeNet and the FDA.

Dr. Benson's memorandum to Dr. Mason said the FDA plays no role in regulating
organ donation. He warned Dr. Mason that publicity over the issue "may generate
public concern that FDA should play a more active role in the regulation of
tissue/organ donations."

The statement may reflect recent criticism by an FDA advisory panel that the
agency does not have the manpower or funding to safeguard the nation's food and
drugs, much less take on a broader role in regulating organ transplants.

Stitching together a lifesaver for humanity

SECTION: HEALTH; Your Health; Pg. 6

MEDICAL MATTERS:A look at the life of Michael DeBakey, the unasssuming inventor
of the artificial heart graft, who died last month,  Dr Muiris Houston

THE ATMOSPHERE in the operating theatre was tense. There was blood everywhere.
All of us present, from the lowly intern (me), to the experienced theatre sister
and the professor of surgery, held our collective breaths.

We stared into the abdomen of the 68-year-old man who hours earlier had come to
the hospital with the first signs and symptoms of a leaking aortic aneurysm. The
aorta is the large vessel that carries blood from the heart to the abdomen and
the legs; it can sometimes balloon outwards at a certain point to create what is
called an aneurysm.

Above a certain size, aneurysms become troublesome: if the victim is lucky, they
go off slowly in the form of a leak; but aneurysms may also rupture and bleed
suddenly, causing the person to die.

Our patient was lucky: after hours of painstaking surgery we had got him to the
point where a patch had been applied to the damaged part of the blood vessel. We
were now looking intently to see if the patch would hold, or whether blood would
leak slowly from its stitched edge.

The patch in question was a Dacron artificial graft, which has transformed the
practice of vascular surgery. It meant that previously inoperable aneurysms of
the aorta could now be surgically repaired.

The inventor of the Dacron patch died last month. Michael Ellis DeBakey was a
true pioneer of cardiovascular surgery. In 1952, he successfully repaired an
aortic aneurysm by replacing the damaged segment with a graft from a cadaver.

But DeBakey was concerned that natural grafts would themselves contain
atherosclerosis and could lead to further problems for the patient. He reputedly
worked at home with his wife's sewing machine developing the artificial graft. A
year later, in 1953, he performed the first successful aneurysm repair using
Dacron.

The professor I worked with as a surgical intern had trained with DeBakey, and
spoke regularly of the man's brilliance. But it wasn't until I read his obituary
in a number of medical journals that I realised just how influential he had
been.

Born in Louisiana in 1908, DeBakey was the oldest child of Lebanese Christian
parents (Da Baghi) who left the Middle East because of religious intolerance. A
medical graduate of Tulane University in New Orleans, he completed his studies
at the University of Strasbourg, France and Heidelberg University in Germany. He
spent the rest of his career at Baylor College of Medicine and Methodist
Hospital, Houston, Texas.

Fans of the long-running TV series MASH can thank DeBakey: during the second
World War he developed the Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (MASH) concept. It was
an inspired move that brought battlefield surgery close to the front line. And,
of course, Hollywood illustrated its further development in the Korean and
Vietnam wars to great effect.

DeBakey pioneered coronary artery bypass surgery. In a 2005 lecture to the New
York Academy of Medicine, he recalled that his team at Houston had performed the
first successful coronary bypass operation in 1964, but did not announce the
breakthrough for 10 years.

He was also the first surgeon to carry out a carotid endarterectomy, in which
blockages in the neck vessels that supply the brain are removed. This operation
went on to become the standard surgical procedure for people considered to be at
high risk of stroke.

DeBakey also showed his talents as an inventor when he develped a ventricular
assist device (VAD). Anticipating a shortage of hearts for transplantation, the
device helped keep people alive until a suitable organ became available. Modern
versions are now used to treat patients with severe heart failure.

Having carried out more than 60,000 cardiovascular procedures, it is not
suprising to learn that DeBakey continued to operate into his 90s. And, in an
interesting twist, at the age of 97 he himself underwent an operation where his
colleagues replaced part of his aorta with an artificial graft.

DeBakey attributed his longevity to never having smoked and to good genes that
enabled other members of his family also to live into their 90s.

For those less fortunate than he was, this remarkable medic has directly and
indirectly helped save thousands of lives. Among the many whom DeBakey has
helped was our patient who went home, fit and well, to his wife and family some
two weeks after coming off the operating table.

Court report: Medtronic prevails in patent suit by Gore

LENGTH: 391 words

A Medical Device Daily Staff Report

Medtronic (Minneapolis) reported that a judge in the Eastern District Court of
Virginia has ruled in the company's favor in a patent case brought by W.L. Gore
& Associates (Flagstaff, Arizona). The patent in question involved a method of
making stent grafts, which are implantable devices used to treat aortic
aneurysms. The judge determined that Medtronic's stent grafts did not infringe
Gore's U.S. Patent No. 5,810,870, Medtronic said.

Tony Semedo, VP/GM for Endovascular Therapies at Medtronic, said the court's
decision enables Medtronic to continue its focus on advancing the standard of
care for the endovascular repair of aortic aneurysms. "In that context, respect
for intellectual property remains a core principle that we continuously and
vigorously defend," Semedo said.

New York's legal corruption problem

BYLINE: ADAM BRODSKY

SECTION: All Editions; Pg. 33

LENGTH: 689 words


Shelly Silver and Dean Skelos broke the law, but when it comes to politicians,
New York's got a far bigger problem: corruption that's perfectly legal.

"I seen my opportunities, and I took 'em." Tammany boss George Washington
Plunkitt used that famous, comically frank excuse to explain the "honest graft"
that made him rich. Indeed, he took pride in his corruption, because he
distinguished it from "dishonest graft."

In 1870, Plunkitt held four offices - assemblyman, alderman, police magistrate
and county supervisor - and pulled down three salaries. His "honest graft," was
based on his ability to "see an opportunity" - say, buying up land where,
unknown to the public, a park would later be built, then selling it at a
handsome profit.

Or handing out pay raises and perks for public workers: "Don't you know that
Tammany gains 10 votes for every one it lost by salary raisin'?" he asked.

Silver and Skelos committed flat-out crimes. But what about the "honest graft,"
the kind of corruption that takes a toll on millions who don't even realize it -
all while breaking no laws? It's as fetid as the "dishonest" kind. New York's
pols trade legislative favors, steer contracts, set wages and grant tax breaks.

But democracy itself encourages quid pro quo deals - many that are perfectly
legal, and others that may not be, but that are hard to prove otherwise.
Prosecutors are lucky indeed to find evidence as clear-cut as in the Skelos and
Silver cases.

A candidate, for instance, might promise pay hikes for public workers or tax
breaks for select groups, knowing he'll get their political support. That's
totally legal. A businessman might buy ads hawking a candidate who vows to build
roads. That's OK, too, even if the roads provide a particular benefit to the
man's trucking business.

But special interests can undermine the process. Consider how the teachers
unions in New York have used their vast resources to back pols who, once in
office, turn around and reward them - notably, by making it impossible to fire
incompetent teachers.

Or, in the city, how the taxi cartel has showered a fortune on City Hall. In
return, the pols protect the medallion owners' monopoly on street hails and hold
down the supply of cabs, even if it means stranding riders in rainstorms. Uber
and Lyft recently managed to get around the monopoly by letting riders hail cars
via smartphone apps, but Mayor de Blasio has even tried to thwart that.

Legal corruption in New York is endless: Trial lawyers get Albany to pass laws
that encourage lawsuits - and help their practices. Tax abatements go to
businessmen who back the pols who grant them.

How about this one? The City Council recently passed a law to require
non-unionized car washes, but not unionized ones, to post prohibitively
expensive surety bonds.

Reformers think curbing campaign donations will fix the problem. Wrong: Bribers
will always find a way to bribe; it's the regular citizens who'll face limits on
supporting the candidates of their choice.

What can help? Limiting the favors pols can do for friends in the first place.
The fewer and simpler the zoning laws, the fewer the variances to be "sold" to
well-connected pleaders. The lower the taxes, the less money to steer.

Let's keep pols out of the marketplace, too - so they can't pick favorite
industries to help, dictate wages, set up contracts for big backers or hand out
subsidies to friends. (On this, Skelos and Silver have nothing on Gov. Cuomo,
who gives away billions each year in state tax breaks and credits.)

It boils down to this: Power corrupts, as the saying goes. So limit an
official's power, and you can probably limit a good deal of corruption.

There's more: Steps to end the lifetime tenures of incumbents would help. And,
of course, an engaged electorate is crucial.

Nothing can completely purge any political system of all sleaze, legal or
otherwise. But, as US Attorney Preet Bharara says, "The public corruption crisis
in New York is more than a prosecutor's problem."

At some point, New Yorkers have to stand up for themselves.

Titan Spine Receives FDA Clearance to Launch Endoskeleton® TL Device for Lateral
Spinal Fusion

LENGTH: 588  words


Washington, D.C.: Biotechnology Industry Organization has issued the following
news release:

First Surgeries Conducted by Kade Huntsman, M.D.

Titan Spine, a medical device surface technology company focused on developing
innovative spinal interbody fusion implants, today announced that it has
received clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to
commercially release its Endoskeleton® TL system, a spinal fusion system
utilizing a lateral approach. The Endoskeleton® TL represents the first lateral
fusion device to feature surface technology that is designed to participate in
the fusion process by creating an osteogenic response to the implant's
topography.

The Endoskeleton® TL device utilizes Titan's proprietary roughened titanium
surface technology which has been shown to upregulate the production of
osteogenic and angiogenic factors that are critical for bone growth and fusion.
In addition, the design of the TL device incorporates large windows and large
internal volumes to allow for significant bone graft packing, clear CT and MRI
imaging, desired bone graft loading, and the ability to pack additional bone
graft material within the device following implantation. Members of the TL
design team include Kade Huntsman, M.D., Orthopedic Spine Surgeon with the Salt
Lake Orthopaedic Clinic in Salt Lake City, Utah; Andy Kranenburg, M.D.,
Co-Medical Director of the Providence Medford Medical Center Spine Institute in
Medford, OR; Axel Reinhardt, M.D., Head of the Department of Spinal Surgery at
the Specialized Orthopaedic Hospital in Potsdam, Germany; and Paul Slosar, M.D.,
Chief Medical Officer for Titan Spine.

Dr. Huntsman performed the first surgeries utilizing the Endoskeleton® TL on
July 9th, 2014 at St. Mark's Hospital in Salt Lake City, Utah. He said, "I was
extremely pleased with the performance of the system. For the first time, I was
able to insert additional bone graft material in to a lateral device
post-implantation, and the radiopaque nature of the TL made it extremely easy to
place the device in the desired location. I am excited to offer the TL, and the
benefits of its surface technology and design features, to my patients requiring
lateral interbody fusion."

"The Endoskeleton® TL device is the first application of surface technology to
the lateral approach," commented Dr. Slosar. "The ability to orchestrate
cellular behavior and promote bone growth in response to an interbody device has
not been in the lateral surgeon's armamentarium until now. The TL is the
byproduct of a unique collaboration between academic biomaterial scientists,
spine surgeons, and industry experts to create a truly differentiated lateral
interbody device that is designed to benefit both patients and surgeons. With
the addition of the TL device, Titan Spine now offers its surface technology and
complete line of titanium devices for virtually all interbody fusion spine
surgery procedures in the cervical and lumbar spine."

The full line of Endoskeleton® devices features Titan Spine's proprietary
implant surface technology, consisting of a unique combination of roughened
topographies at the macro, micro, and cellular levels. This combination of
surface topographies is designed to create an optimal host-bone response and
actively participate in the fusion process by promoting new bone growth,
encouraging natural production of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP's) and
creating the potential for a faster and more robust fusion.

Dayton blood center let everybody compete

SECTION: OPINIONS; Pg. A10

LENGTH: 663 words


When the blood center decided to move its most sophisticated work involving
tissue donations and grafts to Kettering, some worried that the City of Dayton
had let another big one get away.

That's not true, says the top official at the Community Blood Center /Community
Tissue Services. Dr. David Smith said he simply wanted space that downtown
doesn't have.

That's a loss for Dayton, because the blood center and its tissue operation have
been growing during the last decade.

But keeping the entire organization in the region - not all operations will move
to Research Park in Kettering - is still a big win for the community.

The Community Blood Center/ Community Tissue Services is a nonprofit group
located on South Main Street in downtown, where the blood center will remain.
That part of the organization provides blood and blood components to 26
hospitals in 15 Ohio and Indiana counties.

The other part of the business - the tissue operation- is national, composed of
branches in Fort Worth, Fresno, Portland, Boise, Indianapolis, Toledo,
Philadelphia and Memphis, with the headquarters here.

Though precise comparisons are hard to make, the tissue operation believes it's
the largest nonprofit provider of skin grafts for severe burn patients in the
United States, and that it's among the five-largest tissue banks in the country.
All told, it says it distributed 110,000 tissue grafts in 2008.

Indeed, a tour of the downtown facility reveals an organization doing the kind
of cutting-edge work that the region wants to be involved in.

The tissue center recovers tissue from deceased individuals who have agreed to
be donors. Tendons, ligaments, skin, bones and cartilage all can be stored and
used later to repair, say, Cincinnati quarterback Carson Palmer's injured knee.

The tissue center has outgrown its space downtown and has been looking to
expand. It wrote letters to multiple local governments, explaining its needs for
what amounts to a hightech medical manufacturing operation. Bones, for example,
are actually machined to a specification using equipment that is remarkably
similar to that used in making automobile parts.

Specifically, it wanted a large, onefloor facility for its high-tech "clean
rooms."

Dayton tried to compete with aggressive financial incentives, and it also
offered space at Tech Town, the campus-like setting to the east of Fifth Third
Field. And it proposed building a facility on Dave Hall Plaza near the
Convention Center.

In the end, Research Park was the choice.

There are some take-aways for companies and local governments from the
experience:

* The community has remarkable economic success stories that aren't always
widely known or even appreciated. Staying in touch with those businesses,
knowing what their growth plans are, is important work. Nobody likes to be taken
for granted or, even worse, to be ignored.

* The blood center took the right approach by being public and direct about what
it wanted, giving communities the opportunity to compete. Communication is a
two-way street, and especially in this day and age when governments are short on
people, they can't know what businesses' needs are unless those businesses are
honestly speaking up.

* It's a crying shame that the area around the Montgomery County Fairgrounds
isn't in play for development. It could have been a great location for this sort
of operation, what with Miami Valley Hospital across the street.

* Finally, for some sorts of operations, downtown is at a distinct disadvantage.
It doesn't have a lot of campus-like space (yet another reason that letting the
expansive Fairgrounds property stay fallow is such a waste). That puts the city
in the position of having to identify other selling points, which may not be
what companies want most. That doesn't mean downtown is a bad place to do
business or that it's the city's fault if it gets rejected.

The blood and tissue centers are plum operations to have. The important thing is
that they're both still in the region.

Federal funding cut means fewer local Head Start slots, jobs

BYLINE: Amanda Seitz, Hamilton JournalNews, Ohio

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 424 words


Aug. 15--HAMILTON -- Fewer Butler County children will be able to participate in
a federal program that provides preschool for low-income families this year.

Dozens of parents, teachers and Democratic leaders gathered outside the Butler
County Government Services building Wednesday to protest the automatic spending
cuts, which went into affect earlier this year and slashed the budgets of
federally-funded Head Start programs across the country.

Butler County's Head Start program had to trim its own $4.5 million budget by
$230,000 -- resulting in the closure of two classrooms along with the layoffs of
two teachers, two teacher assistants, a principal, a family service worker and
an assistant manager.

The cuts mean only 720 students, ages three to five, will be accepted into the
Head Start program this year -- 64 students less than last year, said Jon Graft,
the Superintendent of Butler County Education Services, which runs the local
Head Start program. Graft said the cuts mean less impoverished children in
Butler County will be prepared for kindergarten.

"The impact of early childhood programming, the school readiness when they're
entering kindergarten, is very effective," Graft said.

Donald Feerer, of New Miami, attended Wednesday's rally and said he himself is a
product of Head Start and now relies on it for his children.

"I'm not going to be able to afford their college," the father of four said.
"So, I'm trying to instill upon them the thirst of knowledge."

State Representative Denise Driehaus, D-Clifton, who also spoke about the Head
Start program during the rally, said she's heard from parents like Feerer who
want to see the program restored.

"We're trying to promote this idea that we need to invest in kids," Driehaus
said. "We're hearing all over the state, and in Cincinnati, Dayton, Middletown
and Hamilton, (Head Start) really impacts lives."

Graft said hundreds of families living in poverty across Butler County typically
apply to be in the Head Start program and are often wait-listed throughout the
year. The program accepts families who are living 100 percent or below the
poverty line. A family of four, for example, living off a $23,550 income is
considered to live on the poverty line.

"We take the neediest of needy," Graft said.

Dave Kern, the executive committee chairman of the Butler County Republican
Party, could not be reached for comment.

Valuable human skin stolen: police

BYLINE: Patricia Madej, Philadelphia Daily News

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. B6

LENGTH: 294 words

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA


It's the kind of tale that would make anyone's skin crawl.

Gary Dudek, 54, of Wallingford, Pennsylvania, allegedly stole about $357,000 US
worth of human skin from Mercy Philadelphia Hospital from November 2011 to July
of last year.

Hospital employees were conducting record checks in the bioscience department in
January when they saw Dudek take skin grafts to his car, according to court
records.

And although the employees weren't sure how long this allegedly had been going
on, they found past surveillance footage of two similar instances.

Dudek was arrested Monday and charged with theft, receiving stolen property and
tampering with records.

From September 2006 to September 2013, Dudek worked as a "tissue-regeneration
specialist" - a sales representative - for Organogenesis, a Massachusetts firm
that specializes in regenerative medicine, a company spokeswoman said.

But in that capacity, Dudek would have had no use for human skin, said the
spokeswoman, Angelyn Lowe, director of corporate communications at
Organogenesis. "We're known as the most ethical company in the business," she
said.

Lowe said the firm does not buy or sell skin grafts, patches of skin used mostly
as replacements for large infections, burns or wounds. Instead, she said,
Organogenesis developed a product called Apligraf, made of collagen and skin
cells designed to mimic human skin.

Dudek's job title allowed him to order grafts whenever he needed, according to
court records. The hospital only needed three in stock at a time, but Dudek
ordered an unauthorized 219 - valued at $1,700 each - which the hospital never
saw, the records say.

Philadelphia police said they were unaware of a motive or of what happened to
the grafts allegedly ordered by Dudek, who is to appear in court June 10.

BRIEF: FDA approves new TriVascular device developed in Santa Rosa

BYLINE: Robert Digitale, The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa, Calif.

SECTION: BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS

LENGTH: 196 words


Jan. 21--Santa Rosa med-tech developer TriVascular Inc. announced Monday it has
won federal approval to sell an updated version of its stent graft system for
repairing weakened aortas.

The Ovation Prime system is a newer version of the stent graft system approved
by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration last fall. That was the company's first
product to win U.S. approval, though TriVascular won permission in 2010 to sell
the device in Europe.

The stent graft system repairs abdominal aortic aneurysms, bulges in the aorta
that can rupture, causing internal bleeding and death.

Ovation Prime has more flexibility to make its way through the femoral artery at
the top of the leg, said TriVascular spokeswoman Meredith Huetter. The new
device also has more "markers" that show up in X-ray-like imaging in order to
better position the stent graft in the body.

TriVascular has more than 200 employees in Santa Rosa. Last June, the company
announced it had raised $60 million to help launch its devices in the U.S.
market.

Product updates

·ArthroCare (Sunnyvale, California) recently introduced four new disposable
devices for spinal surgery. According to the company, the expanded product line
which now comprises six devices, improves the ease of use and functionality of
ArthroCare's coblation-based spinal surgery system. All four of the new
disposable devices are designed to remove soft tissue - including disc and scar
tissue - more aggressively than the initial disposable devices ArthroCare
fielded for spinal surgery. In addition, all four of the new devices incorporate
the company's proprietary suction functionality, which the company says enhances
a surgeon's visibility and control during surgical procedures. The new SpineVac
and DisCoblator XL are designed for arthroscopic thoracic spinal indications
while the Aggressor is a larger device designed for lumbar procedures. The
VersaTor is a tissue-cutting tool with a longer shaft for improved access to the
surgical site. ArthroCare's spinal surgery system is currently being used in
open surgical procedures in the spine.

·Biomax Technologies (Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada) has received an
Office Action from the U.S. Patent Office indicating that at least 13 claims in
its primary U.S. patent application related to the company's Optical Catheter
technology will be allowable pending minor formal amendments. In addition, the
company has completed its final large animal study using the Optical Catheter.
The company says it has obtained sufficient animal data to seek an
Investigational Device Exemption from the FDA, enabling the company to begin a
clinical trial using the Optical Catheter, before the end of 2000. Biomax is a
medical device company that makes optically based technologies for the treatment
and diagnosis of disease states including cancer and organ rejection.

·Biopure (Cambridge, Massachusetts) reported enrollling more than the 640
patients in a pivotal Phase III clinical trial of its investigational drug,
Hemopure, and is continuing to enroll additional patients. This single-blind
trial is evaluating the company's sterile oxygen therapeutic solution as a room
temperature stable, universally compatible alternative to red blood cell
transfusion in orthopedic surgery patients in the U.S., EU, Canada and South
Africa. Expansion of enrollment is expected to extend Biopure's schedule for
filing a U.S. marketing application by several months, the company said.
Hemopure is a sterile oxygen therapeutic consisting of ultrapurified,
chemically-crosslinked bovine hemoglobin, formulated in a balanced salt
solution.

·CardioTech International (Woburn, Massachusetts) has completed clinical studies
and has applied for CE mark for its second-generation Vasculink Vascular Access
graft coated with heparin, a natural anticoagulant that acts to prevent unwanted
clotting inside the graft during surgical implantation. The heparin is
covalently bonded onto the graft's inner surface by means of a patented process
licensed to CardioTech for vascular grafts by PolyBiomed (Sheffield, United
Kingdom).The company says that this advanced bonding technique permits heparin
to remain pharmacologically active for up to three weeks, compared to a few
hours for current heparin coatings. CardioTech expects to complete the CE
marking process for the graft in 3Q00.

·Cell Robotics (Albuquerque, New Mexico), a maker of medical and scientific
laser devices, has received CE mark approval for the Personal Lasette. The
Personal Lasette is a miniature laser finger perforator that allows diabetics to
draw blood to test blood glucose levels with minimal pain, no residual soreness
and eliminates the cause of needle phobia. According to the company, the Lasette
is the only FDA-cleared alternative to the steel lancet for drawing capillary
blood.

·Datex-Ohmeda (Tewsbury, Massachusetts) and Mortara Instruments (Milwaukee,
Wisconsin) received FDA clearance for the Datex-Ohmeda S/5 Telemetry System, a
product of their joint collaboration. The companies say the system offers a
diagnostic quality, 12-lead electrocardiograph (ECG). The S/5 Telemetry System
will be available to customers later this year. System 5 is a family of products
designed to simplify the anesthesia and critical care environment by offering
integration of a wide range of products and services. Mortara Instruments make
products for non-invasive cardiology. Datex-Ohmeda is a supplier of anesthesia
equipment and services, its products including patient monitoring systems for
anesthesia and intensive care units, anesthesia machines, critical care
ventilators and clinical information systems.

·IntraTherapeutics (St. Paul, Minnesota) has received FDA 510(k) clearance to
market a new stent length of the IntraCoil Bronchial Self-Expanding Nitinol
Endoprosthesis. The IntraCoil is now available in both 40 mm and 60 mm lengths.
The 60 mm IntraCoil comes in 4 mm to 7 mm diameters on a 135 cm catheter.
IntraTherapeutics is also conducting an Interventional Device Exemption clinical
trail on the IntraCoil for a superficial femoral artery and popliteal
indication. IntraTherapeutics makes devices for the treatment of vascular
disease and non-vascular obstructions.

·SIMS Deltec (St. Paul, Minnesota) has rolled out a new line of peripherally
inserted central catheters (PICC) and Midline catheters. The new CliniCath
PolyFlow catheters are made of polyurethane, which the company said allows a
smaller outer diameter for less vessel trauma and a larger inner diameter
providing optimal flow rates for a wide variety of short- and long-term I.V.
infusion therapies. Deltec makes infusion and access systems for domestic and
international markets and is part of Smiths Industries Medical Systems (London).

Regional Report / Seniors may receive refunds for ill-advised annuities

BYLINE: Pioneer Press

SECTION: INTL BIZ BRIEFING

LENGTH: 557 words


Thousands of Minnesota seniors with money tied up in "unsuitable" long-term
deferred annuities could be in line for a refund.

On Wednesday, Minnesota Attorney General Lori Swanson said she settled a lawsuit
filed early this year against Aviva USA Corp. and AmerUs Life Insurance Co. The
lawsuit accused Aviva/AmerUs of selling seniors products without properly
disclosing that the annuity would tie up big chunks of their life savings for
long periods.

Under the settlement, 4,500 policies with an estimated value of $250 million are
eligible for a refund. Minnesotans 65 and older who purchased a deferred annuity
from Aviva or AmerUs after Jan. 1, 2001, will receive a letter from the attorney
general's office and Aviva/AmerUs. Those whose claims are approved will get a
refund of their premium plus 4.15 percent interest.FDA lifts Boston Scientific
restrictions

Boston Scientific said Wednesday the Food and Drug Administration has lifted
some restrictions imposed for more than two years due to quality control
problems.

Natick, Mass.-based Boston Scientific makes heart stents in Maple Grove and
Plymouth, where the company employs about 3,000 people locally.

In 2006, the FDA issued the company a rare "corporate warning letter," which
barred the approval of significant new products. Boston Scientific Chief
Executive Jim Tobin said the agency has lifted the ban on product approvals. The
formal letter remains in place due to issues surrounding the company's reporting
of complaints and malfunctions of its devices. Tobin told analysts on an
earnings call the company was actively working to resolve those issues.Medtronic
to launch new stent graft

Fridley-based Medtronic Inc. announced the U.S. market launch of the
FDA-approved Talent Thoracic Stent Graft on the Xcelerant Delivery System, which
makes minimally invasive treatment of thoracic aortic aneurysms easier to
perform. A thoracic aortic aneurysm is a bulge or weakness in the main artery
extending from the heart that affects about 10 of every 100,000 elderly people
in the United States. Thoracic endovascular aortic repair is a minimally
invasive procedure in which a stent graft is threaded through the femoral artery
and expanded at the site of the aneurysm. The stent graft then creates a path
for blood flow, reducing pressure on the aneurysm and the risk of rupture.Court
allows Medtronic use of catheters

Medtronic Inc. said it won a U.S. patent case against Abbott Laboratories,
giving it access to the most-used catheter for heart-stent operations.

A federal district court in Oakland, Calif., ruled that the injunction barring
Medtronic from using Abbott's rapid-exchange catheter be lifted on Oct. 29, the
Fridley-based company said Wednesday in a statement.

The victory may boost Medtronic's share of the $1.9 billion U.S. market for
drug-coated stents by almost a third and allow the company's Endeavour model to
be sold with the same catheters used by rivals Abbott, Boston Scientific Corp.
and Johnson & Johnson, William Hawkins, Medtronic's chief executive officer,
said in August. Abbott Park, Ill.-based Abbott, which owns the patent for the
catheter, may appeal the court ruling.

Briefly

Syntiron LLC, a St. Paul-based vaccine discovery company, said it was notified
of a pending $3.8 million contract from the Defense Threat Reduction Agency.

US Patent granted to Medtronic Vascular, Inc. (California) on December 30 titled
as "Endovascular delivery system having textile component for implant restraint
and delivery"

LENGTH: 253  words

DATELINE: ALEXANDRIA, Va


United States Patent and Trademark Office has granted patent no. 8,920,481, on
December 30, 2014, to Medtronic Vascular, Inc. (California), titled as
"Endovascular delivery system having textile component for implant restraint and
delivery"

Inventors:  Stiger; Mark (Windsor, CA)
Assignee:  Medtronic Vascular, Inc. (Santa Rosa, CA)

According to the abstract released by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office: "A
stent-graft delivery system is disclosed having an outer tubular shaft or sheath
with a relatively stiff proximal segment and a distal segment formed from a
tubular textile component. The proximal segment being formed from a polymeric
tubing and having a distal end attached to a proximal end of the tubular textile
component. During tracking of the delivery system through the vasculature, a
self-expanding stent-graft is constrained by and within the tubular textile
component in a compressed delivery configuration. Upon positioning at a
treatment site, such as an aneurysm, retraction of the outer tubular shaft
proximally slides the tubular textile component over the stent-graft to expose
and deploy the stent-graft. The tubular textile component may be made from
strands of one or more biocompatible materials that have been formed into a
textile by weaving, braiding, knitting, crocheting, felting or a combination
thereof."

The patent was filed on April 20, 2009 Application no. 12/426,431

The pioneering transplant surgeon who won Nobel prize;
OBITUARIES Joseph Murray

SECTION: NEWS REVIEW;FEATURES; Pg. 8

LENGTH: 443 words


Joseph Murray, who has died aged 93, carried out the world's first successful
organ transplant, revolutionising the treatment of acute illness. His first
success in the field came in 1954, when he transplanted a kidney between
identical twins. Eight years later he performed the same feat between two
unrelated individuals - achievements for which in 1990 he shared the Nobel prize
in physiology or medicine with the bone marrow transplant pioneer Donnall
Thomas.

Until 1954 attempts to transplant living tissue from one human to another had
failed because of the rejection of the transplanted tissue by the recipients'
immune systems. In the absence of immunosuppressants, transplant operations
generally ended up killing the transplanted tissue, and often the patient.
Murray's interest in transplants developed when he was in the US army medical
corps during the Second World War. He was assigned to Valley Forge General
Hospital in Pennsylvania, which specialised in performing reconstructive surgery
on servicemen.

One patient in particular intrigued him.

Charles Woods was a pilot who had been badly burnt in a crash and needed 18
months of reconstructive surgery and skin grafts. As his body would reject
tissue transplanted from a donor, doctors had to relocate small patches of skin
from Woods's own body in each operation and use skin taken from dead bodies as
temporary protection on his open wounds.

Murray noticed that, instead of destroying these foreign grafts within the usual
eight to 10 days, Woods's immune system took a month. Studying his medical
records, he realised that Woods's weakened state had slowed his body's rejection
of the transplanted skin. He found another clue when the hospital's chief of
plastic surgery, who had performed skin grafts on civilians before the war, told
him he had noticed that the closer the donor and recipient were related, the
slower the tissue was rejected. In 1937 a skin graft between identical twins had
taken permanently.

After the war Murray moved to Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston, where,
practising on dogs, he pioneered techniques involving the reconnection of
nerves, tissues and blood vessels and carried out a number of successful kidney
transplants on the animals.

In 1954 the opportunity to operate on a human patient presented itself in the
form of Richard Herrick, a 23-year-old dying of chronic nephritis, who happened
to have an identical twin brother who was willing to donate a kidney. The
operation, carried out on December 23, went without a hitch. As the new kidney
turned a healthy pink, "there were grins all around" in the operating room,
Murray recalled.

* * * * * * * * * * DESCRIPTION * * * * * * * * * *

   Biocoral Inc., incorporated on May 4, 1992, is a company specializing in
research and development and commercialization of biomaterials, biomedical
technologies and biotechnologies. The Company through its subsidiaries
researches, develops, manufactures and markets bone graft and other bone growth
products for orthopedic, oral and maxillofacial applications to a number of
countries outside the United States. The company has also developed fully
autologous biological glue. It has also completed the final stages of
development of its product for treatment of bone fractures associated to
osteoporosis and is continuing to work on prevention of such fractures.

   The Company' s product Biocoral is a biomaterial containing Calcium Carbonate
(greater than 98%) derived from Natural Coral and is used as a bone graft
substitute. Biocoral ensures bone regeneration by its affinity to bone cells and
its interconnected porosity similar to cancellous bone. Biocoral is the only
natural wholly mineral bone graft substitute having a porous architecture, which
is formed from naturally occurring aragonite crystal with three-dimensional
interconnectivity allowing for optimum formation of new bone. Biocoral
bioactivity, together with its osteoconductive and osteophilic properties,
induces specific biological activity in the recipient bone, similar to the
physiological natural bone metabolism. This activity leads to graduate
resorption of Biocoral by osteoclasts and its replacement by osteoblasts in
newly formed bone. Biocoral is recommended as a bone graft for filling and bone
regeneration, interposition, apposition and for all bone graft substitution in
orthopedic surgery, neurosurgery, maxillofacial surgery, and oral surgery.

Medtronic receives FDA approval for Valiant Captivia thoracic stent graft system

SECTION: DEALERS; Regulatory Approvals

LENGTH: 380 words



HIGHLIGHT: Medtronic has received approval from the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) for the Valiant Captivia thoracic stent graft system to be
used in the treatment of type B aortic dissections.


Type B aortic dissection is a serious cardiovascular condition associated with
high morbidity and mortality in which the upper segment of the body's main
artery has become torn along the innermost layer of the vessel wall.

Supported by the results of the US Medtronic Dissection trial, the new
indication expands treatment options for this challenging patient population by
providing physicians with a minimally invasive alternative to open surgical
repair and medical therapy.

University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia professor of surgery and director of
the thoracic aortic surgery program and a national principal investigator for
Dissection Dr Joseph Bavaria noted acute type B aortic dissection is a
potentially life-threatening condition that historically has been treated with
either medical therapy or, when necessary, through invasive surgical techniques.

"The trial we conducted shows that endovascular repair with the Valiant Captivia
System provides a safe, effective and potentially life-saving treatment option
for acute dissection patients," Bavaria added.

Presented by Dr Bavaria on 27 January 2014 at the 2014 annual meeting of the
Society for Thoracic Surgery, 12-month data from the 50 patients evaluated in
Dissection demonstrate safety and efficacy of the Valiant captivia system in the
treatment of dissections, with excellent technical success.

Conducted at 16 US sites, the trial met its primary safety endpoint by achieving
an 8% all-cause mortality rate at 30 days, which represents a three- to
four-fold mortality improvement over open surgical repair. Additionally, 100%
technical success and 100% coverage of the primary entry tear at implant were
achieved in the trial.

Indicated for a variety of thoracic aortic lesions, the Valiant captivia system
features a unique proximal tip-capture mechanism, which enables controlled
deployment and accurate placement of the stent graft. Based on independent
conformability bench testing of multiple thoracic stent grafts, the Valiant
stent graft is the only device that maintains complete apposition to the vessel
wall regardless of angulation or oversizing.

Since its initial 2005 launch in Europe, the Valiant stent graft has been
implanted in about 50,000 patients worldwide -- more than any device of its
kind.

Protecting lime trees during the winter and grafting tree rootstock

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. B3

LENGTH: 489 words


Q. Can I graft a fruit tree branch onto a Siberian elm root stock?

Lee G.

A. I like the way you think. As readily as the Siberian elm grows in our soil
and climate, it would be wonderful if we could turn them into fruit bearing
trees. Alas, even though the idea is great, the science works against us. The
scion (variety that is grafted onto the rootstock) must be compatible with the
rootstock.

Siberian elms are not graft compatible with fruit trees. It will not be possible
for you to graft apple, pear, plum, cherry, or any other fruit to the elm.
Neither can you graft nuts such as pecan or walnut to the elm rootstock.

As I read your question my mind went back to a report of a laboratory in which
alfalfa was grafted to sunflower. These should not be graft compatible, but in a
laboratory setting it was accomplished successfully. Generally, plants must be
closely related, in the same species or genus to be compatible for grafting.
Sunflowers and alfalfa are not even in the same plant family, so they should not
be compatible for grafting. Some members of the genus Prunus (cherries, plums,
almonds, etc.) will not graft to other plants within the genus Prunus, and they
are more closely related than alfalfa and sunflowers. So, the topic of which
plant can be grafted to which other plant can be complicated, but fruit will not
(outside a laboratory) be successfully grafted to elm rootstocks.

I still like the way you think. Continue being creative. And if you decide to
try it and it does work, I really want to know. Science says it will fail.

Q. This question probably comes up every year at this time, but I need
information on how to protect my lime tree. I planted it planted 6 months ago.
Information regarding how to protect it would be helpful for the winter months.
I have seen various suggestions, but I would appreciate your advice.

Jack C.

A. I am assuming that you are gardening in Southern New Mexico since that is the
only part of the state with any chance of growing citrus. I discussed your
question with Jeff Anderson, NMSU Extension Service County Agent in Doña Ana
County. He told me that there are some Mandarin orange varieties that may
survive the winter in warmer microclimates in Southern New Mexico, but the lime
tree is tropical and cannot survive the winter anywhere in New Mexico.

With a lime tree (and most other citrus such as oranges, grapefruit, and lemons)
you will need to overwinter the plants indoors in an atrium or other sunny,
non-freezing location. That means you should dig up your lime tree and put it in
a pot if it is to have any chance of surviving in New Mexico.

   Datascope Corp. is a diversified medical device company that develops,
manufactures and markets products for clinical health care markets in
interventional cardiology and radiology, cardiovascular and vascular surgery,
and critical care. The Company has two segments: Cardiac Assist Products and
Vascular Products. The Cardiac Assist segment accounts for 87% of total sales
during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2008 (fiscal 2008). The Cardiac Assist
Products segment sells intra-aortic balloon (IAB) pumps and catheters,
endoscopic vessel harvesting products and the Safeguard assisted pressure
device. Its IAB pump system is used in the treatment of cardiac shock, acute
heart failure, irregular heart rhythms, and for cardiac support in open-heart
surgery, coronary angioplasty, and stenting. The balloon catheter serves as the
pumping device within the patient' s aorta. The Vascular Products segment sells
a line of knitted and woven polyester vascular grafts and patches for
reconstructive vascular and cardiovascular surgery, peripheral vascular stent
products, and stent grafts. Effective May 1, 2008, Datascope Corp. sold its
Patient Monitoring (PM) business to Mindray Medical International Limited. On
August 6, 2008, it completed the sale of assets related to the VasoSeal,
On-Site, and X-Site vascular closure devices, and its collagen operations to St.
Jude Medical, Inc.

   Cardiac Assist

   The Company provides IAB counterpulsation, which is used to support and
stabilize heart function. IAB therapy is also used for high-risk patients who
require revascularization procedures, such as percutaneous coronary
interventions or coronary artery bypass procedures, including both on-pump and
off-pump techniques. These products and therapy may be used before or during
coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous coronary interventions for
hemodynamic support.

   The Company produces a line of disposable intra-aortic balloon catheters that
serve as the pumping device within the patient' s aorta. CS300 balloon pump is
an automatic pump with all the features of Datascope' s CS100 balloon pump. The
CS100 automatic IABP includes IntelliSync automated arrhythmia tracking and
timing algorithms. The System 98XT IABP incorporates the CardioSync 2 software
with improved algorithms to provide enhanced counterpulsation therapy.

   Using fiber optic technology, the Sensation 7 Fr. offers the smallest
diameter IAB, as well as blood pressure monitoring with greater convenience and
higher fidelity blood pressure waveform than conventional invasive blood
pressure monitoring. Linear 7.5 Fr., with a Durathane membrane and improved 7.5
Fr. introducer sheath, offers easier insertion, abrasion resistance and improved
fatigue resistance and is ideal for smaller adults, diabetics and patients with
peripheral vascular disease.

   Fidelity IAB catheter offers central lumen for consistent, clear arterial
waveforms, which results in enhanced delivery of counterpulsation therapy for
the patient and patient management for the healthcare provider. In addition, the
Company manufactures a line of intra-aortic balloon catheters to accommodate
counterpulsation therapy in both the adult and pediatric population.

   Endoscopic Vessel Harvesting (EVH) devices enable less-invasive techniques
for the harvesting of suitable vessels for use in conjunction with coronary
artery bypass grafting. The Company' s EVH product line consists of the
ClearGlide procedural kits for saphenous vein and radial artery harvesting.

   Vascular Products

   The Company' s InterVascular, Inc. subsidiary designs, manufactures and
distributes a line of knitted and woven polyester vascular grafts and patches
for reconstructive vascular and cardiovascular surgery. Vascular grafts are used
to replace or bypass diseased arteries, and is marketed under the InterGard
brand, which include knitted collagen coated grafts for use in most vascular
applications for reconstruction of abdominal aorta and peripheral arteries and
woven products designed primarily for use in thoracic aortic repair and
open-heart surgery. InterGard Silver is antimicrobial vascular graft designed to
prevent post-operative, graft-related infection by using the spectrum,
anti-microbial properties of silver, which is released from the surface of the
graft into surrounding tissues following implantation.

   The Company' s InterGard Heparin is a heparin bonded, collagen coated graft
for replacement and bypass of peripheral arteries. Its line of vascular patches,
the InterVascular HemaPatch and HemaCarotid Patch products, offer the vascular
surgeon a range of knitted, collagen coated patches in a range of sizes for
repair of carotid and peripheral arteries. HemaPatches are available in the
Silver configuration and HemaCarotid patches are also manufactured in the
UltraThin configuration, with and without Heparin. The Company' s Vascular Stent
products include Peripheral Stents, Balloon Catheters, VI Aorto UniFemoral
StentGraft and VI Extender Cuff.

New Skin Treatment Offers Hope to Diabetic Patients

BYLINE: WXMI-TV, Grand Rapids, Mich.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 393 words


Feb. 16--We hear a lot about diabetes, and how the number of people who suffer
from it is on the rise. One major complication associated with the disease is
amputation.

Every year in the United States, more than 65,000 people lose a limb because of
diabetes due to a cut doesn't heal.

Now there is hope:  it's a new therapy that involves a patch made from of human
skin cells.

Eighty-eight year old Garrett Adema knows all too well how devastating a wound
that won't heal can be.

"I had it on the other foot," says Adema, "I had the same type of sore on the
big toe and they removed the big toe."

It's  a scenario dr. Marisha Stawiski sees time and time again in her patients
with diabetes.

"If you can't heal the wound, if it becomes deeper or gets infected it's
catastrophic to your limb."

When two sores developed on Adema's ankle, he wasn't taking any chances.

Stawiski recommended Dermagraft, a skin substitute made from human cells that
are taken from newborn foreskin tissue. Those cells are called fibroblasts.

"Fibroblasts are cells that we all have in our skin that produce really high
levels of healing factors that are important to stimulating the cascade of
healing," Stawiski told FOX 17.

The living fibroblasts are on a dissolvable mesh patch that adheres right to the
wound.

"It's basically just a scaffold for those fibroblasts to come in and make
themselves a home so they can do what they have to do."

The mesh is gradually absorbed, and those cells grow and replace the damaged
skin.

The graft is chryo-preserved, so it has to be thawed in water, then carefully
prepped before it is applied.

Adema has had three grafts so far, and the difference is remarkable. Since the
sore is so much smaller now, only a small part of the graft is needed.

The graft is held in place with a veil, bandaged up, and kept in place for a
full week. Adema  may need one or possibly two more grafts, but his wound is
expected to be completely healed in a few weeks, rather than the 7 or 8 months
it would normally take.

For Adema., no more wound means no more worries.

"It's working -- I'm very very happy today to see how well it has changed."

The treatment is pricey, each graft costs $1,500, but it's covered by most
insurance carriers.

Lombard Medical Acquires Endovascular Stent Graft Developer Altura Medical

LENGTH: 699  words


July 30 -- Lombard Medical, Inc. (NASDAQ:EVAR), a medical device company focused
on endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs),
today announced the acquisition of Silicon Valley-based Altura Medical, a
privately-held, venture-backed company that has developed an innovative
ultra-low profile endovascular stent graft technology that offers a simple and
predictable solution for the treatment of standard AAA anatomies.

The terms of the transaction include the issuance of $15 million of Lombard
common stock at $4 per share (3,750,000 shares of Lombard common stock subject
to certain lock up conditions), the assumption of $5.5 million in bank debt and
$2.5 million in certain liabilities and transaction-related costs.

In addition, up to $27.5 million may be paid based on the achievement of certain
commercial and regulatory milestones anticipated over the next five years. Under
the terms of the agreement, Lombard has the option to pay the additional
consideration in either cash or stock.

The Altura endograft system received CE Mark in 2015 and Lombard plans to launch
the device in Europe in January 2016 with a broader international roll out later
the same year. In the U.S., Lombard intends to file for an IDE (Investigational
Device Exemption) from the U.S. FDA in early 2016 with the intent to begin
recruitment for a U.S. clinical study later in 2016.

Lombard CEO Simon Hubbert said, "The acquisition of Altura and the launch of its
new AAA stent graft will provide a near-term and substantial increase in
revenues. In fact, we believe this innovative technology could account for up to
20 percent of our 2016 total revenue. The combination of Altura's technology
with our flagship Aorfix platform creates a truly patient driven platform that
we believe will allow us to capture share from our competitors. The Altura
device offers a simple, safe and efficient treatment option for standard AAA
anatomy, while Aorfix offers the only on-label solution for patients with Aortic
neck angulation up to 90 degrees."

"The Altura device offers a new ultra-low profile stent graft system without
compromising the robustness and durability of the wire and graft fabric," said
Professor Dierk Scheinert, M.D., Chairman of the Division of Interventional
Angiology, University Hospital Leipzig, Germany. Noting that, "The added
benefits of this smart system are the ability to reposition during deployment
and place each graft accurately to each renal artery enabling physicians to
utilize all the available aortic neck. It also removes the need for cannulation
and therefore provides a simple, intuitive, safe and consistent deployment
system with predictable and shorter procedure times."

"Many patients who present for AAA repair can be treated quickly and efficiently
with minimal hospital stay and recovery times," said Stuart A. Harlin, M.D.,
board certified vascular surgeon, Coastal Vascular & Interventional, Pensacola,
FL. "The introduction of an easy-to-deploy AAA stent graft that offers enhanced
safety and accuracy on an ultra-low profile delivery system will allow
physicians to treat a large percentage of AAA patients more efficiently in the
future."

Conference Call

Lombard's management will discuss the acquisition and answer questions during a
conference call, which will include a slide presentation, beginning at 5:00 p.m.
Eastern Time today, Thursday, July 30, 2015. To join the call, participants may

BRIEF: Cook's new iliac artery graft gets approval

BYLINE: Rebecca Troyer, Herald-Times, Bloomington, Ind.

SECTION: BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS

LENGTH: 229 words


July 12--Cook Medical of Bloomington has received premarket approval from the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration for a new device used in iliac arteries of
patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms.

The Zenith Spiral-Z AAA Iliac Leg Graft is more flexible and kink-resistant than
previous Zenith products and features a nitinol (nickel and titanium) spiral
stent, according to a press release from Cook Medical. Stent grafts, which are
flexible wire tubes with a woven polyester material used in many surgical
applications, provide support at weak points in an artery. Cook's new device
will be used during endovascular aneurysm repair.

"Zenith Spiral-Z provides physicians with Cook's most kink-resistant and
trackable iliac leg graft to date," said Phil Nowell, vice president of Cook
Medical's Aortic Intervention division, in the release.

Cook Medical, a global company with its headquarters in Bloomington,
manufactures devices used in minimally invasive medical procedures.

Applicant: Yale University   New Haven   CT   US (Connecticut)

According to the abstract released by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office:
"Methods for treating or preventing neointima stenosis are disclosed. The
methods generally involve the use of a TGF.beta. inhibitor, a SMAD2 inhibitor,
an FGF Receptor agonist, a Let-7 agonist, or a combination thereof, to inhibit
endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (Endo-MT) of vascular endothelial cells
into smooth muscle cells (SMC) at sites of endothelial damage. The disclosed
methods can therefore be used to prevent or inhibit neointimal stenosis or
restenosis, e.g., after angioplasty, vascular graft, or stent. Also disclosed
are methods for increasing the patency of biodegradable, synthetic vascular
grafts using a composition that inhibits Endo-MT. A cell-free tissue engineered
vascular graft (TEVG) produced by this method is also disclosed."

REGiMMUNE starts Phase II study of RGI-2001 for treatment of Graft-versus-host
disease

SECTION: ANALYTICAL APPLICATIONS; Product Developments

LENGTH: 500 words



HIGHLIGHT: Japan-based REGiMMUNE has initiated a Phase II trial of its
proprietary compound RGI-2001 for Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD) associated
with haematopoietic stem cell transplantation.


Japan-based REGiMMUNE has initiated a Phase II trial of its proprietary compound
RGI-2001 for Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD) associated with haematopoietic
stem cell transplantation.

The randomised, open-label, multicentre Phase II trial is being conducted in
patients undergoing allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT).

The trial is being carried out in six highly regarded US cancer centres, the
Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Stanford University Medical Center, the
Ohio State University Medical Center, University of California, San Diego,
Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard University and University of Miami
Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center.

The start of the trial follows a successful completion of a Phase I trial in
patients with bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation leukemia
patients following chemotherapy.

REGiMMUNE president and chief executive officer Haru Morita said: "Our
proprietary immune-regulating technology is initially being tested in the clinic
with RGI-2001 to demonstrate its potential as an effective treatment to prevent
graft rejection, without the risks associated with current therapies."

The main aim of the company is to develop new and proprietary products focused
on therapeutic areas that can be addressed with immune-regulating technology
including type 1 diabetes, celiac disease, and inhibitor formation in enzyme
replacement therapies (ERT) such as haemophilia and lysosomal diseases.

The RGI-2001 trial is the expansion of the company's Phase I dose-escalation
trial to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile of the drug
candidate in patients undergoing AHSCT, with radiation or non-radiation
myeloablative preparative treatment.

REGiMMUNE said that the expansion phase will further assess the pharmacologic
effects of either a maximum tolerated dose, maximum feasible dose or optimal
pharmacologically active dose of RGI-2001.

The Phase II trial will expand the enrolment criteria from Phase I and allow
transplantation by either related or unrelated donors.

It is designed to identify the dose range RGI-2001 has an acceptable safety
profile, where biologic activity is observed, and to guide possible dose levels
to use in later phase studies based on biological activity.

According to the company, results from the Phase I trial showed very clean
safety profile with no safety concerns observed up to the highest cohort.

RGI-2001 is a liposomal formulation of KRN7000, a synthetic derivative of
alpha-galactosylceramide, which uses the company's reVax technology, promotes
transplantation tolerance by inducing regulatory T (Treg) cells that has been
shown to have significant potential for treating GvHD.

According to studies carried out by independent researchers, Treg has proven to
produce longer patient survival because it reduces rejection without reducing an
anti-tumour graft versus leukaemia (GvL) effect.

Daily M&A: LeMaitre Vascular acquires Xenotis for $7.7 million

LENGTH: 398 words


LeMaitre Vascular (Burlington, Massachusetts) reported that it has acquired
Australia-based Xenotis, the manufacturer of the Omniflow II biological graft
for peripheral bypass and dialysis access for $7.7 million.

The product is to be implanted in patients getting below-the-knee bypass surgery
when there is no vein graft available. The product has been implanted 20,000
times since 1990, according to a statement from LeMaitre.

LeMaitre, which had 334 employees as of the end of last year, paid $5.1 million
at the closing, will pay another $1.4 million next August for the 10-employee
company, and assumed its bank debt of $1.2 million.

LeMaitre hopes that Xenotis graft will make a good complement to its vascular
portfolio, which includes the XenoSure bovine vascular patch. The company said
the buy is part of a larger strategy to acquire "under-marketed" devices.

LeMatre also said that the product should benefit from its vascular-only sales
channel, particularly in Europe where Xenotis has used independent distributors.

The $2.3 million Xenotis reported in sales in the fiscal year ended June 2014
would have been worth $3.4 million through LeMaitre's sales channel, the company
added.

In other M&A news:

Prime Healthcare (Ontario, California) has completed its acquisition of St.
Mary's Hospital(Passaic, New Jersey).

Prime Healthcare is committed to investing more than $80 million into St Mary's
Hospital, which serves Passaic, Clifton, Wallington, Carlstadt, Rutherford/East
Rutherford, and many other surrounding towns.

St. Mary's Hospital is a non-profit, community-based tertiary medical center. It
is an acute care hospital providing a broad range of cardiovascular services as
well as a comprehensive program for cancer care. St. Mary's Hospital is also a
center of excellence for maternal-child health and outpatient behavioral health
services. With over 550 physicians and 1,200 employees, it is one of the largest
employers in the county.

o Valeant Pharmaceuticals (Laval, Quebec), said it extended the expiration of
its exchange offer to acquire all the outstanding shares of Allergan (Irvine,
California0, to 5 p.m. New York time on Dec. 31, 2014. It previously had been
set to expire at 5 p.m. New York time on Aug. 15. All other terms remain
unchanged. Valeant has offered a bid for Allergan valued at about $53 billion;
Allergan has maintained that the price is too low.

JPP MYSTERY IS EXPLODING Big Blue reps fail in attempt to visit hurt Giant in
hospital

BYLINE: BY JUSTIN TASCH NEW YORK DAILY NEWS With Christian Red

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 49

LENGTH: 956 words


A CONTINGENT of Giants officials, including vice president of medical services
Ronnie Barnes, traveled to Miami on Monday to check on Jason Pierre-Paul at
Jackson Memorial Hospital, where the Giants defensive end is believed to have
undergone surgery after injuring his hand in a fireworks accident July 4, but
the team still hadn't seen the 26-year-old player as of Tuesday afternoon.

Details of Pierre-Paul's condition remained sketchy, but it appeared that he
wouldn't be charged with violating Florida's law prohibiting recreational use of
most fireworks. The Broward County Sheriff's Office told the Daily News on
Tuesday that it is not investigating the incident. The Coral Springs Police
Department had begun to look into whether a law had been violated, but
determined through Pierre-Paul's representatives that the accident didn't occur
in Coral Springs and is no longer investigating, according to Capt. Brad McKeon.

Bleacher Report reported Tuesday afternoon that Pierre-Paul had a skin graft
procedure to repair damage to his hand but that the Giants don't believe the
player has nerve damage. It is unclear, however, if he will have to be placed on
the non-football injury (NFI) list at the start of training camp on July 30.

According to Dr. David Greenhalgh, the chief of burn surgery for Shriners
Hospital for Children Northern California & UC Davis Medical Center, doctors
categorize burn injuries from first degree (least severe) to fourth degree.
Third degree burns are commonly treated using skin grafts, Greenhalgh said.

"We cut away all the dead tissue down to live tissue, usually fat, take skin
from another part of body, close that area with an incision, and attach the skin
to the area where you've removed dead tissue," said Greenhalgh. "A firework burn
to the palm - you would possibly do a skin graft. The good thing for a palm burn
is that it's very thick skin, so it has a better chance of healing on its own
than a thin part of the body, like an area on the back of a hand. An athlete who
uses his hand a lot has got a thick callous, and will do better. It depends on
how hot the agent (firework) was, how long he was in contact with it and how
thick the skin is."

While a decision on whether to place Pierre-Paul on the NFI list will depend on
the ultimate condition of his hand after a full team evaluation; one team source
said that placing him on the NFI list is already "a strong consideration."

Pierre-Paul likely would have to sign his one-year, $14.8 million franchise
tender before camp starts, which would allow the Giants to place him on the NFI
list when camp opens. That money would not be guaranteed for what is clearly a
non-football injury and he would not be paid while on that list.

If Pierre-Paul goes on the list and isn't activated before Week 1 of the regular
season, he would have to remain on it through the first six weeks. After that,
the team would have three weeks to either activate him or place him on injured
reserve. He would not be taking up an active roster spot while on the list.

Pierre-Paul could also opt to not sign his franchise tender until he's ready to
play, which would prevent the Giants from placing him on the NFI list since he
would not be under contract. He wouldn't be paid either way until he's ready to
play, so not signing would allow Pierre-Paul the power to dictate his return as
long as the franchise tender remains on the table.

A spokeswoman at Jackson Memorial told The News on Tuesday that Pierre-Paul's
family has requested privacy and couldn't provide any other information. A
source had previously told The News that Pierre-Paul suffered serious burns on
three fingers and part of one hand, along with some minor injuries to his other
hand.

There are many reasons the Giants were desperate for a prognosis on
Pierre-Paul's hands. Of course, there is simply his "well-being," as a Giants
spokesman said. Time is also ticking on the July 15 deadline to come to terms on
a new contract with players assigned the franchise tag. A team source told The
News' Ralph Vacchiano on Monday there is "no chance" Pierre-Paul gets a new deal
before that deadline in the wake of his fireworks accident.

If that deadline passes without an agreement, the sides cannot restart
negotiations until the end of the 2015 season.

That team source also said the Giants aren't considering rescinding
Pierre-Paul's franchise tag, a measure that would make him an unrestricted free
agent.

In an interview on Sirius XM Radio on Tuesday, Pierre-Paul's teammate, wide
receiver Victor Cruz, who is working his way back from a torn patellar tendon
suffered on the field during a game at Philadelphia in October, said the news of
Pierre-Paul's hand injury left him "shocked."

"I was definitely, obviously shocked just like everyone else to hear the news,"
Cruz told Bruce Murray and Rich Gannon. "Obviously it's not something that you
want to hear about a teammate. I have reached out to him; I sent him a text
message, but obviously he's probably nowhere near a phone right now. But I just
hope he's healthy.

"I just hope everything goes positively and that he's able to be with us come
training camp. That's the only thing a guy like myself can ask for right now."

Cruz, who said he has been running routes and making cuts, said that while the
training staff may limit his reps early on, he believes he will be ready to go
for the start of training camp and won't need to go on the physically unable to
perform (PUP) list.

"I don't think that PUP will be an option," Cruz said. "Obviously if it comes
about then that is a conversation that I'll have to have with my superiors. But
other than that it seems like I am on track to be ready for training camp and,
God-willing, be out there Week 1."

Editorial Observer;
Here's a Book Governor Pataki Should Read

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

SECTION: Section A;  Page 30;  Column 1;  Editorial Desk

LENGTH: 570 words


If George Pataki is on your Christmas list, but you haven't decided what to get
him, here is a suggestion. What he needs desperately to read is "Plunkitt of
Tammany Hall," a classic book on New York politics first published 93 years ago
and still in print in no fewer than four editions. It has some advice he can
use.

George Washington Plunkitt, who wrote the book with the assistance of a
journalist, was a state legislator and Democratic Party boss on the West Side of
Manhattan during the heyday of Tammany Hall, New York's powerful Democratic
machine. He was also a millionaire, having gotten rich both as a building
contractor with political pull and as a real estate investor who seemed to know
just where a city project would boost property values.

The centerpiece of this short book -- New York's Governor could easily read it
in one evening -- is Plunkitt's explanation of the difference between "honest
graft and dishonest graft." He had, he said, gotten rich from the honest kind,
including such things as being the only bidder when the city was selling excess
property such as paving stones.

Plunkitt took great pride in civic improvements, such as the establishment of
the Museum of Natural History, in which he played a role. He thought that so
long as the government was doing its job adequately, no one should be concerned
if the politicians made some money.

What was dishonest graft? He cited a scandal in Philadelphia. "A Republican
superintendent of the Philadelphia almshouse stole the roof off the buildin' and
sold it for junk," said Plunkitt. "That was carryin' things to excess."

No Tammany Hall boss would ever have done such a thing, said Plunkitt. Of
course, "if the roof was much worn, he might get the city authorities to put on
a new one and get the contract for it himself, and buy the old roof at a
bargain. But that's honest graft. It's goin' about the thing like a gentleman."
What was important was that the almshouse got a good roof.

What, one wonders, would Plunkitt say if he were here today and pondering the
scandal at New York City's School Construction Authority? He would shrug when
told that Paul Atanasio, a Pataki patronage appointee to the authority, appeared
to have arranged a job as construction superintendent for Gary Marrone, the
husband of Mr. Atanasio's secretary. Plunkitt, who despised civil service laws,
would have sneered when told that violated an anti-nepotism rule.

But he would have turned pale when he learned of the fate of Yan Zhen Zhao, a
16-year-old student who died in January when a brick fell on her head at a
construction site that Mr. Marrone was doing a horrendous job of supervising. A
new report by the city's Department of Investigation lays out a host of
violations of laws, rules and common sense at that construction site that made
it possible for that brick to hit her.

To Plunkitt, that would have sounded like dishonest graft. The politicians were
enriching themselves, which was fine, but they were not filling the public need.
As in Philadelphia, the public was worse off, not better, as a result of the
politicians.

Governor Pataki now is willing to give up that particular patronage appointment
at the School Construction Authority. But he has many more jobs to hand out. It
is to be hoped that in his second term he will do a better job of giving them to
people who are competent as well as well connected.

R.I. Supreme Court rules patient who discovered negligence 'late' can't sue MD

BYLINE: Rhode Island Lawyers Weekly Staff

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 956  words


A patient who did not discover her doctor's negligence until five years after
the surgical procedure could not bring a medical-malpractice suit against the
physician where she should have known about the negligence earlier, the Rhode
Island Supreme Court has decided.

The plaintiff patient argued that the statute of limitations was tolled until
she discovered - through a second doctor - that her surgeon had negligently made
a graft misplacement while performing anterior cruciate ligament surgery.

But the court disagreed and affirmed the ruling of the lower court judge.

"Although [the patient] may not have known of the specific graft misplacement,
we hold that a reasonable person should have known of the negligence at an
earlier date," Chief Justice Frank J. Williams wrote on behalf of the court.

Williams added that "it is sufficient to note that the statute of limitations in
this case began running at the time a patient who had undergone a non-negligent
ACL surgery would have stopped feeling pain. The misplaced graft, while itself
undiscovered, was not undiscoverable. "

The 12-page decision is Hanson, et al. v. Singsen, Lawyers Weekly No. 60-090-06.

R. Park Palmer Jr. of Providence represented the plaintiff patient. Robert P.
Landau of Providence was the lawyer for the defendant doctor.

Slippery clam shell

In 1990, the plaintiff, Virginia Hanson, tore her ACL after slipping on a clam
shell while on duty as a federal police officer in Newport.

She sought medical treatment from the defendant, Dr. Edwin Singsen, who met with
her shortly after the accident and ultimately performed ACL reconstruction
surgery in March 1990.

During the surgery, the defendant implanted a Dacron graft in her knee.

The patient experienced continued pain after surgery and repeatedly sought the
doctor's assistance. After performing a manipulation of the knee, she suffered
additional motion loss. When she asked what she should do, the doctor told her
the pain was in her head.

Humiliated by the defendant's words, the plaintiff switched doctors, but did not
suspect at the time that he had done anything wrong in surgery.

After meeting with another doctor, the plaintiff tried to make an appointment to
see a specialist in Boston.

Over the next few years, the plaintiff unsuccessfully sought permission from the
U.S. Department of Labor's Office of Workers' Compensation Programs to see a
specialist.

Her new doctor also wrote to the OWC advising that she should have an
arthroscope and an MRI to see if there was any impingement, abnormal tissue or
reaction in her knee.

Although the plaintiff and her new doctor continued writing letters to the OWC,
her requests were not granted, and she further was informed that if she saw
another doctor without the OWC's permission, she would lose her benefits.

Despite continuing pain and limited mobility, she continued to await permission
from the OWC, which she eventually received in December 1995.

The specialist ordered X-rays and an MRI and ultimately performed an arthroscopy
of her knee.

The specialist told her that the MRI revealed that her original doctor had
misplaced the graft during ACL reconstruction surgery and attributed her
condition to "failed ACL surgery. "

He performed a second knee surgery on the plaintiff, which she said greatly
reduced her pain and allowed her to regain some motion.

The disputed facts concerning the eight years between the plaintiff's treatment
and the filing of her 1998 medical-malpractice suit against the defendant doctor
were presented to a jury in 2004.

The defendant made a motion at the conclusion of the case for judgment as a
matter of law on several grounds, including that the statute of limitations
barred recovery.

The trial judge granted the defendant's motion.

'Undiscovered' vs. 'undiscoverable'

In ruling in the defendant doctor's favor, Williams stated that the case turned
on when the patient should have discovered her doctor's negligence.

He cited several Rhode Island Supreme Court decisions that have held that the
discovery date is the date the patient knew or should have known of the wrongful
act that formed the basis of the lawsuit.

"If we determine that [the patient] should have known of the negligence at a
date earlier than her appointment with the specialist, then the applicable
three-year statute of limitations will bar the claim she filed in December
1998," he said. "In other words, an undiscovered act of negligence is not
necessarily an undiscoverable act of negligence for the purposes of tolling the
statute of limitations. "

Despite the patient's attempts to persuade the OWC to allow her to see a
specialist, Williams said that her efforts were not sufficient.

He added that extending the statute of limitations in this context would
prejudice the defendant.

"In effect, [she] ask[s] us to hold that a reasonable person receiving OWC
benefits would have allowed nearly five years to pass before seeing a
specialist, even after she was told that she needed an MRI and an arthroscopy.
We disagree," he said.

The law did not protect an individual in the patient's position, who allowed
five years to pass without discovering the cause of her injuries, Williams
wrote.

"[Her] fear of losing her benefits is understandable; however, it is simply not
reasonable for a person suffering a great deal of pain and immobility not to try
to see a specialist regardless of the OWC's consent," he said.

U.S. POLITICIANS ARE REAL EINSTEINS AT GUN CONTROL

SECTION: LIFE

LENGTH: 658 words



WHEN a McMaster University scientist examined Albert Einstein's brain, she
discovered that the part responsible for mathematical reasoning, the inferior
parietal region, was larger than the norm. It's not that Einstein's brain was
bigger than the average person's, but this section of it certainly was, which
meant Einstein's brilliance may have come at the expense of other things. For
example, the portion of the brain that recognizes when it's time to get a
haircut was squeezed right out.

This research parallels other work that's examining a slightly more contemporary
subject: the U.S. congressman. A study of the brains of several members of the
U.S. House of Representatives turned up some intriguing findings. (The
scientists found that removal of the brains from living congressmen did not
alter their lives or work performance in any significant way. Some, perhaps
taking their cue from the President, said it was not even their most important
organ.)

Evidently, the part of the brain responsible for memory could not be found in
U.S. congressmen.

Only two months after the Columbine High School massacre outside Denver, the
House of Representatives killed a gun-control bill that would have closed some
of the loopholes surrounding the purchase of weapons at weekend, flea
market-style gun shows. It was at these kinds of shows where the two student
killers added to their arsenal.

(Flea markets must be very different south of the border than they are up here.
I found a great deal once on a tea cozy[semi] in Tennessee or Idaho or Georgia I
could have got my hands on a Barrett .50-calibre 82A1 rifle, a military weapon
that can bring down low-flying aircraft and is accurate at more than a mile.)

Evidently, the Columbine event had slipped the minds of those in the House. This
is not hard to understand. High school shootouts are becoming so common, it's
hard to keep them all straight. It's not that these politicians don't care[semi]
they just lack the necessary brainpower to stay focused. The gray cells simply
aren't there.

Reporter: Congressman Graft, 14 students have been shot in your district this
week.

Graft: Oh dear God, that's awful!

Reporter: What can be done about this problem?

Graft: What problem?

Reporter: The 14 students shot in your district this week.

Graft: Oh dear God, that's awful!

The study did find, however, some notable exceptions. There was one key area
where congressmen were like elephants:

Lobbyist: Congressman Graft, it's been a couple of years, and you probably won't
remember me, but I'm with the National Rifle Association and . . .

Graft: Hey, I recognize that attache case! Did you remember to keep it all in
tens and twenties, like last time? And tell me, how's Chuck doing? I know his
phone number off by heart. Go ahead, ask me.

It's too bad the gun-control bill didn't get passed. It included some pretty
tough new regulations. For example, if you wanted to buy one of those anti-
aircraft guns (great for hunting squirrels), before you could walk out with it,
you'd first have to name three Charlton Heston movies, sign a statement saying
you weren't going to do anything mean with it, and submit to a background check
consisting primarily of bringing along a buddy who could say: ''He's an okay
guy, and I really like his sister.''

But despite what they've learned about the brains of congressmen, not all is
lost. Critics who suggest these politicians aren't concerned about guns in
schools should be aware they did stay alert long enough to do something. They
voted to allow the Ten Commandments to be posted on classroom walls. As long as
they're printed on stone tablets, students can use them as shields the next time
their classmates burst in with guns ablazing.

The U.S. House of Representatives. A real bunch of Einsteins, no doubt about it.

Surgery gave paraplegic woman limited ability to walk -- doctor: Nerve graft
surgery experimental, he says

SOURCE: AP

SECTION: World; Pg. A8

LENGTH: 452 words

DATELINE: Los Angeles

An experimental nerve-graft surgery allowed a paraplegic woman whose spinal cord
was severed in an automobile accident to reacquire limited use of her legs, an
Italian doctor reported this week at a conference in California.

In a 14-hour surgery performed in July 2000, Dr. Giorgio Brunelli, of the
Universita' di Brescia, Italy, removed a portion of the 28-year-old's sciatic
nerve and used it as a graft to connect the undamaged portion of her spine to
muscles in her buttocks and thighs. He said the graft allowed the regrowth of
nerves connected to the central nervous system into the muscle tissue.

The unidentified patient first showed movement in her legs in September and
since has begun walking with assistance, Brunelli said. The woman had used a
wheelchair for five years prior to the surgery.

"It is rudimentary walking -- she needs a walker -- but she can move," Brunelli
said in an interview Thursday.

Some doctors are skeptical about the procedure, said Dr. Wise Young of Rutgers
University, who has followed Brunelli's research.

Young said the permanent severing of the sciatic nerve guarantees a patient
loses use of the leg muscle -- something that may cause problems if better
treatments are eventually found.

"If the procedure fails, this is a very major loss. This concept (that) patients
have nothing to lose is terribly wrong," Young said. "One shouldn't assume we
will have no therapies for spinal cord injury forever -- and this is a
28-year-old woman."

Other spinal cord injury research being pursued includes the use of implantable
devices that provide electrical stimulation to promote nerve regrowth.

Another spinal cord expert criticized the surgery, never before performed in
humans, as ethically questionable.

"Unless you do a very controlled clinical trial, many times you get fooled,"
said M. Dalton Dietrich of The Miami Project to Cure Paralysis. "We shouldn't be
jumping the gun ... there is a major ethical question about doing these types of
procedures in people until there is compelling evidence this is the answer to
the problem."

Brunelli wrangled with a medical ethics board in Italy for several years before
he received approval to perform the operation. Brunelli said he has experimented
on more than 1,000 rats and 40 primates since 1980.

Brunelli stressed that the surgery is experimental, but said he plans to operate
on a second patient, a man injured in a November automobile accident, next
month.

"I will not give any illusions to patients," he said.

Brunelli presented his results, including a video that shows the woman walking,
on Wednesday at the San Diego meeting of the International Society of Orthopedic
Surgery and Traumatology.

San Juan vice mayor allowed to go abroad amid malversation rap

LENGTH: 695  words


The Sandiganbayan allowed outgoing San Juan Vice Mayor Francis Zamora to travel
to Los Angeles, California even as he faces a technical malversation charge for
the alleged anomalous use of calamity funds for high-powered firearms in 2008.

The anti-graft court issued the resolution on Tuesday allowing Zamora to travel
abroad after he underwent a conditional arraignment earlier in the day.

The court authorized Zamora to travel to Los Angeles, California from May 22 to
June 11 provided that he leaves the country not earlier than May 22 and return
not later than June 11.

The court said his itinerary should only cover Los Angeles, California and no
other place.

The court also instructed Zamora to pay a travel bond of P6,000 to ensure his
faithful compliance with the terms and conditions of the grant of travel.

Also, Zamora should report to the court about his travel five days after his
return to the country.

The court also said violating the terms and conditions of the resolution would
be a sufficient ground for the court to forfeit the travel bond and issue the
arrest warrant.

Zamora on Tuesday morning pleaded not guilty to technical malversation during
his conditional arraignment.

He was charged as part of the city council which approved the issuance of an
ordinance to allow the use of the calamity funds for high-powered firearms. He
was then a councilor.

Zamora is the son of Minority Leader San Juan Rep. Ronaldo Zamora.

Zamora pleaded not guilty in his arraignment, enabling the court to assume
jurisdiction over his case so that it could rule on his motion to travel abroad.

In an interview, Zamora said he pleaded not guilty because he said he should not
be charged with technical malversation because he was not an accountable officer
responsible for the disbursement of the calamity funds.

Definitely not guilty kasi hindi naman ako (because I was not an) accountable
officer. For someone who can be charged with graft he must be an accountable
officer, Zamora said.

Zamora recently lost his bid as Taguig mayor against former ally reelectionist
Taguig Mayor Guia Gomez, mother of Sen. Joseph Victor JV Ejercito.

Ejercito is the principal accused in the technical malversation case for being
San Juan mayor in 2008 when the purchase of high-powered rifles was made.

In the anti-graft court Fifth Division, Ejercito was separately charged with
graft for the alleged anomalous purchase of high-powered rifles worth P2.1
million using calamity funds.

Ejercito has posted bail.

Zamora denied being behind the charges as alleged by his political nemesis
Ejercito.

Common sense will tell you that we've also been charged, although not with graft
, unlike sa kanya (his case). Walang dahilan na pati kami masama (There is no
reason for us to be included), Zamora said.

That's absurd. In fact, we're also facing a legal battle because of him, he
added, referring to Ejercito.

According to the graft information, Ejercito conspired with other city officials
to purchase high-powered firearms in February 2008 using the city's calamity
fund as investment for disaster preparedness.

The city council which included Zamora then passed a city ordinance allowing
Ejercito to buy the firearms for the city's police department.

Ejercito approved the purchase although the city was not under a state of
calamity when the purchase was made.

The firearms bought using the city's calamity fund included three units of model
K2 cal. 5.56mm sub-machine guns and 17 units of Daewoo model K1 cal. 5.56 mm
sub-machine guns.

The purchase of the firearms was done with haste without competitive bidding and
without any post-qualification, bolstered by bid documents bearing dates earlier
than the publication of the invitation to bid, showing that an unwarranted
benefit, advantage and preference was accorded to the supplier, the prosecutors
said.

The Office of the Ombudsman cited the joint circular between the Departments of
Budget and Management and the Interior and Local Government which did not
include high-powered firearms among the items needed for disaster relief and
mitigation.

Ejercito, the son of former President and Manila Mayor Joseph Estrada, will have
a Senate term until 2019.

CardioTech hits milestone in synthetic CABG graft effort

CardioTech hits milestone in synthetic CABG graft effort

By HOLLAND JOHNSON  Medical Device Daily Associate Managing Editor  CardioTech
International (Woburn, Massachusetts) reported last week that the longest-living
patient with the company's CardioPass synthetic coronary artery bypass graft
(CABG), who was implanted last Aug. 6, has reached the critical six-month
post-surgery period.

The company said that the 68-year-old female, who also is diabetic, is living a
normal life.

CardioTech said that this is a milestone event, as the clinical data suggests
that the majority of clinical problems are encountered in the first six months
after implantation of the graft.

The company also said it believes that Thoratec's (Pleasanton, California)
announced withdrawal from its Aria coronary artery bypass clinical trials
earlier this month leave CardioTech as the only company in the world in active
development of a synthetic coronary artery bypass graft.

CardioTech said the synthetic saphenous vein addresses a potential annual market
of $1.5 billion.

Thoratec reported its intention to drop out of the synthetic CABG market during
an earnings conference call on its 4Q03 and fiscal 2003 financial report. "Over
the past year or two, we have discussed the challenges associated with clinical
trials in this area," Thoratec Chief Executive Officer Keith Grossman said in a
press release. "Based on the final results from our current feasibility clinical
trial in the United Kingdom, we have determined that we will not devote
additional resources to the development of the Aria graft, particularly given
the opportunities we feel we currently have in our ventricular assist device
business."

He added that the decision has no impact on previously provided financial
guidance, "as we had not anticipated any revenue contribution from the Aria in
the foreseeable future. It is only due to the somewhat anomalous accounting
treatment of our 2001 merger that we must recognize the costs of the Aria
discontinuation in this fashion."

Thoratec acquired the Aria assets when it merged with Thermo Cardiosystems
(Woburn, Massachusetts) in 2001.

CardioTech said that while it has voluntarily withdrawn from reporting on
individual patients, it will report when patient analysis is complete. This is
meant to comply with FDA regulations designed to prevent "marketing" of an
unapproved medical device, the company said.

"Normally we would not be commenting on the progress of CardioPass as a result
of our self-imposed blackout period to comply with the letter and spirit of all
applicable international laws," said Michael Szycher, PhD, chief executive
officer of CardioTech, in a statement. "But with the withdrawal of Thoratec from
the synthetic coronary artery bypass clinical trials, we felt compelled to
inform our shareholders and clinical investigators of our continuing commitment
to this program."

Szycher told Medical Device Daily that many medical device companies have tried
to come up with an artificial saphenous vein, "and every one of them has failed,
for a variety of reasons." He said that when going into something as small as a
coronary artery, "first you have the problem of acute thrombosis, and the [graft
] closes in the first week."  Generally, he noted that most companies couldn't
get past this stage.

The next problem that must be overcome, he said, is the longer-term issue of
anastomotic hyperplasia. "The polymers that people have used in the past have
not been compliant, that is to say they don't pulse the same way as in the
artery."

Szycher said that in his opinion, while Thoratec's Aria had an excellent
polymer, the construction of the graft was to blame for the failure of the
product. "They had a middle layer which was a solid layer, and therefore, the
cells that were up against that [barrier] ended up in a blind alley."

In contrast, Szycher said the CardioPass graft, which is fabricated from the
company's ChronoFlex biodurable poly (carbonate) urethane, is compliant and
pulsatile as well as microporous to allow tissue in growth and encourage the
formation of a stable neointinal lining, the end stage of the healing process.
"These characteristics make us optimistic that CardioPass will be the first
successful synthetic coronary bypass in the world," he said.

Because the CardioPass better mimics the true conditions within a saphenous
vein, they are able to do two things that more rapidly enable the healing
process.

"No. 1," said Szycher, "is that they start making collagen. All our arteries and
veins are made out of collagen."

Secondly, he said little blood vessels begin to form inside of the CardioPass.
"We have evidence that we form neovascularization," that is a colonization of
new blood vessels that forms a neointinal lining.

He said his past experience working with Thermo Electron - the parent company of
Thermo Cardiosystems, where he worked to develop an artificial heart program -
helped him to make the connection to the methodology of the CardioPass.

He said that if anyone looks at HeartMate, a product now produced by Thoratec
that Szycher worked on, they will notice that all of the blood-contacting
surfaces of that product are made microporous to promote the formation of a
neoinitnal lining.

"When you get a neointinal lining," he said, "what you  find is  over a long
period of time, this is the heart that has the best blood compatibility of them
all because the cells are from the patient themselves."

In theory, Szycher said, these devices should be able to last in a patient for
at least 20 years, but physicians should be able to tell if the devices will
work in a patient within the first six months after implant, hence, the
significance of the aforementioned milestone event.

"If it goes for six months, 90% to 95% of the problems are going to occur. If
you can get past the first six months," he said, "you know this thing is going
to work for at least 20 years."

According to the American Heart Association (Dallas, Texas), more than 350,000
CABG procedures are performed annually in the U.S. Each such operation typically
requires placement of three bypass grafts. CardioTech estimated that, worldwide,
900,000 patients undergo this surgery each year.

Szycher said he believes that the company will have both a CE mark and FDA
approval for the CardioPass within the next three years.

The Johns Hopkins University: Long-Term Survival Rates After Less-Invasive
Repair of Abdominal Aneurysm the Same as with 'Open' Procedure

LENGTH: 830  words


New Delhi, Dec. 19 -- Despite earlier signs that a less-invasive surgery is
safer and better than "open' operations to repair potentially lethal abdominal
aortic aneurysms, a study led by a Johns Hopkins professor shows survival rates
after four years are similar for both procedures.



In an extended follow-up of patients in the OVER (Open Versus Endovascular
Repair) Trial, researchers found that, contrary to expectations, the two
procedures carried about the same long-time survival after four years, even
though survival was higher in the endovascular group at the two-year mark.
Moreover, among elderly patients often considered too weak to undergo
traditional blood vessel repairs, results showed they did not do better with an
operation that avoids fully opening the abdomen.

Instead, the OVER trial showed that the minimally invasive operation did not
result in increased survival in patients 70 years and older, with benefits
confined mainly to those who are younger, according to Julie A. Freischlag,
M.D., director of the Department of Surgery at the Johns Hopkins University
School of Medicine and leader of the national trial.

A report on the study, which followed patients for up to nine years, appeared in
the Nov. 22 issue of The New England Journal of Medicine.

"Overall, the results suggest that the outcomes following endovascular repair
continue to improve and the procedure is now an acceptable alternative to open
repair, even when judged in terms of long-term survival," says Freischlag, a
professor of surgery at Johns Hopkins and a vascular surgeon at the Baltimore VA
Medical Center, one of the sites where the study was conducted. "But this
research raises a new question of whether older patients should even have their
aneurysms repaired, because even when they were fixed, it did not prolong life.
They are dying of the diseases of old age."

Abdominal aortic aneurysms occur when the wall of the body's biggest blood
vessel, at its location in the abdomen, balloons. If an aneurysm ruptures,
severe bleeding is often quickly lethal, so when a dilated vessel over two
inches is discovered, surgeons often try to repair it. Abdominal aortic aneurysm
is the 14th-leading cause of death for the 60- to 85-year-old age group in the
United States.

An open surgery involves a large incision made in the belly to clamp, cut out
the bulge, and replace the weakened part of the aorta with a graft, an operation
that costs about $5,000. Patients are at risk of long hospital stays, pain and
an increased risk of infections, risks associated with most major operations.

With endovascular repair, a tube or stent containing the graft is threaded into
an artery through a small incision near the groin, then pushed up into the
aorta. Once in the right place, the sheath on the tube is pulled back and the
graft pops out to sit inside the aneurysm. The aneurysm isn't cut out, but is
contained in a way that defuses the danger of rupture.

This graft costs about $35,000 and only works on patients with the appropriate
anatomy to fit the graft. Those who have endoscopic repair must be monitored by
CT scans every six months to make sure the graft has not shifted out of place.

For the OVER study, 881 patients ages 49 and older at 42 Veterans Affairs
medical centers were randomly assigned to either endovascular repair or open
repair beginning in 2003, and were followed for up to nine years. The average
age of the patients was 70.

In each group, 146 deaths occurred from all causes. There were 10
aneurysm-related deaths (two within 30 days of surgery and eight later) in the
endovascular repair group, and 16 (13 in the first 30 days and three later) in
the open repair group. Six aneurysm ruptures were confirmed in the endovascular
group; none occurred in the open repair group. The researchers say the ruptures
occurred only in patients who did not have regular, recommended CT scans.

Each year, 40,000 people in the United States undergo elective abdominal aortic
aneurysm repairs. Some 1,250 people die within the first 30 days after surgery -
more than for any other general or vascular surgical procedure, with the
exception of colon removal.

People who have abdominal aortic aneurysms are older, usually men and often
smoke cigarettes. Freischlag says that people under 70 and who are more likely
to follow through with CT scans will benefit from endovascular repair. But it
definitely is not best for the older patients for which it was envisioned to be
a better option, she says.

"If a patient is young enough and healthy enough to have the open repair, it's a
good way to go, because it's cheaper, easier to do and does not require
follow-up CT scans every six months," Freischlag says. "But if patients are
older and in poorer health, repair may not be an option. Costs and benefits must
be carefully weighed for each individual."

The study was supported by the Cooperative Studies Program of the Department of
Veterans Affairs Office of Research and Development.

o Imaging Diagnostic Systems (IDSI; Fort Lauderdale, Florida) said that Schering
AG (Berlin, Germany) has completed the evaluation of its new fluorescence dyes
with three modified CT Laser Mammography (CTLM) systems from IDSI. Imaging
Diagnostic Systems said it believes that fluorescence dyes and other vasoactive
agents may help improve the cancer detection accuracy of laser breast imaging
and that it will continue research in this area. The CTLM system uses laser
technology and algorithms to create 3-D cross-sectional images of the breast.

o Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LabCorp; Burlington, North
Carolina) reported the availability of Roche Diagnostics'Cytochrome AmpliChip
P450 2D6/2C19 Genotyping and Phenotyping Assay as an enhancement to LabCorp's
pharmacogenetics test menu. Cleared by the FDA for diagnostic use, the assay
uses DNA microarray technology to provide a rapid method of identifying multiple
genetic variants in two cytochrome P450 (CYP450) genes, CYP2D6 and CYP2C19.
These genes metabolize 40% to 45% of all prescription drugs, including
antidepressants, pain relievers and cardiovascular agents. Variants in these
genes can cause individuals to metabolize certain medications more slowly or
quickly than normal, which can lead to serious side effects. LabCorp said
identifying these variants can help healthcare providers select optimal drug
doses for their patients and avoid potentially serious drug interactions.

o Medwave (Danvers, Massachusetts), a developer of sensor-based, non-invasive
blood pressure measuring solutions, said it has submitted a 510(k) application
to the FDA for its Primo Non-Invasive Blood Pressure Monitoring System. In
conjunction with researchers and clinicians at Massachusetts General Hospital
(Boston), Medwave has completed clinical validation studies for the Primo
system, testing its performance against that of an invasive arterial catheter.

o Osteotech (Eatontown, New Jersey) said the FDA has cleared its 510(k)
application for Grafton Plus DBM Paste for use as a bone graft extender, bone
graft substitute and bone void filler in orthopedic procedures. Sam Owusu-Akyaw,
president and chief operating officer, said the 510(k) for orthopedic use is the
first of five 510(k) applications the company has filed with the FDA covering
its family of Grafton DBM products. "To our knowledge," he said, "this is the
only DBM product on the market to receive clearance as a bone graft extender,
bone graft substitute and bone void filler." Grafton Plus DBM Paste is a
demineralized bone product that is osteoinductive and has been validated to
inactivate a panel of viruses, including HIV-1, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, CMV
and polio.

o Roche Pharmaceuticals (Nutley, New Jersey) and Trimeris (Morrisville, North
Carolina) said they have received an "approvable" letter from the FDA in
response to their request for inclusion of information about the Biojector 2000
(B2000) needle-free injection device in Fuzeon (enfuvirtide) labeling. In the
letter, the FDA has requested additional information from the ongoing ENF-404 or
WAND (With A Needle-Free Device) study, a randomized, open-label, study
assessing the tolerability of the B2000 device made by Bioject for
administration of Fuzeon, the first fusion inhibitor for the treatment of HIV.
The B2000 is a needle-free, CO2-powered injector that disperses liquid
medication beneath the skin. Fuzeon currently is approved for administration
with a needle and syringe. Roche and Trimeris filed a supplemental new drug
application in May based on data from the T20-405 study, a single-dose
pharmacokinetic study of Fuzeon administered via the B2000 needle-free device,
compared to standard needle-syringe administration. In August, the companies
reported the initiation of the Fuzeon WAND (With A Needle-Free Device, or
ENF-404) study, an eight-week trial designed to assess patient acceptance and
experience of Fuzeon administration via the B2000 needle-free device. The trial
currently is enrolling and final data are expected in the second half of 2006.

MEDTRONIC SEES OPENING
BUT GUIDANT GUILTY PLEA COULD ALSO CHILL HEART-DEVICE MARKET

BYLINE: JIM MCCARTNEY, Pioneer Press

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. E1

LENGTH: 307 words


Guidant's recent decision to stop selling stent grafts might seem like a clear
win for Medtronic Inc., long its only competitor in that market.

But it isn't that simple.

After pleading guilty to 10 felonies for concealing problems related to the
insertion of a subsidiary's aortic stent device and agreeing to pay a $92
million fine, Indianapolis-based Guidant decided to exit the business. Guidant's
aortic stent graft sales last year of $61 million were less than half of
Fridley-based Medtronic's $154 million, according to analyst estimates. The
stent graft business accounted for less than 2 percent of Medtronic's overall
$7.67 billion in sales last year.

"We will pick up some sales," said Medtronic spokeswoman Rachel Scherer as part
of a telephone conference with securities analysts Monday.

But Medtronic's seeming good fortune could be dampened by the harsh attention
the stent graft procedure attracted thanks to the criminal investigation of
Guidant, said Thomas Gunderson, a securities analyst with U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray. Some news accounts questioned the safety and effectiveness of the stent
graft approach when compared with conventional surgery.

"It got a lot of people scared," Gunderson said. "It was a misstep for the whole
market."

In addition, Medtronic faces two new competitors: Cook Inc. and W.L. Gore &
Associates, both of which have "second generation" devices competing with
Medtronic's "first generation" device, Gunderson said. Medtronic expects to have
its more advanced version available later this year, which should be a nice
boost for sales, Scherer said.

"The market is looking more rather than less favorable for us, and it will be
the new device that leads to gains," Scherer said.

FDA approves launch of Titan's Endoskeleton TL device for lateral spinal fusion

SECTION: TREATMENT; Product Launches / Expansions

LENGTH: 455 words



HIGHLIGHT: The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted approval to
Titan Spine to commercially launch its Endoskeleton TL system, a spinal fusion
solution that uses a lateral approach.


The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted approval to Titan Spine to
commercially launch its Endoskeleton TL system, a spinal fusion solution that
uses a lateral approach.

Endoskeleton TL is the first device to feature surface technology that is
designed to participate in the fusion process by creating an osteogenic response
to the implant's topography.

The new device uses the company's roughened titanium surface technology to the
lateral approach.

The titanium surface technology has been shown to upregulate the production of
osteogenic and angiogenic factors that are critical for bone growth and fusion.

The device features large windows and large internal volumes to allow for bone
graft packing, clear CT and MRI imaging, desired bone graft loading, and the
ability to pack additional bone graft material within the device following
implantation.

In July 2014, Salt Lake Orthopaedic Clinic orthopedic spine surgeon Kade
Huntsman has performed the first surgery using the Endoskeleton TL device at St.
Mark's Hospital in Salt Lake City.

Huntsman said for the first time, he was able to insert additional bone graft
material in to a lateral device post-implantation, and the radiopaque nature of
the TL made it extremely easy to place the device in the desired location.

"I am excited to offer the TL, and the benefits of its surface technology and
design features, to my patients requiring lateral interbody fusion," Huntsman
said.

The full line of Endoskeleton devices features the company's implant surface
technology, consisting of a unique combination of roughened topographies at the
macro, micro, and cellular levels.

The company said that the combination of surface topographies is designed to
create an optimal host-bone response and actively participate in the fusion
process by promoting new bone growth, encouraging natural production of bone
morphogenetic proteins (BMP's) and creating the potential for a faster and more
robust fusion.

Titan Spine chief medical officer Paul Slosar said: "The ability to orchestrate
cellular behavior and promote bone growth in response to an interbody device has
not been in the lateral surgeon's armamentarium until now.

"The TL is the byproduct of a unique collaboration between academic biomaterial
scientists, spine surgeons, and industry experts to create a truly
differentiated lateral interbody device that is designed to benefit both
patients and surgeons.

"With the addition of the TL device, Titan Spine now offers its surface
technology and complete line of titanium devices for virtually all interbody
fusion spine surgery procedures in the cervical and lumbar spine."

After FDA's PAS-Port OK, Cardica shares jump by 35%

After FDA's PAS-Port OK, Cardica shares jump by 35%

By OMAR FORD Medical Device Daily Staff Writer

Doing business in med-tech is at once both complicated and simple. As an example
of the latter, a nod from the FDA is all a company needs to make some serious
headway in the market.

Take Cardica (Redwood City, California) for example. Shares for the
California-based company shot up more than 35% at $10.70 a share on the same day
it issued a press release noting 510(k) clearance to market its PAS-Port
Proximal Anastomosis System for use in cardiac bypass surgery in the U.S.

Until now, the system was limited to sales in Europe and Japan, but FDA approval
opens up a floodgate of patients who're looking for a safer, less-intrusive
means of cardiac bypass surgery.

During a Tuesday morning conference call, company executives went into great
detail regarding PAS-Port, but didn't give out a specific price for the device.

"With the introduction of the PAS-Port system in the U.S., cardiothoracic
surgeons are now provided with a complete package of reliable, automated
revascularization systems for use in CABG procedures," President/CEO Bernard
Hausen, MD, PhD, said during the call.

He added, "We believe that by replacing hand-sewn sutures, our automated
proximal and distal anastomoses systems can help cardiovascular surgeons perform
consistent, reliable anastomoses with even the smallest of vessels, giving
surgeons greater ability to use minimally invasive techniques for cardiac
surgery."

Hausen said Cardica plans to launch PAS-Port in the U.S. in the next several
weeks with "a systematic and deliberate roll-out to surgeons and [we] look
forward to training 50 to 60 surgeons per quarter, as we previously have
discussed."

The device creates a secure connection between the body's main artery and vein
grafts. It differs from the current method of connecting a bypass graft vessel
to the aorta in CABG surgery, which often requires that the aorta be clamped and
utilizes time-consuming, hand-sewn sutures. When the clamp is released, tiny
blood clots or particles from the aortic wall can be released, which can travel
to the brain and cause stroke and other neurologic complications.

The company said the PAS-Port system allows a surgeon to complete an automated
proximal anastomosis without the need to clamp and manipulate the aorta.
Eliminating the clamp may greatly reduce the risk of particle release and
ensuing neurocognitive events, it said.

Put another way, this means an attachment to a vessel of 3 mm or more in
diameter, using a clamping or "coupling" approach, compared to connection to a
vessel of just 1 mm in diameter, using the delicate stapling method.

"PAS-Port leaves no metal or aluminum in the graft and it reduces occurrences of
restenosis," Hausen said, calling the device a "major milestone". The system's
design allows surgeons to load the bypass graft into the system and rapidly
complete the anastomosis, typically in about a minute.

This reduces the time required for the anastomosis while providing a consistent,
reliable connection. The bypass graft is loaded into the system without damaging
endothelial cells, while maximizing the orifice, which is especially important
with a small graft. No metal is within the lumen of the graft vessel.

According to results from the pivotal clinical trial of the PAS-Port system,
anastomosis surgical time is significantly reduced compared with hand-sewn
anastomoses. Patient outcomes may be improved due to shortening of surgery times
and hospital stays and reducing complications associated with aortic clamping.

Cardica conducted a 220-patient, prospective, pivotal, randomized trial of
PAS-Port at 12 sites in the U.S. and Europe. The trial compared venous bypass
graft vessel connections to the aorta made using the PAS-Port system versus
those made using conventional hand-sewn sutures. Results showed that the study
met its primary endpoint of non-inferiority to hand-sewn anastomoses, as well as
all other primary and secondary endpoints.

As of June 30, more than 8,800 PAS-Port systems had been sold worldwide, with
the vast majority of units deployed in Japan. According to Cardica's Japanese
distributor, the PAS-Port system is used in more than 20% of all proximal
anastomoses performed using a vein bypass graft during CABG surgeries in Japan.

Cardica expects to have 50 to 60 surgeons trained to use the device per quarter.

The company also said that it can produce an adequate amount of devices based on
patient's needs.

"We can do 3,000 units a month and we have an inventory of PAS-Ports built up,"
CFO Bob Newell said during the conference call. "We'll run (the availability of
the device) off procedures and we wouldn't anticipate big inventory build-ups."

The FDA approval comes as a breath of financial fresh air for the company, which
has projected a loss of from $16 million to $18 million for FY08 (Medical Device
Daily, May 1, 2008).

The small med-tech that could has had support, however. Cardica reported
receiving $2 million in January from Cook Medical (Bloomington, Indiana) and
more recently another $445,000 in milestones for further development efforts
under the Cook Vascular Closure Device and patent foramen ovale license,
development and commercialization agreements -- these agreements providing
potential extension of the company's technology to other cardiovascular
applications.

The company has said in the past that it has a good fiscal foundation: $28
million in cash and a monthly burn of just $2.4 million.

* * * * * * * * * * DESCRIPTION * * * * * * * * * *

   Dextera Surgical Inc., formerly Cardica, Inc., incorporated on October 15,
1997, designs and manufactures stapling devices that enable the advancement of
minimally invasive surgical procedures. The Company is engaged in
commercializing and developing its MicroCutter 5/80 stapler based on its
staple-on-a-strip technology for use by thoracic, pediatric, bariatric,
colorectal and general surgeons. The Company designs, manufactures and markets
automated anastomotic systems used by surgeons to perform anastomoses during on-
or off-pump coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) procedures. Its MicroCutter 5/80
is a commercially available cartridge-based microcutter device with
approximately five millimeter shaft diameter, over 80 degrees of articulation,
and an approximately 30 millimeter staple line cleared for specified indications
for use in the United States, and in the European Union (EU) for a range of
indications for use.

   As of June 30, 2016, the Company marketed three products to perform
anastomoses, such as the C-Port xA system, the C-Port Flex A system and the
PAS-Port Proximal Anastomosis System (PAS-Port system). Its C-Port Distal
Anastomosis Systems (C-Port systems) are sold in the United States and Europe.
It has developed C-Port xA system to use veins and arteries as the bypass graft
vessel. The C-Port xA system is actuated by depressing a trigger, which
activates a manifold powered by a cylinder of compressed carbon dioxide to
provide smooth actuation. Its C-Port xA Distal Anastomosis System is designed to
perform an end-to-side distal anastomosis by attaching the end of a bypass graft
to a coronary artery downstream of an occlusion or narrowing.

   The C-Port Flex A system is designed to further enable minimally invasive
CABG surgery. As of June 30, 2016, it had sold an aggregate of over 15,000 units
of all the versions of its C-Port systems. The PAS-Port system automates the
performance of a proximal anastomosis between a graft vessel, typically a
saphenous vein, and the aorta. The PAS-Port system is marketed in the United
States, Europe and Japan. As of June 30, 2016, over 44,500 PAS-Port systems have
been sold, primarily in Japan and the United States. The Company's planned
microcutter product line includes MicroCutter XCHANGE 45 and MicroCutter
FLEXCHANGE 30. The Company's products minimize trauma to both the graft and
target vessel during loading and deployment.

   The Company competes with Johnson & Johnson, Inc., Medtronic, Inc., JustRight
Surgical, LLC, Stryker Endoscopy, Olympus, Vitalitec and Maquet Cardiovascular
LLC.

Stent Graft Reduces Treatments for Dialysis Patients, Study Finds

LENGTH: 223 words


A new stent graft can keep blood vessels open for longer, reducing the number of
procedures dialysis patients need, a new study has found.

The device reduces the need for repeated invasive procedures and interruption of
dialysis by improving graft function in patients whose access grafts have become
narrowed, according to research from the University of Maryland.

The device allows physicians to mimic the effect of surgery at the scarred area
without actually performing invasive treatment.

This self-expanding metal stent graft creates a scaffold to keep the blood
vessel open and the opened vessel is covered by polytetrafluoroethylene, the
same material from which most dialysis grafts are made.

The new stent reduces the need to interrupt dialysis and is a cost-saving
procedure with improved quality of life for patients who spend about nine to 12
hours a week in dialysis.

The study took place at 13 sites across the US and enrolled nearly 200 patients,
of which 97 patients received angioplasty with the new stent compared to 93 who

Stent Graft Reduces Treatments for Dialysis Patients, Study Finds

LENGTH: 223 words


A new stent graft can keep blood vessels open for longer, reducing the number of
procedures dialysis patients need, a new study has found.

The device reduces the need for repeated invasive procedures and interruption of
dialysis by improving graft function in patients whose access grafts have become
narrowed, according to research from the University of Maryland.

The device allows physicians to mimic the effect of surgery at the scarred area
without actually performing invasive treatment.

This self-expanding metal stent graft creates a scaffold to keep the blood
vessel open and the opened vessel is covered by polytetrafluoroethylene, the
same material from which most dialysis grafts are made.

The new stent reduces the need to interrupt dialysis and is a cost-saving
procedure with improved quality of life for patients who spend about nine to 12
hours a week in dialysis.

The study took place at 13 sites across the US and enrolled nearly 200 patients,
of which 97 patients received angioplasty with the new stent compared to 93 who
received angioplasty alone.

The recurrence of vessel narrowing, restenosis, was nearly three times lower
with the stent group, (27.6 % vs 77.6 %).

This study was published in the New England Journal of Medicine and was funded
by Bard Peripheral Vascular, manufacturer of the Flair Endovascular stent graft.

HIGHLIGHT: Laurie Thompson, National Park Service orchardist, places the first
bridge graft Tuesday morning over a cavity in the Old Apple Tree. --- Laurie
Thompson, orchardist with the National Park Service, works on the trunk of
Vancouver's Old Apple Tree, preparing a graft site. --- Laurie Thompson cuts a
notch Tuesday in Vancouver's Old Apple Tree to do a bridge graft over the cavity
in the trunk. Watching, from left, are Lyle Feilmeier, Susan Dolan, Joe Beaudoin
and John Dale. Top: Thompson places the first bridge graft. ---


Vancouver's gnarled Old Apple Tree is getting a little help from some of its
fresh young sprouts.
Thin shoots taken from the damaged tree about three months ago came back home
when a National Park Service orchardist used them for repair material.


Laurie Thompson went to work Tuesday morning on a bridge-graft project to
assist Vancouver's only living survivor of the
Hudson's Bay Company
era.
The familiar pink of fledgling apple blossoms and light green of delicate new
leaves show that the Old Apple Tree still is healthy, said Charles Ray,
Vancouver's urban forester.
"It's a very healthy tree that has structural problems," Ray said.
Those problems are centered on two gaping cavities in the trunk, at spots where
two of the three main limbs snapped off in June.
That's where Thompson is doing the bridge grafts. Inserted into the trunk below
and above the cavities, the cuttings eventually will become part of the tree
and provide a new network for nutrients traveling from the roots to the upper
branches.
By Tuesday afternoon, Thompson had grafted a half-dozen or so twigs over the
hole on the east side of the tree. The resulting grillwork looked a bit like
bars over a dungeon window.
Volunteers also help
Three local volunteers who are part of the Old Apple Tree's support team also
had a chance to do some work. Joe Beaudoin, an east Vancouver farmer, and
Collier Arbor Care professionals Lyle Feilmeier and John Dale did some grafting
and chain-saw setup work.
The graft material - 18- to 24-inch-long wands called "scion" wood - had been
snipped from the tree in November, when the two damaged limbs were chain-sawed
off. The shoots were refrigerated at the U.S. Department of Agriculture's
national plant germplasm repository in Corvallis, Ore., until the right time
for grafting.
"This time of year, you get movement of fluid upward that causes the bark to
slip," said Susan Dolan, a historical-landscape architect with the Park
Service's regional office in Seattle. "It's important that the scion wood be
dormant, crisp and right out of the refrigerator."
Even with conditions just right, "a third of the grafts will take," Dolan said.
"This will be repeated at this time next year."
Thompson, who oversees a historic Eastern Washington apple orchard near Lake
Chelan, found herself working with a different critter Tuesday morning.
"It's gnarlier, it's 100 years older, it's a lot bigger," Thompson said. "The
diameter of the trunk is three times bigger, and the bark in some places is an
inch wide; I've only worked with quarter-inch bark."
The setting was different, too. The city's Old Apple Tree Park is nestled
between a railroad track and a state highway, with two airports nearby. The
park also serves as the gateway to a popular walking path, so a few pedestrians
came over to see what was going on.
Usually, where she works, Thompson said, "there's nobody around but bears and
Bambis."

Update
* Previously: Vancouver's Old Apple Tree was damaged in June when two of its
three main limbs snapped.
* What's new: A National Park Service orchardist grafted both ends of thin
shoots, which were trimmed from the tree three months ago, as "bridges" over
the damaged areas.
* What's next: The grafts will eventually provide new routes for nutrients.

Radiation helps keep ticker ticking

SOURCE: Linda Johnson

SECTION: News; Pg. A17

LENGTH: 241 words

DATELINE: The Associated Press

A jolt of radiation can help keep the blood vessels of the heart from getting
clogged up with scar tissue after coronary bypass surgery, a study has found.

The still-experimental approach could help solve a problem that crops up for
many of the more than one million North Americans who get bypass surgery or
angioplasty each year.

During bypass, surgeons frequently use a vein taken from the leg to reroute
blood around clogged stretches of heart arteries. However, these grafts are
prone to becoming clogged, and about 40 per cent fill up within 10 years.

To combat this, doctors often perform angioplasty on the graft, squeezing it
open with a tiny balloon and then inserting a metal mesh tube, called a stent,
to keep it open.

However, muscle cells inside the graft sometimes form scar tissue that grows
over the stent, limiting blood flow.

The latest solution consists of an angioplasty plus a dose of radiation,
administered by threading a tiny ribbon containing radioactive seeds through the
graft or stent and leaving it there for 20 minutes to inhibit scar tissue.

Six months later, clogging had occurred in 21 per cent of the radiation patients
compared with 44 per cent of those who got a dummy treatment.

That is a dramatic reduction, said Dr. Jeffrey Popma, director of interventional
cardiology at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.

The results are reported in today's New England Journal of Medicine.

EMERALD trial for GuardWire in AMI patients a flawed gem

EMERALD trial for GuardWire in AMI patients a flawed gem

By HOLLAND JOHNSON Medical Device Daily Associate Managing Editor  NEW ORLEANS,
Louisiana - The hope that distal protection - a method that is designed to guard
against the gunk that is dislodged from a clot during a balloon angioplasty -
will be beneficial in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention
(PCI) for acute heart attack has been dashed, according to a late-breaking trial
presented during the American College of Cardiology (Bethesda, Maryland) meeting
here this week.

Distal protection devices have been shown to be very effective in patients
undergoing saphenous vein graft (SVG) interventions, and several companies'
systems, including Medtronic's (Minneapolis, Minnesota) PercuSurge GuardWire
Plus system and Boston Scientific's (Natick, Massachusetts) FilterWire EX
Embolic Protection system, already are approved in the U.S. for use in saphenous
vein grafts that have become occluded after coronary artery bypass graft
surgery. Such devices are designed to prevent particles that may be dislodged
during a stent or angioplasty procedure from creating blockages of their own,
especially in the small vessels of the brain or lungs.

The FilterWire EX system is the first filter-based system approved for SVG
treatment and contrasts with Medtronic's device, which temporarily occludes the
vessel and uses vacuum pressure to retrieve the particles.

While this SVG patient population is obviously important, it has been widely
believed that the ultimate market for these devices may be expanded
significantly with additional indications for use in carotid artery stenting
(CAS), acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and other peripheral vascular
applications.

To test the potential benefit of these devices in heart attack patients, the
Enhanced Myocardial Efficacy and Recovery by Aspiration of Liberalized Debris
(EMERALD) trial - sponsored by Medtronic - randomized 501 patients within six
hours of the onset of their chest pain to PCI with or without the GuardWire
Plus.

Preliminary data from EMERALD, which began in May 2002, showed that treatment
for AMI with PCI alone to be approximately equal to PCI with GuardWire
mechanical protection, in terms of ST-segment resolution 30 minutes after the
procedure. The rates were 60% and 62% respectively. Additionally, there was no
difference between the populations in MI size at day five or thereafter.

"While we effectively removed embolic debris from most patients undergoing
primary angioplasty, we were unable to show that this made a beneficial impact
on the size of the heart attack or patient outcomes," said lead investigator
Greg Stone, MD, of Lenox Hill Hospital (New York), at a press conference earlier
in the week.

The EMERALD trial marked the first time a distal protection system was evaluated
for use during percutaneous intervention in patients who had experienced AMI. At
the time the trial began in 2002, the company had expressed optimism that the
.028 inch GuardWire Plus system, which is designed with a low profile, would be
small enough to accommodate the small vessel diameters (2 mm to 5 mm) needed to
perform the procedure.

A doctor intimately familiar with the GuardWire device told Medical Device Daily
that the trial probably should never have been carried out, since he did not
believe the device was designed to fit well in the areas of the heart necessary
to perform the procedure. In fact, he said his center refused to take part in
EMERALD because of that belief.

While the device did not work in patients undergoing PCI for acute heart attack,
another embolic protection device, Guidant's (Indianapolis, Indiana) Acculink
Carotid Stent System combined with its over-the-wire Accunet Embolic Protection
System, enjoyed a measure of success in one of the other important peripheral
vascular applications, the treatment of CAS via the ARCHeR trials, reported on
earlier in the week.

An important safety parameter in any stroke prevention trial is the rate of
major stroke and death. At 30 days, the rate of major stroke and death across
ARCHeR 1, 2 and 3 was 3.8%, 2.5% and 2.8%, respectively. From 31 days to one
year, there were no major ipsilateral strokes in ARCHeR 1, and only one in
ARCHeR 2.

According to William Gray, MD, of the Swedish Heart Institute (Seattle,
Washington), a lead researcher of the ARCHeR study, carotid artery stenting
could eventually replace carotid endarterectomy surgical procedures,
particularly in high risk groups. "The results were very good. Carotid stenting
is a new technology which very well could supplant surgery in these high-risk
patients," he said.

Gray said he believes that once carotid stenting has been approved for use in
high-risk patients, it could quickly be adopted as the standard of care.

Scotts Valley firefighter in head-on crash needs skin graft surgery

BYLINE: Shanna McCord, Santa Cruz Sentinel, Calif.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 344 words


Nov. 23--The driver responsible for a head-on collision on Highway 46 near Lost
Hills on Nov. 14 that seriously injured a Scotts Valley firefighter and his
father has been identified as Juan Rodriguez Villa.

Villa, who has been through several surgeries and is still in the hospital
recovering from burns and lacerations from the crash, is facing charges of
driving without a license and passing without sufficient clearance, the
California Highway Patrol said.

Villa was driving a 1993 Honda Accord east on Highway 46 when he tried to pass
other eastbound drivers. Villa couldn't get back in his lane in time to avoid
hitting the westbound Mini Cooper driven by firefighter Christopher Stubendorf,
34, whose father Richard Stubendorf, 61, of Scotts Valley was a passenger.

Villa, 27, is a migrant worker who lives in Coachella, CHP officer Mariska
Bentley said.

Villa's brother, who was a few cars ahead and turned around when he saw the
crash, took Villa from the site and drove him to John F. Kennedy Memorial
Hospital in Indio, about 300 miles away, Bentley said.

Christopher and Richard Stubendorf were taken to Kern Medical Center in
Bakersfield.

Richard Stubendorf has been released from the hospital, while Christopher, who
lives in Paso Robles, requires skin graft surgery for the open fracture on his
lower right leg, according to Scotts Valley Fire Chief Mike McMurry.

Christopher Stubendorf is planning to be transferred to Stanford Hospital

on Wednesday for the skin grafts, McMurry said.

"It's pretty serious," McMurry said. "All things considered, he's upbeat and
optimistic."

The Stubendorfs were heading to Christopher's Paso Robles home after a weekend
of watching races in Riverside County when they were hit.

Deals roundup

Boston Scientific inks pacts with TriVascular for AAA tech

By DON LONG  Medical Device Daily Managing Editor  Tuesday was an up-and-down
day for Boston Scientific (Natick, Massachusetts), first announcing a promising
product development pact with emerging med-tech firm TriVascular (Santa Rosa,
California) and then reporting that Johnson & Johnson (New Brunswick, New
Jersey) has filed a patent infringement suit against it (see Court report, p.
4).

The new partnering effort with TriVascular was described as "a series of
agreements" which include an unnamed investment in the five-year-old but still
early-stage firm, the tacking down of distribution rights for the company's
system for treating abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and an option to purchase
the company at some later date.

TriVascular's technology allows for the treatment of AAA with a totally
percutaneous system and therefore fits nicely with Boston Scientific's
overriding approach to interventional cardiology. The system uses a 12 Fr
catheter and a novel injection system to deliver a graft to an aneurysm site,
thus providing an elegant and direct strategy for a large problem. AAAs are most
simply described as ballooning segments of the aorta that can burst. The result
is to claim an estimated 18,000 lives in the U.S. each year.

President and chief executive officer of TriVascular is Michael Chobotov, PhD,
who told Medical Device Daily that the distribution portion of the Boston
Scientific agreement is extremely important, since the company has been focused
primarily in an R&D mode. "We've been tackling a challenging technical problem .
. . and so we don't have the distribution, sales and marketing infrastructure,"
he said.

He declined to detail the financing and acquisition specifics of the agreements
with Boston Scientific, other than to describe them broadly as "a variety of
different scenarios."

Chobotov is one of five founders of the company, he said - he and two others
offering mainly the engineering expertise, the remaining two offering the
medical knowledge. The result, he said, has been a strong complementary match
for developing the percutaneous approach to AAA repair.

He described the TriVascular device as a "fluid-filled graft structure, and the
way we've separated the functions of the device is a novel approach in this
field. This allows us to achieve some of the [low] profile benefits by not
having to deliver the device all at once." Rather than using the standard system
of manufacturing a device "in one configuration on the benchtop," Chobotov said,
much of the metal ordinary required to prop a graft open is replaced with a
polymer injected into channels within the graft.

Larry Haimovitch, president of Haimovitch Medical Technology Consultants (Mill
Valley, California), who follows the cardiovascular sector for MDD and its
sister publication, Cardiovascular Device Update, praised both the technology
and the resultant partnership emerging from it.

Boston Scientific had "abandoned" previous efforts in this sector of AAA
treatment, he told MDD, leaving the company with "a huge hole in an important
area of medicine."

Besides pointing out that the low-profile architecture of the TriVascular device
provides a strong fit with Boston Scientific's other efforts in interventional
cardiology, he said that the percutaneous approach in this treatment circumvents
a particular "turf battle" in this sector.

AAA procedures have gravitated from open procedures requiring abdominal
incisions to less-invasive approaches. But even the less-invasive approaches and
the devices used "are so large they require a significant incision into the
femoral artery," Haimovitch said. By contrast, with the TriVascular system and
the percutaneous strategy, "you don't need a vascular surgeon for cutdown into
the artery."

For Boston Scientific, the significance is, he said, that "they can bring a
device to market that can go directly to the interventional cardiologists. This
is a device that allows them to get involved in screening and treatment from A
to Z, and they don't have to say to the vascular surgeon, 'Come along and do
this with me.'"

Haimovitch predicted that the pact with TriVascular is likely to be a
centerpiece of Boston Scientific's analyst conference scheduled for Jan. 21.

In announcing the agreements, Paul LaViolette, senior vice president and
president, cardiovascular, for Boston Scientific, said that the company has
"long sought" a therapeutic approach to this problem that would combine graft
strength with a truly interventional modality. "We believe that TriVascular is
the first to have developed a solution that substantially decreases the profile
of the device down to a percutaneous range while also enhancing the durability
of the graft," he said.

TriVascular reports that it completed its first human implant of its device in
August and recently received an FDA go-ahead to begin a U.S. clinical trial. It
projects receiving a CE marking "late" this year. And other applications of the
system await in the wings, according to the company.

In other dealmaking activity:

·Fair, Isaac and Co. (San Rafael, California), a provider of analytics and
decision technology, said it has acquired the medical bill review business of
Spectrum Managed Care, a wholly owned subsidiary of Ward North America Holding
(San Diego, California).

The asset acquisition will significantly expand the volume of Fair, Isaac's
outsourced bill review business driven through its bill review software, the
company said. Fair, Isaac and Ward North America have entered into a 10-year
partnership agreement as part of this transaction. Terms of the asset
acquisition were not disclosed.

"Fair, Isaac is helping insurance carriers and employers in both the private and
public sector significantly lower their workers' compensation claims costs,"
said Sean Downs, vice president of healthcare and insurance solutions at Fair,
Isaac.

Fair, Isaac said it will gain Ward North America as an important new outsourced
bill review client and provide service to more than 300 customers, including a
number of high-profile corporate risk management accounts, as well as state,
county and municipal jurisdictions nationwide.

o nContact (Morrisville, North Carolina) said the FDA has cleared the company's
modifications to its VisiTrax cardiac ablation device, EPi-Sense, now with
embedded sensing capability. This next generation of technology includes sensors
along the ablation device which provide real-time feedback to physicians
conducting cardiac ablation procedures. The EPi-Sense device and its sensing
technology allows electrophysiologists (EPs) to follow epicardial device
positioning and lesion creation in real time by utilizing navigational mapping.

o St. Jude Medical (St. Paul) reported FDA approval of the Merlin.net Patient
Care Network (PCN), a secure, Internet-based remote care system for patients
with implanted medical devices. The newest version of Merlin.net PCN provides
clinicians with additional insight into changes in their patients' heart failure
status through advanced impedance and lead monitoring capabilities, improving
the management of patients at risk of sudden cardiac death or ventricular and
atrial arrhythmias. To assist physicians in accurately diagnosing and managing
patients with heart failure, the new version of Merlin.net PCN enables the
remote transmission of patient data measured from CorVue Thoracic Impedance
Monitoring, a diagnostic feature that tracks and reports changes in impedance
that may reflect changes in heart failure status, monitored by St. Jude Medical
implantable cardioverter defibrillators and cardiac resynchronization therapy
defibrillators. The algorithm assesses impedance changes in multiple vectors of
the heart throughout the day and provides the flexibility to customize
diagnostic reports for each patient.

o Stratatech (Madison, Wisconsin) reported top-line results from its
proof-of-concept clinical trial of StrataGraft, a universal human skin
substitute being developed for the treatment of severe burns. Enrollment of all
20 subjects is now complete and 19 of 20 patients avoided the need for painful
autograft surgery and regrafting at their StrataGraft-treated sites. The one
subject regrafted by day 28, a primary endpoint, also experienced graft failure
at the control autograft site and other non-study sites. Seventeen of the
remaining 19 evaluable subjects progressed to complete wound closure by 3
months, the trial's second primary endpoint; one subject achieved closure after
3 months due to a wound dressing error that temporarily reopened her closed
wound which had been 95% closed at 2 months; and wound healing in another
subject continues to progress slowly but has not yet reached closure.

o W. L. Gore & Associates (Flagstaff, Arizona) has received FDA approval for the
new large diameter 35 mm trunk-ipsilateral leg and 36 mm aortic extender
components, as well as the lower profile 31 mm diameter trunk-ipsilateral leg
and 32 mm aortic extender components of the Gore Excluder AAA Endoprosthesis.
The new components provide physicians with a proven and durable endovascular
option to treat abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). Compatible with an 18 Fr Gore
DrySeal Sheath, the new 35 mm trunk-ipsilateral leg and 36 mm aortic extender
represent some of the lowest profiles for treating infrarenal aortic necks
measuring up to 32 mm in diameter, expanding the overall treatment range to
19-32 mm, the company said. The lower profile 31 mm diameter trunk-ipsilateral
leg and 32 mm aortic extender components allow the trunk-ipsilateral leg
component to be used with an 18 Fr Gore DrySeal Sheath and the 32 mm aortic
extender component to be used with a 17 Fr compatible sheath to treat aortic
necks with an inner diameter of 27-29 mm. The Gore Excluder AAA Endoprosthesis
is an endovascular stent-graft that seals off the aneurysm and creates a new
path for blood flow. The device is inserted through a small incision in the
patient's leg using a catheter-based delivery technique. Once the physician has
positioned the graft in the diseased aorta, the Gore C3 Delivery System uniquely
and intuitively enables repositioning of the stent-graft. The ability to
reposition the device may minimize complications that could occur if the graft
needs to be moved after the initial deployment.

Boston Sci receives warning letter related to AAA stent system trials

Boston Sci receives warning letter related to AAA stent system trials

A Medical Device Daily Staff Report

The bad news just keeps coming for Boston Scientific (Natick, Massachusetts) as
the company received a warning letter from the FDA concerning safety violations,
including failing to promptly report the deaths of five patients enrolled in
clinical trials of a device used to treat abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). The
two U.S. trials included an early stage trial that involved 43 patients and a
mid-stage trial that did not involve the implantation of the device, called a
stent graft.

The device was developed by TriVascular (Santa Rosa, California), a closely held
company acquired by Boston Scientific in April 2005 (Medical Device Daily, April
19, 2005).

Two deaths occurred after Boston Scientific took over the company, according to
the warning letter, issued Aug. 30.

The company failed to investigate the two deaths to determine whether they were
caused by the stent grafts, according to the letter, signed by Timothy
Ulatowski, director of the compliance office of the FDA Center for Devices and
Radiological Health. At least 25 patients have been found to have stent grafts
with cracks placed in them during studies, and the events weren't reported
within the required deadlines, Ulatowski said in the letter.

"Two of these deaths had not been evaluated to determine if there was a
relationship between the deaths and the investigational device or to determine
if they would be considered to be an [adverse event]," the letter said.

Boston Scientific spokesman Paul Donovan told Bloomberg News that the company
"has no evidence indicating any of the deaths were related to the stent-graft
fractures." After the company learned of the cracks in October 2005, it
conducted an investigation and decided to halt further clinical trials using the
device in 2006. The trial for the device began in 2003.

"We take our responsibility for these trials and to these patients very
seriously," Donovan wrote. "We are working with the FDA to resolve this matter."

The FDA also said the company didn't properly notify trial participants of the
increased risks of stent fractures.

Boston Scientific has until late September to respond to the letter and provide
documentation on the two U.S. trials related to the device.

Late Sunday, Morgan Stanley med-tech analyst Glenn Reicin wrote in a research
report that  the warning letter for the discontinued stent program itself isn't
material, but does raise questions about Boston Scientific's ability to get the
FDA to lift an existing corporate warning.

"We should note that the lifting of the corporate warning letter is essential to
Boston Scientific, as the window to launch Taxus Libert%o ahead of Medtronic's
(Minneapolis) Endeavor is narrowing," Reicin said.

The company is facing several other issues, including finding ways to pay off
the massive debt it incurred with its $27.2 billion acquisition last year of
Guidant (Indianapolis). It has since had weaker sales in its coronary stent and
defibrillator businesses, its two largest units

In a bid to reduce debt and more closely target its core businesses, the company
reported its intention to sell its cardiac, vascular surgery and fluid
management business units (Medical Device Daily, Aug. 20/July 26, 2007). The
company also recently disclosed that it was selling the auditory assets of
Advanced Bionics (Valencia, California) while retaining the pain management
assets of that company after a protracted legal struggle with that company's
management (MDD, Aug. 13, 2007).

Thoratec changes label to prevent side effects

LENGTH: 281 words

A Medical Device Daily Staff Report

The FDA reported a recall of Thoratec's (Pleasanton, California) HeartMate II
pump, according to Reuters.

The company is not required to withdraw any product from the market or cease
selling it, but surgeons have been issued with new instructions about how to
implant the device, which is designed to increase blood flow in patients with
heart failure.

The recall is to "fix" the instructions rather than the product, to make sure
that surgeons do not insert it improperly.

Thoratec reported on March 19 that it had initiated a worldwide "medical device
correction notification" in which it reported it had received 29 reports of a
fault in one component of the device, and it issued new instructions for
implanting it.

The HeartMate II is implanted in the abdomen. One connector, known as the inflow
conduit, brings blood from the heart into the pump. An outflow tube, or graft,
carries blood from the pump to the aorta. The component at issue is known as the
bend relief, which slides over the outflow graft to prevent it from kinking and
impeding blood flow.

In a prior version of the pump, the bend relief and outflow graft were attached
to the pump, but in early 2011, Thoratec introduced a new version, in which the
bend relief was made detachable. The new version was designed to make it easier
for surgeons to take air out of the graft.

However, the company received complaints that the bend relief could become
detached from the pump. In five cases additional surgery was needed. There was
one death, though Taylor Harris, senior director of investor relations, said it
was unclear whether the death was related to the bend relief or another issue.

Pa. Health Dept. cites Temple's transplant programs for failing to meet Medicare
rules

BYLINE: By Stacey Burling; Inquirer Staff Writer

SECTION: PHILADELPHIA; P-com News Local; Pg. B10

LENGTH: 669 words


The Pennsylvania Department of Health has cited four of Temple University
Hospital's transplant programs - lung, kidney, heart and liver - for failing to
meet federal rules for participating in Medicare.

In a report posted recently on its website, the state said Temple's lung- and
kidney-transplant programs had lower-than-expected one-year graft survival
rates. The graft is the transplanted organ. Patients may still be alive if they
received another transplanted organ.

The state also said Temple had done too few heart transplants. In a less-serious
violation, the state said Temple's liver-transplant program had failed to keep
some patients informed of their status on the transplant waiting list.

A Health Department spokeswoman said she would "not provide any further comment
regarding any possible pending actions involving Temple." The Centers for
Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) said Temple would have seven months to
respond. During that time, the program can operate normally, said Anne Snyder, a
nurse consultant with CMS's transplant program.

"We're not taking immediate action, but we expect that the programs are
responding to the data immediately," Snyder said. CMS wants to see that the
hospital has "looked critically at all their operations," hired the experts it
needs, and made changes that will improve results.

Temple has not yet filed a plan of correction to the report, which was based on
a site visit in April, according to the state Health Department website.

Rebecca Harmon, director of public relations for Temple University Health
System, said the kidney program had not been flagged for any problems with
patient survival. "Our practice is to complete an in-depth analysis of every
graft failure and make changes, as appropriate - which is what we did during the
period reviewed in the CMS report. . . . As a result, the program continually
achieves improved processes though ongoing performance-improvement activities."

This month, Temple said it would voluntarily inactivate its lung-transplant
program Friday because its primary lung-transplant surgeon was leaving for
another job.

Last August, the state said Temple's lung-transplant program had one-year
patient and graft survival that were lower than expected for patients
transplanted between Jan. 1, 2007, and June 30, 2009. That report was based on
data from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR), a
government-funded database.

The state added that Temple had lower than expected outcomes in two of four
prior SRTR reports: in January 2010 and July 2009.

Last summer, Temple told the state that it had hired new surgeons in 2009 and
made several other improvements to the program.

The new report covered patients transplanted between July 1, 2007, and Dec. 31,
2009.

The expected number of deaths in the lung-transplant program was 14, while the
actual number was 36. Fifteen graft failures were expected and 37 occurred.

In the kidney program, 3.12 graft failures were expected between July 1, 2007,
and Dec. 31, 2009. The actual number was seven, the state report said.

In its most recently posted report on that time period, the SRTR did not
consider the kidney graft failures higher than expected.

CMS's Snyder said her agency may have used a different measure of statistical
significance than SRTR did. She said Temple's kidney-transplant numbers were out
of compliance during two of the last four six-month reporting periods, which
triggers regulatory action.

CMS requires transplant programs to perform 10 transplants of each type per
year. Temple's heart program has averaged five, the state report said. The
hospital said it did four heart and two heart-lung transplants last year.

"Experience matters in these kinds of surgeries," Snyder said. "They're very
complex."

A new chief of cardiothoracic surgery, T. Sloane Guy, will start at Temple next
month and will recruit another transplant surgeon, the hospital said.

Artificial skin;
 real breakthrough: Shark cartilage changing the face of treating burn victims

SOURCE: The Edmonton Journal

BYLINE: Shawn Ohler, Journal Staff Writer

SECTION: City; Pg. B1 / FRONT

LENGTH: 749 words

DATELINE: Edmonton

In the University Hospital lies a badly burned little boy who is healing quickly
because of a groundbreaking type of artificial skin used exclusively in Canada
by Edmonton plastic surgeons.

It is called Integra, and it contains unusual materials that some burn experts
are championing as the future of tissue engineering -- cattle and shark
cartilage.

"The little boy has burns to 65 per cent of his body, and we have put Integra on
his face, his chest and abdomen. His face looks very good -- the Integra's
working well," says Dr. Edward Tredget, a plastic surgeon and head of the
hospital's burn unit.

"For big burns, Integra is as good or better than the best quality skin graft we
can put on."

Tredget, the only Canadian plastic surgeon to routinely use Integra, learned of
its advantages from the doctors who developed it two decades ago in Boston.

It's not widely used by Canadian physicians because it was only recently
approved here, it's "finicky to work with" and very expensive, says Tredget,
pulling an alcohol-soaked flap of the artificial skin from a clear vial.

Integra is the colour and consistency of a latex condom, but, at $1,000 for a
10-cm-by-20 cm piece, it's much more dear.

The American-manufactured product has two layers -- a porous, lattice-like
collagen sheet derived from cow and shark cartilage, and a soft silicone
membrane.

To use Integra on a burn patient, doctors remove the charred tissue and apply
the artificial skin collagen-side down. Two or three weeks later, after blood
vessels and healthy tissue have grown through the latticework, doctors strip the
silicone layer and apply a thin graft of the patient's own skin.

One of Integra's chief advantages, Tredget says, is that the required follow-up
skin graft is only a quarter of the thickness used in traditional grafts. That
means a burn victim's remaining healthy skin isn't "harvested" as often or as
deeply.

"Say you had someone with burns to 80 per cent of his body. Traditionally, you
take the remaining 20 per cent of skin, cover 15 or 20 per cent of the wounds,
then you wait two or three weeks for the donor site to regenerate," he said.

"Meanwhile, the rest of the burn wound is still sitting there, and there's water
loss and bacteria growth. With Integra, you don't damage the donor sites as much
and you can cover the wound immediately."

Integra also heals quickly and produces a superior cosmetic result, Tredget
says, because it's relatively thick and the animal collagen is structurally
similar to healthy dermis, skin's sub-layer.

"A regular skin graft is usually a partial thickness of the wound. When it
heals, the wounds contract," he says, demonstrating the effects by pulling down
the corners of his eyes and yanking up the sides of his mouth.

Tredget, who has no financial interest in Integra and says he endorses it only
because he believes in the product, acknowledges the artificial skin's flaws.

Because it's inert -- not alive -- Integra can cause infection in burn wounds if
it's not carefully monitored. And it still requires the follow-up graft of the
patient's own skin.

University Hospital lab technicians are joining researchers throughout the world
in trying to grow skin cells that will stick and grow on Integra. If they
succeed, it would be a huge breakthrough in cell biology because it would, in
some cases, eliminate the need for traditional skin grafts.

"You would like a one-step procedure, and people are getting close to it,"
Tredget said.

Integra also raises issues for burn patients who might be queasy that animal
material is being used to speed their recovery.

Tredget says the matter doesn't come up as often as one might think. "The thing
is, for the acutely burned patient, you're using Integra for life-saving
issues."

"Most of them are so sick that they're not in a good position to question it,
and they're looking for anything you can bring to help save their life."

THE WORSE THE WOUND, THE BETTER IT IS

Examples of cases where Integra outperforms traditional skin grafts, according
to the artificial skin's American manufacturers:

- In elderly patients where sparing of the donor sites is desirable due to
thinness of the skin, and/or because creating new wounds may cause undue stress
on the patient;

- In infants where the skin is also thin and where there may be limited areas to
harvest graft tissue;

- In any other patient populations where skin-graft wounds would add stress.

Children's transplant failure rate scrutinized

BYLINE: Luis Fabregas

LENGTH: 529 words


An inspection of the kidney transplant program at Children's Hospital of
Pittsburgh found kidneys transplanted there failed at a higher than expected
rate during a six-year period.

Nine of 103 pediatric kidney transplant patients at Children's were placed on a
wait list for repeat transplants because their kidneys failed within a year of
surgery, the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services found during a
required recertification inspection in May.

No patient died after the transplants, which involved live and deceased donors
between Jan. 1, 2004, and Dec. 31, 2009. The inspection report does not specify
the expected one-year kidney graft survival rate, and a Medicare spokeswoman
could not provide the information on Friday.

Children's spokesman Marc Lukasiak confirmed that the hospital's expected
survival rate matched data from the Scientific Registry of Transplant
Recipients, which showed a one-year kidney graft survival rate of 85.7 percent
at Children's, compared with an expected 95.7 percent national survival rate for
kidney transplants between July 2007 and December 2009.

The inspection report's release occurs at a pivotal time for the UPMC-owned
hospital because its living-donor kidney transplant program has temporarily
closed.

The inspection, conducted under contract by the Pennsylvania Department of
Health, showed several administrative deficiencies with documentation in the
hospital's lung and liver transplant programs. For example, Children's failed to
document that it gave a patient a psychosocial evaluation before an intestinal
transplant.

Children's officials said they established an agreement with the Medicare agency
to improve outcomes in the kidney transplant program. Although one-year graft
survival rates dipped three times during the reviewed time frame, no
transplanted kidney has failed since July 1, 2009, Lukasiak said.

"Our goal is to continue to take care of kidney patients with extremely complex
medical histories while achieving graft and patient survival rates that exceed
national averages," Lukasiak said.

The hospital's patient survival rate, an important performance marker, was 97.7
percent during the review period. That rate, comparable to the national average,
met Medicare requirements, Lukasiak said.

The one-year survival of a transplanted kidney is a good marker of outcomes,
said Dr. Connie Davis, medical director of kidney-pancreas transplantation at
the University of Washington in Seattle.

"Patients who do well out to one year have a higher likelihood of doing well
longer-term," Davis said.

The shutdown in early May of the live-donor kidney transplant program at
Children's resulted from the unexpected closing of UPMC's adult live-donor
kidney and liver transplant programs, after a kidney donor passed the hepatitis
C virus on to a recipient.

Pediatric patients typically receive organs from adult donors, which prompted
Children's to act on UPMC's decision. Children's is expected to lift its
suspension once UPMC's programs reopen.

Children's and UPMC officials cannot say when that might happen, but expressed
confidence they will get clearance from the United Network for Organ Sharing.

AIDS kills three who received infected organs

BYLINE: AP-Reuter

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A15

LENGTH: 575 words

DATELINE: RICHMOND, Va.


   RICHMOND, Va. (AP-Reuter) - More than 50 transplant patients in the United
States received organs or tissues from an AIDS-infected donor six years ago and
three have died of AIDS, health officials said yesterday.

And an elderly Colorado woman who received a hip joint has tested positive for
the virus, said Doug Wilson, a spokesperson for LifeNet Transplantation Services
of Virginia Beach, which supplied the tissues to 30 hospitals around the
country.

The U.S. government is tracking down the transplanted organs and tissues taken
from a dead Virginia Beach man, who died from a gunshot wound during a robbery,
officials said.

Four or five organs, 52 tissue grafts and two corneas were taken from the
22-year-old man in October, 1985, and later transplanted into others, they said.

Although tests by two different laboratories determined he was free of infection
by HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, recipients of three of the transplanted
organs later died after developing AIDS symptoms.

A fourth organ recipient died of complications during transplant surgery and the
Colorado woman has AIDS, but is still alive, officials said.

"It seems likely, by initial investigation, that the donor was in the window
between infection and the ability to detect it," said Bill Anderson of LifeNet.

The case is the first in which a large number of recipients of human tissue
transplants have been placed at risk of AIDS by a single donor.

It is the third in the United States in which recipients of transplanted organs
are known to have become infected with the AIDS virus, officials said.

AIDS - acquired immune deficiency syndrome - strips the body of its defences
against disease. There is no known cure.

The search for recipients is being co-ordinated by the Atlanta-based Centres for
Disease Control and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in Washington.

It began after LifeNet contacted the government seeking help on May 8.

Government officials said the man's heart, kidneys, liver and pancreas were
removed at the Medical College of Virginia at Richmond.

Four of the organs were immediately transplanted into four different people,
although the fate of the pancreas is unknown, they said.

LifeNet officials, however, said they believed the pancreas was discarded and
never transplanted.

The recipients of the heart and kidneys developed AIDS infection and eventually
died, while the recipient of the liver died of complications during surgery.

LifeNet said 45 of the tissue grafts, most of them bone grafts, were
freeze-dried and processed with alcohol or radiation, making it unlikely they
were able to transmit the AIDS virus.

Another four tissue grafts, including the one apparently transplanted in the
Colorado resident, were simply frozen before transplanting, leaving them
potentially capable of transmitting AIDS.

The four remaining tissue grafts consisted of soft tissue that was dried and
frozen prior to transplantation, and it is not known whether these grafts can
transmit AIDS, LifeNet said.

As for the corneas, it is unlikely the AIDS virus would be transmitted by them
because they contain no blood vessels, officials said.

"At present there is no evidence to suggest that any improper procedures were
followed in the recovery or distribution of the donor's tissues and organs," a
U.S. Food and Drug Administration statement said.United; States; transplant;

Cook granted an IDE for thoracic endovascular graft

By HOLLAND JOHNSON  Medical Device Daily Senior Staff Writer  The FDA has
granted Cook (Bloomington, Indiana) an investigational device exemption for a
pivotal clinical investigation of its endovascular graft for thoracic aortic
aneurysms (TAA).

The company received conditional approval to begin a clinical trial of its
Zenith TX2 Thoracic TAA Endovascular Graft involving 140 subjects at 20 U.S.
medical institutions, and patient enrollment will begin soon, company officials
said. A larger study may be permitted following FDA approval of modifications to
the company's proposed clinical protocol.

"Coronary stents have been among the most dramatically successful medical device
innovations in the last decade, and we believe the opportunity for vascular
grafts is at least as exciting," Kem Hawkins, president and chief executive
officer, said in a statement. "Cook's leadership in vascular stents and other
technologies to treat vascular disease in the peripheral arteries further
enhances our position as a pioneer in innovative medical solutions for patients
worldwide. We look forward to the successful completion of our clinical trial
and the U.S. launch of this companion product line to our market-leading Zenith
AAA [abdominal aortic aneurysm] Endovascular Graft system."

Neal Fearnot, PhD, president of Cook's Med Institute subsidiary told Medical
Device Daily that abdominal aortic aneurysms "refer to the aorta below the renal
arteries." Above the renal arteries, he noted, is the diaphragm, which serves as
the demarcation between the abdomen and the thorax. "The section of the aorta
that starts at the heart and goes from the heart down to the diaphragm is known
as the thoracic aorta. The graft in this study addresses aneurysms that fall
above the diaphragm in the thoracic aorta."

The Zenith TX2 Thoracic TAA Endovascular Graft, which already is approved for
commercial distribution in Australia and Asia, incorporates clinically-proven
technologies to treat life-threatening thoracic aortic aneurysms.

Patients diagnosed with TAA traditionally have had to undergo a highly invasive
open surgical procedure during which a vascular surgeon clamps off the aorta and
sews a surgical graft in place to prevent the aneurysm from rupturing. Such open
surgical procedures carry significant health risks for many older patients who
may suffer from other significant medical conditions such as diabetes or
hypertension.

According to the company, clinical experience outside the U.S. suggests that the
Zenith TX2 Thoracic TAA Endovascular Graft system permits treatment of these
aneurysms without the need for major open surgery.

Fearnot said of the TAA graft and the recently approved Zenith AAA product:
"They are similar in some ways and different in other ways." He noted that the
attachment processes are different because the vessel locations are different
for the two types of aneurysms. "I would say it's generally the same technology
applied to the specific application of thoracic aneurysms."

The deployment of the graft is similar to that of the AAA, with one noteable
exception. TAA patients treated with the Zenith require just one incision in the
groin to allow the insertion of the graft's advanced delivery system into the
femoral artery, whereas during a AAA procedure, incisions are required in both
the femoral arteries.

Once the catheter is guided into position through the patient's arteries under
fluoroscopy, a fabric-covered, self-expanding stent-graft is secured inside the
weakened section of the thoracic aorta to relieve pressure on the aneurysm,
greatly reducing the risk of rupture.

Patients treated with minimally invasive endovascular devices such as the Zenith
aortic graft typically experience less trauma and enjoy a much shorter recovery
period compared to patients undergoing open surgical procedures.

Fearnot said the company ultimately expects to have 35 sites for the study, and
in the range of "hundreds" of patients.

While he declined to give specific pricing for the graft, he did say that the he
believes that the price should be similar to the company's AAA device, "given
that the technology and amount of work [to get an approval] is similar." And,
while there are fewer patients today treated for TAAs than AAAs, he pointed out
that this is "obviously still a good market opportunity."

· Cook (Bloomington, Indiana) said it has been granted FDA clearance to sell its
Zenith AAA Endovascular Graft System to physicians. U.S. sales of the
third-generation stent-graft system for the endovascular treatment of abdominal
aortic aneurysm (AAA) will begin immediately, the company said. Features of the
Zenith AAA system include suprarenal fixation and a graft design that allows
treatment of a wide variety of patient anatomies. The system treats AAA without
the need for major surgery. Patients treated with the system require just two
incisions to allow the insertion of two catheters into the femoral arteries in
the groin. Once the catheters are guided into position through the patient's
arteries, a fabric-covered, self-expanding metal stent-graft is deployed inside
the weakened section of the aorta and the surrounding vessels to relieve
pressure on the aneurysm.

· Altea Therapeutics (Tucker, Georgia) said it has begun Phase I clinical trials
in the U.S. for AT1391, the company's daily insulin skin patch designed to
provide continuous basal levels of insulin for patients with diabetes. AT1391
incorporates Altea's PassPort system, developed to deliver protein and peptide
drugs, small-molecule drugs, genes and vaccines across the skin for local and
systemic effect. The company's Phase I clinical trial is a
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study designed to determine the optimal product
characteristics for AT1391 that will meet the basal insulin requirements of
patients with diabetes.

· Biotronik (Lake Oswego, Oregon) reported the first five nationwide implants of
the Cardiac Airbag ICD System. This new device is designed to address the
medical community's demand for affordable patient care by combining targeted
therapy with a cost-saving e-commerce business model. The Cardiac Airbag was
commercially released earlier this month during the annual meeting of the North
American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology in Washington, after receiving
approval from the FDA. At 39 cc and 73 grams, the device delivers up to 30
joules of energy and incorporates the latest technologies. The system requires
only 10 parameters to be programmed during implantation and follow-up
procedures. In addition to providing 24-hour support, Biotronik also is offering
comprehensive training to allow each medical center to independently care for
Cardiac Airbag recipients. The Cardiac Airbag ICD provides essential lifesaving
features for patients at risk of sudden cardiac death, including a programmable
therapy zone that provides shock therapy for the critical treatment of
ventricular fibrillation. A dedicated monitoring zone also is available to
record ventricular tachycardias with a full 30 minutes of two-channel
electrograms. The Cardiac Airbag features the company's Automatic Sensitivity
Control, a beat-to-beat sensing algorithm.Rate-adaptive pacing and post-shock,
high-output pacing are also standard in the Cardiac Airbag ICD.

· Fluke Biomedical (Everett, Washington) introduced the new multi-parameter
patient simulator, MPS450, a complete redesign of the Bio-Tek Lionheart 3
product. The MPS450 has many new features and functions, including a menu-driven
interface that provides an intuitive method of navigating through the multitude
of tests and functions, an extra port for future expansion into the next logical
test parameter, 43 arrhythmias for improved testing of today's advanced
arrhythmia detection systems, a greater range of amplitudes and rates and a
larger display. The company said the MPS450 retains the best features of the
Lionheart 3, including full parameter simulations (ECG, arrhythmia, respiration,
invasive blood pressure, temperature and cardiac output) and adds fetal
simulations and a platform for future simulation enhancements. It is the first
true Fluke Biomedical product, combining the best technologies from its former
brands, Bio-Tek Instruments and DNI Nevada.

· Proxima Therapeutics (Alpharetta, Georgia) said it has received marketing
clearance from the FDA for a new, larger-sized MammoSite balloon catheter.
MammoSite, an internal radiation therapy delivery system for breast cancer, now
will include the option of a spherical balloon catheter capable of expanding 5
cm to 6 cm in diameter. The larger balloon catheter will enable women with
larger tumor cavities to be eligible for this treatment, the company said. Since
its FDA clearance one year ago, MammoSite has helped make breast conservation
therapy - a less invasive course of treatment than mastectomy - an option for
more women with breast cancer, according to Proxima. The MammoSite device is a
balloon catheter inserted into the cavity created by surgical removal of the
breast tumor. During a five-day course of therapy, a tiny radioactive seed
attached to a wire is inserted into the balloon, delivering prescribed levels of
radiation under precise computer control to the targeted tissue surrounding the
cavity. No source of radiation remains in the patient's body between treatments
or after the final procedure.

· Tomen America (New York) and Nippon Kayaku (Tokyo) reported submission of a

·BEI Medical Systems (Teterboro, New Jersey) said the FDA approved a premarket
approval application supplement permitting modifications to the assembly of the
sheath used in the Hydro ThermAblator (HTA) procedure set. This approval allows
BEI to incorporate streamlined manufacturing practices, while maintaining its
high level of product quality and consistency. In the Phase III trial, treatment
using the HTA completely eliminated uterine bleeding in 40% of the patients
whose condition was reviewed 12 months following treatment, while an additional
42% exhibited a decrease in uterine bleeding to normal levels or less as defined
by the FDA. HTA treatment resulted in an overall average reduction in uterine
bleeding of 84.8%. In addition, at 24 months following treatment, 95.5% of
patients were satisfied with the results of their HTA treatment and 92.5% of
patients reported alleviation of menstrual discomfort.

·Biosite (San Diego, California) said the FDA granted 510(k) clearance to market
its Triage TOX Drug Screen, a qualitative test that enables hospital physicians
to quickly and conveniently perform toxicology screening for eight classes of
commonly abused drugs in urine in approximately 15 minutes. Featuring
proprietary biochemical engineering and antibody technology, the Triage TOX Drug
Screen is performed by placing approximately six drops of urine on a small
protein chip that contains a network of micro capillary structures. The
structures control the flow of fluid throughout the protein chip, directing the
sample down a central channel through immobilized antibody zones used for the
detection of specific substances.

·Ethicon Products (Somerville, New Jersey) said new FDA-approved labeling points
to Dermabond Topical Skin Adhesive (2-octyl cyanoacrylate) as a barrier against
bacterial microbes. The microbial barrier provided by Dermabond seals out the
most common infection-causing bacteria. In in vitro studies, Dermabond was 99%
effective in protecting against S. epidermidis, E. coli, S. aureus, P aeruginosa
and Enterococcus faecium. Dermabond is a liquid topical skin adhesive that can
be used to close surgical incisions and traumatic lacerations without stitches
or staples. When closing a wound, the physician first cleans the laceration or
incision, then holds its edges together and applies the adhesive to the skin
using a light, brushing stroke, repeating this three times. Dermabond is
licensed by Ethicon from Closure Medical (Raleigh, North Carolina).

·Guidant (Indianapolis, Indiana) received CE mark approval for the Ancure
Aortoiliac Endograft System, which provides a less-invasive option for patients
previously ineligible for treatment with Guidant's currently available
endovascular graft system due to advanced vascular disease in the iliac
arteries. Developed for the treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysm, Ancure is a
polyester graft or tube attached to the aorta with tiny metal hooks. Inserted
through an incision in the groin and is positioned in the aorta, it extends into
the iliac artery of the patient's pelvis. To complete the procedure, a separate
small graft is put in place to send blood from the healthier femoral artery to
the more diseased artery in the other, blocked leg. Once in place, the graft
reinforces the walls of the aorta, often shrinking the bulge and preventing the
aneurysm from bursting.

·Irvine Biomedical (Irvine, California) received CE mark approval for the
Luma-Cath line of steerable and fixed lumen catheters. Luma-Cath catheters
enable clinicians to diagnose cardiac arrhythmias electrically and inject
contrast medium at the same time, which may lead to a breakthrough in the
diagnosis of some forms of cardiac rhythm disorders. Privately held Irvine
Biomedical develops electrophysiology products for the minimally invasive
diagnosis and treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, including products to diagnose
and treat supra-ventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter.

·Meridian Medical Technologies (Columbia, Maryland) introduced its TelePulse
oximeter, which allows the transmission of the blood oxygen levels of heart
patients to medical personnel by telephone. Continuous readings are
automatically transmitted over telephone lines to a hospital or monitoring
center, where the results can be interpreted by medical professionals. The
device is now available in Europe and Israel, and the company also plans to seek
clearance to market the innovative product in the U.S. The TelePulse oximeter is
manufactured by Meridian and marketed by SHL Telemedicine Ltd., based in Israel.
SHL has formed a joint venture with Philips Medical Systems, which is now
establishing telemedicine centers throughout Europe. Meridian has core
technologies in noninvasive cardiopulmonary diagnostics and develops
auto-injector drug delivery systems.

·Smith & Nephew's Endoscopy Division (Andover, Massachusetts) introduced the
Dyonics Vision 111 Portable Endoscopy System, a mobile, integrated endoscopic
visualization system consisting of a camera, light source and liquid-crystal
display flat-panel monitor. Smith & Nephew is a leader in arthroscopy
(endoscopic procedures performed on articulating joints).

·Trinity Biotech plc (Dublin, Ireland) received FDA marketing clearance for its
Uni-Gold Strep A One-Step-Test. The test is intended as an aid to the diagnosis
of Group A streptococcus, commonly referred to as Strep A, and is responsible
for infections of the throat known as streptococcal pharyngitis. While
streptococcal pharyngitis can be treated effectively with antibiotics, however
clinical findings alone do not adequately distinguish strep and non-strep
pharyngitis. Uni-Gold Strep A provides a result in five minutes, thus allowing
for prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment.

Oklahoma City Thunder: What exactly is going on with Kevin Durant's foot?

BYLINE: By Anthony Slater

SECTION:

LENGTH: 665 words


On Friday afternoon, the Thunder officially ruled Kevin Durant out for the
remainder of the season. After a variety of setbacks the past couple months, it
didn't come as surprising news. But the additional details surrounding the
announcement were worrisome.For the third time in less than six months, Durant
will have surgery on his bothersome right foot. The latest is a bone graft
procedure scheduled for early next week in New York.

It comes with a 4-to-6 month recovery timetable - easily the longest of the
three surgeries - and sets his projected return to basketball activity between
late July and late September, right at the heels of training camp.This latest
step was decided upon after week-long consultation between three of the
country's premier foot and ankle specialists - Dr. Martin O'Malley in New York
City, Dr. James Nunley at Duke University and Dr. Robert Anderson in Charlotte,
who performed the first two surgeries.After the Jones fracture was discovered in
his right foot during training camp, Durant had the original surgery, which
knocked him out six weeks, and a screw inserted to help with the healing. The
second surgery, performed in late February, was to replace that screw, which was
irritating the foot by rubbing against his bone and causing continued
soreness.Just last week, with the soreness remaining an issue even through minor
workouts, Durant's latest comeback attempt was shut down and the specialists
were consulted."While the majority of the soreness in Kevin's foot was related
to continued inflammation of the cuboid bone and would subside with rest,"
Thunder general manager Sam Presti said in a press release Friday afternoon,
"the evaluation process also determined that the Jones fracture of the fifth
metatarsal, which had shown significant healing previously, was now
demonstrating signs of regression."Jones fracture surgeries have a success rate
of between 92 percent to 95 percent. "It's a little unusual that this didn't
heal," Dr. Steven B. Weinfeld, a foot and ankle specialist from the Icahn School
of Medicine at Mount Sinai, said. "Once you put the screw in, these usually heal
reliably."But Durant is now an unfortunate member of that minority group."The
bone graft is the standard procedure for the 5e to 8 percent of Jones fracture
surgeries that do not initially have success or experience setbacks sometime
within the recovery period," Presti said. "While everyone is disappointed that
Kevin falls into that group, we are encouraged that the bone graft procedure has
historically demonstrated long-term health and stability."Nets center Brook
Lopez suffered a Jones fracture in December 2011. That offseason, similar to
Durant, Lopez had the screw in his foot replaced. He returned the next season
and played 74 games.But in January 2014, Lopez had a recurrence of that Jones
fracture and an additional surgery. The procedure, which included some bone
grafting, was done by O'Malley and Nunley, two of the three who were consulted
on Durant's case. O'Malley will perform Durant's surgery early next
week."Basically the idea is to bring bone-healing cells to the area that's not
healing," Weinfeld said of a bone graft procedure. "There are lots of different
ways to do the graft, but what they're trying to do is get the body to restart
the healing process. Because after six months of that, which is about what it's
been, the body stops trying to heal."The team remains optimistic that this
latest surgery will alleviate the problem for good. Bone grafting comes with a
longer return timetable, but has an extremely high success rate."That (4-to-6
month) timeline sounds about right," Weinfeld said. "If this bone graft
procedure works, it's going to take two to three months to know that. Then once
you know it's healed, you can let him go a little harder. I wouldn't think he'd
be able to start heavy running for three months. Then you need at least a month
to get back in shape. So I think that ballpark is about right."

Current orthopedic strategies complemented by gene therapy

LENGTH: 897 words


American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons MeetingCurrent orthopedic strategies
complemented by gene therapy By TRISTA MORRISON Medical Device Daily Staff
Writer SAN DIEGO -- As the 74th Annual Meeting of the American Academy of
Orthopaedic Surgeons (Rosemont, Illinois) convened here yesterday morning, even
the famed Southern California sun and stunning ocean views couldn't draw
attendees away from the panels. Topics such as "orthopedic war injuries" and
"international perspectives on rotator cuff disease" drew standing room-only
crowds as conference-goers packed the convention center.

One topic addressed at the AAOS conference, as well as at recent medical
meetings such as the Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics conference, is
gene therapy.

Regis O'Keefe, MD, PhD, professor of orthopedics with the University of
Rochester Medical Center (Rochester, New York), billed gene therapy as a "hot
topic across all areas of medicine."

Since the high-profile death of young patient Jesse Gelsinger in 1999, which
resulted in a halt of gene therapy trials (MDD, Jan. 23, 2003) and the resultant
flurry of negative media coverage, the field has been steadily -- and much more
quietly -- moving forward.

Clinical trials are ongoing for indications such as cancer, and orthopedic
surgeons are becoming increasingly interested in the potential of this strategy
for applications targeting arthritis, osteoporosis, orthopedic tumors and tissue
repair.

In fact, orthopedics may be the field to "get gene therapy out into the public,"
according to Steven Goldstein, PhD, a professor of orthopedic surgery at the
University of Michigan Medical School (Ann Arbor).

His rationale: that orthopedics would seem to require a more transient delivery
of gene therapy, such as stimulation of protein production just long enough to
repair a bone, rather than the permanent alterations required in the treatment
of other diseases and genetic disorders.

The specific strategies required for delivery is a core issue in gene therapy,
with researchers trying to capture the efficacy of viral vectors, as well as the
safety and cost-effectiveness of non-viral approaches. Goldstein pointed to
studies that have used direct injection of the gene of interest into a wound and
emphasized the promise of "direct matrix" delivery, an off-shoot of this
approach that involves coating the genes onto a three-dimensional surface which
is then implanted into the injury site.

In the case of bone repair, Goldstein told Medical Device Daily, the 3-D surface
could be a bone graft, a collagen sponge, a metal implant or a bioresorbable
implant.

The advantage of this approach in healing musculoskeletal injuries would be the
ability to help bone "come back to life," O'Keefe said. He pointed to the fact
that bone grafts used following the removal of osteosarcomas are "dead" bone,
thus not capable of establishing vasculature. And so the microfractures that
occur due to everyday life worsen until the bone fractures, which can cause
failure of the graft and result in amputation.

In a study published in Nature Medicine (11 (3): 291-7, 2005), O'Keefe and his
team coated a section of murine bone with recombinant viral vectors,
encapsulating the genes that encode for RANK ligand and VEGF. When the coated
bones were re-implanted into mice, the surrounding bone took up and expressed
the proteins, resulting in bone repair.

He said that his group is currently in discussions with the FDA, with the hope
of initiating a clinical trial of the technique in the next year or two.

Goldstein said he could see this application of gene therapy being used in
combination with -- and also potentially as a "next-generation" alternative to
-- current treatments, such as recombinant bone morphogenetic protein (rhBMP-2).
The Infuse Bone Graft product from Medtronic (Minneapolis) contains rhBMP-2 to
stimulate bone regeneration.

For the second fiscal quarter, ended Oct. 27, 2006, Medtronic reported 36%
revenue growth for the Infuse Bone Graft, which is approved for use in spinal
surgery and which an FDA advisory panel recommended for approval in oral
maxillofacial procedures in November 2006.

Recombinant proteins, such as rhBMP-2, are limited by their rapid degradation
inside the body. Gene therapy could potentially offer the ability to secrete
proteins of interest over a much longer period of time.

Goldstein predicted that clinical trials using gene therapy in orthopedic
settings will become more common "within five years." He noted recent advances
in other indications, such as cancer, cardiac ischemia, Parkinson's disease and
sickle-cell disease.

In the orthopedic space, Targeted Genetics (Seattle) is conducting a Phase I/II
trial of tgAAC94, a tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitor delivered via a viral
vector to treat inflammatory arthritis.

Earlier this week, the company reported interim data indicating the approach is
well-tolerated and demonstrating a reduction of tenderness and swelling of the
injected joint following injection.

SPECIAL ANTIBODIES HALT BOY'S REACTION TO HIS TRANSFUSION

BYLINE: By HAROLD M. SCHMECK Jr.

SECTION: Section A; Page 12, Column 1; National Desk

LENGTH: 255 words


Doctors in Boston have used special antibodies to halt a potentially fatal
reaction to a blood transfusion in a baby born with a severe immunological
deficiency. Dr. Fred S. Rosen of Children's Hospital Medical Centersaid the baby
would almost certainly have died without the treatment.

The week-old boy had been given the blood transfusion while undergoing surgery
for a heart defect. Afterward, the medical team discovered that he was born
without a properly functioning thymus, a gland that is vital to the development
of immune defenses.

The baby thus was defenseless against an attack by white blood cells in the
transfused blood. These immunologically active cells recognized the baby's
tissues as foreign and attacked them in what is known as a graft-versus-host
reaction, which is often fatal, Dr.  Rosen said. In a person with a normal
immune system, the body's defenses would have quickly neutralized the foreign
white blood cells.

The baby was given the antibody treatment 48 hours after the reaction began, and
that halted the attack, Dr. Rosen said.  The antibodies, called monoclonal
antibodies, were developed by a Harvard research group to prevent graft
-versus-host reaction in patients who receive bone marrow transplants. They are
designed to attack immunologically active white blood cells, which are the main
cause of graft-versus-host attacks.

The antibodies have been used successfully to prevent graft-versushost attacks,
but never before to counter an attack already in progress, Dr. Rosen said.

Overtime Magic

BYLINE:  By Steve Overbey  STLhighschoolsports.com

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. B7

LENGTH: 600 words


WILDWOOD - All Villa Duchesne freshman field hockey standout Molly Christopher
needed was approval from her coach.

It came in the form of a simple nod.

Given the go-ahead, Christopher converted on a stoke/penalty shot in sudden
death overtime on Monday to lead the Saints to a 2-1 win over Lafayette in a
battle of area heavyweights in Wildwood.

Villa Duchesne remained unbeaten (9-0-1), but by the thinnest of margins.

Christopher blasted her shot from 7-yards out into the upper left-hand corner of
the net.

"I kind of like to watch the goalie," Christopher said. "Then make my move."

Villa Duchesne coach Kate Graft had no reservations about choosing a freshman
for one of the biggest shots of the season.

Lafayette junior keeper Bri Ohlms, who was outstanding throughout the contest,
smothered the ball in the crease late in the 10-minute overtime session,
necessitating the stoke, which is the equivalent of a penalty shot in soccer
except from a closer distance.

After the call was made, several of the Villa Duchesne players looked over to
Graft on the bench with pleading looks in their eyes.

Graft made immediate eye contact with Christopher and gave her a nod.

"She's our best stroker and I had all the confidence in her," Graft said. "We've
got other people that are pretty good at them, but (Christoper) has made them
before. I was pretty sure she would come through."

Christopher made no mistake pounding home her fourth goal of the season to keep
the Saints perfect against area competition. The lone tie came against Trinity
Valley, from Fort Worth, Texas in the Gateway Classic on Sept. 3.

The Saints had their hands full in Monday's showdown. Villa Duchesne junior
keeper Emma Deines and Ohlms recorded one fine save after another. The dueling
keepers spent all of regulation trying to outdo each other.

"Pretty even game overall," Lafayette coach Melissa Lantz said. "Both teams
fought hard."

Lafayette (8-3) controlled play throughout much of the second half and finally
tied the match with 7 minutes and 4 seconds left in regulation. Meghan Conroy
deflected in a shot from up top by Paige Miller.

Deines, while protecting a 1-0 lead, stonewalled Conroy, Mary Reynolds and
Katherine Goddin earlier in the half.

"She's a rock, she's the base of our team," Christopher said of Deines, who has
allowed just four goals in 570 minutes this season.

Deines believes it was one of the Saints' best performances this season.

"I definitely feel like we improved on some of the smaller details of the game,"
Deines said. "From a defensive point of view, our marking tonight was a lot
better than it has been in previous games."

Mary Grace Cusumano and Jessica Moellering created numerous chances for the
Saints, but Ohlms was equal to the task.

Villa Duchesne took a 1-0 lead on a goal by Maria Fitzmire just over three
minutes into the match. Fitzmire unloaded a high shot that bounced and took an
in-between hop past Olms.

The Saints woke up in the extra session and forced four corners before
Christopher's goal, which came with 3:39 left in the 10-minute OT.

The win not only keeps Villa Duchesne undefeated, but it delighted Graft, who
graduated from Lafayette and also coached there.

"It was a special win and it's nice to be back here," Graft said.

The Saints, who have outscored their opponents 36-5 this season, are among the
front-runners for the wide open area championship. Three-time defending
title-holder MICDS (7-2) is not as dominating as in the past.

Both Villa Duchesne and St. Joseph's (10-0-1) are without a loss.

"When we get going and generate a lot of attack, we're tough to beat,"
Christopher said.

DIGGING DEEP TO PROTECT HEALTHY OAK TREES FROM INFECTED ONES

BYLINE: Sandy Feather

SECTION: LIFESTYLE; Q&A WITH SANDY FEATHER; Pg. D-9

LENGTH: 730 words


Q.: My neighbor has lost several red oaks to oak wilt. I have three red oaks
that really make my back yard. I would hate to lose them. What should I do to
protect my seemingly healthy trees?

A.: It is wise to contract with a certified arborist for an accurate diagnosis
of oak wilt and the safe removal of dead trees. An arborist can also recommend
fungicide injections that can protect healthy trees growing near infected ones.

Fungicides such as Alamo (propiconazole) injected every two years have been
shown to be effective. Even trees that have begun to show symptoms can be
successfully treated with Alamo if less than 30 percent of the crown is
affected.

Because Alamo does not kill the fungus present in an infected tree's roots, such
trees should be treated every year. These products are not available to home
gardeners. Check the Yellow Pages to find a certified arborist in your area.

Trees of related species growing in proximity to one another often have their
roots grow together. Vascular diseases such as oak wilt are easily transmitted
from infected trees to healthy ones through such shared tissue. If your
neighbor's trees are within 50 feet of your trees, it is likely their roots have
grafted together. Those root grafts must be severed before your neighbor's trees
are removed.

This can be done by digging a 3-foot deep trench between infected and healthy
trees or by killing the grafts chemically with a soil fumigant. If infected
trees are removed before the root grafts are broken, fungus-laden sap from the
infected trees can "backwash" into your trees' vascular systems.

Infected trees should be removed as soon as possible once the root grafts have
been broken. There is no chemical control for oak wilt once symptoms are
apparent in more than 30 percent of the crown.

Destroy the wood immediately, including the stump, by burning, burying or
removing the bark so that it is not attractive to the insects responsible for
the spread of oak wilt. Do not stack the wood for firewood or transport logs
with intact bark because insects in the infected wood can leave and carry the
fungal spores to healthy trees.

Perhaps the most important way to prevent healthy trees from being infected is
to prune oaks only when they are dormant, from late November to mid-April.

If oaks are damaged in a summer storm, some pathologists recommend cleaning up
the damage and painting the pruning cuts with wound dressing to avoid attracting
the bark and sap beetles that spread oak wilt fungi.

Oak wilt occurs in the United States in an area delineated by Minnesota, Texas,
Pennsylvania and South Carolina. It is found west of the Susquehanna River in
Pennsylvania. Although all oaks can be infected, those in the red oak group are
most susceptible. These include northern red oak (Quercus rubra), pin oak (Q.
palustris), black oak (Q. velutina) and scarlet oak (Q. coccinea).

Chestnut trees are also susceptible, including American (Castanea dentata),
Chinese (C. mollisima), European (C. sativa) and bush chinquapin (C. pumila).
Susceptible trees can die within a few weeks of infection.

Species in the white oak group are less susceptible. These include white oak (Q.
alba), swamp white oak (Q. bicolor), bur oak (Q. macrocarpa), and post oak (Q.
stellata). When trees in this group are infected, they may decline over a two-
to three-year period, or the disease may go into remission and they recover.

Oak wilt symptoms vary according to oak species and geographical area.
Generally, for red oak group trees in our area symptoms start near the top of
the tree and progress downward.

Leaves on infected trees turn dull green, then bronze, and browning is
frequently evident at the leaf tips or margins. Sometimes the leaves droop and
curl lengthwise. Browning may also occur along the veins. Leaves at the ends of
branches begin to fall soon after symptoms become noticeable, and often drop
while they are still green.

Twigs and branches die, and you may be able to see brown streaks in the sapwood
of infected trees but not always. Leaf discoloration and defoliation continue
throughout the crown of the tree for several weeks until it's dead.

Symptoms in the white oak group are similar but advance much more slowly and do
not cause the sudden defoliation and death seen in the red oak group. The
symptoms are often confined to a single branch and can look like typical fall
coloration.

Oklahoma City Thunder: What exactly is going on with Kevin Durant's foot?

BYLINE: By Anthony Slater

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 665 words


On Friday afternoon, the Thunder officially ruled Kevin Durant out for the
remainder of the season. After a variety of setbacks the past couple months, it
didn't come as surprising news. But the additional details surrounding the
announcement were worrisome.For the third time in less than six months, Durant
will have sur gery on his bothersome right foot. The latest is a bone graft
procedure scheduled for early next week in New York.

It comes with a 4-to-6 month recovery timetable - easily the longest of the
three surgeries - and sets his projected return to basketball activity between
late July and late September, right at the heels of training camp.This latest
step was decided upon after week-long consultation between three of the
country's premier foot and ankle specialists - Dr. Martin O'Malley in New York
City, Dr. James Nunley at Duke University and Dr. Robert Anderson in Charlotte,
who performed the first two surgeries.After the Jones fracture was discovered in
his right foot during training camp, Durant had the original surgery, which
knocked him out six weeks, and a screw inserted to help with the healing. The
second surgery, performed in late February, was to replace that screw, which was
irritating the foot by rubbing against his bone and causing continued
soreness.Just last week, with the soreness remaining an issue even through minor
workouts, Durant's latest comeback attempt was shut down and the specialists
were consulted."While the majority of the soreness in Kevin's foot was related
to continued inflammation of the cuboid bone and would subside with rest,"
Thunder general manager Sam Presti said in a press release Friday afternoon,
"the evaluation process also determined that the Jones fracture of the fifth
metatarsal, which had shown significant healing previously, was now
demonstrating signs of regression."Jones fracture surgeries have a success rate
of between 92 percent to 95 percent. "It's a little unusual that this didn't
heal," Dr. Steven B. Weinfeld, a foot and ankle specialist from the Icahn School
of Medicine at Mount Sinai, said. "Once you put the screw in, these usually heal
reliably."But Durant is now an unfortunate member of that minority group."The
bone graft is the standard procedure for the 5e to 8 perce nt of Jones fracture
surgeries that do not initially have success or experience setbacks sometime
within the recovery period," Presti said. "While everyone is disappointed that
Kevin falls into that group, we are encouraged that the bone graft procedure has
historically demonstrated long-term health and stability."Nets center Brook
Lopez suffered a Jones fracture in December 2011. That offseason, similar to
Durant, Lopez had the screw in his foot replaced. He returned the next season
and played 74 games.But in January 2014, Lopez had a recurrence of that Jones
fracture and an additional surgery. The procedure, which included some bone
grafting, was done by O'Malley and Nunley, two of the three who were consulted
on Durant's case. O'Malley will perform Durant's surgery early next
week."Basically the idea is to bring bone-healing cells to the area that's not
healing," Weinfeld said of a bone graft procedure. "There are lots of different
ways to do the graft, but what they're trying to do is get the body to restart
the healing process. Because after six months of that, which is about what it's
been, the body stops trying to heal."The team remains optimistic that this
latest surgery will alleviate the problem for good. Bone grafting comes with a
longer return timetable, but has an extremely high success rate."That (4-to-6
month) timeline sounds about right," Weinfeld said. "If this bone graft
procedure works, it's going to take two to three months to know that. Then once
you know it's healed, you can let him go a little harder. I wouldn't think he'd
be able to start heavy running for three months. Then you need at least a month
to get back in shape. So I think that ballpark is about right."

Tutogen bone-graft products entering spinal repair market

Tutogen bone-graft products entering spinal repair market

By HOLLAND JOHNSON Medical Device Daily Staff Writer At Tutogen Medical's
(Clifton, New Jersey) annual shareholders meeting last week, President and CEO
Manfred Krueger reported that the company is on the verge of launching its first
structural bone grafts.

There are approximately 189,000 allograft structural bone fusions performed
annually in the U.S., according to the company.

Tutogen Medical, which develops biologic products for a number of different
medical conditions, has an exclusive agreement with Sulzer Spine-Tech
(Minneapolis, Minnesota), a subsidiary of Sulzer Medica (Winterthur,
Switzerland), to distribute its spinal implant products. Sulzer Medica USA
acquired a 37% stake Tutogen in January (Medical Device Week, Jan. 4, 2001)

Richard Lunsford, president of Sulzer Spine-Tech, spoke at the Tutogen
shareholders' meeting and noted that Spine-Tech had studied potential partners
in biologics, and determined that Tutogen was the best possible choice for his
company. He cited Tutogen's extensive history and strong safety record as key
factors in that decision.

"The company many years ago developed a tissue preparation process," said
Tutogen spokesman Michael Brod, "which is like a six-step process, and no prions
have been detected in the materials that the company has shipped out in its
25-year history."

Tutogen uses the patented Tutoplast process of tissue preservation and viral
inactivation, to manufacture bioimplants for neurosurgical, orthopedic,
reconstructive and general surgical indications. The products that use this
process "have an extended shelf life of up to five years and are storable at
room temperatures," Brod told Medical Device Daily. "Most of the other products
that are available as biological implants are either freeze-dried or
flash-frozen. Neither of those processes destroy prions."

He added that "the biological implant, without question, is superior to plastic
or metal. At the earliest stages of this industry, mostly these products were
just thought of as tissue - they weren't looked at as medical devices." But with
the advent of surgical techniques, he said, "the product began to be packaged as
a complete kit. In other words, the doctor gets the kit; he's not just getting a
piece of bone and having to use his own tools to put it in." Brod said that
everything became specified, meaning there were spinal kits, dental kits and so
on. "It's like the old Heathkits in which you could build your own television or
stereo," and like those, the Tutogen kits "come complete."

Lunsford said Spine-Tech's marketing launch of the new structural bone grafts
will begin this summer. "Over 150 of the Spine-Tech sales staff, clinical
specialists and distributors have received extensive training in preparation for
the new products rollout." He added, "the allograft market is growing at a rate
of 15% to 20% annually. We have had strong interest in the traditional Tutogen
bone products that were launched last fall, and feel confident that we will be
able to capture significant market share with these new structural bone grafts."

The total market, Brod said, "is somewhere north of $100 million annually for
allograft material for biological spine parts, and that's expected to grow
significantly."

Brod compared the allograft market to that of laser eye surgery. "When [laser
surgery] first became available, it was $2,000 an eyeball, and medical insurance
wasn't covering it. Now it's down to $1,500 for both eyes, and is accessible to
virtually everyone."

He noted that another promising indication for allografts is in the dental
field. "You can get a dental implant from anywhere between $750 and $1,000.
Would you rather put a permanent graft in, or risk adjacent teeth to a dental
bridge?"

In addition to Sulzer Spine-Tech, "we have made deals with Sulzer Calcitek for
dental applications and Sulzer's R&D department for other biological
applications," Brod said, noting that Tutogen has reserved the trauma
marketplace for itself.

Brod noted that Tutogen's competitors in the allograft market include Osteotech
(Eatontown, New Jersey) and Regeneration Technologies (Alachua, Florida).

Graft pays off as experts solve knee op riddle

BYLINE: Alice McKeegan

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 31

LENGTH: 300 words


A NEW technique could revolutionise knee surgery for sportsmen and save the NHS
thousands of pounds per patient.

A plastic pin invented by researchers in Manchester is implanted in the knee of
patients recovering from anterior cruciate ligament injuries.

It is one of the top five injuries suffered by professional footballers, with
11,000 reconstructions carried out on the NHS each year. But the surgery is not
always successful, with up to one in four operations failing.

United striker Michael Owen famously suffered the injury in England's opening
2006 World Cup match against Sweden, putting him out of action for more than a
year. The ligament stabilises the knee joint, but can snap under pressure.

It is commonly repaired using the patient's hamstring tendons to form a graft
that is inserted in the shin and upper leg bones.

But the graft can often pop out, meaning patients have to undergo multiple
operations at a cost of  £3,000 a time.

Now, researchers at the University of Manchester working with Manchester-based
innovation company TrusTECH and an NHS surgeon at Wythenshawe Hospital, have
come up with an alternative to repair the damage first time.

They have devised a plastic plug GraftBolt which pins the graft to the shin bone
during the operation, securing it in place. They have struck a deal with a
leading orthopaedic device company Arthrex INC, meaning it will be used in
procedures across Britain and the United States.

The inventors have been awarded the 2011 PraxisUnico Collaborative Impact Award
for their exceptional team work' in developing the device. Dr Joanne Thomas,
senior technology manager at TrusTECH, said: The development of GraftBolt is an
excellent example of how a surgeon, university, a company and an NHS Innovation
Hub can work together to develop a new product.

hemodialysis. The graft includes a body having first and second ends, and a wall
to define a passageway formed in the body. The wall includes a plurality of
tubular layers, such as a first layer and one or more second layers disposed
radially inward relative to the first layer. Each second layer has first and
second ends that can be enclosable. The second layer is removable from the graft
body from within the passageway of the graft body after clot formation. A

Fetal Tissue Heals Burns;
Tests Show Treatment Led to Normal Skin Regrowth

BYLINE: David Brown, Washington Post Staff Writer

SECTION: A Section; A02

LENGTH: 766 words


An experimental therapy that uses skin cells grown from an aborted fetus
successfully healed severe burns in eight children, sparing them the need for
skin grafts, according to a study published today.

The treatment led to the regrowth of essentially normal skin on second- and
third-degree burns in about two weeks, according to the report by a Swiss
research team. The scarring and tissue contraction seen after many burns did not
occur, and dressing changes were easier and less painful, the researchers said.

The fetal tissue promotes growth of the patient's own skin cells rather than
becoming incorporated into the recipient's skin as a true "graft." Further, it
appears that a piece of fetal skin smaller than a postage stamp could be used to
produce enough cells to treat hundreds of patients.

"The results were sort of unexpected. . . . These constructs seem to work as a
biological Band-Aid, promoting spontaneous healing of the patient," said Patrick
Hohlfeld of University Hospital of Lausanne, who was one of the researchers.

The study will appear in a future edition of  the Lancet and was published
online today.

Cells grown from the foreskin of circumcised newborns and large pieces of skin
removed from cadavers are sometimes used to cover burns and promote healing. The
Swiss researchers were the first to use cells from a fetus  --  a 14-week male
whose mother gave permission at the time of abortion.

Burns that destroy the outer skin layer  --  the epidermis  --  heal on their
own. Ones that go deep into the second layer  --  the dermis  --  require skin
grafts, patches of skin sliced off one part of the body, often the thigh, and
transferred to the burned area. So-called  third-degree  burns that destroy the
entire dermis and leave muscle or bone exposed also need grafts.

Several burn experts said the technique sounded promising, but its usefulness is
not yet proved.

"I can't say whether it's a leap forward before we know how it compares with
standard wound care," said Roger W. Yurt, head of the burn center at Weill
Cornell Medical Center, in New York.

"This is certainly work worth following with great eagerness. But in the absence
of comparisons,  it would be very difficult to assess the difference that the
fetal cells bring," said Robert Sheridan, chief of burn medicine at Shriners
Hospital for Children in Boston.

Deciding which second-degree burns need skin grafts is often a matter of
judgment.

"Were they helping heal a burn that was going to heal on its own?" asked Gary
Purdue, director of the burn center at Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas.
"It's good if it helps do that, but it may be only an incremental advance."

The Swiss researchers used a patch of fetal skin 1.5 inches square. They grew
cells from it in tissue culture and let the cells spread out on sheets of a
material called collagen, forming a kind of artificial skin. They cut that into
pieces  31/2 by 5 inches and placed about four of them on 10-day-old burns in
eight children. The burns were second- and third-degree, they said, and all
would normally have undergone skin grafting.

The fetal-cell material disappeared, but it was not incorporated into the
regenerating skin. The scientists determined that by testing the genes in a
piece of skin taken from a healed burn in a female patient. The skin contained
no male cells, which it would have if it contained any of the fetal material.

Skin cells secrete numerous chemical "growth factors" that cause progenitor skin
cells to divide, spread out and attach to one another. Exactly how they differ
from the cells of newborns or adults is uncertain.

"We are very busy with the characterization of these cells and their
byproducts," Hohlfeld said.

A main problem with healed but heavily scarred burns is that they contract,
limiting the motion of joints. Grafts frequently leave an uneven contour on the
skin surface. Neither of these problems occurred in the eight children,
according to the report. There was "total recovery of mobility, especially in
hands and fingers."

The patients have been followed for one to two years. There was some color
change in some areas, but the overall appearance of the healed burns was good,
Hohlfeld said.

The team calculated that the small piece taken in this case could ultimately
produce more than 2 million of the squares that were put on the burns.

One fetus could theoretically provide material for hundreds or thousands of burn
victims, although Hohlfeld said he suspected that would not remove some people's
objections to the use of tissue from an aborted fetus.

Novabone Launches Bioactive Strip

LENGTH: 454  words


Washington, D.C.: Biotechnology Industry Organization has issued the following
news release:

Novabone Bioactive Strip provides more bioactivity than any other competitive
product

Novabone Products, a medical device company, announces the release of NovaBone
Bioactive Strip®, its third technology platform provided to the orthopedic
community based on the combination of bioactive glass and bovine collagen.

NovaBone Bioactive Strip® is a bone graft composed of purified fibrillar
collagen and resorbable bioactive synthetic morsels. The open structure allows
for rapid vascularization and mineralization and permits complete device
absorption and replacement by new bone. The compression resistant, formable and
moldable bone graft creates a highly Osteoconductive Matrix for new bone growth.
The strip's optimal composition and pore size is designed to mimic cancellous
bone.

"This past September, we announced the launch of MacroFORM Packable Graft and
MacroFORM Composite. Both of those products are designed to be hydrated with
bone marrow aspirate and then molded into a putty type format and were the first
of a new bioactive collagen line designed for use in orthopedic surgeries," said
Art Wotiz, President of NovaBone Products. "We feel the strip will be
well-received because of its ability to absorb and retain bone marrow aspirate
while it remains to be easy to handle and place."

The new Novabone Bioactive Strip® is 95% bioglass dispersed in a collagen matrix
in a preformed shape that is cross linked using a proprietary process that
avoids the use of aldehydes alleviating any concern of residual aldehyde
contamination. After hydration with bone marrow aspirate, the cross linked
device retains its shape even after manipulation.

Novabone Products also offers a complete line of bioactive products designed to
be used as packaged with no manipulation required. These ready-to-use products
include Novabone Bioactive Synthetic Putty®, Novabone Bioactive Synthetic Putty
MIS Cartridge Delivery System®, Novabone MacroPor Si+ Bioactive Bone Graft®,

When root stock overtakes orange tree graft; benefits to raised beds

BYLINE: Karl Zedell Sr.

SECTION: Garden Q&A; Pg. D-7

LENGTH: 806 words


I have a very sour orange tree that used to be sweet and has now sprouted really
long thorns everywhere. What's going on?

It sounds like the root stock has taken over the tree. Most citrus is actually
two trees in one. First is a hardy root stock that grows well in our Florida
soils. The second is the fruit producing part (called the scion) and it is
grafted to the root stock about 4 to 10 inches above the soil line.

Sometimes, the root stock will sprout and overtake the scion. It is called
reversion and may happen because the scion dies, or severe pruning of the scion
spurs the root stock into sprouting. Sometimes the scion dies back in a freeze.

Look near the base of the tree and find the graft. If there is any desirable
citrus growing above the graft, you simply prune everything that has sprouted
below the graft. If there is no visible desirable citrus (scion), the tree will
never be productive and you can keep it as an ornamental, or remove the tree.
Homeowners used to be able to re-graft reverted trees. This is now only allowed
with certified disease-free bud wood, and rootstock obtained from the Florida
Department of Agriculture.

I keep hearing that a raised bed would be more productive than ground level
Florida soil. Is that right and if so, why?

To give you a simple analogy, gardening in a raised bed is similar to gardening
in a container. Why? Your plants have no contact with the soil and, therefore,
no contact with diseases or critters which may be living in your soil. In
addition, proper assembly can minimize weed problems.

For very detailed instructions on how to build and use a raised bed, see
edis.ifas.ufl.edu/ep472 by Duval Extension horticulturist Terry Brite DelValle.
Here are some bullet points on the benefits of raised gardening beds:

- Raised beds are easier on the joints because there is less bending.

- You control the soil in the bed using a healthy medium free of soil diseases
and pests.

- You can produce more in a raised bed because there is no need for walking rows
between plants.

- You choose the garden site for the right amount of sun and convenience of a
water source.

- You can select a good, light-weight soilless medium which can be carefully
improved and monitored.

- If you decide to change your landscape the raised bed can be dismantled and
moved elsewhere.

I want to add to my azalea beds. Can I do that now, or should I wait until
spring?

Azalea blooms are the favorite of many a gardener in Northeast Florida. While
their flowers are delicate, the plants are sturdy and bloom year to year with
just a little love and care. While you see the biggest number of azalea plants
for sale in the early spring, now is actually a better time to transplant them
because it gives them a better chance to establish. Multiplying these blooming
beauties in the winter months is an advantage.

Healthy transplants should be placed in a hole that is about 12 inches wider
than the root mass. You might well notice a tangle of roots when you take the
plant out of the pot.

Gently break up the root ball before placing it in your prepared bed. Place it
in the soil just even to, or a tiny bit above, the level it was at in the
container. Amendments to the soil? Not really needed, especially if you already
have a healthy stand of azaleas. (If this is a brand new space for azaleas, you
will want to plant in slightly acidic and well-draining soil.)

While establishing your new plants in sandy soil they need frequent watering
(two to three times a week) and an acid-forming fertilizer as needed. For more
information, see edis.ifas.ufl.edu/mg019.

How far apart should azaleas be planted? Consider how big they will be when
mature, not how big they are now. Three to 5 feet is just about right, but this
is dependent on the variety (there are dwarf types, and that spacing would be
way too big). These delicate blossoms love to bloom in dappled light, but not
heavy shade. One of the best things about azaleas is the array of color.

The Florida Flame blooms even before the leaves unfurl. It is a yellow-orange
bloom that has a bit of a scent. For more information, go to
edis.ifas.ufl.edu/fp503.

Your yard can become your painting palate as long as you pay attention to the
soil and sun requirements of these heralds of spring.

Fenestrated AAA graft from Cook to enhance endovascular 'toolbox'

LENGTH: 809 words


Fenestrated AAA graft from Cook to enhance endovascular 'toolbox'

By HOLLAND JOHNSON   Medical Device Daily Associate Managing Editor  Cook
(Bloomington, Indiana) reported last week that it received the first clearance
in the U.S. to begin investigational use of a "fenestrated" endovascular graft
for complex abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs).

The company said that the FDA has approved investigational use of its Zenith
Fenestrated AAA Endovascular Graft to treat abdominal aortic or aortoiliac
aneurysms. The fenestrated device is highly customized to meet the anatomic
needs of each individual patient. It incorporates scallops at the top and
openings in the graft wall, called fenestrations, that allow it to be implanted
precisely in the aorta across adjacent blood vessels without blocking blood flow
through those vessels.

"If you think of a standard Zenith AAA graft," company spokesperson David
McCarty told Medical Device Daily, "that device deploys barbs above the renal
arteries so the blood can flow through the renals, then the graft material
starts below the renals and is used to treat aneurysms that are confined
exclusively to the abdominal aorta."

In contrast, he said that while the fenestrated version of the graft uses
essentially the same stent graft technology, "it is designed in such a way that
it can treat aneurysms that also extend to the renal arteries and above."

The agency approved Cook's investigational device exemption (IDE) application
for clinical studies at five U.S. medical institutions involving 25 patients.

The product, an investigational device not yet approved for sale in the U.S., is
designed to treat patients with complex AAAs considered unable to be effectively
treated with standard endograft technologies.

The device is based on Cook's FDA-approved Zenith AAA endovascular graft design,
a device that was cleared for sale in the U.S. in May of last year. The system
is already approved for sale in Australia and is available as a custom device in
Europe.

"Cook continues to build on the success of its Zenith AAA endograft technology
with the fenestrated graft," said Kem Hawkins, president and CEO of Cook. "This
graft is highly customized and designed to treat the five percent to 10% of
patients who have limited options for treatment due to nonfavorable aortic
anatomies. We're eager to begin enrolling patients in this trial and to explore
a less-traumatic treatment for complex AAA cases here as we have elsewhere in
the world."

AAA is a life-threatening condition that occurs when a section of the abdominal
aorta, the body's main circulatory vessel, weakens and bulges outward to form a
fragile, balloon-like swelling - an aneurysm. If the aneurysm ruptures, the
patient is at high risk for death from internal bleeding.

The current treatment option for patients with complex AAAs involving vessels in
addition to the aorta is open surgery, posing a significant health risk for many
older patients who also may suffer from other medical conditions such as
diabetes or hypertension.

Standard endovascular technology, where a tube-like endograft crafted from
surgical graft material and stainless steel Z-stent bodies is deployed within
the aorta to reduce pressure on the aneurysm, typically is not an option for
patients with complex abdominal aortic aneurysms.

The Zenith Fenestrated AAA Endovascular Graft is fabricated from woven polyester
vascular graft material hand-sewn to self-expanding Z-stent bodies. It's
customized to meet each patient's aortic anatomy, which can be challenging due
to tortuosity, length or size.

Without this fenestrated graft McCarty said surgeons would have to put a fabric
tube down through the aorta that would block the renal arteries and several
other small blood vessels that come off of the aorta.

"Basically, this just allows the physician a broader range of options when it
comes to treating patients with a more complex aneurysmal disease," he said.

Cook's fenestrated graft is one of several aortic endovascular therapies using
Zenith's patented Z-stent endograft design. The company also is in U.S. clinical
trials with the Zenith TX2 endograft designed to treat aneurysms in the
descending thoracic aorta and is developing endografts for use in emergency
cases where the aneurysm has already ruptured.

While the new graft may not treat a vast patient population, McCarty pointed out
that Cook's approach to this market is to have a device to meet all the needs of
the endovascular surgeon. "We want to be the toolbox that every endovascular
surgeon specialist can turn to," he said.

To date, more than 14,000 Zenith endografts from Cook have been placed in
patients worldwide, and more than 1,350 U.S. physicians have received clinical
instruction in what Cook calls its "industry-unique Zenith physician training
program."

Scotts Valley firefighter injured in head-on hit-and-run crash needs skin graft
surgery; driver was not licensed

BYLINE: Shanna McCord, Santa Cruz Sentinel, Calif.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 346 words


Nov. 22--The driver responsible for a head-on collision on Highway 46 near Lost
Hills on Nov. 14 that seriously injured a Scotts Valley firefighter and his
father has been identified as Juan Rodriguez Villa.

Villa, who has been through several surgeries and is still in the hospital
recovering from burns and lacerations from the accident, is facing charges of
driving without a license and passing without sufficient clearance, the
California Highway Patrol said.

Villa was driving a 1993 Honda Accord east on Highway 46 when he tried to pass
other eastbound drivers. Villa couldn't get back in his lane in time to avoid
hitting the westbound Mini Cooper driven by firefighter Christopher Stubendorf,
34, whose father Richard Stubendorf, 61, of Scotts Valley was a passenger.

Villa, 27, is a migrant worker who lives in Coachella, CHP officer Mariska
Bentley said.

Villa's brother, who was a few cars ahead and turned around when he saw the
crash, took Villa from the accident and drove him to John F. Kennedy Memorial
Hospital in Indio, about 300 miles away, Bentley said.

Christoper and Richard Stubendorf were taken to Kern Medical Center in
Bakersfield.

Richard Stubendorf has been released from the hospital, while Christopher, who
resides in Paso Robles, requires skin graft surgery for the open fracture on his
lower right leg, according to Scotts Valley Fire Chief Mike McMurry.

Christopher Stubendorf is planning to be transferred to Stanford Hospital on
Wednesday for the skin grafts, McMurry said.

"It's pretty serious," McMurry said. "All things considered, he's upbeat and
optimistic."

The Stubendorfs were heading to Christopher's Paso Robles home after a weekend
of watching races in Riverside County when they were hit.

Product Briefs

o Affymetrix (Santa Clara, California) reported publication of the "MicroArray
Quality Control (MAQC)" study, a collaborative effort led by the FDA that
included 137 scientists from private and public sector laboratories. Affymetrix
and other microarray and reagent manufacturers participated in the two-year
initiative to address the reproducibility of data generated from microarrays.
The study, published in the Sept. 8 issue of Nature Biotechnology, demonstrated
that at a high level, gene expression signatures generated by microarrays are
repeatable, further advancing the field towards widespread use in clinical
applications. Affymetrix makes high-density microarray technology.

o Bovie Medical (Melville, New York) reported receiving FDA 510(k) clearance to
market the Icon GI for gastroenterological procedures. Bovie says the GI device
includes digital output, a touch screen interface, physician preference
database, neutral electrode monitoring, and common sense messages. Bovie makes
electrosurgical products.

o FoxHollow Technologies (Redwood City, California) reported on the use of
NightHawk, which FoxHollow says brings together optical coherence tomography
(OCT) technology with the FDA-cleared SilverHawk System to allow for plaque
removal in patients suffering from blocked arteries in the lower legs. The
company said that the NightHawk technology is being evaluated through a
feasibility study at a hospital in Poland. The NightHawk System uses fiber optic
technology embedded in a catheter. While removing plaque, the physician can
visualize the intravascular placement of the device within the vessel. Other
advantages of OCT include reduced use of potentially harmful X-ray imaging and
contrast dye, which may present risks to patients with pre-existing kidney or
heart conditions. "I was extremely impressed with the performance of the
NightHawk and its ability to provide real-time images inside the arteries of the
lower legs," said Greg Robertson, MD. "This enables the treating physician to
visualize target tissue," he added. FoxHollow makes minimally invasive plaque
excision devices to treat peripheral artery disease.

o Medtronic (Memphis, Tennessee) reported that an article in The Journal of Bone
and Joint Surgery (June 2006) shows that INFUSE Bone Graft, recombinant human
Bone Morphogenetic Protein-2 (rhBMP-2) on an absorbable collagen sponge, helped
patients with severe tibial (lower leg) trauma heal sooner and reduced the need
for a follow-up bone graft to treat a delayed mending of the treated bones.
Patients who received INFUSE Bone Graft also had a significantly lower rate of
post-operative infection and could place load-bearing weight on their injured
legs faster than those who did not receive INFUSE Bone Graft.     o Ophthalmic
International (Fountain Hills, Arizona) a subsidiary of Coronado Industries,
reported that it will initiate direct marketing of its Pneumatic Trabeculoplasty
(PNT) product in Canada. This follows the granting of a Medical Device License
by Health Canada in June 2006. Ophthalmic International makes products to treat
glaucoma, and ocular hypertension.

Financings roundup

Intuitive slates $115M IPO; Esurg.com raises $20 million

A Medical Device Week Staff Report   Intuitive Surgical (Mountain View,
California), a developer of computer-enhanced surgical systems, last week filed
for an initial public offering to raise up to $115 million.

This is the second such filing for the company, having withdrawn in 1998 an IPO
that was intended to raise about $50 million. At that time, the company cited
unfavorable terms for the offering and withdrew it two months after the initial
filing.

While stating the approximate amount it wishes to raise, the company said it
would release figures concerning the number of shares and price range in future
SEC filings. Proceeds, it said, will go to support the full range of corporate
operations, from product R&D to future marketing.

The company's primary product is the da Vinci Surgical System, a
computer-enhanced platform for performing surgery through small incisions and
featuring intuitive instrument control, natural range of motion, fine tissue
manipulation capability and 3-D visualization. Intuitive reports 14
installations of the da Vinci system.

The company has applied to the FDA for use of the system in laparoscopic
surgeries in the abdominal and pelvic areas and is hoping for approval sometime
this spring.

Esurg.com (Seattle, Washington) reported raising $20 million in second-round
financing. The funding will be used for expansion of sales and marketing
activities, technology enhancements and general corporate purposes, the company
said. Esurg.com is a privately held online distributor that provides medical,
surgical and pharmaceutical supplies and specialty-specific information for the
physician market.

In other financings:

· CardioTech International (Woburn, Massachusetts) reported raising $1.25
million through the voluntary exercise of 839,000 common stock purchase
warrants. The company said the funds will be used primarily for marketing and
distribution of its Vasculink Vascular Access Graft overseas, and development of
the MyoLink Peripheral Graft. CardioTech develops small-bore vascular graft
devices using Chronoflex polyurethane materials, and its CT Biomaterials
Division makes polymer-based materials. As part of a private financing in late
1998, Cardiotech issued approximately 1.8 million common stock purchase warrants
to subscribers. To date, it has just under 1.03 million warrants outstanding
approximating $1.5 million in additional available working capital.

· First Circle Medical (Minneapolis, Minnesota) said it has closed a $5.5
million Series B capital round of private equity, boosting the company's
valuation to just over $20 million. First Circle said it will use this capital
support marketing, upon CE mark approval, for its TEMET system, an
extracorporeal whole body hyperthermia device for treating viral disease and
certain cancers. The funds will also support, in the U.S., the firm's Phase II
clinical trials studying the efficacy of EWBH with drug-resistant AIDS and
Hepatitis C (HCV) patients. The company is scheduled to launch a multiple site
trial in June targeting HCV patients non-responsive to interferon. This
technology permits blood to be removed from a closely monitored patient, heated
to a desired temperature, and returned to the body.

· InfoMedics (Woburn, Massachusetts), a provider of Internet marketing solutions
for the pharmaceutical industry, has secured $6 million in financing from
existing investors, including Sutter Hill Ventures (Palo Alto, California);
North Bridge Venture Partners (Waltham, Massachusetts); United Health Capital's
Validus LP (Minnetonka, Minnesota), and Johnson & Johnson Development Corp. (New
Brunswick, New Jersey). Funds will be used to expand operations, enlarge its
sales force and advance the marketing of its Brand Accelerator product
portfolio.

· Metrika (Sunnyvale, California) a developer of point-of-care diagnostics for
diabetes monitoring, has completed $4.25 million of a $7 million private
placement from new and existing investors and expects to complete the remaining
financing by the end of April. Proceeds will finance production scale-up and
worldwide launch of the company's DRx HbA1c, which it calls "the world's first
disposable quantitative test for glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c)," a simple blood
test to determine long-term glucose control for people with diabetes. The test
can run both immunoassays and chemistry tests in a single disposable device. The
company has submitted clinical data to the FDA and is predicting U.S. marketing
by year's end. The company said it plans to launch the product internationally
before FDA clearance in 2Q00.

· Organogenesis (Canton, Massachusetts) said it has received $5 million in an
advance milestone payment from Novartis Pharma AG, due to the continued progress
toward gaining diabetic foot ulcer regulatory approval for Apligraf. Novartis
Pharma AG has global Apligraf marketing rights and markets Apligraf in the U.S.
through its subsidiary Novartis Pharmaceuticals

· Sparta Surgical (Concord, California) has raised $2.55 million through the
combined conversion of $1.29 million of debt into shares of common stock and the
purchase of common stock in the amount of $1.26 million. The company also
obtained a new $2.5 million revolving line of credit with Bank of America
Commercial Finance. Sparta said the equity restructuring takes it closer to
Nasdaq listing in order to facilitate future financing and broader coverage by
the investment community. Additionally, the funding will be used to develop a
disposable electrosurgical cautery instrument used for cutting tissues in deep
cavity surgical procedures.

Idaho:Gardener's Twofer: First Ketchup 'N' Fries Plant Hits U.S. Market

LENGTH: 883  words

DATELINE: Boise


American Falls District Library of Idaho has issued the followinga news release:

Love growing potatoes and tomatoes? This spring, gardeners in the U.S. (and
Europe) will be able to get both tuber and fruit from a single plant.

It even has a catchy name: Ketchup 'n' Fries.

"It's like a science project," says Alice Doyle of SuperNaturals Grafted
Vegetables, the company that's licensing the variety for U.S. markets from the
U.K. company that developed it. "It's something that is really bizarre, but it's
going to be fun [for gardeners] to measure and see how it grows."

This isn't a genetically modified organism but a plant of two different
nightshades: the top of a cherry tomato grafted on to a white potato.

"Tomatoes and potatoes are in the same family and that makes it feasible," says
John Bagnasco, also of SuperNaturals.

Grafting, the technique of taking two different plants in the same family and
fusing them together, has been around since ancient times. Today, fruit trees,
grape vines and roses are still grafted onto well-established rootstocks. (A New
York artist is even attempting to graft branches from 40 different kinds of
stone fruit onto a single tree, as The Salt reported in August.)

Grafting is advantageous for higher yields and disease resistance. For example,
a tree that is genetically resistant to soil diseases might not produce a juicy
peach or a perfectly tart apple. So plant breeders can take branches from trees
with tastier fruit and graft them onto the hardy rootstocks.
Sam Van Aken's grafted fruit trees are still quite young, but this artist
rendering shows what he expects the "Tree of 40 Fruit" to look like in
springtime in a few years.
The Salt
The Gift Of Graft: New York Artist's Tree To Grow 40 Kinds Of Fruit
Guerrilla grafter Tara Hui grafts a fruiting pear branch onto an ornamental
fruit tree in the San Francisco Bay Area. She doesn't want the location known
because the grafting is illegal.

Guerrilla Grafters Bring Forbidden Fruit Back To City Trees

Over the last century, botanists have discovered vegetable or soft-tissue
grafting. Grafters will take two separate seedlings -- with stems of the same
size and shape -- and cut them in half. The top of one is then matched with the
wound of the bottom. They are fused with a tiny plastic clip and taken into a
special greenhouse while they grow into one plant. If the combination is
correct, the whole organism should be stronger.

This idea of the tomato-potato twofer isn't actually new either. In the early
1900s, botanist Luther Burbank successfully grafted a potato top onto a tomato
root, creating a viable plant -- except that it was, shall we say, fruitless. He
even experimented with a tomato-potato hybrid, affectionately named a "pomato."
Since then, home gardeners have experimented with these Chimera-esque grafted
plants to varying success.

Finding the right partners is tricky at best. You have to find two plants that
work well together to produce a balanced harvest of fruit and tubers.

"If you're growing a potato from a seed, as the potato germinates, the stem is
much thinner than a tomato when it germinates," says Bagnasco. "You have to
start the seeds at separate times and try to get the potatoes' stem up to size."

The plant is an early tomato grafted to a late-producing potato. The two can be
harvested throughout the season. i

harvested throughout the season.
SuperNaturals

After five years of experimenting, SuperNaturals decided to license an already
successful variety developed for Thomas & Morgan, a U.K.-based plant company.
About 40,000 TomTatoes were sold last year in the U.K., says Michael Perry, a
product development manager for Thomas & Morgan who worked on TomTato. He says
the goal was to make a combination that was more than a novelty plant.

"It's not just any old tomato or any old potato. It's actually a really good,
all-around potato at the base," Perry says. "Then on the top you've got the
potential to have up to 500 super-sweet fruit."
The nearly translucent Glass Gem Corn looks more like a work of art than a
vegetable.
The Salt
Gardeners' Gems: Designer Crops That Will Wow The Neighbors

They also had to find an early tomato and late-producing potato, so the two
could be harvested throughout the season. It took 15 years to develop the
winning combination.

The TomTato is being released as Ketchup 'N' Fries in the U.S. this spring, and
the producers say the plant is sparking new interest in gardening. Perry says it
wasn't just his usual customers who were interested in this last year in the
U.K.

"It was also teenagers and kids -- people who wouldn't have been interested
before, so it kind of opened it to a wider audience," he says.

SuperNaturals says garden centers across the country will be stocking Ketchup
'N' Fries in the spring. It's also available online at Garden America and at the
Territorial Seed Co.

Federal U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reverses Johns Hopkins' win on
clot-busting device

BYLINE: Brendan Kearney

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 307  words


A New Jersey company's bloodclot-buster does not infringe three patents the
Johns Hopkins University licensed to a medical device manufacturer, a divided
appeals court has held.

The decision by the Federal U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed last year's
jury award of nearly $700,000 in U.S. District Court in Baltimore.

Hopkins' licensee, Arrow International Inc. of Reading, Pa., produces the
Arrow-Trerotola PTD, which uses a basket-shaped device to break up clot-causing
material along the walls of vascular grafts in hemodialysis patients.

Datascope Corp. makes a device called ProLumen, which uses an S-shaped wire for
the same purpose. Hopkins and Arrow claimed ProLumen's wire changes shape in
use, expanding to conform to the inner lumen, or open space of the graft.

In June 2007, the jury found infringement and awarded damages equal to an 18
percent royalty, Arrow announced at the time. The Federal Circuit reversed last
week by a 2-1 vote.

While the Arrow-Trerotola PTD touches the walls of vascular grafts at many
points, Datascope's ProLumen can only ever make contact at two points, the
majority decided last week.

"In a nutshell, that's what the Datascope product was never shown to do, and
never could be, because it's simply not the case," said its lawyer, Roy H.
Wepner.

Kenneth P. George, a New York attorney who represented Hopkins and Arrow, agreed
with the dissent, which would have deferred to the Baltimore jury and Judge
William D. Quarles Jr., who denied post-trial motions.

"There's additional evidence that shows there were more than two points of
contact, but for whatever reason, the appeals court didn't focus on, didn't
find, or didn't see," said George. "The jury didn't miss it, but the appeals
court missed it, which is not surprising because the jury had it for a whole
week. The jury got to see the witnesses. "

FIRST U.S. BRAIN GRAFT GIVES NEW HOPE TO PATIENT

BYLINE: AP

SECTION: Section D; Page 15, Column 3; National Desk

LENGTH: 310 words

DATELINE: NASHVILLE, April 16


The first person to undergo brain graft surgery in this country says it has
given her hope of overcoming Parkinson's disease, and her doctors called it a
breakthrough in treating disorders of the nervous system.

''I'm not shaking at the moment,'' the 42-year-old patient, Dickye Baggett, said
at a news conference Wednesday. ''You do not know how grateful I am.''

Parkinson's disease, which causes tremors and a loss of balance, afflicts nearly
1.5 million Americans.

Mrs. Baggett underwent the graft April 9 at Vanderbilt University Medical
Center, where she appeared for the news conference in a white turban to cover
marks of the brain surgery.

'The Start of an Era'

''This is really the start of an era, where neurosurgeons will be transplanting
other tissues into the brain,'' said Dr. R. Stanley Burns, a member of the
surgical team.

Mrs. Baggett, an insurance clerk who lives near Nashville, said she began
developing symptoms of Parkinson's disease 10 years ago.

''I had to learn how to stir pots with my left hand, and I'm right-handed,'' she
said. ''I had to learn how to print with my left hand.''

Dr. George S. Allen, chairman of the department of neurosurgery at Vanderbilt,
said researchers might not know for months what effect the brain graft would
have on Mrs. Baggett.

A film of the surgery, taken through a microscope used in the operation, showed
Dr. Allen and Dr. Noel B. Tulipan placing adrenal gland cells from near one of
Mrs. Baggett's kidneys and grafting them inside the right half of her brain.

Parkinson's disease is caused when the body no longer produces enough dopamine,
a chemical that allows nerve cells in the brain to communicate. The adrenal
gland produces a similar chemical, but scientists are not sure why the
transplanted tissue appears to ease the symptoms of Parkinson's disease in some
patients.

star to a 6-0 triumph over the host Newmarket Redmen in the atom double-A
championship game at the 64th Newmarket Atom Tournament Sunday evening at the
Magna Centre in Newmarket.

Graft had two goals and set up three others as the Trappers rebounded from an

wins, including a 3-2 semifinal win over the Oshawa Generals, to claim the title
in a rematch of the 2013 championship game won by Newmarket.

over the Uxbridge Stars as Ben Smith and Gavin Ewles scored second period goals
to break open a 1-1 tie.

On the single-A side, Carter Thompson scored the go-ahead goal in the fifth
minute of the third period to send the London Mustangs on to a 2-1 triumph over
the Aurora Tigers in the atom final. Harrison Chant had the other Mustangs goal
while Noah Smith answered for the Tigers.

In minor atom, a goal by Jaeger Gignac just 52 seconds ito the second period
snapped a 2-2 tie and sent Windsor's Riverside Rangers on to a 3-2 victory over
the East Gwillimbury Eagles.

International report: Cook Medical reports getting Canadian approval for Zenith

LENGTH: 1032 words

A Medical Device Daily Staff Report

Cook Medical (Bloomington, Indiana) reported Health Canada approval for the
Zenith Low Profile AAA Endovascular Graft. Cook says the graft has a low-profile
delivery system diameter of 18 Fr and simplified deployment compared to previous
Zenith endograft systems for precise delivery of the graft to the desired
position in the patient's aorta.

Cook will continue offering its existing Zenith Flex AAA endograft system in
addition to the new Zenith AAA LP as part of its ongoing commitment to improved
patient outcomes by offering products that are best-suited to the individual
needs of every patient. "Compared to previous Cook devices, the Zenith LP
graft's low profile system expands the patient population eligible for
endovascular aneurysm repair, enabling us to treat patients with small access
vessels who might otherwise have to have a conduit procedure for endovascular
access. The stent system features barbs, a suprarenal stent, and provides
excellent deployment accuracy. Zenith LP's 16 Fr system gives us more
reassurance for doing percutaneous endovascular aneurysm repair as well," said
Cherrie Abraham, MD, vascular and endovascular surgeon with Jewish General
Hospital and McGill University (Montreal).

Cook's new Zenith AAA LP device has a significantly smaller profile than Cook's
other EVAR delivery systems, which measure 20-24 French. The newly engineered
stent-graft is based on Cook Medical's ARC Technology, which combines a series
of barbs that engage the aortic wall to provide active fixation, radial force
from self-expanding z-stents for stability and optimal graft-to-vessel
apposition, and a long main body with columnar strength.

The Zenith AAA Low Profile AAA Graft is an investigational device not approved
for sale in the U.S.

ETView looks for U.S. launch of Viva EB

ETView (Tel Aviv, Israel) has completed filing of an FDA premarket approval
application. The company expects feedback from the FDA during the next quarter
and anticipates entering the U.S. market with the Viva EB during 2012.
Additional pre-market regulatory filings in Europe and Asia are anticipated
during 2012.

Viva EB consists of a sterile, single-use, steerable, balloon tipped catheter
which is guided under video imaging to a selected bronchial segment to affect
balloon blockage of the distal airway. Air is subsequently evacuated through a
dedicated channel, deflating the selected lung and establishing lung isolation.
Viva EB is used with an endotracheal tube when used in combination with a
fiberoptic bronchoscope to blockade the right or left lung for thoracic surgical
procedures requiring lung isolation. Viva EB is compatible with ETView's
patented VivaSight SL, a single-use disposable single lumen ventilation tube
with an integrated continuous high resolution video imaging system for use in
lung isolation procedures. VivaSight SL has been cleared for commercial
distribution by the FDA. Lung isolation is employed to provide one-lung
ventilation in patients undergoing thoracic, cardiac, vascular or esophageal
surgeries. It is estimated that more than 1.9 million lung isolation procedures
are conducted world-wide annually, accounting for more than $250 million in
single-use medical disposables.

Baxano gets Canadian approval for iO-Flex

Baxano (San Jose,California), a maker of the iO-Flex system for spinal
decompression surgery, has received a medical device license from Health Canada
permitting the company to promote its iO-Flex technology throughout Canada.

Baxano's iO-Flex system is the first minimally invasive set of flexible
instruments designed to target lumbar stenosis in the central canal, lateral
recess, and neural foramen with minimal disruption to the patient's healthy
anatomy critical for maintaining spinal stability. It is the only treatment
alternative that is able to reach and remove tissue that creates pressure on
multiple nerve roots through a single laminotomy, the company said.

"The Canadian marketplace offers Baxano an excellent opportunity to expand the
presence of our iO-Flex System to patients suffering from the painful effects of
lumbar spinal stenosis," said Tony Recupero, president/VEO of Baxano. "We
believe that the iO-Flex technology has the potential to revolutionize the care
of patients with stenosis. Preliminary data from our post market studies,
suggest that the iO-Flex System may help reduce the overall health costs
associated with the treatment of patients with lumbar spinal stenosis. It's
gratifying to now be able to offer this less-invasive solution for lumbar
stenosis to spine surgeons and their patients in Canada."

Decompression surgery is a common procedure used to treat lumbar spinal stenosis
by cutting away overgrown bone and tissue causing pressure on the spinal nerves.
Almost 325,000 surgical procedures involving decompression to treat lumbar
stenosis are performed each year in the U.S. The arrival of the iO-Flex system
introduces a less-invasive, surgeon- and patient-friendly alternative.

Dickinson man files suit over tissue infection

LENGTH: 248 words


DICKINSON (AP) -- A Dickinson man is suing a Texas blood and tissue organization
for providing him with a tissue graft that allegedly gave him an E. coli
bacteria infection. Michael Beaudoin underwent surgery to his right knee at St.
Joseph's Hospital and Health Center here in August 2000. Tendon tissue graft
material was supplied by the South Texas Blood & Tissue Center in San Antonio,
according to Beaudoin's Southwest District Court lawsuit. Carmen Davila, a
spokeswoman for the South Texas Blood & Tissue Center, said she could not
comment because a lawsuit was pending. The Dickinson hospital is not a part of
the lawsuit. "It's a very unusual infection in a surgery site," said Robert King
Jr., Beaudoin's Minneapolis attorney. The tissue graft came from a donor, he
said. E. coli bacteria cases most often affect a victim's stomach or intestines.
E. coli typically is food-borne. Beaudoin's lawsuit alleges the Texas center was
negligent. According to court documents, Beaudoin sustained permanent injuries
and a loss of income as the result of the graft tissue. Beaudoin is seeking more
than $50,000.

Tribal council appeals ruling BELCOURT (AP) -- The Turtle Mountain Band of
Chippewa's Tribal Council is appealing a judge's ruling that felons should be
eligible to run for the council or the job of tribal chairman. Lynn Boughey, an
attorney for the council and the tribe's elections board, filed the appeal
Thursday. He said an appeals court may hear the dispute later this month.

Texas: Regenerating bone to anchor dental implants

LENGTH: 628  words

DATELINE: Austin


Texas A&M University, The State of Texas has issued the following news release:

For patients who need dental implants, the process can seem especially daunting
if they also need additional bone to support them. Previously this meant a
separate surgery to acquire this bone through a graft from the patient's jaw or
hip and reposition it at the implant site.

Thanks to a clinical inspiration by Dr. Marianela Gonzalez, assistant professor
of oral and maxillofacial surgery at Texas A&M University Baylor College of
Dentistry, patients now have an alternative.

The award-winning treatment idea was sparked through caring for a patient who
had lower teeth so loose that extraction was required. Localized bone loss was
to blame, and Gonzalez knew that to prepare the patient to receive dental
implants, she would need to recreate ample bone to provide a firm anchor.

"For an outcome that works with implants, you need plenty of three-dimensional
volume with the new bone," Gonzalez says. "The problem with the previous bone
graft method is that it tends to add only width but not height to the bone and
fails more than half the time."

Gonzalez conceived a new use for a product called Sonic Weld membrane as a
potential solution. This resorbable material originally was used by surgeons to
repair cranial fractures in children who, because of future bone growth, needed
something less permanent than titanium plates for fracture repair. Sonic Weld
also had manufacturer-suggested uses inside the mouth, but none leading to the
results Gonzalez desired. She had another idea.

Gonzalez attaches the membrane over the top of the gums to create a pocket of
space over the area where bone is needed. She then fills the space with Infuse
Bone Graft, a protein that binds with existing bone cells and attracts the cells
to create bone. Because it can be reabsorbed into the tissue, Sonic Weld is an
enticing alternative to methods that use titanium mesh, which require bone
grafts and secondary surgeries to remove.

"By using SonicWeld membrane with the Infuse Bone Graft to create bone growth,
we got excellent results, and we ultimately placed implants and crowns,"
Gonzalez says.

Gonzalez has repeated the technique on several patients, now at varying stages
of the implant process. In all cases, she found that within four to six months,
the adaptable membrane filled with the protein formed bone with the desired
height and width to create an environment suitable for implants.

"Not only does this technique give the patient new teeth, we have a better
cosmetic result because it produces extra soft tissue," says Gonzalez. "This
enhances the appearance of the crown attached to the implant because it is
surrounded by natural gum tissue."

Gonzalez and several department faculty members submitted their findings to the
Academy of Osseointegration Case Study Poster Competition in March, which occurs
during the annual meeting of this international association for dental implant
professionals. They won first place among 225 submitted posters.

The team followed up with a presentation in April to the American College of
Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons, and a manuscript will be submitted for
publication. Gonzalez reports the new procedure has been met with much interest
from professional colleagues.

"It's exciting because patients can finally have an alternative," Gonzalez says.
"Instead of going to the operating room and taking bone from the jaw or hip, we
can recreate bone and be able to place implants, and patients can look natural
and have complete function.

"We have a four-year follow up on the first patient treated with this procedure,
and he is doing great in terms of bone, implants and crown stability."

American Heart Association: 'Off-the-Shelf' Artificial Blood Vessels May Reduce
Dialysis Complications

LENGTH: 396  words


New Delhi, April 26 -- "Off-the-shelf" blood vessels could one day reduce some
complications of dialysis treatment, according to preliminary research presented
at the American Heart Association's Emerging Science Series Webinar.



Scientists bioengineered an artificial blood vessel by seeding human aorta cells
onto a biodegradable mesh tube. In the process, a tubular vein develops in two
months as the growing cells secrete proteins and the mesh support structure
dissolves. The new vessel is then prepped in a way that minimizes chances of an
immune reaction in the recipient.

In the study, bioengineered vessels implanted in primates for six months
remained durable and didn't have the common complications of synthetic grafts:
blood clots, rejection and thickening of the adjacent vein that can obstruct the
graft.

"Eventually, off-the-shelf blood vessel grafts might be used in kidney dialysis
patients and potentially in many vascular procedures, such as bypassing blocked
arteries in the legs, repairing vessel damage after trauma, or in coronary
bypass operations," said Shannon L. Dahl, Ph.D., lead author of the study and
co-founder and vice president of scientific operations at Humacyte, Inc. in
Research Triangle Park, N.C.

When dialysis is needed because of kidney failure, the first-line approach is to
surgically create an artificial connection (fistula) between an artery and vein
in the arm. But, about half of kidney patients don't have healthy veins, so a
synthetic vessel made of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is used instead.

Synthetic grafts are subject to many complications and about half fail within a
year, said Dahl, requiring replacement surgery.

"The artificial vessels had excellent resistance to obstruction and clotting and
tolerated the repeated needle punctures required for dialysis," Dahl said.

Based on these results researchers have launched a multi-center European
clinical trial, and the FDA has authorized a multi-center U.S. clinical trial,
to assess safety and function of biological grafts in dialysis patients who
can't have a fistula created.

Lab-grown blood vessels help hemodialysis patients

LENGTH: 866 words

Medical Device Daily Senior Staff Writer

To a layperson, the idea of growing human blood vessels in a lab and then
implanting them into human patients for things like hemodialysis access, lower
limb bypass, coronary bypass, and congenital defect repair in children almost
sounds like the basis of a science fiction novel with a futuristic setting. But
to the biomaterials company that has developed this new regenerative medicine
approach, these lab-grown vessels are real, and the company has been attracting
a fire storm of media attention lately because of it.

Cytograft (Novato, California) recently presented this new approach, dubbed
Tissue Engineering by Self-Assembly (TESA), at the American Heart Association's
(AHA; Dallas) Emerging Science series. During a conversation this week with
Medical Device Daily, CEO Todd McAllister, PhD, said the TESA process allows
Cytograft to produce cell-synthesized sheets and threads without the inclusion
of synthetic materials or exogenous scaffolds. The sheets and threads are basic
building blocks that can be woven, stacked, or molded to form more complex
tissues for a variety of repair processes, he said. The company's lead product,
and the subject of the AHA presentation, is a vascular graft targeted at
hemodialysis access, lower limb bypass, coronary bypass, and congenital defect
repair in children. The AHA presentation was based on the world's first clinical
implant of a lab grown vessel built from a master cell line.

The company's technology has recently attracted coverage from CNN, the Wall
Street Journal, Bloomberg, and US News & World Report.

MDD first took notice of Cytograft in 2009 when the company reported development
of this new way of growing blood vessels using a patient's own skin cells to
seed the growth of the tissue (MDD, April 28, 2009). At that time, Cytograft
said it had recruited 10 patients with end-stage kidney disease who had been
having dialysis through an access graft nearing failure and had experienced at
least one access failure already. Five patients had grafts functioning for
hemodialysis six to 20 months after implantation, the company noted at that
time. The vessels were made from two types of cells from each patient:
fibroblasts for scaffolding and endothelial cells for making the lining of the
blood vessel tissue.

Cytograft decided to first target hemodialysis access with its technology
because the average graft survival for hemodialysis patients is around a year to
18 months, McAllister said. He added that roughly 400,000 patients depend on a
hemodialysis shunt and the failure rate is high. "About 7% of Medicare's entire
budget goes towards end-stage renal disease . . . of the 7% about 20% goes to
creating or maintaining these grafts," he said. Most of those patients receive
between one and three interventions a year to maintain the patency of the graft
for hemodialysis and each of those interventions run between $8,000 and $10,000,
McAllister said.

"So there are a lot of patients, it's extraordinarily expensive, and of course
if you are that unfortunate patient [on hemodialysis] it is a terribly
debilitating disease to be living with," McAllister told MDD.

This allogeneic platform makes Cytograft's product available to a broad spectrum
of patients in a clinically and commercially feasible model, McAllister said.
Beyond this lead product (called Lifeline), he says the company is actively
working on a cardiovascular product pipeline which includes stent grafts
(Lifejacket), heart valves, peripheral valves for venous insufficiency, and
patches (Lifeguard) for myocardial regeneration and endarterectomy repair.

What sets Cytograft apart from other biomedical companies is that it has taken
its time getting to where it is today, even though the company has been
envisioning this technology all along. "Literally from day one this was our
direction," McAllister said. "Most companies in this space, they really shoot
for the home run ball right out of the gates . . . we said from the beginning we
will prioritize efficacy over absolutely everything."

So instead of enrolling lots of patients right off the bat, Cytograft decided to
take a conservative approach and spend an entire year enrolling its first three
patients and observing them before ramping up enrollment. "Let's face it - this
is a very high risk [procedure], if this graft fails that has a fairly
significant life- if not limb-threatening outcome," McAllister said.

While the company did have to do animal studies for regulatory purposes before
implanting the vessels into humans, McAllister said the definitive experience is
the transition to humans. Right now it has been about nine months since the
company implanted its first patient with the allogeneic bioengineered graft, he
said.

Beyond the cardiovascular market, there are clear applications for this
technology in neurology and orthopedics McAllister noted. "The advantage in all
of these applications is that our material is derived from human cells and
requires no fixation or chemical modification," he said. "This suggests reduced
inflammation, better remodeling, and less thrombosis."

graft fabrication and application thereof.'

The application for the patent - which was invented by Gabor Forgacs, Stephen H.
Colbert, Bradley A. Hubbard, Francoise Marga and Dustin Christiansen - was
published on Feb. 21 under issue no. 8/2014. According to the abstract released
by the Intellectual Property India: "An engineered three-dimensional structure
includes living cells cohered with each other. The living cells suitably include
Schwann cells and at least one other type of cell. The cells accompanying the
Schwann cells can suitably be bone marrow stem cells or another type of cell
having one or more anti-inflammatory properties. The structure is suitably a
graft that facilitates restorative axon growth when the graft is implanted
between the proximal and distal stubs of a severed nerve in a living organism.
The graft can optionally include a plurality of acellular conduits extending
between opposite axial ends of the graft. Bio-printing techniques can be used to
assemble a three-dimensional construct that becomes through maturation an
axon-guiding graft, by stacking a plurality of multicellular bodies, each of
which includes a plurality of living cells cohered to one another to
sufficiently to avoid collapsing when the multicellular bodies are stacked to
form the structure." The patent application was internationally filed on Feb. 2,
2011 under International application No. PCT/US2011/023520. For any query with

Medtronic settles over 950 Infuse bone graft claims for $22m

SECTION: TREATMENT; Lawsuits

LENGTH: 286 words



HIGHLIGHT: US-based Medtronic has agreed to pay approximately $22m to end
product liability lawsuits involving 950 claimants who used its controversial
Infuse bone graft product, subject to certain conditions.


US-based Medtronic has agreed to pay approximately $22m to end product liability
lawsuits involving 950 claimants who used its controversial Infuse bone graft
product, subject to certain conditions.

Medtronic said this agreement is a compromise of disputed claims and is not in
any way an admission of liability or validity of any defence in the litigation
by the company.

According to Medtronic, the Infuse bone graft is designed to be used in the
treatment of degenerative disc disease in the spine, tibia fractures and dental
procedures.

Medtronic said that it continues to stand behind Infuse bone graft, which has
been used in more than one million patients since it was approved more than ten
years ago.

The company said that a California judge ruled in favour of Medtronic in the
first Infuse bone graft case scheduled to go to trial and it will continue to
vigorously defend the product and company actions in the remaining cases.

The company also noted that around 750 filed cases brought by approximately
1,200 individual plaintiffs remain pending in various US courts, and the
majority of them are still in the early procedural stages.

As previously disclosed in Medtronic's SEC filings, certain law firms
representing an additional 2,600 claimants may file similar claims in the
future.

Medtronic anticipates it will take a special charge of between $120m to $140m in
its recently completed fourth quarter under the guidelines of FAS 5.

This charge represents the latest settlement, estimated settlement of the
approximately 3,800 (1,200 filed; 2,600 unfiled) additional claims, and certain
costs associated with these settlements.

Deals roundup: CryoLife set to pay up to $21.5M to buy Hemosphere

LENGTH: 1286 words

A Medical Device Daily Staff Report

CryoLife (Kennesaw, Georgia), a tissue processing and medical device company
focused on cardiac and vascular surgery, said it has signed a definitive
agreement to acquire Hemosphere (Eden Prairie, Minnesota) for $17 million in
cash, plus potential revenue milestone-based payments of up to $4.5 million.

Hemosphere is a private device company that has developed the HeRO (hemodialysis
reliable outflow) graft for end-stage renal disease hemodialysis patients with
limited access options and central venous obstruction.

CryoLife said it intends to use cash on hand to finance the transaction, which
is expected to close in May. The transaction is subject to customary closing
conditions. Hemosphere's revenues were $5.3 million and gross margins were 65.6%
for the full year 2011.

"The acquisition of Hemosphere significantly advances our strategic initiative
to reposition CryoLife's product portfolio with higher growth, higher margin
medical devices for cardiac and vascular surgery," said Steven Anderson,
president/CEO of CryoLife. "We believe there is a significant opportunity for
our sales team to leverage their strong relationships with vascular surgeons,
many of whom already use our preserved human veins and arteries to provide
arteriovenous (AV) access for ESRD patients, to introduce and to expand
utilization of the HeRO graft in the U.S. In addition, we believe that potential
product enhancements and international sales represent incremental HeRO graft
growth opportunities."

CryoLife noted the following strategic and financial benefits of the
transaction:

o Provides entry into a growing $250+ million worldwide market with a
patent-protected, high margin medical device;

o Leverages CryoLife's 28-person cardiovascular sales team to expand the HeRO
graft's geographical availability and accelerate its growth in the U.S.;

o Adds a product complementary to CryoLife's CryoVein and CryoArtery preserved
human tissues, which are used as an AV graft for ESRD hemodialysis patients;

o Additional growth opportunity for HeRO graft outside of the U.S. through
CryoLife's international direct and distribution sales and marketing
infrastructure;

o Opportunity to use CryoLife's established clinical, regulatory, and R&D teams
to expand HeRO graft product enhancement opportunities.

"The HeRO graft has been clinically proven to reduce bacteremia rates by 69% as
compared to patients with tunneled dialysis catheters," said Patrick Wethington,
president/CEO of Hemosphere. "With over 5,000 HeRO kits sold and nearly 100
clinical publications and presentations, we believe CryoLife's established
corporate infrastructure and resources will be beneficial in expanding patient
access and further enhancing the HeRO graft system."

The HeRO graft received its initial FDA 510(k) clearance in 2008 and CE mark
approval in 2011. It is indicated for catheter dependent ESRD patients on
long-term hemodialysis who have exhausted all other access options, such as AV
fistulas and grafts (AVFs and AVGs).

"The HeRO graft is a unique solution for hemodialysis patients that have blocked
or damaged central veins that require a permanent alternative access," Anderson
said. "Patients benefit from a lower infection rate and enhanced hemodialysis as
compared to TDCs, which cross the skin. Once implanted, the device is easily
accessed similar to conventional grafts. Use of the HeRO graft has been shown to
decrease ancillary procedure costs associated with TDCs and leads to fewer
infections. This is positive for patients, providers and payors, particularly in
light of Medicare's recent adjustment to the dialysis payment system that
bundles the payment for dialysis treatment with payments for drugs and lab
services utilized to diagnose and treat infections. The intention of this
adjustment is to incentivize providers to reduce infections, which are costly to
the healthcare system and can be fatal to patients, and the HeRO graft can
clearly help achieve this goal."

CryoLife anticipates that the transaction will close this month and expects
revenues of between $2.5 million and $3.5 million for the Hemosphere product
line in 2012. The company expects to incur charges in 2012 related to the
acquisition of up to 10 cents a share.

"The addition of the HeRO graft is directly in line with our acquisition
strategy to further leverage our sales and marketing infrastructure and provide
another growth opportunity for our products segment," said D. Ashley Lee,
executive VP, CFO/COO of CryoLife. "In 2012 we will be focused on integrating
the business and collaborating with the Hemosphere team to train our sales reps
on the HeRO graft. While we will benefit from the addition of Hemosphere's
existing business this year, we anticipate that our sales force will begin
driving a meaningful acceleration of HeRO graft growth beginning in 2013."

During a company conference call Tuesday, Anderson told investors and reporters
that CryoLife plans to eventually move Hemosphere's manufacturing to its
Kennesaw, Georgia headquarters.

"Hemosphere was predominately a VC-backed company and we believe their board and
management felt the product would be more successful and have more uptake in the
hands of a larger organization so that was one of the reasons why they looked to
sell the company," Lee told call listeners in response to a question regarding
why Hemosphere was for sale. In response to a question regarding the price of
the acquisition, Lee said that Hemosphere did run a competitive process and that
CryoLife internally developed several models looking at comparable transactions
to arrive at the deal value.

Anderson told call listeners that CryoLife does not have any other acquisitions
on the table at this time, but he said the company "will continue to evaluate
opportunities as they become apparent."

In other dealmaking activity:

o Covidien (Dublin, Ireland), a provider of healthcare products, said it has
completed the previously reported acquisition of superDimension (Minneapolis)
for roughly $300 million, with future earn out payments possible. The deal was
previously reported last month (Medical Device Daily, April 6, 2012).

o National Health Investors (Murfreesboro, Tennessee) said it has exercised an
option to purchase and lease a new, stabilized skilled nursing facility in Texas
for a purchase price of $13.4 million. The facility opened at the end of 2010
with 125 beds and is operated by affiliates of Legend Healthcare. The
transaction is expected to close within the next 30 days and will be funded from
available cash and from borrowings on NHI's revolving credit facility.

o Ohmite Manufacturing (Arlington Heights, Illinois), a provider of resistors
for high current, high voltage and high energy applications, is said that its
corporate parent, Heico (Chicago) has acquired Wakefield Solutions (Pelham, New
Hampshire), a maker of thermal management solutions and aluminum extrusions for
numerous industries.

Heico is an acquisition firm that invests in traditional manufacturing
companies.

o Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, Massachusetts) said it has signed an asset
purchase agreement with Nephromics (Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts), which
includes a patent license for exclusive rights to use PlGF (placental growth
factor) for the diagnosis of pre-eclampsia or eclampsia. Clinical trials have
shown that PlGF supports the diagnosis and risk prediction for preeclampsia
(PE).

Thermo Fisher will develop PlGF as an immunoassay on its own Kryptor platform
and, through management of several sublicenses under the acquired license, will
strengthen its global position in prenatal screening by expanding the
availability of the assay through license partners.

Woodruff Health Sciences Center: Minimally Invasive Heart Surgery -- First
Multicenter Study of Hybrid Revascularization

LENGTH: 815  words


New Delhi, March 11 -- The first multicenter study of hybrid revascularization
shows that the emerging procedure for treating coronary artery disease has a
similar rate of major adverse events in the first year, compared with
percutaneous intervention (stenting).



Hybrid revascularization is a minimally invasive blend of coronary bypass
surgery and stenting. It has been described as a "best of both worlds" strategy
for treating multi-vessel coronary artery disease. Surgeons avoid opening the
patient's sternum, which facilitates recovery, while keeping the durability of
bypass surgery for the most important of the blocked coronary arteries.

John Puskas, MD, professor of surgery and associate chief of cardiothoracic
surgery at Emory University School of Medicine, was national principal
Investigator of the study and presented the results on Sunday at the American
College of Cardiology meeting in San Francisco.

Participating institutions included: Brigham and Women's, Columbia, Duke, Emory,
Lankenau Hospital (Pennsylvania), Montefiore-Einstein Heart Center, Ohio State,
University of Maryland, University of Pennsylvania, University of Virginia and
Vanderbilt. The data coordinating center was housed in the Department of Health
Evidence & Policy at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York.
The study was funded by a Challenge grant (RC1 HL100951) -- part of the 2009
American Recovery & Reinvestment Act -- from the National Institute of Health's
National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), and was conducted in
association with the NHLBI Cardiothoracic Surgery Trials Network.

The prospective cohort study enrolled 200 patients in the hybrid group and 98
who would have been eligible for a hybrid procedure, but had multi-vessel
percutaneous intervention (PCI) instead.

"We started by taking a snapshot of each participating center's catheterization
lab over three months," Puskas says. "That was more than 6,500 patients, but
only a fraction were eligible. They had to have a pattern of coronary artery
disease that could be reasonably treated with either hybrid techniques or
multivessel percutaneous intervention: both an LAD (left anterior descending)
lesion and a significant stenosis in at least one other non-LAD coronary artery.
This was a group of patients with low to medium complexity coronary artery
disease."

The primary measure of safety was the rate of major adverse coronary and
cerebrovascular events (MACCE: includes death, heart attack, stroke or repeat
revascularization procedure). During the first year, hybrid patients had a MACCE
rate of 11 percent (0.143 events per patient-year) while PCI patients had a rate
of 10 percent (0.119 events per patient year), with hybrid revascularization
displaying a trend toward a MACCE rate lower than PCI after the first year.
Patients were followed for up to an average of 17.5 months and during that time,
the MACCE rate for hybrid revascularization patients was 0.868 times that for
PCI patients, adjusted for baseline risk.

"A question this study starts to address is, whether short-term outcomes and
complications over the first year are comparable between these two alternative
therapies," Puskas says. "These results suggest that hybrid revascularization is
as safe in the first year, with a trend to benefit over the longer term. It
would be a challenge to markedly out-perform PCI over the first year. We expect
that, if hybrid revascularization has an advantage, it will come out over the
next few years."

He explains that multivessel coronary bypass surgery usually includes a left
internal mammary artery (LIMA) graft for the blockage in the left anterior
descending coronary artery (LAD), along with veins from the legs for the other
blocked vessel(s). The LIMA graft has several advantages: most importantly, the
LIMA graft stays open longer than vein grafts, because the LIMA is conditioned
to higher blood pressures.

"We know the left internal mammary artery graft is the most durable treatment
for that [LAD] blockage, so we expect there will be fewer repeat
revascularizations in the hybrid group of patients," he says.

Hybrid revascularization keeps the LIMA graft for the LAD while using coronary
stents for other non-LAD blockages, allowing a minimally invasive approach and
avoiding use of the heart-lung machine.

"In light of the growing adoption of this treatment paradigm, a randomized trial
of hybrid revascularization is now needed to rigorously evaluate its safety and
efficacy relative to PCI," says Deborah D. Ascheim, MD, associate professor of
health evidence & policy and cardiology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount
Sinai, and principal investigator of the study's data coordinating center.

Puskas agrees that the results of the current observational study supports
investigators' plans to conduct a randomized trial of hybrid revascularization
in comparison with PCI.

FUNERAL HOME THEFTS;
Body parts may be tainted;
Patients tested as 'ripple of fear' reaches Atlanta

BYLINE: JEFF NESMITH

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 1A

LENGTH: 2152 words


Washington --- Nearly 100 patients who received grafts of human tissue at six
Atlanta-area hospitals in the last two years have been told that the tissue may
be diseased because it came from body parts stolen from funeral home corpses.

The unidentified patients, among thousands in a growing nationwide horror story,
have been advised to undergo testing for HIV/AIDS, syphilis and hepatitis B and
C because the material grafted into them was not properly screened for the
infections. Their surgeries took place at Piedmont Hospital, Northside Hospital,
Emory University Medical Center, Crawford Long Hospital, Gwinnett Medical Center
and DeKalb Medical Center.

"This ghastly conduct has sent a ripple of fear to anyone who has had a medical
implant," said New York City Department of Investigations Commissioner Rose Gill
O'Hearn, whose detectives uncovered the scheme last October in which more than
1,000 corpses were allegedly looted in funeral homes for parts that were sold
into the legitimate and highly lucrative human tissue market.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration says that it and the federal Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention believe the risk for infection is low. Even so,
the FDA recommends that hospitals and physicians who engrafted the suspect
material contact patients around the country and advise them of the need to be
tested. The FDA has also ordered the recall of bone, tendon, skin, heart valves
and other tissues --- known as "allografts" --- distributed by the company at
the center of the alleged multimillion-dollar scheme, Biomedical Tissue Services
of Fort Lee, N.J.

When body parts such as heart valves, skin, bone, tendons and cartilage are
legally taken from corpses, FDA rules require permission from the donor or
relatives. Proper screening and paperwork should block the harvesting of body
parts from unsuitable donors, such as those who were diseased or drug users. In
the case of Biomedical Tissue Services, prosecutors allege that bodies were
looted --- with funeral homes' permission --- without regard for disease or
cause of death and without donors' or their relatives' knowledge or consent.

One saving grace in the sordid case may be that the stolen parts did undergo
routine safety procedures after they were sold for processing and implantation.
Strict processing rules require that each product be treated with anti-viral and
anti-bacterial drugs and subjected to intense radiation before it is surgically
implanted, according to the American Association of Tissue Banks.

"The only good news about this whole episode is the fact that before any of the
tissue could be implanted into a human patient, it had to go through one of our
laboratories," said Robert Rigney, head of the trade group.

Class-action suits filed

That confidence is apparently lost on trial lawyers.

Class-action lawsuits filed in federal courts in several cities suggest the
material spread far from the funeral homes in New York, New Jersey and
Pennsylvania where indictments allege it was harvested. By last week, at least
33 federal suits had been filed around the country and an unknown number of
lawsuits had been filed in state courts. In the rush to participate in what
could be a mammoth class-action lawsuit, some lawyers have advertised on Google
seeking clients. Some firms report having hundreds of plaintiffs.

Most of the cases have been filed on behalf of patients who complain of
suffering "mental anguish" and the pain of worrying that they may develop
disease. At least one plaintiff said she has contracted syphilis and another
said tests showed "evidence of exposure to hepatitis B and hepatitis C."

In suits filed this month, a Shelby County, Ala., woman said she received
suspect bone during lumbar spinal surgery in Birmingham last year after a car
accident. A West Virginia woman and a Pennsylvania man said in separate suits
that they received suspect tissue during emergency hernia surgery --- performed
on both patients on Jan. 1, 2005 --- at a hospital in Knoxville.

Another set of lawsuits has been filed by survivors of those whose bodies were
allegedly dissected without consent. One such suit alleged that a New York woman
whose corpse was dissected had several diseases, including antibiotic-resistant
staphylococcus.

At the center of the criminal and civil cases is the head of Biomedical Tissue
Services, Michael Mastromarino, a former New Jersey dental surgeon whose cocaine
use cost him his license. He and three associates were indicted in February in
connection with the macabre enterprise. In addition to obtaining the parts
without consent, they allegedly forged documents designed to keep diseased
tissues from entering the worldwide tissues market.

Prosecutors say the legitimate laboratories that processed the tissues --- none
of them related to Mastromarino or his enterprise --- include a Kennesaw
nonprofit, Lost Mountain Tissue Bank; LifeCell Corp. of Branchburg, N.J.;
Regeneration Technologies and Tutogen Medical Inc., both of Alachua, Fla.; and
the Blood and Tissue Center of Central Texas in Austin. All are defendants in
the growing list of lawsuits.

The tissue processors received and distributed the body parts nationwide, likely
without knowing any of the tissues had not been properly obtained, screened or
tested. Brooklyn, N.Y., prosecutors examined records of the five companies, none
of which was implicated in the indictments as participants in the alleged
scheme.

Lost Mountain Chief Executive James D. Wade would not comment for this article.
Earlier, he told The Associated Press that his company processed several
thousand pieces of human tissue obtained from Biomedical Tissue Services but
distributed only a few hundred, of which fewer than two dozen were transplanted
into people.

The company has reported to the FDA that the hospitals to which it distributed
the material are located "nationwide and Turkey."

Lost Mountain, which is among the defendants in a number of lawsuits, knows of
two Georgia patients who "may have received implants of tissue that was subject
to the recall," according to company lawyer Martin M. Wilson of Atlanta. Both
patients "have been contacted and neither has reported any problems whatsoever,"
Wilson said in a written statement. He added that a "minuscule number of tissue
allografts" that were recalled have not been returned to Lost Mountain.

Wilson said he believed Lost Mountain was being sued because its name was on the
FDA recall notification list. "We have yet to identify any plaintiff who has
received tissue with which LMTB was even remotely involved," the attorney said.

Lost Mountain has a previous FDA history of tissue-handling concerns, which the
agency says have since been corrected. In 2003, FDA warned Lost Mountain that it
was failing to "prepare, validate, and follow written procedures for prevention
of infectious disease contamination or cross-contamination by tissue during
processing." At the time, the FDA said the Kennesaw firm "routinely reworks
tissue products in order to extend the expiration date" without valid written

Hospitals give notification

The Atlanta-area hospitals involved, in response to inquiries, say 94 patients
have been told they should be tested because grafts they received involved
scavenged body parts. Piedmont has notified 41 patients, Northside 29, Emory
University Medical Center (including Crawford Long Hospital) 10, Gwinnett
Medical Center nine and DeKalb Medical Center five.

Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta Medical Center, St. Joseph's Hospital and the
three Cobb County hospitals managed by Wellstar Health System say none of their
patients received any of the improperly harvested material.

At Gwinnett Medical Center, spokeswoman Paula Martin said identifying the nine
patients who received bone grafts from the FDA recall material "was somewhat
labor intensive" because officials had to study patient charts.

"We notified the patients directly," she said. "If it happened in our hospital,
we took that responsibility, rather than go through the doctors."

Martin said the nine bone grafts could be traced to Regeneration Technologies,
which acquired the material from Biomedical Tissue Services. All the material
had been subjected to a process called "biocleansing" before it was engrafted
and none of the patients has had any problems, she added.

Most of the Atlanta-area hospitals in which patients received Biomedical Tissue
Services parts could not say this week which processors provided them with the
finished product.

Spokesmen for Northside and Piedmont said confidentiality clauses in their
procurement contracts prevented disclosure of suppliers' names. A DeKalb Medical
Center spokeswoman said she could not obtain names of suppliers. An
Emory-Crawford Long spokesman cited a policy against discussing relationships
with vendors.

The potential impact of the implant nightmare is vast.

By October, when the FDA told surgeons to notify their patients to be tested,
1,974 tissue providers registered with the FDA from around the globe listed
Biomedical Tissue Services as a source.

There is no central record of how much of the stolen material was engrafted into
human beings but one processor listed more than 5,000 individual grafts that it
said had been distributed in New Jersey, Florida, Alabama, Texas and Georgia.
One bone can be cut and refigured into many pieces, often to specifically
ordered sizes and shapes, for implantation.

Court records filed by Cleveland lawyer Jack Landskroner on behalf of a woman
who received a spinal implant of suspect tissue show the FDA has a list of about
13,000 "lot numbers" of improperly harvested tissue that was sold to processors.

Each number may represent several different grafts, and lawsuits filed in both
state and federal courts allege that "tens of thousands" of persons could have
been exposed to the questionable material.

Health Canada, the country's national health department, has said that about 300
grafts from the illegal New York collections were used there.

A spokeswoman for Motley Rice of Charleston, S.C., one of the country's largest
plaintiff litigation law firms, said the firm had lined up 283 "potential"
clients from several states.

In Pensacola, Fla., attorney Marcus Michles said he had about 20 clients, all
from the Florida panhandle.

Michles also said that "a block of Pensacola doctors" have declined to notify
patients that they received questionable grafts and implants, reasoning that the
risk was too low to justify the stress that notification would cause the
patients.

Regulation questioned

It is not clear from records how any of the tissue brokers could have known that
the material from New York was illegally harvested or mislabeled. Many lawsuits,
however, accuse processors of recklessly failing to exercise proper diligence.

Atlanta lawyer Don C. Keenan, who was involved in a widely publicized series of
suits against companies in the human tissue market two years ago, said the
industry is poorly regulated --- in contrast to the system in which body organs
such as hearts and kidneys are recovered and preserved for transplant.

"Anybody with a chain saw and a truck can go into this business," Keenan added.

But Rigney, of the American Association of Tissue Banks, disputes that, saying
the industry has been heavily regulated since 1993. His organization is working
to develop additional procedures to detect falsified documents and prevent
recurrence of the New York fiasco.

"We want to protect against this ever happening again," Rigney said. "In the
30-year history of our organization, we've never seen something like this
before."

He said Biomedical Tissue Services was not certified by his organization.

In response to written questions, FDA spokeswoman Julie Zawisza confirmed that
the tissue retrieval operation had passed FDA safety inspections before the
allegedly fraudulent recovery operation came to light.

"The agency had no reason to suspect that the donor eligibility determinations
were not performed according to FDA requirements," she added. "FDA's more recent
inspection of Biomedical Tissue Services [last October] identified deviations
that, because of their serious nature, constituted a danger to public health."

It was then that the FDA ordered Biomedical Tissue Services to cease its
shipments.

Comparing the alleged enterprise to "something out of a cheap horror movie,"
Kings County, N.Y., District Attorney Charles Hynes announced the 122-count
indictments Feb. 23.

Mastromarino and the others harvested parts in a secret room of a New York
funeral home, replacing bones with plastic pipe and repairing incisions so that
the dissections would not be noticed at funerals, the indictments allege.

In some cases, cause of death or age of the person at death were reportedly
altered on paperwork to make the stolen material appear to comply with FDA
regulations.

Graphic: FROM THE DEAD TO THE LIVING How human tissue is harvested and reused. *
When a patient dies or is near death, all hospitals that receive Medicare or
Medicaid reimbursement must notify organ and tissue retrieval agencies. * Organ
donors must be maintained on life support until the organs are removed, but life
support is not required for tissue donors. Tissue must be taken within 15 and 24
hours of death, depending on whether the body was refrigerated. * Medical
records are reviewed. Donors who had cancer, mad cow disease, HIV-AIDS, syphilis
or hepatitis B or C are disqualified. * Relatives are consulted, and donor's
wishes are determined from donor cards or driver's licenses. Consent must be
obtained and documented. * Bodies are examined and tested for disease. *
Retrieval must take place under aseptic conditions in a hospital or funeral home
by personnel wearing gowns and gloves. * Parts are distributed (usually sold) to
tissue banks to be processed. * The parts are usually cut into multiple grafts
and given trace numbers before they are further sold to hospitals for grafting
or transplant. Tissue banks must ensure that parts are sold with medical and
compliance records and death certificates. * Tissue bank physicians must review
and oversee further tests for diseases. * Finally, all grafts must be treated
with antibacterial and antiviral drugs, subjected to high-dose radiation and
tested again. -----FACTS ABOUT GRAFTS Grafts of human tissue have saved the
lives of thousands of people and made it possible for millions more to recover
from chronic conditions, according to Robert Rigney, head of the American
Association of Tissue Banks. Each year in the U.S.: * Nearly 2 million tissue
grafts are performed. Skin, bone, tendon, arteries, veins and other tissue are
recovered from the bodies of 25,000 donors. These include 3,500 heart valves,
1,500 vein and artery grafts and 1.5 million muscoskeletal grafts of bone and
tendon. * More than 19,000 square feet of human skin is retrieved, primarily for
burn victims. * More than 550,000 corneal eye transplants have been performed
since 1961. Unlike organs, which are retrieved and allocated to recipients under
a national network regulated by the federal Health Resources and Services
Administration, tissue grafts are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration.

o Aastrom Biosciences (Ann Arbor, Michigan), said it would initiate a human
clinical trial for the evaluation of the company's Tissue Repair Cell (TRC)
product to form new bone tissue in the spine. The Phase I/II trial will be
conducted under an investigational new drug application approved by the FDA, and
initially conducted at a single clinical center, William Beaumont Hospital
(Royal Oak, Michigan). TRCs, a bone marrow-derived adult stem cell product, will
be used in posterior-lateral lumbar spinal fusions for treatment of degenerative
spondylolisthesis. This is the company's second FDA-approved human clinical
trial for local bone regeneration using TRCs.

o ART Advanced Research Technologies (Saint-Laurent, Quebec) said Central
Alberta Medical Imaging Services (CAMIS; Red Lodge, Alberta) has joined in the
North American pivotal study for the company's SoftScan optical breast imaging
system. SoftScan has been designed as a complementary diagnostic tool to
mammography. CAMIS is joining such centers such as the Cedars Breast Clinic of
McGill University Health Center and the Centre Hospitalier de l'Universite de
Montreal (both Montreal) and Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston) in the
study, which represents the final stage prior to commercializing SoftScan. ART
said it intends to present results of the study, which will include between 600
and 950 women, in its submission to Health Canada and the FDA. The company is
commercializing its products in a global strategic alliance with GE Healthcare
(Waukesha, Wisconsin).

o Avitar (Canton, Massachusetts) has introduced ORALscreenLAB, a comprehensive
array of laboratory-based oral fluid drug screens. Peter Phildius, chairman and
CEO, said, "Random drug screening is an extremely effective deterrent to drug
abuse; [but] traditional urine testing is not well suited for random screening
in the corporate sector. Oral fluid-based testing is an enabling technology that
provides corporations with a key component in establishing an effective
drug-free workplace program."

o Osteotech (Eatontown, New Jersey) said the FDA has cleared its 510(k)
application for Grafton Plus DBM Paste for use as a bone graft extender, bone
graft substitute and bone void filler in orthopedic procedures. Sam Owusu-Akyaw,
president and chief operating officer, said the 510(k) for orthopedic use is the
first of five 510(k) applications the company has filed with the FDA covering
its family of Grafton DBM products. "To our knowledge," he said, "this is the
only DBM product on the market to receive clearance as a bone graft extender,
bone graft substitute and bone void filler." Grafton Plus DBM Paste is a
demineralized bone product that is osteoinductive and has been validated to
inactivate a panel of viruses, including HIV-1, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, CMV
and polio.

First surgery conducted with Aurora Spine's Zip Graft bone dowel in US

SECTION: ORTHOPEDIC DEVICES; Product Developments

LENGTH: 117 words



HIGHLIGHT: Aurora Spine, a US-based orthopaedic implant company said that first
surgery using its Zip Graft pre-packaged sterile bone dowel was carried out at
the Madison County Hospital in London, Ohio.


Aurora Spine East sales vice president Doug Johnson said: "We are very excited
to see the Zip Graft used in conjunction with the Zip MIS fusion device.

"The allograft bone dowels are designed and sized to fit into our devices thus
creating an integrated fit every time."

Zip Graft is a cancellous allograft designed specifically to fit into the Zip
MIS interspinous fusion system. The bone dowel, which is gamma irradiated and
packaged sterile for immediate use, is available in various sizes.

The company said that ZIP Graft, which is originally released in Europe as a
pre-packaged sterile synthetic bone dowel composed of tri-calcium phosphate,
will also be continuously commercialized throughout Europe.

Head Line: US Patent granted to COOK MEDICAL TECHNOLOGIES LLC on November 29,
2016 titled as "Stent delivery system with nitinol trigger wire"

LENGTH: 186 words

DATELINE: New York


ALEXANDRIA, Va: United States Patent and Trademark Office has granted patent no.
9,504,589 on November 29, 2016, to COOK MEDICAL TECHNOLOGIES LLC titled as
"Stent delivery system with nitinol trigger wire"

Inventors: Hartley; David Ernest (Wannanup, AU), Schaeffer; Darin G.
(Bloomington, IN)


Assignee: COOK MEDICAL TECHNOLOGIES LLC (Bloomington, IN)

According to the abstract released by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office: "A
stent graft delivery system (50) has a stent graft (74) retained on it. The
stent graft has an exposed proximally extending self expanding stent (76) which
is retained in a distally opening capsule (78) at the distal end of a nose cone
dilator (58) on the delivery system. A trigger wire (80) extends from a release
mechanism (82) the distal end of the delivery system into a first aperture (84)
in the capsule, around a proximal bend (86) of the exposed stent and out of the
first aperture in the capsule and extending proximally into a second aperture
(88). The trigger wire prevents premature release of the exposed stent."

The patent was filed on October 27, 2010 Application No. 13/504,588

Mower accident victim soon to leave hospital

After seven surgeries, 2-year-old Ireland Nugent is scheduled to leave Tampa
General Hospital three weeks after her feet were severed in a lawn mower
accident.

"It looks like she is going home this weekend," according to a Facebook page
hosted by her family's church and pastor.

Ireland's father accidentally backed a riding lawn mower over her on April 11 at
their Palm Harbor home.

A skin graft on her right leg in April wasn't successful, so doctors had to
remove inflamed tissue and create new grafts. On Thursday, doctors determined
the new grafts looked good.

Donations to help Ireland and the family, or cards of encouragement, are being
handled by their church. Checks to the Ireland Nugent Fund can be sent to
Trinity Presbyterian Church, 2001 Rainbow Drive, Clearwater, 33765. Or donors
can go to the church's site and contribute by credit card:

Hillsborough director of Head Start resigns

Hillsborough County officials announced late Friday that the head of the
county's Head Start program had resigned.

The short news release, which the county sent out shortly after 5 p.m., says
Louis Finney Jr. had resigned, effective immediately, and that he would "be
pursuing another career opportunity."

Finney has been the Head Start director for the past eight years. He could not
be reached for comment Friday.

Polo mogul to get new manslaughter trial

WEST PALM BEACH A South Florida polo mogul has won a new trial in his driving
under the influence manslaughter case.

A Palm Beach County judge ruled Friday that one of the jurors who convicted John
Goodman in March 2012 made a fair trial impossible.

The Palm Beach Post reports that Circuit Judge Jeffrey Colbath vacated Goodman's
conviction and 16-year-sentence. Colbath's written opinion cites juror Dennis
DeMartin's misconduct in a drinking experiment and allegations that he withheld
key facts about his past during jury selection.

Police say Goodman ran a stop sign in February 2010 and struck Scott Patrick
Wilson's car, which rolled into a canal, where the young man died. Authorities
say Goodman left the scene and waited nearly an hour to call 911. His blood
alcohol level measured more than twice the legal limit for driving.

Goodman is the founder and owner of the International Polo Club.

Death warrant signed for prison guard killer

TALLAHASSEE Gov. Rick Scott has signed a death warrant for a man convicted in
the death of a prison guard.

The governor's office announced Friday that 58-year-old William Van Poyck is
scheduled to die by lethal injection at Florida State Prison near Raiford at 6
p.m. June 12.

In June 1987, Van Poyck and co-defendant Frank Valdes ambushed two guards who
were taking inmate James O'Brien in a prison van to a doctor's office in West
Palm Beach. Corrections officer Fred Griffis died after being shot three times.
Van Poyck and Valdes were unable to free O'Brien and were arrested a short time
later when Valdes lost control of the Cadillac he was driving and struck a tree.

In 2003, Van Poyck wrote an autobiography, "A Checkered Past: A Memoir." The
book details a downward spiral that began as a child burglar and ended with his
condemnation for the murder.

Several guards at Florida State Prison were arrested and charged with stomping
Valdes to death in 1999, but no one was convicted in two trials. Prison
officials then sent Van Poyck to Sussex State Prison in Virginia for his
protection.

Crocodile relocated after laying eggs

ISLAMORADA The relocation of a crocodile that laid eggs in a Florida Keys front
yard reflects a shift in policy regarding the threatened reptiles.

The crocodile was moved from a Lower Matecumbe Key neighborhood last week to
bayside waters about 4 miles away, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife
Conservation Commission.

The agency will watch over roughly two dozen eggs that were removed from the
nest in a garden.

State wildlife officials previously avoided relocating crocodiles because the
animals are territorial and tend to return to their stomping grounds.

The Johns Hopkins University: Customized Device Tailored to Patient's Individual
Anatomy Now Used to Repair Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Without Surgery

LENGTH: 821  words


New Delhi, Feb. 15 -- Johns Hopkins is one of the first hospitals in the United
States to offer the customized graft.

An abdominal aortic aneurysm - a bulge in the large artery that carries blood
away from the heart - can be immediately life-threatening if it grows large
enough to rupture. The chance of survival when it ruptures is less than 10
percent.



Many people who find out they have that risk are able to have a minimally
invasive repair. But up to 30 percent instead face a major open surgery with a
long recovery because of the location of the aneurysm. Now a new graft
customized to their individual anatomy allows them, too, to have a quick
recovery. The Johns Hopkins Hospital is one of the first hospitals in the United
States now offering the procedure.

Ronald Rolett, a retired physician from North Carolina, learned that he had an
abdominal aortic aneurysm four years ago from a routine ultrasound screening. He
then had follow-up ultrasound tests every six months and the bulge continued to
grow. In September 2012, it had reached a critical size: 5.9 centimeters, and he
says, "That was the alarm bell. I decided that something had to be done."

On January 11, 2013, Rolett became the first patient at The Johns Hopkins
Hospital - and at any hospital in the mid-Atlantic region - to have an aneurysm
repaired in a minimally invasive way using a graft that was made to fit his
specific anatomy. Because of the location of his aneurysm, without that
customized graft, he would have needed a much more extensive, open surgery with
a long recovery. He also faced a greater risk of kidney failure with an open
operation since his kidney function was abnormal.

There are two methods to repair an abdominal aortic aneurysm to prevent it from
rupturing:

* The traditional "open" surgery approach that requires several months to
recover.

* An endovascular repair - a minimally invasive procedure that has become more
common in recent years. Doctors attach a synthetic graft to a catheter and then
feed it through an artery in the groin to the damaged section of aorta to
prevent the vessel from rupturing. The grafts commonly used today come in
different sizes and are pulled off the shelf.

Previously, many of those people who were fortunate enough to have their
aneurysm identified prior to rupture could not have the endovascular repair
because their aneurysm was located too close to the renal arteries. For them,
the only option has been open surgery, which carries higher risk of heart attack
and kidney failure.

"We need at least 5 millimeters to 10 millimeters of length between the renal
arteries and the aneurysm in order to secure the stent-graft in place in most
patients," says Johns Hopkins vascular surgeon James Black.

Only a few dozen surgeons nationwide, including Black, have been trained to
repair abdominal aortic aneurysms with a new type of graft that was FDA-approved
in April 2012. Johns Hopkins is one of a select group of hospitals in the United
States now offering this new approach to patients.

The new graft looks similar to the traditional endovascular graft made of a
polyester fabric encased by a stainless steel scaffold. However, it is different
from the off-the-shelf graft because of fenestrations - two tiny holes
fabricated in the graft to accommodate the renal arteries, helping to keep the
graft in place, as well as a scallop-shaped cut to supply blood to the superior
mesenteric artery, which carries blood to the intestines.

"We do a substantial amount of planning before the endovascular operation to
ensure that the graft will be engineered correctly to match the patient's
individual anatomy," says Black. "The planning process includes making a 3-D
image and model of the patient's aorta using computed tomography (CT)."

The fabrication of each graft takes about five weeks, but for patients it's
worth the wait to have a less invasive repair. They can go home from the
hospital three days later and get back to their normal activities in two weeks
compared with a four- to eight-week recovery following open surgery. Patients
have a CT scan one to two months after the procedure and then are followed
annually.

Patients who are eligible for the new customized graft repair include those
whose aneurysms approach within 5 millimeters of the renal arteries and have
large enough vessels to deliver the stent-graft to the appropriate location.

"At Hopkins, we perform close to 100 open abdominal aortic aneurysm repairs each
year for patients who are not eligible for the minimally invasive option," says
Black. "With the new fenestrated stent-graft, we will be able to spare many of
those patients a big operation and a long recovery."

Rolett is pleased that he was able to have his abdominal aortic aneurysm
repaired in the minimally invasive way. "I spent three nights in the hospital,
and after two weeks, I no longer had any discomfort and was able to get back to
my normal activities."

Kips Bay implants first US patient in eSVS Mesh trial

SECTION: WATER & WASTE WATER MANAGEMENT; Technology

LENGTH: 247 words



HIGHLIGHT: US-based medical device company Kips Bay Medical has implanted the
first US patient in a multi-centre, randomised clinical study of its eSVS Mesh.


US-based medical device company Kips Bay Medical has implanted the first US
patient in a multi-centre, randomised clinical study of its eSVS Mesh.

The extravascular nitinol (nickel titanium alloy) prosthesis, which was
implanted at Northeast Georgia Heart Centre in Gainesville, Georgia, US, is used
as an external saphenous vein graft (SVG) support device while performing
coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery in patients with atherosclerotic
disease.

Northeast Georgia Heart Centre minimally invasive valve reconstructions surgeon
Dr Alan Wolfe said that in patients with atherosclerotic disease, the most
significant problem is bypass graft closure.

"The eSVS Mesh device is designed to prevent saphenous vein grafts from
closing," Wolfe said.

The eSVS MESH improves the structural characteristics and long-term performance
of the graft, when placed on the outside of the SVG during CABG surgery,
according to the company.

The feasibility trial, eMESH I, will enrol up to 120 patients from eight
European and four US sites to assess the initial safety and performance of the
eSVS Mesh for supporting external SVG.

The company said it will use the study data to submit an investigational device
exemption application seeking approval from the US Food and Drug Administration
to perform a pivotal trial in the US.

Kips Bay provides therapeutic vascular technologies to better treat
cardiovascular diseases, and develops new solutions to advance, refine and
improve cardiac surgery.

Medtronic shopping spree continues

BYLINE: JOE CARLSON; STAFF WRITER, STAR TRIBUNE (Mpls.-St. Paul)

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. 1D

LENGTH: 533 words



HIGHLIGHT: Latest acquisition is a California firm that makes devices that
secure grafts inside the aorta.


In its latest corporate acquisition, the Minnesota-run medical devicemaker
Medtronic PLC announced it has paid $110 million for a California company whose
products secure artificial patches inside weakened aortic arteries.

Aptus Endosystems of Sunnyvale, Calif., makes a system that inserts tiny screws
to anchor a tube-shaped graft implant that lines the inside of a weakened aorta,
which is the body's main artery moving blood from the heart. Endosystems'
anchors can be used to secure endograft implants made by Medtronic and other
companies.

"Medtronic's acquisition of the Aptus technology is validation of our mission to
bring a durable solution to patients with challenging anatomies," Aptus CEO
James Reinstein said in a news release about the deal.

About 1.5 million Americans have a condition known as an abdominal aortic
aneurysm, which is a weakened section of the aorta that may rupture unexpectedly
and cause internal bleeding in some patients.

For aortic aneurysms that need surgical treatment, one approach is to guide a
minimally invasive tube through a leg incision to the site of the aneurysm and
then deploy a fabric-and-metal liner that directs the blood and prevents
pressure from pushing out on the weakened area.

But such grafts don't always fit perfectly in everyone's anatomy. Aptus' systems
can be used to anchor the liner and prevent leakage, especially in patients who
have problems with an existing endograft seal or those who have risk factors
that would make it dangerous to do a revision procedure if the initial seal
doesn't work.

The Aptus Heli-FX EndoAnchor system can be used to anchor abdominal aortic
endograft sheaths, while the Heli-FX Thoracic system can be used in repairs
higher up in the chest. The systems are compatible with Medtronic's Endurant and
Valiant graft systems, as well as systems made by two other companies, a video
on Aptus' website says.

"We are excited to add this unique complementary anchor technology to our aortic
portfolio," Medtronic aortic general manager Daveen Chopra said in a statement.
The devices "strongly align with our strategy to invest in treatments that
address complex aortic disease with a vision to treat disease of the entire
aorta."

Medtronic has bought several companies since late January, when it competed a
$49.9 billion deal to

acquire hospital supplier Covidien and move its combined corporate headquarters
to low-tax Ireland while keeping executives' offices in Fridley. Medtronic
officials said the offshore tax structure would allow more flexibility to
allocate company cash, some of which would be used in strategic deals to expand
the company's product offerings.

Last week, the newly expanded Medtronic announced the acquisition of
CardioInsight Technologies of Cleveland in a deal valued at $93 million, and in
April it paid an undisclosed sum for Dutch diabetes clinic Diabeter. In March,
it announced a deal for Colorado's Sophono, and in February it revealed plans to
buy Tennessee-based Advanced Uro-Solutions.

The company last week also said it would buy back another 80 million shares of
its stock and increase its quarterly dividend by 25 percent, to 38 cents.

New protein allows mice to accept transplants

SOURCE: FROM ASSOCIATED PRESS

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A4

LENGTH: 293 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON


Tests show that a new protein can trick the mouse immune system into accepting,
instead of attacking, transplanted tissue. Experts say the discovery may lead to
organ transplants without a lifetime of anti-rejection drugs.

Jeffrey Bluestone, leader of a research team at the University of Chicago
Medical Centre, said the protein blocks a key signal that immune cells in the
blood, called T-cells, must receive before they attack transplanted tissue.
Without the signal, an organ transplant is tolerated by the body, he said.

While the new protein can ease the body's acceptance of transplanted tissue, the
rest of the immune system is left intact and able to fight off germs and
diseases.

A report on the study is to be published today in the journal Science.

In the Chicago study, a group of diabetic mice received transplants of human
pancreatic tissue. Half of the mice also were treated over a 14-day period with
injections of a genetically-engineered protein.

The mice that did not receive the protein shots rejected the tissue transplants
and the grafts died within a week. Grafts in the mice that did receive the
shots, however, survived and, in most cases, showed no sign of being rejected by
the mouse immune system.

Mr. Bluestone reported that the grafts also produced insulin, thus correcting
the mouse diabetes.

"We kept some mice with grafts for well over 100 days," said Mr. Bluestone.
"That means that the graft is tolerant (accepted by the body)."

Dr. J. Richard Thistlethwaite, chief of transplantation services at the
University of Chicago Medical Centre and a co-author with Mr. Bluestone, said if
the technique can be perfected for human use "we will have solved the major
problem facing organ transplantation today."

High school football: Snow Canyon Warriors 2011 preview

BYLINE: James Edward Deseret News

LENGTH: 659 words


NOTE: Snow Canyon finished with an 3-6 overall record in 2010 and a 3-3 record
in the combined Region 9. It did not qualify for the playoffs. ST. GEORGE ? It's
been five years since powerful running back Adam Timo burst onto the scene and
led Snow Canyon to a 3A runner-up finish.

The Warriors haven't been back to the state playoffs since. In fact, they
haven't had a winning record in past three years either. Jay Graft, who's been
at the helm the past two seasons, is doing everything he can to reverse the
trend and get Snow Canyon back on the map as a contender in Southern Utah. He
said it's not easy these days when kids have so many different activities to
choose from. "I think it's all in attitude. Kids these days, there are so many
things they can go do," said Graft. "Sometimes you don't get quite the focus and
quite the commitment because they are doing other things. That's the biggest
thing we've got to overcome is being committed to what we're doing and then
committed to working hard and getting better at it." With minimal returning
starters, Snow Canyon will have its hands full in the very competitive Region 9.
"Our goal has just been to get better every week. Everybody has to grow up,
that's the main thing. They've got to start maturing and acting like varsity
players and not like sophomore players anymore," said Graft. A year after mixed
results using the spread offense, Snow Canyon is reverting back to an
I-formation approach. Graft said he'll still sprinkle a little spread into the
playbook, but he just doesn't' think he has the personnel to be successful with
the spread this year. The offensive switch will allow running backs like Taylor
Johansen and Mitch Phillips to put a bigger stamp on games this year.
Quarterback Brayden Linde won't be asked to do as much, either, because of the
new offense. Graft is optimistic that if things continue to come together and
his players pick up the new offense, Snow Canyon has what it takes to get back
to the playoffs. Snow Canyon Warriors at a glance Coach: This is Jay Graft's
third year in his second stint as Snow Canyon's head coach. Last year he
finished with a 3-6 record, and his overall head coaching record in six seasons
is 30-29. He is a graduate of Woodridge High in Virginia. Offense (3 returning
starters; I-back) A year after averaging just 18.4 points per game, Snow Canyon
is ditching the spread offense for a more traditional approach. Linde is a
returning starter at quarterback and he'll have some familiar faces on the line
with the return of Benjamin Gottfredson and Tavish Nelson. Connor Livingston,
Cooper Robinson, Johansen and Phillips are all skill-position players who could
make nice contributions.  Defense (3 returning starters) After starting last
season 0-3, Snow Canyon's defense got better as the year wore on ? a trend it
hopes to continue this year. Curtis Bulloch and Trevor Nelson will anchor things
defensively at linebacker, while Gottfredson will also start at defensive end.
The Warriors should get a boost as well with the return of a healthy Dillon
Cook. A concussion sidelined him for most of his sophomore season, but Graft
said he's probably the best tackler on the team.  Coaches preseason Region 9
straw poll: Fifth Deseret News Region 9 prediction: Sixth Bottom line: The
offense definitely needing tweaking, but Snow Canyon will likely struggle as a
result early this season. How quickly it figures things out will determine
whether or not it qualifies for the playoffs for the first time since 2006. The
playoff fate will likely come down to the final game of the season against Pine

* AUGMENT Bone Graft - AUGMENT Bone Graft is the first clinically proven protein
therapeutic to come to the U.S. orthopaedic market in over a decade, offering an
alternative to autograft in ankle and/or hindfoot fusion procedures.
Comprehensive clinical data demonstrates that AUGMENT Bone Graft offers clinical
outcomes equivalent to autogenous bone graft, while simultaneously avoiding the
additional surgery required to harvest autograft bone graft tissue that can
result in site-specific complications and/or prolonged harvest site pain in some
patients.

* SALVATION Limb Salvage Portfolio - The SALVATION Limb Salvage Portfolio is a
comprehensive portfolio of products that is designed to address fractures,
nonunion and complex foot and ankle deformities and is the first complete
portfolio of products to be specifically indicated for use to treat neuropathic
osteoarthropathy (commonly referred to as Charcot foot), a deformity that
results from nerve damage in the foot or ankle.

Robert Palmisano, president and chief executive officer, commented, "We have
continued to expand our broad product portfolio to further extend our leadership
position in three of the fastest growth areas in orthopaedics:  upper
extremities, lower extremities and biologics.  The specific features of our
SIMPLICITI shoulder system enable physicians to minimize bone disruption thereby
reducing procedure times, minimizing blood loss and exposure to anesthesia.
These benefits appeal not only to the surgeon, but to hospital administrators
looking to improve patient satisfaction while managing procedure costs.  In our
lower extremities business, the INFINITY ankle's lower profile design and
straightforward surgical approach is an important addition to the continuum of
care for end-stage ankle arthritis patients, and our AUGMENT Bone Graft provides
a breakthrough therapeutic option as an alternative to autograft in ankle and
hindfoot fusion procedures.  In addition, we have a unique opportunity to
address advanced reconstructive, limb salvage, and Charcot cases with the launch
of our SALVATION product portfolio."

Anti-corruption storm must cleanse SOEs

LENGTH: 341  words


THE CENTRAL COMMISSION for Discipline Inspection has released its report on
investigations of eight State-owned enterprises directly controlled by the
central authorities. The report reveals a rampant trade in power for money as
well as the transfer of enormous interests to certain bureaucrats. Comments:

Anti-graft agencies have branches in central SOEs, but they lack strong support.
In the enterprises mentioned in the CCDI report, the anti-graft branches were
either denied access to key information or were party to the corruption. It is
extremely urgent that supervision is strengthened to curb graft.

Liu Junhai, a professor of law at Renmin University of China, Feb 10

The fact that rampant corruption has been revealed shows the central
leadership's firm determination to root it out. In order to eradicate corruption
in central SOEs, the authorities need to continue applying pressure, and improve
the regulations so that power in SOEs is also placed under supervision.

xinhuanet.com, Feb 10

The Party and the government have rules that prohibit senior officials' spouses,
children and other family members from running business, but they have not been
well enforced. When senior officials' family members are appointed high
executives of central SOEs with monopoly power, it is extremely difficult to
fight corruption because the officials will prevent any anti-graft probe. It is
time to properly enforce the rules to better fight graft in central SOEs.

Wang Yukai, a professor at the Chinese Academy of Governance, Feb 8

The corruption of officials in central SOEs, which control huge amounts of
resources, has long been heard of and this time the CCDI has shown an iron hand.
Considering the rampancy of corruption, officials in these enterprises might
very possibly have already formed interest chains even networks; the anti-graft
authorities must be prepared for resistance from them. An anti-graft storm is
coming - hope it can wash away the dirty things hidden in central SOEs.

Boston Sci initiates first U.S. trial for covered stent

Boston Sci initiates first U.S. trial for covered stent

By AARON LORENZO Medical Device Daily Staff Writer The development of covered
stents took a step forward this week, as Boston Scientific (Natick,
Massachusetts) received investigational device exemption approval from the FDA
to begin its SYMBIOT III pivotal trial using the Symbiot Covered Stent System.

"This is our first trial in the United States," Paul Donovan, Boston
Scientific's vice president of corporate communications, said. "We're going to
get going shortly."

The randomized clinical trial was approved for 50 institutions and 700 patients
in the U.S. and Canada. The trial is designed to evaluate Symbiot's safety and
efficacy for the treatment of saphenous vein graft (SVG) disease. The company
expects to enroll the first patients in the trial shortly.

"We'll certainly have the trial fully enrolled here this year in the United
States," Donovan said. "Once you go from there, we're looking at hopefully
commercializing this in early 2004 in the United States. And we actually have
plans to commercialize it this spring in Europe and some other international
markets."

The stent is designed to address a number of problems that arise following
coronary artery bypass graft surgery.

During the procedure, saphenous veins are harvested from the leg and used as
grafts. But within a decade, most SVGs will have developed severe
atherosclerosis. Patients are then treated in the cardiac catheterization
laboratory, where stent implantation has become standard therapy due to limited
success of balloon angioplasty.

But problems persist. Conventional stents are not specifically designed for
treating this disease.

The company calls the Symbiot the first stent designed to address the two major
limitations of treating SVG disease: the risk of plaque embolization during the
procedure and poor long-term outcomes. The Symbiot is a laser-cut,
self-expanding nitinol stent encased in a thin porous ePTFE (expanded
polytetrafluoroethylene) polymer membrane.

"It's a covered stent, covered with a polymer membrane" Donovan said. "It's not
a drug-coated stent, there is no drug on this stent."

The ePTFE cover and self-expanding deployment are intended to work together to
reduce plaque embolization during the stenting procedure and provide a long-term
patient benefit by reducing restenosis.

"It's a very specific type of polymer," Donovan said.

ePTFE can be used to cover stents for peripheral and coronary applications and
in endovascular devices to treat abdominal aortic aneurysms. The ePTFE material
is accepted by body tissue, pliable and easily sutured as an implant material.

Other companies have developed stents made of similar material for other
purposes.

Earlier this year, C.R. Bard (Murray Hill, New Jersey) received an
investigational device exemption from the FDA for a clinical trial to examine
its own ePTFE-encapsulated self-expanding stent. Bard's stent is for the
treatment of venous anastomotic stenosis, a condition that occurs in many
dialysis patients who have been treated with an arterio-venous shunt.

Vascular Architects (San Jose, California) in March received CE mark approval to
market its aSpire Covered Stent and Controlled Release Delivery System in Europe
for treating peripheral vascular disease. aSpire is a spiral nitinol stent
completely covered by a thin layer of ePTFE.

Boston Scientific said that interim results from the SYMBIOT I and SYMBIOT II
clinical trials, both of which were conducted abroad, point to Symbiot's
potential to reduce complications and lower restenosis rates, leading the
company to move forward with these further studies. The company declined to
comment on specifics from the first two trials, though.

The new trial aims to demonstrate the Symbiot's superiority over conventional
stents in reducing restenosis. No information as to the length of patient
follow-up was available.

"The Symbiot stent promises to be an important addition to our growing stent
portfolio because it provides physicians an innovative technology uniquely
designed for treating a difficult clinical problem," Boston Scientific's
cardiovascular division president Paul LaViolette said in a statement. "We
continue to be optimistic about the potential of self-expanding ePTFE covered
stents as a new therapy for SVG disease."

A healthy gut could help prevent deadly side effect of bone marrow transplant

LENGTH: 494  words

DATELINE: Lahore



 Washington: American Association for the Advancement of Science has issued the
following news release:



  A healthy gut could help prevent deadly side effect of bone marrow transplant



 Could playing better defense make bone marrow transplants more successful?





 With this question in mind, researchers began looking at whether the trillions
of little bugs and bacteria living in our gastrointestinal tract could be the
key to playing defense.



 Up to half of patients who receive a bone marrow transplant from a donor will
develop severe gastrointestinal damage from graft vs. host disease, a condition
in which the donor cells attack the host's body. It's the reason why transplants
-- which can be very successful at eliminating cancers such as leukemia or
lymphoma -- are so risky.



 In a new study, published in Nature Immunology, researchers searched for
alterations in the gut microbiome to see whether their metabolites could impact
outcomes after BMT.



 They found that a metabolite called butyrate was significantly reduced in the
intestinal tract of experimental mice that received bone marrow transplant. When
the researchers increased butyrate in these mouse models, they saw a decrease in
the incidence and severity of graft vs. host disease.



 "Our findings suggest we can prevent graft vs. host disease by bolstering the
amount of the microbiome-derived metabolite butyrate," says study lead author
Pavan Reddy, M.D., the Moshe Talpaz Professor of Translational Pathology and
interim division chief of hematology/oncology at the University of Michigan.



 "If the GI gut lining can remain healthy and strong, it can resist the attack
by the donor immune system and hopefully prevent graft vs. host disease," he
adds.



 The researchers found that shifts in the gut's microbes result in a decrease in
butyrate. When they manipulated the microbes back to the original form, the
butyrate would come back up and mitigate graft vs. host disease.



 Diet is one way to control butyrate production by the gut microbiome,
specifically through resistant starch such as that found in potatoes.
Researchers hope to begin a clinical trial later this year that will look at
combining resistant starch with current methods of preventing graft vs. host to
assess whether they can increase butyrate -- and reduce graft vs. host.



 Current methods of preventing graft vs. host involve suppressing the immune
system, which suppresses the ability of the donor immune system to cause graft
vs. host disease. But it also means that other normal immune system functions
are suppressed -- including fighting infections or preventing cancer from
returning.



 "This is a whole new approach. The idea is to make the host cells stronger, to
be able to withstand the assault of the donor immune cells while reducing the
risk of infection or leukemia relapse," Reddy says.

School districts advocate for local control

BYLINE: Eric Schwartzberg, Journal-News, Hamilton, Ohio

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 635 words


Aug. 04--Forty-one school districts representing rural, suburban and urban
communities in Butler, Warren, Hamilton and Clermont counties are joining forces
to have Ohio and federal lawmakers leave educating to them.

The newly formed Greater Cincinnati School Advocacy Network called for returning
control of public schools to the local level via the elimination of state and
federal unfunded mandates.

The things that make local schools strong and special don't come from the
statehouse or Washington, but instead "bubble up from the local level," said
Gail Kist-Kline, superintendent of Mason City School District.

"Over the last decade, a mountain of new educational policies were put in place
at the state and federal level," Kist-Kline said. "Those mandates stem from the
idea that schools need fixed, but that's not the case. Our schools perform
better today, even while being asked to do more."

Kist-Kline said the layers of new mandates are now "untenable."

"What was once considered a 'creep' has become an avalanche," she said. "It's
time for the state to stop enacting unfunded mandates and other initiatives that
burden taxpayers and teachers. They do not help academic performance and they
reduce opportunities for innovation."

"It's time for the state to stop trying to fix a problem that doesn't exist,"
Kist-Kline said.

Asked for examples of unfunded mandates, school district officials listed off
the Ohio Teacher Evaluation System, Third Grade Reading Guarantee, College
Credit Plus, New Career Advising Policy and Student Success Plan, career
technical requirements at the junior high level and more.

"And the list goes on," said Jon Graft, superintendent at Butler County
Educational Service Center.

Legislators have overstepped their boundaries in the belief that "more testing
is better testing," Graft said.

"What we've seen with the amount of assessment that have been put into place
from Washington (D.C.) and from the state legislature isn't about learning, it's
about accountability and we are very much for accountability for our teaching
staff through our local school boards, Graft said.

Sam Ison, Superintendent of Middletown City School District, said he is "very
supportive" of the Greater Cincinnati School Advocacy Network and believes it's
time that district superintendents make their voices heard for the betterment of
education for their students and staff.

"We do believe in accountability, but not to the point of having mandates that
eat away class time," Ison said. "We need to spend more time with our students
preparing them for life in other areas than taking tests several times a year.
Our teachers are doing their best to teach life skills for success but when they
are constantly giving tests and preparing for tests as mandated, the time
connecting with students is getting less and less."

Graft said the network's advocacy work will be accomplished by having
conversations with community residents.

Each school district will develop its own way of doing so in "a variety of
settings," he said.

"Communities coming to schools and our teachers, administrators, classified
staff and all staff members in our local school districts going to the community
and talking with them about what it is that they want from us," Graft said.

Specifically, school districts intend to engage our communities in understanding
the unfunded mandates and how they impact teaching professionals and district
finances, said Bob Farrell, superintendent of Milford Exempted Village School
District and the former superintendent of Fairfield City School District.

"We will also engage them in reaching our legislators so that we are heard,"
Farrell said.

o Cytori (San Diego) reported the launch of PureGraft 250, a fat grafting
technology that standardizes the graft preparation process for use in aesthetic
body contouring. The PureGraft technology enables the physician to purify a fat
graft and remove excess 'graft fluid' in a controllable manner on the sterile
field. This is accomplished without centrifugation or other motorized methods.
The fat is added to the system and 15 minutes later, free lipid, blood cells,
infusion chemicals and excess fluid are removed. PureGraft technology 'dialyzes'
off everything but the pure fat tissue.

o Medtronic (Minneapolis) has received FDA approval for the Complete SE vascular
stent system to be used for the treatment of peripheral arterial disease in the
iliac arteries, major blood vessels within the pelvis that supply blood to the
lower extremities. The system features several novel advances, including an
innovative dual-deployment delivery system with a unique triaxial design. The
new delivery system is made up of an inner shaft, a retractable sheath and a
stabilizing sheath that reduces friction and allows the retractable sheath to
move back freely. This decreases the amount of force required to deploy the
stent, thereby making deployment easy and precise, the company said.

o Smith & Nephew's Orthopedics Division (Memphis, Tennessee) reported the
results of testing on its Verilast technology for knee replacement implants.
After simulating 30 years of physical activity on the company's Legion knee
replacement, Verilast technology produced an 81% reduction in wear, the leading
cause of knee replacement failure. Verilast technology is the combination of two
advanced bearing surface technologies: Smith & Nephew's metal alloy Oxinium
oxidized zirconium, used on the femoral side of the joint, and highly
cross-linked polyethylene (plastic), implanted on the tibial side. Oxinium
material has been in use in knee replacements for more than a decade, but was
only recently coupled with highly cross-linked polyethylene components. Oxinium
is a metal alloy that undergoes a proprietary heating process, transforming its
surface into a hard, smooth ceramic that is 4,900 times more resistant to
scratching than traditional materials.

OL' JR WILL BE MIGHTY UPSET

AW, shucks, Texas is showing signs of going respectable. I suppose the demise of
Dallas made it inevitable. Folks are just afraid to be shameless any more.

As a correspondent based in the American west, I used to love my regular visits
to Texas. California was vibrant but nutty; Texas was vibrant but funny and
wicked at once.

The State capital, Austin, epitomises the Texan qualities and failings: big
dreams, big talk, big bucks, big graft.

But even about the graft, Texas was frank. The whole legislative system is based
on shonky accounting.

Texas rewards its legislators with salaries of only $A10,000 or so a year.

That means they must be rich or prosperously sponsored by special interests.
Progress from the second group to the first is frequent.

The sponsorship is possible because Texan law makes it legal for a politician to
keep for his or her personal benefit any surplus from election campaigns.

As a way of legalising graft, that law takes some beating.

But beaten it is, because Texan law also makes it legal for any legislator to
accept any gift from anyone for any purpose, as long as the gift is declared.

So it was that when, in 1989, the Texan chicken king, Lonnie "Bo" Pilgrim,
marched onto the floor of the State Senate and handed out $A12,500 cheques to
senators, he was acting quite legally.

There was a bill before the Senate proposing large increases in
workers'compensation for industrial injuries, and "Bo" didn't like that.

But just to show how Texas is changing, there was a public outcry.

"Chickengate" was the shout from the media, which was unusual in itself because
the media in Texas have a very high threshold of outrage.

Most of the beneficiaries even gave the money back. See, it was time for J.R.
Ewing to go.

Now, Texas has a new and reformist governor, the tough-talking Democrat Ann
Richards. Ms Richards is pushing reforms on a number of fronts, including
legislators' treatment of campaign funds and lobbyists. She's a real spoilsport.

The British magazine The Economist observed in a recent article on Texas: "At
the beginning of the 20th century, Texan lobbyists could get more or less what
they wanted so long as they kept politicians supplied with the three Bs:
beefsteak, bourbon and blondes. Things have not changed all that much."

Well, that's a bit tough. At least these days the politicians tend to get their
knuckles rapped.

In the past two decades, three Speakers of the Legislature and more than 20
other politicians have been indicted on corruption charges.

And to be corrupt by Texan standards, you really have to be trying.

Now, under an emergency ethics law, things will be somewhat less freewheeling.

In Australia, where we begrudge our politicians every cent of their pay, we
might learn from Texas that underpaying politicians brings its own problems,
too.

So is government in Texas all graft and corruption; the cynical in league with
the lawless?

Not at all.

Gloriously unpredictable as ever, Texas boasts some of the most able and
cleverest politicians in the US.

Well, maybe that's not so surprising. Look at Miss Ellie, J.R.'s mum, a splendid
person. Spending much of your life with cruds doesn't necessarily make you
cruddy.

Agreements/contracts: TGI to patent genomic biomarker technology

LENGTH: 355 words

Staff Report

Transplant Genomics (TGI; Brookline, Massachusetts) said it has obtained an
exclusive license to patent rights co-owned by The Scripps Research Institute
(San Diego) and Northwestern University (Chicago) that provides the foundation
for clinical tests to improve management of organ transplant recipients, with
what TGI calls the potential to extend lives and reduce costs of associated
healthcare. The company intends to make tests that use genomic markers of
transplant graft status as part of a surveillance program to detect and respond
to early signs of graft injury.

TGI says this licensing agreement provides it with access to a broad portfolio
of intellectual property related to kidney and liver transplant diagnostics,
including immune status monitoring and optimization. TGI's scientific founders,
Michael Abecassis (Northwestern Medicine) and Daniel Salomon (The Scripps
Research Institute), have been recognized for their work on discovery and
validation of novel biomarkers of graft and immune status for solid-organ
transplants.

TGI's first test will be used to routinely monitor kidney transplant recipients,
indicating when treatment or biopsy is required based on analysis of a patient's
blood. As described in a study involving seven transplant centers recently
published in the American Journal of Transplantation, peripheral blood gene
expression profiling was used to classify kidney graft recipients into three key
categories of graft status (acute rejection, acute dysfunction/no rejection, and
stable graft performance) with very high predictive accuracy. Ongoing
prospective studies will reveal how far in advance of dysfunction these
signatures can be detected, and whether they can be used to monitor the
effectiveness of treatment. The need for such improved tests is highlighted by
the fact that more than 15% of kidney transplant patients with normal serum
creatinine levels, the most commonly used indicator of graft injury, show signs
of rejection when their grafts are analyzed by protocol biopsy up to one year
post-transplant.

Transplant Genomics is a molecular diagnostics company.

UK agency issues alert about Medtronic stent graft fractures

 The UK Medical Devices Agency has issued an alert instructing physicians to
X-ray all patients implanted with the AneuRx stent graft made by Medtronic
(Minneapolis, Minnesota). The alert was issued following discovery of device
fractures in two patients there, and it is the second such warning in the UK
concerning the device.

The device is used to treat abdominal aortic aneurysm and has been implanted in
about 700 patients in the UK and, worldwide, about 10,000. Medtronic has
estimated that the fracture may occur in about .05% of the implanted devices. It
reported that eight of the devices have been removed so far. The reports
indicated that the nitinol frame of the stent had broken, and the X-ray
examination was recommended to identify suture breakage, migration of the device
or other problems associated with the fracture.

The FDA approved the device in September 1999. Following that approval, the
agency issued a warning letter to Medtronic saying that the company had
inaccurately reported problems with the device in a pivotal trial. In June, the
company recalled one model of the device with a 21 Fr tapered nosecone, saying
that this tip possibly could detach from the catheter."

Hancock Jaffe files PMA for ProCol vascular bioprosthesis

Hancock Jaffe files PMA for ProCol vascular bioprosthesis

By HOLLAND JOHNSON  Medical Device Daily Senior Staff Writer  Hancock Jaffe
Laboratories (Irvine, California) has submitted a premarket approval application
(PMA) to the FDA seeking permission to market its ProCol vascular bioprosthesis
for hemodialysis access in the U.S.

The application follows the successful completion of a U.S. multi-center
clinical trial that involved 276 patients. The company said the trial, whose
results are yet to be published, provided encouraging results in an extremely
challenging cohort of patients. In order to qualify for inclusion in the trial,
all patients, in addition to any prior failures of native AV fistulae or
catheter access sites, were required to have failed at least one prior
prosthetic access graft.

"This new bioprosthesis should be the conduit of choice in this complex group of
patients as it offers patency rates similar to those commonly experienced by
patients without a history of multiple prosthetic graft failures," said Marc
Glickman, MD of Eastern Virginia Medical Center (Norfolk, Virginia), lead
investigator in the U.S. ProCol clinical trials.

Patients suffering from end-stage renal disease (about 250,000 in the U.S.)
require dialysis treatment in order to cleanse their blood of waste products.
The dialysis machine and filters replace the function of the patient's kidneys.
Many patients receive blood purification via hemodialysis, which requires the
creation of an access site in order to remove and purify the blood before
returning it to the patient. One option for hemodialysis access is the creation
of an arteriovenous fistula, in which an artery and vein are surgically
connected to provide the necessary access site. In cases where a fistula does
not develop into a usable access (up to 30% of all cases), or where a fistula
has already failed, a prosthetic bridge graft frequently is implanted. Failure
of the arteriovenous access is the leading cause of hospitalization among
hemodialysis patients and costs around $1 billion a year in the U.S.

The ProCol vascular graft is a natural vessel, manufactured from a bovine
mesenteric vein, which is processed to render it inert and fully biocompatible.
The process for preserving the graft is relatively simple, having similarities
to that of preserving heart valve tissue, which involves cellular cross-linking.
The product, which has a shelf life of about 4 1/2 years, is intended for use as
a prosthetic graft in cases where the patient's own blood vessels are not
suitable or available for use.

The ProCal, which has been in development since the mid-1990s, was granted a CE
mark in 1998. The company said the length of delay in gaining a U.S. clearance
has nothing to do with the efficacy of the device, but rather, speaks to the
need for extensive clinical trials in order to curry FDA favor.

"Because it's a biological graft, we have to go the Class III route for U.S.
approval, and that's why there has been such a lag time between the CE mark and
getting our FDA approval because we had to do a full-blown clinical trial,"
Elizabeth Peacock, vice president of sales and marketing for Hancock Jaffe, told
Medical Device Daily.However, she said that the creation of the new hybrid
devices division at the FDA has helped speed up the process. "Everything seems
to be going a little faster, that's certainly been our experience of late."

While Peacock noted that the trials in the U.S. are currently focused on "re-do"
patients, she said the company has another trial that is ongoing that looks at
first access patients - those who are implanted with the device as their initial
treatment - and noted that the company would file a PMA supplement for those
patients once the company has gained its initial approval. "We decided that for
our PMA approval we wanted to demonstrate that we could help patients who were
really high risk in this critical situation, so that's why we made our first
trial focused upon the redo population," Peacock said.

While declining to cite specific numbers in the trial prior to publication, she
noted that in the U.S trial, which compared the device to a PTFE (a polymer used
as a surgical implant material for many prostheses), she said the results were
"significantly better for the ProCol graft as far as secondary patency and
overall interventions and incidences of thrombosis."

The ProCol is manufactured in a range of diameters and lengths and already is
used in Europe for peripheral arterial bypass and coronary artery bypass
procedures as well as for hemodialysis access. Peacock said the company
definitely envisions approvals for those other uses in the U.S., though that
will take some time.

"We will certainly do that, but that will require us moving on to the next
clinical trial," she said. As a next course of action, she said the company
might pursue the peripheral arterial bypass market in the U.S., specifically,
below knee reconstructions. "That's the most challenging, when you don't have
another autologous vessel they can use a lot of times surgeons are very
reluctant to use a PTFE graft below the knee because historically, it's been
shown that they don't perform too well."

While Peacock noted that a PTFE graft, which is less expensive than a biological
graft such as the ProCol (about one and a half to two times the cost) is a more
logical choice for many surgeries, in certain circumstances, the biological
device is a better alternative. She concluded that the company hopes for an
initial approval for the ProCol in about six months in a "best-case scenario."

State lawyers oppose Purisima travel bid

LENGTH: 684  words


State prosecutors have opposed the plea of dismissed Philippine National Police
(PNP) chief Alan Purisima for a three-week travel to the United States.

In its comment opposition filed before the Sandiganbayan Sixth Division, the
Office of the Special Prosecutor said Purisima did not indicate his itinerary in
the three-week stay in US, warning that his escape from the charges is possible.

'Accused failed to indicate his itinerary during his 22-day visit in the USA as
it cannot be gainsaid that he will just be staying at the address indicated in
his motion,' the prosecution said.

'It cannot therefore be denied that the probability of accused of not returning
to the Philippines is very imminent,' it added.

The prosecution said there is no urgency for Purisima to leave the country and
visit his son, noting that he is facing graft charges over the anomalous gun
license courier deal when he was PNP chief.

'From the tenor and import of accused's motion, no urgent or compelling reason
can be discerned to justify the grant of judicial imprimatur thereto. Accused
has not sufficiently shown that there is absolute necessity for him to travel
abroad,' the prosecution said.

The prosecution said the court should deny Purisima's travel motion to maintain
its jurisdiction over the accused as he faces graft trial.

'Wherefore, it is respectfully prayed of this Honorable Court to deny the
present motion for utter lack of merit,' the prosecution said.

In his travel motion, Purisima asked the court's permission to visit his son
Jason Arvi, who is studying at the Culinary Institute of America at St. Helena
in California, from Sept. 5 to 27.

Purisima said his scheduled flight was booked way back March 2016.

'Prior to the filing of the present case, particularly on March 15, 2016,
accused Purisima, together with his family, scheduled a flight to the United
States of America from September 5 to 27, 2016 Accused Purisima will be staying
at 1108 Pintail Drive, Suison City, California USA 94585,' the motion read.

Purisima, a friend of former president Benigno Aquino III, and 16 others were
charged with one count of graft for acting allegedly with manifest partiality,
evident bad faith and gross inexcusable negligence when they awarded the courier
contract to the firm WerFastDocumentary Agency, Inc.

The prosecution said Purisima violated Section 3(e) of the Anti-Graft and
Corrupt Practices Act when he gave unwarranted benefit to Werfast.

Purisima entered into a memorandum of agreement (MOA) with Werfast and
accredited the firm as the PNP's courier service provider for all the firearms
license applications despite its failure to comply with government regulations
on courier services.

Purisima and the respondents also approved the delivery by courier of firearms
license as a mandatory policy in the PNP.

The prosecution said Werfast failed to seek prior registration with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, and failed to get authority from the
Department of Transportation and Communications to operate a delivery service as
well as an accreditation from the Department of Science and Technology.

Earlier, the Ombudsman dismissed Purisima, and the others for the administrative
offense of grave misconduct, serious dishonesty and grave abuse of authority.
The officials were forfeited of their retirement benefits and barred from being
reemployed in government.

In ordering the graft charges, the Ombudsman said Purisima entered into a
courier service contract with Werfast although the latter had no corporate
existence and juridical personality when the PNP entered into a MOA in May 2011.

The Ombudsman found that no public bidding was conducted, and that the MOA was
entered into although Werfast lacked the track record as a courier service
company.

Besides the Werfast case, the Ombudsman also ordered the filing of graft and
usurpation of powers charges against Purisima and sacked Special Action Force
(SAF) commander Getulio Napenas for violating the police chain of command in the
botched anti-terror raid 'Oplan Exodus' that resulted in the deaths of 44 elite
cops in Mamasapano, Maguindanao.

Science report: 'New cells for old' heal wounds

BYLINE: BARRY SHURLOCK

SECTION: Issue 62532.

LENGTH: 560 words


Cells from young people are being used to make biological dressings for treating
non-healing wounds in elderly people, whose own cells multiply too slowly.

Skin cells from the donor are grown several layers deep in culture and then
fixed to the surface of the dressings, which are used like conventional skin
grafts.


The new grafts (called cultured allografts) could be a significant advance for
many of the 300,000 people in the UK who are estimated to suffer from leg
ulcers, according to skin specialist Dr Irene Leigh, who leads the team which is
developing the new treatment at the London Hospital, Whitechapel.

Leg ulcers are generally a problem of the elderly: they often do not respond to
conventional treatment and may cause pain and discomfort over many years. The
new allografts have been shown to relieve pain within 24 hours and to promote
healing in about 60 to 70 per cent of cases.

The discovery that the grafts are not generally rejected, despite consisting of
'foreign' cells, came as a surprise to the London group, whose work was prompted
by what where regarded as incredible claims by Dr Jack Hefton, the man who first
used cultured allografts in 1983 at Cornell University, New York.

The London studies follow earlier work on cultured skin cells which showed that
grafts grown from patients' own skin cells (called autografts) can be used
effectively to heal leg ulcers, burns, wounds, and other serious injuries.
However, the snag with autografts is that the cells of many elderly people have
lost the ability to replicate rapidly in culture.

This problem has been overcome in the allograft technique by using cells taken
from young women undergoing breast reduction and other forms of cosmetic
surgery.

Examples of cases in which cultured allografts have been used with great success
at the London Hospital were presented recently by Dr Tania Phillips at a meeting
of the British Association of Dermatologists, held at Sheffield University.

A typical case was that of an elderly patient who had been suffering
continuously since 1970 from ulceration, including two attempts at skin
grafting. The ulcers would not heal, said Dr Phillips. With the use of cultured
allografts, healing was achieved after a few weeks and is still maintained after
a year, she said.

The apparent lack of rejection, which is found in about half of the allografts,
is thought to be due to the absence of the Langerhans cells, which are not
supported in culture. They play a major role in promoting rejection by
recognizing foreign antigens in the skin.

The researchers are not yet sure whether the allograft cells become incorporated
into the patient's tissues or act as a biological dressing for long enough to
allow their own skin cells to grow over the wound.

Dr Leigh said: 'We suspect that they 'take' initially and are then gradually
replaced by the recipient's skin cells without any rejection episode. '

Some skin specialists have suggested that the promising results reported by the
London group are a placebo effect due to the closer attention given to patients,
but Dr Phillips refutes this.

If she is right, there are many thousands of elderly patients who will
eventually benefit, together with their GPs and district nurses, whose services
are at present needed for regular dressing of wounds.

Graft procedure popularity grows

BYLINE: Rob Amen

LENGTH: 577 words


As a child, Ernest Manders accompanied his father, an engineer, on annual trips
to the Southern Research Institute in Birmingham, Ala.

"Every year they had a big science fair that they featured research they were
working on," Manders said. "One of the things I saw was that darn hot dog."

The hot dog that fascinated Manders had been preserved by irradiation, using
gamma rays, in an attempt to develop nonrefrigerated field rations for the Army.
Forty years later, the memory of that hot dog led Manders to design a way to
preserve human skin so it could be stored at room temperature for use in grafts.

GammaGrafts, as Manders' Uptown company, Promethean LifeSciences, calls the
preserved tissue, have revolutionized skin-grafting procedures and are widely
used in burns and other skin-loss injuries across the country, including in the
military in Iraq and Afghanistan.

"The military has used hundreds," said Manders' son, Christian Manders,
Promethean's chief operating officer. "Some of the grafts have been used on
Iraqis and Afghanis who have been injured." The Virtual Naval Hospital cites
GammaGraft as a treatment for burns, and the preserved skin has been featured in
various medical publications.

The GammaGrafts can be stored in airtight foil packaging for up to two years at
room temperature.

GammaGrafts adhere to burns and other wounds, essentially sealing off the
injured area. According to Christian Manders, this promotes an ideal environment
for a person's skin to regenerate underneath the GammaGraft.

GammaGrafts don't need to be covered with a protective dressing after one day of
application and can get wet, unlike with other grafts of transplanted human
skin, called allografts. The GammaGraft also reduces pain around the wound site,
the company says.

When a person's skin has re-covered the wound, the GammaGraft flakes off,
Christian Manders said.

Previously, human skin allografts consisted of living cells and had to be stored
at about minus-80 degrees Celsius. But many hospitals are not equipped to
accommodate such storage, requiring human skin allografts to be transported on
demand.

"We wanted to make a skin graft available in any hospital, in any clinic, in any
doctor's office, by making it storable at room temperature," said Ernest
Manders, Promethean's chief executive officer and a plastic surgeon who teaches
at the University of Pittsburgh. "It dawned on me that allograft doesn't need to
be alive to be a good wound cover."

This realization struck Manders, now 60, while he served as a visiting professor
in the burn unit of Hospital Das Cl'nicas, affiliated with the University of São
Paulo, in Brazil in 1992.

On his flight home, he devised an experiment to test if human skin allograft
could be stored at room temperature. Eventually, he developed a procedure to
preserve the skin by irradiating it. The skin comes from organ and tissue
donors.

Promethean began producing GammaGrafts in 1998 and was selling them nationwide a
year later.

UPMC, Allegheny General and St. Clair hospitals use GammaGrafts, Christian
Manders said, as do the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C., and
Naval Medical Center San Diego.

The military began using GammaGrafts in Iraq and Afghanistan about 2 1/2 years
ago, the Christian Manders said.

"It's being made every day," Ernest Manders said. "Basically, we've had a
problem keeping it on our shelves of late. It goes all over the United States of
America."

And beyond.

Artificial skin grown for grafts

BYLINE: SALLY MACMILLAN

LENGTH: 269 words


SKIN grown in the laboratory may soon make painful skin grafts an ordeal of the
past.

"It looks like skin - it's amazing," said Steven Caywood, president of
Pittsburgh's West Penn Hospital, which is to test the new skin product.

"We're excited. This could be a major breakthrough, if it works.

"In time, if the trials prove out, this can virtually eliminate the need for
skin grafts, which is a very painful process."

Researchers from Organogenesis Inc. and the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology developed the lab skin from living tissue.

"Lasagna-sized" sheets of skin, called living skin equivalent, are grown in a
laboratory over eight weeks.

The tissue used, Mr Caywood said, came from aborted foetuses or was taken during
biopsies of the patient receiving the new skin.

The laboratory product was adhered to a wound in the same way skin grafts were
applied.

The laboratory skin was approved for human use late last month by the US Food
and Drug Administration after two years of animal experiments.

West Penn, chosen for the trials because of its high percentage of critically
burnt patients and the amount of its plastic and reconstructive surgery, will be
the first hospital in America to use the skin.

"It may provide a means of wound coverage for victims who, because of the extent
of their burns, do not have enough available unburnt skin of their own for a
graft," said hospital burn-trauma centre founder Dr John Gaisford, who will
direct the trials.

"For these extensive burns, living skin equivalent may eliminate the need for
harvesting the patient's own skin."

Test Device Appears to Aid Repair of Potentially Fatal Aneurysm

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN

SECTION: Section A;  Page 18;  Column 1;  National Desk

LENGTH: 789 words


An experimental device that reinforces the body's main artery when it is
weakened by an aneurysm can greatly simplify surgical repair of the condition, a
new study being reported today shows.

An aneurysm is a ballooning of an artery, and it usually develops painlessly.
But an aneurysm can burst without warning, and cause death within minutes.
Aneurysms frequently develop on the body's main artery, the aorta, which carries
blood from the heart to supply oxygen and other nutrients to the rest of the
body.

Until recently, the standard procedure for repairing an aortic aneurysm before
it burst involved making a long incision in the chest or abdomen, removing the
damaged part of the artery, and replacing it with a prosthetic graft.

The new procedure is less painful and seems to have fewer risks than the
standard surgery. Doctors perform it by making small incisions in the groin to
insert a thin tube and the collapsed experimental device into an artery. Then,
aided by X-rays, they guide the device to the aneurysm, where it is then
expanded. Blood flows through the new channel, relieving pressure on the
weakened aorta.

Preliminary results indicate that the new procedure allows a speedier recovery
and is less costly because a patient can leave the hospital and regain normal
function much sooner than after standard aneurysm surgery.

The idea of using devices to repair aortic aneurysms dates at least to 1969 when
Dr. Charles T. Dotter tried it on animals at the University of Oregon in
Portland. In 1991, Dr. Juan C. Parodi of Buenos Aires reported using a device to
repair abdominal aortic aneurysms in humans.

The surgical team at Stanford University in California that wrote today's report
in The New England Journal of Medicine said it was the first to use such a
device to repair aortic aneurysms in the chest.

A version of the less invasive procedure has been used for aneurysms in the
abdomen, but at the moment it is appropriate only for a small proportion of
aneurysms. In the abdomen it is appropriate only for those that occur below the
arteries supplying blood to the kidneys and above where the aorta branches into
the arteries that run down the legs.

When an aneurysm is in the abdomen, hooks that are attached to the ends of the
device are pressed in place by inflating a small balloon attached to the tube.
Then the tube and balloon are removed, leaving the graft in place.

The less invasive abdominal procedure and the standard operation are being
compared in a Food and Drug Administration-approved study of 150 patients in
several hospitals in this country.

The device used in the Stanford study is different because the aorta in the
chest has a larger diameter than it does in the abdomen. The device for the
chest consists of stainless steel stents covered with woven Dacron grafts that
are designed for each patient to account for the size, site and other anatomical
features of the aneurysm.

The chest procedure requires general anesthesia and an X-ray procedure known as
aortography that requires injection of a radio-opaque dye into the aorta to see
the pattern of the artery and its branches.

In the chest, aortic aneurysms occur most commonly in the descending portion as
the artery curves downward after its branches supply blood to the neck and head.

The Stanford team, which was headed by Dr. Michael D. Dake, reported on 33
patients who had had the procedure since July 1992 and who were selected from
among a much larger group of patients.

Two patients died. Repair of aortic aneurysms involves a considerable risk of
paralysis because of the disruption of blood flow in the branches of the aorta
that feed the spinal cord. Paralysis developed in one of the two patients who
later died, and in another patient, for a total of 6 percent, compared with 5
percent in the standard operation, the authors said.

Although preliminary results show the procedure is safe, Dr. Dake's team
cautioned that careful evaluation of the frequency of complications over at
least a four-year-period is needed before the procedure becomes standard. If the
device leads to expansion of the aneurysm, the complication could be the
Achilles' heel of the new procedure, the authors said.

When aortic aneurysms burst, the patients often die before they can get to a
hospital. Even when emergency surgery can be performed, the death rate is about
50 percent. But when an aneurysm is detected by imaging techniques like
ultrasound, and the standard repair is made electively, the death rate is about
12 percent.

Aneurysms most commonly result from atherosclerosis, or the buildup of fatty
deposits in the wall of the aorta, but they can also stem from birth defects and
injuries.

Doctor dismisses rift over skin graft op

BYLINE:  Noni Mokati

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 568 words


There's no bad blood between renowned plastic surgeon Dr Ridwan Mia and the
parents of young burn victim Celiwe Maseko.

This is according to Mia, who this week said he was still talking to, and
advising Celiwe's parents, Katlego and Brown Maseko.

Recent reports suggested that the Masekos took Mia to task over the skin graft
operation he conducted on their daughter almost three months ago.

The contention is that Mia coerced the couple into believing that skin cloning
was the best option rather than the usual clinical skin graft operation.

Celiwe, five, returned to Netcare Garden City Hospital, where she is being
treated for an infection to her grafts.

"Since Tuesday I have been speaking to Katlego and Brown about Celiwe's wounds
and how we are going to address the issue. They have indicated that they have
never had a problem with the previous skin graft procedure. So this news come as
a surprise to me," he said.

Mia received a letter from Celiwe's parents asking that he hand over his
clinical notes.

Mia maintained that he consulted the family on many occasions about the
operation and explained their options.

"I even presented my thoughts to Wits and the University of Namibia about
ethical issues surrounding the cloning of skin. There were questions on whether
this was ethical or not. It is nothing that was done overnight."

The "clash" between the two parties is believed to have stemmed from a tabloid
report that Mia claimed he was obliged to operate on Celiwe.

But Mia said this was not true.

A source told Independent Newspapers that at the heart of the dispute were
questions about why the operation was conducted on Celiwe when she sustained
only 30 percent burns to her upper body.

Guidelines on Epicel, the name of the procedure for skin cloning, indicate that
the procedure can be used on patients who have deep dermal or full thickness
burns on at least 30 percent of their body.

Celiwe received her cloned skin in April following an accident at her home in
January when her dress caught fire.

A sample of her skin was sent to Genyzme lab in Boston, Massachusetts, where it
was cloned, harvested and brought back to the country.

This was the second operation in Africa. The first one was performed on Isabelle
Pippie Kruger, who sustained 80 percent burns to her body.

Mia said Celiwe was re-admitted to hospital this week after he noticed some
areas of her wounds were extremely red and pus was visible.

Celiwe also had flu, which meant her immune system was run down.

"We have cleaned the affected areas to remove infectious-looking tissue. We will
check her again and in two or three days and start placing other skin grafts."

Mia said the timeline for recovery with skin cloning was awkward because
patients took much longer to heal - very much as Pippie has done.

Pippie's mom, Anika Kruger, said her daughter was doing well. She was, however,
saddened that a good initiative had become controversial. "There are always
other choices. I could have opted to put a different form of skin on my daughter
using other techniques but I opted for Epicel and was never forced into doing
it. I, too, believe it was the best option."

Celiwe's operation was funded by money from Pippie's Gesigie Fund.

Kruger said the relationship between her and Celiwe's parents was strained but
would not elaborate.

Katlego, said: " I can't comment now. Please speak to my lawyer."

The lawyer had not contacted us by deadline.

   LeMaitre Vascular makes the veins run on time. The company makes both
disposable and implanted surgical vascular devices, including catheters and
stents, under such brands as AnastoClip, EndoFit, and Pruitt-Inahara. Originally
founded by a vascular surgeon to develop a valvulotome to prepare veins for
arterial bypass surgery, the company has since expanded its offerings to include
a device to create dialysis access sites and another to treat aortic aneurysms.
Le Maitre sells 12 product lines, most of which are used in open vascular
surgery and some of which are used in endovascular procedures. Its products are
sold to hospitals in North America, Europe, and Japan through a direct sales
force.

   Geographic Reach

   The company manufactures most of its products in a single facility in
Massachusetts.

   In an effort to tap into the world's third-largest medical device market,
LaMaitre opened its first office in China in mid-2014.

   Sales and Marketing

   LeMaitre sells its products through a direct sales force, but also relies on
a few distributors in several countries. The company, however, is expanding its
sales force to reach its customers more directly.

   Strategy

   The company has grown by competing in niche markets, expanding its worldwide
direct sales force, and acquiring and developing complementary vascular devices.
LeMaitre also intends to grow by pursuing regulatory approval of its products in
new markets.

   Along with acquisitions, product enhancements and developments are at the
heart of the firm's growth strategy. As new products are acquired or launched,
the company also cleans out its closet and discontinues or divests products it
no longer considers complementary.

   Mergers and Acquisitions

   In 2016, LeMaitre acquired Restore Flow Allografts for $14 million plus
potential performance payments. Restore Flow processes and cryopreserves
vascular veins and arteries, which LeMaitre will use as it expands its range of
biologic products. Other recent acquisitions for the company include OmniFlow II
and ProCol.

   Company Background

   LeMaitre was founded in 1983 by vascular surgeon George D. LeMaitre, to
develop a valvulotome to prepare veins for arterial bypass surgery.

   In 2006 LeMaitre Vascular raised more than $30 million from its initial
public offering. The company spent part of the proceeds to pay off debt; it also
used proceeds toward its goals of increasing research and development efforts,
hiring new sales representatives, and acquiring complementary products or
businesses.

Agreements/Contracts: CryoLife acquires rights for ProCol from Hancock Labs

LENGTH: 768 words

Staff Report

CryoLife (Atlanta), a medical device and tissue processing company focused on
cardiac and vascular surgery, has acquired the worldwide distribution rights for
the ProCol Vascular Bioprosthesis from Hancock Jaffe Laboratories (Irvine,
California).  In addition, beginning 24 months after execution of the agreement,
CryoLife has the right to acquire the ProCol product line from Hancock Jaffe.

ProCol, which is approved for sale in the U.S., is a natural biological graft
derived from a bovine mesenteric vein that provides vascular access for
end-stage renal disease (ESRD) hemodialysis patients.

It is intended for the creation of a bridge graft for vascular access subsequent
to at least one previously failed prosthetic access graft. ProCol is
complementary to CryoLife's HeRO Graft (Hemodialysis Reliable Outflow), which
also serves patients with ESRD. ProCol provides vascular access for
earlier-stage ESRD patients, while HeRO Graft is designed for patients with
limited access options and central venous obstruction.

Steven Anderson, chairman, president/CEO of CryoLife, said, "The ProCol Vascular
Bioprosthesis is an excellent product for vascular access, with a small but
loyal base of existing customers. We believe it has significant potential to
gain market share when sold through our established commercial organization,
which includes 36 sales representatives selling into the cardiovascular and
vascular access markets.  In addition, ProCol is complementary to the HeRO Graft
, and many of its existing customers are also HeRO Graft users.  We look forward
to working with Hancock Jaffe, and we are eager to launch ProCol through our
team in the second half of 2014."

Marc Glickman, MD, chief of vascular surgery, Sentara Healthcare, said, "There
is an increasing demand for vascular access options to address the growing
number of end-stage renal disease hemodialysis patients.  The ProCol Vascular
Bioprosthesis is an excellent option for these patients, and clinical data shows
that it provides excellent patency when patients are faced with repeated
failures of other grafts.  In addition, ProCol is flexible and easy to suture,
making it easy to implant in difficult cases, and it can be used in a variety of
configurations and access sites."

CryoLife intends to sell the currently available units of ProCol to existing
ProCol customers beginning in 2Q14, with sales of additional units beginning
immediately following FDA approval of the PMA Supplement associated with Hancock
Jaffe's new manufacturing facilities, which is expected to occur during the
second half of 2014. The company expects to complete the training of its
cardiovascular sales team by July, with the full U.S. commercial launch in the
second half of 2014, pending FDA approval of Hancock Jaffe's PMA Supplement.
CryoLife will provide additional details on the distribution agreement and
updated financial guidance in conjunction with its first quarter 2014 financial
results conference call in April 2014.

In other agreements/contracts news, Toshiba America Medical Systems (Tustin,
California) says its Dose Tracking System is the latest advancement in
optimizing dose management for its Infinix-i cardiovascular X-ray systems during
adult and pediatric interventional procedures.

"We partnered with Toshiba to develop the Dose Tracking System to further
improve the safety and well-being of patients during interventional procedures,"
said Neil Dashkoff, MD, clinical professor of medicine, University at Buffalo;
director, Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory, Erie County Medical Center. "This
user-friendly Dose Tracking System assists the operator to 'spread the skin
dose,' minimizing the risk of deterministic skin injury to any given area. This
is particularly important during long interventional procedures and in
circumstances where the patient may return to the cath lab within a few months
of the incident procedure."

Toshiba's Dose Tracking System displays live and cumulative radiation exposure
through an intuitive, color-coded indicator on a 3-D visual representation of
the patient. The display shows where the radiation is being administered on the
patient's body in real time. This allows the clinician throughout a procedure to
make quick and necessary changes to distribute the skin dose and minimize the
potential risk of locally concentrated high exposure.

Toshiba is a provider of medical diagnostic imaging systems and comprehensive
medical solutions, such as CT, X-ray and vascular, ultrasound, nuclear medicine
and MRI systems, as well as information systems for medical institutions.

DEAL WITH BARD BUOYS POSSIS STOCK

BYLINE: BYLINE: Judith Yates Borger, Staff Writer

SECTION: BUSINESS TWIN CITIES; Medical Technology; Pg. 1C

LENGTH: 449 words


Possis Medical announced Wednesday that it has signed a 10-year agreement with
Bard Vascular Systems to sell a self-sealing artificial blood vessel that
simplifies kidney dialysis.

Stock in Possis Medical closed up 25 cents a share to $8 after news of the deal
to sell its perma-seal dialysis access graft.

Bard paid Possis $250,000 cash and promised a possible additional $2.75 million,
after Possis achieves certain milestones involving federal regulatory approval.
In August Possis applied to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for approval
to market its perma-seal graft. It expects a response soon.

"This is very positive news," said Doug Eayrs, a John G. Kinnard analyst who has
a "strong buy" recommendation for Possis. "It's a good strategic fit for both
companies."

Bard Vascular Systems Division is a unit of C.R. Bard Corp., which has worldwide
annual sales of more than $1 billion. The vascular division sells vascular
grafts and kidney dialysis equipment but does not have its own general dialysis
graft, Eayrs said.

The Possis perma-seal graft is an artificial blood vessel inserted into a
patient's arm or leg. When a patient undergoes kidney dialysis, needles are put
into the artificial vessel, rather than the patient's own vessels. Because
kidney dialysis patients have their blood cleansed three times a week, the
artificial vessel saves wear and tear on their veins and arteries.

Needles removed from grafts currently on the market leave a hole that takes 15
to 30 minutes to close, Eayrs said. The perma-seal graft self-seals in three to
five minutes.

As a company emerging from the development stage with this product, Golden
Valley-based Possis does not have the marketing ability that Bard does, Eayrs
said. This agreement gives Possis "a credible marketing partner," Eayrs said.
Bard will sell the product in the United States and Japan, Eayrs said.

Under the agreement, Possis will be the original equipment manufacturer for the
graft, then sell it to Bard.

Eayrs estimated that grafts will sell to hospitals for about $650 to $700. He
anticipated that Bard would get about one-third of that payment and Possis would
get the rest.

Possis also has other products under development.

"We expect the perma-seal graft to be the first of our initial three key
products to be released for sale in the United States," said Robert Dutcher,
president and CEO of Possis Medical.

The company also has an artificial coronary graft and a device that cleans out
clogged blood vessels using high-pressure water. In January 1994 Possis Medical
completed a conversion to a medical device company from an engineering company.

Study: Endovascular AAA repair better than surgery in short term

Study: Endovascular AAA repair better than surgery in short term

By AMANDA PEDERSEN Medical Device Daily Staff Writer

Compared to open surgery,  endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm
(AAA) is associated with lower  short-term rates of death and complications
(1.2% vs. 4.8%), a study published  last week in the New England Journal of
Medicine concluded. But there are  trade-offs between the two approaches, and
the survival advantage of  endovascular repair gradually wanes over three years.

The study, based on a review of 45,660 Medicare discharges, also found that by
four years rupture was more likely in patients treated with endovascular repair
than in open repair (1.8% vs. 0.5%), as was reintervention related to AAA (9%
vs. 1.7%). In contrast, surgery for laparotomy-related complications was more
likely among patients who had undergone open repair (9.7%, vs. 4.1%), as was
hospitalization without surgery for bowel obstruction or abdominal-wall hernia
(14.2% vs. 8.1%).

The study, "Endovascular vs. Open Repair of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms in the
Medicare Population" -- authored by Marc Schermerhorn, MD; A. James O'Malley,
PhD; Ami Jhaveri, MD; Philip Cotterill, PhD; Frank Pomposelli, MD, and Bruce
Landon, MD -- tracked 22,830 matched-pair Medicare patients between 2001 and
2004 with follow-up in 2005.

"We applaud these researchers for undertaking a comparative study that points to
important advantages of minimally invasive AAA repair over open surgery beyond
the generally accepted benefits of reductions in perioperative mortality and
morbidity," said Paul McCormick, president/CEO of Endologix (Irvine,
California). "These differences confer significant clinical and economic
benefits for the endovascular option and support our conviction that
endovascular repair is on the way to becoming the standard of care for AAA
repair."

Endologix developed the Powerlink system endoluminal stent graft for the
treatment of AAA.

While short-term results of the NEJM study favored the endovascular approach,
long-term advantages were less clear. The endovascular approach avoids the
laparotomy-related complications of open surgical repair, but the study suggests
that the less invasive approach is associated with a higher risk for problems
related to the aneurysm repair.

Still, McCormick told Medical Device Daily that the risks associated with open
surgical repair of AAA - in particular, laparotomy-related complications and
risk of bowel obstruction or abdominal wall hernia - are greater than the
long-term risks of endovascular repair.

"The real measure of a technology would be the rate of aneurysm-related death --
that's what you're treating," McCormick told MDD. Because patients with AAA are
usually older and sicker with more serious co-morbidities, "total mortality is
probably not a good measure of anything," he added.

AAA is a weakening of the wall of the aorta, the largest artery in the body,
resulting in a balloon-like enlargement. Once AAA develops, it continues to
enlarge and, if left untreated, becomes increasingly susceptible to rupture.

According to an article in Journal Watch Cardiology citing the NEJM study,
endovascular approaches for AAA surgery were introduced in 1991 and now account
for more than 40% of elective repairs.

During an endovascular repair procedure, the physician makes two small incisions
in the groin and threads two catheters through the patient's arteries. Once in
place in the weakened section of the aorta, the catheters release a tubular
device comprised of large z-shaped metal stents sewn to surgical graft material
that expands to channel blood through the aorta and reduce the pressure on the
aneurysmal sac, lessening the risk of rupture.

Cook Medical (Bloomington, Indiana) reported similar results in a recent
two-year clinical study evaluating its Zenith AAA endovascular graft, an
endovascular aneurysm repair device used to treat AAAs, in 430 patients at 15
health centers throughout the U.S. Cook's study indicated a 98.9% rate of
survival at 30 days for standard and high medical risk AAA patients following
endovascular repair and 97.5% for standard risk patients who underwent open
surgery. Freedom from AAA-related mortality was high for endovascular repair
patients through two years, with 98.9% AAA-related survival of standard-risk
patients and 93.8% for high-risk patients, Cook said.

"Both the data generated from the New England Journal of Medicine study and the
results from our clinical study further reinforce that [endovascular aneurysm
repair] is the favorable choice for patients in need of AAA repair," said Barry
Thomas, VP of Cook's Aortic Intervention business.

In November, Cook launched its 36mm diameter Cook Zenith Renu AAA ancillary
graft (Medical Device Daily, Nov. 15, 2007). The graft is designed for secondary
endovascular intervention in patients who received prior endovascular repair of
infrarenal AAA. The graft is specifically intended to treat AAA patients whose
implanted stent-grafts may have shifted, Cook noted. The company reported FDA
approval for the graft in 2006 (MDD, Oct. 31, 2006).

Another competitor in this space is Medtronic (Minneapolis). Earlier this year
Medtronic reported the U.S. market launch of its AneuRx AAAdvantage stent graft
on its new Xcelerant hydro delivery system, which features a hydrophilic coating
designed to aid navigation of the device through tight and tortuous arteries by
reducing friction with the artery wall (MDD, Jan. 14, 2008).

Medtronic received FDA approval of its AneuRx AAAdvantage stent graft with
Xcelerant delivery system in 2006 (MDD, March 29, 2006).

The AAA market is expected to soar, according to the Millennium Research Group
(MRG; Waltham, Massachusetts). Its analysis last year of the peripheral vascular
device market found that the second largest segment of the market, AAA repair
via stent grafts, was valued at $300 million in 2006 and would grow at a
compound rate of about 13% annually over the next five years, resulting in a
total market value of about $550 million by 2011 (MDD, March 9, 2007).

MRG said that a program initiated by Medicare called Screening Abdominal Aortic
Aneurysms Very Efficiently (SAAAVE) Act would have a significant impact on the
growth of AAA procedures over the next five years.

Last year Medicare began offering free, one-time ultrasound screening benefits
to check for AAA in qualified seniors. The initiative covers men ages 65-75 with
a history of smoking, and men and women in the same age bracket with a family
history of AAA (MDD, Jan. 12, 2007).

Angiotech in agreement to buy Edwards' Lifespan line for $14M

A Medical Device Daily Staff Report

Angiotech Pharmaceuticals (Vancouver, British Columbia) reported yesterday that
it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the Lifespan ePTFE (Laguna
Hills, California) vascular graft business from Edwards Lifesciences (Irvine,
California) for $14 million in cash.

The transaction is subject to approval from Edwards Lifesciences' board of
directors.

The agreement includes a distribution arrangement with Edwards, in which that
company will retain certain rights to distribute the existing Lifespan product
line globally for a period of up to five years as well as become the exclusive
distributor of Angiotech's Vascular Wrap paclitaxel-eluting mesh products as
packaged in combination with the Lifespan vascular graft products in the EU for
a period of up to three years following regulatory approval.

Angiotech has the right at any time to exercise co-distribution rights to the
stand-alone Lifespan product line in the U.S., and also can co-distribute the
stand-alone products in the EU after a period of three years. Angiotech has
retained all distribution rights with respect to Vascular Wrap products packaged
in combination with ePTFE vascular grafts in the U.S., and with respect to any
stand-alone Vascular Wrap products worldwide.

The Edwards Lifespan ePTFE product line has more than 75 product iterations and
includes vascular grafts of various sizes and lengths. Edwards' distribution
network for the products includes a full-line vascular sales force numbering
more than 20 direct sales representatives in both the U.S. and Europe
supplemented by a number of independent distributors.

"Our transaction and partnership with Edwards significantly enhances the
financial potential of Angiotech's Vascular Wrap product development program for
an investment of $14 million," said Tom Bailey, vice president, business
development at Angiotech. "In a single step, we have secured a near-term
distribution relationship for our Vascular Wrap product in the European Union as
well as an additional future revenue opportunity for Angiotech, as we now can
potentially generate revenue from the direct sale by Angiotech of ePTFE vascular
grafts as well as our Vascular Wrap product, should our product development
efforts prove successful."

He added that the deal is a non-dilutive transaction, with the operation
expected to be a positive contributor to the company's cash flow and earnings
while it conducts clinical studies and pursues various regulatory approvals for
the Vascular Wrap product.

The companies said that over the last 20 years, ePTFE has become the "gold
standard" for synthetic vascular grafts. Despite these improvements, Angiotech
said today's patency rates leave room for improvement, which is its goal for the
paclitaxel-eluting Vascular Wrap product currently in clinical trials.

The deal is slated for completion in 4Q05.

Surge Medical Solutions (SMS; Grand Rapids, Michigan) reported that it has
acquired the arrested-heart products division of Chase Medical (Richardson,
Texas), a manufacturer of products that treat heart failure and coronary artery
disease. Financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed.

SMS was established in March (Medical Device Daily, April 4, 2005) as a joint
venture between Cascade Engineering (also Grand Rapids), a company that
engineers plastics systems and components, and Surge Medical (Holland,
Michigan), a developer of products for the cardiovascular surgery, emergency
services and medical accessories markets.

SMS said the acquisition of Chase Medical's arrested-heart products division
accelerates its efforts to provide innovative cardiovascular medical devices and
accessories to heart surgeons worldwide.

SMS will acquire a substantial portfolio of cardiovascular surgical tools and
accessories, and an extensive network of distribution relationships both
domestically and abroad. As part of the acquisition, Chase Medical's
arrested-heart manufacturing operations will transfer from Richardson, Texas, to
Cascade Engineering's campus in Grand Rapids.

"This acquisition is a strategically important leap forward for our company,"
said Ron DeVries, president of SMS. "The addition of Chase Medical's
well-established arrested heart products division will significantly expand our
existing product portfolio and new product development capabilities, bolster our
sales and distribution channel, and further our mission to improve surgical
products and enhance patient outcomes."

In other dealmaking news:

·Coherent (Santa Clara, California) reported that it has signed a definitive
purchase agreement to acquire the assets of privately held Iolon (San Jose,
California) in an all cash transaction of about $5 million.

Prior to the asset sale, Iolon developed optical components including widely
tunable lasers and filters.

Coherent said it intends to use the acquired technology in its core portfolio,
especially for products in the instrumentation and display markets. The physical
assets will be transferred to Coherent's existing facilities in Santa Clara.

"In order to enable broader markets for photonics, it is essential that we
further improve the robustness of our products, while reducing their size and
cost," said John Ambroseo, president and CEO of Coherent. "We believe that the
technology and intellectual property that we have acquired from Iolon will
assist us in achieving these objectives."

Coherent provides photonics-based solutions to the commercial and scientific
research markets.

· PSS World Medical (Jacksonville, Florida) reported that it has acquired
Clinical Support Services (CSS), a California-based medical billing and recovery
services company offering services to facilities-based healthcare providers in
California.

As part of the company's Elder Care Business, CSS will continue to focus on
growth of its medical billing services programs within California and will be
integrated into the Part B billing operations based in Tennessee.

The company noted that the acquisition was financed from existing borrowing
capacity, though terms of the transaction were not disclosed.

PSS World Medical is a national distributor of medical products to physicians
and elder care providers.

PLATE BY PLATE, AN ELEGANT MEAL COMES TOGETHER AT GRAFT;
FOOD & DRINK;
RESTAURANT REVIEW

BYLINE:  by LINDSAY CHRISTIANS

SECTION: THE CAP TIMES; Pg. 29

LENGTH: 1123 words


With the near-simultaneous arrival downtown of Graft, Hamilton's on the Square
and Estrellon, small plates have finally conquered Madison.

Adapted from tapas (which Estrellon serves in earnest), the small plates trend
is one Midwestern chefs have embraced slowly since it started gaining national
traction more than a decade ago.

It's an entertaining way to eat, if usually more expensive than one expects. As
restaurant critic Pete Wells wrote in last week's New York Times, the
almost-tapas style "has spread far and wide, leaving in its wake a trail of
cluttered tables, unpredictably sequenced dishes, and diners reduced to asking
pathetically, ?Will that be enough food?'" Graft, an ambitious new restaurant
that opened in mid-July at 18 N. Carroll St., has some of that to answer for.
The restaurant serves beautifully plated, smartly composed dishes, though
despite fawning service, their order and (slow) pace still needs attention.

And for better or worse, those plates are really, truly small.

A play on cheese curds ($6) was three dainty nuggets of fried chevre, sprinkled
with pepper and drizzled in sherry vinegar caramel sauce. Briny sea scallops
with fennel and grapefruit ($15), succulent and flawlessly cooked, came three to
a plate. Divide carefully.

With few exceptions, these weren't plates that more than two people could easily
split. Depending on how one feels about sharing very tasty things (spoiler: I am
for it), that could be good or bad.

Take the grits with a fried egg ($8). Like breakfast for dinner, the punctured
yolk ran past wilted leaves of kale into creamy, buttery cornmeal. It was so
simple, so decadent, an appetizer for one.It would be worth ordering two of
Graft's perfectly seared chicken thigh plates ($9), served on bright green
Israeli couscous and offset by shards of fried chicken skin. Dabs of apricot
puree on top looked like tiny egg yolks. It was an understated dish, subtle
enough to pair with a crisp, citrusy white.

Because each dish is meant to pair with wine, chef Phillip Rodriguez focuses on
subtle flavors?rice chips that dissolve in your mouth like cotton candy, tiny
yellow broccoli flowers, willowy fennel fronds, nasturtium leaves.

Rodriguez's puck-shaped tuna tartare ($13), dotted with sesame seeds and nubbins
of cucumber, was meaty enough to go either with a glass of bracing white Godello
(2012 A. Coroa, $10) or a light red.

The same was true of a cute little jar of smoky trout rillettes ($14), summery
and light with addition of creme fraiche. Get extra bread, and it's an app for
two. Graft "mac and cheese" ($7) offered about six delicious bites of buttermilk
spaetzle baked in a twee miniature cast iron skillet. A little creative yet
familiar, it's one of the few dishes Graft will likely not rotate off the menu
as autumn ingredients displace tomatoes and summer squash.

Among more substantial dishes, melted raclette beneath a jumble of "al dente"
broccolini ($7) was so delicate it felt whipped, set off by sweet raisins and
toasted hazelnuts.

Pheasant ($19), on one of three "large" plates, had a hard, golden outside sear,
set off by mild celery root puree and chunks of kohlrabi, with their mild
cabbagey flavor.

For the biggest dish of all, Graft does a wonderful medium rare rib-eye steak
($34). In late summer, it came layered over thin strips of zucchini and a thin
horseradish aioli with just a hint of heat, topped with fingerling potatoes.
Steer hearty eaters this way, and they'll be more than satisfied.

One happy side effect of small plates is that when a dish .

fails, it matters that much less. So, sure, the bread plate ($3) was boring.
Heirloom tomatoes with cantaloupe and arugula ($8), though incredibly gorgeous,
needed some acidity for lift.

Don't dawdle, then; just move on to the next thing.

Maybe make that thing pork belly ($11) in a sweet soy glaze, with potatoes,
tender fall asparagus and mustard. No one will judge if you make it a lovely
little dinner, paired with a few glasses of pinot noir ($12-18 glass) or an
aromatic, lightly sweet rum cocktail (By Any Other Name, $11).

Another benefit of the small plates style is you'll almost certainly have room
for dessert. Co-owner Erin Bemis' financier with strawberries and cream ($8)
made for a sweet, buttery conclusion, as did her delicate, well-balanced lemon
cream ($8).

Graft is co-owned by Lucas Henning, a gregarious sommelier who will be happy to
find you a great wine you've never heard of. Bemis, Henning's wife, makes the
desserts. The third owner is Sam McDaniel, also a sommelier.

Drawn from their love of grapes (that's where the name comes from, "grafting"
vines), the wine list at Graft is substantial. Prices are accessible?many
glasses fall in the $7-$10 range, with lots of bottles less than $50 ? and there
are interesting finds, notably in Germany and Italy. The list is currently a bit
stronger on the white side than red, something that may change as the leaves do.

While summer lingers, don't miss the 2014 Donnhoff Estate Riesling ($10), a
juicy, elegant white with a dry finish, or a glass of barely sweet non-vintage
Domaine Collin Crmant de Limoux bubbles ($10). Or make like you're at Merchant
and roll the dice. When I asked Henning to bring me whatever white he found most
interesting at the moment, he brought over a blend I'd never heard of, made from
a mix of Viennese field grapes.

It's a mouthful, but if you can remember the 2013 Wiener Gemischter Satz from
Stift Klosterneuberg ($9), grab a glass ? it's fresh and full of stone fruit
flavors.

Designed as a wine bar within a restaurant, Graft wasn't originally going to
have much in the way of liquor. That changed when the team brought on Scott
Anderson, whose resume includes L'Etoile's stylish, experiment-friendly bar.

Over several visits, cocktail after cocktail showed Anderson's gift for
balancing sweet, smoke, acid and bitter. The Bracht Show ($11), for one, brought
out the smokiness of rye on the end of the cocktail, offset by lemon, house-made
raspberry syrup and Cynar, a bitter amaro liqueur.

Graft's long and narrow spaces, formerly a clothing store and J. Taylor's
antiques, are quite beautiful, with brick floors, low lighting and a reclaimed
barn door separating two dining areas. The soundtrack, like an Amy Winehouse
vinyl album played on Graft's record player, gives a boost of energy without
skewing the vibe too young (read: college age).

Ultimately, Graft feels like the kind of place a couple might go on a date or
before a show. He can show off his knowledge of Willamette Valley pinot and she
won't have to share her scallops.

There are only three. No shame in hoarding them.

Scandal raises red flags in Rio;
President, party under fire; will graft probe affect Games?

BYLINE: Taylor Barnes, Special for USA TODAY Sports

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 3C

LENGTH: 656 words


Opposition to the ruling Workers' Party is reaching a fever pitch as
demonstrators take to Brazil's streets to pressure the government, with many
citizens exasperated by a graft scandal unfolding at the state oil company and a
tanking economy.

The movement is putting  beleaguered President Dilma Rousseff on the defensive,
and she quickly responded to the protests with a series of anti-corruption
proposals announced Wednesday. It also raises red flags on how the scandal could
affect preparations for the first Olympics in South America, to be held in 17
months.

The graft scandal, which has been investigated over the last year and involves
allegations of hundreds of millions in kickbacks from contractors of the state
oil company to the ruling party, is putting the Workers' Party in the most
serious political crisis in its 12 years in the presidency.

Rousseff's disapproval rate among Brazilians is the highest of any president
since 1992, when  Fernando Collor was impeached for corruption charges.

"We don't want this promiscuity between businesses and government," Edna
Theodoro, 59, a lawyer, said at a protest last week. Similar demonstrations
under the banner of "Impeachment for Dilma" brought hundreds of thousands to the
streets that day, reportedly in more than a hundred cities. Theodoro referred to
the contractors cited in the investigations, dubbed the Car Wash Operation by
police, as sharks.

The investigations have implicated six companies that are  responsible for the
majority of infrastructure projects for the  2016 Olympics.  Among the projects
they are responsible for are the Olympic Park, the  athletes village and
transportation and sanitation projects related to the Games.

The Car Wash Operation has named more than 50 current and former politicians,
many in the close circle of President Rousseff.

The criminal investigation and a parallel inquiry by Brazil's comptroller
general could imperil many companies' access to credit and their ability to
receive government contracts.

Contracts among six companies cited in the Car Wash probe tally a reported 27
billion reais (approximately $9 billion), about three-quarters of the budget for
Olympic infrastructure and related projects.

The companies are being hit hard in the investigations. For example, a former
Petrobras manager testified that Andrade Gutierrez -- responsible for pollution
projects in the region of the Olympic Park -- paid bribes worth about $4 billion
in contracts from the oil company.

In February, two executives from Camargo Corrêa, which is involved in two public
transportation projects linked to the  Games, signed plea bargains with the
government and became cooperating witnesses.

In response to requests for comments, Olympic contractors OAS Construction,
Queiroz Galvão and Andrade Gutierrez expressed confidence in the companies'
abilities to carry out their projects for 2016 and said that work continued on
schedule.

Brazilians have expressed a multitude of grievances on the streets -- from
complaints over the poor quality of public schools and hospitals to exasperation
with pricey public bus fares -- since nationwide protests alarmed the government
in  2013.

But some say the outrage over the Car Wash investigation is misguided.
Corruption is not new and  not just in Petrobras, said João Roberto Lopes Pinto,
a professor at UniRio and coordinator of an institute that researches the rise
of Brazil's largest companies.

He said many on Brazil's left are avoiding what they see as an opportunistic
movement to focus only on the Workers' Party and not a series of companies whose
relationships with the Brazilian government date  to the 1964-85 military
dictatorship.

"What the Car Wash Operation presents us are  strong denunciations of the
institutionalization of this cartel. It's not just an episodic thing," Pinto
said.

"It seems to confirm many of our suspicions about the cartel-style way that many
of these enterprises act."

Cook's latest generation AAA endograft cleared for sale by FDA

Cook's latest generation AAA endograft cleared for sale by FDA

By HOLLAND JOHNSON  Medical Device Daily Associate Managing Editor  In a
regulatory move that privately held device maker Cook (Bloomington, Indiana)
said "further solidifies its technological leadership in designing highly
advanced endografts for treating aortic aneurysms," the FDA has cleared its
next-generation Zenith Flex AAA Endovascular Graft for U.S. distribution.
Additionally the company also released two-year data on the original Zenith
device, which was cleared by the FDA last year.

"The Zenith Flex design represents what we believe is the most technologically
advanced endograft for abdominal aortic aneurysms [AAA] approved for commercial
distribution in the U.S.," said Barry Thomas, global leader of Cook's
endovascular therapies division. "We're thrilled to have FDA approval for our
next-generation Zenith Flex AAA endograft, and look forward to introducing it to
the U.S. market shortly."

According to the company, the Zenith Flex AAA graft system features several
significant innovations over the previous iteration of the Zenith device
originally approved for sale in the U.S. in May 2003. These advanced features,
Thomas said, include more widely spaced stent bodies to allow the device to
conform to tortuous anatomy. The new design also decreases the Zenith FLEX
stent-graft's kink radius by 40% to 68%, allowing the device to bend around
tighter turns in the aorta with less chance of kinking.

Before market launch of the new Zenith endograft, the company said it is waiting
to receive FDA clearance on a new, more advanced delivery system that takes full
advantage of the endograft's advanced features. The next-generation H&L-B One
Shot delivery system features Cook's new Captor Hemostatic Valve to inhibit
blood reflux and air aspiration. It also features a Flexor introducer that uses
a unique sheath construction to combine optimal flexibility with maximum
resistance to sheath kinking or compression.

The company also is developing what it termed a "potent" portfolio of new aortic
endovascular therapies using the Zenith's patented Z-stent endograft design.

According to Thomas, the company is in U.S. clinical trials with the Zenith TX2
endograft designed to treat aneurysms in the descending thoracic aorta. Other
new devices in development include endografts for use in emergency cases where
the aneurysm has already ruptured; and fenestrated and branch vessel versions of
the Zenith device to treat more complicated aneurysm cases.

The company also reported the release of two-year U.S. data on the original
Zenith device over the weekend at the Society for Vascular Surgery's (Chicago,
Illinois) 2004 Annual Endovascular Meeting, held in Anaheim, California, that it
said confirms the early results of the device.

Patients treated for AAA with the device achieved a 97.7% AAA survival rate, had
no aneurysm ruptures occurring in the second year of follow-up and experienced
few complications from the device after two years.

The company said the two-year U.S. findings confirm earlier clinical trial data
showing that AAA patients receiving the Zenith AAA endograft achieved remarkable
results in the areas of stent migration, endoleaks and aneurysm shrinkage. These
three measurements, the company said, are the most important performance
indicators for endovascular grafts. Specifically, after the second year of a
15-center, 352-patient clinical trial, data for the Zenith AAA Endovascular
Graft showed 0% stent migration (equal to or greater than 10 mm) in both
standard and high-risk patients.

The data also showed that endoleaks of any type occurred in only 7.5% of all
patients, and in only 6.9% of standard risk patients, a comparable rate to
first-year data.

Also of importance, the diameter of aneurysms remained unchanged or decreased
for 97.4% of all patients, and in 100% of Zenith patients without endoleaks or
systemic infection.

"These findings, coupled with the long-term experience of physicians in Europe,
Australia and other countries, clearly demonstrate Zenith's constant and stable
performance," noted Thomas. "We expect the long-term rates of endoleaks,
migration and aneurysm sac shrinkage to achieve this same level of success well
into the future," he added.

·Advanced Magnetics (Cambridge, Massachusetts) has received an initial action
letter from the FDA regarding the company's Combidex contrast agent for Magnetic
Resonance Imaging (MRI). The FDA said it considers Combidex to be approvable for
its principal indication as a lymph node imaging agent. The agency found the use
of Combidex for its secondary indication, the imaging of the liver and spleen,
not approvable at this time and labeling has been deferred. Final approval by
the FDA of the Combidex new drug application is subject various conditions
specified by the FDA. Advanced Magnetics said it will be able to resolve the
questions raised by the FDA. Advanced Magnetics develops products for the
diagnosis of cancer and other diseases.

·Angiosonics (Morrisville, North Carolina) has begun two multicenter
cardiovascular clinical studies in Europe: the TURBO Trial (The Ultrasound
Removal of Blood ClOts in VeinGrafts) and the Acolysis for Acute Myocardial
Infarction Trial (a European ATLAS Registry). Both studies will assess the
benefits of ultrasound thrombolysis for coronary indications using the Acolysis
System. Their results, according to the company, will support data already
collected from two European studies. Reports of past experience with the
Acolysis System for coronary syndromes indicate that ultrasound thrombolysis
provides complete clot dissolution while controlling distal embolization.
Angiosonics makes therapeutic ultrasound technologies for a variety of
indications.

·Cardima (Fremont, California) said that, based on results of its Phase I and
Phase II studies of its Revelation Tx microcatheter system, the FDA has approved
initiation of a Phase III of an ongoing trial to treat paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation. Up to 128 additional patients may be enrolled in the study, at 15
sites. To date 47 patients have been treated at nine centers in Phase I and
Phase II.

·CardioTech International (Woburn, Massachusetts) has started its preclinical
evaluation of a radioactive sleeve that reduce or eliminates scar tissue
(anastomotic hyperplasia) that forms around implanted synthetic coronary artery
grafts and the aorta. The sleeves are being implanted in experimental animals
for periods of up to six weeks. The preclinical study is being conducted by
CardioTech, Implant Sciences and Stanford University Medical Center, with
funding coming from a government grant. Bypass graft surgery using saphenous
veins from the patient is limited because of long-term failure due to
anastomotic hyperplasia. Synthetic grafts suffer from a similar failure.
CardioTech's thin, bioresorbable polymer sleeve contains radioactive phosphorous
to deliver a continuous radiation at the anastomosis for inhibition of
hyperplasia. CardioTech also said it has received a U.S. patent titled
"Hydrophilic and Hydrophobic Polyether Polyurethanes and Uses Therefor,"
covering amphiphilic polymers used for controlled delivery systems.

·Carrington Laboratories (Irving, Texas) has received FDA marketing approval for
a sterile preservative-free hydrogel containing acemannan hydrogel. Expected to
be launched by Sept. 15, the product will be marketed under the name Ultrex and
was specifically formulated for unit-dose use and patients with sensitive skin.
The Ultrex preservative-free gel is indicated for managing pressure and stasis
ulcers, post- surgical incisions, first- and second-degree burns and skin
conditions associated with peristomal care.

·Meridian Medical Technologies (Columbia, Maryland) reported receiving a U.S.
patent, including 18 claims, for a key element of its Prime ECG electrocardiac
mapping system, which it said has been found in European studies to diagnose
heart attacks and related disorders earlier and with greater accuracy than a
traditional 12-lead ECG. The patent covers the Prime ECG disposable sensor
device allowing fast, anatomically correct placement of large numbers of
electrodes, the company said. Featuring 80 screen-printed electrodes on clear
plastic strips, the sensor device is placed around the torso to produce a more
complete diagnostic view of the electrical function of the heart. The company
says that the newly patented sensor unit can be rapidly and accurately
positioned on the body, regardless of body size and shape. The electrodes are
incorporated in a disposable vest of clear plastic strips, resulting in an
increased diagnostic detection area that records heart signals from 64 anterior
and 16 posterior sensors for a more complete view of the heart's electrical
activity.

·Chad Therapeutics (Chatsworth, California) a maker  of oxygen-conserving
devices and oxygen systems, received FDA marketing clearance for its Oxymatic
401 electronic oxygen conserver presented at the Medtrade West Exhibit, a trade
show for home care providers. The conserver is designed to extend the life of
portable and ambulatory oxygen systems. CHAD said it will begin initial
shipments in July.

·Integ (Saint Paul, Minnesota) discussed at its annual shareholders meeting
results of several clinical studies using the company's LifeGuide System, a
glucose monitor in development. Integ said it has conducted two groups of
clinical trials using the clinical LifeGuide System. The studies confirmed that
patients can obtain an interstitial fluid (ISF) sample and valid test results in
a high percentage of attempts. They also confirmed that the LifeGuide prototype
measures glucose in ISF accurately and precisely, providing clinically relevant
results under routine patient conditions. Test results improve if a 15-minute
average lag time between blood and ISF measurements is considered.

   Wright Medical Group, Inc., incorporated on November 23, 1999, is a global
specialty orthopaedic company. The Company through Wright Medical Technology,
Inc. (WMT) and other subsidiaries provides extremity and biologic solutions that
enable clinicians to alleviate pain and restore the patients'  lifestyles. The
Company operates through three segments: U.S., International and BioMimetic. Its
business includes products that are used in foot and ankle repair, upper
extremity products and biologics products, which are used to replace damaged or
diseased bone, to stimulate bone growth and to provide other biological
solutions for surgeons and patients. The Company' s products include extremity
hardware, foot and ankle hardware, upper extremity hardware and biologics.

   Extremity Hardware

   The Company offers extremity products for the foot and ankle and upper
extremities in markets across the world. The Company serves United States and
German markets for foot and ankle surgical products. Extremity hardware includes
implants and other devices to replace or reconstruct injured or diseased joints
and bones of the foot, ankle, hand, wrist, fingers, toes, elbow and shoulder. In
addition, the Company offers products in the upper extremity market, such as
radial head repair, finger joint replacements and intramedullary wrist fracture
implants.

   Foot and Ankle Hardware

   The Company' s CHARLOTTE foot and ankle system offers fixation products for
foot and ankle surgery and includes products. Its CHARLOTTE portfolio includes
the CLAW Compression plate, the locking compression plate designed for
corrective foot surgeries. The CLAW II Compression Plating system is the
third-generation system to expand its plate and screw offering by introducing
anatomic plates designed for fusions of the midfoot. The CLAW II Polyaxial
Compression Plating system incorporates variable-angle locking screw technology.
The DARCO foot and ankle plating systems were designed for reconstructive foot
and ankle surgery. The DARCO MFS and MRS plates were the implants to incorporate
fixed angle, locking screw technology into a fixation set for foot surgery. The
Company' s INBONE II total ankle system represents the third generation in ankle
replacement implants, utilizing intramedullary alignment mechanism for placement
of the implant.

   The Company' s ORTHOLOC 3Di plating system provides foot and ankle surgeons
with a line of plates and screws to address deformities of the foot and ankle.
This next generation system provides multiple screw options and includes its
ORTHOLOC 3Di polyaxial locking technology, which enables the surgeon to adjust
the screw trajectory to meet the anatomic requirements of the patient while
providing a strong locking construct to promote bone fixation. The ORTHOLOC 3Di
Ankle Fracture system is a single-tray ankle fracture solution designed to
address a range of fracture types. This system provides the surgeon with
multiple anatomically-contoured plates and a set of instrumentation. The
ORTHOLOC 3Di Reconstruction Plating system includes anatomical plates, screws
and specialized surgical instrumentation used for fracture fixation, osteotomies
and fusions of the foot. The ORTHOLOC 3Di Reconstruction System offers surgeons
a range of plate designs to address common procedures performed by foot and
ankle surgeons, including bunion reconstruction and fusions of the first toe.

   The Company' s PRO-TOE VO Hammertoe implant provides alternative surgical
solution for the deformity. The system arrives in the operating room as a
single, sterile-packed unit. The PRO-TOE VO System provides surgeons with a
range of implants to address the individual anatomic variations from patient to
patient. The Solana portfolio included the CrossCheck Plating System, MDI
Metatarsal Resurfacing Implant, and the TENFUSE PIP and TENFUSE Nail Allograft.
The BIOFOAM Wedge System is designed for corrective osteotomies of the foot. The
BIOFOAM Cancellous Titanium material provides an environment for bone in-growth
and sustained rigid fixation. BIOFOAM wedges are sized for bone corrective
procedures for treating patients with flatfoot deformity. The sterile BIOFOAM
wedges eliminate the risk of adverse immune response associated with traditional
allografts or the patient morbidity associated with autograft harvest - the
current standard of care for these procedures.

   The Company' s VALOR TTC fusion nail provides surgeons with a solution for
fusing the calcaneal, talar and tibial bones required in patients suffering from
severe ankle arthritis. In addition to the INBONE total ankle replacement
system, the VALOR fusion nail provides foot and ankle surgeons. Its SIDEKICK
line of external fixators is designed to facilitate compression or distraction
of bones in the foot from the outside in and in a minimally invasive manner. The
SALVATION limb salvage portfolio is designed to address the demands of midfoot
reconstruction. This portfolio focuses on treating cases, such as neuropathic
deformity requiring arthrodesis of the midfoot, with or without corrective
osteotomies. Other products in its foot and ankle portfolio include its BIOARCH
subtalar arthroereisis implant, its line of AM Surgical foot and ankle
endoscopic tissue release products, and its line of Swanson toe joints.

   Upper Extremity Hardware

   The Company' s EVOLVE modular radial head replacement prosthesis addresses
the need for modularity in the joint of the elbow. The EVOLVE modular radial
head device provides different combinations of heads and stems allowing the
surgeon to choose implant heads and stems to accommodate the unpredictable
anatomy of each patient. The smooth stem design allows for rotational motion at
the implant and bone interface and for radiocapitellar articulation. The EVOLVE
TRIAD system includes anatomically contoured radial head and radial neck plates
featuring the ORTHOLOC 3Di Polyaxial Locking Technology to enable optimal screw
placement. The Company' s product offering for repair of radial head fractures
include EVOLVE Elbow Plating System (EPS), line of Swanson finger joints,
MICRONAIL II intramedullary wrist fracture repair system and RAYHACK system.

   The Company' s EPS addresses fractures of the distal humerus and proximal
ulna, and consists of polished stainless steel. This system was designed to
match the patient anatomy to reduce the need for intra-operative bending while
providing a low profile design to minimize post-operative irritation. Its line
of Swanson finger joints is used in finger joint replacement for patients
suffering from rheumatoid arthritis of the hand. The Company' s MICRONAIL II
intramedullary wrist fracture repair system is a next-generation minimally
invasive treatment for distal radius fractures that provides immediate fracture
stabilization with minimal soft tissue disruption. Its RAYHACK system consists
of a series of precision cutting guides and procedure-specific plates for ulnar
and radial shortening procedures and the surgical treatment of radial malunions
and Keinbock' s Disease.

   Biologics

   The Company offers a range of biologic products that are used to support
treatment of damaged or diseased bone, tendons and soft tissues and other
biological solutions for surgeons and patients. These products focus on
supporting biological musculoskeletal repair by utilizing synthetic and human
tissue-based materials. It also offers a bone graft product incorporating
antibiotic delivery. The Company' s GRAFTJACKET matrix is a human-derived soft
tissue graft designed for augmentation of tendon and ligament repairs, such as
those of the rotator cuff in the shoulder and achilles tendon in the foot and
ankle. Its GRAFTJACKET matrix provides suture holding power for augmenting
challenging tendon and ligament repairs.

   The Company sells its PRO-DENSE injectable graft in the United States and
select international markets. PRO-DENSE injectable graft is a composite graft of
surgical grade calcium sulfate and calcium phosphate. FUSIONFLEX demineralized
moldable scaffold is a form of allograft demineralized bone and is designed for
use in conjunction with hardware in foot and ankle fusion procedures, as well as
other orthopaedic bone grafting applications. Its OSTEOSET bone graft substitute
is a synthetic bone graft substitute made of surgical grade calcium sulfate. It
offers surgeons the option of custom-molding their own beads in the operating
room using the OSTEOSET resorbable bead kit, which is available in mixable
powder form. The Company' s ALLOMATRIX injectable putty combines DBM with its
surgical grade calcium sulfate carrier. The combination provides injectable
putty with the osteoinductive properties of DBM, as well as exceptional handling
qualities.

   The Company offers ALLOMATRIX C bone graft putty, which includes the addition
of cancellous bone granules. Its ALLOMATRIX custom bone graft putty allows
surgeons to customize the amount of bone granules to add to the putty based on
its surgical application. In addition, the Company offers CANCELLO-PURE bone
wedge line, as well as the ALLOPURE allograft bone wedges, which offer surgeons
off-the-shelf, sterile grafts with appropriate handling characteristics. The
Augment product line is based on recombinant human platelet-derived growth
factor (rhPDGF-BB), a synthetic copy of one of the body' s healing agents.

Villafana goes for lucky seven

Manny Villafana is taking one more stab at the heart.

The legendary medical entrepreneur's latest venture is called Kips Bay Medical,
a startup company in Plymouth that's developing a mesh wrap to strengthen the
vein grafts used by doctors in heart bypass surgeries.

Kips Bay Medical is the seventh medical company the 69-year-old Villafana has
founded in the Twin Cities in more than 25 years. His first two efforts remain
towering figures on the local corporate landscape.

In 1972, Villafana created a pacemaker business that was later acquired by
pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly, spun out as Guidant Corp. and is now operated in
Arden Hills by Natick, Mass.-based Boston Scientific. In 1976, he created a
heart valve company in Little Canada called St. Jude Medical -- now one of the
largest publicly traded companies based in Minnesota in terms of market value.

Those two operations collectively employ about 5,000 people in Minnesota.

Kips Bay Medical is a much smaller operation. But the company is pursuing a
market that could be bigger, Villafana says, than any other he's sized up.

"There's a definite need to make heart surgery better," Villafana says. "I've
done it by making pacemakers better for the electrical part of the heart. I've
made valves better to control the flow of blood through the heart. And now, the
muscle of the heart needs better ways of feeding it, if it becomes occluded."

Villafana's latest device is meant to improve a common heart procedure called
coronary artery bypass surgery -- an operation that's known among doctors as
CABG, or "cabbage," for short.

In bypass surgery, doctors take a segment of healthy blood vessel from elsewhere
in the body and sew the graft into place so that blood can bypass a clogged
artery and flow easily to the heart. Patients need the procedure when arteries
carrying blood to the heart muscle have become so plugged with plaque that
patients suffer chest pains and even heart attacks.

When surgeons go looking to make a bypass graft, they first harvest material
from the "mammary artery," which can be detached from the chest wall. But once
they've used the artery, they often turn to the "saphenous vein" in the leg as
the source for subsequent grafts; many patients need doctors to bypass two or
more blockages during one surgery.

In terms of durability, mammary arteries usually create much better grafts than
do saphenous veins, Villafana says. Kips Bay Medical is developing a flexible
metal mesh that can be placed over vein grafts before they are sewn into place,
thereby giving those vessels more strength.

It's a goal that makes sense to Dr. Robert Emery, the director of cardiovascular
surgery at St. Joseph's Hospital in St. Paul. There are about 300,000 to 400,000
bypass surgeries in the U.S. each year, and about 80 percent of the operations
use saphenous veins, Emery said.

"The problem this addresses is huge," said Emery, who said he was given a small
amount of stock in Kips Bay Medical for early work advising the company. He has
used the mesh device in animal experiments.

Emery said he has elected not to invest further in Kips Bay Medical, adding that
his financial interest does not bias his judgment about the product, which is
called the eSVS Mesh. St. Joseph's Hospital hopes to be part of a forthcoming
clinical trial of the product, Emery said.

The Kips Bay Medical device isn't the first time Villafana has tried to create a
product that improves bypass surgery.

His sixth company, called CABG Medical, tried to develop artificial bypass
grafts that ultimately failed in a clinical trial. When CABG Medical shut down
in 2006, some investors cried foul after Villafana disclosed he would reap
millions from the liquidation plan while those who invested during an initial
public offering of stock and held their shares lost most of their stake.

"We tried to treat everyone as fairly as possible -- everyone had common shares,
no one had preferred shares," Villafana said of the shareholder-approved
shutdown.

Despite the failure, Villafana says the opportunity to improve bypass grafts is
too large not to try again with the mesh product, which initially was developed
by Fridley-based Medtronic. He said that surgeons performing bypass surgery use,
on average, about 3.3 grafts per patient.

"One of those is made from the internal mammary artery, which we're not going to
touch," Villafana says. "But the other 2.3 belong to me -- I want to own those."

The bypass surgery market isn't what it used to be. Many patients who used to
get the operation now are treated with devices known as stents in a less
invasive procedure called angioplasty.

But if Villafana's latest device is shown to work in clinical trials, it could
help turn the tide back a bit in favor of bypass surgery.

"This device may become another piece of armament for the surgeon to improve the
outcome of bypass surgery as compared to (angioplasty) and stents," he said.
"Time will tell."

Promise seen in grafts that grow

BYLINE: JOE CARLSON; STAFF WRITER, STAR TRIBUNE (Mpls.-St. Paul)

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. 1D

HIGHLIGHT: U team hopes device can replace defective arteries, eliminating the
need for multiple surgeries.


In a scientific first, biomedical researchers at the University of Minnesota
have implanted a section of dead blood vessel in an animal and then watched as
it turned into living tissue that grew along with the host's body for a year.

A team led by U professor Robert Tranquillo said the breakthrough, published
Tuesday, could be used to graft tiny sections of lab-grown blood vessels in
place of defective arteries in children. Since the grafts would be able to grow
inside kids' bodies just like normal tissue, they could eliminate risky and
expensive surgeries that kids with congenital heart defects face later in life.

Just as a pair of jeans doesn't fit a growing kid after a couple of years, a
blood-vessel graft made from plastic or cadaver tissue becomes too small over
time - unless it can grow along with the rest of the body. More than 1,000
children a year in the U.S. with heart defects could benefit from such a growing
graft.

The experimental work "is focusing, at least at first, on the individuals who
are going to get the most out of this device. And that is kids, because they
will be able to avoid multiple surgeries they would otherwise have to have down
the line," said Dr. Gwen Fischer, who wasn't involved in the research directly.

Fischer is director of Minnesota's Pediatric Device Innovation Consortium, which
granted Tranquillo's team $50,000 for the proof-of-concept project. She said
medical device companies locally and nationally have expressed interest in the
technology, particularly if it can be used with adults who would make up a more
robust market than would pediatric patients.

On Tuesday, Nature Communications, an offshoot of the journal Nature, published
the results from Tranquillo's yearlong experiments that used three young Dorset
lambs. Engineers found that after 50 weeks, all three implanted graft segments
grew into the expected natural curves, and their diameters and lengths increased
to the same degree that the adjacent, natural arteries grew in the same time.

None of the three experimental grafts showed signs of early failure from
calcification (tiny bits of bone in the graft) or an immune response that would
have caused rejection by the host's body.

Past work has already shown it is possible to grow a nonliving blood vessel in a
lab and then implant it in a human and have it function as a normal vessel
would. North Carolina-based Humacyte is running a clinical trial involving 350
people implanted with bioengineered human vessels used for renal replacement
therapy.

The work by Tranquillo's team is new for its growth potential.

"This is the first instance that we know of where a material has been shown to
be able to grow with a patient," Tranquillo said. "For the well-being of the
patient, and not to mention the cost involved, there could be really major
benefits if this material does in fact grow in a human. We've shown it in a
sheep, and we would hope that someday it would also be demonstrated in a
patient."

It's not clear when that would happen. Work is already underway to meet the
stringent "good manufacturing process" standards required of all medical
devices. Bioethics experts at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the U
would also have to sign off on any human clinical trial.

'Exciting' work

Yale University's Dr. Laura Niklason, founder of Humacyte, lauded the Tranquillo
team's paper as "exciting."

"I believe the data are compelling supporting growth of a conduit that starts
out nonliving, and then becomes populated with cells by the animal that turn it
into a living tissue that has growth potential," Niklason said. She noted the
study's small population size - just three animals - and the fact that the test
was a "low-pressure" application, rather than a higher-pressure adult blood
vessel in which the mechanical stresses would be greater.

To grow the vascular grafts, Tranquillo's team purchased sheep skin cells from a
lab in New Jersey, combined them with a blood protein and enzyme, and poured the
solution into a tubular mold. After two weeks in the mold and another five in a
bioreactor, the resulting organic tubes were washed with special detergents to
strip away all living cells and remove the possibility of rejection by the
donor's body.

The resulting tube-shaped conduits were made of nonliving extracellular matrix,
covered with microscopic holes where the former cells were removed. Though the
implanted tubes can carry blood from day one, the cells from the donor's body
populate the implant and allow it to grow like the natural tissue within it.

"For this study we made the tissue tubes from sheep cells and then removed the
cells," Tranquillo said. "We've also made these tissue tubes from human cells,
and we can remove the cells. Therefore we believe this would also be clinically
relevant, in the sense that we can then implant that into a human."

Dr. Tony Azakie, the chief of pediatric cardiac surgery at the U, said vascular
grafts that can grow represent a potential "game-changer" for his patients,
about 20 percent of whom are newborns, and another 20 percent are infants.

"I think it's great that it's happening at the University of Minnesota," Azakie
said, noting the university's long history in pioneering heart surgery
techniques and devices. "This is really the home of a number of medical device
innovations. There is a great medical device community ... in Minnesota."

Recall latest in recent string of problems for Boston Sci

Recall latest in recent string of problems for Boston Sci

By HOLLAND JOHNSON  Medical Device Daily Associate Managing Editor  It appears
that Guidant (Indianapolis) isn't the only large medical device company to incur
headache-inducing problems.

Joining the Extra-Strength Tylenol club is Boston Scientific (Natick,
Massachusetts), which has reported a flurry of recent legal and regulatory
problems of its own, though perhaps not as serious as those of its
aforementioned competitor.

Boston Scientific reported late on Monday that it is voluntarily recalling all
of its Hemashield Vantage vascular grafts, which are used in peripheral
procedures.

The company said it is recalling all of the devices manufactured in the last two
years due to the potential of the device to fray or tear during suturing and the
possibility that it could lead to post-operative complications.

The total number of devices shipped but not yet implanted is estimated to be
around 500, with the company saying it ships about 2,180 Hemashield Vantage
vascular grafts per year. It posted $1.2 million revenue from the product in
2004 and the affected products were distributed to hospitals worldwide.

A company spokesperson told Medical Device Daily that a figure of 3,860 devices
already implanted in that two-year time frame is "pretty accurate."

To the spokesperson's knowledge, one would generally know within three days to a
week of implant whether the device will have problems, not the kind of long-term
issues associated with implantable cardioverter defibrillators like Guidant is
currently having. "You would know pretty quickly," if there is a problem, he
said, adding that "these grafts become integrated with surrounding tissue,
greatly mitigating the risk of failure over time."

This latest news comes close on the heels of last week's announcement by the
company that it agreed to pay $74 million to settle a Department of Justice
investigation of its 1998 recall of nearly 35,000 NIR ON Ranger with Sox
coronary stent systems that the government alleged continued to be sold for
nearly two months despite defects in the device used to implant them. It did not
admit wrongdoing as part of the settlement of a civil complaint that followed a
criminal probe which stretched for more than six years.

The $74 million settlement total exceeds the $61 million in revenue the company
gained from selling the stent from Aug. 12, 1998, until Oct. 5, 1998,
prosecutors said. On a positive note, the settlement does serve to eliminate a
potential legal overhang for the company.

In other recent legal news with a not-so-clear outcome, a U.S. District Court
jury in Wilmington, Delaware, last week found thatthe company's Taxus
drug-eluting stent and its Liberté and Express bare-metal stents infringed
Cordis' (Miami Lakes, Florida) Palmaz patent for balloon-expandable stents, and
that the bare-metal Liberté stent also infringes another Cordis patent - the
Gray patent - which relates to flexible balloon expandable stents and expires in
2016.

A new jury is scheduled to convene in August for a trial to determine the amount
of damages owed to Cordis, a Johnson & Johnson (J&J; New Brunswick, New Jersey)
subsidiary, and whether the infringement was willful. If that jury finds willful
infringement, U.S. District Court Judge Sue Robinson can as much as triple the
damages judgment.

Analysts have said monetary damages in that trial could surpass $1 billion if
the company lost on appeal, but the appeals process could take several years.

Additionally, Boston Scientific received a warning letter last month from the
FDA citing "serious regulatory problems" at the company's Watertown,
Massachusetts, manufacturing facility specifically involving the manufacturing
of its Vaxcel implantable low perfusion ports.

According to the warning letter, the inspection revealed that the methods or
facilities used for making, packing, storing or installing the products don't
conform with the current good manufacturing practice requirements for medical
devices.

Problems included failure to establish adequate management controls to ensure
that an effective quality system has been established and maintained, the letter
indicated.

The FDA said the company must promptly initiate "permanent corrective and
preventive action."

It appears that these recent problems, while not individually considered mortal
blows, have combined to negatively impact Boston Scientific's share value, with
the stock trading recently at $27.52 a share, nearly $14 below an analysts'
consensus one-year target estimate of $41.47 a share and close to the 52-week
low of $26.50.

In the latest action, the company said it is aware of three reported
post-operative failures that occurred between three and seven days
post-procedure for recipients of its vascular grafts. In all of these cases, it
said the patients were successfully treated by re-suturing the graft or
replacing it.

Boston Scientific said it is working with the FDA and is notifying officials in
other countries. It initiated the recall after a review of complaint records and
analysis of product revealed the potential problem. It is notifying hospitals
through detailed recall packages, including instructions on how to return
recalled product, as well as physician letters. All unimplanted product is to be
returned to the company.

Absent symptoms of graft failure, the company said it is recommending that
physicians continue "routine post-operative clinical evaluation." The signs and
symptoms that a Hemashield Vantage Vascular Graft might be starting to fail
include pain, swelling, bruising, bleeding through incision, rapid pulse or low
blood pressure.

FDA approves Titan Spine's Endoskeleton TL system for lateral spinal fusion

SECTION: ORTHOPEDIC DEVICES; Regulatory Approvals

LENGTH: 266 words



HIGHLIGHT: Titan Spine has obtained the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA)
approval to commercially launch its Endoskeleton TL system for lateral spinal
fusion.


According to Titan Spine, Endoskeleton TL is the first application of the
company's proprietary roughened titanium surface technology to the lateral
approach.

The roughened titanium surface technology has been shown to upregulate the
production of osteogenic and angiogenic factors that are critical for bone
growth and fusion.

The Endoskeleton TL system features large windows and large internal volumes to
allow for bone graft packing, clear CT and MRI imaging, desired bone graft
loading, and the ability to pack additional bone graft material within the
device following implantation.

First surgeries using the Endoskeleton TL has been performed by Salt Lake
Orthopaedic Clinic orthopedic spine surgeon Dr Kade Huntsman at St. Mark's
Hospital in Salt Lake City in July 2014.

Titan Spine chief medical officer Dr Paul Slosar said that the ability to
orchestrate cellular behavior and promote bone growth in response to an
interbody device has not been in the lateral surgeon's armamentarium until now.

"The TL is the byproduct of a unique collaboration between academic biomaterial
scientists, spine surgeons, and industry experts to create a truly
differentiated lateral interbody device that is designed to benefit both
patients and surgeons," Dr Slosar added.

"With the addition of the TL device, Titan Spine now offers its surface
technology and complete line of titanium devices for virtually all interbody
fusion spine surgery procedures in the cervical and lumbar spine."

Defendants challenge "junk-science" experts in med-mal suit

BYLINE: David Yates

LENGTH: 424 words


A man who alleges his skin graft became infected because the same needle was
used multiple times during a dialysis treatment will soon have to defend the
qualifications of the experts in his medical malpractice case.Lee (Pete) Gaspard
filed suit against Renal Care Group and nearly a dozen other medical
professionals in November 2006, alleging his care providers neglected to warn
him of the dangers of their "incompetent treatment."On March 1 defendants Dr.
Marisa Turner and Southeast Texas Nephrology Associates filed a motion
challenging the qualifications and opinions of Gespard's medical experts.Under
Chapter 74 of the Texas Civil Code, plaintiffs are required to submit a medical
expert report when filing a medical malpractice claim.Gaspard, a 57-year old man
with end-stage kidney disease and diabetes, went to Renal Care Clinic for
dialysis on Nov. 21, 2004. A nurse had to stick him several times with a needle
to initiate the treatment, court papers say."Mr. Gaspard alleges that his graft
became infected because (the nurse) used the same needle to prick him several
times, and that he started feeling sick the day when received multiple needle
sticks," the motion states."The crux of plaintiff's allegations ... is the graft
became infected when a dialysis nurse used unsterile techniques ... and that the
graft was not timely removed, which allowed bacteria ... to travel to Gaspard's
cervical spine (causing osteomyelitis to develop)." A graft is a vascular access
that connects an artery to a vein using a synthetic tube, or graft, implanted
under the skin of the arm.

The graft becomes an artificial vein that can be used repeatedly for needle
placement and blood access during dialysis.To substantiate his claims, Gaspard
submitted the expert reports of Dr. Juan Ayus, a nephrologist, and Dr. Jerrold
Dryer, who specializes in infectious disease."Neither Dr. Ayus nor Dr. Dryer
have shown that their opinions on liability ... are based on a reliable
foundation of scientific principle," the motion states. "Without such
foundation, their opinions amount to nothing more than junk science."A hearing
on the matter was slated to be held March 29 in Judge Milton Shuffield's 136th
District Court. However, the hearing was reset to April 7.Gaspard is suing for
his past and future mental anguish, lost wages and medical expenses.He is
represented in part by attorney Adam Terrell of the Weller, Green, Toups &
Terrell law firm.The defendants are represented by attorney Marion Kruse Jr. of
the Kruse Law Firm.Case No. D178-245

Joint anti-graft push needed, US delegates told

LENGTH: 429  words


China and the United States should seek consensus and deepen anti-graft
cooperation, top Party disciplinary chief Wang Qishan told a US bipartisan
delegation on Thursday in Beijing.

The call comes as China cracks down on corruption and improves its anti-graft
cooperation with the US, the top destination for Chinese officials accused of
corruption.

Wang, head of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, highlighted the
core role of the Party in China's development, and said that without discipline
it is impossible for the Party to realize the goal of leading people to build a
moderately prosperous society.

From Fox Hunt to Sky Net, China's campaigns to track down and extradite corrupt
officials have seen encouraging progress.

However, the absence of extradition treaties between China and the US has
hampered Beijing's efforts to bring more fugitives to justice.

According to the Foreign Ministry, Washington "does not seem ready" to sign such
a treaty with China as differences in social and legal systems mean that some
foreign judges have prejudices or an insufficient understanding of the Chinese
legal system.

Hong Kong-based media have reported that Wang may visit the US later this year,
and probably talk with his hosts about strengthening cooperation to track down
fugitives.

Former US trade representative Ron Kirk and former US secretary of veterans
affairs R. James Nicholson, who both led the delegation, called for greater
party-to-party communication and Sino-US cooperation.

The delegation was in China for the 8th China-US High-Level Political Party
Leaders Dialogue, which involved Democrats and Republicans discussing various
issues with the CPC.

For the first time, the dialogue included a China-US Entrepreneurs Roundtable.

Despite an end to China's decades of double-digit growth, those attending the
roundtable on Wednesday expressed optimism concerning growth and greater Sino-US
cooperation.

Bob Holden, chairman of the Midwest US-China Association and former governor of
Missouri, said the "new normal" is realistic.

"I think it's important for all of us outside of China to also work with China's
leadership to make sure that growth continues," he said.

The economy's new normal refers to the push for growth driven by domestic
consumption rather than exports and infrastructure.

Fan Bi, a senior official from the State Council Research Office, said China,
with a higher-quality economy, well-educated labor force and a sound industrial
system, remains an ideal destination for investment from developed countries.

LDR Secures Expanded Indication for ROI-C Cervical Cage

LENGTH: 644  words


Oct. 20 -- LDR Holding Corporation (Nasdaq:LDRH), a global medical device
company focused on designing and commercializing novel and proprietary surgical
technologies for the treatment of patients suffering from spine disorders, today
announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has cleared the ROI-C
Cervical Cage for use with allograft. Previously the device was cleared only for
use with autogenous bone graft.

The Indications for Use of the LDR ROI-C Cervical Cage have been expanded to
permit use with allograft. LDR presented comprehensive, clinical literature
review data to the FDA to investigate the risks and benefits associated with
using allogenic bone graft with ROI-C. The published clinical outcomes
demonstrated that the use of allograft (i.e., cancellous and/or
corticocancellous bone graft) in cervical interbody fusion devices to treat
patients diagnosed with cervical degenerative disc disease poses no new risks to
patients.

Dr. Darrell C. Brett, a neurosurgeon at Northwest Spine and Laser Surgery in
Portland, Oregon shared, "The addition of on-label clearance for the use of
allogenic bone graft in the ROI-C is a positive step in the FDA acknowledging
how the cage can best be used to treat well-indicated patients. I am pleased
that use of allograft is now a cleared application."

The ROI-C Cervical Cage System is indicated for use in skeletally mature
patients with degenerative disc disease of the cervical spine with accompanying
radicular symptoms at one disc level from C2-T1. The cage is to be used with
autogenous or allogenic bone graft. Supplemental internal fixation is required
to properly utilize this system. As specifically stated in the device
description in the cleared 510(k) Summary, VerteBRIDGE Plating can be inserted
to "obtain fixation to the vertebral bone and create a standalone cervical
interbody fusion cage construct."

"It is a positive step forward that this expanded indication for the stand-alone
ROI-C Cervical Cage reflects the common surgical practice of using allograft
bone in cervical cages to promote fusion," said LDR President and CEO Christophe
Lavigne. "For patients who may not be good candidates for disc replacement with
the Mobi-C Cervical Disc and therefore may turn to cervical fusion as an
alternative, the ROI-C is designed to be inserted via a minimally invasive,
direct access approach to the disc while avoiding the need for the traditional
cervical plate with four screws. In keeping with our Minimal Implant Volume
(MIVo) surgery philosophy, we believe that there is inherent benefit in
performing the least amount of surgery necessary and minimizing the implanted
materials required to achieve the desired outcome. This is very attractive to
both surgeons and patients."

Indications for Use: ROI-C Cervical Cage System

The LDR Spine ROI-C Cervical Cage System is indicated for use in skeletally
mature patients with degenerative disc disease (DDD) of the cervical spine with
accompanying radicular symptoms at one disc level from C2-T1. DDD is defined as
discogenic pain with degeneration of the disc confirmed by history and
radiographic studies. These patients should have had six weeks of non-operative
treatment. The LDR Spine ROI-C Cervical Cage System is to be used with
autogenous or allogenic bone graft composed of cancellous and/or
corticocancellous bone graft and placed via an open, anterior approach.
Supplemental internal fixation is required to properly utilize this system.

Device Description: ROI-C VerteBRIDGE Anchoring Plate

The ROI-C VerteBRIDGE anchoring plate, made of titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V) can be
inserted to obtain fixation to the vertebral bone and create a standalone
cervical interbody fusion cage construct. The anchoring plate locks securely in
place to the PEEK implant via locking tabs on either side of the anchoring
plate.

o Bruker (BIllerica, Massachusetts) reported the introduction of the CryoProbe
Prodigy. The broadband CryoProbe Prodigy uses nitrogen-cooled RF coils and
preamplifiers to deliver a sensitivity enhancement over room temperature (RT)
probes of a factor of 2-3x across the board for X-nuclei from 15N to 31P. The
sensitivity gain on the proton channel exceeds RT probe performance by a factor
of 2x or more. The CryoProbe Prodigy is compatible with Avance III NMR
spectrometers. The product is available at 400 and 500 MHz.

o Cerapedics (Westminster, Colorado) reported the results of a prospective,
randomized, controlled trial of its i-FACTOR biologic bone graft for patients
undergoing posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) spine procedures. The
objective of the study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Cerapedics'
novel i-FACTOR biologic bone graft compared to autologous bone delivered via
interbody fusion cages in single- and multi-level PLIF surgery. All patients
served as their own control and also received posterior pedicle screw
instrumentation. Outcomes included VAS for pain, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI)
and radiographic images. The occurrence of complications or adverse events was
also recorded. In addition to X-rays, the study utilized CT scans taken at
6-month and 1-year intervals. The company claims the i-FACTOR is the only
biologic bone graft that utilizes a small peptide as an attachment factor
intended to stimulate the natural bone healing process resulting in safe,
predictable bone formation at a fraction of the cost of growth factors.

o Ikaria (Clinton, New Jersey) reported the introduction of its next-generation
drug-delivery system, the Inomax DSIR, in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs)
within hospitals throughout the U.S. The Inomax DSIR is a drug-delivery system
that delivers the drug, Inomax (nitric oxide) for inhalation, the only drug
approved by the FDA to treat hypoxic respiratory failure (HRF) associated with
pulmonary hypertension in term and near-term infants, which includes infants
born at a gestational age of at least 34 weeks. HRF is a serious condition in
which blood vessels in the lungs constrict, making it difficult to oxygenate
blood. Inomax relaxes pulmonary blood vessels, improves oxygenation and treats
HRF in this delicate newborn population. The Inomax DSIR uses infrared
technology to link the device and cylinder allowing expanded informatics on use
of Inomax therapy. The Inomax DSIR is compatible with more than 45 makes of
ventilation devices and anesthesia machines to offer flexibility of use with
patients at many ventilator settings.

o MiMedx Group (Marietta, Georgia) reported the launch of the EpiFix, a biologic
implant specifically processed to offer a wide variety of wound healing and
wound care options. MiMedx reported that EpiFix is the wound care branded tissue
resulting from the company's Purion process. The amniotic tissue produced using
the Purion Process has generated a growing demand for minimally manipulated
allografts and has experienced increased growth in the areas of ophthalmology,
dental, spine and sports medicine.

o The FDA has cleared the SpectraShield (Silver Spring, Maryland) 9500 N95
surgical respirator, a device that kills 99.99% of three different kinds of
bacteria when exposed to its outer surface. The SpectraShield is cleared as a
single-use, N95 surgical respirator for use in healthcare settings by healthcare
personnel to protect against microorganisms, body fluids and particulate
material. Data from laboratory tests demonstrated that the respirator is
effective against the following bacteria: Streptococcus pyogenes,
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, also called MRSA, and Haemophilus
influenzae. N95 surgical respirators are different than regular facemasks, which
are designed to help block large-particle droplets, splashes, sprays, or
splatter that may contain viruses and bacteria from reaching the mouth and nose.
The N95 designation means that the respirator blocks at least 95% of very small
particles when subjected to careful testing. If properly fitted, the
capabilities of N95 respirators exceed those of regular facemasks.

Clinical Trial: Ridge Preservation With Platelet Rich Fibrin Augmented With
Freeze Dried Bone Allograft

LENGTH: 409 words

DATELINE: U.S.


U.S., Feb. 9 -- ClinicalTrials.gov registry received information related to the
study (NCT03043885) titled 'Ridge Preservation With Platelet Rich Fibrin
Augmented With Freeze Dried Bone Allograft' on Feb. 1.

Brief Summary: Improved predictability and quality of bone healing after a tooth
is removed is clinically relevant, in that, it improves our ability to achieve
successful implant placement at edentulous sites. Currently, a variety of
grafting materials and biologic agents are utilized clinically to improve bone
healing and provide sufficient dimensions of bone to support a dental implant.
Platelet rich fibrin (PRF) is one such product that can be used for this
application. PRF is a concentrated blood product attained from the patient's own
blood consisting of a natural bioscaffold with integrated growth factors capable
of sustained release. Once processed, PRF is implanted back into the patient at
the wound or defect site to encourage healing. The literature regarding PRF is
currently dominated by heterogeneous applications of PRF for reparative and
regenerative therapies without a consensus of its clinical efficacy and
appropriate application. In this clinical study, PRF will be evaluated to
ascertain its clinical efficacy in improving bone formation and alveolar
dimensional stability after tooth extraction. A classic bone grafting material
used for this purpose, freeze dried bone allograft (FDBA), will be incorporated
with the PRF or compared directly to PRF alone. It is hypothesized that the
natural scaffold and incorporated growth factors of PRF augmented with the
solubility resistance of FDBA will function as an ideal bioscaffold to promote
bone healing to a greater extent compared to PRF, FDBA, or blood clot alone.

Report from Europe: First five patients treated in TriVascular's OVATION trial

LENGTH: 924 words

A Medical Device Daily Staff Report

TriVascular (Santa Rosa, California) reported the successful treatment of the
first five patients in the OVATION study, a multicenter, prospective, European
Post Market Registry. The patients were treated in Germany at Stadtisches
Klinikum (Karlsruhe, Germany) by Martin Storck, MD, and at Universitares Herz
und Gefasszentrum (Hamburg, Germany) by Hans Krankenberg, MD.

"It is an honor to be the first site to enroll a patient in TriVascular's
OVATION study. Ovation's low-profile, 14F outer diameter design and sealing ring
technology show great promise in the treatment of AAA across a broad patient
population," said Storck, professor of vascular surgery, Stadtisches Klinikum.

This study, which will evaluate treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) in
the real-world setting of routine clinical practice, will enroll 500 patients at
30 sites in Europe. Matt Thompson, MD, professor of vascular surgery, St
George's Vascular Institute (London) is serving as the study's coordinating
investigator.

"Our participation in the original study gave us a very favorable view of
Ovation. Our first patients were treated over a year ago, with excellent
results. Through the OVATION study, we are pleased to continue our clinical
partnership with TriVascular and learn how Ovation performs in real-world
clinical practice," said Hans Krankenberg, MD, after enrolling four patients in
the registry.

Patients enrolled in the study will be treated with the Ovation abdominal stent
graft and followed for five years. The study's primary endpoint is treatment
success, a composite of technical and clinical success at 12 months. Technical
success includes successful delivery and deployment of the stent graft. Clinical
success includes freedom from aneurysm expansion, aneurysm rupture, type I and
III endoleak, conversion to open surgical repair, stent graft migration, and
stent graft occlusion.

The Ovation system was launched commercially in Europe in January 2011. At 14F
OD, Ovation is the lowest profile commercially available AAA device and is
designed to expand the pool of treatable patients by addressing a wider range of
diseased anatomies. In the U.S., Ovation is an investigational device and not
currently available for sale. Enrollment in the U.S. IDE study was completed in
March 2011.

KRAS diagnostic test receives CE Mark

Roche (Basel, Switzerland) reported that the cobas KRAS mutation test is now
commercially available in Europe for use in colorectal cancer.

The cobas KRAS Mutation test identifies mutations in the KRAS gene of colorectal
cancer tissue that are predictive of individual response to therapy with
anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibody therapies.

"By quickly and reliably detecting KRAS mutations, the cobas KRAS Mutation test
provides oncology professionals with a new, validated tool to help guide and
personalize treatment of colorectal cancer," said Paul Brown, head of Roche
Molecular Systems (RMS), the business area of Roche that developed the test.

KRAS mutations occur in 35% to 45% of colorectal cancers. The remaining tumors
(approximately 60%) have no KRAS mutations, and are referred to as KRAS wild
type. The cobas KRAS Mutation test was designed to detect KRAS mutations with
high sensitivity, which is important because of the safety issues of treating
mutation positive patients with anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody therapies. The
test detects mutations in codons 12, 13 and 61 of the KRAS gene.

There is strong evidence that tumor KRAS status is a predictive biomarker of
efficacy for EGFR-targeted monoclonal antibodies. Treatment with EGFR-targeted
monoclonal antibodies is beneficial in patients with KRAS wild-type colorectal
cancer, whereas it is not effective, or may even be detrimental, in patients
with KRAS mutations.

The cobas KRAS Mutation test is a TaqMelt, polymerase chain reaction-based
diagnostic test intended for the detection of mutations in codons 12, 13 and 61
of the KRAS gene.

MID FloShield system receives CE mark

Minimally Invasive Devices (MID; Columbus, Ohio) has been awarded the CE mark
for its FloShield laparoscopic visualization system.

The FloShield system provides for an uninterrupted clear view during
laparoscopic procedures. FloShield uses airflow from the insufflator to defog
and deflect debris from the lens of the laparoscope without removing the scope
from the abdominal cavity for cleaning. Surgeons have to interrupt surgery as
often as ten times per hour to remove the scope and manually clean it. FloShield
dramatically reduces, and often eliminates, interruptions to clean the lens.
FloShield is the only medical device that prevents optics from becoming
obscured.

"The advent of HD ten years ago was the last breakthrough in laparoscopic
vision," says Wayne Poll, MD, FloShield inventor and CEO of MID. "FloShield
represents the last hurdle in laparoscopic visualization."

The FloShield system, which received FDA approval in 2008, is in early
distribution within the U.S., and in use at about 40 hospitals throughout the
country. The system was certified ISO 13485 compliant in December of 2010,
clearing the path for CE marking.

Poll says the company has more than tripled employment over the last two years
from four full time employees to 14.

Funding for the company was led by the Ohio TechAngel Funds with additional
funding from three other Ohio-based angel funds including Queen City, NorthCoast
and ECOTAF. MID has received venture funding from Charter Life Sciences and
Reservoir Partners.

FINDINGS

SECTION: A SECTION; Pg. A07

LENGTH: 510 words


Three transplant patients contracted a dangerous parasitic disease from their
new organs in the first such documented cases in the United States, the
government said yesterday. Two of the three women died.

A second study also released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
turned up 26 bacterial infections traced to tissue grafts that had come from
cadavers in the United States.

The CDC said the graft-related infections show an urgent need to update federal
regulations and industry standards for preventing contamination.

In the report involving the parasitic disease, all of the organs came from the
cadaver of a Central American immigrant who was apparently infected with T.
cruzi. The parasite causes Chagas disease, which was previously confined to
Latin America. The disease can cause heart irregularities.

The CDC said it was consulting with transplant organizations nationwide to
decide whether to start screening for T. cruzi.

The second study, on bacterial infections in tissue graft patients, was launched
in November after a 23-year-old Minnesota man died from an infection he
contracted from cadaver tissue used in knee surgery.

A 17-year-old Illinois boy became sick after receiving two tissue grafts from
the same donor. That patient is recovering.

Fourteen of the 26 patients received tissue processed by the same supplier. The
CDC did not name the company.

A study raises the provocative possibility that cholesterol-lowering drugs taken
by millions of Americans can also ward off Alzheimer's disease.

The study found that high cholesterol levels appear to harm the brain and lead
to mental decline and Alzheimer's disease. But it also found that older women
who took drugs called statins -- sold under such brand names as Lipitor, Zocor
and Mevacor -- had less mental impairment than nonusers.

However, the study was not designed to test the drugs' effects on mental
sharpness, and Kristine Yaffe, a neurologist at the University of California at
San Francisco who conducted the research, said more work is needed to determine
whether statins really can lower the risk of getting the degenerative brain
disease that affects about 4 million Americans.

The study, published yesterday in the March issue of the Archives of Neurology,
also was limited to data primarily from white women suffering from heart
disease. Researchers said it is unclear whether the results would apply to
nonwhite women or men, or anyone without heart disease.

While the study appears to support a link between cholesterol and Alzheimer's,
it is not definitive, said Bill Thies, vice president of medical and scientific
affairs at the Alzheimer's Association.

Previous research on cholesterol and Alzheimer's has been mixed. High
cholesterol can narrow the arteries and raise the risk of heart disease. Some
researchers think the high cholesterol may also affect brain arteries and
promote the clumping of a protein called beta-amyloid, which is thought to
damage the brain in Alzheimer's.

Suit in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma alleges
Medtronic promoted off-label use of defective bone graft device

BYLINE: Sylvia Hsieh

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 283  words


A newly filed lawsuit alleges that a Medtronic bone graft device is defective
when used in an off-label manner and that the company knew about it but
continued to promote the off-label use.

Patricia Caplinger alleges in her lawsuit that she underwent spinal surgery in
2010 in which the Infuse Bone Graft made by Medtronic was implanted through her
back. She now suffers continuous back and leg pain, muscles paralysis causing
foot drop which led to a torn ligament in her knee, and has become at
significantly higher risk of cancer, according to the suit.

According to her complaint, filed on June 4 in U.S. District Court for the
Western District of Oklahoma, the device was approved by the Food and Drug
Administration for implants through the abdomen only and Medtronic downplayed
the risks of known complications of implanting through the back, including
ectopic bone growth, back and leg pain, and risks of sterility and cancer.

The lawsuit, filed by attorney James W. Dobbs of Rhodes, Dobbs & Steward in
Edmond, Okla., also claims that Medtronic paid influential physicians to promote
the off-label use by other physicians, and that the company omitted adverse
event reports in its sponsored studies.

"A number of patients say they have been harmed in off-label uses of Infuse,
which is approved by the FDA only for anterior-approach surgery in a small
section of the spine in the lower, or lumbar, region. At least 280 reports of
adverse events involving Infuse have been made to the FDA. Approximately 75
percent of those reports involve off-label use," the suit said.

Caplinger's suit alleges product defect, failure to warn, negligence and fraud,
and seeks compensatory and punitive damages.

BOXER KNOWS HOW CHARITY HELPS FAMILIES

BYLINE: Tom Wheatley

SECTION: SPORTS, Pg. 9

LENGTH: 283 words



Nobody had to sell Joe Potter on the Budweiser Metro Boxing Showdown.

The 10th annual charity bash, set for 7:30 p.m. Wednesday at Kiel Center, pits
area firefighters against police officers.

Potter knows all about the charity, the St. Louis Backstoppers. The volunteer
group helps families of public servants killed in the line of duty.

Potter, 25, just completed his first year with the O'Fallon (Mo.) Police
Department. Law enforcement runs in the family. His uncle, Brian Graft, was a
St. Louis city detective.

The two never met. Detective Graft was slain on duty in 1969, three years before
his nephew was born.

"My uncle and his partner were called in on a bank robbery," Potter said. "They
caught the guy downtown in an underground parking garage. They exchanged fire.
My uncle got hit one time with a .22 bullet, right in the heart.

"My uncle was supporting my grandma, my mom and three of my mom's cousins."

The Backstoppers leaped into action. "They paid off my grandma's house, which
had eight more years left on the mortgage," Potter said. "They offered to do
more, but my grandma declined. But when she eventually sold the house, that was
her retirement."

Now Potter is in the super-heavyweight co-main event on the 21-bout card, which
again features two women's matches.

Organizers hope for a crowd of 12,000, which would smash last year's record of
10,400. The Backstoppers received nearly $ 57,000, for a nine-year total of
nearly $ 355,000 from the Showdown.

"I've seen first-hand what the Backstoppers do and mean to the families," Potter
said. "And I want to help them."

Tickets are $ 15, $ 20 and $ 25. Call the 24-hour hotline at 351-8214.c

Legendary golden spruce to rise again in the Queen Charlotte Islands

BYLINE: Canadian Press

SECTION: HERITAGE; Pg. 11

LENGTH: 323  words

DATELINE: VICTORIA


VICTORIA (CP) -- The golden spruce is set to rise again in the Queen Charlotte
Islands.

The rare 300-year-old sitka spruce, a legend to Haida natives and the pride of
the village of Port Clements, was cut down by a vandal in January 1997.

It was a devastating loss for the community, but the Council of the Haida Nation
is now set to plant a graft taken from the fallen giant in the spot where it
once towered above the Yakoun River.

About 75 grafts begun in 1997 at the Cowichan Lake Research Station, a Forests
Ministry facility, are growing well on their host seedlings, manager Don Carson
said Monday. The grafts from the once-mighty golden spruce are more than
symbolic, said Guujaaw, president of the Haida council.

``They will be the tree,'' he said. ``The tree was kept alive by those shoots.
What will be interesting is if they stay golden.''

The golden spruce had been a longtime icon and a tourist draw in Port Clements,
a village of about 500 people 40 kilometres south of Masset. The 50-metre
specimen was a genetic oddity and one of the few trees of its kind to be found
from southeastern Alaska to northern California.

Haida legend says the golden spruce was formed from a young boy, according to a
story similar to the tale of Sodom and Gomorrah, Guujaaw said.

The boy was escaping from the village with his grandfather after a freak summer
snowstorm that occurred after the settlement had gone bad, he said.

``When they were leaving the village, his grandfather told him not to look back,
and when he did he turned into a tree.''

The legend goes on to say that the tree ``will be admired by the last generation
of people,'' Guujaaw said.

Thomas Hadwin, 48, who was charged with felling the spruce, said publicly he cut
the tree down, partly to increase awareness of clearcutting.

Hadwin has not been seen since the remains of his kayak were found in June 1997
after he was apparently headed to Masset for his first court appearance.

NuVasive Receives First Ever FDA 510(k) Clearance of Cervical Corpectomy Cage

LENGTH: 617  words


Oct. 12 -- NuVasive, Inc. (NASDAQ: NUVA), a leading medical device company
focused on transforming spine surgery with minimally disruptive,
procedurally-integrated solutions, announced today the first ever FDA 510(k)
clearance of a cervical corpectomy cage. The X-Core Mini Cervical Corpectomy
System is an expandable titanium vertebral body replacement device designed to
provide enhanced stability following a corpectomy procedure. This first-of-its
kind clearance further showcases NuVasive's commitment to investing in
innovative technology and clinical research to improve patient outcomes.

The NuVasive X-Core Mini Cervical Expandable VBR System (X-Core Mini VBR) is a
vertebral body replacement device indicated for use in the cervical spine (C3-C7
vertebral bodies) in skeletally mature patients to replace a diseased or damaged
vertebral body caused by tumor, fracture or osteomyelitis, in addition to the
reconstruction following a corpectomy performed to achieve decompression of the
spinal cord and neural tissues in cervical degenerative disorders. X-Core Mini
VBR is intended to be used with supplemental fixation cleared by the FDA for use
in the cervical spine. These implants are intended for use with autograft or
allogenic bone graft comprised of cancellous and/or corticocancellous bone graft
, as an adjunct to fusion. It is also intended to restore the integrity of the
spinal column even in the absence of fusion for a limited time period in
patients with advanced stage tumors involving the cervical spine in whom life
expectancy is of insufficient duration to permit achievement of fusion, with
bone graft used at the surgeon's discretion.

"The X-Core Mini system allows the surgeon a choice of endcaps and core
diameters, ensuring each construct is optimized to best address each patient's
individual surgical needs," said Dr. Neill Wright, a neurosurgeon practicing at
Barnes Jewish Hospital in St. Louis, MO. "I have used X-Core Mini in
degenerative, neoplastic, traumatic, and infectious cases. With so many options
of size and endcap, in each case, from the more common single level to the rare
five-level corpectomy, the X-Core Mini has fit perfectly and simply. The design
of X-Core Mini, from connection of the endcaps to the core, to in-situ
expansion, to locking, has proven to be straightforward, reproducible, durable
and reliable. The large central channel allows for copious amount of graft
material, and the large anterior window allows for augmentation with further
graft after insertion and expansion."

X-Core Mini must be used with supplemental fixation cleared by the FDA for use
in the cervical spine, which includes NuVasive's newly released Archon
Reconstruction Corpectomy plate. NuVasive is redefining cervical corpectomy
surgery as the Archon-R plate is designed to offer improved biomechanical
rigidity and resistance to screw pullout when compared to a traditional two-hole
plate construct and is a first-of-its kind indication by the FDA as particularly
suited for use following corpectomies for the treatment of tumors and burst
fractures.

"This assembly of best-in-class cervical products into a cohesive procedural
offering further reinforces NuVasive's commitment to providing single-source,
integrated procedural solutions to our customers," said Pat Miles, President and
Chief Operating Officer of NuVasive. "Combining X-Core Mini VBR and Archon
Reconstruction plate provides another excellent example of defining the
components necessary to properly address an unmet market need as NuVasive
remains focused on becoming number one in spine."

The ArchonReconstruction system incorporates technology developed by Gary K.
Michelson, M.D.

Burned 6-year-old faces daunting treatment with strong spirit (2 p.m.)

BYLINE: By Stella Davis Current-Argus Staff Writer

LENGTH: 396 words


CARLSBAD -- He's one tough little kid who says he needs lots of love and prayers
as he undergoes numerous surgeries and skin grafts for serious burns he
sustained to his face and upper torso on Jan. 27.

That's the message six-year-old Zachary Pope sent home this weekend with his
aunt, Becky Beard, who visited him in the burn unit at University Medical Center
in Lubbock.

The Carlsbad youngster was severely burned in a house fire and was rescued by
his mother, Jamie, before his room was totally engulfed in flames. His mother
sustained burns to her hands, forearms and foot. The boy's four-year old brother
escaped unharmed.

"His spirit s amazing," Beard said. "I told him that he is my hero. I told him
how many people in Carlsbad and around the country are praying for him. He said,
'I need love'. I wanted to hug him, but I couldn't do that. My sister (Jamie) is
doing well. We are taking it day day-by-day. He has a long road to recovery.
From the outset, the doctors told us that it would be at least two months before
Zachary is able to leave the burn unit. It's going to be a long process."

Beard said in the past two weeks Zachary has undergone skins grafts on his arms,
thighs, chest and face. He has also had bi-lateral carpal tunnel surgery on both
hands. Three pins were inserted into his fingers to ensure blood flow.

"He was burned down to his tendons on his hands. The surgery was successful. It
is just amazing that he still has eye lashes on both his of eyes. He has both of
his eyes open, but he is still on pain medication and is receiving counseling,"
Beard said.

She said Zachary was scheduled to undergo another skin graft on Monday, but the
surgery was canceled because of a bacteria found around his chest.

"The doctors are happy with the previous skin grafts, but they want to hold off
doing more until they clear up the bacteria," Beard said, adding that more donor
skin will be needed for further skin grafts.

She said the outpouring of love and support from the people of Carlsbad and from
around the country has been "phenomenal." She said cards from well-wishers have
cheered her nephew, and her family is appreciative of the monetary donations
from the community to help with expenses during Zachary's recovery process.

Updates on Zachary's progress are available, and words of encouragements to him
can be posted at www.caringbridge/visit/zacharypope

Aortic surgical procedure saving lives

HIGHLIGHT: An Abbott Northwestern specialist is one of just a few in the nation
to offer customized treatment for a special type of aortic aneurysm.


A Minneapolis vascular surgeon is one of the few doctors across the country to
treat aortic aneurysms in the area between the navel and kidneys without
surgery, providing a less invasive way to fix what can often be a silent killer.

"What this has done is open the door to people who were denied surgery in the
past, so they can have much better results," said Dr. Jesse Manunga of Abbott
Northwestern Hospital. "The idea was: 'What if we can take a graft and make it
fit the patient?' "

An aortic aneurysm is a potentially deadly blood-filled bulge in the aorta, the
main artery that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body. If it
bursts, it can kill a patient within seconds. Most patients don't know they have
one until it is too late, although an ultrasound can spot it.

Repairing an aortic aneurysm used to mean risky surgery until about 20 years
ago, when doctors began using stent grafts - tiny mesh tubes that are inserted
with a catheter and allow blood to flow past the aneurysm. However, stent grafts
have not been used on aneurysms in the area of the aorta near the kidneys,
bowel, spleen or liver because the stent could block blood flow to those organs.
For the 20 to 40 percent of patients with an aneurysm there, surgery was the
only option.

And, for patients considered too ill for surgery, Manunga said, there was really
no option at all. Doctors simply won't do the surgery and patients sometimes
died.

But using a fenestrated stent graft that he designs, Manunga is helping patients
who previously couldn't have stents or surgery. Armed with an array of detailed
scans and meticulous measurements taken from each patient, Manunga and an
Australian medical device company - Cook Medical - tailor stent grafts for each
patient's unique anatomy. The company cuts precise holes in the stent to match
Manunga's measurements.

It usually takes four to six weeks for Manunga to get the tailored stent graft
back from Cook, but in more urgent cases, Manunga can make the alterations
himself. Manunga, who learned his craft at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, is the
only one who does the procedure in the Twin Cities.

Millions of Americans are at risk for abdominal aortic aneurysms. The exact
causes are not clear, but men over age 60 who smoke and have a family history of
the problem are at the highest risk.

Over time, as the bulge grows, it can become weak and rupture. This can lead to
severe pain, massive internal bleeding or even sudden death. Most patients with
a ruptured aneurysm do not survive emergency treatment, making abdominal aortic
aneurysm the third-leading cause of sudden death in men over 60. About one in
every 250 people over age 50 will die of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm,
according to the Society of Interventional Radiology.

Aneurysms often grow slowly and go unnoticed. Some never reach the point of
bursting. An estimated 1 million people are living with an undiagnosed aortic
aneurysm; about 200,000 people are diagnosed with it each year in the United
States. Most of those cases occur below the kidneys and do not need the
specially designed stent.

Last October, Peter Eichten had no idea what was happening inside his abdomen.
After 30 years working in business administration, the adjunct professor at
Metro State University was having an annual physical. Since he had just turned
65 and was switching to Medicare, his doctor suggested the former smoker have an
ultrasound.

The news came the next day: Eichten had an aortic aneurysm and it was big enough
to need fixing.

"My doctor said, 'Well, there's this new technique. We just hired this guy,' "
Eichten said. The guy was Manunga.

Eichten went into Abbott Northwestern on Dec. 16. He had the procedure done the
next day and was home Dec. 18. He was back at work the following Monday. "It
took me about two weeks to feel really good again," he said.

A CT scan a couple weeks ago showed the aneurysm was completely gone. Eichten
set off for New Zealand last week with his wife, Jane.

"I thank my doctor every day for saying: 'Get this test,' " he said. And he's
thankful there is another option now besides surgery. Eichten is the first
patient in the Twin Cities to have this procedure. Manunga, who was recruited to
Minneapolis from the Mayo Clinic last summer, participated in about 20
procedures there.

According to Dr. Gustavo Oderich, the Mayo's director of endovascular therapy,
doctors there have treated more than 240 patients with fenestrated stent grafts
and have been key participants in clinical trials. Only a handful of doctors
nationwide have special authorization to work on patients who need grafts that
accommodate multiple openings, he said.

Besides Mayo, Oderich said other sites doing the procedure include the Cleveland
Clinic, the University of South Florida, Cornell University of New York and the
University of San Francisco. Data show that the procedure has a 97 percent
success rate and a mortality rate of 1.4 percent, less than half the 3.6 percent
mortality rate for aortic aneurysm surgery.

"Ten years from now, this will be the standard of care," Manunga said.

China targets graft, but doubts remain;
New investigations of officials announced almost daily

BYLINE: Calum MacLeod, USA TODAY

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 7A

LENGTH: 562 words


With mock prisons and scary films, Zhao Quntang tries to shock Chinese
government officials and Communist Party members to turn them away from
temptation.

Many officials take the pledge that "I won't take any bribes for the rest of my
life" after visiting the anti-graft "warning and education bases" built in
several cities by Zhao's design firm, he says.

Chinese residents, however, need more convincing. The nation is so rife with
corruption, and public opinion of those in power so low, that many people last
month cheered a thief, Fang Yunyun, who told police her gang targeted corrupt
officials to steal their luxury watches, pre-paid shopping cards and other
bribes.

To win back the public trust, President Xi Jinping has made the fight against
corruption the centerpiece of his leadership that began nearly two years ago.
His vigorous, anti-graft campaign challenging China's elite shows no signs of
slowing. New investigations of named officials are announced almost daily.

Surprising take-downs this summer include Zhou Yongkang, a former security czar
of such high rank that he was considered untouchable, and Xu Caihou, a former
military chief, who will both be prosecuted for corruption. Thousands of other
officials are being investigated.

Many more officials and employees of state-run companies are being taken on
group trips to these anti-graft "education bases" and exhibitions in cities
across the country that are usually closed to the public. That translates into a
booming business for companies like Zhao's Sanyueyu in Beijing, which also
design anti-corruption exhibits being set up in city parks and squares.

"Sometimes we design part of the hall as a prison and use digital methods such
as 4D film," he says. "Visitors see a sea of flowers and warm red sunshine, then
suddenly the scene changes, with thunderbolts and lightning strikes on the
corrupt, who fall into a big crack."

Xi's drive against corruption "is less of a campaign than a crusade, as it's
become almost religious in intensity and lengthy in terms of time," says Russell
Moses, a political analyst and dean of the Beijing Center for Chinese Studies.

Wang Teng, a  Beijing bank clerk, says he's inspired by the unprecedented scale
of Xi's effort.

"My generation has just started work, and these activities will help us follow
rules more strictly and stay clean," says Wang, 25, whose employer organized a
trip to an anti-graft exhibit   last week. "I'm fully confident that with the
determination of the leadership, and the supervision of the people, fighting
corruption will succeed."

Yet authorities are not considering public participation or oversight, warns Hu
Xingdou, an outspoken economist at the Beijing Institute of Technology.

"We can't have an independent anti-corruption agency, like in Hong Kong," he
says. "In (mainland) China, everything must be led by the party."

To scare officials, provinces organize prison visits to hear confessions of
those jailed for graft. In August, 200 workers from the powerful National
Development and Reform Commission  toured a prison now housing some  former
colleagues.

Without oversight by an independent agency, plus a news media and judiciary free
of party control, China will  fail  to prevent corruption, Hu says. "We can take
them to prison to scare them, but the effect will only last three days -- then
they forget!"

Skin graft plans wait for doctors' approval

BYLINE: Victoria Gurvich

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 7

LENGTH: 371 words


Plans for burns victim Belinda Curry to return to Melbourne from Athens for
life-saving skin grafts have yet to be confirmed.

While Omega Retrieval Services hopes to bring Ms Curry back with an
intensive-care unit next weekend, the head of the Alfred Hospital's burns unit,
Mr John Masterton, said she would remain in Athens until doctors there decided
she was fit to travel.

Ms Curry, 26, was severely burned in a car accident in Greece last week.
Yesterday, her condition was critical but stable.

While donations continued to pour into the Belinda Curry Appeal, a spokesman for
the Premier, Mr Kennett, said two people had phoned the Premier's office
offering to pay for all of Ms Curry's treatment. The spokesman would not name
the donors, but said the offers were genuine.

A relative of Ms Curry's said donations to the appeal fund passed $22,000
yesterday; $3000 of it had been wired to Ms Curry's mother, Laraine, so she
could remain by her daughter's bedside.

Mr Kennett's spokesman said the costs of Ms Curry's treatment would be met by
the appeal, the two donors and, if necessary, the Government. Earlier this week,
Mr Kennett announced that the Government would pay $30,000 for the cultured skin
needed for the skin-graft operation, but the spokesman said that contribution
might no longer be needed.

Mr Masterton said Ms Curry was receiving good care at the Athens State General
Hospital. He said the skin already being cultured for Ms Curry in Boston for the
graft operation would continue and would be ready in about two weeks, but Mrs
Joanne Paddle-Ledinek, a research scientist at Monash Medical School's skin
culture laboratory, would

also grow skin for Ms Curry should more be needed.

Mr Kennett's spokesman said Ms Curry had "substantial support" from the Greek
Government, which was ensuring that she was being well looked after and
receiving all the medical support available.

Skin taken from cadavers arrived in Athens yesterday to help prevent infection
while Ms Curry waits for permanent skin grafts.

The director of the Victorian Institue of Forensic Pathology, Professor Stephen
Cordner, who organised the donor skin for Ms Curry, said it was the best
available dressing to stop burns victims from dehydrating.

Ex-DPWH usec asks Sandigan to let him travel

BYLINE:  Cynthia D. Balana

LENGTH: 307  words


Former Public Works and Highways Secretary Manuel Bonoan, who is on trial for
graft in connection with an allegedly corrupt P15-million flood control project
in Manila, has asked the Sandiganbayan to be allowed to travel to the United
States for family reasons.

His coaccused, Japanese contractor Yoshinori Ikeda, has also sought the anti-
graft court's consent that it is not objecting to his application for a work
visa extension and the issuance of an Alien Certificate of Registration.

Bonoan and Ikeda, along with three othet DPWH officials, were indicted for
violations of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act for the partial payment
of a P15.9 million price adjustment in the Manila Flood Control Project II to
Ikeda, who was the project manager and authorized representative of the
Toyo-Ebara Joint Venture.

In his petition, Bonoan said he has to travel to Los Angeles, California, on
Sept. 18, 2013, for a period of 12 days to meet with his siblings, who are
residents there, to settle the estate of their parents who died there.

In his omnibus motion, Ikeda, through his lawyer, said he needed the visa
extension for his continued stay and work in the country while waiting for the
trial of his case to conclude.

Ikeda earlier petitioned the court to allow him to travel to Japan from Aug. 25,
2013 to Sept. 10, 2013, in order to get a thorough neurological examination from
his doctor there.

He claimed that he has experienced frequent headaches, dizziness and occasional
vomiting. He also attached a copy of the medical certificate issued by Dr. Dante
Mendoza attesting to his need to get a neurological examination.

"Accused Ikeda is not a flight risk. He has every reason to come back as his
employment is here in the Philippines. He has likewise constantly attended all
the hearings and proceedings of this case," the motion read.

Genetronics gets Phase I grant for vascular graft gene therapy

A Medical Device Daily Staff Report  Genetronics Biomedical (San Diego), a
developer of cancer and other therapies using electroporation-enabled delivery
of drugs, DNA vaccines and genes, has been awarded a grant by the National
Institutes of Health (Bethesda, Maryland) to conduct research in the field of
vascular gene therapy.

The $100,000 Phase I grant, titled "Ex vivo venous gene delivery by pulsed
electric fields," was awarded through the Small Business Innovative Research
(SBIR) program and may be followed, upon evaluation, by a Phase II award of up
to $1 million.

The SBIR grant will support Genetronics' research aimed at making vascular
transplants more effective and longer lasting. The company said vascular
diseases are the No. 1 cause of death in the U.S. and other industrialized
countries, and that vascular transplants, a frequently used method to treat such
diseases, suffer from a high failure rate, resulting in a significant unmet
treatment need.

Dr. Avtar Dhillon, Genetronics' CEO, said, "[Our] technology may help prevent
rejection or obstruction of newly implanted vessels, and increasing the number
of long-lasting vascular transplants would help patients and save healthcare
expenses."

More than 650,000 patients annually have coronary artery bypass surgery largely
requiring vein grafts. About 20% of grafts fail in the first year due to
reblockage of the grafted section, and 50% fail within the first five years.
Various genes have shown promising preclinical results in reducing such
obstruction, but their utility has been constrained by the lack of an effective
non-viral delivery method, according to Genetronics.

The company said it has shown in preclinical studies that electroporation can
facilitate intracellular delivery and dramatically improve uptake of such genes.

Genetronics is moving its lead product, the MedPulser Electroporation Therapy
System, through premarketing studies for head and neck cancer in Europe, where
it has the CE mark, and a U.S. Phase III pivotal study for recurrent head and
neck cancer.

IT&E International Group (San Diego) reported that it has signed a long-term,
multi-country agreement with Cordis (Miami Lakes, Florida), a business of
Johnson & Johnson (New Brunswick, New Jersey), for expanded FDA regulatory
compliance services. The contract calls for IT&E to validate trial results and
provide a variety of other regulatory compliance services for Cordis as it tests
new medical devices. IT&E will supply these services to Cordis' laboratories in
Miami, Puerto Rico and Mexico.

Kelly Alberts, president and chief operating officer of IT&E, said, "This is
just one of a growing number of significant contracts our business development
team has negotiated in recent months and is a good indication of the standing
IT&E has with pharmaceutical and medical devices manufacturers."

Cordis develops devices for circulatory disease management, including stents,
balloons, vena cava filters and catheters used in treating cardiovascular
disease and related conditions. IT&E focuses on providing medical device,
biotech and pharmaceutical companies with project-based consulting services and
business process outsourcing in the areas of FDA regulatory affairs, clinical
data management, clinical programming, biostatistics and clinical validation.

Anti-graft task forces adding members and publicizing their plans for reform

LENGTH: 532  words


China's local anti-graft watchdogs are beefing up their task forces to meet the
increasing demand of fighting corruption.

At least 11 of the Chinese mainland's 31 provinces, autonomous regions and
municipalities have publicized their reform plans as of Monday and nearly all 11
have increased the number of anti-graft members.

The move is in line with the requirement of the Central Commission for
Discipline Inspection, the country's top anti-graft body, which urged provincial
disciplinary authorities to complete structural reforms by the end of this year.

The latest reform plan was released on Saturday by the Hainan provincial
disciplinary and inspection commission, which announced it had established two
additional disciplinary inspection offices.

The provincial commission also created a new department to supervise anti-graft
officials. After its reforms, the number of anti-graft staff members accounted
for 64 percent of all commission members.

The commission also shuttered a department and merged four offices into one in
an effort to improve work efficiency. The total number of commission workers has
not been increased, it said.

On May 15, the Sichuan provincial disciplinary and inspection commission
increased the number of disciplinary inspection offices from four to nine. Three
senior provincial level officials in Sichuan have been investigated since the
Party's new leadership was elected in November 2012.

Many other provincial commissions have increased the number of disciplinary
inspection offices and established new departments to supervise anti-graft
officials.

The reform plans of provincial authorities are essentially mirroring the Central
Commission for Discipline Inspection's moves in March to add more than 100
officials to disciplinary posts as part of an effort to enhance supervision.

Yang Xiaodu, deputy secretary of the central commission, said on May 26 during
an online interview that disciplinary authorities should attach greater
importance to anti-graft efforts in the process of structural reform.

Provincial anti-graft bodies should finish their reforms by the end of this year
and lower-ranking disciplinary authorities in prefecture and county levels
should finish reforms by next year and by 2016, he said.

Zhou Shuzhen, a professor of public administration with Renmin University of
China, said the anti-graft campaign is likely to be enhanced along with the
reform of disciplinary bodies.

China's anti-graft authorities have enhanced their supervision of corrupt
activities in recent years, and at least 27 ministerial level officials have
been investigated since November 2012.

On Saturday, it was announced that Su Rong, vice-chairman of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee, was under
investigation for suspected grave violations of discipline and the law. Su is
the highest ranking official to be investigated since November 2012.

As of Monday, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection's website has
publicized the names of 283 officials who were investigated on charges of
corruption this year.

Washington: Researchers find reason why many vein grafts fail

LENGTH: 693  words

DATELINE: Washington


National Institute of Health, The Government of USA has issued the following
news release:

National Institutes of Health researchers have identified a biological pathway
that contributes to the high rate of vein graft failure following bypass
surgery. Using mouse models of bypass surgery, they showed that excess signaling
via the Transforming Growth Factor Beta (TGF-Beta) family causes the inner walls
of the vein become too thick, slowing down or sometimes even blocking the blood
flow that the graft was intended to restore. Inhibition of the TGF-B signaling
pathway reduced overgrowth in the grafted veins.

The team, led by Manfred Boehm, M.D., chief of the Laboratory of Cardiovascular
Regenerative Medicine at NIH's National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute,
identified similar properties in samples of clogged human vein grafts,
suggesting that select drugs might be used in reducing vein graft failure in
humans. This study will be published March 12 in Science Translational Medicine.

Bypass surgery to restore blood flow hindered by clogged arteries is a common
procedure in the United States. The great saphenous vein, which is the large
vein running up the length of the leg, often is used as the bypass conduit due
to its size and the ease of removing a small segment. After grafting, the
implanted vein remodels to become more arterial, as veins have thinner walls
than arteries and can handle less blood pressure. However, the remodeling can go
awry and the vein can become too thick, resulting in a recurrence of clogged
blood flow. About 40 percent of vein grafts experience such a failure within 18
months of the operation.

Boehm and his colleagues examined veins from mouse models of bypass surgery, and
discovered that a process known as an endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition, or
EndoMT, causes the inside of the vein to over-thicken. During EndoMT, many of
the endothelial cells that line the inner surface of the vein proliferate and
convert into more fibrous and muscle-like cells. These mesenchymal cells begin
to accumulate on the inner wall, narrowing the vessel.

This process was triggered by TGF-Beta, a secreted protein that controls the
proliferation and maturation of a host of cell types; the researchers found that
TGF-Beta becomes highly expressed just a few hours after graft surgery,
indicating the remodeling starts fairly quickly.

Boehm's team also looked at human veins taken from failed bypass operations, and
found corroborating evidence for a role for EndoMT in human graft failure. In
short term grafts (less than one year), many of the cells inside the human veins
displayed both endothelial and mesenchymal cell characteristics, while in
long-term grafts (more than six years) the cells on the inner wall were
primarily mesenchymal in nature.

"This study shows for the first time that endothelial cells in the vein directly
contribute to blood vessel narrowing following a vein graft," Boehm said. "Now
that we better understand the mechanism that causes the abnormal thickening, we
can look for therapeutic strategies to attenuate it, and reduce the number
bypass reoperations we need to perform each year."

Boehm cited the high-blood pressure drug Losartan, which can inhibit TGF-Beta,
as one possible treatment strategy, though more proof of concept studies are
needed before any clinical studies can commence.

In addition to Dr. Boehm's lab at NHLBI, other contributors to this study
included the Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee; Barts and the London NHS
Trust, London, UK; Cairo University, Egypt; University of Glasgow, Scotland, UK;
Tubingen University, Germany; CVPath Institute Inc., Gaithersburg, Md., and the
Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York City.

Report from Europe

Cardica in CE-marking, roll-out for improved arterial suturing

By DON LONG  Medical Device Daily Managing Editor  and Staff Reports
Introduction of improved product, physician training and marketing, sales - the
standard drill for device commercialization. And one other thing. Start in
Europe.

That's the trail Cardica (Redwood City, California) is climbing with recent
announcement of CE-marking for its C-Port xA Distal Anastomosis System for
venous and arterial indications.

The C-Port xA system is the next generation of Cardica's C-Port system, which
automates the attachment (anastomosis) of a bypass graft vessel and target
artery downstream of the narrowed or occluded coronary artery in coronary artery
bypass graft (CABG) procedures.

In sum, Cardica is continually positioning itself to replace hand-sewn suturing
with its automated devices, these devices requiring higher up-front costs but
providing speedier attachment and improved patency, all factoring out to
much-reduced downstream costs, Bernard Hausen, MD, PhD, president and CEO of
Cardica, told Medical Device Daily.

The company has first focused on anastomeses of vein grafts of 4-6 mm in
diameter with its devices, but improvements to the company's C-Port X system -
voila, the xA device - enables automated suturing of arterial grafts as small as
1 mm in diameter.

Hausen noted that the improvements importantly include a change from a
spring-based mechanism for deployment to a CO2 cartridge, providing a
much-increased sensation of ease for the surgeon, and he noted that a key effort
of Cardica is to develop "tools to match expectations."

Other changes include improved access to the coronary artery and reduction of
target site preparation; improved staple configuration; and incorporation of
vessel clamps for ease of loading the graft vessel for anastomosis.  The C-Port
xA is designed to deploy staples around the periphery of the anastomosis to help
ensure leak-proof sealing and enabling expansion and contraction with blood
flow.

The C-Port X system previously was CE-marked, but Hausen said the company has
not distributed it in Europe yet. Now, the xA device will be marketed through a
new Italian distributor and sold in "select" European countries in a controlled
roll-out.

The metrics of that sale present a fairly typical exercise.

The device costs about $1,000 (less with volume purchases), significantly more
than hand-suturing, but compared to 10 minutes per hand suture, Cardiac's
systems can do it in a few seconds and have been shown to produce superior
connection via comparison of patency data.

Hausen compares the technology to past and present anastomoses for the bowel,
with which he is most familiar as a surgeon.

The bowel stapler, he noted, was introduced in 1991 and "at that time, we
rejected it as initially more expensive than sutures and not using the skill
sets that surgeon typically employed. But the results were so reproducible - one
surgeon to the next, and so quick - now, despite the additional cost 95% of all
bowels are attached using stapling devices."

Hence, for the company's devices, "There's no reason that same model won't
apply," he said.

Cardica has already pushed this paradigm in the U.S. market with FDA and
international clearances of its vein grafting systems, and the company is
currently awaiting FDA clearance of the xA.

Meanwhile, Hausen said Cardica is pushing ahead with development of systems that
will be usable for the increasingly numerous, less-invasive procedures in the
cardiovascular sector with what it calls its FlexA system. That system, he
reports, is currently in the preclinical phase.

Czura Thornton acquires Chiltern International   Czura Thornton (London)
reported that it has acquired Chiltern International (Slough, UK/Carlsbad,
California), an independent clinical contract research firm, for an undisclosed
sum.

Czura Thornton, a private investment group led by Antony Czura and Nick
Thornton, acquired more than 90% of Chiltern, with the remainder expected to be
acquired "over the next few weeks."

Chiltern - with offices in Europe, India and the U.S. - runs international Phase
I-Phase IV clinical trials across a range of therapeutic categories. It provides
Clinical Operations, Project Management, Bio-analytical, Data Management,
Biostatistics, Medical Writing, Quality Assurance and Regulatory and Medical
Affairs services to the medical device, biotech and pharma sectors and clinical
contract personnel services to pharma and biotechnology clients.

Simon Garnham, co-founder of Chiltern, will step down as CEO and Nick Thornton,
who becomes executive vice chairman, also will act as chief executive. Roland
Boyd has been appointed CFO.

Established in 1982, Chiltern is one of the largest independent contract
research organizations in the world employing more than 750 people, with
locations in the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Poland, the Czech Republic,
Ukraine, India, South Africa and across the US.     S÷ren Mellstig to leave as
Gambro president/CEO     Gambro reported that S÷ren Mellstig will resign from
the positions of president and CEO but provide assistance through a transitional
period.

Jan Bruneheim has been appointed the new president and CEO, taking over those
positions on Aug. 2. Bruneheim most recently was president/CEO of the Telefos
Group.

Gambro is a provider of renal care services and products and blood component
technology.

austriamicrosystems new IC supplier to Siemens   austriamicrosystems
(Unterpremstaetten, Austria), a developer of analog integrated circuits (IC),
said it will supply Siemens Medical Solutions with detector electronics ICs for
the platform of its newest computed tomography (CT) system Somatom Definition.
austriamicrosystems said the partnership and related process development results
"in the world's most innovative computed tomography detection electronics to be
used in current and future image processing systems from Siemens."

austriamicrosystems' optical interface readout IC acquires signals in real-time
and digitizes them for improved image resolution and speed. A Siemens system may
comprise more than 1,000 austriamicrosystems ICs with the scale of integration
required by the high number of measurement channels.

Dr. Bernd Ohnesorge, vice president, Global CT Marketing and Sales at Siemens
Medical Solutions, said, "Taking advantage of austriamicrosystems' unique
expertise in designing maximum performance analog ICs, we were able to set a new
trend in CT technology with this new generation of detector electronics."

New TV series focuses on fight against graft

BYLINE: Cao Yin

SECTION: POLITICS

LENGTH: 604 words


A Chinese TV drama series based on the country's fight against corruption and on
other political developments is poised to challenge the popularity of the US hit
House of Cards.

The new series, In the Name of the People, is produced by the Supreme People's
Procuratorate's Film and Television Center. It features about 100 roles and is
being filmed with a budget of 120 million yuan ($18.46 million).

Fan Ziwen, deputy director of the center, said it is the first domestic
production to portray a State-level government official as a villain, making it
a topic of heated debate.

The series has attracted widespread attention, as the topic of corruption had
largely faded from TV screens in China after the media watchdog ordered a
reduction in the number of such shows in 2004.

Zhou Meisen, screenwriter for the new series, said such productions have not
been screened for a decade amid a nationwide increase in more-commercial shows.
But they have reappeared with the introduction of intensified efforts to fight
corruption.

Fan said, "Audiences will not see the face of the 'tiger', or State-level
official, but only hear his voice."

Actors Lu Yi and Zhang Fengyi take the lead roles in the series, which has
completed filming and is at the post-production stage. It will begin airing
later this year.

Fan said it is being shown to reflect the central leadership's determination and
the measures taken to fight corruption since the 18th National Congress of the
Communist Party of China in late 2012. It also portrays anti-graft work at home
and abroad.

In the past three years, corruption has led to the downfall of a series of
officials at provincial or ministerial level, including Zhou Yongkang, the
former security chief, who was sentenced to life in prison in June last year for
graft, abuse of power and disclosing State secrets.

Besides the "tigers", corruption among officials at lower level, or "flies",
will feature in the series.

"For example, a figure that is found to have 200 million yuan ($30 million) in
cash at home - based on reality - will appear in the shows," Fan said.

To vividly and accurately reflect judicial bodies' anti-corruption work, Zhou
Meisen said he visited prosecuting authorities and prisons to conduct
interviews. He also had discussions with prosecutors and corrupt officials
serving prison sentences.

He applauded the firm steps taken to fight graft, saying this inspired him to
join the production team for the series.

Xinhua News Agency reported in September that President Xi Jinping mentioned
House of Cards during a speech in Seattle, saying that China's fight against
corruption is based on both the government and people's desire to fight graft,
and is not a struggle for power, as depicted in the US series.

Wang Qishan, head of the Communist Party of China Central Commission for
Discipline Inspection, the country's top disciplinary watchdog, has recommended
the US series to disciplinary officers many times, Phoenix Weekly reported in
December 2013.

Chinese writer Zhang Ping said: "Many TV series are either based on arguments
among families, or are science fiction shows. We're eager to see a new series on
corruption after such a long time."

From January 2015 to March this year, applications to produce seven TV series
about anti-corruption measures were filed with the State Administration of
Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television.

Li Jingshen, director of the authority, said it is required to produce at least
two films and up to three TV series on the anti-graft fight each year.

Wang Qishan, head of the Communist Party of China Central Commission for
Discipline Inspection, the country's top disciplinary watchdog, has recommended
the US series to disciplinary officers many times, Phoenix Weekly reported in
December 2013.

Chinese writer Zhang Ping said: "Many TV series are either based on arguments
among families, or are science fiction shows. We're eager to see a new series on
corruption after such a long time."

From January 2015 to March this year, applications to produce seven TV series
about anti-corruption measures were filed with the State Administration of
Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television.

Li Jingshen, director of the authority, said it is required to produce at least
two films and up to three TV series on the anti-graft fight each year.

New TV series focuses on fight against graft

BYLINE: Cao Yin

LENGTH: 597  words


A Chinese TV drama series based on the country's fight against corruption and on
other political developments is poised to challenge the popularity of the US hit
House of Cards.

The new series, In the Name of the People, is produced by the Supreme People's
Procuratorate's Film and Television Center. It features about 100 roles and is
being filmed with a budget of 120 million yuan ($18.46 million).

Fan Ziwen, deputy director of the center, said it is the first domestic
production to portray a State-level government official as a villain, making it
a topic of heated debate.

The series has attracted widespread attention, as the topic of corruption had
largely faded from TV screens in China after the media watchdog ordered a
reduction in the number of such shows in 2004.

Zhou Meisen, screenwriter for the new series, said such productions have not
been screened for a decade amid a nationwide increase in more-commercial shows.
But they have reappeared with the introduction of intensified efforts to fight
corruption.

Fan said, "Audiences will not see the face of the 'tiger', or State-level
official, but only hear his voice."

Actors Lu Yi and Zhang Fengyi take the lead roles in the series, which has
completed filming and is at the post-production stage. It will begin airing
later this year.

Fan said it is being shown to reflect the central leadership's determination and
the measures taken to fight corruption since the 18th National Congress of the
Communist Party of China in late 2012. It also portrays anti-graft work at home
and abroad.

In the past three years, corruption has led to the downfall of a series of
officials at provincial or ministerial level, including Zhou Yongkang, the
former security chief, who was sentenced to life in prison in June last year for
graft, abuse of power and disclosing State secrets.

Besides the "tigers", corruption among officials at lower level, or "flies",
will feature in the series.

"For example, a figure that is found to have 200 million yuan ($30 million) in
cash at home - based on reality - will appear in the shows," Fan said.

To vividly and accurately reflect judicial bodies' anti-corruption work, Zhou
Meisen said he visited prosecuting authorities and prisons to conduct
interviews. He also had discussions with prosecutors and corrupt officials
serving prison sentences.

He applauded the firm steps taken to fight graft, saying this inspired him to
join the production team for the series.

Xinhua News Agency reported in September that President Xi Jinping mentioned
House of Cards during a speech in Seattle, saying that China's fight against
corruption is based on both the government and people's desire to fight graft,
and is not a struggle for power, as depicted in the US series.

Wang Qishan, head of the Communist Party of China Central Commission for
Discipline Inspection, the country's top disciplinary watchdog, has recommended

Cook readies next-generation AAA graft, delivery system

Cook readies next-generation AAA graft, delivery system

By DON LONG  Medical Device Daily Managing Editor  Cook (Bloomington, Indiana)
reported that it is readying roll-out of its next-generation Zenith FLEX AAA
Endovascular Graft for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs), together with the
recently FDA-cleared delivery system, the H&L-B One Shot Introduction System.

The company received FDA clearance of the Zenith FLEX system, which it terms
"the only hand-made device with a wide array of components and sizes" - in May,
but it has awaited FDA clearance of the delivery system before rollout.

The AAA device sector has proved difficult in creating a presence and even more
rocky in maintaining that presence.

Edwards Lifesciences (Irvine, California) earlier this year discontinued its
Lifepath AAA graft program in order, it said, to shift other priorities. And
other large companies have either exited the space or run into difficulties with
their products.

Key problems often have not been with the graft themselves but rather with the
method of delivery, Barry Thomas, director of endovascular therapies for Cook,
told MDD. He said that "high-profile devices no longer on the market" had issues
with device delivery that his company has taken pains to avoid.

"Cook has always had a very good reputation, catheter-wise, in the delivery
systems and that whole area. In Australia we developed this [next generation]
around the delivery system, so you can put it exactly where you want it and
deploy it correctly. The Cook device has two more steps than any other device,
but those steps allow us to control the device."

These steps include the use of "trigger wires" that keep the device from
expanding until it is manipulated into place more accurately "up to the last
minute," he said, and a "top cap" that holds the device's stent at the top of
deployment "exactly where you want it."

The H&L-B One Shot Introduction System also features the company's new Captor
Hemostatic Valve to inhibit blood reflux and air aspiration. Additionally, a
Flexor introducer uses a sheath construction combining optimal flexibility with
maximum resistance to sheath kinking or compression.

Besides touting the deployment features of the system, Thomas said that the new
generation of the Flex system reflects physician feedback concerning
improvements over the company's first-generation AAA system, with the advanced
system first used in Australia in 2002. For the FDA application of the
second-generation device, the company "used evidence from the Australian data,
plus a lot of deployment data and internal engineering data as well."

Rates of graft migration are "zero," he said, counting that as a "very
significant advantage." He also reported "zero blood loss, a huge improvement
over anything else available on the market."

Thomas added: "AAA affects more than 4 million people. Our endograft tackles one
of the major issues of migration, which can lead to the leakage of blood and
fluid and can ultimately create a relapse. Our clinical trials - all of which
are made available to the public - show Cook's Zenith endograft has the
industry's lowest rate of migration at 0% and endoleak at 7.5% at two years, as
well as the highest implant deployment success rate of 99.7%."

Other innovations he pointed to include widely spaced stent bodies to allow the
graft to better conform to tortuous anatomy "and sit in the aorta much more
compliantly."

Thomas said that the Zenith FLEX endograft and H&L-B One Shot delivery system
will be available for shipment in the fourth quarter, after official
introduction at the VEITHsymposium, Nov. 20-23 in New York, an intensive program
in vascular disease developed by Frank Veith, MD. Market rollout at this time
will allow the company to provide enough inventory enabling a complete
changeover, in one move, to the new generation product, he said.

In conjunction with the product rollout, Cook is hosting a small group of
screening programs for AAA around the country. And the company is working with
the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (Baltimore) to win reimbursement
for AAA screening.

"There is absolutely no reason why [AAA] shouldn't be detected, treated and the
patient live and have no future symptoms," Thomas said.

To date, more than 20,000 Zenith endografts have been placed in patients
worldwide and more than 1,300 U.S. physicians have received clinical instruction
in Cook's Zenith physician training program. Cook reports its share increasing
in the rapidly growing $280 million market for AAA graft products.

Also in this sector, W.L. Gore (Flagstaff, Arizona) has reported release of
another extension in its endo-AAA Excluder Device family, the low permeability
Gore Excluder Endoprosthesis, the fourth family extension since FDA approval of
the original Excluder Device in November 2002. The design employs a
microstructure technology that results in reduced permeability during AAA
treatment.

Gore said that the device rollout would support its U.S. market share in
endo-AAA.

Ace Baty, product specialist for the Excluder Device family, said that the
company "continues to provide the marketplace with what it needs: an endograft
with excellent long-term data, ease of use and superior service by a company
well-versed in vascular applications."

The low-permeability Excluder Endoprosthesis is composed of an ePTFE graft; a
low-permeability film layer; ePTFE reinforcing film, an electropolished nitinol
stent; and bonding film for stent to graft attachment.

The device retains the original reinforcing film, lending strength and
durability to the graft wall and a low permeability design. It also features
sutureless bonding and a low-profile, flexible, conformable deployment system.

In a statement, Gore said, "We view endovascular repair of AAA disease as a
priority for Gore now and well into the future." It said that long-term data
"indicate the device is performing extremely well. Over 17,000 patients have
been treated with the GORE Excluder Device worldwide since the first implant in
1997, with very low complications such as device migration. In addition, we've
had no issues of limb disconnections."

Product Briefs

·McKessonHBOC (San Francisco, California) introduced InterQual Durable Medical
Equipment Criteria, an automated decision support tool that helps health care
payors and providers assess the clinical appropriateness of costly and complex
equipment such as power wheelchairs and hospital beds. InterQual DME Criteria
cover pediatric, adult and senior equipment needs; the senior criteria are
aligned with Medicare coverage guidelines. The criteria development process
involved review of the literature and Medicare guidelines. Input from providers
- including physicians, nurses and physical, occupational and respiratory
therapists - also was incorporated.

·Nexell Therapeutics (Irvine, California) discussed results of a study published
in the March 22 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine that it said
offered evidence that an experimental form of stem cell transplantation,
facilitated by stem cell selection, provides a new therapeutic option for
treating a rare and potentially fatal inherited blood disorder called chronic
granulomatous disease (CGD). In the study, researchers at the National
Institutes of Health (NIH; Bethesda, Maryland), led by Mitchell Horwitz, MD, and
Harry Malech, MD, used a non-myeloablative (not destructive of bone marrow)
conditioning regimen to prepare patients to receive selected donor stem cells.
Selection was performed with an investigational version of the company's Isolex
300i Magnetic Cell Selection System to further deplete T-cells from the stem
cell grafts in an effort to prevent severe graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD), a
potentially fatal complication associated with transplantation of donor stem
cells. On the basis of these independent results, Nexell will seek FDA approval
to begin its own registration trial in support of an application to treat CGD,
and later, other inherited blood and immune disorders, with engineered stem cell
grafts.

·Response Biomedical (Vancouver, British Columbia) said that patient testing has
begun in its first multicenter clinical trial of the quantitative RAMP
point-of-care diagnostic system. The results of this study are projected to be
submitted to the FDA in June. Response is enrolling patients at four clinical
sites in the U.S. to evaluate the precision of the RAMP System and accuracy of
the quantitative myoglobin blood test in patients suspected of having had a
heart attack. RAMP tests for two additional, widely used cardiac markers, CK-MB
and troponin I, are in development and expected to enter clinical trials later
this year. The RAMP test menu will be expanded into areas such as critical care,
cancer, infectious disease and therapeutic drug monitoring. The company recently
began development of a prostate specific antigen test for Nippon Kayaku of Japan
and also will develop a test for ischemia as part of its collaboration with
Ischemia Technologies (Denver, Colorado).

Novel Ways To Counter Destruction Of Arteries

BYLINE: By HOLCOMB B. NOBLE

SECTION: Section F; Page 7; Column 5; Health & Fitness

LENGTH: 499 words


Two studies offer hope of improved treatments for some half a million heart
patients whose blood vessels have deteriorated to the point of requiring bypass
surgery.

In one study, researchers reported, healthy blood vessels were grafted onto a
section with severe deterioration and then tricked through gene therapy to
function successfully despite the adverse conditions. In the other, the body was
induced through the use of growth factors to strengthen vessels or grow new
vessels.

In both cases, the researchers said the experiments were too small to judge
their long-term value. But they said the procedures appeared to be safe and
warranted larger follow-up studies.

When bypass grafts are used to treat cardiovascular disease, problems have
arisen after a small section of the vein is transplanted onto an artery, where
it encounters higher blood pressure than it normally would along with a constant
pounding of pulsating blood. Largely as a result of this, 30 to 50 percent of
bypass grafts fail. The new hostile environment puts genetic watchdogs in the
grafted vein on the alert. They order construction of new cells to thicken and
fortify its walls. The vessel responds and begins to develop the same
arteriosclerosis, or abnormal fattening and hardening, that started the crisis.

Dr. Michael Mann, Dr. Victor J. Dzau and a team at Brigham and Women's Hospital
in Boston studied the effectiveness of using a substance called E2F decoy, or
oligodeoxynucleotide, to block the genes that start the undesired cell
proliferation. Reporting in the current issue of The Lancet, they divided 41
patients, all of whom were at high risk for graft failure, into three groups.
One group was given standard bypass treatment. The second was given veins
treated with the E2F decoy. A third group was given veins treated with a
randomly chosen sequence of genetic material.

Dr. Mann said the patients who received standard treatment showed a graft
failure rate of almost 70 percent. But those receiving E2F decoy had a failure
rate of only 29 percent.

Another Boston team, led by Dr. Michael Simons, director of the Angiogenesis
Research Center at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, used a protein called
basic fibroblast growth factor to promote growth of new vessels to replaced
blocked ones. The team reported its results in Circulation, a journal of the
American Heart Association.

During attempted bypass surgery, the growth factor, contained in time-release
capsules, was inserted into fatty tissue near blocked vessels in 24 patients.
The chemical was released over four to six weeks.

Dr. Simons said these patients, who also had severe vascular deterioration, were
all unable to accept the bypass grafts. But one group that was given the highest
dosage of the growth factor showed an improvement in blood supply and heart
function three months later. Groups given less growth factor or a placebo showed
no improvement. A larger study of 120 patients is under way.

LENGTH: 592  words


A Chinese TV drama series based on the country's fight against corruption and on
other political developments is poised to challenge the popularity of the US hit
House of Cards.

The new series, In the Name of the People, is produced by the Supreme People's
Procuratorate's Film and Television Center. It features about 100 roles and is
being filmed with a budget of 120 million yuan ($18.46 million).

Fan Ziwen, deputy director of the center, said it is the first domestic
production to portray a State-level government official as a villain, making it
a topic of heated debate.

The series has attracted widespread attention, as the topic of corruption had
largely faded from TV screens in China after the media watchdog ordered a
reduction in the number of such shows in 2004.

Zhou Meisen, screenwriter for the new series, said such productions have not
been screened for a decade amid a nationwide increase in more-commercial shows.
But they have reappeared with the introduction of intensified efforts to fight
corruption.

Fan said, "Audiences will not see the face of the 'tiger', or State-level
official, but only hear his voice."

Actors Lu Yi and Zhang Fengyi take the lead roles in the series, which has
completed filming and is at the post-production stage. It will begin airing
later this year.

Fan said it is being shown to reflect the central leadership's determination and
the measures taken to fight corruption since the 18th National Congress of the
Communist Party of China in late 2012. It also portrays anti-graft work at home
and abroad.

In the past three years, corruption has led to the downfall of a series of
officials at provincial or ministerial level, including Zhou Yongkang, the
former security chief, who was sentenced to life in prison in June last year for
graft, abuse of power and disclosing State secrets.

Besides the "tigers", corruption among officials at lower level, or "flies",
will feature in the series.

"For example, a figure that is found to have 200 million yuan ($30 million) in
cash at home -- based on reality -- will appear in the shows," Fan said.

To vividly and accurately reflect judicial bodies' anti-corruption work, Zhou
Meisen said he visited prosecuting authorities and prisons to conduct
interviews. He also had discussions with prosecutors and corrupt officials
serving prison sentences.

He applauded the firm steps taken to fight graft, saying this inspired him to
join the production team for the series.

Xinhua News Agency reported in September that President Xi Jinping mentioned
House of Cards during a speech in Seattle, saying that China's fight against
corruption is based on both the government and people's desire to fight graft,
and is not a struggle for power, as depicted in the US series.

Wang Qishan, head of the Communist Party of China Central Commission for
Discipline Inspection, the country's top disciplinary watchdog, has recommended
the US series to disciplinary officers many times, Phoenix Weekly reported in
December 2013.

Chinese writer Zhang Ping said: "Many TV series are either based on arguments
among families, or are science fiction shows. We're eager to see a new series on
corruption after such a long time."

From January 2015 to March this year, applications to produce seven TV series
about anti-corruption measures were filed with the State Administration of
Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television.

Li Jingshen, director of the authority, said it is required to produce at least
two films and up to three TV series on the anti-graft fight each year.

Joint anti-graft push needed, US delegates told

BYLINE: Zhao Shengnan

LENGTH: 481  words


China and the United States should seek consensus and deepen anti-graft
cooperation, top Party disciplinary chief Wang Qishan told a US bipartisan
delegation on Thursday in Beijing.

The call comes as China cracks down on corruption and improves its anti-graft
cooperation with the US, the top destination for Chinese officials accused of
corruption.

Wang, head of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, highlighted the
core role of the Party in China's development, and said that without discipline
it is impossible for the Party to realize the goal of leading people to build a
moderately prosperous society.

From Fox Hunt to Sky Net, China's campaigns to track down and extradite corrupt
officials have seen encouraging progress.

However, the absence of extradition treaties between China and the US has
hampered Beijing's efforts to bring more fugitives to justice.

According to the Foreign Ministry, Washington "does not seem ready" to sign such
a treaty with China as differences in social and legal systems mean that some
foreign judges have prejudices or an insufficient understanding of the Chinese
legal system.

Hong Kong-based media have reported that Wang may visit the US later this year,
and probably talk with his hosts about strengthening cooperation to track down
fugitives.

Former US trade representative Ron Kirk and former US secretary of veterans
affairs R. James Nicholson, who both led the delegation, called for greater
party-to-party communication and Sino-US cooperation.

The delegation was in China for the 8th China-US High-Level Political Party
Leaders Dialogue, which involved Democrats and Republicans discussing various
issues with the CPC.

For the first time, the dialogue included a China-US Entrepreneurs Roundtable.

Despite an end to China's decades of double-digit growth, those attending the
roundtable on Wednesday expressed optimism concerning growth and greater Sino-US
cooperation.

Bob Holden, chairman of the Midwest US-China Association and former governor of
Missouri, said the "new normal" is realistic.

"I think it's important for all of us outside of China to also work with China's
leadership to make sure that growth continues," he said.

The economy's new normal refers to the push for growth driven by domestic
consumption rather than exports and infrastructure.

Fan Bi, a senior official from the State Council Research Office, said China,
with a higher-quality economy, well-educated labor force and a sound industrial
system, remains an ideal destination for investment from developed countries.

U. tests stem-cell spray for healing

BYLINE: Ed Yeates Deseret News

LENGTH: 405 words


SALT LAKE CITY ? Surgeons and doctors at the University of Utah are testing out
a topical spray that utilizes a person's own stem cells to treat their wounds.
The treatment consists of removing red cells and combining a concentration of
platelets and progenitor cells with calcium and thrombin.

The final mixture looks like Jell-O, and the application process takes about 15
minutes.  The process was tested out on patient Kaye Adkins, who had an open
wound on her foot that weeks of treatment ? including a skin graft ? had failed
to heal. Adkins said she initially thought they were going to inject something
into her foot and was excited to hear it was, instead, a spray that would be
applied during a second graft. This time, the graft was successful, and the
wound healed. "I had never heard of anything like that," she said. "It was just
amazing." Dr. Amalia Cochran of the University of Utah Health Care Burn Center
said, in Adkins' case, as in others, bacteria must be removed before the spray
can be used.  Stem cells are already used to help patients recover from heart
surgery, but their use on burns is fairly new. While Adkins' burn is healing, so
is her heart. Stem cells were used during her bypass surgery five weeks ago to
hasten healing for that procedure as well.  Cochran said that the technology
could have a great effect on the treatment of burns of all sizes. "It's my hope
that, in my career lifetime, that stem cells will completely revolutionize how
we are able to take care of patients ? not just with small burns that are
challenging to heal ? but with massive burn injuries as well," Cochran said. The
spray, one of many developments in the world of regenerative medicine, could
have many long-term benefits for patients, according to Dr. Amit Patel, a
University of Utah cardiovascular surgeon. "We can accelerate healing or improve
healing," Patel said. "Then, it's the quality of healing. And then we hopefully
advance to decreasing the scarring process completely." According to Patel,
researchers are starting with a biological Band-Aid but hope to eventually end
up with synthetic skin that's derived from a person's own cells. "Regrowing your
own skin in a bioreactor is very realistic, and that's not five years away
even," Patel said." The military is already keeping a close eye on the Utah
project, as the technology would be helpful for treating burns on soldiers.

Graft busters seize passports of corrupt officials;
The latest crackdown is aimed at preventing corrupt officials from escaping
abroad with ill-gotten gains

                          September 18, 2003 Thursday

Xie Hong


IN A major effort to tackle corruption and prevent greedy officials from fleeing
overseas with their ill-gotten gains, China's graft busters recently seized the
passports of many senior officials in unannounced raids.

The State Council, which is China's Cabinet, also ordered checks to be tightened
at all airports and border checkpoints on travel documents held by Chinese
Communist Party (CCP) and government officials, according to a report in the
News Weekly magazine.

The move aims to block the escape route for crooked officials, who are seen as
likely to flee overseas as a last resort to avoid punishment.

Management staff of major state-owned enterprises and government-linked
companies in Hong Kong and Macau are also subject to investigation by China's
top anti-graft body, the Central Commission for Disciplinary Inspection (CCDI),
the report said.

The series of actions by China is the latest in an all-out campaign by the
authorities to fight endemic corruption.

The CCDI is dispatching several teams formed by 45 roving inspectors to
provinces such as Guizhou and Hunan to check on officials and fight against
corruption in each locality.

These teams are expected to cover all of China's 31 provinces, autonomous
regions and municipalities over a period of four years.

Official statistics show that in 2001, more than 4,000 errant officials fled
overseas, taking more than five billion yuan (S$1 billion) with them.

If unprosecuted cases are included in the calculation, some estimates put graft
-related losses suffered by the country at a staggering 200 billion yuan.

In recent years, runaway officials who live lavishly abroad with their
ill-gotten wealth have come under the media spotlight.

Ms Yang Xiuzhu, former vice-mayor of Wenzhou city in eastern Zhejiang province,
was reported to have fled to the United States in April this year after being
linked to a corruption scandal involving illegal land deals.

She reportedly bought a five-storey building complex in Manhattan.

The highest-ranking official on the run is former State Power Corporation chief
Gao Yan, previously a member of the CCP's powerful Central Committee.

The Chinese government is still trying to locate him after his disappearance in
August last year amid rumours that he was targeted in a corruption probe.

Professor Wang Guixiu of the CCP's Central Party School believes that stern and
resolute anti-graft action taken by the government is the main reason for the
exodus.

'In recent years, whenever the government adopted new anti-corruption measures,
the number of fugitives would reach a new high,' he was quoted by News Weekly as
saying.

Of more than 2,000 ministerial-level officials, about 50 have been picked up in
anti-graft campaigns over the past three years.

The fall of former party chief of northern Hebei province Cheng Weigao last
month attested to the central government's resolve in checking rampant
corruption.

However, critics and seasoned China watchers, such as Dr Zheng Yongnian of the
East Asian Institute of The National University of Singapore, dismissed the
latest anti-graft measures as having little impact.

Dr Zheng said: 'It would be ridiculous to believe that the exodus of the crooked
officials could be stopped by such administrative measures. Having more than one
passport, the officials can always find a way to sneak out of the country.'

Prof Wang said China still had a long way to go in eliminating corruption since
a sound and effective legal system had yet to be established.

How medical heroes saved a burning boy

SECTION: NEWS; General

LENGTH: 873 words


When little Tevita Tuiono strips off to reveal his shocking scars it's hard not
to look away.

The mottled patchwork of skin grafts and puckered scarring on the left side of
his torso, both legs, buttocks and one arm are so disfigured it is hard to
recognise as a child's skin.

The injuries are a cruel legacy from the day the 6-year-old accidentally set
himself on fire.

Even the parts of his body that escaped the flames are scarred, from surgeons
repeatedly taking skin grafts in a desperate attempt to save his life and heal
his wounds.

But according to burns specialist and reconstructive surgeon Richard Wong She, a
state-of-the-art skin grafting treatment developed in the United States has
given Tevita a chance of a normal life.

Wong She returned to New Zealand in 2006, after more than a year working with
burns patients in Seattle.

Tevita had already endured 18 months of operations and treatment since the
accident but, in Wong She's judgment, had little quality of life.

He was so badly scarred he could not stand up straight or straighten his left
arm.

He suffered from constant skin infection; the pocks and ripples of the patchwork
of grafts that had initially saved his life were a breeding ground for
infections that would fill with pus.

In addition, the grafted skin was starting to break down.

During his first year at school, Tevita needed to visit the school nurse almost
daily to have his dressings changed. He was permanently on antibiotics.

His mother, Rose Mahara, nursing her newborn son Sifa at their Auckland home
this week, is still horrified by the accident less than a fortnight before
Christmas 2004.

Home alone with her two young sons, Mahara left Tevita and his older brother
Jerome, now 8, playing in the lounge while she had a quick shower.

Tevita, then a toddler, pushed a small table against the stove, climbed up and
sat on one of the elements.

He reached across and fiddled with the knobs as he had seen his mother do. As
the element became red hot, Tevita's pyjamas caught fire, his nappy initially
shielding the heat.

The first thing Mahara knew was when her little boy ran to her screaming, his
clothes on fire. She put him under the shower, called an ambulance.

For Mahara and Tevita's father, Viliami Tuiono, much of what happened after that
is a blur. Mahara won't talk about it much, apart from saying it was "shocking".

At the National Burns Centre at Middlemore Hospital a team of specialists took
over Tevita's care. They knew what to expect - the small body going into shock,
shutting down.

Tevita was critically ill, kept in an induced coma on life support in intensive
care as the burns team battled with crisis after crisis. He had a 50/50 chance
of survival.

With more than 40 per cent of Tevita's body severely burned, surgeons used graft
after graft from his unburned body parts and from "donated" skin

When Tevita was discharged three months later, he was well enough to go home but
his battle was far from over. His wounds were still raw and prone to infection.

Both legs and one arm were bandaged and in splints. More skin grafts were to
come. Kidz First children's hospital, also at Middlemore, became the family's
second home.

His parents were regularly up at night trying to stop their son scratching the
unbearably itchy scar tissue until it bled. Tevita also had to constantly wear a
pressure suit to reduce the scarring.

When Wong She first saw Tevita in mid-2006, the boy was alive but, in his
opinion, "didn't have much of a life".

"I can only guess at how much misery this kid was in."

Wong She, now clinical leader for the Burns Centre, and his highly-trained burns
team began "reconstructing" Tevita's badly-disfigured body.

They used a mixture of skin grafts and a skin substitute called Integra which
Wong She had studied at the University of Washington Burns Center in Seattle's
Harborview Medical Center.

Working on average 100 hours a week and on call 24/7, Wong She says he gained a
decade's experience in just over a year. It changed the way he viewed burns
treatment and he says if Tevita's accident happened today, his treatment would
be different and the outcome substantially better.

"In the States, Integra would have been used on Tevita on day one."

Wong She and his team have spent the past three years gradually improving
Tevita's scarring, cutting away puckered and pitted tissue and replacing it with
fresh grafts.

The biggest improvement to his condition has come from using the artificial skin
which "tricks" the body into growing a new layer of dermis (the lower layer of
skin).

A new layer of epidermis (top skin) is then grafted on top of the healed dermis.

Wong She likens the epidermis to carpet, and the dermis to a good quality
underlay.

The difference for Tevita has been remarkable.

He can stand straight, use his arm, and run about like any boy his age.

Glance at him in the school playground and he is hard to pick as a burns victim.

For now Wong She plans to "leave him alone", letting Tevita play, go to school,
make friends, get his confidence back.

There is more work to be done on the scars but he will wait until Tevita wants
them improved.

"And when he hits puberty and starts growing we may need to do some more work. I
won't finally discharge him until he is an adult."

FDA Grants Regulatory Clearance to Medtronic for Aortic Transection Repair

LENGTH: 326 words

DATELINE: U.S.


U.S., Nov. 16 -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has given
regulatory clearance to Medtronic for the expanded sign of use of its tubular
stent graft for the endovascular repair of isolated lesions of the descending
segment of the thoracic aorta.

The thoracic aorta is contained in the posterior mediastinal cavity. It begins
at the lower border of the fourth thoracic vertebra where it is continuous with
the aortic arch, and ends in front of the lower border of the twelfth thoracic
vertebra, at the aortic hiatus in the diaphragm where it becomes the abdominal
aorta.

The Valiant Captivia system is fixed by using a catheter to pass the aorta to
treat transections. The system includes a particularly woven fabric sewn onto a
flexible wire-mesh frame.

Positive outcomes of a 50 patient-based RESCUE trial, became the basis of
approval of the tubular stent graft. The trial met its main endpoint with a
30-day all-cause mortality rate of 8 percent.

The study's principal investigator stated that the new signal of the Valiant
Captivia stent graft system decreases the morbidity and death rates linked with
surgical repair of transected aortas.

Further, Medtronic is scheduling to present six-month results from the RESCUE
trial later in New York, U.S.

Medtronic Inc., based in suburban Minneapolis, Minnesota, is the world's largest
medical technology company and is a Fortune 500 company. Medtronic is composed
of six main business units which develop and manufacture devices and therapies
to treat more than 30 chronic diseases, including heart failure, Parkinson's
disease, urinary incontinence, obesity, chronic pain, spinal disorders, and
diabetes. The company was founded in 1949 in a garage in northeast Minneapolis.

Graft, Nichols lead U to series split

BYLINE: From news services

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 7C

LENGTH: 161 words


Whitney Graft and Andrea Nichols collected three points apiece as the Gophers
women's hockey team defeated Bemidji State 5-3 Saturday at Ridder Arena,
salvaging a split of their weekend series.

Graft gave the Gophers an early lead with her goal off Nichols' assist at 1:11
into the first period. The Beavers responded with Tara Hiscock's goal at 6:24.
Graft put the Gophers back in front with a power-play goal at 17:41, but Bemidji
State tied it up at 18:10 with Hiscock's second goal.

Minnesota regained the lead for good with two goals in the second period.
Nichols scored her 13th goal this season on an unassisted play at 11:16, and
Marvin added her 17th goal at 14:41.

The Beavers scored their final goal at 18:12 of the third on Kelly Hart's
breakaway, but the Gophers retaliated with Jenelle Philipczyk's power-play goal
off assists from Graft and Nichols at 18:46.

The victory gave Minnesota coach Laura Halldorson at least 20 victories in each
of her 10 seasons.

Durant's season ends after graft surgery on right foot

BYLINE: Associated Press In Oklahoma City

LENGTH: 339  words


Oklahoma City Thunder star Kevin Durant had bone graft surgery on Tuesday for a
fracture in his right foot and the team expects he will return to basketball
activities in four to six months.

The league's reigning MVP had the third operation on his foot. The first
procedure was last October, and he returned to play in December with some pain.

A screw rubbing against another bone was removed in February and Durant was
expected to return in one or two weeks.

The pain persisted and Durant consulted three foot and ankle specialists. They
agreed to the bone graft surgery after it was determined pain was from the
rubbing, plus regression in the initial break.

Durant appeared in just 27 games this season, averaging 25.4 points, 6.6
rebounds and 4.1 assists.

Thunder coach Scott Brooks said Durant has been like an assistant coach
throughout the ordeal. He has been animated and involved on the sideline.

"It hasn't been easy on KD, but he has really established himself as a better
leader than ever, because when you're not playing, it's hard to stay locked in
and engaged on the team," Brooks said. "But he has done a great job of
continuing to communicate with our guys and help our guys along."

Brooks said he will stil need Durant to motivate the team from the sideline as
it chases a playoff berth.

"He knows the league as well as anybody on our team," Brooks said.

"He knows the players' tendencies as well as anybody on our team. He has to
continue to relay those messages to the guys that are out there playing because
he wants nothing but success for our guys - and that's what leaders do."

Meanwhile, injuries continue to pile up for the Thunder.

Brooks said forward Serge Ibaka (right knee surgery), guard Andre Roberson (left
ankle sprain) and forward Nick Collison (left ankle sprain) are out for
Wednesday's game against Dallas. Ibaka isn't expected back during the regular
season.

Guard Dion Waiters has soreness in his left foot. He sat out Tuesday's practice,
but he was expected to play on Wednesday.

South Cotabato representative ordered suspended

BYLINE: Kathryn Mae P. Tubadeza

SECTION: Pg. S1/10

LENGTH: 323 words


SOUTH COTABATO rep. Pedro B. Acharon, Jr. (1st district) was ordered suspended
pendente lite (pending litigation) for 60 days by the Sandiganbayan in
connection with his graft trial before the court's second division.

In a statement on Wednesday, the Office of the Ombusman said the anti- graft
court approved a resolution on January 28 which granted the preventive
suspension of Mr. Acharon.

"The authority of this Court to order the preventive suspension of an incumbent
public official has both legal and jurisprudential support," the anti-graft
court said in its resolution.

Mr. Acharon is currently on its second term and is seeking reelection for a
third term.

"[There] is no merit [too] in the argument of the accused that as Congressman of
the First District of South Cotabato, he no longer approves or implements
disbursement of public funds, as he used to do as former City Mayor of General
Santos City in which capacity he was charged in this case, or that his
constituents would be deprived of representation if he were to be suspended," it
said.

"For as long as the accused occupies a public office, he can be suspended
pendente lite as suspension follows the accused in whatever other government
position which he/she may be holding at the time of suspension," the resolution
read.

Mr. Acharon and four General Santos City local officials are facing graft
charges.

They were charged with violation of Section 3(e) of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt
Practices Act for the anomalous utilization of P2.5 million worth of funds spent
during the June 2006 Tambayayong Festival in California.

In October last year, the Ombudsman asked Sandiganbayan to suspend Mr. Acharon
pending his graft litigation for allegedly failing to liquidate the funds
million spent said festival when he was Mayor of General Santos City.

House Speaker Feliciano R. Belmonte Jr. was directed by the Sandiganbayan to
implement the suspension order.

Colorado Springs City Manager Penny Culbreth-Graft resigns

BYLINE: John Hazlehurst

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 475  words


Colorado Springs City Manager Penny Culbreth-Graft will resign effective April
16.

She told city council today that after 32 years in public service she's leaving
to launch a family business in public speaking, consulting and writing.

Vice Mayor Larry Small said the council will appoint an interim city manager to
take over after Culbreth-Graft leaves and then launch a national search for the
permanent position. He declined to name any candidates for the interim position.

Small was not surprised by Culbreth-Graft's resignation.

"I have to say that I did see this coming," he said. "It's been very difficult
for her.   She's been the target of a lot of unfair criticism. I don't think
that any city manager in our history has had to deal with the kinds of
situations that she's had to deal with, including laying off 550 employees. "

The news did not catch El Paso County Commissioner Dennis Hisey unaware either.

"I think she was pretty frustrated," he said.  "The city's in such a tough
position. "

Below is Culbreth-Graft's resignation letter:

Honorable Mayor and Members of the City Council:

This is to inform you that I am resigning my position as City Manager. My last
day will be April 16, 2010. After meeting with you earlier this week, hearing
your future direction, I believe this is a good time for me to leave the
organization so that you can pursue this new path. After 32 years of serving the
public, I will be launching a family business in public speaking, consulting,
and writing.

In my two years with the City, inheriting a substantial financial shortfall, we
have reduced deficits of $90 million and removed nearly 550 positions while
working to minimize the impacts on the public. While your staff and I have
worked diligently to plan the future with declining resources, a plethora of
options remain available should you wish to reconsider them. I have worked to
leave you with a plan for continued cuts and shedding of municipal operations.

I want to commend each of you for your relentless service to this community.
What you are doing is thankless, time consuming, and difficult.

Finally, my comments must focus on the public servants who have labored
tirelessly to care for the people of our city. They are to be commended for
their professionalism-especially in these times of severe scrutiny. They are
remarkable. I urge you to consider the business case for avoiding further cuts
in compensation-especially given the looming collapse of the TABOR cap that will
ensure no adjustments despite a future economic recovery. Even without any
decreases, your workforce is behind the market and will lose ground as each city
on the Front Range recovers, making it impossible to employ a competent,
trained, and knowledgeable workforce.

Thank you for the privilege of serving the City of Colorado Springs.

Sincerely,

Dr. Penelope Culbreth-Graft

Ron Zwanziger, CEO of IMI, said, "The drugs-of-abuse testing market has
exhibited rapid rates of growth, and we believe this area continues to have
strong potential. In addition, the availability of a confirmation testing
service will further help in the growth of the FirstCheck home drug testing
business which we acquired earlier this year."

Robert Mount, CEO of Redwood said that it is company has been a partner of
Inverness "for quite some time. Our solid relationship and shared vision for the
future make this a positive step for both companies."

Grants roundup: Wright Medical gets $2.4M for bone graft clinical study

LENGTH: 412 words

A Medical Device Daily Staff Report

Wright Medical (Arlington, Tennessee) reported it has received a $2.4 million
grant from the U.S. Department of Defense to fund a clinical study of bone graft
substitute pellets in combat-related open fracture wounds.

The study will focus on Wright's Osteoset T surgical grade calcium sulfate bone
graft substitute. Osteoset T hasn't been approved for use in the U.S. by the
FDA, but the study would allow the U.S. military to enroll service members who
have suffered combat related injuries in the study. If successful, the company
could submit a pre-market application for Osteoset T in the U.S.

"Blast injuries suffered during combat can result in severe, open fracture
wounds needing acute care. Infection of bone and surrounding tissue poses great
threats to the limb salvage and overall health of our wounded soldiers," said
Scott Shawen, director of orthopedic foot and ankle surgery at Walter Reed Army
Medical Center (Washington). "Given the propensity for infection and potential
subsequent amputation in many traumatic military injuries, current practices
need to be improved upon with novel treatments and techniques," he added.

Jason Drenning, senior manager of strategic scientific communications at Wright
Medical, said the company had successfully treated military injuries with its
previous Osteoset product, but the traumatic nature of combat injuries requires
a treatment to not only reduce the infection rate, but also serve as a "bone
void filler."

"We are optimistic that Osteoset T pellets may result in even lower re-operation
and infection rates and equivalent success in inducing fracture union," Drenning
said in a statement.

In other grants news; Accuray (Sunnyvale, California) reported that the company
was awarded a $1 million Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant by the
U.S. Government to be used toward further development of a high-energy X-ray
source for Homeland Security applications.

The grant will fund the development of a next generation, compact X-ray source
with unprecedented capabilities bundled with a high-energy linear accelerator.

Phase one of the project, which was also funded by an earlier SBIR grant, was
completed in June 2010 and included the analysis and design of the major
subsystems for the prototype. Phase two will consist of the development of the
prototype that is intended to be used as a critical part of cargo scanning
systems by the Department of Homeland Security.

An anti-graft law will help nation put power in a cage

LENGTH: 411  words


AT THE SECOND PLENARY SESSION OF THE ONGOING SESSION of National People's
Congress, held on Sunday, the Standing Committee delivered their work report,
which promoted accelerating the legislation on key issues. Among its plans, that
of an anti-graft law, which has long been called for, has attracted special
attention. Comments:

After two years of high pressure, corruption has been, temporarily at least,
curbed, with large groups of senior corrupt officials or "tigers" and lower
level corrupt "flies" being removed from key positions. Now it is time to start
the building an anti-graft system so as to prevent rampant corruption from
appearing again.

Beijing Youth Daily, March 9

The idea of an anti-graft law has been widely welcomed by the public, because
currently there are only limited numbers of Party discipline, which are
fragmented into various regulations and contradict each other. Over the decades,
corrupt officials have used these loopholes to lighten the punishments for their
colleagues who get prosecuted. A single anti-graft law will plug the loopholes
and make sure corrupt officials get their deserved punishments.

Southern Metropolis Daily, March 10

In 2013, Shantou and Zhuhai cities, two special economic zones in Guangdong
province, South China, passed anti-graft regulations that contained detailed
columns on the disclosure of the property owned by officials and prohibited
luxurious spending at the public expense. Many developed countries have their
laws, too; both domestic and international examples can be resorted to in
drafting China's national anti-graft law.

people.com.cn, March 11

An anti-corruption law should not only define what deeds constitute corruption
and what penalties officials deserve for committing them, but also properly
regulate power and prevent officials from abusing their powers from the bottom
up.

Wang Changjiang, a researcher at the Party School of the CPC Central Committee,
March 11

It was in 1999 that an NPC member first proposed an anti-graft law; over the
following years, there have been public calls for the officials to disclose
their property ownership and a prohibition on officials' family members from
running businesses related to the power they have access to, but all failed to
materialize. Currently, with rampant corruption being temporarily curbed, a
precious opportunity of drafting anti-graft law has emerged. Please do not let
it go.

SECTION: BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS

LENGTH: 368 words


Oct. 26--URBANA -- Five teams from the University of Illinois will advance to
the regional round of the Idea to Product Competition after winning the UI's
campus round last week.

Heading to the regional round at St. Louis University on Feb. 17-18, 2012, will
be:

-- BioDynamics: Active Knee Brace, a team that seeks to design and build a
prototype for a knee brace that will help users move from a seated position to
standing position.

-- BioLife, a team that seeks to build bioreactors by using patients' own cells
to produce multiple grafts and thus allow for testing of grafts to make sure
they're ready for implantation. That could eliminate problems commonly
associated with autologous and synthetic grafts.

-- Effimax Solar, which has developed nanotexturing techniques that can make
solar cells more efficient and slash the cost of solar power. The team believes
it can reduce the cost per watt of a crystalline silicon solar cell by 19
percent. Effimax Solar won the 2011 Cozad New Venture Competition.

-- Local Materials.com, which proposes building a search-engine site for
construction materials. Users could search for materials online and discover
their distance from the construction site.

U.S. District Court for the District of Vermont: Obese burn victim wins $1.16 M
award

BYLINE: Nora Lockwood Tooher

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 1273  words


At 460 pounds, Charles E. Olanyk was so obese that the first lawyer he went to
see refused to represent him in his medical malpractice suit against a prominent
Brattleboro, Vt. physician.

Many jurors have an unspoken bias against obese plaintiffs, and the odds of
finding a jury sympathetic to Olanyk were slim, the lawyer reasoned.

Thomas Lesser also had concerns about Olanyk's weight, but the Northampton,
Mass., attorney agreed to represent him. Olanyk claimed the amputation of his
right leg was caused by the failure of Dr. John R. Bookwalter to refer him to a
burn specialist after he burned the bottom of his foot.

Lesser decided to confront the weight issue head on. And he ended up winning his
client a $1.161 million award.

During voir dire, Lesser asked jurors to assure him they wouldn't treat Olanyk
differently because of his weight.

Once the trial began, Lesser emphasized Olanyk's positive attributes. A
50-year-old manager at a soda bottling plant in Brattleboro, Olanyk was
hard-working, devoted to his family and an elected official in his community.

Lesser explained that Olanyk's weight gain was not simply caused by overeating,
but was mainly due to the effects of a steroid he had taken to increase his
fertility so that he and his wife could have children.

"The fact that he took medication to have a child was very powerful," Lesser
said. "And the fact that he was so competent was very helpful. He's got a job
where he's making $50,000 a year, he's supervising employees and he's a
selectman.

"I think juries think of obese people very often as being non-functional people,
and he was obese, but functional," Lesser said.

Defense attorney Peter B. Joslin agreed that Olanyk was an effective witness.

"He related well, I thought, to the jury," he said.

Olanyk testified that he had been fearful of weight-loss surgery, although he
did have it after his amputation, and weighed about 320 pounds at the time of
the trial.

Standard of care

Having dealt with Olanyk's weight, Lesser focused throughout the five-day trial
on the standard of care for treating serious burns.

The plaintiff's expert argued that Dr. Bookwalter should have referred Olanyk to
a burn specialist so that he could have received aggressive treatment of the
burn, including skin grafting.

The defense countered that Bookwalter's treatment plan met accepted standards of
care. And a vascular surgery expert testified that Olanyk's lymphedema and
morbid obesity, as well as an inability to heal ulcers and lesions in the past,
meant that a skin graft was not likely to succeed.

"My client's position was that due to Mr. Olanyk's morbid obesity - and his
co-morbidities - that the better choice for treating this ... foot burn was to
do it conservatively on an outpatient basis," Joslin explained.

However, Lesser showed jurors portions of three medical textbooks which all
stated that the standard of care for treating second- and third-degree burns on
the bottom of the foot is to refer the patient to a burn center.

"This was really about the standard of care," Lesser said. "He could have said
to the patient, 'I want you to know that the standard of care is to send you to
a burn center. You make the choice. ' He didn't involve the patient. The doctor
made the decisions for the patient.

"When a doctor makes a decision for a patient and it turns out to be the wrong
decision, then he's responsible," Lesser said.

Jurors agreed, awarding $1.161 million in damages, which was later reduced in a
post-trial settlement to $1 million.

Third-degree burn

Olanyk had burned the bottom of his right foot while using a heating pad to
treat a stubbed toe. He couldn't feel the burning occur because his undiagnosed
diabetes and neuropathy numbed the nerves on the bottom of his foot.

But the nerves in his toe were not affected, so when he felt pain in his big
toe, he assumed it was broken. Because he was so grossly overweight, he couldn't
look at the bottom of his foot to see what was wrong.

Olanyk initially went to an orthopedist, who determined that the toe wasn't
broken. The orthopedist diagnosed a deep second- or third-degree burn and
referred him to Bookwalter, who had treated Olanyk for 14 years for high blood
pressure, obesity, lymphedema and ulcers on his legs.

Bookwalter prescribed twice-daily dressing changes, an antibiotic cream and oral
antibiotics. He saw Olanyk five additional times, maintaining the same course of
treatment, and describing it as a third-degree burn.

Bookwalter had determined that because of Olanyk's weight and because he had
ulcers on his legs which had not healed well, the most prudent thing to do was
to wait for the wound to close as much as it was going to close, and then do
some skin graft later.

"Our position was that he should have done a skin graft right away and sealed
it," Lesser said.

"[Bookwalter] says that you couldn't graft because of lymphedema. You couldn't
graft because of obesity. Well, those are all common conditions," Lesser told
jurors. "And we all know people like that have grafts. "

A month after his initial visit to Bookwalter, Olanyk went into septic shock and
underwent an emergency amputation of his leg below the knee.

Olanyk's wife and daughter testified that since the amputation he has been
depressed, has memory loss and has been unable to work.

'Behind the times'

Three medical textbooks helped seal the verdict, according to Lesser. All three
stated that serious burns on the foot should be referred to a burn center, and
that the standard of care for treating a third-degree burn on the foot was
excising the dead skin and grafting new skin onto the foot.

Lesser had the books sitting in view of jurors throughout the trial.

"We had the pages projected onto the screen," Lesser recalled. "While the expert
was reading the portions into the record, the jury had them available to look at
and had the ability to take notes. "

The defense argued that because of Olanyk's complicated medical condition, other
options for treating the burn were reasonable.

"Medicine is not a cookbook, and the textbook doesn't say if you are morbidly
obese and you have chronic lymphedema you might want to consider an
alternative," Joslin noted.

But in his closing argument, Lesser told jurors: "All three textbooks clearly
state that leaving ... dead tissue on a burn and waiting for it to separate,
which was the treatment that Dr. Bookwalter chose, was no longer appropriate
treatment ... The fact of the matter is Dr. Bookwalter was behind the times. "

Lesser also questioned the credibility of the defense expert, who had been an
intern and medical resident with Bookwalter in Boston.

"He's hardly an unbiased witness," Lesser said in his closing.

Joslin took issue with Lesser's characterization of his expert, whom he
described as a "very good witness who had extensive experience. "

"I would disagree with Tom in that regard," he commented.

Although he did not ask for a specific amount of damages, Lesser noted that his
client's medical expenses totaled $360,000. He estimated lost wages at $500,000
to $900,000.

Jurors deliberated from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., and then told the judge they could
not agree on a verdict. The judge reminded them that a unanimous verdict is
required in Vermont and encouraged them to continue deliberations.

Two hours later, the jury ruled unanimously in favor of Olanyk.

Medtronic's Endurant AAA Stent Graft Delivers Durable, Consistent, Proven
Outcomes at Four Years in Real-World Setting

LENGTH: 585  words


Nov. 17 -- Selected for nearly one of every two endovascular abdominal aortic
aneurysm (AAA) repairs globally, the Endurant AAA stent graft system from
Medtronic plc (NYSE: MDT) continues to maintain durable and consistent outcomes
at four years in real world settings, including challenging anatomies. Hence
J.M. Verhagen, M.D., Ph.D., Professor and Chief of Vascular Surgery, Erasmus
University Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, presented on the market
- leading stent graft on the opening day of the VEITHsymposium in New York City.

Patients with challenging anatomy have historically been associated with limited
eligibility for endovascular repair and higher rates of adverse events. Dr.
Verhagen's presentation focused on results across a range of patient anatomies.

"Analysis of the patient cohort from the four-year global ENGAGE registry
included several anatomically challenging sub-groups:  short, highly angulated,
and calcium/thrombus burdened AAA necks.  These mid-term outcomes offer clinical
insight into the treatment of AAA neck anatomies relevant and applicable to
current clinical practice and real world settings," said Prof. Verhagen.

At four-years, no significant differences were found between the short neck
(>=10-&lt;15mm) and standard neck (>=15mm) cohorts in terms of type Ia endoleak
rate and AAA diameter increase. Low rates of aneurysm rupture and conversion to
open surgery were demonstrated through four-year follow-up, and there was no
significant difference between the cohorts in terms of secondary endovascular
procedures.  Freedom from aneurysm-related mortality (ARM) at four-years was
99.2 percent for the short neck cohort and 98.3 percent for the standard length
necks.

The Endurant stent graft system is approved outside of the U.S. for use in
patients with AAA neck lengths >=10 mm and &lt;=60 infra-renal angulation and
>=15mm with &lt;=75 infra-renal angulation. In the U.S., the Endurant stent
graft system is indicated for necks >=10 mm and &lt;=60 infra-renal angulation.

The Endurant system received the CE (Conformite Europeenne) mark in June 2008,
and since that time the global ENGAGE registry has enrolled more than 1,200
patients at 79 sites across six continents. U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) approval was received in December 2010. With ten-year follow-up planned
for all patients, the ENGAGE registry represents the most robust post-market
registry ever initiated.

Marc R.H.M. van Sambeek, M.D., Ph.D., Department of Vascular Surgery, Catharina
Hospital, Eindhoven, the Netherlands, will report on the four-year full cohort
analysis from the global ENGAGE registry on Saturday, November 21.

"The global ENGAGE registry demonstrates Medtronic's unmatched commitment to
clinical research on endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR)," said Daveen Chopra,
vice president and general manager of the Aortic business, which is part of the
Aortic & Peripheral Vascular division at Medtronic. "Through dedication to
clinical data and innovation in technology, we hope to expand EVAR treatments to
previously untreatable patient populations."

In collaboration with leading clinicians, researchers and scientists worldwide,
Medtronic offers the broadest range of innovative medical technology for the
interventional and surgical treatment of cardiovascular disease and cardiac
arrhythmias. The company strives to offer products and services that deliver
clinical and economic value to healthcare consumers and providers around the
world.

Sandiganbayan suspends solon over P2.5-M unliquidated funds

BYLINE: Marc Jayson Cayabyab

LENGTH: 337  words


The Sandiganbayan has suspended South Cotabato Representative Pedro Acharon Jr.
who faces graft charges for failing to liquidate some P2.5 million used for a
dinner festival in Los Angeles, California.

According to an Ombudsman press release on Wednesday, the anti-graft court's
Second Division granted its request to impose a 60-day preventive suspension on
Acharon.

The authority of this Court to order the preventive suspension of an incumbent
public official has both legal and jurisprudential support, the court said in
its resolution promulgated Jan. 28, 2016.

Acharon was suspended pending his graft litigation for allegedly failing to
liquidate P2.5 million spent for the Tambayoyong Festival in Los Angeles,
California, from June 9 to 16, 2006, when he was General Santos City mayor.

The budget was intended for the dinner of 37 participants, but only 17 showed
up. Acharon allegedly failed to liquidate the P2.5 million and caused undue
injury to government.

In suspending Acharon, the court said it found no merit in his claim that he no
longer approves or implements disbursement of public funds, as he used to do as
former City Mayor of General Santos City in which capacity he was charged in
this case.

Acharon is the incumbent South Cotabato First District representative.

The court said Acharon could be suspended even for an offense committed in a
position he previously held.

For as long as the accused occupies a public office, he can be suspended
pendente lite as suspension follows the accused in whatever other government
position which he/she may be holding at the time of suspension, the court said.

The court also found no merit in his defense that his constituents would be
deprived of representation if he were to be suspended.

The court directed Speaker Feliciano Belmonte Jr. to implement the suspension
order.

In asking the court to suspend Acharon, the prosecution said the lawmaker
pleaded not guilty to the charges on March 18, 2014, and thus the suspension
against him should be mandatory under the law.

Aston Villa's treatment of Jack Grealish has been harsh - making him train with
kids achieves nothing;
Whether or not Grealish has it in his character to put in that hard graft and
show that ­dedication and determination remains to be seen, but his punishment
is misguided

BYLINE: By Andy Dunn

SECTION: SPORT,SOCCER,SOCCER NEWS

LENGTH: 602 words


Seven days ago, referring to the stick Jack Grealish was getting from Irish fans
after the Republic's ­qualification for Euro 2016 and his struggles with form, I
wrote this:

"... maybe this is what Grealish needs - a kick up the backside to remind him
nothing other than hard graft, ­dedication and a determination to improve will
give him the opportunity to play on the game's grandest stages."

The kick up the backside was swift in arriving and the sentiments stand.

Whether or not Grealish has it in his character to put in that hard graft and
show that ­dedication and determination remains to be seen.

But the fullness of time will show that ... not a couple of social jaunts in his
time off.

For all those who get wound up by talent not being matched by application,
Jack's ­shenanigans - if you can call them that - last weekend were grist to the
mill.

And there have indeed been signs that Grealish may not be concentrating on
­football around the clock.

Lying sparko and inebriated on a ­Tenerife pavement was one, a penchant for
hippy crack another.

But the over-­reaction to his 24 hours of socialising has been startling.

And a reminder that ­professional football has become a haven for the po-faced
and puritanical.

Surely you can be hard-working, dedicated and ­determined - and still have an
evening or two out with pals? It seems not.

And when Paul Merson is telling you to get on the straight and narrow, you know
times have changed. For the duller.

Merse toasted Tony Adams' winner in the 1993 FA Cup semi-final against Spurs
with a memorable drinking ­celebration.

Those were the days when footballers were allowed to have fun, a pint and a
night out.

We don't know exactly what Grealish got up to in a Manchester nightclub last
Saturday, but pulling a silly face for a mobile phone - not long after Villa had
been cuffed at Goodison Park - was probably his most heinous crime.

Apparently, he carried on "partying" the following day, although reports of him
beating anybody up, getting involved in sozzled orgies or anything like that
appear to have passed me by. I did read that he was filmed "singing into the
camera in an enthusiastic manner" on Saturday night and, the following day -
shock, horror - "hosted a gathering involving two blonde women" in the public
bar of a very nice Birmingham hotel.

Wow. We've found an heir-apparent to the dear, departed Oliver Reed.

As wild weekends go, I'm guessing it's not going to be the template for another
­instalment of The Hangover.

Still, it was enough for Remi Garde to make Grealish train with the under-21s
for a couple of days.

Exactly what is that supposed to achieve?

Will practising with the kids make Grealish a more ­accomplished player? No.

And if you want him to show more maturity, then punish him in a mature way, not
give him the equivalent of lines.

Garde has only known Grealish for a few weeks and is already denouncing him as
unprofessional.

Their relationship has not got off to the best of starts.

Perhaps Garde is not impressed a picture of Grealish hugging Tim Sherwood still
adorns the player's Twitter feed.

Gutted, reads Grealish's accompanying comment. Not as gutted as he is now, I'd
guess.

Considering Villa's ­predicament, perhaps Grealish was unwise to let his hair
down. Perhaps he does need to change his ways.

Perhaps he did need that kick up the backside.

But regardless of previous, he has been harshly dealt with and portrayed on this
occasion.

And already Garde and Grealish looks like a combination that will last little
longer than a decent night out.

And, for Villa, that would be sad.

Has Grealish been harshly treated by Aston Villa?

HEALTH TALK: Maintaining a painfree back

BYLINE: Dr. Clifford Solomon

SECTION: HEALTH; Pg. B7

LENGTH: 429  words


Eighty-five percent of all Americans experience low back pain, but the good news
is more times than not, it will get better on its own without surgery.

To remember to avoid back pain all together you should strengthen your core
muscles. Maintaining a healthy weight and keeping your abdominal area strong
will keep pressure off the joints and discs in your back and they will not get
irritated and shift. Also, do not smoke which increases disc space degeneration.

Avoid forward flexing motions, like bending over, sit-ups and heavy lifting. If
you have to do an activity where you consistently bend forward, do it with your
knees, not your back.

Sometimes, back pain is unavoidable. After trying to relieve it at home by
resting for 24 to 48 hours and taking Motrin, sometimes seeing a specialist can
help relieve the pain more quickly with physical therapy to strengthen core
muscles and support the lower back or prescription medications.

If the discs become regularly irritated, they could collapse. And if the joints
are arthritic, having severe back pain will become a vicious cycle and your
physician will more than likely consider referring you to a surgeon or a pain
management specialist.

About 15 percent of patients with low back pain will require further
intervention. Lumbar spine surgery is typically the last resort, if you are not
getting the relief you need after seeing a nonsurgical pain management
specialist. Less invasive techniques tend to work much better because less
stress is placed on other parts of the back that aren't experiencing discomfort
or pain.

A laminotomy is when pressure is taken off of the nerve root that is causing
pain through a small incision. A laminectomy/discectomy is when the ruptured
part of the disc or the abnormal disc material is removed.

Depending on the complexity of the pain and the problems it is causing, another
option is a spinal fusion which is when the ruptured disc or bone spur is
removed and the nerve is released. The surgeon will build a bony bridge between
the vertebrae using pieces of bone, or bone graft, obtained from a patient's
pelvis, a donor or other bone substitute.

The bone graft is either laid next to the vertebrae or actually placed between
the vertebral bodies - in this case, the rubbery disc must be removed. Bone
grafts have to heal and unite to the adjacent bones before the fusion is solid.
Plates or rods are often used to protect the graft and stabilize the spine as it
heals.

Parker Waichman LLP, Co-Counsel, File Various Actions in Medtronic InFuse Bone
Graft Product Litigation

LENGTH: 591  words


(PRWeb) - Parker Waichman LLP, a national law firm dedicated to protecting the
rights of victims injured by defective drugs and medical devices, announces
three filings, two judicial assignments, and three status conferences, all filed
on June 16, 1015 in the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis, State of
Missouri, 22nd Judicial Circuit. Filings involve lawsuits brought over
Medtronic's InFuse Bone Graft and LT Cage product and were filed on behalf of
numerous plaintiffs who were surgically implanted with the InFuse Bone Graft and
LT Cage medical product. The filings were made by Jerrold Parker of Parker
Waichman LLP; Richard J. Arsenault of Neblett Beard & Arsenault; Nicholas
Drakulich of The Drakulich Firm; Eric Holland of The Holland Law Firm; and Mark
Lanier of The Lanier Law Firm. In an effort to keep the cases moving forward,
the Missouri Circuit Court, Twenty-Second Judicial Court, City of St. Louis, has
set Status Conferences for September 2, 2015 in Smith vs. Medtronic (Case No.
1322-CC9531-02), Hendrich vs. Medtronic (Case No. 1422-cc-1224-01), and Anders
vs. Medtronic (Case No. 1322-CC10219-02).


In addition, the Missouri Circuit Court, Twenty-Second Judicial Court, City of
St. Louis, has issued Orders for Judicial Economy on the Court's own motions and
specifically assigned Smith vs. Medtronic (Case No. 1322-CC9531-02) and Hendrich
vs. Medtronic (Case No. 1422-cc-1224-01) for trial to Division 5, Judge Mark
Neill.
"As a firm that represent many individuals who have filed lawsuits over alleged
injuries associated with Medtronic's InFuse, we are very pleased to see the
litigation continue to move forward," said Gary Falkowitz, Managing Attorney at
Parker Waichman. "We continue to provide free consultations for anyone who seeks
more information about their rights."
Court documents for the actions involved all similarly allege product liability
and fraud against device maker, Medtronic Inc., and its wholly owned
subsidiaries, Medtronic Sofamor Danek, USA, Inc., and Medtronic Sofamor Danek,
Inc. over its InFuse Bone Graft LT-Cage Lumbar Tapered Fusion Device System.
InFuse received very narrow and limited U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
approval for use in a single level fusion. In 2002, InFuse was approved for
singular placement between two vertebrae in the lumbar region; use was
assiduously expanded in 2004 to include the L4-S1 region and was later approved
for use in a specific surgical approach: the Anterior Lumber Interbody Fusion
(ALIF). InFuse is a system that combines two components and consists of three
parts.  According to court documents, most plaintiffs underwent spinal fusion
surgery with fusion cages; all plaintiffs underwent a spinal fusion procedure
and procedures were generally performed due to back pain. Reported injuries
associated with the off-label use of InFuse include adverse reactions in the
cervical spine, including, but not limited to, swelling, dysphagia (difficulty
swallowing), and dysphonia (voice disorders), according to court documents.
Parker Waichman is currently offering free legal consultations to victims of
Medtronic InFuse Bone Graft Injuries. If you, or someone you know, suffered a

Anti-graft campaign needs to move forward, experts say

Analysts emphasize need for legal framework to fight corruption

Chinese anti-corruption work should step into a new stage with upgraded laws
that prevent as well as fight graft, judicial experts said, after a landmark
meeting of the country's top Party officials concluded on Thursday.

The number of local and national officials who were investigated or punished for
graft over the past two years shows the seriousness of corruption, but it also
reflects the significant effects of the country's anti-graft campaign, said
Cheng Lei, associate law professor of the Judicial Reform Research Center at
Renmin University of China.

The efforts against graft will be intensified after the Fourth Plenary Session
of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, which was held in
Beijing from Monday to Thursday, and more corrupt officials will be exposed,
Cheng said.

Since the Chinese leadership launched the anti-graft campaign, more than 40
officials at the ministerial level or above have been sent to prison or
investigated for corruption.

Several national-level officials attracted the most public attention.

One month after Xu Caihou, a top military general, was expelled from the Party
for violating discipline on June 30, Zhou Yongkang, former member of the
Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China, was
probed for "serious disciplinary violations".

Also in June, Su Rong, a former vice-chairman of China's top political advisory
body, was investigated and removed from office.

Before the probe of the three national-level officials, Bo Xilai, 65, former
Party secretary of Chongqing, was sentenced to life in prison for accepting
bribes, embezzlement and abuse of power in September 2013 in Jinan, Shandong
province.

"As these officials are investigated and legally dealt with, it's also the time,
and a necessity, to upgrade the crackdowns and prevention of graft under laws,"
Cheng said.

Although officials are asked to report their property to the public, "there are
still some people who refuse and disobey because the requirement is not a law
that everyone must abide by and can be punished for violating", he said.

Cheng highlighted the urgency of developing a legal framework and effective
procedures for better enforcing the rule of law.

Yang Xiaojun, a law professor at the Chinese Academy of Governance, said the
work against graft cannot only rely on a group or department. "Instead, what we
demand is a system or mechanism" that is established under laws.

The deterrent effect of the country's anti-graft work has been established after
a large number of officials were investigated and punished, "but how to keep
more officials from corruption is more important," Yang said.

"As power is put in a cage, officials' improper behavior will be restricted.
Only when the anti-graft work is put into laws will the campaign against
corruption never cater to leadership," he said.

It was also the first time the plenary session took the rule of law as a
priority and topic in such a key meeting, "which shows the Party's determination
to push forward our country's judicial work," he added.

Agency With a History Of Graft and Corruption

BYLINE: By ALAN FEUER

SECTION: Section B; Column 0; Metropolitan Desk; Pg. 4

LENGTH: 834 words


If you went looking for examples of corruption, graft and bungling in the New
York City Department of Buildings, you certainly wouldn't have to go far. The
headlines alone are like a monotone refrain.

''Consultants Investigated Over Bribes for Buildings.'' ''Buildings Official
Charged With Accepting Gifts.'' ''Plumbing Inspectors Are Latest Charged in New
York Graft.''

For more than 200 years, the department has been plagued by allegations ranging
from the dastardly to the absurd. Plumbing inspectors have been charged with
taking bribes. Consultants have set up get-aways for influential councilmen. A
deputy commissioner was once indicted for accepting an illegal gift of wine.

As the agency responsible for overseeing the roughly $12 billion in annual
private construction in the city, the Buildings Department is clearly echt New
York -- at least as echt as the Police Department or the Fire Department, which,
of course, have both had troubles of their own. What seems to distinguish
Buildings from the others, though, is not the severity or frequency of the
problems, experts say, but its ostensible invulnerability to reform.

''It's perennial,'' said D. Kenneth Patton, a professor at the Real Estate
Institute at New York University. ''This has been going on forever.''

The latest debacle at the agency occurred on Tuesday when its commissioner,
Patricia J. Lancaster, resigned in part because of pressure resulting from a
fatal crane accident at an 18-story East Side building last month. Not only was
the building inspector in charge of the crane accused of faking his report; Ms.
Lancaster soon reported that the building's design violated four local zoning
regulations and that it never should have received its initial permits.

As far back as 1871, The New York Times published a story headlined
''Disgraceful Corruption in the Department of Buildings.'' The story described a
meeting of 25 architects, ''uptown builders'' and house owners who released an
11-point petition charging the department with ''tyranny'' for habitually taking
bribes. One check for $1,400, according to the article, was sent directly to
James McGregory, the superintendent, to speed construction of a five-story
structure.

Five years later, complaining of precarious apartments, ''worthless'' fire
escapes, and the recent collapse of a condemned wall through the roof of St.
Andrew's Church, another Times reporter suggested that the department be
abolished altogether. It was, he wrote, a ''mere refuge for rapacious
politicians'' that ''is continually imperiling not only the property, but the
lives, of the tens of thousands it is paid to protect.''

The headline that time? ''The Building Department: Its Rottenness Exposed.''

The current crisis seems to have resulted less from illegality than from
bureaucratic missteps, poor public relations and a spate of fatalities at
construction sites -- 13 this year alone. In all fairness to Ms. Lancaster, she
has been praised for modernizing the city's confusing building code, imposing
integrity standards and making records accessible to the public.

Nonetheless, her departure is another black mark on an agency that has always
lurched from slip-up into scandal and from scandal into slip-up, not unlike the
troubled sibling in a prominent family who has problems with drink.

The truest answer to the question of why this agency seems habitually in
difficulty is also the simplest, experts say: It is money -- and especially
money earned from real estate -- that makes New York City go around.

''When you have a surge of activity and you don't have a corresponding increase
of staff, there's a lot of pressure to move things along,'' said Richard T.
Anderson, president of the New York Building Congress, a trade group.
''Developers will do anything to get the necessary permits. Time is money; it's
the same old song.''

In recent years, five department employees have been arrested in connection with
their work. In 2002, however, 19 of the city's 24 plumbing inspectors --
including the chief inspector and the top supervisors in Manhattan, Brooklyn,
Queens and the Bronx -- were charged with extorting hundreds of thousands of
dollars, sometimes in payments of $50 each, to approve projects throughout the
city.

Even in New York, where palms are often moisturized with cash, the scope of the
case was startling: at one point, nearly two-thirds of the plumbing inspectors
who work for the city were under arrest. All 19 eventually pleaded guilty in the
case.

In 1996, 42 elevator inspectors were suspended, and 18 eventually pleaded guilty
to federal charges, including extortion.

Many years before, when some building inspectors were charged with conspiring
with real-estate interests to make a quick profit in crooked condemnation
proceedings, the district attorney in Manhattan told an anxious press: ''This is
the first inning of the investigation. It is at an early stage.''

His name was Frank Hogan, and the date was Nov. 7, 1957.

Northstar 'a happy horse' one year after attack

BYLINE: Valerie Myers, Erie Times-News, Pa.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 404 words


Aug. 11--UNION CITY -- One year after he was set on fire in his northern
Crawford County pasture, Northstar still isn't back home.

But the 7-year-old painted quarter horse is getting closer.

Northstar now is recuperating at a northwestern Pennsylvania farm. And he's
doing well enough that he could come home soon, Jessie Woodworth said. Woodworth
and her husband, Bob, own the horse.

"He's been getting out and grazing and acting more like a horse," Jessie
Woodworth said. "He's pretty happy."

Northstar will be happier when a new "prosthetic saddle" arrives. The saddle,
made from a cast of the horse's back and withers, will protect recent skin
grafts when he rolls in the dirt or grass.

"It's what horses do -- they love to roll," said Jeanne May, of the Northstar
Equine Foundation, an Internet-based organization that's raised money for
Northstar's care. "Right now, someone has to be right there with him when he's
turned out so that he doesn't roll and damage tissue and skin grafts on his
withers."

Jim McGinness, of J.G. McGinness Prosthetics & Orthotics in Norristown, took on
the job of manufacturing the unique prosthetic. Its considerable weight will be
distributed to parts of the horse's body that are healed, May said.

McGinness donated the special saddle. Erie Pack & Ship, on upper Peach Street,
is shipping it to Northstar for only the cost of gasoline, said May, of Erie.

"This horse just seems to have an uncanny ability to attract the right people at
the right time," May said. "What he needs, people come down the pike to
provide."

Northstar is also receiving the "low-tech" care that he needs now, after months
of groundbreaking care at the Ohio State University veterinary school, May said.

"He's being cared for by old-time horse people who hose him off three times a
day and treat his grafts" with oils and Castile soap, she said. "It's allowed
the work done at Ohio State to be really successful."

Northstar was doused with accelerant and set on fire in his pasture in Athens
Township on Aug. 25, and has battled his way back from not only burns, but
repeated skin grafts, pneumonia and a staph infection.

"He's one very tough boy, let me tell you," Jessie Woodworth said.

· Beckman Coulter (Fullerton, California) introduced the Coulter AcT 5diff AL
(Auto Loader) hematology analyzer. The AcT 5diff AL features an automated sample
loader that reduces manual sample loading for clinical laboratories. The
integrated autoloader accommodates up to 10 cassettes (each holding 10 13 x 75
mm sample tubes), increasing overall workflow efficiency, saving time and
reducing operational costs, the company said. The AcT 5diff AL features
five-part differential analysis technology, providing more information and
faster results than two-part, three-part or manual methods. The system employs
Absorbance cytochemistry and Volume (AcV) technology, which accurately measures
lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils. Samples can be
re-tested according to user-selected criteria such as flags or voteouts, or when
they exceed specific parameter limits. The instrument offers random-access
testing for greater workflow flexibility and reagent conservation and features
software that enables users to flag test results based on user-defined flagging
limits.

· Biophan Technologies (Rochester, New York) reported the results of the recent
testing of one of its technologies developed to make implantable devices, their
metal wire leads and other metal objects used in surgical procedures safe in a
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) environment. Currently, MRI examination is
difficult to obtain for individuals who have implanted pacemakers and similar
devices due to the potential for heating associated with tissue damage.
Pacemaker patients also are subject to rapid heartbeat in an MRI device as a
result of induced voltages in the pacing lead. Two tests of Biophan's
technologies were conducted in active MRI imaging systems at imaging centers
located in New York. Results of the first test showed the reduction of thermal
heating caused by an MRI machine on a metal wire similar to a pacing lead that
is protected by one of Biophan's MRI technologies. The control sample was heated
over 22 degrees centigrade in less than one minute. With the Biophan technology
added, the heating was reduced to about 1 degree centigrade, below the level
that can cause tissue damage and well within FDA safety guidelines. The second
test showed a reduction of 89% in the electrical energy induced in a metal
object by the MRI radio frequency field after Biophan MRI safety technology was

· CardioTech International (Woburn, Massachusetts) said it has completed
preparations for initiation of a human clinical trial for its CardioPass
coronary artery bypass graft. The trial is scheduled to be initially conducted
in Brazil, and will involve several clinical institutions. CardioTech is now
entering the patient-recruitment phase, and expects to perform the first human
implant during the current quarter. CardioTech said it is now one of only two
companies in human trials with a synthetic coronary artery bypass graft.
Clinical endpoints for the pilot study are major adverse clinical events,
myocardial infarction, urgent/elective intervention or death. Secondary outcomes
to be measured are patency rate, quality of life and freedom from angina. The
CardioPass graft is manufactured from CardioTech's ChronoFlex biodurable
polyurethane. The graft is intended for use as a synthetic substitute for the
saphenous vein that is commonly used to bypass diseased coronary arteries that
have become narrowed or blocked, eliminating the need for a second simultaneous
operation, the company said.

· Cell Genesys (South San Francisco, California) reported the initiation of a
multicenter Phase I/II clinical trial of CG7870, an oncolytic virus therapy for
the treatment of early-stage prostate cancer, administered in combination with
radiation therapy. This trial, which was prompted by encouraging results from a
previous Phase I/II clinical trial evaluating CG7870 as a single agent, is
designed to evaluate various treatment regimens combining intraprostatically
administered CG7870 with external beam radiation therapy. The trial is expected
to enroll up to approximately 25 newly diagnosed patients who have not received
any prior treatment for their prostate cancer and will be conducted at up to
five medical centers in the U.S.  Depending on the results of this initial
combination therapy trial, Cell Genesys expects to develop CG7870 as a less
toxic alternative to radiation seed therapy in newly diagnosed, intermediate- to
high-risk prostate cancer patients.

· Cytel Software (Cambridge, Massachusetts) reported the release of East v3.0,
software for the design, simulation and interim monitoring of clinical trials.
The company said its software is the most comprehensive and easy to use product
of its kind, and will help sponsor companies increase the efficiency, accuracy
and flexibility of their Phase II, III and IV clinical trials. East v3.0 has the
power to perform complicated calculations easily, quickly and accurately, and
its simulation capability and visual display of information will help clinicians
and statisticians communicate effectively and improve their decision making
process, Cytel said.

· St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (Memphis, Tennessee) said its
investigators have discovered numerous genes that alter their level of activity
in characteristic patterns in response to specific chemotherapy treatments. The
genes were identified in the leukemia cells of children undergoing chemotherapy
for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Researchers used gene expression
analysis to study levels of activity of more than 9,600 genes in the cancerous
white blood cells of these children before and after treatment with methotrexate
(MTX) and/or mercaptopurine (MP). Based on their observations of the activity of
the 9,600 genes in response to treatment, the investigators identified 124 genes
whose changes in expression differed depending on which treatment the child
received. Researchers observed marked differences depending on whether the drugs
were given alone or in combination. The response of these particular genes
suggests that leukemia cells react to drug treatment in very specific ways,
depending on the treatment, the hospital said. Another important finding was the
way that leukemia cells responded when the two drugs were given together.

'There are no words when a miracle like this happens'

BYLINE: Boitumelo Ntsoko

SECTION: HEALTH

LENGTH: 394 words


PIPPIE Kruger's advanced skin graft operation was declared a success last night
after a painstaking procedure to remove the bandages covering the burned
toddler's skin.
 "We are happy to say the operation was a success," said Doctor Ridwan Mia, the
plastic surgeon who performed the operation on the three-year-old at the Netcare
Garden City Hospital last week.


 "Slightly over 90% of the skin graft has taken, while there are small islands
that have not taken. But skin will grow in from surrounding areas," said Mia.
 He said the graft was still fragile but blood supply to the toddler's skin was
developing.
 "We are now putting splints in place to keep her in position and hopefully we
can move to the next phase of rehabilitation," he said, adding that he hoped
Pippie's rehabilitation - which would include speech and occupational therapy as
well as physiotherapy - could begin by the middle of next week.
 If all goes well, she could be discharged in two or three weeks.
 Mia said they would slowly start waking Pippie this week. "The idea is to get
her moving and start weaning her off the ventilator."
 Pippie's mother, Anice Kruger, was with her daughter at the beginning of the
marathon procedure last night, while her father, Ernie, waited anxiously
outside.
 At 6.30pm the medical staff came out to show them the first picture of the
procedure. "It's completely mended and there is no indication of infection.
First one perfect, 28 more [dressings] to go," said Anice. "There are no words a
parent can say when a miracle like this happens. I'm blessed."
 Erwin Kruger said he was excited, but "it also feels like a calmness has come
over me".
 Pippie sustained third-degree burns to 80% of her body at a braai on New Year's
Eve and has been in hospital ever since.
 She was sedated throughout the procedure.
 Last week, about 40 pieces of skin grown in the US from samples taken from her
body were grafted onto her back, face, chest, arms and legs. The cultivated skin
had a 24-hour shelf life and was rushed to Garden City after a 21-hour flight
from Boston.
 Scientists at Sanofi Biosurgery, in Boston, where the skin was grown, told the
Sunday Times that Pippie had become the first African to have a "quilt of her
own skin".

Washington: Why Many Vein Grafts Fail

LENGTH: 543  words

DATELINE: Washington


National Institute of Health, The Government of USA has issued the following
news release:

Researchers identified a biological pathway that contributes to vein graft
failure following bypass surgery. The finding points to potential drugs that
might help to reduce such failures.Bypass surgery is a common procedure in the
United States. A healthy artery or vein from elsewhere in the body is grafted
onto arteries that feed the heart to bypass clogged vessels and restore blood
flow. The great saphenous vein--the large vein running up the length of the
leg--is often used as a bypass due to its size and the ease of removing a small
segment.

After grafting, implanted veins remodel to become more arterial. However, the
remodeling can go awry and the vein can become too thick, resulting in clogged
blood flow. About 40% of vein grafts fail within 18 months of the operation.

To better understand how this process goes awry, a team led by Dr. Manfred Boehm
of NIH's National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) examined veins from
mouse models of bypass surgery. The scientists suspected that a process known as
endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition, or EndoMT, may cause the inside of the
vein to over-thicken. During EndoMT, endothelial cells that line the inner
surface of the vein proliferate and convert into more fibrous and muscle-like
cells. These mesenchymal cells begin to accumulate on the inner wall, narrowing
the vessel. The inner walls of the vein become too thick, slowing or blocking
the blood flow that the graft was intended to restore.

To study this process, the scientists used mice in which endothelial cells
express a protein that can be used to track their fate. The results were
published on March 12, 2014, in Science Translational Medicine.

By tracing the fate of endothelial cells, the researchers showed that
endothelial-derived cells contribute to vein thickening through EndoMT. They
discovered that the process was triggered by transforming growth factor beta
(TGF-beta), a secreted protein known to control the proliferation and maturation
of several cell types.

TGF-beta, the scientists found, becomes highly expressed just a few hours after
graft surgery. Inhibition of the TGF-beta signaling pathway reduced overgrowth
in the grafted veins.

The team examined human veins taken from failed bypass operations and found
corroborating evidence for a role for EndoMT in human graft failure. In
short-term grafts (less than 1 year), many of the cells inside the human veins
displayed both endothelial and mesenchymal cell characteristics, while in
long-term grafts (more than 6 years) the cells on the inner wall were primarily
mesenchymal in nature.

"This study shows for the first time that endothelial cells in the vein directly
contribute to blood vessel narrowing following a vein graft," Boehm says. "Now
that we better understand the mechanism that causes the abnormal thickening, we
can look for therapeutic strategies to attenuate it and reduce the number of
bypass reoperations we need to perform each year."

Certain drugs that are known to inhibit TGF-beta are a possible treatment
strategy. However, more studies will be needed before any clinical studies can
begin.

Financings Roundup: Sant Ventures boosts size of most recent fund to $139
million

LENGTH: 372 words

Staff Report

Santé Ventures (Austin,Texas) boosted the size of its latest fund to $139
million, according to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The firm
collected the capital for the fund from 17 investors.

Santé Ventures, founded in 2006, said that it invests exclusively in early-stage
companies developing medical technologies or healthcare delivery models. In
2007, the firm closed its $130 million debut fund.

Nearly three years ago the company reported receiving $91.6 million from 13
investors for the second fund, which increased to $133 million last year, SEC
filings indicate.

In other financing news, Cerapedics (Westminister, Colorado), an orthobiologics
company focused on developing its proprietary synthetic small peptide (P-15)
technology platform, reported the closing of a $9 million venture debt financing
from GE Capital, Healthcare Financial Services (Norwalk, Connecticut). The loan,
which does not include equity or warrant coverage, will support general business
operations for Cerapedics, including the advancement of Cerapedics' U.S.
regulatory process.

"With the recent presentation of our preliminary outcomes data for i-FACTOR
Peptide Enhanced Bone Graft, we are pleased to announce closing of this loan
agreement with GE Capital, which will position us to continue our progress
toward US regulatory approval and commercialization in the months ahead," said
Jeffrey Marx, PhD, president/CEO at Cerapedics.

On March 11, Cerapedics unveiled preliminary outcomes data from a FDA
investigational device exemption clinical trial for i-FACTOR Peptide Enhanced
Bone Graft in anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) procedures. The
study was a randomized, controlled, multicenter, prospective trial for
single-level instrumented ACDF procedures inside of a structural allograft ring.
Preliminary analysis of the results indicated that treatment with i-FACTOR bone
graft met the pre-specified primary endpoints.

"We are looking forward to building a strong relationship with GE Capital and
are excited to move forward with their support. We are confident that the future
for Cerapedics and for i-FACTOR Peptide Enhanced Bone Graft will be extremely
auspicious," said Glen Kashuba, CEO at Cerapedics.

Avita completes first US ReCell treatment

LENGTH: 296 words


Avita Medical Ltd says that the first US-based treatment of a patient with
ReCell spray-on skill cells under the approved FDA protocol has been conducted.

A burns victim was treated at Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Burn Center
in Winston-Salem, North Carolina on May 27, 2010.

The patient presented with burns on both arms. The burn sites were arbitrarily
labelled A and B. In a blind test, one site was assigned treatment with ReCell
and the other served as a control and was treated with split thickness skin
graft, the current standard of care. After seven days the ReCell graft site had
100% take and was fully re-epithelialised (covered with new skin with no open
areas or blisters). The control site had 75-80% take with 20-25% of the area
having unhealed open interstices. The ReCell donor site was 100% closed and
fully re-epithelialised whereas the control traditional graft donor site on the
thigh remained open and slightly oozy with numerous bleeding spots. In
self-reporting of pain, the patient reported 0/10 pain at the ReCell site and
10/10 pain at the traditional control site.

CEO Dr William Dolphin says the company is pleased but not surprised by the
outcome. "The ReCell Spray-On-Skin technology offers great benefits to the
patient and clinicians and has the potential to deliver significant cost savings
to the healthcare system," Dr Dolphon said.

Study finds Cook's Biodesign graft causes less post-op pain

LENGTH: 758 words

Medical Device Daily Staff Writer

Results from a clinical study led by Luca Ansaloni, MD, showed Cook Medical's
(Bloomington, Indiana) Biodesign Inguinal Hernia Graft causes less postoperative
pain and discomfort while creating a repair as durable as synthetic mesh when
used in Lichtenstein's hernioplasty procedures, the company reported this week.
As published in a recent issue of the American Journal of Surgery, the
three-year, 70-patient study determined that patients treated with Biodesign
Inguinal Hernia Graft experienced a lower level of postoperative pain as
compared with synthetic mesh-based procedures, Cook said.

The randomized, double-blind inguinal hernia study examined the efficacy of the
Biodesign graft in treating 35 men compared to 35 men treated with synthetic
mesh. Research findings showed that 11% of patients treated with synthetics
experienced chronic postoperative pain that limited daily activities, most often
resulting from the mesh characteristics as opposed to surgical technique. By
contrast, patients in the study treated with the Biodesign graft experienced a
lower degree of postoperative pain both at rest and when coughing or moving.
Additionally, at three-year follow-up no evidence of hernia recurrence was seen
in the study patients treated with the Biodesign graft, according to the
research.

Inguinal hernias occur when soft tissue, generally part of the intestine, forces
its way through a tear in the lower abdominal wall or through the inguinal canal
and creates a bulge that can be painful when coughing, bending or lifting heavy
objects. According to the National Institutes of Health, inguinal hernias are
more common in men and often develop as a result of the frequent heavy lifting,
coughing or straining. While hernias aren't necessarily dangerous themselves,
they can lead to life-threatening conditions if left untreated, Cook noted.

"Based on our research findings, biologic grafts are extremely effective when
treating inguinal hernias," said Ansaloni, a general surgeon at St.
Orsola-Malpighi University Hospital (Bologna, Italy). "Not only did [study]
patients recover quickly after receiving the Biodesign Inguinal Hernia Graft,
but they experienced less pain and discomfort as compared to patients who were
treated with synthetic mesh."

According to Cook, the Biodesign Inguinal Hernia Graft incorporates attributes
of a biologic graft - resistance to infection and complete remodeling - with the
added benefits of moderate price, ease-of-use and ample shelf life for on-site
availability. Upon deployment, the graft reinforces the repair of surrounding
tissue and, over time, communicates with the patient's body, signaling
surrounding tissue to grow across the scaffold where the repair is needed. The
Biodesign graft is designed specifically for reinforcing the inguinal floor and
designed to meet special challenges including resistance to infection,
encapsulation and erosion, the company said.

Last year Cook launched an informational microsite -  - for its Biodesign grafts
to provide abstracts of clinical studies, research articles, news, and treatment
success stories for the company's Biodesign products (Medical Device Daily, Oct.
19, 2009).

"The potential complications associated with the use of synthetic mesh in
treating inguinal hernias can cause a significant decrease in quality of life
for patients while also increasing procedural recovery time," said Andy Cron, VP
of Cook's surgery strategic business unit. "This study comes at a very important
time, as the medical field continues to debate the benefits of biologic and
synthetic treatment options. Dr. Ansaloni's research reinforces our efforts to
leverage biologic solutions that provide hernia patients with a natural, lasting
solution."

In June, Cook reported data that showed the Biodesign Hernia Graft is safe and
effective in treating chemotherapy patients suffering from hernias for which
synthetic mesh is not a viable option. According to that study, Biodesign is
particularly effective at treating high-risk patients with preoperative abnormal
wall morbidity, gastrointestinal perforation and those patients receiving
hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy or cytoreductive surgical procedures.
The graft also proved to reduce postoperative adhesions, reduce the risk of
surgical site infection and eliminate enterotomies of fragile bowel after
chemotherapy during subsequent surgeries in that study (MDD, June 30, 2009).

Tissue Bank Is Doubling Size

LIFELINK TO BUILD NEW FACILITY IN BRANDON AREA

By MICHAEL SASSO

The Tampa Tribune

TAMPA - A nonprofit group that collects organs, skin and bone tissue from the
deceased and transports them to needy patients will build a new $26.5 million
tissue bank in the Brandon area.

There, LifeLink Foundation staff will process bone tissue and ligament tissue
into smaller grafts that can be transplanted into patients, many of whom lose
bone tissue because of cancer, traumatic accidents and spinal surgery, LifeLink
spokeswoman Jennifer Krouse said Thursday.

LifeLink will build a 60,000-square-foot tissue bank in the Crosstown Center
business park off Falkenburg Road. It will replace LifeLink's existing tissue
bank off Waters Avenue in Tampa, which is half the size of the new facility.
Construction of the new building won't be finished until 2010, Krouse said, but
its completion should let the tissue bank add 20 employees to its current staff
of 85.

LifeLink also has an organ transplant facility on Bayshore Boulevard in Tampa,
across from Tampa General Hospital.

Last year, the LifeLink tissue bank fashioned bone tissue into 40,000 smaller
tissue grafts for transplant.

"One tissue donor could potentially impact the lives of 50 other people with
much smaller grafts," Krouse said.

From Tampa, the tissue bank serves western and Southwest Florida, Georgia and
Puerto Rico.

To pay for the new building, LifeLink is issuing up to $25 million in tax-exempt
bonds.

A public agency called the Hillsborough County Industrial Development Authority
is facilitating issuing the bonds so they can get tax-exempt status, but
LifeLink will be responsible for repaying them, development authority attorney
Tom Morrison said.

Government changes tune on drug death

BYLINE: Sue Reinert

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 12

The Patriot Ledger

When Jamie Ann Jackson died after participating in a federal drug study,
government doctors said she succumbed to a rare disorder linked to the
medication she was taking.

Now, six years later, the government is arguing that the 42-year-old nurse did
not die that way. The claim is part of its defense against a malpractice suit
filed by Jackson's family.

A federal judge will soon decide what caused the Plainville resident's death in
June 1999. The ruling will determine whether the lawsuit can go forward.

In 1998, Jackson started taking two potent chemotherapy drugs that suppress the
immune system as part of a National Institutes of Health (NIH) study of
treatment for lupus. Lupus, a life-threatening disease that primarily affects
young women, was damaging her kidneys, and conventional drug treatment was not
working.

The label for one of the drugs, Fludara, warned that the drug had, in rare
instances, caused graft-versus-host disease after blood transfusions. Doctors
should consider giving patients blood treated with radiation to prevent the
disease, the label said.

Graft-versus-host disease occurs when immune system cells from a blood donor
attack a recipient whose immunity is weak. The disorder kills more than 90
percent of victims when it is caused by a transfusion.

Doctors running the study did not notify participants or their physicians of the
drug-label warning until after Jackson died. Jackson had received untreated
blood transfusions at Caritas Southwood Hospital.

NIH officials told The Patriot Ledger in 2000 that researchers had no reason to
alert participants because the previous problems occurred in leukemia patients.

At a federal court hearing in Boston last week, Assistant U.S. Attorney James J.
McGovern and Curtis Diedrich, a lawyer for Jackson's Norwood doctor, said
Jackson's autopsy showed no evidence of graft-versus-host disease. NIH doctors
had previously diagnosed the disease based on her symptoms, McGovern said.

"You can have a clinical diagnosis, but pathology is definitive," he said.

Experts for the government say Jackson probably died from a rare immune system
reaction that had nothing to do with the drug.

Michael Mone, the lawyer for Jackson's husband, said the autopsy showed markers
from a blood donor in Jackson's blood. Such evidence "is an absolute marker of
graft-versus-host," he said.

Even if the government's pathologist disagrees, "it's never been the law that
the only way to make a diagnosis is on pathology," Mone said.

In 2003, NIH researchers published an article about Jackson's death in the
leading medical journal on blood transfusions and urged doctors to consider
giving irradiated blood to all patients taking Fludara, not just leukemia
patients.

New evidence shows that transfusion recipients can have blood markers from a
donor without getting sick, the doctors said in an affidavit submitted in the
case.

Still, the physicians said, they "felt a responsibility to publish her case even
as a possible cause of (transfusion-associated graft-versus host disease) in
order to alert and inform practicing physicians" of the risks to patients taking
Fludara.

If Chief U.S. District Court Judge William Young decides that Jackson did not
die of graft-versus-host disease, the family will lose its lawsuit.

If the suit goes forward, the Jacksons will still have to prove that the NIH and
Jackson's local specialist, Dr. Philip S. Weinstein in Norwood, did not provide
adequate care. Sue Reinert may be reached at sreinert@ledger.com.

Medallist says graft runs deep

OLYMPICS: An Australian Olympic medallist who was involved in Melbourne's bid
for the 1996 Games says graft and corruption ran deep in the Olympic movement.
Peter Norman, 200metres silver medallist at the 1968 Mexico City Games, said
bribery has existed for so long that International Olympic Committee members
expected "inducements" when they visited a bidding city. "I believe that graft
and corruption runs fairly deep on various levels of the Olympic organisation,"
Norman said during the Asian Games in Bangkok. Norman is in Bangkok promoting
Melbourne's sporting facilities as training venues for the 2000 Sydney Olympics.

Cleric's visit leads to clash

Pakistani police fired tear gas yesterday to disperse crowds of supporters of a
prominent anti-government cleric who was due to arrive in the country to lead a
self-proclaimed revolution against Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. Media reports
said about 2000 supporters of Tahirul Qadri, who is usually based in Canada,
clashed with police outside an airport near the Pakistani capital Islamabad,
where the cleric was due to land at 7am yesterday. Amid chaotic scenes at
Benazir Bhutto International Airport, it was not immediately clear if his plane
had landed as planned. Police cordoned off major roads leading to the airport
with cargo containers and blocked mobile phone services to prevent protesters
from communicating with each other.

Migrant flights shelved

The United States Border Patrol have cancelled flights scheduled to bring nearly
300 Central American migrants from south Texas to California for processing, but
the plans could be reinstated, an official said yesterday. It was unclear why
today's flights for San Diego and El Centro, about 161 kilometres east of San
Diego, were shelved, said Ralph DeSio, a spokesman for Customs and Border
Protection, the Border Patrol's parent agency.

Arrest ordered for senator

A Philippine anti-graft court has ordered the arrest of a second senator, one of
three members of the powerful Senate to be indicted on a charge of receiving
huge kickbacks from government development and anti-poverty funds. Senator
Jinggoy Estrada, son of a deposed president, has denied any wrongdoing but said
yesterday that he would surrender to the police accompanied by his parents and
family. He has been charged before the Sandiganbayan special anti-graft court of
pocketing 183 million pesos (NZ$4.8m) in kickbacks, called plunder, and has also
been accused of violating the anti-graft law.

Soprano's slur sickens

A soprano has been dumped by Opera Australia after she was accused of labelling
homosexuals "sewage" and "faecal masses" in a post on her Facebook page against
a gay pride march in her home city in Georgia. The opera company said yesterday
that Tamar Iveri, who was to star in its production of Verdi's Otello, had been
released immediately from her contract. She was to have played the lead part of
Desdemona in the opera, due to open on July 5.

Sticky toffee pudding allure

A village in the Lake District has appeared on a list of the most desirable
places to visit. Cartmel, best known for its sticky toffee pudding and being on
a river whose name is made up entirely of vowels - Eea - has been ranked
alongside Cape Town, Athens and the Arctic Circle. Cartmel came 44th on the New
York Times list, between Nepal and Elsinore, Hamlet's home in Denmark. Its
people are largely baffled by the endorsement, but Cartmel's reputation is
gathering. Since chef Simon Rogan set up L'enclume, a double Michelin-starred
restaurant, two more of his establishments have followed. Cartmel is also noted
for its racecourse, where winning jockeys leave with a sticky toffee pudding,
and for stately home Holker Hall.

Biolab boss reassigned

The US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention has reassigned the director of
the bioterror lab behind the potential anthrax exposure of dozens of scientists
and staff, sources said, as the anthrax controversy intensified. Michael
Farrell, head of the centres' Bioterror Rapid Response and Advanced Technology
Laboratory, has been reassigned as the agency investigates the incident, two of
the centres' scientists said. The possible exposure has forced as many as 84
employees at the agency's Atlanta campus to get a vaccine or take powerful
antibiotics with known side effects to ward off potentially deadly anthrax
disease.

William Hamm, opened Atlanta plastic surgery clinic

BYLINE: Joel Groover

SECTION: LOCAL NEWS; Pg. 08D; Pg. 08D

LENGTH: 575 words


Dr. William G. Hamm, 96, who opened the first plastic surgery clinic in Atlanta,
corrected harelips and cleft palates in hundreds of children.

He trained with one of the founders of plastic surgery during the 1930s, and
helped develop a now-standard way to treat severe burns, the skin graft.

The Atlanta resident died of heart failure Saturday at Piedmont Hospital. The
graveside service will be at 11 a.m. Tuesday at Arlington Memorial Park,
followed by a 2 p.m. memorial service at All Saints Episcopal Church. H.M.
Patterson & Son, Spring Hill, is in charge of arrangements.

Born in Gainesville, Dr. Hamm rode in a horse and buggy as a child on house
calls with his father, a physician and surgeon.

Those experiences, including watching his father attend Confederate Gen. James
A. Longstreet on his deathbed, piqued Dr. Hamm's interest in medicine.

He graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Georgia in 1921, and
graduated with honors from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis
in 1925.

Dr. Hamm completed his general surgical training at Barnes Hospital in St.
Louis, then studied plastic and reconstructive surgery under Dr. Vilroy P.
Blair, a founder of the specialty.

During the 1930s, Dr. Hamm helped Dr. Blair and another Missouri surgeon write
the definitive paper on the split thickness skin graft, said Dr. Maurice J.
Jurkiewicz, an Atlanta plastic surgeon who worked with Dr. Hamm.

After the paper was published, the technique became a standard treatment for
severe burns.

"We're talking about the basic skin graft technique," he said. "Not only did it
become standard, it saved countless lives."

After moving to Atlanta during the mid-1930s, Dr. Hamm opened a clinic and began
seeing patients and performing surgery at St. Joseph's and Egleston Children's
hospitals. In later years, he worked at Piedmont, Emory University, Grady
Memorial and Georgia Baptist hospitals.

Dr. Hamm, the first fully trained plastic surgeon in Atlanta, "was probably the
best trained individual plastic surgeon in the country when he moved here," Dr.
Jurkiewicz said. "He was the first general surgeon I'm aware of who had full
training in general surgery, followed by extensive training in plastic surgery."

During World War II, as head of plastic surgery at St. Alban's Hospital in New
York, Dr. Hamm operated on wounded Navy and Marine personnel. He also served in
West Africa, where he was assigned to a U.S. admiral helping Gen. Charles de
Gaulle win support for the Free French cause.

After the war, Dr. Hamm focused on adults with cancer of the face, mouth and
jaws, and children born with congenital deformities. He came to specialize in
helping children with harelips and cleft palates.

Those children usually needed speech training after surgery, and Dr. Hamm
referred families to the school his wife, the late Kitty Hamm, helped found in
1938. The school eventually grew to become the Atlanta Speech School.

Dr. Hamm belonged to several medical associations, and was a professor emeritus
of clinical surgery at Emory University. He retired during the early 1980s.

He was an avid baseball fan, and during the days of the Atlanta Crackers often
sat with the team's president, Earl Mann, during games at Ponce de Leon Park.

"He was a very, very kind physician," Dr. Jurkiewicz said. "He had an unassuming
grace and an uncommon generosity."

There are no immediate survivors.
