City Moves to Recover Delinquent Taxes

BYLINE: Darren Waggoner

SECTION: CCR - DEALS & PRICING Vol. 1 No. 1

LENGTH: 388  words


City officials in Hazard, Ky., are ramping up efforts to collect approximately
$200,000 in back taxes after sending out 1,100 letters to delinquent taxpayers
last week.

The goal of the program is to increase profits for the city, rectify any data
errors on the tax bills and inform Hazard residents that the city's
administration is making an effort to run the city "fairly and economically."

Most people receiving the letters have been delinquent for several years. If
they pay within 30 days of the date marked in the letter, they won't be
subjected to accumulated interest, prorated mailing costs and prorated attorney
fees.

The city isn't offering any sort of payment arrangements. According to Assistant
City Attorney Lori Reynolds, there are two reasons for this:

1) The debts are secured by a lien on the property. The lien over the property
gives no advantages to the city to accept payments.

2) It would be problematic for the city to keep up with payments, especially if
the taxpayer decides not to honor the payment arrangement because the city would
have to keep track of the interest, costs and fees.

The next step the city will take to collect the delinquent taxes will be a mass
collection lawsuit. Reynolds expects to have the mass case filed by the summer.
Under the mass collection lawsuit, the city will be able to file one lawsuit
with every delinquent bill added as a separate count, making the lawsuit under
one case number.

Once the lawsuit is filed, a list of the delinquent taxpayers will be published
in the local newspaper, The Hazard Herald, with the cost of doing so - per city
ordinance - prorated and added to the delinquent taxpayer's debt.

Before the city would move to foreclose on any property, banks and loan
companies that have mortgages or liens on the property will be notified of the
lawsuit to allow them to have a chance to pay off the debt. The taxpayer,
mortgage company, any lien-holder or others claiming interest in the property
can pay off the tax debt during the collection process.

Reynolds hopes that the delinquent property tax collection will net at least
$125,000 for the city.

Mayor Jimmy Lindon and the city have said they will try to give taxpayers enough
time to pay off the delinquent tax debt before filling the mass collection
lawsuit. Hazard's population is estimated at 5,500.

Bill collector targets Reading residents delinquent on housing fees

BYLINE: Don Spatz, Reading Eagle, Pa.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 287 words


June 06--Didn't pay that long overdue housing fee during the city's early 2013
amnesty? The collector's going to come knocking.

The city has just turned the first wave of the delinquent bills, totaling about
$1 million, over to its newly hired collector, National Recovery Agency in
Harrisburg, which will impose a 15 percent penalty on top of what's owed.

Matthew Bembenick, city director of administrative services, said there's a
total of $2.5 million in unpaid housing fees and quality-of-life tickets to be
sent to the collector.

He said the $1 million turned over to National Recovery in the first wave
focuses on the larger dollar amounts, and were the first batch to be verified as
accurate by the individual departments that generated them.

He declined to project how much money the agency will collect for the city, but
said he would wait to see how the company performs.

Mayor Vaughn D. Spencer had run the amnesty offer from mid-December to
mid-February: Pay the original bill, and the city waives the late fees. Don't,
and the bill goes to the collector.

"We know who you are, and we want to give you a chance to come in and pay," he
said at a December press conference. "If not, we will come and get you."

Slightly more than half the 22,300 outstanding bills got paid, and the city
gained $611,000 and waived nearly $93,000 in penalties.

Last summer, the city ran a per capita and business tax amnesty that raised
$488,000.

Those who didn't pay up then were turned over to a different collector, Portnoff
Law Associates.

Who owes, and how much, may come as a big surprise;
It's not so E-Z to collect unpaid bills: $300B last year in federal money; $60B
for states

BYLINE: Dennis Cauchon

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 1A

Real estate developer Jack Blumenfeld went bankrupt in 1991, leaving millions of
dollars in unpaid taxes and loans.

Today, New Jersey lists him as the state's sixth-biggest tax delinquent, owing
$1.1 million. An Internal Revenue Service tax lien says Blumenfeld owes more
than $1.6 million in federal taxes.

Where is Blumenfeld today?

The 81-year-old developer lives in the same oceanfront home near Atlantic City
where he's lived since his glory days. He has asked local authorities for
permission to build a two-story addition and swimming pool to the
5,400-square-foot home, now valued at $1.8 million, according to local tax
records.

Blumenfeld says he's broke; the house is owned by a management company run by
his son. Every month, he says, the IRS takes $200 out of his Social Security
check.

The IRS estimates that 21% of federal individual income taxes go unpaid each
year -- about $300 billion last year. States lost about $60 billion in such
taxes, $6.5 billion in California alone.

As Tuesday's tax deadline approaches, Americans are settling accounts on $1.5
trillion in federal and state income taxes for 2007.

But what about those who don't pay? Who are they? Do they get away with it?

USA TODAY examined the cases of several hundred major tax delinquents -- those
who owe $100,000 or more -- to analyze who they are, why they haven't paid and
whether the money is collectible. Among them are celebrities, investment
bankers, lawyers, doctors, embezzlers, car dealers and many seemingly successful
business people who continue to operate publicly as if all is well.

The IRS declined to provide a list of the federal government's largest tax
delinquents, citing privacy rules. However, the names and the amounts owed are
scattered across the nation in 4,100 courthouses and town halls, where tax liens
are filed. The IRS files more than 600,000 tax liens every year.

USA TODAY examined the federal tax liens filed in several wealthy ZIP codes,
including those for Beverly Hills and Malibu, Calif., and Greenwich, Conn.

Hundreds of seemingly wealthy people -- company presidents, former soap opera
stars, top-selling real estate agents -- live in multimillion-dollar homes yet
have huge tax problems.

"What amazes me is how many people put themselves forward as pillars of the
community and great philanthropists, yet they don't pay their taxes," Georgia
Revenue Commissioner Bart Graham says.

How it gets started

For some, the trouble starts with divorce or gambling or a business mistake. For
others, it's a love of money and hatred of taxes.

Graham was an Atlanta banker before becoming Georgia's chief tax collector.

He knows some tax debtors personally and is familiar with their lifestyles,
homes, second homes and other assets. "People will do almost anything to make
sure friends don't see a change in lifestyle, and that 'anything' includes not
paying taxes," he says.

Why don't rich people pay?

"They realize they owe taxes," says Dennis Brager, a Los Angeles tax lawyer.
"It's just that from their perspective, they have more pressing obligations."

Tax delinquents often blame the government for part or all of their problems.
Penalties and interest on unpaid taxes are so punitive, they say, that it's
almost impossible to dig out of a hole.

William Livingston, an immigration attorney who specializes in mail-order
brides, says a $20,000 tax problem from 20 years ago has swelled to nearly
$300,000 owed to California today.

"There's no reasoning with these people," the San Dimas, Calif., resident says
of state tax collectors.

His  business -- bringing brides here from Russia and Ukraine -- is struggling.
His own mail-order marriage didn't work out, so he's a single parent living in a
small apartment with a son, he says.

"Most of my stuff is out of the country, anyway, where (tax collectors) can't
touch it," Livingston says. "I can retire abroad, and California can put me on
any (tax delinquent) list they want."

'Doing all we can'

Tax prosecutions are rare: 1,423 federal indictments last year; 235 million tax
returns were filed, the IRS reports. Tax collectors rely mostly on automation:
garnishing wages, seizing bank accounts and filing tax liens on property.

"We're doing all we can," says Kathy Petronchak, IRS commissioner for small
business collections. She says the IRS is collecting more money with fewer
employees than a decade ago.

The IRS collected $32 billion in back taxes and penalties in 2007, up from $21
billion in 1998. "We use our resources as efficiently as possible," Petronchak
says.

Today, houses are seldom seized. The IRS sold country singer Willie Nelson's
home and possessions in 1991 to help settle a $16.7 million tax bill. A 1998
law, designed to curb abuses, made it harder for the IRS to seize property.

Property ownership can be hard to prove, too. People in tax trouble often
transfer assets to relatives and trusts.

Even if the transfers can be challenged, the process is expensive and
time-consuming.

Jack Blumenfeld's beachfront house is now owned by EB Realty Management Corp.,
run by his son Eric. In sworn testimony before the local planning board last
year, Jack Blumenfeld testified he had lived in the house since 1964.

In an interview, Blumenfeld says he gave the house to his children many years
ago, long before he filed for bankruptcy. His son pays the taxes, he says.

The developer says he went broke when a plan to build a hotel and casino in
Atlantic City fell apart.

"I lost everything," he says. "The bankruptcy judge absolved me of all debts,
except taxes."

Blumenfeld blames the bankruptcy trustee for not paying the tax bill. "He had
enough dollars to pay the taxes, but he chose not to do so," Blumenfeld says.
"The bottom line is, I honestly think I don't owe them."

He says the government mean-spiritedly pursues him because it believes that he's
hiding assets. "They've examined me upside, inside out and never found anything.
They think I did something underhanded, which I did not."

Attorney Michael Zindler, who represented the  trustee, says the developer had
many assets in sons' names.  "They fought us every step of the way," Zindler
recalls.

The  trustee recovered most assets -- but not the beachfront home, next to the
boardwalk in Ventnor City, N.J., Zindler says. "We tried to get the house, but
the judge wouldn't give it to us."

Some high profiles

Many tax delinquents live openly and prosperously for years, even decades, while
owing millions of dollars in taxes.

Singer Dionne Warwick owes $2.7 million in state taxes, according to the
California Franchise Tax Board, which collects the state's income tax. The IRS
has placed more than $1 million in tax liens against her for unpaid federal
taxes. Public records show that her tax troubles started in 1990 or earlier.

Since then, Warwick has hosted a popular infomercial for the $3.99-per-minute
Psychic Friends Network from 1993 through 1998. She maintains a busy recording
and concert schedule, including tours this year in Europe and South America. In
January, she was robbed of jewelry worth more than $100,000 in a hotel room in
Rome. She performed Saturday near Dallas, her website says.

Why is the government unable to collect all taxes due from a five-time Grammy
winner generating significant cash flow?

The IRS and the state of California declined to comment, citing privacy rules.
Her manager, Henry Carr, said: "I can't talk about it. Very sorry." Warwick did
not respond to a letter requesting comment.

Other well-known delinquents:

*Dick Morris -- The former political adviser to Bill Clinton is a Fox News
analyst. The IRS filed a $1.5 million tax lien against him in 2003. The state of
Connecticut reports Morris owes $452,367 in back taxes and penalties.

Morris says he's reached an agreement with Connecticut and his name will be
removed from the next delinquency list. He says he is committed to paying his
taxes: "Following a difficult period in my life, I fell into arrears. But since
then, I have paid almost $3 million in state and federal taxes."

*Sinbad -- The comedian and actor -- whose full name is Sinbad Adkins -- owes
$2.1 million to the state of California, according to the California Franchise
Tax Board. The IRS filed a $416,870 tax lien against him in 2006. Other tax
liens against him date to 1994, when he starred in The Sinbad Show on the Fox
Network. His recent gigs include performing at last year's Wal-Mart shareholders
meeting and Saturday at the Hilton Casino in Atlantic City. Sinbad declined to
comment.

*Catalina Vasquez Villalpando -- The former treasurer of the United States --
her signature appears on paper currency printed during the administration of the
first President Bush -- owes $168,000 in taxes to Washington, D.C., the city
reports. She was convicted of tax evasion in 1994 for hiding income while in
office and served four months in prison. She did not respond to a request for
comment.

*O.J. Simpson -- The ex-football star, who lives in Florida, owes $1.5 million
in California taxes, the state says. Yale Galanter, an attorney for Simpson,
says he hasn't been notified of the debt. "Nobody has ever contacted me from the
state of California," Galanter told the Associated Press. He says Simpson  owns
no property or assets there.

Tax collection agencies are not permitted to discuss individual cases. They say
they are doing the best they can to collect taxes.

"Our collectors are out there every day trying to get this money," says John
Barrett, spokesman for the California Franchise Tax Board. He says the state
can't seize income earned outside the state. "If someone performs in Lake Tahoe
(Nev.), we can't garnish the money," he says. "If they perform in San Francisco,
we would be there waiting."

Dionne Warwick moved from Beverly Hills in the 1990s, and in recent years
reported living in her mother's home in Orange, N.J. That home was sold in 2006
after her mother's death. Warwick's current residence couldn't be determined.

California tax liens report Sinbad's mailing address as an office building in
the Chicago suburb of Oak Park, Ill. IRS tax liens list his residence as a
multimillion-dollar home in Hidden Hills, Calif., owned by his brother, Michael
Adkins.

On April 7, California reclassified more than 100 large tax debts as
uncollectible and removed the delinquents from its published list. Those taken
off the new list: Warwick, Sinbad and Livingston, the immigration attorney.

Trying new tactics

In an effort to shame tax delinquents into paying, 15 states -- California,
Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, New Jersey, North
Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Virginia, Washington and
Wisconsin -- and the District of Columbia have started publishing the names of
people the governments say owe large amounts of taxes. The inexpensive tactic
has worked.

Wisconsin collected more than $8 million after sending letters warning
delinquents that their names would be posted on the Internet. In Connecticut,
70% of the state's top 100 tax delinquents reached payment agreements after
getting such a letter.

Individuals and companies that prize respectability respond swiftly.

JPMorgan Chase sent a $115,000 check to Wisconsin the day after USA TODAY called
about an unpaid tax bill. The banking giant had a defunct partnership that
Wisconsin said owed $5 million.

"We owe some taxes and penalties but not $5 million," bank spokeswoman Christine
Holevas says. "This tax issue fell through the cracks, but we will work promptly
to settle it." The partnership was removed from the state's list after the
$115,000 check arrived.

Real-estate developer Kent Hoggan of Stockton, Calif., says he amended his tax
return Jan. 15 after appearing on California's list as owing $5.8 million in
back taxes. "I've had losses that would eliminate this tax liability," he says.

Some tax delinquents say they have no way to pay what they owe.

Disbarred attorney Michael Bledsoe of Elk Grove Village, Ill., is his state's
fifth-largest tax delinquent, owing $224,260.

He served time in prison for mishandling clients' money and tax evasion.

Now, he's trying to rebuild his life. After prison, he lived with his father and
at a friend's house. He's trying to start a career in sales.

"I lost everything," he says. "How do I pay this?"

Sometimes they are just wrong

The size of tax debts on the published lists can be overstated -- or plain
wrong. Dinah White of Fort Atkinson, Wis., says she owes $300,000, not the $1.3
million the state claims. "Where they got that number, who knows?" she says.

Even innocent people have a hard time getting off the list:

*Al Copeland, founder of the Popeyes fried chicken chain, was listed  as
Georgia's second-largest tax delinquent, owing $5.5 million. The giant
accounting firm KPMG tried for more than a year to get Copeland off the
delinquent list.

Copeland, a flamboyant New Orleans icon, died of cancer March 23. Georgia
mistakenly thought the life-long Louisiana resident lived in Georgia during the
1990s, says Grant Coleman, his tax attorney.

After an inquiry from USA TODAY, the state reviewed the case, removed Copeland's
name and canceled his tax liens.

*Bruce McNall is the former owner of the Los Angeles Kings hockey team and a
movie producer (Weekend at Bernie's). He pleaded guilty in 1994 to defrauding
$236million from banks.

The California Board of Equalization says he owes  $7.3 million for unpaid sales
tax on horses.

"That's an old debt that I thought was released in bankruptcy," McNall says.
Bankruptcy trustee Todd Neilson says McNall is right -- and the state is wrong.
The trustee says the state was awarded $250,000 after a trial to settle the tax
debt, and that amount has been paid.

*Molly Wotring, a part-time elementary school worker in Hodges, S.C., typed her
name in Google for fun last month. She was surprised to learn she was the
fifth-biggest tax delinquent in South Carolina.

The state claimed she owed $225,253 in income taxes for the years 2000 to 2004,
when she lived in Ohio. She says she got a cold reception when she called the
taxpayer assistance hotline.

"I tried to tell the lady on the phone. She wasn't very nice," Wotring says.

On April 4, she went unannounced to the local tax collection office, armed with
her old Ohio tax returns. An auditor apologized, she says. She is now off the
list.

LATE TAXPAYERS TO FACE PENALTIES OUTSTANDING REAL-ESTATE BILLS TOTAL $31, 775

BYLINE: Maura Salsich Post-Dispatch Special Correspondent

SECTION: ZONE SOUTH; Pg. 4

LENGTH: 355 words


City Collector Marguerite Wilburn showed a list of delinquent 1991
real-estatetax bills totaling $31,775.57 to the Valley Park Board of Aldermen,
and City Attorney Eric Martin said delinquent bills go back as far as 1984.
''Unbelievable,'' was Martin's description of the backlog.  ''I want to know
who's going to go out and collect these bills,'' said Alderman Fritz Wilson, 4th
Ward, at the board's meeting Monday night.  ''Just publishing a list doesn't get
things done.'' Martin said that when a tax bill was delinquent for more than
three years, St. Louis County has a public auction of the property to pay off
the debt.  Wilburn said bills for 1991 are delinquent after Dec. 31, 1991. She
said she had not compiled a list of delinquent bills before 1991 but would do so
at the board's request.  Wilson said, ''Her (Wilburn's) predecessor apparently
did not do his job.'' The board approved the action of the Finance, Ways and
Means Committee to delegate authority to St. Louis County to collect real-estate
taxes for the city.  ''It will go a lot quicker if the county does it,'' said
Wilburn. ''Before, the county would print the bills and we would have to hand
type trash fees on each one.'' The board approved the recommendation of the
committee that trash bills be added to water bills, which are issued by Valley
Park quarterly.  In other business, Alderman Gary Adams, 1st Ward, questioned
Paul Landwehr, director of community development, about efforts to pump water
out of flooded residential property. Landwehr said that approximately two inches
of rain had fallen in about 40 minutes May 22 and caused storm sewers to
overflow in four parts of Valley Park.  ''It's not unusual for storm sewers to
overflow with that much rain,'' Landwehr said in an interview.  Landwehr said
the excess water was being pumped into the woods but when construction of the
levee begins, retention ponds would be built inside the levee to contain excess
water.  Landwehr said that the levee was still being planned and construction
might begin next spring if Congress appropriates enough money in October for the
project.

Mississippi's non-current loans still high

BYLINE: Wally Northway

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 303  words


The latest Mortgage Monitor report released by Lender Processing Services Inc.
shows that the total number of delinquent loans was 21.3 percent higher than the
same period last year.

Although the data showed a small 1.45 percent seasonal decline in delinquencies
from Jan. 2010 to Feb. 2010 month-end, the national delinquency rate still stood
at 10.2 percent. The report is based on data as of Feb. 2010 month-end.

The nation's foreclosure inventories reached record highs. February's
foreclosure rate of 3.31 percent represented a 51.1 percent year-over-year
increase. The percentage of new problem loans also remains at a five-year high.
The total number of non-current first-lien mortgages and REO properties is now
more than 7.9 million loans. Furthermore, the percentage of new problem loans is
also at its highest level in five years. More than 1.1 million loans that were
current at the beginning of January 2010 were already at least 30 days
delinquent or in foreclosure by February 2010 month-end.

As a result of the federal government's Home Affordable Modification Program
(HAMP), delinquent loans that were modified and that remained current through
HAMP's three-month trial period - called "cures-to-current" - have increased.
Advanced delinquency rolls, however, remain elevated from a historical
perspective.

Other key results from LPS' latest Mortgage Monitor report include:

* Total U.S. loan delinquency rate - 10.2 percent

* Total U.S. foreclosure inventory rate - 3.3 percent

* Total U.S. non-current loan rate - 13.5 percent

* States with most non-current loans - Florida, Nevada, Arizona, Mississippi,
California, New Jersey, Georgia, Illinois, Ohio and Indiana

States with fewest non-current loans - North Dakota, South Dakota, Alaska,

A 20,000-square-foot piece of vacant Lake Erie shoreline in Hamburg is on the
auction block.

So, too, will be the site of an auto dealership on Transit Road in Depew.

And a former VFW property in North Collins.

Those - and about 190 other properties - are expected to attract the highest
bids Wednesday when Erie County holds its tax foreclosure auction at the Central
Library in downtown Buffalo.

It's the fourth such property foreclosure auction conducted during the term of
County Executive Mark C. Poloncarz. The three prior sales produced more than $18
million in delinquent property taxes and turned about 145 homes and businesses
back "into productive, taxpaying properties," county officials said.

"Erie County must stay active in the foreclosure process, both to work with
residents and homeowners who may need help to stay in their house and to work
with community groups looking to solve the problem of abandoned, tax-delinquent
properties that dot their neighborhoods," Poloncarz said.

In January, his administration filed a list of more than 500 tax-delinquent
parcels across Erie County with the County Legislature, an action that
administration officials said resulted in the collection of more than $7 million
in back taxes along with negotiated payment plans to assist "tax-delinquent
homeowners with legitimate reasons to save their properties."

"Auctioning the property is always a last resort, and only happens when we have
exhausted every other possible avenue for returning the property to the tax
rolls," said Joseph L. Maciejewski, county director real property tax services.
"We can work with individuals facing long-term unemployment or serious health
issues, but scofflaws or habitual filers for bankruptcy should be aware that
their tax-delinquent properties will be sold."

Among the properties on the list being offered for sale when bidding opens
Wednesday is the lot at 5460 Transit Road at Terrace Boulevard in Depew owned by
Transit Auto Center, also known as Jim Mazz Auto.

The owner, James R. Mazzariello, and others at the company remain under federal
grand jury indictment in connection with an alleged bribery scheme involving
Buffalo police officers in exchange for receiving towing jobs in the city. A
former manager at Mazz Auto, Christopher Mahoney, confessed to federal
authorities that he was involved in the scheme between 2009 and 2012.

County records show taxes were last paid by the auto dealership in 2011. Since
then, more than $60,000 in tax liens have accrued, tax records show. The Transit
Road parcel being foreclosed upon is assessed at $300,000.

Among other properties on the auction list are:

· A 0.15-acre parcel at 4584 Lake Shore Road in Hamburg. A house on the site was
demolished in 2001, according to records. More than $103,000 in liens on the
property have accrued dating back to 2003, according to county tax records.

· A structure on a 0.75-acre parcel at 2076 Langford Road in North Collins
that's listed to William R. Dils Sr. Post 199, Veterans of Foreign Wars. The
property has been in delinquency, county tax records show, since 2000 with more
than $14,500 in total tax liens reported.

· A 2½-acre site at 620 Orchard Park Road in West Seneca, which carried the
biggest tax lien on the list, $477,002, as of the Sept. 2 filing date; it has
since risen to $568,206. The property is listed as an automobile dealership
whose last known owner is Perry M. Duronio, according to county records, and is
assessed at $341,000. An Internet search shows the property as a car repair shop
under the name "Walden Automotive Center" and gets an "F" rating from the Better
Business Bureau.

The Tax Department said that opening bids for properties will be announced
Wednesday "as each parcel is brought to the floor" and noted that a parcel's
listed tax lien might not necessarily correspond to that opening bid.

Doors to Mason O. Damon Auditorium at the library will open at 8:30 a.m.
Wednesday, an hour prior to the start of the auction. Advance registration is
required. It can be done online at http://www2.erie.gov/ecrpts/.

Foreclosure Starts, Housing Affordability Increase in January

BYLINE: Jacob Passy

SECTION: SERVICING; Pg. 10 Vol. 39 No. 21

LENGTH: 385  words


Despite an increase in housing affordability, both first-time and repeat
foreclosure starts reached 12-month highs in January, according to Black Knight
Financial Services.

Repeat foreclosure starts were up 11% from December and comprised 51% of all
starts, while first-time foreclosure starts rose slightly by less than 1% to a
yearly high, Black Knight said in its latest Mortgage Monitor Report.

Housing affordability, meanwhile, also increased due to the continued low
interest rate environment.

For foreclosures, a divide was seen between judicial and nonjudicial states. The
former saw January starts jump 10% from December, while nonjudicial states only
increased 1.7%. Judicial states also saw higher levels of new problem loans and
loans 90 or more days delinquent.

"At the same time, foreclosure sale counts - essentially, completed foreclosures
- have been decreasing more rapidly than the inventory of seriously delinquent
loans in both judicial and nonjudicial states," said Trey Barnes, Black Knight's
senior vice president of loan data products, in a press release accompanying the
report.

"As a result, foreclosure pipeline ratios, the backlog in months of foreclosure
and 90-day delinquent inventory based on current foreclosure sale rates, have
been increasing across the board."

In judicial states, the pipeline ratio was at 58 months, and nonjudicial states
are not too far behind at 53 months.

On a more positive note, Black Knight also reported a 1.41% decrease
month-to-month in the total U.S. loan delinquency rate, which now stands at
5.56%. Additionally, the five states with the highest percentage of noncurrent
loans were Mississippi, New Jersey, Louisiana, New York and Maine.

Housing affordability, measured as a ratio of fixed-rate mortgage payment on the
median home price to the median monthly household income, stood at 21% - well
above the low of 17.6% in October 2012 but still off the July 2006 high of
34.7%. The report added that home prices could increase 25% or interest rates
could jump 2% before affordability returned to its pre-recession levels.

In terms of the least affordable housing markets, Washington, D.C., Hawaii and
California came out on bottom having become less affordable than before the
housing bubble, while another seven states are on the cusp of a similar shift.

Can private firms collect back taxes?;
Pa.'s Supreme Court has been asked to hear the
issue, which stems from an Allegheny County suit.<

BYLINE: Thomas Fitzgerald INQUIRER HARRISBURG BUREAU

SECTION: PHILADELPHIA; Pg. B07

LENGTH: 791 words

DATELINE: HARRISBURG


The Pennsylvania Supreme Court was asked yesterday to decide whether private
companies can collect delinquent taxes for governments and, if so, whether they
have the power to tack on penalties and fees.

In a case brought by two delinquent Allegheny County taxpayers, Commonwealth
Court ruled in July that GLS Capital Inc. had satisfied all the taxpayers' debts
when it paid the county $50 million for a portfolio of property-tax liens in
1997 and 1998.

Allegheny County, the company, and other municipal governments, including the
City of Philadelphia, joined in an appeal to ask the Supreme Court to hear the
issue on an emergency basis.

The taxpayers' challenge threatens the widespread practice of local governments
selling off blocks of hard-to-collect tax liens. Governments get an infusion of
cash, while the companies get to keep whatever they collect from delinquent
taxpayers, plus interest and fees. They also can foreclose on those who refuse
to pay.

Philadelphia sold off to private firms $106 million worth of tax liens in 1997
under former Mayor Edward G. Rendell, issuing $75 million in bonds against the
debt in order to get an immediate infusion of cash for the city schools. So far,
collections have lagged and the city faces a potential financial hit when the
bonds come due in 2004.

Justices heard oral arguments in the Allegheny County case yesterday. It was not
known when they would issue an opinion.

The appellants argue that the 6-1 Commonwealth Court decision, written by Judge
Dan Pellegrini, goes against well-established contract law, a Commonwealth Court
decision from 1999 that appeared to allow the practice, and the Municipal Claims
Act of 1923, which authorizes governments and assignees to collect delinquent
taxes and fees.

"Think of the practical effect," George Janocsko, the assistant Allegheny County
solicitor, urged the justices yesterday. "It's hard enough to get people to pay
their taxes. I don't think the legislature ever intended to create more
confusion in the collection of taxes."

Depending on how it is read, the Commonwealth Court decision finds that private
companies do not have the power to assess collection fees and interest, and may
not have the power to collect delinquent taxes.

"When GLS bought the liens and paid the county, the underlying delinquent tax
was satisfied," Pellegrini wrote in the decision. The taxpayers would still, in
theory, owe GLS the amount of the original bill for back taxes, but not the fees
added on by the company.

Without the ability of private collectors to assess attorneys' fees and
penalties, governments would not be able to get anyone to buy liens - closing
off a valuable financial tool, Janocsko said.

Attorneys for two small businesses in Allegheny County - Pentlong Corp. and
Weitzel Inc. - argue that two laws passed by the legislature in 1933 and 1936,
explicitly say that only county treasurers can collect penalties and attorney
fees on delinquent-tax debt. It also said that only government can impose
interest, capped at 6 percent, later raised to 12 percent in a 1982 amendment.

Ironically, the legislature passed those Depression-era laws to curb abuses by
private delinquent-tax collectors in Allegheny County. "This is just history
repeating itself," said Bernard Rubb, the attorney for the taxpayers.

Rubb's firm is seeking to make its case a class-action one on behalf of more
than 40,000 delinquent taxpayers in the county. He said that GLS had levied
exorbitant fees on people, citing a $237 tax delinquency on a home in the
Borough of Homestead that swelled to $2,760 after fees were added.

"This was a quick fix, not well thought through by the county," Rubb said.
"Government doesn't exist to allow people to be taken advantage of."

When it made its deal with GLS, Allegheny County was facing a gaping budget
deficit after a $20 million tax cut pushed through by a new Republican majority
on the county commission. Although the company has joined the county in the
case, it also has filed formal notice to sue for return of its money if they
lose in the Supreme Court.

The agreement the county signed with GLS stipulated that individual taxpayers'
debts would remain open until the company was paid, Janocsko said.

"Our intention was that the very lucrative payment to Allegheny County did not
extinguish the debt," he said.

"What does your intent have to do with the law?" asked Justice Ralph J. Cappy.

On the other hand, Cappy and other justices were equally skeptical of the other
side. If the Commonwealth Court ruling stands, "the windfall goes to the
delinquent taxpayer," Cappy said.

Eau Claire, Dunn county tax delinquencies up

BYLINE: Andrew Dowd, The Leader-Telegram, Eau Claire, Wis.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 679 words


Mar. 14--More property owners in Eau Claire and Dunn counties are having
problems paying their property taxes this year.

Tax delinquencies -- those who didn't pay at least the first half of their 2008
property tax bill by Jan. 31 -- jumped by 35 percent in Dunn County, about
$790,000 more than the $2.28 million reported last year.

Eau Claire County's increase came to about 5 percent, about $200,000 higher than
the $4.3 million in delinquent 2007 tax bills.

While the $200,000 is significant, Eau Claire County Treasurer Larry Lokken said
it is lower than the increase between 2006 and 2007. Delinquent taxes increased
by $600,000 that year.

Delinquent notices were sent in recent weeks to Dunn and Chippewa County
residents, but not to Eau Claire County residents.

Eau Claire County once sent overdue tax notices in spring, summer and fall,
Lokken said, but the budget for postage and forms was trimmed about five years
ago. Now only one notice is sent -- in August.

Dunn County mailed about 1,200 notices, county Treasurer Mary Erpenbach said.

Delinquent taxes dropped in Chippewa County.

"I actually have less delinquent in '08 than '07," said Patricia Schimmel,
Chippewa County treasurer.

Delinquencies fell by about 2 percent -- $48,000 -- for taxes collected by
February compared with the same time last year. However, she noted there was a
$660,000 increase in delinquencies between 2006 and 2007.

"The huge jump was between 2006 and '07," she said. "I was expecting '08 to be
worse."

While Chippewa County's delinquent 2008 taxes were down from 2007, Schimmel said
more delinquent notices were sent out because people still had unpaid bills from
previous years. In February 2,548 notices were sent for parcels with past-due
taxes; that compares with 2,266 last year.

In addition to unpaid taxes from the first 2009 deadline, Schimmel said Chippewa
County still has about $1.5 million in back taxes from previous years.

In addition to taxes that went delinquent for Eau Claire County residents in
February, about $1.3 million also is overdue from previous years, Lokken said.

All the local treasurers recommend that people pay their taxes in installments
if they can't pay the entire amount or if they can't pay half in January and
half in July.

"We encourage them to pay what they can by that due date so only the unpaid
balance goes delinquent," Schimmel said.

One percent interest is charged at the beginning of each month on overdue taxes;
counties also can impose up to a half-percent penalty.

Chippewa County doesn't charge a penalty, but Dunn County decided to increase
its penalty from one-fourth percent to the maximum. Eau Claire has charged the
maximum half-percent penalty since 1982.

The interest is cumulative, meaning that 1.5 percent would be charged on
past-due taxes in February, but that would go up to 3 percent in March for Eau
Claire and Dunn counties. Waiting the whole year to pay any property taxes will
result in 18 percent interest and penalties, Erpenbach said.

"The moral of the story is pay your taxes on time," she said.

Because the interest isn't added until the first of each month, Erpenbach
advises cash-strapped taxpayers to pay whatever they can by the end of each
month to reduce the back taxes' accumulating interest.

And Lokken said it appears as if more people are paying their taxes in
installments instead of two halves.

He and the other treasurers also said there is no real minimum payment for
people who pay their taxes in installments.

"I don't care if they come in here every week to make a payment," Lokken said.
"We will accept anything."

Housing spin-off on late tax list;
Durham agency disputing tax assessment; county identifies top delinquents

BYLINE: BEN EVANS bevans@heraldsun.com; 419-6600

SECTION: DURHAM; Pg. B1

LENGTH: 1147  words


A spin-off company started by the Durham Housing Authority is among the top
delinquent taxpayers from 2003, according to a list published recently by the
Durham County tax office in an effort to improve collections.

Fayette Place LLC, a corporation formed by DHA to renovate an old public housing
project into affordable apartments, owes $129,272.78, according to the tax
office.

Frank Meachem, DHA's interim executive director, said the authority is disputing
the tax assessment on the property.

The delinquent list also includes a number of familiar names: former Durham
Mayor Chester Jenkins, landlords Ronnie Sturdivant and Bill Fields, Hayti
Development Corp. and a company run by Denise and Larry Hester that owns the
Phoenix Crossing Shopping Center.

Several large corporations top the list.

At No. 1 is a company called State Street Bank & Trust of Boston, owing
$728,604.08. But a company official said that bank has sold its trust division
to a company called U.S. Bancorp. Amy Frantti, a spokeswoman at U.S. Bancorp,
couldn't immediately explain why the taxes hadn't been paid, but said the bank
didn't own the property in question, and merely acted as a trustee for the
investors. The property appears to be several parcels in and around Research
Triangle Park.

After the No. 2 Fayette Place, a building company called Habitech Enterprises of
Cary ranks third, owing $80,664 on more than 30 properties listed as being in
the Arbors at Treyburn. Mehdi Dehghan, who is listed as the corporate agent for
the company at the N.C. Secretary of State's office, could not be reached for
comment.

Other top debtors include a company listed as ZSF/Land Parcels LLC, which owes
$61,593.45, and a California-based electronics manufacturer called Solectron
Global Services, which owes $48,136.31. Solectron recently bought the property
in question from IBM, and a spokesman said the taxes must have been delayed as a
result of the sale.

"It's just a clerical error basically," said spokesman Derek Handova. "I can
tell you that $48,000 is a lot of money to any one person, but to Solectron as a
corporation, basically it's a rounding error."

'Crazy' assessment

For the Fayette Place project, the housing authority is converting the former
200-unit Fayetteville Street public housing community into 168 apartments, at a
cost of about $14 million. To do the project, the authority created a private
limited liability corporation called Fayette Place LLC to get tax credits.

According to county records, the Fayette Place property, which includes three
parcels, is assessed for tax purposes at $9.9 million, an amount that housing
authority officials say is ridiculous.

"The assessment is just wild. It's crazy," said Mary McCallister, a former DHA
executive who helped organize the project. "What it's assessed for isn't
anything near its appraisal."

The DHA has appealed the assessment for the 2004 tax year, but tax officials say
the DHA missed the January 2003 deadline for appealing that year's assessment.
Therefore, the 2003 tax is no longer open to appeal and the $129,272.78 is past
due and is already collecting interest penalties.

"We're going to have to do what we have to do," Meachem said. "It might put a
strain on us, but ... it's something that we have to do."

He said he thought Fayette Place LLC "probably" had enough money in its budget
to cover the bill, and that "we don't think we have to dip into the housing
authority funds at this time."

The housing authority operates independently of the city, although its board is
appointed by the City Council, and receives most of its funding from the federal
government.

Another community development organization, Hayti Development Corp., is on the
list for at least the second straight year, owing $4,804.36 on seven properties.
Bridgette Raspberry, who recently served as executive director of the
organization, has not returned repeated phone calls, and it's not clear whether
the organization is still operating.

The organization has received hundreds of thousands of dollars in city funding
over the past couple of decades, but the City Council halted that funding last
year amid concerns over its lack of production, and after records showed that it
was mired in debt and behind in paying its taxes. A production company that
created an acclaimed documentary film on gangs in Durham appears to be using
space in Hayti's offices on East Main Street, but Hayti's business phone number
has been disconnected.

Jenkins' discrepancy

Former Mayor Chester Jenkins, who has been cited in the past for maintaining
substandard rental housing, was listed as owing $2,544.59 on five properties.

After serving as mayor from 1989 to 1991, Jenkins was hired in 1994 as director
of the city's Human Relations Department before he resigned in 2000 over
concerns about his rental housing and over lax financial management at the
department.

On Friday afternoon, Jenkins said he had paid his taxes about two or three weeks
ago, and that one of the properties in question -- at 2607 Fayetteville St. --
was sold in April 2003, so he shouldn't owe anything on it.

Gene Hodges, the county's collection division manager, confirmed that Jenkins
had paid most of his taxes in early March, but according to both Hodges and
county tax records, Jenkins still owed $892.91 on the property at 2607
Fayetteville St.

Hodges said county records listed Jenkins as the owner of the 2607 Fayetteville
St. property, while Ray Tinnika, the man to whom Jenkins said he sold that
property, was listed as the owner of another property at 2318 Fayetteville St.

When told about the discrepancy Friday afternoon, Jenkins said he would check
with the tax office to make sure the information got straightened out.

Bill Fields, a real estate investor who owns a number of properties on Ninth
Street and elsewhere around downtown, is listed as owing $20,912.74 on 13
properties. Fields, who acknowledged that he was often late paying his taxes,
said he thought the taxes were too high, but that "we always come through and
pay it."

"Some of these properties sit and don't make any money," he said. "We all put
our priorities in certain places. Like anybody, we try to pull our fair share
... but I do think it's a little excessive. We're carrying a lot of people who
aren't paying their fair share."

Zuri and Associates, which built the Phoenix Crossing Shopping Center in part
with a $500,000 taxpayer loan, is listed as owing $30,962.29 on the Fayetteville
Street center. Partner Larry Hester said he already had paid half of the bill
and had set up a payment plan, which tax officials confirmed, to pay the
remainder next month.

Sturdivant, who has been late in past years and has clashed with the city before
over uses of his Temporary Quarters hotel on Chapel Hill Street near the Durham
Police Headquarters, owes $5,765.35 on the property. Asked about the taxes by
telephone, he hung up.

Caretaker doesn't want to register for overnight visits

BYLINE: RICHARD WHITE; Tribune correspondent

SECTION: BAYLIFE AND TRAVEL; Baylife; Pg. 7

LENGTH: 1177 words



HIGHLIGHT: Rules of the Roost


Q: I am a caretaker of a friend who lives in a condominium. This is considered
an adult community. Since I sometimes stay overnight when my friend is ill, the
board has asked me to register as an occupant. Why should I register, since I do
not live here nor I am an owner?

G.H., St. Petersburg

Answer: All associations and condominiums have different rules and regulations
as well as different documents. There could be any number of reasons why an
association or condominium asks visitors or new residents to register. Maybe
they have a rigid security program, maybe they have concerns that an underage
person will be residing in the unit and affect their adult community status.
Maybe they have a strict screening policy and need to review all residents who
live in the community. The root of their registration program should be found in
the documents and maybe past negative experiences. I would suggest that you have
the owner contact the board and find out what you need to do. She can also find
out why the board is taking the action that requires you to register.

Q: Should the HOA disclose at the annual meeting which residents are behind on
HOA dues? Some units are as far as 18 to 24 months behind.

T.S., Miami

Answer: I do not recommend that a dunning list with names be published. It would
be correct to report that x number of units are delinquent, but not by name.

You have a larger problem if the board is not taking aggressive collection
actions. No home should be more than 60 days delinquent without having the
attorney file a lien. If the lien is not satisfied within 30 to 60 days, the
attorney should be instructed to start foreclosure. In other words, your board
is failing to protect the other owners by compelling delinquent owners by legal
force. Your association board has the most powerful tool to compel delinquent
owners to become current. They can take title to the home and force the owners
onto the street.

Q: I live in a gated community HOA. We have homes here that are bank owned and
others that are in foreclosure. Almost all of these homes need to have the
roofs, sidewalks and driveways cleaned. They also are in arrears with their HOA
fees; some are quite substantially behind. According to our lawyers, we cannot
go in and clean them, because we would be trespassing on private property. We
are told that we can fine them according to our HOA rules, but only up to
$1,000. We still cannot get the banks who own these homes to pay these
maintenance fees and pay to clean up the homes. I am of the understanding that
if the bank owns the property, they are responsible for maintaining the homes
and paying the quarterly fees. Is there anything our HOA can do resolve this
problem, or are we stuck with waiting for when the home finally does sell, and
hope that we get our money, etc.? I would think that anyone who owns these homes
would keep the appearance of these homes in good condition to help sell them.

D.C., Port St. Lucie

Answer: Try to make direct contact or send certified letters to advise the bank
of the conditions of the homes. If they are behind in the maintenance fees,
include that in the letters. Just because the bank owns the homes, that doesn't
exclude them from collections. You have the right to lien and foreclose on
bank-owned homes. As for the clean-up or maintenance of these homes, read your
documents to see whether the association has a right to enter on the property to
make repairs. Then ask your attorney about self-help. That is a legal term that
would allow the association to enter on private property with certain rights.

As to the homes under foreclosure, that is a little more involved. Again a
letter to the bank may solve the problem.

From your letter, it appears that you are not receiving sound legal advice.
Maybe it is time to look for a new attorney who knows association law. Your
attorney was correct in one thing; you cannot just enter into private property
without the owner's authorization, but you can use self-help if you have the
rights.

Q: We have lived in a penthouse condominium for many years.  The building, which
is poured concrete, is approximately 35 years old.  The roofs and top floor
decks are flat with no sloping.  We have endured constant leaks for the entire
time we have been living here. The board has had numerous contractors work to
resolve these leaks, but nothing has worked 100 percent.

Now the building is going through major construction to fix concrete crack
damage, roof leaks etc.  I do not feel confident that this latest venture will
completely stop our leaks. Our assessment will be due shortly, and I would like
to hold back payment until I am confident that there are no more leaks. Can I
legally hold back payment until I am satisfied with the work?

A.C., Plantation Key

Answer: The short answer is NO! You have no right to withhold your fees unless
you have a court order. The payments of your fees and the repairs you need have
no relation with each other.

I am surprised the engineers have not found a solution. In my experience, I have
seen two solutions to the same problem. One was to install a new floating
tapered deck. The other was to use a coating that was applied to be thicker at
the top and thinner at the footing. However, neither of these would work with
blowing rain.

Living on the top floor, it would be my guess you only have water penetration
from the wind and not normal rain. Maybe you need to have a door person inspect
the doors and windows to make sure the seals are properly working or that the
ventilation systems are resealed.

Q: I read somewhere that if the board uses the reserves for anything but what
they were allocated for, it is a felony crime. I don't know who to go to for
help. Our local police will not help; they are too busy with identity fraud. Can
you help me?

G.S., Hallandale

Answer: Unless the directors use the funds for their personal use, it should not
be considered a crime. It would be considered an improper use of funds. Reserve
accounts are the property of the owners and can only be used for the line item
for which they were collected. Unless the members vote to move or transfer the
reserve funds, the board should not use the funds.

You have several courses of action that you can take. You can write the board a
letter and ask them to replace the funds and discuss the matter at the next
board meeting. You can report the matter to the state division, but you need
proof of the improper use of the reserves and you will need to put your
complaint in writing and sign it. Another course of action is to recall the
board. If you take this action, I suggest you engage an attorney to help follow
the statutes. The most obvious course of action is to elect a new board of
directors at the next annual meeting.

CITY COUNCIL FOUR-INSTALLMENT TAX PLAN OK'D

BYLINE: JEFF GLAZE

SECTION: LOCAL; Pg. A5

LENGTH: 481 words


Taxpayers will be able to pay their property taxes in four installments after an
ordinance change adopted Tuesday by the Madison City Council.

The change from two installments is intended to help prevent people from
reaching delinquent status with their taxes, but Dane County officials protested
the change, citing a small number of delinquent taxpayers and a loss in revenue
for the county.

"It doesn't seem like this is addressing as big of an issue as people think it
is. We're talking approximately 200 households," said Dane County 8th District
Superintendent Carousel Andrea Bayrd. "In the past 10 years from 2001 to 2011
there were under 100 delinquencies in Madison and more than 50 percent of those
are businesses."

This change sets dates for which each payment will become delinquent. It also
shifts collection of interest and penalties on most delinquent taxes from the
county to the city during the first six months of delinquency, increasing
revenue for the city by $200,000 or more per year. The county estimated the
amount to be between $200,000 and $400,000.

The council agreed to take action at a future meeting to find a way to return
the money to the county.

Many people pay their property taxes in full before the end of the year for a
tax deduction benefit, but for those struggling to pay high amounts, City
Treasurer Dave Gawenda said spreading out payments can be beneficial.

"Municipalities with three or four installments see significant drops in
delinquencies. The reason is because the first payment is smaller," he said.

Ald. Mark Clear, 19th District, sponsored the change and said it was meant to
help people manage their cash flow.

"It pains to hear Superintendent Bayrd say you're doing this to the county.
â[#x20ac]¦ We are not doing this to the county. We're doing this for our
citizens," he said.

Also on Tuesday:

* The council rejected 9-9 an amendment to the city's adopted 2013 operating
budget to provide $50,000 for youth employment initiatives based on police
savings from the Mifflin Street Block Party.

Mayor Paul Soglin had said if police costs for the event came in under budget,
he would allocate the remaining funds for youth programs, but numerous council
members disputed that he could make that promise alone and questioned the
process that would be used to allocate the money. Soglin was not at from
Tuesday's meeting.

* Council members unanimously approved an ordinance change to standardize
sidewalk cafÃ© closing times throughout the city. The change extends times for
serving and consuming alcohol at cafes on State Street and adjacent streets to
match the 1 a.m. shutoff for other parts of the city - unless an earlier time is
set on the liquor license.

The ordinance change also allows patrons to remain at all cafes citywide until
an establishment closes and allows the establishments to leave equipment on the
sidewalk for 30 minutes after it closes.

Tax sales 101: Winners and losers;
Some find big investment returns, others lose property and bounty hunters try to
profit

BYLINE: By CHRIS GAUTZ, Tribune Staff Writer

SECTION: LOCAL; Pg. B1

LENGTH: 602 words


PLYMOUTH -- Marshall County Treasurer Penny Lukenbill loves her job.

But one day each fall, she grudgingly goes along with the money and property
changing hands upstairs from her office.

"It's probably the least fun part of my job," she said.

In late September or early October each year, companies, investors and people
trying to save their home or business head to the third floor of the Marshall
County Building for the annual tax sale.

For a property to be eligible for tax sale, the owner must have delinquent taxes
due from the previous spring installment.

This year, the spring installment was due May 23, and Lukenbill's office will
then have until July 1 to certify any delinquencies.

For those who did not pay on time this year, and still have delinquent payments
from the last two collection dates, their properties will become eligible to be
sold at the tax sale this fall.

Most either pay what they owe or work out some arrangement when they receive the
letter about the possibility of losing their property, she said.

Ordinarily about 1,300 properties are eligible, and by the day of sale, only
about 100 are, Lukenbill said.

Lukenbill said property owners have until before July 1 to pay the oldest
delinquency to keep out of a tax sale.

After July 1, they have to pay everything that is delinquent before the tax sale
to keep it from being possibly sold.

"After that time, my hands are tied," Lukenbill said.

She also said she is always willing to work out a payment plan with minimum
payments of $50, sent in weekly or monthly.

"I will always work with folks," she said.

When notices were sent out in November 2005, Marshall County was owed $2.3
million in delinquent taxes.

By March of this year, Lukenbill had received $1.5 million.

"There are a lot of folks who are always playing catch-up," she said.

For those who can't or decide not to pay their back taxes, the tax sale process
begins.

Once the eligible properties are identified, the owners are notified and a list
of properties becomes available in the auditor's office. It is also available,
and updated regularly, on the Web site of the company that performs the tax sale
for the county, SRI Inc.

SRI, based in Indianapolis, conducts the tax sales in 77 of the state's 92
counties, President Jim Hughes said.

Investors from around the state who come to tax sales are looking to make a
profit and aren't interested in obtaining the property they are buying the lien
on, Hughes said.

When someone wants to buy a property, they often search through and find homes
or businesses they think the owner will most likely buy back.

The original owner of a property bought at a tax sale has a year to buy it back.

If they do, the buyer at the tax sale receives back what they paid for it from
the county, which holds the money, and another 10 percent from the original
owner.

If the original owner does not buy it back, the buyer at the tax sale gets to
keep the property.

The original owner, who has now lost the property, is entitled to the surplus,
which is the difference between the back taxes and what the tax sale buyer
purchased it for.

There are those who are aware of the collectible money, though, Lukenbill said.
She calls them "bounty hunters."

They determine who is owed this surplus money, contact them and offer to get
them the money, but charge them a sometimes 30 percent to 40 percent finders
fee, depending on the amount of the surplus.

Lukenbill said the "service" the bounty hunters provide is unnecessary, because
all the original owner has to do is call her and she will give them their money.

Tax delinquents nearing deadline

BYLINE: Hillary Chabot

SECTION: LOCAL/REGIONAL

LENGTH: 389 words

DATELINE: LEOMINSTER


City officials have given delinquent taxpayers a deadline to cough up money owed
to the city -- or they'll place a lien on their property, said Treasurer David
Laplante.

Owners of the former restaurant EJ Marrone's top the list of roughly 100 overdue
taxpayers owing at least $8,000, Laplante said.

"Ninety-nine percent of taxpayers pay. It's not fair to let the one percent
off," Laplante said. "Everybody has to pay their fair share or we'll go and take
their land."

The delinquent taxpayers have until Nov. 8 to pay their bill in full or city
officials will place a lien on their properties and could eventually start
foreclosure proceedings, Laplante said.

Edward J. Marrone, owner of the former restaurant which closed earlier this
year, could not be reached for comment.

The tax bills were published in the Sentinel & Enterprise on Oct. 19 as a final
warning before city officials place the liens, Laplante said. The amount
published does not include interest on the debt or additional charges property
owners might owe, Laplante said.

The warning was the last notice in a long process which begins after fiscal year
2004 closed on June 30, Laplante said.

The delinquent taxpayers with the highest bills include Edward J. Marrone who
owes $8,334; 444 Central Street, LLC. which owes $4,692; Flora B. Mainville who
owes $3,435; and Robert Bashaw who owes $3,403.

The property owners could not be reached for comment.

Laplante said if the bill isn't paid within six months after the lien is placed
the city can begin foreclosure proceedings.

"They either pay it or we get it," Laplante said.

Delinquent tax payers are originally sent two letters reminding them of their
debt and warning them about the impending lien, Laplante said. City officials
then publish the delinquent's names and debt in the paper with a deadline for
payment.

Laplante said the cost of advertising and any legal costs stemming from placing
a lien or foreclosing will be billed to the property owners.

"Whatever we spend is included in their bill," Laplante said.

Property owners will usually pay up if their land is about to be taken away,
Laplante said.

"Ninety percent of people who we are going to foreclose on pay up. They know
their property is worth a lot more than the taxes they owe," Laplante said.

More amnesty for delinquent taxes;
The county is owed $ 27 million for delinquent personal property tax and has
given businesses until February to pay up.

BYLINE: Sandra Eckstein

SECTION: SOUTH FULTON EXTRA; Pg. 08JK

LENGTH: 390 words


Although a recent amnesty for delinquent property taxpayers brought in much less
than expected, the county is extending a similar offer for those behind on
paying their personal property taxes.

Businesses in the county must pay taxes on items used to conduct business as
well as inventory. That includes airplanes, computers, furnishings and similar
"movable" items.

Fulton Tax Commissioner Arthur Ferdinand said about $ 27 million in outstanding
taxes is owed to the county for levied but unpaid personal property taxes, but
not all that is collectible.

"These taxes go back seven years, and some of these businesses have been gone
for five or six years," Ferdinand said.

He said his office is trying to purge its records of uncollectible taxes and
hopes the amnesty program will encourage existing businesses to pay up what they
owe.

The amnesty means Fulton County will waive the 10 percent penalty on delinquent
personal property accounts, although late-payers still will have to pay the
interest rate of 1 percent a month and a $ 10.50 fee per-year tax lien recording
fee. The 60-day amnesty ends Feb. 1.

A similar amnesty for property tax delinquents that ended Nov. 16 brought in
only about $ 3 million of the expected $ 25 million. The county had about $ 51
million in outstanding property taxes. Ferdinand said he did not want to predict
how much money the new offer, approved by commissioners last week, might bring.

"Last time I guessed I was so far off, I don't want to guess again," he said.

But Ferdinand said businesses might be willing to pay up right now since they
can take the payments as a tax deduction.

He also said once the files are purged of closed businesses, it will be easier
for his office to go after existing delinquent business owners, since they
usually have money on hand that can be seized.

"If they don't pay up, I will levy bank accounts, as I have been for some time,"
Ferdinand said.

The county is going to be especially aggressive in searching for funds now that
the projected 1999 budget has come up about $ 85 million short of revenues.
Commissioner Michael Hightower said programs like the amnesty give people a
chance to pay up with only minimal penalties and it benefits the county.

"We need to bring in all the revenue we can right now," Hightower said.

Trouble for '94-'95 Book of Business

BYLINE: BY LEW SICHELMAN

SECTION: Pg. 1

LENGTH: 477 words

DATELINE: Park City, UT


"Serious problems" already are showing up in the 1995 book of mortgage business,
another indication that the quality of loans isn't what it used to be.

Mortgages originated last year "haven't even matured yet, and they already are
starting to get into trouble," James Croft reported at the Midwinter conference
here last week.

Citing data from the Mortgage Information Corp., a San Francisco firm which
analyzes monthly payment information on 18,000 loans supplied by 25 major
lenders.  Mr. Croft, a specialist in loan quality, said the latest crop of
borrowers is "getting into trouble much earlier" than those in previous years.

Using "seriously delinquent loans" as its benchmark, MIC says that '95 vintage
mortgages are performing "six times worse" than '93 vintage loans after only 12
months of seasoning.

After two years of seasoning, moreover, 1994's book of business is three times
worse" than 1993's, according to MIC, which describes seriously delinquent loans
as those on which borrowers have missed three or more payments or are in
foreclosure.

MIC blames the higher delinquency rates in the last two years on the decline in
borrower quality plus the poorer quality of high loan-to-value mortgages.

Mr. Croft, who heads the Mortgage Asset Research Institute, Reston, VA, said
nonconforming loans are not performing as well as conforming mortgages, but they
are "not as bad" as those with high loan-to-value ratios.

Delinquencies among high LTV loans "are significantly above anything we've seen
for a long time," he said.

To make matters worse, according to MIC, there has been a marked increase in the
number of high LTV loans originated in recent years.

Last year, for example, 41% of all mortgages were for amounts above 80% of the
value of their underlying collateral.  In contract, only 20% of all mortgages
had LTVs over 80% two years earlier.

Moreover, the percentage of loans with LTVs greater than 90% increased from 7%
in 93 to 25% last year.

According to MIC, not every market is experiencing higher than usual delinquency
rates.

But there "are some rough spots," Mr. Croft said.

The worst market area in terms of seriously delinquent loans is Riverside, CA,
where 55 mortgages out of every 10,000 written last year are in trouble.  In
contrast, the national average is just 18 per 10,000.

Other trouble spots include Miami, where 46 per 10,000 loans are seriously
delinquent; Orlando, 41 per 10,000; Washington and Los Angeles, 40 each; Norfolk
and Baltimore, 38 each; Orange, NY, 30; Memphis, 29, and West Palm Beach, 27.

On the other hand, loans in Pittsburgh are performing far better than the
national average.  Only one every 10,000 loans is seriously delinquent in that
market.

Other top performing markets include Toledo, Monterey, Louisville, Tulsa, Grand
Rapids, Omaha, Kansas City, Buffalo and Honolulu.

Report: City blight enforcement lacking

BYLINE: Pat Kimbrough, The High Point Enterprise, N.C.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 826 words


Nov. 13--HIGH POINT -- A new report finds that High Point's housing blight
problems are due in part to "the absence of any real strategic and consistent
code enforcement program over the last decade."

The Center for Community Progress, a Washington, D.C., nonprofit that advises
local governments on how to deal with vacant and abandoned properties, reached
this conclusion after several months of studying the city's procedures for
dealing with the issue.

Tarik Abdelazim, associate director of national technical assistance for the
Center for Community Progress, presented the organization's final report to the
High Point City Council last week.

It selected High Point, Baltimore and Rockford, Illinois, to receive assistance
from a team of experts through a scholarship program.

The report pulls no punches when it comes to High Point's issues with blight.

"According to multiple city officials, including current City Council members,
prior councils would arbitrarily extend deadlines or repeatedly side with
'well-connected' property owners, in effect politicizing the enforcement of
housing code and rendering it ineffective," the report states.

Mayor Bill Bencini, who served on the council from 1999 to 2010, said in an
interview that past councils did sometimes grant requests from property owners
to delay demolitions or orders to repair, but it wasn't out of political
favoritism.

"I don't remember any overt or covert attempt to protect property owners,"
Bencini said. "What we did do occasionally, it just seemed like any excuse a
property owner had about enforcement took us forever. We would just give more
and more time."

Past councils sometimes granted owners extensions if there was evidence they
were trying to make improvements to their properties or if they claimed a
financial or health hardship.

"This current council has tried to wean itself of this bad habit," Bencini said.
"We've seen, recently, properties that have been under scrutiny for sometimes
five years or more, and (past councils) just kicked the can down the road. That
habit has changed. When it goes to five years, there's a pretty good chance that
property owner doesn't have intentions of doing anything."

He stressed that the current council has made code enforcement and blight
remediation a priority, budgeting more money to beef up staff and taking a more
aggressive approach with substandard properties.

Another issue flagged in the report is that the Guilford County Tax Department
doesn't start foreclosure proceedings on some houses in the city for non-payment
of property taxes until they are seven to eight years delinquent.

This "undermines the health and vitality of neighborhoods" and "invites
negligence and abuse by unscrupulous owners," the report states. "The social,
economic and fiscal costs of allowing tax delinquent properties to languish are
significant."

A total of 1,910 properties in the city are at least one year delinquent on
property taxes, owing a total of $4.87 million. The county has 426 High Point
properties in some stage of foreclosure, and the parcels are, on average, seven
years delinquent.

The city and county should establish a goal that, by 2019, all properties that
are two years delinquent will move forward with foreclosure, without exception,
the report states.

The report also flagged problems with the city's code enforcement system, which
involves the hiring of outside contractors to abate nuisances through measures
such as mowing high grass, removing trash and debris, boarding up vacant
structures or demolishing properties if the owner fails to make repairs.

The city recovered the costs of this abatement work in only 19 percent of the
cases from 2013 to 2015, paying contractors $275,700, with only $51,800 worth of
the liens paid to the city during this time frame.

Currently, there are nearly 1,700 unpaid code liens totalling $690,000 on 860
properties.

"All the liens you have issued, if they were ever to be contested, they probably
wouldn't stand up in court," Abdelazim told the council.

He said state law allows the city to undertake more proactive property
inspections and to require owners to actually repair their houses rather than
just "vacate and close," which is allowed under city ordinance.

"What do you think most people are going to choose? The property owners are
going to board up and wait to see what happens with the market," Abdelazim said.

The city has a chance to turn things around if it heeds the report's
recommendations, he said.

"Some areas I've been to that are more distressed than this, I have to look them
in the face and tell them it's going to be 30 years," Abdelazim told the
council. "I can honestly say, 10 to 15 years is a reasonable timeline for
turning around your neighborhoods."

Hundreds of firms getting comp debt notices

BYLINE: Paul J. Nyden

LENGTH: 370 words


pjnyden@wvgazette.com

The state's workers' compensation provider mailed notices this week to nearly
1,800 West Virginia employers, warning them they are delinquent in their
workers' comp premium payments.

If BrickStreet Mutual Insurance Co. does not receive those payments, the
employers will be declared in default. They then become personally liable for
any claims filed by injured employees, and may be fined or have their business
licenses revoked.

Only 43 of those 1,794 delinquent employers getting those letters owe $10,000 or
more. The vast majority of them owe $1,000 or less, and 732 employers owe $100
or less, including one Summersville woman whose business owes $16 after she made
payments of $25.

Last week, Insurance Commissioner Jane Cline, who now oversees BrickStreet, said
employers who were delinquent at the end of business on Feb. 24 would have their
policies with BrickStreet canceled.

The employers with the largest debts are:

-Tug Valley Mine Services of Williamson, owned by Jerry E. Russell, $196,744.

-Hillview Nursing, owned by Seventeenth Street Associates of Atlanta, $112,767.

-Young Insulation Group of St. Louis, $74,015.

-Global Industrial Projects of Letart, $64,606.

-Dana Transport of Avenel, N.J., $48,551.

-Autozoners Inc. of Memphis, Tenn. $37,895.

-Allied Security of King of Prussia, Pa., $37,2278.

-Rolling Frito Lay Sales, based in Plano, Texas, owes $37,228, while Frito Lay
Inc., based in Lincolnshire, Ill., owes another $5,363.

-Cedridge Connection, owned by Universal Cable Holdings in Tyler, Texas,
$36,779.

Some charitable organizations fell behind in making their payments.

The Salvation Army owes $24,859, while the Crippled Children's Home in Milton
owes $20,131.

The Wood County Senior Citizens Center, based in Parkersburg, owes $11,652.

Two companies that own Pizzeria Uno restaurants, based in Hurricane, together
owe $15,122.

A handful of the delinquent employers made some payments on their current bills
before last Friday's deadline. Nearly 1,100 employers made full payments shortly
before last Friday's deadline.

Employers who want to make arrangements to pay can call BrickStreet at 926-3470
or (866) 45-BRICK.

HB 525-FN - FISCAL NOTE

AN ACT raising the age of minority for juvenile delinquency proceedings from 17
to 18 years of age.

FISCAL IMPACT:

The Department of Health and Human Services states this bill, as introduced,
will increase state expenditures by $2,643,746 in FY 2014, and $5,287,493 in FY
2015 and each year thereafter. The Judicial Branch, states this bill may
increase expenditures by an indeterminable amount in FY 2014 and each year
thereafter. The Judicial Council, Department of Corrections, and New Hampshire
Association of Counties states this bill may decrease expenditures by an
indeterminable amount in FY 2014 and each year thereafter. There will be no
impact on county or local revenue or local expenditures.

METHODOLOGY:

The Department of Health and Human Services, Division for Children, Youth and
Families states this bill amends various sections of the RSAs 21-H, 169-B,
170-H, and 621 to raise the age of minority for juvenile delinquency proceedings
from 17 to 18 years of age. The Department assumes the cost to provide services,
placements, and programs to 17 year olds will be comparable to the cost of
providing services, placements, and programs to 16 year olds. The cost to
provide services, placements, and programs to 266 16 year olds in FY 2012 was
$5,287,493. Assuming that a comparable number of 17 year olds will enter, or
remain in the juvenile justice system as a result of this bill, and those 17
year olds will have similar service needs, the Department estimates this bill
will increase expenditures by $2,643,746, of which federal funds would total
$1,416,255 in FY 2014 (with an effective date of January 1, 2014), and increase
expenditures by $5,287,493, of which federal funds would total $2,832,510 in FY
2015 and each year thereafter. On average, the state/federal cost share for
these services, placements, and programs is 46.43% general funds and 51.48%
federal funds. Additional revenue to support these costs (2.09%) comes from the
"Children's Revolving Fund" account. While the increased number of youth
receiving services could result in the need for additional personnel resources,
the Department believes that it could manage the increased delinquency caseloads
with existing resources provided that the recent changes to the CHINS statute
and the corresponding reduction in caseloads remain in effect.

The Judicial Branch states the most recent data readily available for the number
of 17 year old offenders in District and Superior courts is from 2003. The
Branch states for purposes of this fiscal note, they assume case volume against
17 year olds has and will remain constant at the 2003 level. It is also assumed
that all of the criminal cases against 17 year olds, whether class B or class A
misdemeanors in the District Court or felonies in the Superior Court, would be
brought as juvenile cases under this bill. The Branch also assumes that each
criminal case results in one juvenile petition. Due to the fact that some
offenders will have more than one misdemeanor and/or felony charge, the number
of juvenile cases resulting from the proposed bill is indeterminable. The Branch
estimates increased costs for current cases in the District Court at $469,448,
and decreased costs for current cases in the Superior Court at $39,213, for a
net additional cost of $430,235. The impact in FY 2014 would be approximately
$215,118 due to an effective date of on January 1, 2014.

The Judicial Council states low-level criminal behavior and very serious
criminal behavior are likely to result in the same levels of expenditures as
experienced today for the indigent defense system. The Judicial Council states
with respect to felony-level criminal behavior, an indeterminate number of
felonies now brought as adult criminal cases would instead be brought as
juvenile delinquency matters. To the extent that this proposed statute might
increase the number of cases in which defendants will stand charged with
delinquencies and become eligible for appointed counsel at State expense, the
state would be subject to expenditures of approximately $275 for each
delinquency case handled by the public defender or contract attorney. If the
case were for some reason to go to assigned counsel, the cost would be $60 per
hour with a cap of $1,700. To the extent that this proposed statute might
decrease the number of cases in which defendants will stand charged with
felonies and become eligible for appointed counsel at state expense, the state
would be subject to fewer felony-level expenditures, which equal approximately
$756.25 for each "felony 2" case handled by a public defender or contract
attorney, and $2,282.50 for each "felony 1" case. If the case were for some
reason to go to assigned counsel, the cost would be $60 per hour with a cap of
$4,100. The Judicial Council states the costs associated with appeals and expert
services would be unchanged.

The Department of Corrections states the number of individuals who would be
affected by the change in the age of minority cannot be predicted. The
Department of Corrections states there is no impact for individuals found guilty
of a misdemeanor since the term of incarceration for a misdemeanor is one year
and sentences of one year or less are served in county correctional facilities.
The Department is not able to determine the impact of felony cases. The
Department of Corrections states the average annual cost of incarcerating an
individual in the general prison population for the fiscal year ending June 30,
2012 was $35,071. The cost to supervise an individual by the Department's
division of field services for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2012 was $608.

The New Hampshire Association of Counties states to the extent any 17 year old
individuals would have been incarcerated in the county correctional facility
prior to this proposed change, county expenditures will decrease. The average
annual statewide incarceration cost for inmates in county correctional
facilities is approximately $35,000. The Association is unable to determine the
actual decrease in expenditures.

The Department of Justice states it could absorb any costs resulting from this
bill without additional funds.

TAXATION AND REVENUE;
STATE APPEALS 2 OPEN RECORDS RULINGS

BYLINE: KATE NASH

SECTION: LOCAL NEWS; Pg. C-1

LENGTH: 679 words


In one case, department failed

to provide access to files 5 separate times

By Kate Nash

The New Mexican

The state Taxation and Revenue Department is appealing the recent awarding of
$25,970 in attorney's fees to the New Mexico Foundation for Open Government in
an open-records case.

The department is also appealing an order by state District Judge Valerie Huling
that, among other things, says records sought by private investigator Eric
Griego are public.

The department in its filing gave no reason for its appeal and declined comment
on the case Monday.

The case centers on requests by investigator Eric Griego, who is seeking access
to information managed by the department's Delinquent Property Tax Bureau,
including deeds and liens.

Griego in April 2006 sued the state, saying the department in 2002 had started
delaying or ignoring his requests for information relating to properties with
delinquent taxes. In 2005, he says, the department began denying his requests
for information -- the same information he had been obtaining since the early
1980s.

The state has said the information Griego is seeking isn't public. But Griego
disagrees.

"With the recent corruption cases in New Mexico, I'm surprised and disappointed
that the department has chosen to fight to keep these records managed by the
Delinquent Property Tax Bureau hidden and the people managing these funds
unaccountable," Griego said. "This decision should make everyone question
exactly why the Department wants to keep records out of the public eye."

Albuquerque attorney Pat Rogers worked with the Foundation for Open Government
in the case.

"It's unfortunate that the Tax and Revenue Department has decided to continue
its efforts to keep New Mexicans in the dark about these and other public
records, but it seems to be a trend," he said. "First it was the refusal to
disclose the driver's licenses of noncitizens, and now this. New Mexico is
supposed to be the 'sunshine state,' but the continued emphasis on secrecy does
not honor the First Amendment, good government or New Mexico's open records
laws."

As part of his work, Griego -- who is not the former Albuquerque city councilor
with the same name -- long has used the state's public-records law to obtain
property records such as deeds, liens and mortgage information.

Griego uses the information to recover money from the sale of properties with
delinquent taxes seized by the state for the heirs of former owners, for
example, who are entitled to the difference between the delinquent tax amount
and the amount the property sold for. The money otherwise would go to the state.

He also works to correct defects in property titles. He said none of the
documents he's seeking contain personal information such as Social Security
numbers or birth dates.

According to court documents, the Taxation and Revenue Department in at least
five cases didn't respond to Griego's record requests. State law requires
custodians of public documents to reply to a request for information within
three days and in most cases to provide the information within 15 days. In one
instance, Griego filed a request in July 2002 and didn't get a denial until
December 2005, court documents show.

As part of the case, Griego also is asking for his attorney's fees. In addition
to $64,241 in fees, he is seeking between $975,000 and $1.2 million in damages
for the withheld records. If awarded, the amount would mark the state's biggest
open-records case.

The lawsuit also in part prompted a review of the state's policy related to
people who locate owners of unclaimed property held by the state.

One part of Griego's lawsuit claims the department was improperly putting limits
on the number of records related to unclaimed property he could request at one
time.

Taxation and Revenue Department Secretary Rick Homans said the department will
now require "finders" to wait 48 months from the time the department gets
control of the property to start working claims.

AGGRESSION NOT JUST A 'BOY PROBLEM';
GIRLS IN MIDDLE SCHOOL ARE AS DELINQUENT AND AS ROUGH AS THEIR MALE PEERS, A NEW
STUDY SHOWS.

BYLINE: TIFFANY PAKKALA The Gainesville (Fla.) Sun

SECTION: FRONT; Pg. A1

LENGTH: 732 words

DATELINE: GAINESVILLE, FLA.


- Picture a group of middle-schoolers pushing each other and name-calling, and
what do you see?

If you envision a group of boys, you're only seeing half the picture, according
to a University of Florida researcher's finding that middle school girls are as
aggressive as their male classmates.

Delinquent and rough behavior once was considered a "boy problem," said Julie
Graber, an associate professor in the university's department of psychology.
"Some past studies didn't even include girls. But we found evidence --
unfortunately -- that girls are closing the behavioral gap."

In an analysis of more than 1,200 New York City middle school students, Graber
found that a larger proportion of seventh-grade girls -- 81 percent -- were
slapping and hitting people than boys -- 78 percent. And almost as many -- 78
percent of girls vs. 80 percent of boys -- were committing delinquent acts, such
as throwing objects at cars or shoplifting.

During the transition from sixth to seventh grade, girls in the study were more
likely than boys to exhibit increased feelings of anger. Graber said the finding
adds new depth to past analyses that showed increases only in depression and
sadness for adolescent girls.

The study also showed a reported decrease in self-control for both girls and
boys, which could explain why their age is marked as a typical starting point
for "problem behavior," Graber said.

She noted that the most severe delinquent acts were still more common among boys
than girls, and behavior such as gossiping was not included in her study.

The findings are part of a larger look at middle-schoolers that includes the
work of professors from Cornell and Columbia universities. They're trying to
uncover the reasons behind middle-schoolers' increased aggression and develop
intervention programs to target delinquency before it sets in.

Graber suggests the pressure of changing schools, the early onset of puberty and
peer pressure each could be factors in girls' aggression. She said training in
conflict resolution and defusing aggressive situations could help students learn
to handle the new emotions they feel during their middle school years.

"We certainly see aggressive behavior in middle school girls," said Jerry
Douglas, supervisor for student discipline in Alachua County, Fla. "Not
necessarily some of the more aggressive fighting, but the gossiping, the
note-writing. They seem to form alliances against particular girls."

At that age, girls are sometimes caught "slapping, pushing or manhandling boys.
It's their way of showing boys they like them," Douglas said.

Besides "discovering" boys, he added, girls are attending new schools, changing
classes, and "seeing things and hearing things they never heard before. There's
a humongous difference between sixth and seventh grade."

But the supervisor isn't ready to say male and female aggression is equal.

"In our society, it's more acceptable for girls to be in touch with their
feelings, and they act on them. Boys are more likely to keep it in and act like
it didn't bother them. Then it comes out in different ways," he said.

At Kanapaha Middle School in Gainesville, guidance counselor Kayla Huels spends
most of her day dealing with girls, who she said are more willing to talk to her
about their feelings than boys.

"But when it comes to discipline referrals or fighting, I'd say it's pretty
equal," she said.

At that age, students are inclined to become aggressive because "when seventh
grade hits, girls are interested in boys, and boys are interested in girls. But
they're still the babies of the school," she said. "I usually deal with
seventh-graders, and it's almost always about a boy."

On her way to give a lecture about bullying, Huels said such classes can help
smooth the transition. Schools also show a video to sixth-graders to help
prepare them for the changes ahead, and meet-and-greet programs are used to
better acclimate students with their new schools.

In one popular program entitled "peer mediation," schools directly target
conflicts with the help of students. Under the supervision of an adult, student
"mediators" talk out a student's issues and help come up with an acceptable
resolution.

"I think every school should have it," Huels said. "Sometimes kids relate better
to their peers than to adults."

Graber's full study will appear in an upcoming issue of the Journal of Applied
Developmental Psychology.

Phantoms and other tax matters

BYLINE: Tom Ferrick Jr.

SECTION: LOCAL NEWS PHILADELPHIA & ITS SUBURBS; Pg. B01

LENGTH: 677 words


Stick a shovel in the dirt in Philadelphia and you never know what you'll hit.
Sometimes you can even unearth some good news.

I've spent the last few days digging through records on delinquent taxpayers,
looking for big delinquents.

The data came courtesy of Ed Goppelt, the maestro of Hallwatch, the
indispensable Web site (www.hallwatch.org) crammed with information about city
government.

Goppelt, a computer whiz (one never calls a good source a geek), got raw data
from the Revenue Department and has been massaging it to extract information.

Want to find out if your neighbors are up-to-date in paying their property tax?
Go to Hallwatch and type in their names. If they owe, it will pop up.

Goppelt has also compiled a list of the largest tax delinquents.

The good news is that list has gotten much shorter since the last time I looked
at this kind of data, which was about a dozen years ago.

This is because the city has gotten better at pursuing the big delinquents,
mostly due to advances in computer technology.

When I covered City Hall in the early 1980s, if you wanted to know whether an
address was delinquent, you had to trek to the basement of the Municipal
Services Building and hand the address to a grumpy clerk at the Revenue
Department station, and he'd consult thick volumes before coughing up the
information.

Just a touch away

Today, all that data is computerized and available by hitting a button. Revenue
Commissioner Nancy Kammerdeiner told me that the city uses this capability to
"really go after high-dollar cases in a coordinated, comprehensive way."

The city uses a variety of weapons in going after tax deadbeats: liens on the
property, lawsuits, eventually sheriff's sales of the delinquent property.

One problem the city is trying to fix is "phantom delinquencies." These often
appear on properties seized or purchased by the city or one of its agencies,
such as the Redevelopment Authority.

The properties are later turned over or sold to developers or nonprofit groups
to be renovated or restored. When the city purchases them, all taxes owed are
supposed to be wiped out before they are transferred to another party.

That doesn't always happen. The delinquencies - they show up as property liens -
end up being carried over. A lot of the top delinquents turn out to be folks
with these phantoms.

Kammerdeiner said the city is trying to work out a way to make sure these liens
are purged, but it's not that simple. No one wants to give, say, a clerk in some
agency the power to obliterate tax liens with a keystroke. The Law Department,
the Redevelopment Authority and Revenue are huddling on the issue.

Movers and shakers

There are genuine tax delinquents out there, and they tend to be real-estate
speculators who buy properties and then don't pay the taxes until they are sold.

I also found a half-dozen big landlords who are part of the Section 8 program
run by the Philadelphia Housing Authority. Section 8 is the rental-voucher
program for the poor. There are about 16,000 units citywide.

But there's good news about this, too.

PHA spokesman Kirk Dorn said the agency recently started going after Section 8
landlords who owe back taxes.

The agency had a long-standing policy of not letting landlords with
delinquencies join the Section 8 program, but it did not actively monitor them
after they were in.

That's changed. The Citizens Advisory Committee, set up by PHA to monitor
Section 8, urged the agency to be more active in going after deadbeats. Chris
Artur, chair of the Section 8 advisory committee, told me that his group won PHA
approval to take advantage of the new computerized record-keeping.

"In the old days, if people bought properties and didn't pay taxes, it took the
city 10 years to catch up with them," Artur said. "Now, we've got the ability.
And we can tell these landlords, if they don't pay their taxes, they don't get a
check."

City rounding up late tax payments

BYLINE: Steve Vied, Messenger-Inquirer, Owensboro, Ky.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 369 words


Jan. 13--The city of Owensboro Finance Department personnel have been wearing
out the phones in January, tracking down residents who have not yet paid their
taxes on real and personal property and trying to get those bills paid.

The effort is working.

Angela Hamric, director of finance and support services, said on Thursday that
on Dec. 1, 2,092 real property tax bills were delinquent and 289 tangible
personal property tax bills were in arrears.

But after the Finance Department began calling, those numbers have dropped to
961 delinquent real property bills and only 70 tangible personal property bills
as of this week.

City property tax payments were due on Nov. 1, with a one-month grace period for
payment with no penalty. But if not paid before Dec. 1, delinquent bills became
subject to penalty and interest charges. The penalty is 10 percent. Interest is
0.5 percent a month.

"Any bills not paid by November are considered delinquent," Hamric said. "By
statute, the city must give a 30-day grace period before applying penalty and
interest."

Late payers received two late notices. "We send the initial tax bill in the
September-October time frame," Hamric said. "The second bill goes out
mid-December." That second bill serves as a late notice, she said.

The city mailed 22,736 real property tax bills last fall, and 2,045 tangible
personal tax bills. More than 90 percent were paid on time.

Since the late tax collection effort began, residents have paid $453,203 in
delinquent tax payments, Hamric said. But still uncollected is $147,023 in real
property taxes and a little more than $9,000 in personal taxes. she said..

The city depends heavily on real and personal property tax revenue. For the
2015-16 fiscal year that ended on June 30, 2016, the city collected more than
$10.3 million in property tax revenue, almost all of which went into the general
fund for general city expenses. Property tax revenue is second only to
occupational tax revenue in the city's revenue categories.

City rounds up late tax payments

BYLINE: Steve Vied, Messenger-Inquirer, Owensboro, Ky.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 368 words


Jan. 13--The city of Owensboro Finance Department personnel have been wearing
out the phones in January, tracking down residents who have not yet paid their
taxes on real and personal property and trying to get those bills paid.

The effort is working.

Angela Hamric, director of finance and support services, said on Thursday that
on Dec. 1, 2,092 real property tax bills were delinquent and 289 tangible
personal property tax bills were in arrears.

But after the Finance Department began calling, those numbers have dropped to
961 delinquent real property bills and only 70 tangible personal property bills
as of this week.

City property tax payments were due on Nov. 1, with a one-month grace period for
payment with no penalty. But if not paid before Dec. 1, delinquent bills became
subject to penalty and interest charges. The penalty is 10 percent. Interest is
0.5 percent a month.

"Any bills not paid by November are considered delinquent," Hamric said. "By
statute, the city must give a 30-day grace period before applying penalty and
interest."

Late payers received two late notices. "We send the initial tax bill in the
September-October time frame," Hamric said. "The second bill goes out
mid-December." That second bill serves as a late notice, she said.

The city mailed 22,736 real property tax bills last fall, and 2,045 tangible
personal tax bills. More than 90 percent were paid on time.

Since the late tax collection effort began, residents have paid $453,203 in
delinquent tax payments, Hamric said. But still uncollected is $147,023 in real
property taxes and a little more than $9,000 in personal taxes, she said.

The city depends heavily on real and personal property tax revenue. For the
2015-16 fiscal year that ended on June 30, 2016, the city collected more than
$10.3 million in property tax revenue, almost all of which went into the general

Berkeley history: Bad boys studied in 1934

BYLINE: By Steve Finacom Berkeley Historical Society

SECTION: MY TOWN; Western Contra Costa; Alameda; Contra Costa; News; Local

LENGTH: 636 words


SEVENTY FIVE years ago, the Nov. 19, 1934, Berkeley Daily Gazette carried a note
about the publication of a new book, "The Incidence of Delinquency in Berkeley,
1928-32."

It was just out from the UC Press, and a product of the Bureau of Public
Administration on the campus.

Your correspondent, in one of those rare coincidences that makes history a
pleasure to research, was able when he read that item to reach over to the
bookshelf and take down a copy of that very same book: a thin, blue-covered,
volume.

The authors studied records of nearly 2,000 juvenile (under 21 years old)
delinquents over a four-year period and put together an extensive analysis of
trends and behavior.

They even mapped where Berkeley's delinquents lived; all over the city,
essentially, with the most dense concentration seemingly running from north
central Berkeley south to the Oakland border. The ratio of delinquents to
population was highest in central Berkeley, immediately west and southwest of
the UC campus.

What sort of crimes had they committed and what problems did they cause?

The list was extensive, including "petty theft, truancy, sex offense other than
rape, larceny, larcenous mischief, burglary, disorderly conduct, drunkenness,
rape, automobile stealing, shoplifting, arson, forgery and theft, receiving
stolen goods, assault, purse snatching."

The numbers were inflated, however, by items we probably wouldn't consider
delinquency today including "health problems" and "suicide or attempted
suicide."

"Bad companions," as well as "Incorrigibility" and "Domestic difficulties" were
also included. Berkeley Police provided clarification of meanings, including
"quarreling with parents" as an example of "domestic difficulties."

"Bad companions" meant children "whose influence is unfavorable on some other
individual." And "sex offenses other than rape" included lewdness and exposure,
but also encouraging someone to "take part in any model artist exhibit... such
as is offensive to decency."

Petty theft was distinguished from grand theft, which included stealing a
"horse, mare, gelding, any bovine animal, mule, jack, jenny, sheep, lamb, hog,
sow, boar, gilt, barrow, or pig." Berkeley did have in that four-year period,
the statistics showed, one case of manslaughter and 18 cases of rape among those
under age 21.

Community Chest

Despite rainy weather, thousands of Berkeleyans came to Harmon Gymnasium on the
UC campus to see the first Berkeley Community Chest Exhibit.

Complete with musical entertainment, the exhibit showcased the needs and
programs of Berkeley's community service agencies.

Participating programs ranged from the Albany School Lunch Committee to the
YWCA, and included the Camp Fire Girls, Catholic Ladies Aid Society, Salvation
Army, and Berkeley Welfare Committee.

Thanksgiving

On Nov. 21, hundreds assembled for the 13th annual Berkeley Community
Thanksgiving Dinner, sponsored by the Chamber of Commerce. The event took place
at the Hotel Claremont.

That Saturday, unbeaten Stanford beat Cal 9-7 in the 40th annual Big Game played
at Stanford.

Pioneer passes

Mrs. Elizabeth Terry White, age 91, died in Berkeley on Saturday, Nov. 17. She
was a Berkeley "pioneer", having lived in the community most of her life, from
the 1860s on.

She attended the first graduation exercises at UC, and lived on a farm near
today's College and Ashby with her uncle and aunt, Mark and Elizabeth Ashby.

Stormy weather

A three-day storm blew across the Pacific Coast 75 years ago, dropping more than
an inch of rain in Berkeley, nearly stranding dignitaries in the high Sierra who
were attending the dedication of the Tahoe Ukiah Highway, and causing minor
flooding.

Three men drowned when their boat overturned in San Francisco Bay, but a boy
sailing with them was saved by a Berkeley dentist, out fishing, who rowed to his
rescue.

Many with altered loans again in trouble

BYLINE: Vikas Bajaj - The New York Times Media Group

SECTION: FINANCE; Pg. 15

LENGTH: 396 words

DATELINE: NEW YORK


Most troubled American homeowners whose mortgages were modified are again
falling behind on payments, a top U.S. banking regulator said, raising questions
about whether policy makers and lenders can successfully help them stay in their
homes.

Data from banks show that more than half of the loans modified during the first
three months of the year were delinquent by 30 days just six months after the
terms of the loans had been changed, John Dugan, the comptroller of the
currency, said at a conference in Washington on Monday. After eight months, 58
percent were delinquent again.

The rate at which borrowers fall behind on payments again - called the
re-default rate - appears to be much higher than what previous studies have
found. In October, a Credit Suisse study showed that about 30 percent of loans
modified at the end of last year were delinquent by 60 days within eight months
of the change.

Dugan said it was unclear why the re-default rates were so high after
modifications made by the 14 banks that provided data to his office. One
explanation might be that banks were not significantly changing the terms of the
loans they modified.

Analysts at Credit Suisse have found that modifications that do not lower
borrowers' monthly payments were more than twice as likely to become delinquent
again than changes that reduced payments. Banks like Chase, Citigroup and Bank
of America have only recently put more emphasis on lowering monthly payments.

Some loans may also be so poorly underwritten that no modification could help
the borrowers stay in homes that they can no longer afford, Dugan said. That
would confirm other studies that show homeowners who become delinquent are much
more likely to lose their homes today than in the past.

The Mortgage Bankers Association said last week that 30 percent of homeowners
who miss one payment end up in foreclosure a few months later. Historically,
only 12 percent to 15 percent fell that far behind and most borrowers were able
to catch up, sell their home or strike a better deal with their lender. In
California, however, 75 percent of homeowners who miss one payment end up in
foreclosure; in Florida, 65 percent who miss a payment do.

A sharp drop in home prices has made it much harder for homeowners to sell their
properties for as much as they owe, and rising unemployment is putting more
borrowers in financial distress.

Arcade owner owes $77K in taxes;
Property one of 12 Montgomery County delinquent properties

BYLINE: By Jim Bebbington jbebbington@DaytonDailyNews.com

SECTION: LOCAL; Pg. B1

LENGTH: 556 words


DAYTON - The new owner of the historic downtown Arcade is delinquent on more
than $77,000 in taxes on the property, which leads a list of the dozen most
delinquent Montgomery County properties.

The Arcade's owners, Brownfield Charities Inc., received the group of five
buildings that make up the Dayton landmark in a donation this year from an
entity controlled by area developer, Tom Danis. With the donation came the
overdue tax bill of $77,743.82.

Tony Staub, founder and trustee of Brownfield Charities, said Thursday he has no
money to pay the bill and is hoping for contributions or donations to help pay
it off.

"We're going into the winter months and I'm struggling to pay the heat costs,"
Staub said.

He said he has not had much interest from developers in renovating the buildings
and has no redevelopment plan of his own.

"Any time we talk about it, people say the situation downtown is so bad nobody
is going to invest $20 million," Staub said. "With the bus stops on Main and
Third streets, downtown is not good now. I'm looking for some good soul who can
help us pay these bills so we can move on. Right now we're struggling."

Staub started Brownfield Charities as a holding company to take donations of old
industrial buildings and redevelop them, putting any profits into charitable
work.

Dayton Mayor Rhine McLin said the Arcade is historic but the city cannot afford
to bail out Staub's group.

"It's going to come down to economic value versus sentimental value," McLin
said. "It's going to have to be citizens to step up to the plate and say whether
we want to save the Arcade or not."

Staub said the complex costs $200,000 a year for heat, security and taxes.

Montgomery County Treasurer Hugh Quill released his annual list of the top 12
delinquent properties Thursday.

He has done this every year since 1995 to try to bring pressure on delinquent
owners.

Of the 2003 dozen, one ended up in bankruptcy, three paid in full, six are in
foreclosure and two are on payment plans, Quill said.

Tax delinquent property owners can use a monthly payment plan to spread the
payments over 20 months.

Regarding the Arcade, Quill said: "The biggest concern we have is that taxes
that are in arrears are an indicator of an inability to fund basic operating
costs as well. We hope this is a rallying cry to the community to get this into
the hands of someone who can preserve this going forward."

The other 11 properties and their delinquencies are:

* 33 S. Main St., Dayton, the vacant McCrory store, owned by Kuhn Building Inc.,
$42,280.93.

* 2400 East River Road, Moraine, owned by HGCPC Inc., $40,151.51.

* 10561 Success Lane, Washington Twp., owned by Sportstown Ice Center Ltd.,
$39,859.09.

* 2300-2306 Valley Pike, Riverside, owned by GS Holdings-Laws Ltd., $34,112.62.

* 830 Scholz Drive, Vandalia, owned by Jay D. Blair and Daniel DeCarlo,
$32,237.86.

* 4066 Salem Ave., Trotwood, owned by Salem Capital Group, $27,998.70.

* 213 N. Beckel St., Dayton, owned by Dayton Paint and Coatings Inc.,
$27,048.18.

* 6971 Brookville-Salem Road, Brookville, owned by Western Ohio Properties LLC,
$25,872.02.

* A property on Taylorsville Road, Huber Heights, owned by Grove Park Office
Complex Inc., $25,283.01.

* 524-526 W. Norman Ave., Dayton, owned by Steven E. Stiger, $25,018.79.

* 1217 Salem Ave., Dayton, owned by Salem Professional Center Inc., $23,508.53.

Back taxes mount in county

BYLINE: Brandon Keat

LENGTH: 994 words


The $147 million owed to Allegheny County school districts in back taxes would
pay for 3,300 teachers at an annual salary of $45,000, or buy more than 140,000
computers for classrooms.

The county's delinquency rate dwarfs that in nearby counties. Experts blame the
unpaid taxes on industrial decline -- which shifted the tax burden from
corporations to homeowners -- but a bigger factor might be that Allegheny is one
of only two counties in the state not required to collect delinquent school,
municipal and county taxes through a county-run tax claim bureau.

The other county, Philadelphia, has just one school district and one
municipality -- the urban district and the city itself. By comparison, Allegheny
is made up of 43 school districts and 131 municipalities, each left on its own
when tackling delinquent taxes.

"In Allegheny County, it's a free-for-all," said Ben Avon Heights-based
municipal finance consultant Michael Weir, who studied the issue while working
for the Pennsylvania Economy League. "They can each do it however they want to
do it."

The school tax delinquency rate is $118 for each person in Allegheny County, 13
times higher than the $9 per person rate in Westmoreland County and more than 17
times the $6.72 per person rate in Beaver County.

The result is unwieldy debt that forces those who pay to carry the tax load for
those who don't.

Taxpayers owe Pittsburgh Public Schools $41 million -- more than three times the
delinquent taxes owed in Beaver, Butler, Westmoreland and Washington counties
combined. Woodland Hills is owed $7.5 million, and Penn Hills, $6.5 million.

Districts take different approaches to getting the money. Some delegate the task
to solicitors. Others hire private attorneys or collection agencies. Still
others sell their tax liens outright. A few publish lists of debtors with the
hope of shaming them into paying.

At least some districts have found ways that work.

Shaler Area began getting tough on delinquent taxpayers in 2004, sending letters
to its top 60 scofflaws with a warning that the district would take "appropriate
action" if the taxes weren't paid. The response was swift. Some people sent
payments topping $25,000.

Since then, the district has whittled its delinquent debt from $7 million to
$5.8 million.

"We just looked at the top numbers and started a concentrated effort to try to
collect," said district business director Charles Bennett. "It's amazing when
you put on a little pressure -- all of a sudden they come up with a check for
you."

East Allegheny has collected nearly $2 million in back taxes over the last two
years, said district business manager Roger D'Emidio.

Still, the district is owed at least $3 million in delinquent taxes, D'Emidio
said. He said he has never added up the total "because I don't want to faint."

Said D'Emidio: "I honestly feel that if we could collect this money, we wouldn't
have to raise taxes," something the district has done in five of the last 13
years.

Shifting to a centralized tax bureau -- though not a panacea -- would help ease
the problem, some experts and district business managers say.

"It could take the pressure off the districts," Bennett said. "If it's
successful in other counties, I don't see why it wouldn't work in Allegheny
County."

In Westmoreland County, the tax claim bureau gathers the delinquent tax accounts
in January and, if non-payers do not begin payments after receiving letters in
April and then January, begins preparations for a tax sale. Sales are on the
second Monday in September -- fewer than two years after the account becomes
delinquent.

North Hills finance director David Hall said the process is not as smooth or
uniform in Allegheny County.

"Under the Allegheny County process it's considerably more difficult,
time-consuming and expensive to force a delinquent sale," he said. As a result,
properties are less likely to be put up for sheriff's sale and people feel less
pressure to pay their back taxes.

A centralized bureau would be a small step toward righting the county's tax and
assessment system, but one worth taking, said Robert Strauss, a professor at
Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz School of Public Policy.

"What you get from that is professionalization and economies of scale, and a
transparent process," Strauss said. "It's a microcosm of good government."

Getting marginal properties -- vacant houses or small pieces of land that lack
traceable owners -- on the tax rolls could be easier under a centralized system,
some business managers said.

When county and local taxing bodies are pursuing payment, it "becomes
economically unfeasible to sell marginal property," Hall said. "By the time
you've gone through the legal gyrations, you'd have far more money in it than
you could ever get out of it in the sale, so nothing happens. They just sit
there for 50 years."

Mike Kohlman, director of Beaver County's tax claim bureau, said the convoluted
system in Allegheny County, where different entities might own liens on a single
property, discourages people from buying the land.

"When you've got three different collection processes, it can be quite
confusing," he said. "Here, you buy it once -- baby, you're done."

Still, some districts are wary of turning delinquent tax collection over to a
county agency.

Plum, for example, would insist that the county give assurances of doing a
better job than the district does in collecting back taxes through a private
attorney, district spokeswoman Dawn Check said. The district is owed $1.67
million.

"We're not just going to say, 'Oh, let somebody else do it,' " Check said.

Many local officials are skeptical of the county's ability to handle the job and
may be reluctant to cede power or responsibility, Strauss said.

"They don't trust county government. ... Parochialism is present everywhere," he
said. Establishing a tax claim bureau "is a step forward, but getting these
officials to go along with anything is just a nightmare."

Boost in home values may motivate owners to pay, expert says.

BYLINE:  By Kimberly Miller   Palm Beach Post Staff Writer

SECTION: A SECTION; Pg. 1A

LENGTH: 709 words


A double-digit home price climb for South Florida and fewer late mortgage
payments in Palm Beach County combined Tuesday to paint a mostly rosy picture
for the revving retail season.

But economists are still cautious of a real estate slowdown and are wary of the
reasons behind the 4 percentage point drop from last year in September's
delinquent loans.

According to the Irvine, Calif.-based CoreLogic, 11.6 percent of Palm Beach
County mortgages in September were 90 days or more past due, slightly lower than
the statewide rate of 12 percent. About 5 percent of mortgages nationally were
seriously delinquent in September, down 1.5 percentage points from last year.

Two years ago, 18 percent of Palm Beach County's mortgages were 90 days or more
delinquent.

"A lot of people who were underwater see their values back up and have an added
incentive to make their house payments because they'll be in a positive equity
situation soon," said Jack McCabe, chief executive of McCabe Research &
Consulting in Deerfield Beach.

Home values grow

Home prices in Palm Beach, Broward and Miami-Dade counties gained 14 percent in
September from the same time last year on the Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller
home price index, trumping the national increase of 11 percent measured during
the third quarter.

Homeowners with unaffordable mortgages may also be able to sell more easily as
their home value rises.

Still, the continued flush of foreclosures from the system also contributes to
the reduction in late payments, maybe even more so than rising prices, McCabe
said.

"First and foremost, so many of the foreclosures have been processed and have
been taken out of the late payment data," McCabe said. "I don't think it's
employment propping that up because the jobs we've seen created are a lot of
lower-paying service-type jobs."

Palm Beach County's unemployment rate fell to 6.7 percent in October from 7.1
percent in September.

"The further we get away from the economic crisis and financial downturn, the
fewer people who are going into foreclosure," said CoreLogic Chief Economist
Mark Fleming, who noted a normal rate of loan delinquency is less than 2
percent. "A healthier housing market as a backdrop certainly helps."

Nationally, the 20 regions measured by the Case-Shiller price index had
increases of 13 percent compared with September of last year.

Prices were up 0.7 percent from August. Las Vegas saw the biggest annual
increase at 29 percent, followed by San Francisco's 26 percent.

Tampa, the only other region in Florida measured by the index, increased 14.5
percent from last year.

While South Florida's index level continues to climb, September prices were
still 38 percent below the peak in December 2006.

The Case-Shiller index measures sales compared with January 2000 when the index
was set at 100. For each region reviewed, the index provides a three-month
moving average price. It does not include condominium sales.

David Blitzer, chairman of the Index Committee, said the 11 percent growth in
the third quarter nationally was the strongest since real estate peaked in 2006.
The big gains in Las Vegas and San Francisco have some worried about another
price bubble, but Blitzer said South Florida's price climbs are slowing.

Cash deals may slow

"My sense is South Florida will gradually slide to a point where a year from now
it will be up 4 to 5 percent, not 14 percent by any means," Blitzer said. "That
is the market settling."

McCabe's betting on even higher annual price gains of between 8 percent and 10
percent for the next two years, but worries what will happen when foreign buyers
and Wall Street hedge funds fall out of the market. Both groups have been a big
part of South Florida's housing recovery, McCabe said.

Traditional buyers will have to take up the slack to keep prices stable. Some
may welcome the opportunity to bid without cash competition.

Former Riviera Beach resident Michael Lewis searched off and on for two years to
find a home in Palm Beach County near his job off 45th Street. Outbid time and
time again, he finally settled in September on a home in less competitive Port
St. Lucie.

"I really didn't want to come this far north," Lewis said. "I'm happy, but the
drive is another thing."

JPMorgan, HSBC, Regions Planning to Sell Nonperforming Loans

BYLINE: Bloomberg News

SECTION: MANAGING REO; Pg. 28 Vol. 18 No. 04

LENGTH: 513  words


JPMorgan Chase & Co. is offering $390 million of nonperforming loans as banks
including HSBC Holdings Plc and Regions Financial Corp. increasingly look to
sell troubled mortgage debt.

JPMorgan put the pool of debt, a portion of which is tied to residential
properties in New York, on the market in early February, said two people with
knowledge of the offering, who asked not to be named because the sale is
private.

HSBC hired BlackRock Inc. to manage the potential sale of as much as $1 billion
in delinquent loans and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is handling an auction of about
$700 million of modified loans for Regions, according to two separate people.

Sales of the debt are accelerating amid financial regulations that force banks
to pledge more capital for some assets they hold, including nonperforming loans,
or NPLs. The government also is adding to the supply as it auctions the debt to
help prevent foreclosures and stem losses at the Federal Housing Administration.

"Banks have made a decision internally that a delinquent borrower is not a core
customer," Ashish Pandey, chief executive officer of Altisource Residential
Corp., said at a conference in Las Vegas in January. Pandey, whose firm had
6,300 delinquent loans as of the third quarter of 2013, said he expects as many
as 500,000 nonperforming loans to sell in 2014.

Potential buyers of nonperforming loans, tied to delinquent borrowers who
haven't yet lost their homes to foreclosure, include hedge-fund firms such as
Ellington Management Group LLC and One William Street Capital Management LP. The
firms are seeking alternative housing bets after subprime-mortgage bond prices
jumped about 17% last year and property prices surged 24% from their 2012 low.

Values increased as the economy strengthened and firms led by Blackstone Group
LP bought more than 366,200 single-family homes in cities such as Phoenix and
Atlanta since January 2011 to turn into rentals, according to Port Street Realty
and RealtyTrac data. That's made delinquent loans a relatively cheaper way to
acquire real estate or profit by working with borrowers who are behind on
mortgage payments.

There are about 1.3 million properties in the U.S. tied to loans at least 90
days late and not yet in foreclosure, according to Black Knight Financial
Services. Another 4.5 million borrowers are at least 30 days delinquent or in
the repossession process, a Black Knight report showed last week.

Regions transferred $686 million of loans classified as troubled debt
restructurings to held-for-sale in the fourth quarter, the bank said on a Jan.
21 call with investors. The majority of the loans were originated prior to 2007
and about 40% are located in Florida.

Amy Bonitatibus, a spokeswoman for New York-based JPMorgan, declined to comment
on the bank's offering. Rob Sherman, an HSBC spokesman, and BlackRock's Brian
Beades, declined to comment on the potential loan sale. Michael DuVally, a
spokesman for Goldman Sachs and Evelyn Mitchell, a spokeswoman for Birmingham,
Ala.-based Regions, declined to comment on Goldman Sachs's role in the offering.

City seeking late fees for mobile homes

BYLINE: AMELIA DAVIS

SECTION: LARGO-SEMINOLE TIMES; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 460 words

DATELINE: LARGO



LARGO - It's 10 months past the deadline, and 810 of Largo's 10,315    mobile
home owners still have not purchased their 1988 license tags.

     The city could pick up about $ 35,000 from its share of the    delinquent
fees, commissioners learned Thursday.

     The school district also gets about $ 35,000, and the State    Department
of Motor Vehicles, which collects the license fee, keeps    about $ 5,000 to
cover administrative costs.

     City commissioners tentatively agreed Thursday to allow Community
Development director Ric Goss to hire an inspector to collect the    delinquent
fees.

      The fee depends on the length and width of the mobile home. It    applies
only to mobile-home owners who rent their space. Those who own    the space on
which their homes stand pay property tax instead.

     Commissioners face dwindling savings and a 49 percent tax increase
unless they either cut city services or find new ways to bring in more    money.


     "I can make you this commitment, that I'll save you more money    than what
you will pay" in salary, Goss said.

     Collecting the delinquent mobile home fees is not a priority for    state
officials, Goss said, because they keep such a small amount of    the money.

     As an example, "the state has one inspector to collect delinquent    fees
in the whole Tampa Bay area," Goss said.

     The state "is telling the cities, 'if you want that money, you go
collect it,' " said Largo Mayor George McGough, who lives in a mobile    home
park.

     McGough suggested that the city require mobile home park managers    to
collect the delinquent fees from residents in their parks.

     Goss passed a computer list of delinquent owners to commissioners.

     "Three of my neighbors are on this list," said Commissioner Jean
Halvorsen, who also lives in a mobile home park. "Most of these people    I know
personally."

     Goss said it was Commissioner Jim Miles who suggested checking up    on the
number of delinquencies after Miles "heard people were not    paying."

     McGough said he hoped Miles was not targeting mobile home owners as    tax
dodgers.

     Miles assured him he wasn't.

     "I get the impression that some people would like to see all of us    put
our wheels on and get out of town," McGough said.

     "Oh, no," said Commissioner Ned Ford. "Largo would lose a    mayor."

     Goss noted that in only three months, mobile homes will need 1989
licenses.

     "Now is the time to collect," Goss said.

Carbon seeks info from 5 taxing bodies

BYLINE: Tom Ragan, Standard-Speaker, Hazleton, Pa.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 674 words


Sep. 28--JIM THORPE -- Carbon County wants to avoid going to court over
delinquent tax information it is having difficulty obtaining from four school
districts and a borough.

The county commissioners, at last week's meeting, tabled hiring legal help and
will try to set up meetings with the Hazleton Area, Weatherly Area, Jim Thorpe
and Panther Valley school districts and Summit Hill Borough.

All five taxing bodies had hired Portnoff Law Associates to collect delinquent
real estate taxes in recent years.

In fact, according to Commissioner Chairman William O'Gurek, Panther Valley
continues to use the Philadelphia-area firm to collect delinquent property
taxes. The other school districts and Summit Hill no longer use Portnoff.

One of the problems with Portnoff noted by O'Gurek was the costs associated with
its collections. O'Gurek said the firm would charge a delinquent taxpayer $150
to open the file and another $150 to file a lien on the property.

"Now you have a $300 cost on a taxpayer who couldn't afford to pay their taxes
in the first place," O'Gurek said.

In Monroe County, the Pennsylvania Land Title Association took the East
Stroudsburg and Pleasant Valley school districts to court to restore the records
to the Monroe County Tax Claim Bureau to ensure the accurate satisfaction of
municipal liens filed in the county prothonotary's office.

After being heard in Monroe County and Commonwealth courts, the case reached the
state Supreme Court, which refused to hear it and sent it back to Commonwealth
Court. That upheld the original decision by Monroe County Judge Ronald E. Vican
ordering the two school districts to make the information available to the tax
claim bureau.

"It was nothing but a big nightmare," said Greg Christine, director of the
Monroe County Tax Claim Bureau.

Christine said his office is now managing delinquent tax collections for all of
the 20 municipalities and four school districts in Monroe County and for the
most part it has been a smooth transition. However, some of the tax records
handed over by Portnoff date back to 2002 and his office staff must make
determinations on some of the older delinquent cases, he said.

"How are we going to collect from taxpayers that were delinquent and haven't
paid since 2002? I can tell you that those (properties) will be either sold at a
tax sale or (the taxes) are going to be paid. We are still in a transition
period," Christine said.

As for Carbon County, the commissioners are hoping to get the required
information from the five taxing bodies without a court fight. They said at
Thursday's meeting that their action was prompted by the Monroe County case.

"We just want to explain to them what the courts have said and that the
responsiblility of collecting taxes should be with the tax claim bureau and our
need to have the tax record information in the county," O'Gurek said.

He explained that when someone wants to do a title search and that information
isn't available, it leads to a variety of questions about what liens are on
certain properties.

"When someone does check with our tax claim bureau, the information will be
accurate and up to date and that we are indemnified from any misinformation that
may have been caused by those taxing entities by privatizing their collection
efforts," O'Gurek said.

Carbon County is using the Monroe County case as a measuring stick through the
state court system because it ruled in favor of the tax claim bureau being the
delinquent collection agency in that county, according to O'Gurek.

"We need the information for all of the tax years in question," O'Gurek said.

200 businesses owe $6.6M

BYLINE: By RICHARD FELLINGER Public Opinion Harrisburg Bureau

SECTION: LOCAL

LENGTH: 702 words


At a time when every dollar of state revenue counts, officials are trying to
track down nearly $6.6 million in delinquent taxes from more than 200 businesses
in Pennsylvania.

The Department of Revenue last week updated its tax-delinquent list, which shows
225 businesses that failed to pay certain taxes to the state. Each business
either collected sales taxes from its customers or withholding taxes from its
employees, or both.

One Franklin County business is listed among the delinquent taxpayers:
Knuckleheads Original Self Service Motorcycle Center of Chambersburg, which was
listed for owing $19,310. Knuckleheads has a disconnected phone number and could
not be reached for comment.

Businesses owing the state the most are Crisman Harwood Flooring of Pottstown,
which was listed for owing $175,032; New Jersey-based Sequel Solutions Plus,
owing $161,265; and K&D Jewelers of Bethlehem, owing $139,460.

Thirty-eight businesses were added last week to the list, which is updated
quarterly. The new listings include East Penn Container Decorating of Berks
County, owing $94,861.

While the state faces a budget crisis that developed in recent months, the list
is not new. State officials created it in 2006, hoping the publicity and
accompanying court action would pressure businesses into paying up.

State officials file a lien against each business in county court, which
essentially freezes their finances and ensures the state gets paid if the
business is sold.

And the state promotes the list. When the updated list was released last week,
Acting Revenue Secretary Stephen Stetler encouraged people to check it out on
the department's Web site at www.revenue.state.pa.us.

While $6.6 million is a small fraction of the state's $28 billion budget, the
delinquent taxes serve up a reminder that the state is scraping to get through
this year. Gov. Ed Rendell has estimated a $2.3 billion budget shortfall this
year, and has cut programs and frozen most state hiring to help cover it.

State officials give delinquent businesses several chances to pay up, Revenue
Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Brassell said. Revenue officials contact each
business several times and also offer them a payment plan to catch up, she said.

Often just the threat of being put on the list encourages business owners to
pay, Brassell said. Since the list was started, delinquent businesses have paid
$87 million and started payments plans for an additional $20.7 million after
being threatened with the list, she said.

Yet collecting from some businesses can be hard, because some go out of
business.

Among them is Smokey Joes Barbeque Grille in York, which closed last summer and
was listed for owing $24,474. A message left at a forwarding phone number for
owner Joseph Whitehead was not returned for this story.

Other owners don't like to talk about their situation. A woman at B&T Towing &
Auto in York County, which was listed for owing $16,309, hung up when contacted
by phone for this story.

Still others say they've fallen on hard times and need a chance to catch up.
Karen Whitaker, co-owner of Lebanon's Whitaker Cleaning Systems, which was
listed for owing $23,173, said the bad economy has hurt their finances.

She said they want to pay their delinquent tax bill and have been trying. She
said their business had been on a payment plan to stay off the list, but was
unable to keep the payments this winter.

The bad publicity hurts their business even more, Whitaker said.

"This is just making it worse for businesses. Businesses are struggling now. I'm
just mortified over this whole thing," she said.

Brassell said revenue officials who track down the late taxes are doing a job
for the benefit of all taxpayers, and businesses that pay their taxes shouldn't
have to carry the burden for those that don't.

"It's really a matter of tax fairness as well," she said.

Tax sales drop in Cambria as most delinquents pay up

BYLINE: Sandra K. Reabuck, Tribune-Democrat, Johnstown, Pa.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 404 words


Sep. 9--EBENSBURG -- Twenty-two properties sold for $35,875 Monday at Cambria
County's annual delinquent tax sale, officials said.

That number is slightly lower than the 35 to 40 sold each year, said Sam Runzo,
director of the county tax claim bureau.

But the good news is that most of the 1,300 properties originally advertised for
the sale were taken off the auction block because the delinquent taxes were
paid, either partially or in full, Runzo said.

More than $1 million was collected in back taxes and fees from the time the
properties were advertised in July until Monday's sale, he said.

Most of the money collected goes to school districts, townships and boroughs,
although some also is for delinquent county property taxes, Runzo said.

Only 260 properties ended up on the auction block.

The top price paid for a single property was $6,000 for a lot with a house along
Maderan Street in Northern Cambria Borough.

Buyer Robin Quist of Hastings said that it's an investment for her and her
husband, Joseph, a self-employed contractor.

She said that a tenant thereâ[#x20ac]" thought by the Quists to be the owner --
left without paying the $5,000 tab for a new heating system that the Quists
installed.

"We can't find that person, and he stuck us with a $5,000 unpaid bill," she
said. "This was the only way we had to get our money. (The property) eventually
will be resold."

Thomas Hollis of Fallentimber had no comment about the 5.6-acre parcel in Croyle
Township that he purchased for $2,700. It had been owned by the Wilmore
Sportsmen's Association.

The least paid by a buyer was $253.74, the amount due on a vacant lot along
Birch Street in Franklin Borough. The buyer was the borough. Council President
Richard McNulty could not be reached for comment.

One well-known property still on the auction block -- the former Moose Home
Association at 306 Bedford St. in Johnsown -- attracted no buyers, Runzo said.
Assessment records list the owner as Dirk Voories of Altoona, with $35,221 owed
in back taxes.

USF's Green Latest Bull To Be Arrested

BYLINE: BRETT McMURPHY, bmcmurphy@tampatrib.com

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 3

LENGTH: 759 words


By BRETT McMURPHY

bmcmurphy@tampatrib.com

TAMPA -- DeJuan Green, South Florida's leading rusher last season, owes more
than $2,500 in delinquent child support payments.

Green owes Lavander Yvette Collier, who gave birth to their daughter, Lavonya
Dejuna Green, on Feb. 19, 1998, $2,526.82, a Duval County child support
spokeswoman said.

Green, who has no eligibility remaining at USF, is the second Bull arrested in
the past few weeks for delinquent child support payments. Senior wide receiver
Brian Fisher was arrested March 22 for owing nearly $17,500 in delinquent
payments to two women.

A 1999 graduate of Jacksonville Raines, Green said he spoke with Collier, who
lives in Jacksonville, Sunday and "she plans on taking me off [being responsible
for payments].

"I talk to her and my daughter all the time," Green said. "I love my daughter.
The reason I'm so far behind is because I can't get a job [as a scholarship
student-athlete]. I don't want my mom to pay for it. It's my responsibility.
I'll take care of it the best way I can. I'm paying a little money here and
there."

Green's last payment was $500 on March 22, the Duval County spokeswoman said.
Green said he got the $500 from the $1,700 Pell Grant he receives at the start
of each semester.

Since transferring from Georgia to USF in 2001 Green has been arrested three
times -- March 8 for contempt of court, failing to pay child support; Feb. 14,
2003, for providing a false name to a law enforcement officer (using teammate
Elgin Hicks' name) and two counts of driving with a suspended/revoked license;
and Sept. 9, 2001, driving with a suspended/revoked license.

Gene Burrough, Green's agent, said he wouldn't be surprised if Green is selected
in the NFL draft, April 24-25. Green recorded the fastest 40 (4.47) at USF's Pro
Timing Day March 19.

"I don't think he's a household name because he went to a team that threw a
lot," Burrough said. "But he will be a household name in the NFL. He'll be one
of the great players in the NFL. This kid is outstanding. He's a true,
legitimate big-time back."

Last season Green led USF in yards rushing (490) and rushing TDs (five). He was
one of two Bulls selected for the Blue-Gray All-Star Game, rushing for 21 yards
on six carries on Christmas Day.

Hurricanes Spend Extra Time Watching Movies

CORAL GABLES -- Miami took to the practice field Monday for the first time since
Friday's defense-dominated scrimmage, but only after putting in some extra film
study in an attempt to correct the offense's multiple mistakes.

"We needed that," Coach Larry Coker said. "We had, I think, 77 plays. So we
needed to really evaluate that and get some good things out of that.

"I just told our team, the things that we did wrong are correctable.

"And it's up to us to correct them. We've got six workouts left in the spring.
We don't have an exhibition game. We start out with Florida State. We've got to
get a lot done in these last six practices."

Of the 77 plays Friday night, 62 were full-contact, 11-on-11 work, and the
offense amassed just 297 yards, two touchdowns and a pair of field goals over
that stretch. Miami's defense stole the show, racking up 10 sacks, recovering
four fumbles and generally creating havoc.

"The passing game was terrible," Coker said. "We had virtually no completions.
Our protection wasn't good enough. We've got to get a lot better there, no doubt
about it.

"I think they're a little embarrassed, and they should be."

SHULA RESTORES AWARD: At Tuscaloosa, Ala., Alabama coach Mike Shula reinstated
Sylvester Croom's name to a spring award Monday, reversing a decision that
angered some former players and Crimson Tide fans.

Shula, who was away on a fundraising cruise last week, apologized for renaming
the Sylvester Croom Commitment to Excellence Award after former Alabama
quarterback Bart Starr.

"Our original intention was to not have an award named after another head coach
in the SEC," Shula said. "However, we need to fully recognize and value the deep
feelings of all our players about their years and contributions to our great
university."

Croom, a finalist for Alabama's coaching job last May and like Shula a former
Bucs assistant, was hired at Mississippi State after the season, the
Southeastern Conference's first black head football coach.

COLORADO: Placed assistant defensive coach Vance Joseph on leave amid a
recruiting scandal that includes rape allegations and other misconduct by
football players.

Property Tax Crackdown Turns on Seizure Policy;
County Sending Sheriffs to Take Valuables From Residents Delinquent on Bill

Carlos Sanchez, Washington Post Staff Writer

SECTION: VIRGINIA WEEKLY; PAGE V1

LENGTH: 555 words


In his 23 years with the Prince William County sheriff's office, Lt. Richard S.
Griffith Jr. had never seen it happen before.

Last Friday, as Griffith prepared to seize Occoquan resident Ron Houghton's car
because of unpaid personal property taxes, Houghton asked Griffith to wait while
he ran to the bank. Twenty minutes later, Houghton was back, presenting a
stunned Griffith with 36 $ 100 bills and some change to clear his account.

"That's the first time in my 23 years where they said, 'Sheriff, I'll get you
the cash now,' " Griffith said.

County officials hope that is a good omen for the unprecedented tax collection
effort they launched 10 days ago. With delinquent personal property taxes
totaling more than $ 11 million, they have vowed to dispatch a sheriff's deputy
at least once a month to seize scofflaws' property and auction it off if taxes
aren't paid within 45 days.

The crackdown is being led by County Cashier Mike Longhi. County officials
credit Longhi for the success of a collection campaign that has netted $ 12.4
million in delinquent real estate taxes in the last 18 months. But Longhi said
that closing the more than 35,000 delinquent personal property accounts in the
county will be a more daunting task.

"One of the reasons it's so hard to collect is that personal property, by its
nature, is easy to transport," he said. "You can't move real estate."

But Longhi promises an aggressive campaign in which sheriff's deputies will pay
frequent visits to delinquent taxpayers to seize vehicles and, in the case of
unpaid business licensing taxes, assets such as computers. Past collection
efforts were sporadic, he said.

Longhi would not fully explain how the county will decide which delinquent
taxpayers get a visit from the sheriff's office. He did say, however, that any
evidence that someone is making an effort to pay their debt generally works in
their favor.

The first phase of the collection effort involves 40 tax accounts totaling $
800,000, and 70 orders to seize property or serve notice that seizure is
imminent. One account may represent several pieces of property, Longhi
explained.

All of those accounts are at least two years overdue and in some cases date to
1988, Longhi said. The list includes business delinquencies ranging from $
50,000 to $ 250,000 and individual delinquencies from $ 2,000 to $ 6,000.

As of the end of last week, about $ 69,000 of those taxes had been collected. In
addition, Griffith had seized five vehicles and one backhoe.

While he takes the philosophy, "If I pay my taxes, then everybody else should
pay theirs," Griffith admits his job sometimes can be tough. One of his first
seizures in Nokesville last week, he said, turned into a sad chore.

"I had to take a lady's car, and she was crying so hard that her children
started to cry," he said. "Then the grandmother accused me of spoiling Christmas
for them. It was hard."

Houghton, who works in real estate, said he had not paid personal property taxes
on his car and truck because of tough economic times and a dispute with the
county over his tax assessment.

"We were aware of the tax situation, but we were not expecting the sheriff,"
Houghton said. "We were fortunate because we just closed on a property. If the
sheriff had come last week, he would have had to take the car."

City to increase sheriff sales in get-tough move;
The bid follows an Inquirer report on lax property-tax collection.

BYLINE: By Bob Warner; Inquirer Staff Writer

After promising tougher enforcement for more than a year, the Nutter
administration is planning a stiff run-up in the number of tax-delinquent
properties to be auctioned off at city sheriff sales.

City Finance Director Rob Dubow and Revenue Commissioner Keith Richardson said
last week that they expect to offer 200 tax-delinquent properties at a sheriff's
sale next month, and raise the number to 600 a month by January 2012.

By comparison, over 11 years from 2000 through 2010, the city tried to sell just
100 tax-delinquent properties a month, and barely half those sales went through,
according to figures provided by the Sheriff's Department last year.

"We're not trying to move people out of their homes," Richardson said in an
interview. "We're just trying to get them to take seriously their responsibility
to the city and School District. . . . When people start to recognize we're
really serious, we'll get more people coming to us to work out payment
agreements."

The two men spoke in response to The Inquirer's report last week that described
Philadelphia's property-tax collection system as the least effective among the
nation's big cities.

More than 110,000 Philadelphia properties, nearly one in five, are delinquent,
their owners at least nine months overdue in paying their real estate tax bills.

The problem costs the city and School District millions of dollars in revenue -
$232 million in unpaid taxes, penalties, and interest over the last 10 years,
according to a Revenue Department report - and plays a major role in creating
and sustaining urban blight.

A national authority on property-tax collection systems, law professor Frank S.
Alexander of Emory University in Atlanta, described the city's delinquency
levels as "astronomical."

"Those numbers tell you there is a very high rate of nonenforcement," Alexander
said. "It means that the city has made a decision not to go after those
properties."

In an article in this issue of The Inquirer, Dubow and Richardson say the Nutter
administration views Philadelphia's legacy of tax delinquency and vacant
property as "one of the biggest challenges facing the city."

They say the city has already taken steps to strengthen tax collections and is
developing new policies to deal with vacant land, an effort involving multiple
city agencies, community-development corporations, private developers and City
Council.

In recent years, the bulk of real estate in sheriff sales has been foreclosed on
by lenders after owners failed to pay mortgages. The number of properties forced
into sheriff sales by the city because of unpaid real estate taxes has been
relatively small - although the totals are suspect because of record-keeping
problems at the Sheriff's Department, now under review by a variety of auditors,
law firms, and law enforcement agents.

Records provided last year by aides to John Green, the former sheriff, put the
number of tax-related sheriff sales at 128 properties in all of 2010, the lowest
figure in the last 11 years.

A Revenue Department database shows 224 tax-related sales in 2010, down from 257
in 2008 and 328 in 2009, Richardson said. Those annual figures could be matched
in a single month if the city follows through with the expansion it promises.

Dubow said the small number of sheriff sales last year was attributable to two
factors: the tax amnesty program that represented the city's major revenue
thrust the first half of 2010, and the bookkeeping problems that consumed the
Sheriff's Department toward the end of the year, prompting a scathing audit by
City Controller Alan Butkovitz and a five-month suspension of sheriff sales
beginning in December.

The amnesty allowed delinquent taxpayers to settle balances for the original
taxes due, no penalties, and just half the calculated interest payments. The
program raised $73 million, about $24 million of that being delinquent property
taxes, according to the city.

As the amnesty program was ending in June 2010, the city promised tougher
collection efforts against delinquents who failed to take advantage of the
amnesty. The threats included tripling the number of properties put up for
sheriff sale for unpaid taxes, from 200 a month to 600.

But data suggest the city didn't even get the monthly volume up to 200.

York to cut off water when fees aren't paid

BYLINE: Emily Opilo, York Daily Record, Pa.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 540 words


March 21--YORK, Pa. -- York residents who owe sewer and refuse bills should
prepare to open their wallets.

As of May 1, officials will begin cutting off water service to properties that
have outstanding sewer and trash bills, city Business Administrator Michael
O'Rourke told members of city council Tuesday night.

The new policy, which has been considered by the city officials for at least
eight years, will be enacted to tackle the approximately $18 million currently
owed to the city by on about 4,500 delinquent properties, O'Rourke said. Much of
that amount is made up of penalties accrued by sewer and refuse users that
haven't paid for some time, he said.

The ultimate goal is to collect as much money as possible, not cause hardships,
O'Rourke said. For that reason the city will offer a one-month amnesty program
in April when delinquent customers can pay off an overdue balance or begin a
payment program in exchange for having all penalties waived.

After April 30, the city will begin taking the necessary steps to cut off the
water, beginning with the 15 most delinquent owners, O'Rourke said. An agreement
has already been signed with York Water Company for services to be cut after a
30- to 37-day window, depending on the type of property and adequate warning, he
said.

Tenant-occupied properties will receive special treatment because landlords, not
tenants, are legally responsible for paying sewer and refuse bills, O'Rourke
said. If the landlord fails to pay, a tenant can pay their share of the current
month's fee to the city to avoid a water shutoff, O'Rourke said.

As city officials grow accustomed to the program, additional rounds of customers
with delinquent fees will begin to see water shutoff notices, O'Rourke said.
Eventually, any customer more than 30 days overdue could face the same
punishment, he said.

York's large number of rental properties will make recuperating the funds
complicated, O'Rourke said. Some of the delinquent properties might be under
different ownership. Other owners could be dead. It will take time to sort out,
and the program might need to be adjusted or temporarily suspended, he said.

"If the process generates more revenue than the expenses to run it, then it's
probably worth going on," O'Rourke said.

Several members of council commended the city for making an attempt to
recuperate the money. It might be a nightmare trying to get the program started,
but recuperating even a fraction of what is owed would be worth trying, said
Councilman Henry Nixon

"There are an awful lot of city residents and landlords who pay on time," Nixon
said. "It's really these unscrupulous people stealing from people who pay."

Are you on the list?

The city has released a list of property owners most delinquent in their sewer
and refuse fees.

Topping the list is James Woodard who owes $99,656 in sewer and $32,142 in trash
for his property located on 330 W. Jackson St. One owner, Molt LLC, owns 36
properties in York. Of those 33 are delinquent, officials said.

Tax liens sale would fill coffers;
Plan lets investors collect past-due taxes

BYLINE: By Lynn Hulsey lhulsey@DaytonDailyNews.com

SECTION: LOCAL; Pg. B1

LENGTH: 469 words


DAYTON - Montgomery County commissioners appear prepared to approve a sale of
county tax liens that will bring past-due taxes into local coffers and cost
delinquent taxpayers additional money.

On Tuesday, county Treasurer Hugh Quill outlined his proposal to sell property
tax liens to investors, typically national banks, who would then collect the
delinquent taxes and penalties, plus a fee of up to 18 percent. The three
commissioners will be asked to approve the proposal next week and the two
commissioners at Tuesday's meeting - Debbie Lieberman and Charles Curran - both
expressed support for the idea.

The plan would whittle away at the nearly $61 million in tax delinquencies and
allow schools, cities, the county, libraries, Sinclair Community College and
other property tax recipients to get money owed them.

The sale would be held this year.

Quill expects to originally offer for sale tax liens on about 3,500 parcels with
about $13 million in past-due taxes. He said an estimated $6 million to $7
million of that will be collected from people who pay their past-due taxes prior
to the sale of their tax liens to avoid the higher fees.

He said vendors will bid on the block of parcels, which will be a mix of
high-value properties and those that are deemed difficult to collect.

Bidders offer the entire value of the delinquent taxes plus any penalties that
have accrued, and tack on their proposed fees.

Bidding starts at an 18 percent fee and goes down, with the bid award going to
the company offering to charge the lowest fee to the delinquent taxpayer. The
winning bidder would also pay about $75 per parcel to the treasurer for
administrative costs, Quill said.

If a property owner continues to miss tax payments after the lien is sold, the
winning bidder will have first rights to purchase additional tax liens on that
property and likely would charge the full 18 percent fee on the new
delinquencies, Quill said.

Quill had been reluctant to use an Ohio law that allows sale of the tax liens
because he didn't want to "pile on in bad times."

But he said people also need to meet their obligations.

The law contains provisions protecting people from aggressive tax collecting
measures and restricts the vendor from foreclosing on a property for at least
three years.

In addition, Quill will not sell tax liens on properties eligible for the
homestead exemption granted to income-eligible elderly or disabled people who
live in their homes.

Tax liens also will not be sold for properties worth less than $50,000, those in
active foreclosure or bankruptcy, those with active payment plans and those that
are "environmentally challenged."

Quill said he will continue working with county Prosecutor Mat Heck to collect
past-due taxes that remain in the county's portfolio of liens.

Time Of Essence When Owner Fails To Pay Maintenance Fees

Q. My inquiry concerns a delinquent owner who has not paid his maintenance fees
for five quarters and apparently failed to pay his mortgage.

Our lawyer and the bank have filed liens for nonpayment, and foreclosure actions
are in progress.

This owner and his houseguests use our community privileges such as the pool,
gym, photocopier, fax and computers. I feel these privileges should be denied
and his access card to these areas be canceled.

Our documents do not address this matter. Could you comment on the Florida
condominium statute that pertains to this matter or direct me to the specific
chapter in the statute?

J.M.

Naples

A. If the bank is foreclosing on the unit, your association stands a chance of
losing much of the amount due because the association usually stands second to
the mortgage. My question is why has the board waited so long?

The board needs to establish a collections policy immediately to lien and
foreclose any account that is delinquent. I suggest 60 to 90 days or a period
that your attorney would recommend to start the legal action.

After the short period, the board files a lien and then starts foreclosure to
protect the association from a larger loss.

As to banning common area rights, condominiums do not have the right to restrict
delinquent owners from using the facilities. Homeowners associations have the
right to restrict usage of the common areas if the documents have a restriction
(Florida statute 720.305).

The board is responsible for making every attempt to collect from delinquent
owners, and time is critical.


Q. I am newly elected to the board of directors. I plan to have a dinner party
for the past and current board members. It would be an appreciation gathering
for those who performed duties for the association.

Is it mandatory that any such social gathering be considered a board meeting
requiring a 48-hour notice and open to the members?

R.P.

Bonita Springs

A. I would not consider a social gathering such as you described a business
meeting requiring the notice.

Board members are people who are allowed to have social functions like any other
member of the association. I am sure that the board members will discuss some
history of past boards, but the key is if the current directors start to discuss
future plans or current operations.

As long as it is social, you should not be in violation of the statutes.

Vigo to send delinquent property tax notices next month

BYLINE: Howard Greninger, The Tribune-Star, Terre Haute, Ind.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 382 words


June 30--A measure to collect unpaid personal property taxes has enabled Vigo
County to collect more than $390,000 since 2013.

Three years ago, Vigo County Treasurer Jim Bramble sent out more than 2,400
notices of unpaid personal property taxes. It's part of the job of a county
treasurer to certify delinquent personal property taxes, but it had not been
done since at least 2000.

Now, only a couple of hundred notices of unpaid taxes will be sent out next
month.

"We have made a lot of progress on this, keeping the delinquencies down by
pursuing payment on a regular basis," Bramble said Wednesday.

Personal property taxes are delinquent if not paid after Nov. 10. Before the
first day in August of the next year, the treasurer is to send out a demand
notice, giving a taxpayer 30 days to pay. If not paid, the bill is sent to the
county clerk's office and entered as a court judgment, Bramble said.

Story continues below video

The county through 2014 had more than $9.9 million in unpaid personal property
taxes; however, many are from companies no longer in business or the tax bills
are decades old. The treasurer contracts with American Financial Credit Services
to recover some of those unpaid taxes.

As of this month, AFCS has collected $533,101. The company retains 25 percent of
that as its fee for researching and then collecting the unpaid taxes, many from
people or businesses no longer in the county. That has provided Vigo County with
$390,573 in revenue, which includes $38,214 in penalties charged by the county.

"We will never get $9.9 million back. Older debt is harder to collect. For
example, we had more than $1 million owed from Continental Airlines, which is no
longer in business," Bramble said. "But what this does by going through a
collection agency, it gets [those] delinquent taxes off our books, and it
doesn't cost us anything to collect it. Part of this process is how we clean bad
debt off our books, so we are not continuously sending out bills for taxes that
we will never receive," Bramble said.

JPMorgan, HSBC, Regions to Sell Nonperforming Loans

BYLINE: Bloomberg News

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 25 Vol. 38 No. 21

LENGTH: 514  words


JPMorgan Chase & Co. is offering $390 million of nonperforming loans as banks
including HSBC Holdings and Regions Financial Corp. increasingly look to sell
troubled mortgage debt.

JPMorgan put the pool of debt, a portion of which is tied to residential
properties in New York, on the market this week, said two people with knowledge
of the offering, who asked not to be named because the sale is private.

HSBC hired BlackRock Inc. to manage the potential sale of as much as $1 billion
in delinquent loans and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is handling an auction of about
$700 million of modified loans for Regions Financial Corp., according to two
separate people.

Sales of the debt are accelerating amid financial regulations that force banks
to pledge more capital for some assets they hold, including nonperforming loans,
or NPLs. The government also is adding to the supply as it auctions the debt to
help prevent foreclosures and stem losses at the Federal Housing Administration.

"Banks have made a decision internally that a delinquent borrower is not a core
customer," Ashish Pandey, the chief executive officer of Altisource Residential
Corp., said at a conference held in Las Vegas last month.

Pandey, whose firm had 6,300 delinquent loans as of the third quarter of 2013,
said he expects as many as 500,000 nonperforming loans to sell in 2014.

Potential buyers of nonperforming loans, tied to delinquent borrowers who
haven't yet lost their homes to foreclosure, include hedge-fund firms such as
Ellington Management Group LLC and One William Street Capital Management LP.

The firms are seeking alternative housing bets after subprime-mortgage bond
prices jumped about 17% last year and property prices surged 24% from their 2012
low.

Values increased as the economy strengthened and firms led by Blackstone Group
LP bought more than 366,200 single-family homes in cities such as Phoenix and
Atlanta since January 2011 to turn into rentals, according to Port Street Realty
and RealtyTrac data.

That's made delinquent loans a relatively cheaper way to acquire real estate or
profit by working with borrowers who are behind on mortgage payments.

There are about 1.3 million properties in the U.S. tied to loans at least 90
days late and not yet in foreclosure, according to Black Knight Financial
Services.

Another 4.5 million borrowers are at least 30 days delinquent or in the
repossession process, a Black Knight report showed last week.

Regions transferred $686 million of loans classified as troubled debt
restructurings to held-for-sale in the fourth quarter, the bank said on a Jan.
21 call with investors.

The majority of the loans were originated prior to 2007 and about 40% are
located in Florida.

Amy Bonitatibus, a spokeswoman for New York-based JPMorgan, declined to comment
on the bank's offering.

Rob Sherman, an HSBC spokesman, and BlackRock's Brian Beades, declined to
comment on the potential loan sale. Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman
Sachs and Evelyn Mitchell, a spokeswoman for Birmingham, Ala.-based Regions,
declined to comment on Goldman Sachs's role in the offering.

City to aid residents on brink of foreclosure;
Delinquent taxpayers can get counseling

BYLINE: By Brian Meyer - NEWS STAFF REPORTER

SECTION: LOCAL; Pg. B3

LENGTH: 621 words


Buffalo's vacancy crisis, already the third worst in the nation, could get a lot
worse if the latest round of delinquent taxpayers -- more than 3,400 of them --
let their homes fall into foreclosure.

City Hall, however, is taking steps to avoid that scary scenario.

"We don't want to take somebody's home," said Martin F. Kennedy, the city's
assessment and taxation commissioner. "We're really trying to bend over
backwards to help anyone."

One of the first steps in doing that occurred when Sharon Townsend,
administrative judge for the 8th Judicial District, met with city employees to
plan counseling sessions to be held in October.

People who are behind in their taxes and garbage user fee will have a chance to
meet with attorneys to arrange court-ordered payment plans, which would prevent
their properties from being auctioned at a city foreclosure sale scheduled for
Oct. 20-22.

In recent years, many of those homes could not be sold at auction and
subsequently fell to the city.

The result is a city that, by the end of this year, will own between 7,000 and
8,000 vacant homes and lots, a good chunk of the 12,000 to 18,000 vacant
properties in Buffalo.

The trend toward more and more foreclosed property falling to the city was
evident at last year's auction when more than 2,600 properties were put up for
sale, but only 674 received bids.

As of early July, there were 4,503 properties on this year's foreclosure list,
including 3,462 residential properties, 702 vacant lots and 339 commercial
parcels.

About two-thirds of the delinquent

properties are located on the city's East Side. The Fillmore District has the
largest number of properties on the foreclosure list. Nearly 28 percent of all
delinquent properties are in Fillmore, according to data released Wednesday by
Buffalo's CitiStat accountability panel.

Unlike many regions throughout the country that have witnessed an explosion of
foreclosures as a result of the mortgage crisis, Kennedy said Buffalo has not
seen a significant increase in the number of delinquent taxpayers. Tax officials
expect the number of parcels to shrink to close to last year's levels in the two
months leading up the fall auction.

But Kennedy said there's no doubt that many people are facing tough economic
times.

"I think the vast majority of people [on the foreclosure list] are people who
are having difficulty paying, as opposed to people who just refuse to pay," the
commissioner said.

Tax officials updated Mayor Byron W. Brown Wednesday on an upcoming effort to
help property owners who have fallen behind in paying their property taxes and
garbage user fee.

Lawyers will be stationed in the Erie County Courthouse on Oct. 14, 15 and 16,
at which time payment plans can be arranged. The Legal Aid Bureau of Buffalo,
Legal Services for the Elderly, Disabled or Disadvantaged of Western New York
and the Volunteer Lawyers Project have worked closely with the city on the
effort.

The city will contact block clubs, community leaders and even church pastors to
help spread the word about ways that struggling property owners can help avoid
seeing their homes placed on the auction block.

First Deputy Mayor Steven M. Casey underscored the importance of making sure the
city takes every step it possibly can to help people keep their homes. He said
he has heard "horror stories" about individuals losing their properties since
his days as a staffer in the State Senate.

The city already has sent out several letters to property owners. Two more will
be mailed next month and in September. Kennedy encouraged people who are having
a tough time paying their taxes to contact City Hall as soon as possible.

"Don't hide. The problem is not going to go away," said Kennedy.

County offering chances to buy up properties

BYLINE: NANCY J. SULOK, Tribune Staff Writer

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. B3

LENGTH: 465 words


SOUTH BEND - Psst. Wanna buy some property, cheap?

The county has a deal for you.

Actually, it has two deals.

One is in the form of a commissioners' sale, while the other is in the form of
the annual tax sale. The properties in both sales have delinquent property
taxes.

The commissioners' sale features properties that have had no takers in previous
tax sales. The county is trying the online sale in an effort to get them back on
the tax rolls.

The sale started Monday for 522 properties with houses on them. They will be
offered until Aug. 20. A sale of vacant lots will take place from Aug. 20 to
Sept. 2. The third phase of the sale will be Sept. 5-19 and will feature
commercial properties.

SRI Inc., an Indianapolis company, is in charge of the sale. To view the
property listings or bid on a property, go to www.sri-auctionsonline.com.

Instructions on the Web site describe the sale as similar to eBay, a popular
online auction site.

The site lists the property's address, key number, legal description, assessed
value and amount due. Minimum bids are listed for each property.

The properties are being sold at a reduced price, as authorized by statute. For
example, a property in the 500 block of West Colfax Avenue has an assessed value
of $27,900. Its owner owes taxes and penalties of $12,484, but the minimum bid
is $8,185.

The delinquent owners are not allowed to bid on the properties.

Payment is required the day after the sale closes and must be in the form of a
wire transfer or electronic fund transfer to a bank account included on the Web
site.

The annual tax sale is set for Oct. 8. The event will open at 8 a.m., but
bidding won't start until 10 a.m. SRI will be running that sale, too.

County Treasurer Sean Coleman said 3,195 properties are eligible for the October
sale because of delinquent taxes. The number is down from the 3,821 properties
that were on the sales list last year, he said.

Coleman sent out courtesy letters last month advising property owners they could
pay the delinquent taxes by Aug. 1 to avoid having sale fees attached to them.
At that time, Coleman said, around 6,000 properties were on the list for such
letters.

Many property owners took advantage of Coleman's letter and paid their taxes to
avoid the fees. The treasurer said the letters went out July 18, and his office
collected more than $3.9 million from July 23 through Aug. 2. The vast majority
of those payments resulted from the letters, he said.

SRI is sending out letters to the remaining delinquent owners to warn them their
properties will be offered for sale unless they pay the back taxes plus a $105
fee, by Oct. 7, the day before the sale. The fee covers the administrative costs
of listing a property for sale.

DELINQUENCY-CRIME LINK FAULTED

BYLINE: UPI

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 29


It is nearly impossible to predict whether juvenile delinquents, except those
with long histories of misbehavior, will become adult criminals, a
Government-backed study said today.

A six-year study tracking the criminal careers of more than 6,000 people in
Racine, Wis., concluded there is some relationship between juvenile delinquency
and adult crime. But many adults who become criminals have no police records as
youths, and many juveniles with five or more police contacts become law-abiding
citizens, the study said.

It was financed with grants from the Justice Department, the Fleischman
Foundation and the University of Iowa.  ''Much of the concern about juvenile
delinquency has been based on the premise that it leads to adult crime,'' said
the director of the study, Lyle Shannon, head of the Iowa Urban Community
Research Center at the University of Iowa.

Some Relationship

Although studies have shown some relationship between adult criminals and
juvenile delinquency, Shannon said such relationship ''is not sufficient to
permit prediction from juvenile misbehavior of who will become adult
criminals.''

If there is a relationship, Shannon said it may be explained by the ''operation
of the juvenile and adult justice systems as well as by continuities in the
behavior of juveniles.''

Law-abiding adults who had been juvenile delinquents said they changed their
behavior after realizing that what they thought was fun as a juvenile ''was no
longer appropriate behavior as an adult'' - not out of fear of being arrested,
the study said.

It said imposing sanctions on juvenile delinquents and the intervention of
social workers and social programs is frequently ineffective in deterring
teen-agers who misbehave.

''With considerable regularity,'' the study said, ''male juveniles increased the
frequency and seriousness of their misbehavior immediately after sanctions were
imposed against them. The increase in seriousness of misbehavior was not true
for female juveniles.''

Shannon said the study showed delinquent behavior generally declined in
seriousness and discontinued after the teen-age years.  ''The few who continue
to have police contacts with an increase in seriousness (and finally a decline)
are those who become well known to the adult justice system and thus create the
impression of continuity and increasing seriousness in delinquent criminal
careers,'' he said.

''It is this relatively small 'hard core' continuers on whom attention should be
focused by the juvenile and adult justice systems,'' he said.

Inner City Connection

The study found that only those studied in the inner city of Racine showed any
evidence of a connection between juvenile and adult behavior.

Of the group born in 1942, he said, 11.7 percent lived in the inner city and had
continuous policy contacts up to age 18. More than 53 percent of those had
''high seriousness scores'' as adults, he said.

The study focused on the delinquency and criminal careers of three groups of
people. One group was born in 1942 and their contacts with police were traced
from age 6 to 32. A second group, born in 1949, and their police contacts were
traced from age 6 to 25. The third group was born in 1949 and traced from age 6
to 21.

Experian/Moody's Analytics' Report Shows Small-Business Credit Quality Continued
to Improve in Q2, Lifting Index to Highest Point on Record

LENGTH: 389  words


New Delhi, Aug. 27 -- Experian, the leading global information services company,
today announced that small-business credit conditions strengthened in the second
quarter of this year, lifting the Experian/Moody's Analytics Small Business
Credit Index to 111.7 - the highest level since it began tracking in 2010.
According to the latest report, consumer confidence is high and small-business
credit quality has shown improvements throughout the quarter due to personal
income growth, retail sales increases and steady employment gains.



"The economy has held up better than anticipated so far this year in the face of
large tax increases and government spending cuts, which has supported improved
small-business borrowing and credit quality," said Mark Zandi, chief economist
at Moody's Analytics. "While there remain several hurdles to even better
conditions, including the coming political battles over the Treasury debt
ceiling and federal government funding and the prospects for higher interest
rates, small businesses should get over these hurdles reasonably well."

Findings from the report showed that small firms have steadily reduced their
delinquent debt over the past year. Balance volumes for all business sizes
receded measurably from a year earlier, bringing down delinquency rates.
Further, credit quality has strengthened for every business size. At an average
of 10.2 percent, the total share of delinquent dollars is 2.4 percentage points
lower than it was a year ago and is at the lowest point on record.

"During this period of modest growth, small businesses have improved their
credit profile by decreasing delinquent debt and meeting financial obligations
in a more timely fashion," said Joel Pruis, Experian's senior business
consultant. "Businesses of all sizes need to maintain a strong credit profile,
as it enables them to more easily secure the credit or funding they need to grow
their enterprise."

Regionally, the report showed that delinquency rates were significantly lower
than the national average for small companies in Idaho, Wyoming, Arizona and
Utah. Additionally, large Western cities, including Phoenix, Ariz.; Houston,
Texas; San Francisco, Calif.; Las Vegas, Nev.; San Diego, Calif.; and Salt Lake
City, Utah, were all in the top 10th percentile among metro areas for
small-business credit quality.

Lawton denies double-counted tax claim

BYLINE: Michael P. Buffer, The Citizens' Voice, Wilkes-Barre, Pa.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 345 words


Oct. 24--WRIGHT TWP. -- Luzerne County Manager Robert Lawton is denying a claim
that delinquent-tax revenue is double-counted in his proposed 2013 budget.

John Rodgers, an executive in charge of back-tax collection, said Monday the
$122.2 million budget double-counts overdue tax income. The $8 million estimate
in delinquent-tax revenue for 2013 is inflated by more than $3 million because
the budget includes other revenue from selling delinquent 2011 tax liens, said
Rodgers, president of Northeast Revenue Service LLC.

But in an email to county council members, Lawton said the $8 million estimate
does not include delinquent 2011 tax payments. He said it includes:

> $6 million from delinquent 2012 taxes payments.

> $2 million in 2012 tax payments collected prior to the end of 2012 but
received by the county in the first two months of 2013.

Selling delinquent 2011 tax liens this year will generate $5.5 million, and that
will help create $4.35 million in year-end surplus funds to carry over as
revenue in 2013, Lawton said. The process allows a third party to buy delinquent
tax liens from the county for about 90 to 95 percent of what is owed. The county
would receive an up-front influx of cash, instead of waiting for overdue tax
payments from property owners.

Northeast Revenue has been collecting overdue taxes for the county since 2010.
Budget crunches have forced the county to sell delinquent tax liens every year
from 2008 to 2011.

County council must adopt a final budget between Nov. 15 and Dec. 15. Council
will hold a budget hearing next week.

During Tuesday's council meeting in Wright Township, Councilman Rick Morelli
suggested having at least one more hearing. Morelli also suggested that council
Chairman Tim McGinley and Lawton decide which officials and office heads will be
present to answer questions from council members during next week's hearing.

New deposit on past-due

BYLINE: News Letter Journal staff

LENGTH: 677  words


After holding several discussions on the topic, the Newcastle City Council has
decided that the present amount of deposits are currently insufficient to cover
delinquent accounts, and it is likely that at some point the city may need a new
ordinance to raise that amount.

"We are not recommending an ordinance right now," Mayor Greg James said at the
council's

Feb. 19 meeting.

The council did meet as a Committee of the Whole a week prior to the regularly
scheduled council meeting to discuss the problem presented by a growing number
of delinquent city utility accounts. A number of proposed solutions were
discussed, and Monday night James reported those solutions most favored by the
council at their regularly scheduled meeting.

The action the council may take would require that individuals whose accounts
became delinquent would have to pay a new deposit to get service reconnected.

"The recommendations "coming from that meeting would be if anyone, from that
time that we may change the ordinance going forward, would become delinquent, if
there's no deposit on hand, they would be required to make a new deposit," James
explained.

He also indicated that if the council does feel that a change in ordinance to
raise the amount of deposits becomes necessary, those people who became
delinquent, but did have a deposit in the city office, would have to pay
additional money to bring the amount of deposit to the new level before service
was reconnected.

Additionally, James indicated that accounts that became delinquent yvould not
have their deposits refunded until the time ' when their service was terminated,
t "Right now. for accounts in good standing, we refund that in one year. To get
on the delinquent list would be no refund until their water service with
Newcastle is terminated,"

James explained.

He also pointed out that those individuals who pay their bills on time would see
no change in their current service, billing, or refund status.

"It would have no bearing whatsoever on those who do not become delinquent. It
would not change the refund amount. It would not change the time we hold the
deposit currently. It would have an affect only on those who become delinquent
with their water bills to the city," James professed.

The mayor's report came as a result of a Committee of the Whole meeting held
Feb. 11 to discuss issues related to delinquent accounts. The meeting was
scheduled after the council shelved a proposal to increase the amount of time
that deposits would be held for city utilities, in an effort to reduce the
number of delinquent accounts.

"What we're really after then is protecting our public funds. That's what's
really driving this discussion," James said at the start of the Committee of the
Whole meeting.

There was concern expressed by some on the council regarding whether the problem
is serious enough to justify a change, but city employees were able to
demonstrate that the number of delinquencies is increasing.

Deputy City Clerk/Treasurer Deb Mills showed the council a spreadsheet that
indicated the city had 36 delinquent accounts in January of 2012, and the number
in January of this year was 40.

"In January of last year, the delinquents, most of them, weren't above $100. In
January of this year, a good percentage of them are over $100, so the deposits
aren't covering what the delinquents bill is, in a two-month period," Mills
demonstrated.

Once an account has become delinquent, city utility customers have a set amount
of time to pay the bill before the water service is disconnected.

"You have two unpaid bills that you're holding, and you're preparing to get
billed for the third month," James observed.

"When the bill is unpaid for 45 days, then we send the delinquent notice," Mills
explained further.

Although customers have to presently pay a reconnect fee once that occurs, they
don't have to pay a new deposit. Under the proposal put forward by James on Feb.
19, that situ'-ation would change, and those individuals would have to pay a new
deposit that would then not be returned until the service is terminated.

Tax;
Businesses, corporations and individuals on delinquent list

ABSTRACT

Findings from the list of delinquent taxpayers in New Hanover County.

FULL TEXT

NEW HANOVER COUNTY   Nearly $4 million in 2015 property taxes is owed to New
Hanover County as of March 21, according to an annual report released by the
county tax department.

Businesses, corporations, dissolved entities and homeowners are among the 3,635
property owners who owe $3.89 million on parcels in the county. The balances
range from just over $53,000 to $5.82.

The county s tax collection rate was 98.8 percent last year, said county Tax
Administrator Roger Kelley. Property tax bills became delinquent on Jan. 6,
after which time property owners receive two notices.

Wilmington Mayor Bill Saffo s name was on the list for $1,788.96   taxes
connected to a lot in an industrial park off North Kerr Ave he formerly owned
along with several family members.

Saffo said the land had been under contract and was set to close last year, but
the closing was delayed until this month. The taxes were paid Monday by a law
firm, according to county records.

It should have been paid at the time it was due,  said the mayor, who said he
did not know of the overdue taxes until he was contacted by the StarNews on

SEE Tax,  A8

Thursday.

Obviously you want to pay your taxes,  Saffo said.  That s part of living in the
city and living in a great county like ours.

Payment plan

This is the second year in a row that the county s delinquency list has
dwindled. At this time last year, New Hanover was owed $4 million on about 4,200
parcels. In 2014, the county was owed $5.7 million on 4,952 parcels.

Kelley attributes the diminished number of delinquent taxpayers to increased
enrollment in the tax office s coupon program that began in September 2014.

The program allows property owners to pay their taxes in four installments
leading up to the due date. Previously, payment plans were only offered once an
account became delinquent.

There are a lot of people using them, even some businesses,  Kelley said.  A lot
of residents never knew they didn t have to pay it all at once, especially
senior citizens.

Kelly said the county is required by law to run the names of delinquent
taxpayers in print; the list will appear in Sunday s StarNews. But he said the
public tactic doesn t have the same effect it used to.

It used to be embarrassing for people to see their name in the paper, but now
they don t seem to care,  he said.

From high to low

Interest accrues monthly on unpaid property taxes at a rate of 2 percent for
January and 0.75 percent each month after that, Kelley said.

Joyner Marina LLC sits atop this year s list, owing $59,442.19 on two parcels.
Last year, Joyner came in second with $56,793.26 owed on the same two parcels.
Multiple calls to Joyner Marina this week were not returned.

Raleigh-based Foreverhome LLC, which also operated locally under the name
Foreverhome of Wilmington, claims 24 parcels on the list, totaling $53,628.44 in
uncollected taxes. This comes after news broke last summer of the company s
cash flow problems.  At the time, co-founder Mark Ward said the setback was
temporary. The homebuilder had ongoing projects in Wilmington, Middle Sound,
Porters Neck, Castle Hayne and Landfall.

The company could not be reached for comment Thursday. Foreverhome owned 27
properties on last year s list with unpaid taxes totaling $37,277.83.

New Hanover Health Investors LLC, which has been dissolved, owes the county
$43,144.42 on one parcel at 3915 Stedwick Court.

City Marina Wilmington LLC, also dissolved, owes $34,301.48.

Astor Holdings LLC, which was dissolved in 2009, still owes the county
$27,141.63 in outstanding taxes on four parcels.

But not everyone owes thousands of dollars to the county   249 taxpayers owe
less than $20.

Kelley said he understands that some of the uncollected taxes are from people
still climbing their way out of a struggling economy.

We ve still got a lot of unemployed residents out there trying to get caught up,
he said.

More than $300K paid in delinquent property taxes this week

BYLINE: Michael P. Buffer, The Citizens' Voice, Wilkes-Barre, Pa.

Aug. 05--WILKES-BARRE -- Two prominent businessmen in Luzerne County paid more
than $300,000 combined toward delinquent property tax bills this week, according
to the company in charge of Luzerne County's tax claim office.

Wilkes-Barre businessman Thom Greco paid more than $108,000 in delinquent
property taxes, and Hazleton area businessman James Lagana paid more than
$217,000, according to Northeast Revenue Service.

Because of the payments, Greco's properties will be excluded from the Sept. 29
sale of properties with delinquent taxes from 2008 or prior years, said Sean
Shamany, the office manager with Northeast Revenue Service LLC. Greco's
properties still have delinquent taxes from 2009 that exceed $103,000, records
show.

Greco, a developer and restaurateur who pleaded guilty last month to failing to
report a felony, said he helped a Luzerne County official purchase and install
flat-panel televisions in 2005 and never received reimbursement for the cost of
the sets, said to be more than $10,000.

The official, identified by sources familiar with an ongoing corruption
investigation as former Luzerne County Commissioner Greg Skrepenak, considered
the televisions a reward for supporting a county authority's $5.8 million
purchase of a Greco-owned train station property on Market Street in
Wilkes-Barre, federal prosecutors said.

Greco this week paid delinquent school, municipal and county taxes on six
properties in Wilkes-Barre, said Shamany. Lagana paid taxes on four properties
in Hazle Township, which include the Beltway Commons and Laurel Professional
Center, Shamany said.

Lagana still has to pay about nearly $22,000 in delinquent 2008 taxes to get his
properties excluded from the Sept. 29 tax sale, Shamany said. Last week, Lagana,
owner and operator of Holly Lynn Trailer Park in Hazle Township, a 49-unit
development along Airport Beltway, had a delinquent tax bill that exceeded
$274,000.

The county hired the Wilkes-Barre-based Northeast Revenue Service to run its tax
claim office in May. Last year, federal authorities seized tax claim records to
probe for irregularities and preferential treatment.

Sterlent Credit losses mount

BYLINE: By George Avalos staff writer

SECTION: BUSINESS

LENGTH: 618 words


PLEASANTON -- Red ink mounted at Sterlent Credit Union during the first three
months of 2008, and the credit union said it is working with a possible partner
to help address its financial woes.

The credit union lost $5.5 million during the January-March period. The losses
for those three months alone exceeded the $4.8 million Sterlent lost during all
of 2007, according to a quarterly report the company has filed.

The most recent difficulties underscore how the morass in housing and the
mortgage industry has engulfed a wider array of financial institutions.

In recent years, Sterlent embarked on a program to sell home equity lines of
credit to its members. But the crash in residential real estate caused many of
those loans to fail.

"Like many other financial institutions in similar situations regarding
delinquent loans secured by real property, we continue to work with these member
borrowers and under full guidance of our regulators," Sue Raines, president and
chief executive of Sterlent, said in an e-mail response to questions from this
newspaper.

Pleasanton-based Sterlent reported that it had $3.1 million in delinquent loans
at the end of March. About $2.9 million of those delinquent notes were
adjustable rate real estate loans, according to the quarterly filing.

Those numbers represented an improvement from the end of 2007, when Sterlent
reported it had $4.8 million in delinquent loans of all types on its books.

Although Sterlent executives would not provide details, the company indicated it
is looking to an outside organization that could help stabilize its balance
sheet.

"We are in the process of working with a potential partner that will provide
positive long-term solutions to these issues," Raines said. Sterlent has
branches in Pleasanton, Castro Valley and Sacramento.

Sterlent's problems represent the second time that significant losses have
struck an East Bay credit union in 2007.

Concord-based Cal State 9 suffered steadily increasing levels of red ink and was
forced into a state conservatorship in November. Cal State 9 also said a program
of home-equity loans burdened it with losses.

Still, these problems are more likely isolated incidents rather than a warning
that credit unions generally are in financial disarray, according to officials
with the California Credit Union League.

"We feel the credit union industry remains very healthy in California," said
Chris Collver, a regulatory and legislative analyst with the league. "But
obviously, the housing market is impacting the industry."

Case in point: Credit unions in 2007 reported that 0.85 percent of their total
loans were delinquent. That was up from a delinquency rate in 2006 of 0.47
percent, according to the league. Typically, regulators believe that a
delinquency rate below 1.5 percent is relatively healthy.

California credit unions have offered home equity lines of credit and subprime
loans of the type that have contributed to the mortgage mess. But Terrin
Griffiths, an economist and analyst with the league said she believes California
credit unions have for the most part used conservative standards for issuing
realty mortgages.

"Credit unions in general have always underwritten these loans very prudently,"
Griffiths said. "They don't engage in the lending practices that we have seen
outside of the regulated part of the industry."

Despite the problems at Sterlent, the company's top priority is its members,
according to the credit union.

"We continue to focus on meeting the needs of our members each and every day,
without fail," Raines said.

Supplementary Information

The Railroad Retirement Board (Board) proposes to amend part 367 of the Board's
regulations, Recovery of Debts Owed to the United States Government by

120 days the debts referred to the Department of the Treasury in compliance with
the DATA Act.

The Board, with the concurrence of the Office of Management and Budget, has
determined that this is not a significant regulatory action under Executive
Order 12866, as amended. Therefore, no regulatory impact analysis is required.
There are no changes to the information collections associated with Part 367.

Texas man pays $465 for kids with delinquent lunch accounts

BYLINE: Peter Samore Deseret News

LENGTH: 201 words


HOUSTON -- Motivated by reports of Salt Lake City's Uintah Elementary School
tossing out students' lunches because of delinquencies on their account, a
Houston man wanted to make sure nothing like that would happen in his neck of
the woods.

Kenny Thompson, a mentor and volunteer at Valley Oaks Elementary School,
discovered about 60 children at that school had delinquent accounts and received
cold cheese sandwiches instead of a full tray of food for lunch. So, he pulled
$465 out of his pocket to change that.

"I thought that it would be better just to come in and zero out the balances,
start from a clean slate, and no one would have to worry about any account
balances," he said. "The kids would eat every day, and that's what I did."

He had heard of the incident at the Salt Lake school where adults threw out the
lunches of kids who had delinquent accounts. He said just because the parents
are late doesn't mean the children shouldn't eat.

"The one meal we can control in school is lunch," he said. "These are elementary
school kids. They don't need to be worried about finances. They need to be
worried about what grade they got in spelling."

Thompson called it the best money he ever spent.

Speedier Collection Sought

In a move aimed at speeding up delinquent property tax collection, Cook County
Treasurer Maria Pappas' office last week launched an online version of its
annual tax sale.

Replacing the annual live auction with an online version cuts to four from 20
the number of days it takes to collect bids and payments and ready the funds for
distribution, officials said last week when the annual sale was held.

The new technology also offers more transparency to those vying to buy the back
taxes and ensures that winning bids are randomly chosen, said Patrick Nester,
assistant chief financial officer for the treasurer's office. The online auction
replaces the county's long-time tradition of holding live annual auctions where
bidders would yell bids to an auctioneer. "Our purpose is to collect the
property taxes and distribute them more quickly to the 1,600 governmental
units," throughout the county, Nester said.

About 165 bidders registered online this year to bid on 53,000 properties that
had a total of $155 million in unpaid taxes. Cook County includes roughly 1.8
million properties.

Prior to its annual sale, the county publishes delinquent taxes in an effort to
get late homeowners to pay overdue taxes. The remaining unpaid bills are
auctioned off to bidders who purchase the delinquent taxes, giving them control
of the property through a tax lien as well as the right to demand a certain
percentage return on top of the tax bill from the homeowner looking to buy back
the taxes in the future.

Replacing the live auction with a four-day online process makes the sale faster,
easier, and more fair than when an auctioneer selected the winning bid among a
group of bidders offering the same bid, Nester said.

IOWA

University Weathers Storms

Standard & Poor's last week said Iowa State University's credit would not suffer
due to the devastating floods that hit the Midwest in June even as the
university has reported preliminary costs of $232 million associated with
flood-related repairs.

The university saw about 14 of its buildings on its campus in Ames seriously
affected by the flooding, including utility tunnels nearest to the Iowa River
which overtook its banks. The damaged dormitories are being repaired and should
be ready for the fall semester. As other buildings are repaired, such as the
Arts Complex, temporary space is being provided. The university did cancel some
summer classes in the arts and music programs.

While the costs are not yet final, the university expects to fund them through a
mix of insurance proceeds, federal reimbursements, possible state assistance,
and internal funds.

"At this time, university officials estimate that the net cost to the university
could range from $25 million to $60 million. Given the tentative nature of these
estimates, and the university's overall financial resources and fundraising
capacity, we expect these costs will be manageable," analysts wrote.

The university expects enrollment to be similar to last year. The extensive
University Hospital was not damaged, analysts wrote. The university's unlimited
student fee bonds are rated AA, the same as its hospital revenue bonds. Its
dormitory revenue bonds are rated A-plus, its parking revenue bonds A and
athletic facilities revenue bonds are AA-minus.

ISU is one of three public universities in Iowa and is the state's flagship
academic, research, and health care institution. The fall 2007 enrollment of
30,409 was up 2.2% from fall 2005. Outstanding debt is about $745 million,
including $72.6 million of hospital revenue bonds.

MISSOURI

Light Rail on K.C. Ballot

The Kansas City council last week decided to ask voters on the Nov. 4 general
election ballot whether they support a sales tax increase to fund an $800
million starter light-rail system.

The 14-mile line would be funded with proceeds of a three-eighths percent
increase in the sales tax for 25 years. The plan relies on about half of the
funding coming from the federal government.

Over the last several years, the city has debated the light-rail issue but
failed to reach agreement on one specific plan, arguing over the size of the
system and its routes.

The council last year overturned a proposal from private businessman Clay
Chastain that was endorsed by voters in 2006. The latest proposal comes from the
Kansas City Area Transportation Authority.

Kansas City Mayor Mark Funkhouser this spring presented a larger $1.2 billion
plan regional transit plan that relies on a sales tax increase for funding.

WISCONSIN

Tobacco Advisers Sought

Financial advisers interested in advising Wisconsin on its proposed
restructuring of its $1.6 billion tobacco securitization from 2002 have until
Wednesday, Aug. 27, to submit their proposals to the state's capital finance
office. About $1.4 billion is still outstanding.

In the coming weeks, the state will launch a request for proposals for
underwriters. The financial advisory firm or firms selected will help the state
pick an underwriting team and craft a transaction. The state had previously
named a team but dramatic industry changes prompted the need for a revised team,
said capital finance director Frank Hoadley.

Bear, Stearns & Co. was to be the book-runner, but it has since been acquired by
JPMorgan. UBS Securities LLC was also on the team but it has exited the
municipal market. First Albany Capital Inc. was to be the financial adviser but
it has since evolved into Depfa First Albany Securities LLC and its stronger
capital base puts it in the position to vie for a role on the underwriting team.
Several key tobacco bankers have also moved to other firms.

The state included in its current budget the restructuring plan, but the deal
had been on hold last year due to increased interest rates. The bonds are repaid
with Wisconsin's share of payments under the 1998 national settlement between
most states and the major tobacco companies. Under a revised plan, the state
will put an annual appropriation behind the restructured bonds, which it expects
will lower the interest rates on the debt and help kick-start the deal.

In addition to about $150 million in up-front savings earmarked to cover part of
a budget deficit, officials also expect to generate at least $50 million in
annual savings to establish an endowment to support health care and antismoking
programs.

Airport Lease to Be Studied

Milwaukee County Executive Scott Walker is expected to propose in his 2009
budget to be released next month that the county fund a study on the
privatization of Mitchell International Airport.

Walker has floated the idea that he says could raise $1 billion. The idea has
not generated much support among county board members and some have raised
questions over its viability given the struggles of the airline industry,
including high fuel costs.

Walker said in published reports he might seek funding for a consultants' study
that would be funded with airport revenues. Walker recently talked with Chicago
officials who are currently reviewing the qualifications of teams interested in
bidding on the right to operate Midway Airport under a long-term lease for an
up-front payment that some have said could raise $3 billion. Chicago would use
the funds to shore up its pensions and fund infrastructure projects.

Walker has said he would use funds from a lease for transit, offsetting the need
for a sales tax increase that some are pushing. The county board has approved
placing on the November ballot a referendum seeking a 1% increase in the sales
tax but Walker vetoed it. The board will attempt an override at a meeting on
Sept. 4.

Billing change making difference with delinquent garbage bills

BYLINE: Kevin Flowers, Erie Times-News, Pa.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 556 words


Aug. 30--ERIE, Pa. -- When Erie Mayor Joe Sinnott announced details of the
city's midyear financial report on Aug. 5, he mentioned some unexpected good
news related to the push to collect more than $2 million in overdue garbage
bills.

Sinnott said the city expects to see a $384,000 surplus in its refuse and
recycling fund by the end of 2015, in large part because of
better-than-anticipated collections of penalties and late fees related to
delinquent bills.

That windfall wasn't a big surprise at City Hall.

City and Erie Water Works officials, who have been working together since early
2014 to reduce garbage delinquencies, introduced revamped billing procedures in
late 2014 to improve collections. Erie Water Works handles garbage and sewer
billing for the city as well as billing for water use.

The billing change now allows Erie Water Works to legally shut off a customer's
water service in relation to a delinquent refuse account -- and that has
prompted more than 3,700 customers to enter into payment plans with the utility
since November to pay those bills off.

Paul Vojtek, Erie Water Works' chief executive, said those payment arrangements
have brought in nearly $850,000 in overdue refuse fees since Nov. 1. That means
that nearly 53 percent of the utility's roughly 7,000 delinquent customers are
now on a payment plan.

"We've had almost 600 customers who have paid more than $500 each on a payment
arrangement, for example," Vojtek said.

"Just those customers are responsible for paying almost $500,000," he said.

"That's incredible, I think."

Vojtek said that Erie Water Works structures payment arrangements of between
three months and a year, depending on the amount a customer owes on his or her
garbage bill.

Erie Water Works sent a letter to all of its 34,600 city of Erie customers in
October informing them of the billing change.

The utility used to bill garbage separately and combined water and sewer bills.

However, Erie Water Works and city officials decided to change that structure in
2014 and combine garbage and sewer bills.

In May 2014, Erie City Council passed a resolution requiring that partial
payments on bills go toward any garbage delinquencies before the sewer account,
which means that if the sewer account then becomes delinquent, Erie Water Works
can legally shut off water service.

"It's played a role in our increased collections, so I think it's been a
positive change on the overall system," Sinnott said. "And we're hoping that
will continue to see that, until delinquencies are to a point where they're
almost nonexistent."

City Finance Director Paul Lichtenwalter said it will likely take up to two
years to see that happen, because delinquent customers have new, current charges
added to their bills every three months.

"But it's definitely been a good thing," Lichtenwalter said.

"The change in billing might have been a little bit of a culture shock to some
people, but people are getting used to it. And people can't think this money is
going to show up right away. It's going to take some time. ... By the end of
2016, everybody should be up to date."

FORECLOSURE ON SEWER TAX DELINQUENTS

Suit is being commenced this week by the Town of Farmington to foreclose all
delinquent sewer assessments in the Sewer District in the Town of Farmington.

The Board of Trustees points out there are three main purposes for bring the
suit at this time.

First: There are outstanding and unpaid thirty six of the sewer certificates, of
the aggregate principal amount of $15,500.00. ...

Second: There is always the danger that unless the municipality takes proper
steps to collect the delinquent assessments, the certificate holders may join
together and take the matter into Federal Court to force collection. ...

Third: By commencing the foreclosure proceedings, the Town can place itself in
the position wherein it can force the collections of the assessments and at the
same time make it possible for the property owners who are delinquent in their
payments to pay their delinquent assessments in installments, thereby saving
their land from sale under foreclosure.

County treasurer monitoring investment fund

BYLINE: Dianne Stallings dstallings@ruidosonews.com

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 918 words


Lincoln County's treasurer says she won't rest until she sees every cent of the
county's money returned from The Reserve Primary Fund.

When Lehman Brothers collapsed in September 2008, the Fund was heavily invested
there, and the state investment pool was invested in the Fund.

Although County Treasurer Beverly Calaway managed to pull out most of the county
money from the pool, a percentage was held against future losses from those
investments. A federal district court ordered The Reserve Primary Fund to
distribute the money it was holding.

"On Jan. 1, 2010, the Reserve Primary Fund announced it would make another
distribution order-ed by the U.S. District Court of New York, the sixth to
Primary Fund shareholders, but they still are holding $160 million to cover
contingency expenses," she said.

The last distribution to the county Jan. 29 was for $69,960,96 and was
de-posited in the State Treasurer's local investment pool. She withdrew the
money and deposited it in a bank account that was collateralized at 102 percent.

"Even then, $17,347 is being held," Calaway said. "That's not bad after what
happened to investors two years ago , but I'm not standing up and applauding
anyone yet. This is public money and 100 percent should be released."

She asked county commissioners at their meeting last week to direct County
Manager Tom Stewart or County Attorney Alan Morel to write the New Mexico state
treasurer and attorney general requesting continued legal action against the
reserve fund until all the money is returned.

"I can handle that," Stewart said.

"I think we need to," said Vice Chairman Eileen Sedillo, sitting in for absent
chairman Tom Battin..

"I won't rest until we get every cent back," Calaway said. "This is public money
and they have no legal basis to hold it for their contingency, because of their
wrong doing."

The sixth distribution of $3.4 billion, represents about 95 percent of the
Fund's remaining asset value of $3.56 billion. Including the sixth distribution,
$50.5 billion or about 99 percent of Fund assets as of the close of business
Sept. 15, 2008, will have been returned to investors, according to information
from the Reserve Primary Fund.

The money being held and not invested affects the interest earned by the county,
she said.

"They (the State Treasurer's Office) are pretty secretive about the
distributions, which I don't understand why they are not more open about giving
us information," Calaway said. "I watch the Web site and that's where I first
read about it."

Commissioner Dave Parks said a few years ago, "The state treasurer was telling
everybody that was safe money and not to worry."

Calaway said the state Transportation Department invested in the pool .
Officials there received no information from the state treasurer and, "had no
idea they had a loss. I'm been very disappointed with the communication."

Parks said the Santa Fe officials invested money in the pool and were waiting
for the results of a trial. "When they were ready to disperse it, it wasn't
there," he said.

Moving to her financial report for commissioners sitting as the Board of
Finance, Calaway said for financial statements ending Jan. 31, 2010, the seven
month mark, the county has received 62 percent of the budgeted revenues for the
2009-2010 fiscal year, which ends June 30.

"Our current property tax collection is at 74 percent, delinquent property tax
at 101 percent and interest earned on investments at 42 percent," she said.

The average interest rates on county investments in January were 1.22 percent on
certificates of deposits and debt reserve and .50 percent on money market and
the operational account.

Cash held by the treasurer's office was $16,144,217.98 compared to
$14,718,577.52 in January 2009, Calaway said.

As of Jan. 31, she collected 64.37 percent of the #22.9 million billed for 2009
property tax.

"The New Mexico Delinquent Property Tax Division's title examiner, Sherry Hayne,
is in Lincoln County researching our delinquent properties," Calaway said. "Our
delinquent list for 2006, 2007 and 2008 began with 127 accounts.

Our list now is down to 31, with $200,569.52 being collected on the delinquent
tax list.

"The Delinquent Proper-ty Tax Bureau's research and the threat of delinquent
properties being advertised in local papers, is instrumental in our excellent
record of collections in Lincoln County."

As of Jan. 31, her office collected 99 percent of delinquent properties from
2002 to 2007.

Commissioner Jackie Powell congratulated Calaway on the high percentage of
delinquent tax collection in the county. Parks said one of the highest in the
state.

Calaway said part of the job is ensuring mobile homes that move out of the
county are removed from the tax rolls.

"We always have a lot of interest in Lincoln County (for annual delinquent
property tax sales)," Calaway said. "They think it is a beautiful resort area
and they want to pick it property for nothing. My job is to ensure the taxes are
collected before the sale."

In tracking the county-enacted one-eight of a 1 percent gross receipt tax for
indigent health care and the county detention center over the past few fiscal
years, she noted a 12.97 percent decrease in the last six months of FY2009-2010.

"We will carefully watch these funds and report the information to Mr.
Stew-art," she said.

Stewart told commissioners, "It's great working with Beverly. We are always
conservative with our revenue projections and on the safe side with
expenditures, so there are no surprises."

Washington: Freddie Mac Announces First NPL Sale to Non-Profit Buyer

LENGTH: 256  words

DATELINE: Lahore



 Washington: Nation's Residential Mortgage Markets has issued the following news
release:



 Freddie Mac (OTCQB: FMCC) today announced it sold via auction 103 deeply
delinquent non-performing loans (NPLs) serviced by Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., from
its mortgage investment portfolio on December 18, 2015. The winning bidder of

Pool Offerings (EXPO®). In March 2015, Freddie Mac's regulator, the Federal
Housing Finance Agency, announced enhanced requirements [pdf] for NPL sales.





 These loans have been delinquent for approximately three years, on average.
Given the deep delinquency status of the loans, the borrowers have likely been
evaluated previously for, or are already in various stages of, loss mitigation,
including modification or other alternatives to foreclosure, or are in
foreclosure. Mortgages that were previously modified and subsequently became
delinquent comprise approximately 43 percent of the aggregate pool balance. The
aggregate pool is geographically concentrated in Miami-Dade and Tampa, FL, and
has a loan-to-value ratio of approximately 88 percent, based on BPO (Broker
Price Opinion).

Land bank won't ask for bigger cut of delinquent taxes for now

BYLINE: Denise G. Callahan, Journal-News, Hamilton, Ohio

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 683 words


Sept. 02--BUTLER COUNTY -- Members of the Butler County Land Bank agreed this
week that it's too soon to bump up the percentage of delinquent tax money being
funneled into the blight-eliminating program, despite growing interest from
local communities.

Board member Dan Acton raised the prospect of doubling the percentage of
delinquent taxes that currently come into the program from 1 percent to 2
percent.

Butler County commissioners agreed last summer to take 1 percent of delinquent
tax and assessment collection funds (DTAC) to bolster the land bank and open up
services for the entire county. DTAC funds are late payment penalties on real
estate taxes. The blight eradication agency is expected to collect about
$155,000 from it's first annual installment of DTAC funds.

Acton asked if they shouldn't explore asking the commissioners to raise the
percentage given the growing number of jurisdictions -- Fairfield, Hanover,
Liberty and Ross townships and the city of Trenton -- that have joined since the
the economic development tool was opened up countywide.

"Perhaps down the road with the other participating communities, not to take it
up to the five, but see how this goes, obviously the interest and the need is
there," Acton said. "It doesn't appear as though any more large chunks (of
funding) are coming in anytime soon, so perhaps we should have that chat at some
point, about going up just a little bit, maybe to two (percent)."

County Treasurer Nancy Nix, who chairs the land bank board, said Butler County
is one of few, if the not the only land bank to only take 1 percent, the rest in
the state get 5 percent. A jump to 5 percent would garner about $775,584, and 2
percent would just about double current DTAC revenues.

Up until now the county's two largest cities have been the sole beneficiaries of
$4.6 million in outside funding, but Hamilton and Middletown also chipped in
$1.2 million apiece in matching money to get the $2.6 million Moving Ohio
Forward funds. The land bank just recently awarded DTAC funds to Ross Twp. for
up to $5,000 to demolish a building and up to $16,000 to Hamilton to take down a
ramshackle house that is sandwiched between two commercial buildings on Main
Street.

Executive Director Mike McNamara recommended the board wait on asking for more
money until it sees the results of a Miami University study being conducted on
the land bank program to date.

"It might give us an idea how successful we've been, and what we could do with
increased funding," he said.

Middletown City Manager Doug Adkins also urged patience.

"I think there is an advantage to running where we're at just for the short term
and showing some more successes just at the one percent," Adkins said. "The time
I think to make that ask is when the one percent is tapped, and we still have
more need and requests we can't fulfill."

Nix said depending on when they might ask and the commissioners might grant an
increase, there could be about a year delay before they would receive new
funding.

County Administrator Charlie Young said the commissioners are always keeping "a
close eye" on the land bank because their foremost concern is whether the
expenditure benefits the taxpayers.

"It's got to prove that it's worth the investment," Young said.

The entity most impacted by the diverted DTAC funds are the Lakota Schools. They
took a $28,000 hit with the 1 percent, and a 2-percent hike would take their
revenue reduction to almost $56,000. The statewide norm of five percent would
suck almost $140,000 out of Lakota's budget.

Lakota spokesman Randy Oppenheimer said there is more than one way of looking at
the diverted funds.

"The amount of money is what the amount of money is, if it's another $28,000
that's $28,000," he said. "We understand that the county commissioners are
trying to support needs throughout the county, and often times those needs
benefit the schools in another way. Good economic development is good for
schools."

Pennsylvania State Legislature Memoranda: Slot Machine and Table Game Winnings
Intercept Legislation

LENGTH: 186  words

DATELINE: Harrisburg


Pennsylvania State Legislature has issued the following Memoranda updates:

In the near future, I plan to introduce legislation that will amend Title 23
(Domestic Relations) to require the intercept of slot machine and table game
winnings to pay for delinquent child support.

Specifically, my bill requires that upon completion of the federal W-2G (Certain
Gambling Winnings) by a patron whose winnings exceed $1,200, a casino must
supply the patron's identifying information to the Department of Human Services
(DHS).  Using the provided information, DHS is required to determine whether a
slot machine or table games winner is a delinquent support obligor prior to
making any winnings payment. If the winner is delinquent, the amount of any debt
will be deducted from the winnings and paid to the obligee. Additionally, my
legislation permits DHS to establish a fee to be paid by delinquent patrons in
order for both the department and the casino to recoup costs associated with the
winnings intercept.

Collecting payments becomes big business

BYLINE: Lisa Faye Kaplan

SECTION: MONEY; Pg. 6B

LENGTH: 999 words


Bill collectors rarely claim to be white knights. But a new crop of collectors,
who pursue scofflaw dads and delinquent child-support payments, are casting
themselves as Robin Hoods who protect and defend women and children.

''We take from the deadbeats and give to their families,'' says Dennis Cohen, a
Los Angeles lawyer whose agency goes after debtor dads and collects something
70% of the time. ''Robin Hood helps people who are getting a bad deal. ... We've
got the sheriff on our side this time.''

Not everyone thinks those bounty hunters are heroes.

''They're vultures ... preying on desperate people,'' says Geraldine Jensen,
president of the Association for Children for Enforcement of Support, a national
self-help group for custodial parents.

In 1990, absent parents had fallen $ 24 billion behind in child-support
payments. Government agencies were able to retrieve only 25% of that debt: $ 18
billion went uncollected. Fed up with waiting for support checks that never
come, some custodial parents are turning to the private sector for help.

Realizing a lucrative market, a growing number of collection agencies are mining
that mountain of debt and charging a fee of between 15% and 33% of the back
payments they collect.

Find Dad, a Fairfax, Va.-based agency, opened in mid-March with a blitz of ads
urging desperate moms to call. Ten thousand calls came during the first week.

''We've had children calling in asking where their daddies are,'' says Michael
Weinstein, president of Find Dad.

No one knows exactly how many of the nation's 6,000 bill-collecting agencies,
-which collect $ 70 billion a year, -are jumping into the child- support arena.
The San Antonio-based Child Support Collection Association, a national network
of agencies that refers cases to one another and splits fees, has 69 members.

''It's a perfect marriage. We know how to collect money,'' says Charles Drake,
association president and a San Antonio bill collector who says he wrested $ 1.6
million from scofflaw dads last year (he kept 18%).  For $ 5,000, Drake trains
other agencies on collecting back child support. The association is made up
mainly of agencies Drake trained.

Failure to pay child support is the primary cause of welfare dependency in the
USA, according to the Office of Child Support Enforcement, the federal agency
that oversees state and local efforts to collect child-support payments.

Swelling numbers of out-of-wedlock births and high divorce rates - the stuff of
which child-support orders are made - are overwhelming understaffed
public-collection systems, child-support experts say. And as cases multiply, so
do laws designed to track and collect from absent parents.

Private child-support-collection agencies, often divisions of larger bill-
collecting operations, generally go after non-welfare cases. They mostly market
services through ads portraying scofflaw fathers - 90% of absent parents are
fathers - as Porsche-driving bon vivants.

A Find Dad ad said, ''He loved you. Then he stopped. He adored the kids. Then he
stopped. ... We'll find him. And we won't stop.''

Clients, most often divorced mothers, usually pay an application fee of around $
25 and provide a copy of the court order mandating child-support payments. The
agency tracks the absent parent using national computer banks, credit bureaus
and personal information the custodial parent provides.

''In normal collection, I wouldn't have all these resources available,'' says
Drake.

Drake persuaded Thomas Alsup to write a $ 5,000 check, half the back child
support he owed to his ex-wife and 16-year-old son. Alsup, a telephone lineman
from Mesa, Ariz., also agreed to resume paying regular and increased support
payments, which chip away at the remaining debt.

''(Drake) was very threatening, told me he was going to take me to court, that
he was going to garnishee my wages,'' Alsup says. ''The last thing I need is to
go to court and have some judge put me in jail. Some of their threats actually
do work.''

But not every case winds up with a check and a satisfied customer.

In October, Gladys Williams of Portsmouth, Va., gave her $ 50,000 claim - and
her ex-husband's telephone number - to Child Support Services in Norfolk, Va.,
part of Drake's network.

''They told me that by Christmas, we would have some money,'' says Williams.
''They don't do anything.''

Drake, who is working the case because Williams' ex-husband lives in Texas, says
the dad is ''just flat refusing to pay.'' Williams' ex-husband refused to be
interviewed.

''Not every situation is going to happen overnight,'' Drake says.

And not every situation is collectable or profitable.

''This isn't just some bonanza,'' says Cohen, who says he earns less than $
100,000 a year from his child-support-collection business. ''There are (cases)
you work and work. Sometimes you collect, and sometimes you don't.''

Although it's unclear how much money agencies really earn from chasing
child-support debt, moms receiving checks for the first time know they are way
ahead.

Debra Zimmerlie, who was married to Alsup, plans to stay with Drake.

''As long as Tom knows that somebody's watching his back, he keeps spitting it
out,'' Zimmerlie says. ''And on time.''

For collectors, few holds barred

Collectors virtually smack their lips over child-support debt, legally a
top-priority debt.

The average child-support debt (typically around $ 10,000) dwarfs the average
consumer debt ($ 300) says the American Collectors Association. Money owed to
support kids isn't wiped off the books in case of bankruptcy. And if a scofflaw
dad dies, child support is among the first debts his estate must pay.

Further, child-support collectors don't labor under the 1977 Fair Debt
Collection Practices Act, which limits the kinds of harassment collectors of
consumer debt can use.

Michael Weinstein says his agency, Find Dad, takes ''the high road'' as a matter
of policy. ''As a matter of law, we don't have to.''

Class action suit accuses law firm of swindling property owners

BYLINE: David Yates

LENGTH: 591 words


In the eyes of some home owners there seems to be a collection force worse than
the IRS: lawyers hired by burdened cities to gather delinquent property taxes.

Representing Pete Gotcher, and all others similarly situated in the U.S.,
attorney Gilbert T. Adams filed a class-action lawsuit against the Linebarger,
Goggan Blair & Sampson law firm, claiming the attorneys suspect collection
methods violate the Texas Tax Code.

The suit was filed on Aug. 7 in the Jefferson County District Court.

For more than 30 years Linebarger Goggan has solely focused on collections.

"The early decision to concentrate our energy and resources on delinquent tax
collections in Texas led to successes that have elevated Linebarger Goggan from
a 'Texas firm' to the national stage," the firm's Web site said. "The firm is
now a major player in the collection industry with over 2,800 clients, serving
both the public and private sectors from offices in Arizona, California,
Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania,
Tennessee, Texas and Virginia."

According to the plaintiffs' original petition, Linebarger Goggan has been
charging and collecting fees from delinquent Texans that are not "expressly
provided for in the state's Tax Code."

"Despite the explicit provisions of the Tax Code and defendant's own contracts
which define the total compensation due, these defendants wrongfully and
deceitfully demand and extract payments from taxpayers in amounts exceeding
those permitted by law for abstract or title search fees," the suit said.

The suit says that in some instances the firm and its lawyers benefit directly
as "undisclosed principals" while in all instances the "defendants benefit by
passing on their overhead expenses to the taxpayers," and in no instances are
the fees a "liability of or payable by the taxing entities."

This is not the first suit of its kind. On behalf of Camella O'Brien,
plaintiffs' lawyer Adams first filed a lawsuit against Linebarger Goggan back in
2005.

O'Brien's suit also alleged the firm was "deceitfully scheming" money from
taxpayers in "amounts exceeding those permitted by law."

In essence, Adams and his clients argue Linebarger Goggan operate an "illegal
and deceptive practice," and maximize the firm's partners' profits by extracting
money, "which is in addition to statutorily authorized fees to attorneys," from
Texas property owners as "fees" not permitted by the Tax Code.

On the other hand, Linebarger Goggan says the firm places honesty and integrity
at the center of its professional duty, the firm's Web site stated.

"The firm has made an uncompromising commitment to the highest ethical standards
in the collection industry and the practice of law, reflected in the following
actions: the retention of an outside ethics advisor who is a former president of
the Texas State Bar; and the establishment of an in-house general counsel who
developed, implemented and oversees compliance with the firm's current code of
ethics."

The four-count suit faults the firm with fraud, negligent misrepresentation,
unjust enrichment and civil conspiracy.

"Linebarger Goggan has developed a scheme, plan or system for the extortion of
these monies and concealed their misdeeds," the suit said.

The plaintiffs seek a return of the monies allegedly "illegally obtained,"
common law and statutory damages, exemplary damages, "and to achieve a formal
declaration that such fees are not authorized," the suit said.

Judge Gary Sanderson, 60th Judicial District, has been assigned to the case.

Economy Watch: Job Growth, Delinquent Mortgages

LENGTH: 524  words

DATELINE: Baton Rouge


Louisiana State University Baton Rouge has issued the following news release:

The U.S. economy created 321,000 jobs in November, according to the Bureau of
Labor Statistics on Friday, which is well above the average monthly gain for the
past 12 months of 224,000. Job gains were widespread, led by growth in
professional and business services, retail trade, healthcare, and manufacturing,
the BLS noted.

Also, recent months were stronger than previously estimated. The change in total
employment for September was revised from a gain of 256,000 to one of 271,000,
and the change for October was revised from a gain of 214,000 to one of 243,000.
With these revisions, employment gains during those months combined were 44,000
more than previously reported.

The official U.S. unemployment rate, which is based on a separate BLS survey,
stayed at 5.8 percent in November, the same as in October, presumably indicating
an influx of job-seekers into the labor market. Before October, the last time
the headline rate was so low was in July 2008. During the mid-2000s, the rate
hovered between 4 percent and 5 percent.

Ahead of the monthly jobs report, the U.S. Department of Labor reported on
Thursday that for the week ending Nov. 29, initial unemployment claims were
297,000, a decrease of 17,000 from the previous week. The four-week moving
average was 299,000, a decrease of 4,750 from the previous week.

Delinquent Mortgages Continue Dropping

Black Knight Financial Services reported in its latest Mortgage Monitor on
Thursday that 5.44 percent of U.S. mortgages were delinquent in October, down
from 5.67 percent in September (delinquent meaning more than 30 days overdue,
but not in foreclosure yet). Also, 1.69 percent of mortgages were in the
foreclosure process, down from 2.54 percent a year earlier. Thus in October, a
total of 7.13 percent were either delinquent or in foreclosure.

The company also reported that there's been a sustained improvement in negative
equity over the past two and a half years. In January 2012, more than a third of
borrowers -- 33.5 percent - were underwater; less than 8 percent are now. Only
1.2 percent of U.S. mortgages have current CLTVs of 150 percent or higher, down
from 9.5 percent in January 2012.  Among the severely underwater - those
suffering 150 percent or higher CLTVs - more than a three-quarters of borrowers
(77 percent) are delinquent.

Ahead of the jobs numbers, Wall Street had a modest down day on Thursday, with
the Dow Jones Industrial Average off 12.52 points, or 0.07 percent. The S&P 500
and the Nasdaq were down 0.12 percent and 0.11 percent, respectively.

CITY STRUGGLING IN ATTEMPTS TO SELL TAX-DELINQUENT APARTMENT BUILDINGS

BYLINE: By MICHAEL GOODWIN

SECTION: Section B; Page 1, Column 1; Metropolitan Desk

LENGTH: 1524 words


New York City has spent about $285 million in the last three years under its
program to take over tax-delinquent apartment buildings, rehabilitate them and
restore them to the tax rolls, but it has sold only 200 of the more than 10,000
it has acquired.

More important, nonprofit community groups and tenant associations, which the
city hoped would buy many of the better occupied buildings, have bought only 16.
The remainder were primarily vacant buildings sold at auctions or to private
developers guaranteed Federal rent subsidies.

The program, run by the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, is
known as ''in rem,'' a name derived from the legal term for actions against
property. Foreclosure is the only way the city can penalize the building owners
because it has no legal right to recover the delinquent taxes through other
assets the owners might have.

The aim of the program is to allow the city to take title to buildings more than
a year delinquent in property taxes, rehabilitate them and resell them to
private owners who will maintain them and pay taxes. The number of foreclosures
has increased dramatically since the city passed a law in 1976 that shortened
the permitted period of delinquency from three years to one.

City Officials See Success

The effort to rehabilitate and resell the buildings began in 1978, with
municipal officials, including Mayor Koch, insisting that the city had no
intention of becoming the permanent ''landlord of last resort.'' The officials,
while conceding that the number of sales has been small, maintain that the
program is catching on and will eventually succeed.

Critics, however, say the buildings have not sold - and will not in the future -
because rents cannot cover the high costs of repairs and operation.

Housing officials assert that at least 500 more buildings will be sold by the
end of this year, including about 150 to community and tenant groups, and that
others will be sold when their rehabilitation is completed and other auctions
are held.

They also threaten to demolish every building that cannot be sold, including
those that tenants refused to buy.  ''There are only two bottom lines for every
building - sale or demolition,'' said Anthony B. Gliedman, the city's Housing
Commissioner.

Improvements Cited

William B. Eimicke, the deputy housing commissioner in charge of the program,
said that in each successive year, the city collected more rent, evicted more
tenants who refused to pay, reduced waste and fraud, and provided more and
better services, including heat and hot water, to the buildings' 35,000 tenants
-more than the population of Long Beach, L.I., or Fort Lee, N.J.

''I'm not saying there are no problems with in rem,'' he said, ''but we're so
much better than we were.'' About $104 million will be spent under the program
this fiscal year, Mr. Eimicke said - $11 million less than expected - and $17
million will be collected in rents. The program cost $75 million two years ago
and took in $12 million; last year it cost $107 million and collected $15.7
million. The city is paying about 25 percent of the cost, with the remainder
paid for by Federal Community Development funds.

While critics praise the city for improvements in the program, they say there is
no basis to assume that sales will increase. They contend that the city will be
stuck with the buildings permanently.

Losing Propositions

The city wants to sell the buildings, the critics say, for the same reason the
former owners abandoned them: Financially, they are losing propositions. And
given the high costs of operating and repairing the buildings, the critics say
it is impossible for the tenants - virtually all of whom have low incomes - to
pay enough rent.

''My biggest fear for in rem is that it is a bottomless pit,'' said Arthur
Zabarkas, executive director of the Citizens Housing and Planning Council, a
private group. ''I don't understand the city's ostrichlike denial of reality.''

He said that tenants could expect subsidies for repairs and routine operating
costs as long as the city owned the buildings, and that, once the city withdrew,
tenants would have to pay much higher rents to meet those costs and
tenant-owners would have to pay real-estate taxes.

''Why should tenants want to buy?'' he said. ''It's cheaper for them to have the
city own.'' Others, citing the same economic factors, say the solution is for
the city to realize that it must take responsibility for the continuing
operation of the buildings. They say tenants should not - and cannot - be
expected to meet those costs.

Government Aid Called Essential

''In many cases, the city is putting the tenants in leaky boats and telling them
to try to cross the ocean,'' said Sandy Bayer, executive director of the private
Task Force on City-Owned Property. ''There are no options for the buildings
without government help.''

He also criticized the city for not taking title to an additional 10,000
buildings that he said were more than a year behind in taxes.  City officials
publicly maintain that they are taking title as quickly as they can prepare
court papers and get court approval.  Privately, however, several admitted that
the city was deliberately slowing down the foreclosures because it did not know
what to do with many of the buildings it already owned.

Carol Bellamy, the City Council President, said that while selling all the
foreclosed buildings was a ''fine goal,'' she doubted whether it was
''achievable.'' The failure to sell more buildings, she added, indicated that
such larger issues as the future of rental housing for low-income groups were at
stake.

''I'm fearful that the policy issues are not being discussed as directly as they
ought to be,'' she added.  The city is trying to demolish many of the 6,500
vacant in rem buildings, and tenants in some have been moved to others under a
consolidation effort.

2 Categories of Occupied Buildings

The occupied buildings are divided into two major categories for administration
- central management and alternative management.  Central management covers the
3,000 buildings containing 22,000 tenants that the city runs. Alternative
management covers the 650 buildings containing 13,000 tenants that are run by
community groups, tenant associations, the Housing Authority and private
real-estate managers in coordination with the city.

The division of alternative management has a budget of about $30 million, with
the remainder of the entire program's money going into central management.
Although rents collected in central management buildings go into the city
treasury, the groups involved in central mangement are permitted to use the
rents they collect to run the buildings. Those rents are expected to total about
$20 million this year.

Individual tenants pay from $35 to $55 a room a month.  Vacant buildings are
considered the worst buildings, those in central management somewhat better and
those in alternative management the best. Alternative management is viewed as
the ''pipeline'' for eventual sale of the buildings to those now running them.

City officials acknowledge that no buyers will be found for many of the vacant
buildings, and that many of the occupied buildings in central management present
serious resale problems. About 1,000 of these, for example, are one- and
two-family buildings that presumably hold little interest for anyone wishing to
operate them for profit.

Collecting the Rents

Rent collection is a problem: The city collects from only about 60 percent of
its tenants in central management. Two years ago, the figure was less than 35
percent.

About 400 of the buildings in alternative management are in the two programs
known as community management and tenant interim lease.  Rents average about $50
a room, and about 85 percent of the tenants pay rent.

Although the city has cited these two programs as proof that turning buildings
over to tenants and community organizations is workable, community groups have
bought only six buildings and tenant cooperatives have bought only 10, at $250
an apartment.

Representatives of groups involved in these programs generally praised the
city's efforts and said tenants had better services and more repairs under city
ownership. But they said that even where tenants or groups wanted to buy, it was
virtually impossible for rents to cover costs.

''Without some rent subsidies, the numbers probably would not add up,'' said
Wilfredo Lugo, executive director of the Sunset Park Redevelopment Committee,
which manages six Brooklyn buildings. ''It would be a deficit operation.''

Make everyone pay their fair share: Implement Tax Clearance System in Pa.

SECTION: OPINION

LENGTH: 581 words


It's common sense: Everyone should pay their fair share. Yet, at a time in which
Harrisburg is struggling to enact a balanced budget and reconcile a projected
revenue shortfall of $3.1 billion, it is remarkable that there is over $3
billion in uncollected taxes owed to the commonwealth.

According to the Department of Revenue, over $1.5 billion of that is
collectable, meaning that the tax delinquents are known to the department. To
place that in context, $1.5 billion is enough to cover the general fund costs of
the Pennsylvania State Police and the Attorney General's Office for the next
three and a half years.

Though this problem did not occur overnight, there is a solution --
implementation of a Tax Clearance System.

Maryland, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Oklahoma and Missouri have each established a
Tax Clearance System in which persons or businesses seeking corporate or
professional licenses or renewals are prevented from receiving the license or
renewal until such time as they are current in their delinquent taxes.

The implementation of a similar program in Pennsylvania was studied by the
Department of Revenue at the request of the Legislature over five years ago.
Unfortunately, despite issuing a report that concluded that an integrated system
across various state taxing and licensing agencies would not only pay for itself
but would dramatically reduce delinquency rates, Harrisburg has failed to enact
this common sense solution.

A Tax Clearance System would not apply to persons seeking a driver's license or
a birth certificate. Rather, it would apply to applicants for various
professional or businesses licenses associated with income generation, such as
mortgage banker licenses, restaurant licenses, insurance adjuster licenses and
dry cleaner permits. A majority of the uncollected tax receipts is attributed to
delinquent corporate taxes, approximately $813 million. Delinquent sales and use
taxes, and employer withholding taxes account for approximately $400 million of
the total amount owed.

Pennsylvania already applies a similar system to applicants for casino licenses,
lottery retailers and liquor licenses, which ensures a low delinquency rate
within these industries.

According to the Department of Revenue study, a substantial collection rate is
projected, in addition to a substantial decrease in delinquency rates. In fact,
it was determined a Tax Clearance System would pay for itself within the first
two years of its implementation. Coupled with a limited tax amnesty program as
recently proposed in the state House, Pennsylvania can dramatically reverse its
delinquency rate, collect a substantial portion of the amount owed, and ensure
that everyone pays their fair share.

As working families are forced to make sacrifices in a difficult economy, so,
too, must Harrisburg learn to do more with less. However, if state government is
to operate more efficiently, the first step should be to improve its
tax-collection methods. As someone with extensive experience in the private
sector, I can assure you that any company with over $1.5 billion in uncollected
receipts would not be in business long.

A Tax Clearance System is a reasonable and workable solution to an inefficient
tax-collection system that rewards tax delinquents at the expense to those of us
who pay our fair share.

I.R.S. ONCE USED EMBARRASSMENT AS DELINQUENTS' PENALTY IN IDAHO

BYLINE: UPI

SECTION: Section A; Page 24, Column 3; National Desk

LENGTH: 512 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 23


Some people in Idaho who neglected to pay Federal taxes on time in the early
1970's say they found their offices padlocked, their automobiles chained to
telephone poles and themselves publicly embarrassed.

The incidents were apparently instigated by an Internal Revenue Service official
who had recommended public embarassment as a way to make delinquents pay up,
according to a service memorandum. The document was presented Thursday by the
Church of Scientology to a Senate subcommittee.

The revenue service confirmed the authenticity of the memo, and a number of
people in Idaho said they recalled such incidents vividly.

Truck Chained to Tree

A number of northern Idaho residents, for example, recalled agents' padlocking
doors to local restaurants when owners were behind in paying taxes.

Robert Hammes, publisher of The St.  Maries Gazette, said he remembered an
incident in which a logger's pi ckup truck had been chained to a telephone pole
by I.R.S. agents.  ''Then they posted an order on the windshield and left
town,'' Mr.  Hammes said.

Agents put locks on the doors of an office in Sandpoint because six lawyers who
worked there were delinquent on taxes.  The memo was presented by the Church of
Scientology to Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, whose Government
Operations Subcommittee issued a report last fall on some questionable practices
by the revenue service regarding small businesses. The church, in its
longrunning battle with the Government, obtained the document in a suit filed
under the Freedom of Information Act. A trial is under way in Los Angeles on a
Church of Scientology suit contending that some I.R.S. tax laws are
unconstitutional.

Collection Methods Changed

Philip Sansotta, who became the head of the service's office in Idaho in 1977,
said he had learned on assuming the job that agents had been instructed in
methods of collecting overdue taxes by publicly embarrassing delinquent
taxpayers.

''There's nothing like that going on now, '' he said. ''Not since I walked in
the door in 1977.'' The memo on how to get delinquents to pay up was distributed
in 1973, when Ho ward Martin, who now works in Washington, was chief of the
Idaho off ice.

The memo ''is rife with errors in judgment,'' Howard Waffle, an I.R.S.
spokesman, said. ''It did not reflect any kind of national policy.''

The author of the memo was not identified, but Mr. Waffle said the strategy was
proposed by a supervisor.  ''A proven method of preventing delinquency has been
through embarrassment to certain taxpayers,'' the memo said. ''It has been my
experience that seizures which result in 'sensationalism' tend to remain fixed
in the public's mind and are a great deterrent of delinquency.''

Arcade one of many liens sold by county;
The downtown property could face foreclosure if delinquent property taxes are
not resolved within a year.

SECTION: LOCAL; Pg. A4

DAYTON - The Arcade and nearly 1,800 other Montgomery County properties could
face foreclosure if delinquent property tax obligations are not resolved within
a year.

County Treasurer Hugh Quill held his office's second tax certificate lien sale
auction Saturday. Quill sold $6.8 million in liens to American Tax Funding
Servicing, including liens of nearly $250,000 on the Arcade in downtown Dayton.

The Jupiter, Fla., firm beat out four other lenders who vied for the liens,
buying the entire liens portfolio.

Before the auction, delinquent taxpayers only had to pay overdue taxes to be
free of liens. Affected debtors now have to pay unpaid taxes, fees and 14
percent interest to American Tax Funding Servicing.

That company also won last year's lien auction, paying the county $9.1 million
for taxes owed on 1,986 properties.

The sale of the tax liens does not mean the property has been sold.

Property owners have a year to pay overdue bills in full or get on a payment
plan. After that time, American Tax Funding can initiate foreclosure on the
property.

Quill said the lien sale will benefit the public bodies that benefit from the
collection of property taxes.

"We will be able to distribute (the money) to schools and local governments in
January," Quill said. Quill's office published a list of 5,000 delinquent
properties and their owners in the Dayton Daily News recently.

Partly as a result of that action, $12 million in unpaid property taxes were
paid.

Thousands of property owners went on payment plans, Quill said. The treasurer
cautioned owners of parcels affected by the lien sale to avoid predatory leaders
and urged them to contact his office to set up payment plans.

Tony Staub, who owns the Arcade through Brownfield Charities Inc., went on a
payment plan ahead of last year's lien sale.

But Staub, who took title to the Arcade in 2004, only made the first payment on
the plan, about $8,000, according to Quill's office.

The Arcade is appraised at $2.3 million and has an $250,000 unpaid tax bill for
a four-year period.

Staub declined comment when reached by phone Saturday. He has tried to sell the
complex on eBay and has said heating and maintaining the Arcade costs about
$200,000 a year.

The Arcade was by far the most prominent property affected at Saturday's lien
sale.

Other Montgomery County property owners recorded as having unpaid tax bills
include: NBC USA Inc., $122,000; Hutchins Investments Inc., $117, 846; and
Financial South Office Partner Limited, $117,765, the treasurer's office said.

Ohio has allowed its most populous counties to sell liens to financial lenders
in large bundles since 1998.

Ohio County Considers Tax Lien Sale Collection Plan

BYLINE: Darren Waggoner

SECTION: CCR - DEALS & PRICING Vol. 1 No. 1

LENGTH: 258  words


Tax delinquencies in Columbiana County, Ohio have dropped from $11 million in
January 2013 to the current $10 million as a result of county officials mailing
warnings to property owners to avoid foreclosure by paying in 30 days or
arranging a payment plan. Now, county officials want a faster, more efficient
alternative to help lower delinquencies even more.

Columbiana County Treasurer Linda Bolon has notified county commissioners that
she is reviewing contracting with a company to pursue the county's long-term
property tax delinquents.Tax Ease Ohio LLC is used by at least 24 other Ohio
counties. The county would sell its delinquent properties as a bundle through a
tax lien sale and the successful bidder would pursue the delinquent taxes, with
property owners given up to one year to pay their delinquent taxes, along with
interest of up to 18%, fees and penalties. After one year the company could
start foreclosure proceedings."It's basically like a collection agency," she
said.Bolon said only long-term, hard-to-collect delinquent properties likely
would be included in the tax lien sale. She plans to meet with Tax Ease in May
and hopes to be able to hold a tax lien sale in 2015.Any money received from the
tax lien sale would be distributed by the treasurer's office to local
governments. Bolon said it's impossible for a limited county staff to keep up
with the millions in back taxes. She said many local entities rely on the taxes
as a source of operating income, including school districts that receive 70% of
all property taxes.

CFPB Clarifies Frequency of Early Intervention Notices

LENGTH: 358  words

DATELINE: New York



 Little Rock: Cornerastone Credit Union League, The State of Arkansas has issued
the following news release:



 The new mortgage servicing rule from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
clarifies the frequency of required written early intervention notices. A
mortgage servicer must provide a written notice to a delinquent borrower no
later than the 45th day of the borrower's delinquency but is not required to
send the notice more than once in any 180-day period.





 The new rule clarifies that:



     If a borrower is 45 days or more delinquent at the end of any 180-day
period after the servicer has provided the written notice, a servicer must
provide the written notice again not later than 180 days after providing the
prior written notice; and

     If a borrower is less than 45 days delinquent at the end of any 180-day
period after the servicer has provided the written notice, a servicer must
provide the written notice again no later than 45 days after the delinquent
payment due date.



 The rule also includes new examples in the official interpretation to the rule,
which further illustrate the written notice requirements.



     Servicing transfers: The rule clarifies that a transferee servicer is
required to comply with the written notice requirements regardless of whether
the transferor servicer provided a written notice to the borrower in the
preceding 180-day period. However, if the transferor provided the written notice
within 45 days of the transfer date, the transferee servicer is not required to
provide another written notice until 45 days after the first post-transfer
payment due date; and

     Successors in interest: Confirmation of a successor in interest does not
restart the 180-day period if the prior notice triggering the 180-day waiting
period was provided to a transferor borrower. The CFPB has recognized that this
would be unnecessarily burdensome and a confirmed successor in interest may
obtain information from mortgage servicers using a request for information, to
which servicers must respond.

I.

  The Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") deems it necessary and
appropriate for the protection of investors that public administrative
proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 12(j) of the
Securities Exchange Act of
1934 ("Exchange Act") against Respondents Akesis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Skye
International, Inc., Stellar Resources, Ltd., and Thwapr, Inc.

having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 10-Q for the period
ended September 30, 2008, which reported a net loss of $4,109,185 for the prior

quoted on OTC Link, had five market makers, and was eligible for the "piggyback"
exception of Exchange Act Rule 15c2-11(f)(3). On January 30, 2009, the company

2. Skye International, Inc. (CIK No. 1095751) is a revoked Nevada corporation
located in Scottsdale, Arizona with a class of securities registered with the
Commission pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(g). Skye International is
delinquent in its periodic filings with the Commission, having not filed any
periodic reports since it filed a Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30,
2010, which reported a net loss of $1,435,326 for the prior nine months. On

B. DELINQUENT PERIODIC FILINGS

their periodic filings with the Commission, have repeatedly failed to meet their
obligations to file timely periodic reports, and failed to heed delinquency
letters sent to them by the Division of Corporation Finance requesting
compliance with their periodic filing obligations or, through their failure to
maintain a valid address on file with the Commission as required by Commission
rules, did not receive such letters.

6. Exchange Act Section 13(a) and the rules promulgated thereunder require
issuers of securities registered pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12 to file
with the Commission current and accurate information in periodic reports, even
if the registration is voluntary under Section 12(g). Specifically, Rule 13a-1
requires issuers to file annual reports, and Rule 13a-13 requires domestic
issuers to file quarterly reports.

7. As a result of the foregoing, Respondents failed to comply with Exchange Act
Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and/or 13a-13 thereunder.
III.

  In view of the allegations made by the Division of Enforcement, the Commission

deems it necessary and appropriate for the protection of investors that public
administrative proceedings be instituted to determine:

A. Whether the allegations contained in Section II hereof are true and, in
connection therewith, to afford the Respondents an opportunity to establish any
defenses to such allegations; and,

B. Whether it is necessary and appropriate for the protection of investors to
suspend for a period not exceeding twelve months, or revoke the registration of
each class of securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act
of the
Respondents identified in Section II hereof, and any successor under Exchange
Act Rules 12b-2 or 12g-3, and any new corporate names of any Respondents.

IV.

  IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that a public hearing for the purpose of taking
evidence on the questions set forth in Section III hereof shall be convened at a
time and place to be fixed, and before an Administrative Law Judge to be
designated by further order as provided by Rule 110 of the Commission's Rules of
Practice [17 C.F.R. § 201.110].

  IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that Respondents shall file an Answer to
the allegations contained in this Order within ten (10) days after service of
this Order, as provided by Rule 220(b) of the Commission's Rules of Practice [17
C.F.R. § 201.220(b)].

  If Respondents fail to file the directed Answers, or fail to appear at a
hearing after being duly notified, the Respondents, and any successor under
Exchange Act Rules 12b-2 or 12g-3, and any new corporate names of any
Respondents, may be deemed in default and the proceedings may be determined
against them upon consideration of this Order, the allegations of which may be
deemed to be true as provided by Rules 155(a), 220(f), 221(f), and 310 of the
Commission's Rules of Practice [17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a), 201.220(f), 201.221(f),
and 201.310].

  This Order shall be served forthwith upon Respondents personally or by
certified, registered, or Express Mail, or by other means permitted by the
Commission Rules of Practice.

  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Administrative Law Judge shall issue an
initial decision no later than 120 days from the date of service of this Order,
pursuant to Rule 360(a)(2) of the Commission's Rules of Practice [17 C.F.R. §
201.360(a)(2)].

  In the absence of an appropriate waiver, no officer or employee of the
Commission engaged in the performance of investigative or prosecuting functions
in this or any factually related proceeding will be permitted to participate or
advise in the decision of this matter, except as witness or counsel in
proceedings held pursuant to notice. Since this proceeding is not "rule making"
within the meaning of Section 551 of the Administrative Procedure Act, it is not
deemed subject to the provisions of Section 553 delaying the effective date of
any final Commission action.

  By the Commission.

Frackville mulls "selling" delinquent debts to collection agency

BYLINE: Leslie Richardson, Republican & Herald, Pottsville, Pa.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 424 words


Jul. 9--FRACKVILLE -- The borough council is attempting to get some of the money
owed on delinquent taxes and garbage collection fees.

The council agreed during a meeting Wednesday to look into hiring a collection
agency to purchase delinquent debts.

According to a report included in Wednesday's meeting, borough residents owe
more than $67,000 in delinquent real estate taxes and more than $65,000 in
delinquent garbage fees.

An agency would "buy" the debt from the borough, paying about 90 percent of the
amount owed. The agency would then set up its collection against the taxpayers.

The council will solicit information before hiring an agency.

Councilman Stephen Bobiak voted against looking into the debt collection method.

In other news:

-- Bobiak motioned to bring in a real estate agent to find tenants for the
borough building.

The borough has owned the former Frackville Elementary School building for about
two years and had initially anticipated a number of renters coming into the
building to share expenses.

So far only Borough Hall and the police station have relocated to the building.

Interest was expressed at one time by the Frackville Public Library, but the
library board opted to rehabilitate its current facility on Lehigh Avenue.

The council agreed to the idea and Bobiak said a Realtor would know how to
market the building to potential tenants.

Bobiak is expected to have the names of potential Realtors by the August
meeting.

-- The council also voted to enter into an agreement with On Demand Energy
Solutions through the Schuylkill Chamber of Commerce for a layered energy
purchase based on the kilowatt hours used in previous years.

The program analyzes electricity usage patterns, evaluates available supply
options and recommends the supplier that will save the most money.

On Demand is based in Pittsburgh and is licensed by the Public Utility
Commission as an energy consultant/broker.

Councilman Patrick J. O'Boyle said the layered program option will provide
savings to the borough because of the fluctuating price of energy.

He said 40 county municipalities have signed up for the program.

Modified Loans Often Lead Homeowners Back to Trouble

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

SECTION: Section B; Column 0; Business/Financial Desk; Pg. 5

LENGTH: 415 words


Most troubled homeowners whose mortgages were modified are again falling behind
on payments, a top banking regulator said on Monday, raising questions about
whether policy makers and lenders can successfully help them stay in their
homes.

Data from banks show that more than half  of loans modified during the first
three months of the year were delinquent by 30 days just six months after the
terms of the loans were changed, John C. Dugan, the comptroller of the currency,
said at a conference in Washington. After eight months, 58 percent were
delinquent again.

The  rate at which borrowers fall behind payments again --  called the
re-default rate -- appears to be much higher than what previous  studies have
found. In October, a Credit Suisse study showed that about 30 percent of loans
modified at the end of last year were delinquent by 60 days within eight months
of the change.

Mr. Dugan said it was unclear why the re-default rates were so high after
modifications made by the 14 banks that provided data to his office. He
acknowledged that ''we have to be careful as we look at this data.'' One
explanation for the high re-default rate might be that banks were not
significantly changing the terms of the loans they modified.

Analysts at Credit Suisse have found that modifications that do not lower
borrowers' monthly payments were more than twice as likely to become delinquent
again than changes that reduced payments. Banks like Chase, Citigroup and Bank
of America have only recently put more emphasis on lowering monthly payments.

Some loans may also be so poorly underwritten that no modification could help
the borrowers stay in homes that they can no longer afford, Mr. Dugan said. That
would confirm other studies that show homeowners who become delinquent are much
more likely to lose their homes today than in the past.

The Mortgage Bankers Association said last week that 30 percent of homeowners
who miss one payment end up in foreclosure a few months later. Historically,
only 12 percent to 15 percent fell that far behind and most borrowers were able
to catch up, sell their home or strike a better deal with their lender. In
California, however,  75 percent  of homeowners who miss one payment end up in
foreclosure; in Florida,  65 percent who miss a payment do.

A sharp drop in home prices has made it much harder for homeowners to sell their
properties for as much as they owe and rising unemployment is putting more
borrowers in financial distress.

TAXATION AND REPRESENTATION Alpharetta targets tax delinquents

BYLINE: By Carlos Campos STAFF WRITER

SECTION: EXTRA; Section H; Page 3

LENGTH: 289 words


City officials in Alpharetta are on a mission to collect almost $ 700,000 in
delinquent property taxes, vowing to take whatever measures necessary to
accomplish their goal.

Since 1983 property owners have failed to pay the city $ 679,613.50 in taxes,
penalties and interest. One-third of that amount - $ 273,994.68 - is tied up in
appraisal appeals in Fulton County.

Alpharetta uses an appraisal value set by the county to determine its property
tax assessment, according to City Administrator Michael Wilkes. The appeal
causes the county's assessment, as well as the city's, to come into question.

Still, the city is pursuing the other $ 405,618.82 in outstanding taxes. Since
it began its campaign to collect the back taxes several weeks ago, Wilkes said
his staff has collected $ 162,581.06.

City officials have sent out letters to delinquent accounts and have started to
place liens against those properties, making it difficult for owners to sell.

The city also is looking into hiring an agency to help it collect the money and
adding the agency's fees to the delinquent tax account. As a last resort, the
city can seize the property and auction it to the highest bidder, Wilkes said.

Growth in Alpharetta, with the addition of hundreds of homes and businesses in
the past few years, has added to the problem, since the number of delinquent
accounts increases with the tax base, Wilkes said.

"But I'm not as concerned about the fact that the numbers have grown as I am
about the fact that we haven't done anything about it in the past," Wilkes said.
"For some reason, I'm not sure what the reason is . . . I would say that in
previous years there hadn't been maybe the emphasis put on delinquent tax
collection."

Bidders Can Attend Tax Auction In Their Jammies

BYLINE: CARLOS MONCADA, cmoncada@tampatrib.com

HILLSBOROUGH, PINELLAS TO HOLD SALES ONLINE

By CARLOS MONCADA

cmoncada@tampatrib.com

CLEARWATER - Ever place a bid with an online auction site such as eBay or Yahoo?

Well, bidding on tax certificates in Pinellas and Hillsborough counties this
year won't be much different.

For the first time, the two counties will auction certificates for delinquent
real estate taxes on the Internet as several other Florida counties have done,
including Polk County.

By conducting the auctions in cyberspace rather than the traditional county
courthouse locations, officials expect to sell more certificates to more people
in less time and at less cost.

Rather than come to a room, hold up signs and shout out their bids, investors of
all stripes will be able to sit at their computers to bid on thousands of
certificates representing properties with several million dollars in delinquent
taxes.

It means more convenience and competition for bidders, less expense for
government and less burden on the delinquent taxpayer, officials said.

In Florida, unpaid real estate taxes become delinquent April 1, and tax
certificate sales are held on or before June 1.

Bidding starts at 18 percent and goes down, with the lowest interest rate
winning. The winning bidder pays the taxes owed on the property, then gets back
the initial investment plus the interest when the tax debtor pays.

Polk sold 12 percent more certificates electronically last year than it did in
2004, said Martha Roe Burke, director of compliance and taxpayer affairs for
Polk Tax Collector Joe Tedder.

Polk had 1,619 registered bidders from all over the country, compared with 108
the year before, Burke said. The increased competition drove down the average
interest rate of tax certificates purchased to 5.5 percent, compared with 6.91
percent in 2004 and 8.78 in 2003.

That's good for the taxpayer, Burke said, but not so good for the investor.

Polk, Pinellas and Hillsborough will use Realauction.com, a Fort Lauderdale
company that specializes in online government auctions.

"This will increase the number of bidders who can participate and yield the most
favorable interest rate for the distressed taxpayer," Pinellas County Tax
Collector Diane Nelson said.

Small local investors often are at a disadvantage at the courthouse auctions.
Large investors, some from out of state, often place multiple bids on properties
and take the bidding down to a quarter-point range to win the certificate,
knowing that Florida law guarantees at least 5 percent.

Holding the auctions online should help "level the playing field between the
institutional investors and the mom-and-pop bidders," said Craig McIntyre,
commercial director for Realauctions.com.

"You've got more competitive bidding as opposed to the good ol' boys who would
go into the auction rooms and sweep up all the certificates between them," he
said.

Pasco County is not going online this year but may in 2007, tax collector Mike
Olson said.

Counties chase unpaid taxes;
Montgomery property owners' late bills top $100 million.Officials alter strategy
to motivate payment.;
TAXES

BYLINE: ByJoanne Huist Smith

SECTION: MAIN; Pg. A1

LENGTH: 799 words


Property owners in Montgomery County owe more than $100 million in delinquent
real estate taxes, depriving schools, cities and other taxing authorities of
critical funding.

The same is true in neighboring counties, but not to the same degree, according
to county auditors and treasurers.

* In Greene County, property tax delinquencies total more than $8.2 million.

* Miami County property owner have about $6 million in back taxes on the books.

* In Warren County, the figure is just under $20 million.

The Dayton Daily News examined property tax delinquencies around the region and
what counties are doing to collect the taxes.

County treasurers - responsible for tax collection - encourage delinquent
property owners to meet their obligations with installment payment plans, and
Montgomery County has launched a new strategy giving some owners more time to
pay their bills in hope of gathering the millions of dollars owed.

"Our biggest goal is to keep people in their homes," Greene County Treasurer
Richard Gould said. "I offer everyone a payment plan, at least once."

Montgomery County Treasurer Carolyn Rice has changed the collections philosophy
of her office. In the past, the focus was strictly on the delinquent amount,
said Paul Robinson, Montgomery County's deputy treasurer. But that didn't fix
the problem because the taxes still accrue.

The county will now consider expanding its two-year installment payment plan -
based on a discussion with the property owner - to stretch payments over a
longer period. Estimated future taxes also become part of the payment plan,
Robinson said.

"Just getting people through the door is a victory, but we've had a 50 percent
failure rate on those 24-month plans, Robinson said. "There was something in the
plan that didn't lead to success."

Only about one-third of Montgomery County's delinquent property owners are on
payment plans. Robinson said he wants property owners to know they have options.

The treasurer's office will develop a workable plan with them to stay current
and pay off back taxes, including stretching some payments over 2? to three
years, Robinson said.

"Obviously, we have to work within the property owner's budget," he said.

An analysis of property tax delinquencies over 10 years by the Montgomery County
Treasurer's Office revealed the best chance of collecting back taxes is within
the first three years of delinquency.

"That emphasizes the need to go after newly delinquent property owners,"
Robinson said.

Most single family homeowners want to pay their tax bills, Robinson said. It's
the limited liability companies that are a huge problem in Montgomery County.

"A typical LLC only has that (one) property as an asset," Robinson said. "There
is no other asset to seize."

Treasurers in Greene, Miami and Warren counties offer plans that let property
owners pay off delinquent taxes over 2? years in five installments.

Greene County Auditor David Graham said the county will bill $239,544,248 in
property taxes for tax year 2012, for collection in 2013. Total unpaid
delinquent taxes currently include about $519,254 in special assessments and
$7.7 million in real estate taxes.

Whether it be out of fear, lack of funds or avoidance, many delinquent property
owners don't make that first step to settle their tax bills until they have to,
Gould said.

"Unfortunately, what gets their attention is the delinquency tax letters we send
out in September," Gould said. "When people get a letter saying we're going to
foreclose, they come in and talk to us."

David Swigert, Warren County's chief deputy treasurer, said his office also
offers a monthly payment option, in addition to the semiannual one.

"That breaks down payments into smaller chunks," he said. "There is no
installment due the month 'current taxes' are due."

In Miami County, installment payments are due in February and July, when current
taxes are due, Treasurer Jim Stubbs said.

When efforts to contact delinquent property owners fail, Montgomery County takes
an additional step. The treasurer's office has held two tax lien sales this
year, to bump up collections.

In a tax lien sale, county treasurers sell past-due taxes to a third party. The
advantage for local governments and schools is that they don't have to wait for
the property owners to pay their tax bills to get the revenue. The disadvantage
for the property owner is additional interest is added to their tax bills.

At sales held on June 13 and Nov. 27, Montgomery County Treasurer's Office sold
a total of 651 tax liens valued at $4.6 million. The greater yield came from
property owners agreeing to payment plans or paying off their taxes to avoid
inclusion in the tax lien sale. Altogether, the two sales generated $27.5
million in tax payments.

L.A. area foreclosure activity falls

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A1

LENGTH: 447 words


Foreclosure activity in metropolitan Los Angeles slowed in the second quarter,
with the region ranking well below the nation's 25 most-distressed communities,
according to a study released Tuesday.

Los Angeles fell from 98th place in the first quarter to 124th in the second
quarter in terms of foreclosure activity, said Foreclosure-Response.org, which
based its report on loan performance data provided by LPS Applied Analytics.

The region ranked 68th in loans that are considered seriously delinquent,
compared with 64th the previous quarter.

"Relative to other places, things have gotten better in Los Angeles," said
Jeffrey Lubell, executive director of the Center for Housing Policy, a partner
in the website.

The group tracks the foreclosure landscape in 366 of the nation's metro areas.

In Los Angeles, the report said, 4.6 percent of loans were in foreclosure from
April through June, and 6.4 percent were at least 90 days past due.

The number of loans considered seriously delinquent is the total of those two
numbers, or 11 percent for the metro area. That's down slightly from 11.7 in the
first quarter.

A year earlier, the rate of loans in Los Angeles considered seriously delinquent
was 9.9 percent.

While the foreclosure inventory may continue to climb as past-due loans move
into foreclosure, there is reason to think the problem may be stabilizing,
Lubell said.

"There may still be more foreclosures to come but the rate of foreclosures is
declining," Lubell said. "There is a quarter-to-quarter improvement. If that
trend were to continue, it would be quite encouraging."

If anything, activity here seems to have flattened out, he said.

In contrast, the Miami-Fort Lauderdale-Pompano Beach area ranks first in
foreclosures and serious mortgage delinquencies with rates of 17.8 and 25.6
percent, respectively.

And Florida could be in for some more housing pain and foreclosures, the report
noted. That state dominated the top 25 list and placed nine cities in the top
10.

By comparison, California had seven of the 25 metro areas with the highest
serious delinquency rates. Among those were the Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario
areas, where 17 percent of mortgages are in foreclosure or three months past
due.

Andrew LePage, an analyst at MDA DataQuick, said that it appears Los Angeles,
and some parts of California, are recovering from the flood of foreclosures on
subprime loans that were rapidly flushed through the system and drove down
housing prices.

"Does it appear we'll see that again? No, there hasn't been any evidence of
that, but that's not to say we won't be at a relatively high level of
foreclosures for the next two years or so."

Change announced in delinquent tax repayment schedule

BYLINE: Diana Dickinson, Claremore Daily Progress, Okla.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 402 words


July 23--People who have been making monthly payments on delinquent real
property taxes to the county -- and have recently had their payments returned --
might be wondering why.

There has been a change in the way those payments will be handled, effective
immediately, according to the new county treasurer.

Rogers County Treasurer Jason Carini said early Wednesday morning that statute
determines how such taxes should be paid.

"I want to do things according to law and not bend any rules," he said.

The Oklahoma statute on revenue and taxation -- a copy of which was provided by
Carini -- states, "In no event may payment be made in more than two equal
installments subject to the provisions of the payment schedule specified."

Taxes levied for each fiscal year are always due on Nov. 1. The specified
payment schedule allows taxpayers to pay half of the levied taxes prior to Jan.
1 and the second half before April 1.

The payments of taxpayers who haven't adhered to that schedule will be
considered late, the treasurer said.

"They could have made it in the two installments, but they are too late. That is
over $1.2 million (in delinquent taxes) which affects our schools, fire
departments and so on," Carini said.

"If delinquent taxes are not paid there will be interest applied and possible
penalties and publication fees," the treasurer added.

If the first part of the taxes due was not paid before Jan. 1 then the entire
tax bill amount would be considered delinquent. The delinquent balance will
accrue at one and a half percent interest per month.

"I understand this will affect a lot of people, but everything I do here has to
be done by law," he added.

Close to 60,000 "tax due" notifications are mailed out each year, Carini said.

Last year, nearly 3,000 county taxpayers made monthly payments on their real
property taxes that were past due.

For delinquent business and personal taxes, the Treasurer's office is required
to send out tax warrant letters, which is part of the county's Tax Warrant
Program. Carini said he does not plan to start the tax warrant program for a few
months. More information will be made available when the program starts, he
said.

Anyone with questions may call the treasurer's office at (918) 923-4797.

Bill to boot deadbeats advances;
Dvorak aims to push public officials from office if they owe child support.

BYLINE: By JONDI SCHMITT, Tribune Correspondent

SECTION: LOCAL; Pg. B1

LENGTH: 408 words


INDIANAPOLIS -- Should an elected official who is more than $15,000 behind in
child support payments be allowed to continue to hold office?

State Rep. Ryan Dvorak says no.

Dvorak, D-Mishawaka, co-authored a bill that would remove any elected official
from office if the person has been $15,000 or more delinquent on child support
payments for more than 30 days.

The bill passed the Indiana House of Representatives by a 92-2 vote Tuesday.

"We had a situation that arose up in South Bend," he said. "The issue that arose
out of it and where I got a lot of really genuine anger from constituents is
that they couldn't believe that someone who is in an elected office would be
allowed to stay when they are so far delinquent on child support."

Dvorak was alluding to Roseland Town Council member David Snyder, who has an
ongoing court case over his unpaid child support.

He recently was stripped of his real estate broker's license because of the
unpaid support, and court records showed he owed more than $90,000 as of Oct. 1.
Dvorak said he chose $15,000 as the line because it is at that level that the
person can be charged with a Class C felony.

"I know people can fall behind on their payments, and there are situations like
that," Dvorak said.

"So, I wanted to make sure this was set at a level where someone is seriously
delinquent and not just having a temporary problem."

Constituents from the Roseland and South Bend areas expressed a concern to
Dvorak about garnishment of wages in these cases.

"Someone who is this delinquent is going to be having their checks garnisheed,"
he said. "The checks of a public official are coming from the taxpayers, and I
don't think taxpayers are comfortable paying the salary of somebody when it just
goes right into their own personal child support."

The bottom line is that public officials have to display a responsibility to
handle the job for which they are elected, Dvorak said.

"They are entrusted with administering public funds, public programs and I think
there is a certain measure of one's capability to do the job," Dvorak said. "If
you can't maintain the support of your own dependents, then you might not be
qualified to do the job as well."

Dvorak said the bill already has bipartisan support in the Senate, where it
still must pass to be sent to the governor to be signed into law.

State Sens. John Broden, D-South Bend, and Marvin Riegsecker, R-Goshen, will
sponsor the bill in the Senate, Dvorak said.

Tax deliquencies up, down in area counties

BYLINE: Laura Gossman, Post-Bulletin, Rochester, Minn.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 389 words


Mar. 24--Some southeastern Minnesota counties saw an increase in tax
delinquencies this year, but others saw a decrease.

Dodge County's list of tax deliquencies is longer than in past years, said
finance director Lisa Kramer.

"There's been an increase in residential property delinquencies," Kramer said.
"Eleven more residential parcels are delinquent compared to last year."

While the list is long, Kramer said land developers owe less money in taxes
because most of the lots are without houses.

Dodge County has a tax levy of $21 million, and there's a property tax
delinquency of about $348,000 for 2008.

Kramer was unable to compare that to 2007 because some people have paid their
property taxes since the list was first published in local papers. Nonetheless,
property owners still owe about $123,000 for 2007.

"Dodge County residents have always been pretty good about paying their property
taxes," Kramer said.

Wabasha County treasurer Jerry Leisen said he was surprised that tax
delinquencies in the county had decreased. He said 200 parcels were delinquent
in 2007 and only 167 parcels were delinquent in 2008.

He couldn't pinpoint what caused the number to decrease for 2008 but mentioned
that back taxes might have been paid after mortgages were foreclosed.

"This past year there were a lot of mortgage foreclosures so the banks have
stepped in," Leisen said. "The properties are typically sold at sheriff's
auctions so back taxes usually get paid on the property at that time."

Goodhue County finance director Carolyn Holmsten said she hasn't seen a big
increase in delinquent properties, but the county is watching it closely.

"We've got a diligent process of reminding property owners they need to pay,"
Holmsten said. "We send out letters twice a year, and they really rush to pay
their taxes when we remind them that we are required to print the names of
people who are delinquent in the local newspaper."

One-third of Americans are delinquent on their debt

LENGTH: 992  words


Washington, D.C.: American Land Title Association has issued the following news
release:

If you've been on the receiving end of an unsolicited phone call from a debt
collector, you're far from alone.

More than one-third of Americans (35%) had debt in collections in 2013,  putting
their credit and job prospects at risk, according to a new study by the Urban
Institute, which analyzed credit reporting data for more than 7 million
consumers. The report is based on data from TransUnion, one of the three major
credit reporting agencies.

In order to be released to debt collectors, unpaid balances have to be more than
180 days past due. Of the 35% of Americans with non-mortgage debt in
collections, the average amount owed was $5,178, according to the report.
Although researchers weren't able to break down the types of debt by category,
they can include things like credit card balances, student loan debt, medical or
utility bills, parking tickets and even gym membership fees.

Delinquent debts are prevalent across the country. Overall debt on things like
credit cards, student loans and auto loans increased by $129 billion -- or 1.1%
-- in the first quarter of 2014 compared to the previous quarter, according to
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

People from certain states and regions are more likely to wind up on debt
collectors' speed dial than others. In Nevada, nearly half (47%) of consumers
had seriously delinquent debt, according to the report, with an average balance
of $7,198, the highest of any state. At least 40% of residents in a dozen other
states have debt in collections, 11 of which are in the South. States with the
fewest number of residents with debts in collections were mostly in the Midwest,
including states like North Dakota, which had the lowest rate (19.2%), followed
by Minnesota (19.8%) and South Dakota (20.8%).

"Debt in collections is pervasive and threads through nearly all communities,"
says Caroline Ratcliffe, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute. "This is
important because delinquent debt can harm credit scores, limit access to credit
and [make credit] more expensive."'

The long-term effects of debt can be crippling. Past due debts not only make
credit more expensive and harder for consumers to access, but it can weaken
their chances at getting a job as well. Some employers routinely run background
and credit report checks on prospective job candidates.

Dealing with debt collectors

As if the stress of unpaid bills weren't difficult enough to endure,
communicating with debt collectors, who can often be pushy and aggressive, is no
cake walk.

Consumers filed 204,000 complaints against debt collectors with the Federal
Trade Commission in 2013, up from 199,000 the year prior and the highest level
since the agency began keeping track in 1999.  The most common complaint filed
concerned debt collectors that allegedly lied about the amounts a consumer owed
and the nature of their delinquency, followed by firms that called too often.

"This is a major consumer protection problem," says Chris Koegel, assistant
director of financial practices at the FTC. "We devote a significant amount of
our resources to trying to clean up the practices in this industry."

Part of the challenge of reining in unscrupulous debt collectors is that if a
borrower is embarrassed or feels guilty about having a delinquent debt, he or
she may take abuse from collectors without ever reporting it. Some people have
even been tricked into believing they owe debts that don't exist, an
increasingly common ploy the FTC calls "phantom debt collecting."  In the scam,
a collections agency will call a consumer, inform them of a nonexistent debt and
bully them into making payments, often threatening arrest or other types of
legal action.

North Carolina resident Frances Marshall endured more than two years' worth of
harassing calls from debt collectors, according to reports this month, despite
the fact that she never had any debt to begin with.

The best thing you can do if you feel you're being harassed is to file a
complaint with either the FTC, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB),
or both.

The FTC has a handy guide on what to do when debt collectors contact you,
including a full list of your rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices
Act. If you're a target, you can protect  yourself by understanding what debt
collectors are and are not allowed to do.

For example, debt collectors aren't allowed to phone you after 9 p.m. unless you
expressly tell them so. They also aren't allowed to call you at work if you tell
them not to. And no, they can't actually throw you in jail, either.

By far the biggest myth about calls and letters from debt collectors is that you
have to put up with them at all. Once you've been alerted about your past due
debt, you can ask the collector to stop contacting you, even if you haven't paid
your balance.

You just have to do it in writing. The CFPB makes that easy, with a list of
sample letters you can use to get collectors off your back. And you should keep
a log of your interactions with collectors, including copies of any letters and
emails, and notes from phone calls.

Of course, none of this will erase your debt. Once debt goes into collections,
it can stay on your credit report anywhere from five to seven years, limiting
your chances of getting approved for new credit, not to mention the heavy blow
it will deal your credit score. You can improve your odds at getting approved
for loans by settling your debts, but it's next to impossible to get them
removed once they show up on you credit report.

You can dispute debts on your credit report and get them removed if you think
they are erroneous. Check your credit report at annualcreditreport.com at least
once a year to make sure you don't have any unwarranted collections notices.
Then file a dispute using each credit bureau's dispute submission form.

State publicly names tax delinquents;
Sales Taxes

BYLINE: From wire and staff reports

SECTION: C; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 555 words


HARRISBURG - The state Revenue Department has introduced a new weapon in its
efforts to pressure delinquents to pay overdue sales taxes - public
embarrassment.

The department on Thursday posted on its Web site the names of 75 people and
businesses that owe between $11,000 and $260,000 for taxes they collected from
customers, plus interest and penalties.

Four businesses in Luzerne County are listed: Eramo Enterprises Inc., Wyoming,
$67,482; Dupont Airport Pub Inc., doing business as Damon's, $54,015; Inland
Water Sports Inc., Kingston, $38,504; and Winkies Pizza Inc., doing business as
Winkies Pizza, Sugarloaf Township, $24,992.

Revenue Secretary Gregory C. Fajt said the state has collected $3.9 million
since the department began issuing letters late last year warning their
identities would be publicly disclosed. It also has obtained agreements for
deferred payments totaling $4.3 million more.

"Every dollar that we don't collect from tax avoiders is one more dollar that we
must collect from honest taxpayers," Fajt said at a state Capitol news
conference Thursday.

The program may be expanded to include other taxes, such as the income taxes
employers withhold from employees' paychecks, cigarette taxes, corporate net
income taxes and personal income taxes, Fajt said.

"Today's event is about those people who have continued to thumb their nose at
the Department of Revenue," Fajt said. "That day is over."

Bonnie Schneck, owner of Bonnie's Flower Boutique Inc. in Allentown, said she
felt it was unfair for the state to publicize that her business had liens worth
$35,000 in Lehigh County. She said she has been making efforts to pay off what
she owes.

"I had crazy, screwed-up accountants that weren't doing the job that they were
supposed to be doing, and that's how I got into this mess to begin with,"
Schneck said. "I didn't do it intentionally, by any means."

Seventeen other states and Washington, D.C., already put the names of tax
delinquents on the Internet, Fajt said. Maryland, for example, has collected
$16.1 million since it began listing on its Web site in June 2000 the names of
people and businesses that owe sales and income taxes, penalties and interest.

The businesses and individuals on Pennsylvania's list were selected because they
are believed to still be in business. The Revenue Department has filed
courthouse liens against them since last May for the overdue taxes, interest and
penalties. Their appeal rights have expired, Fajt said.

Revenue Department letters to 973 entities that owed about $28 million yielded
full payments from 155 and deferred-payment plans for 162 others.

Fajt said 581 are not yet ready to be publicized under the department's internal
rules, but could be as the list is updated monthly.

"It's very, very important to keep in mind that every business or person on this
list has been given many, many opportunities to come forward," Fajt said.

The Revenue Department collects about $25 billion a year in taxes, including $8
billion in sales taxes.

The total amount of delinquent sales taxes is currently about $750 million, but
much of that consists of hard-to-recoup taxes from older accounts, or people who
are dead, no longer in business or living out-of-state.

Capitol: Amnesty program is estimated to generate $32 million for state;
Court clears the way for late tax payments

BYLINE: John Greiner, Capitol Bureau

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 15A

LENGTH: 389 words


The state Supreme Court paved the way Friday for a $32 million tax amnesty
program for delinquent taxpayers that begins Monday.

The tax amnesty program that runs through Nov. 14 enables Oklahomans to pay
their delinquent taxes without the normal financial penalties for late payment.

The court on Friday rejected Oklahoma City attorney Jerry Fent's lawsuit that
claimed the amnesty program violated the Oklahoma Constitution.

All nine justices agreed with the order.

Estimates are that the program will generate $32 million in revenue for the
state.

"I'm very disappointed," said Fent, who said the Oklahoma Constitution didn't
allow the state to forgive the financial penalties on taxes that are paid late.

The tax commission had disagreed with Fent's position. Fent said he will
consider asking for a rehearing after he sees the full opinion on the case.

The amnesty program was part of Gov. Brad Henry's program and a budget agreement
between him and legislative leaders.

Legislators estimated it would produce about $32 million.

Oklahoma had tax amnesty programs in 1984 and 2002.

Making a clean slate  The Clean Slate '08 program covers taxes not paid prior to
Jan. 1, 2008.

Delinquent taxpayers can receive a full waiver of financial penalties and
interest and any other collection fees due on the unpaid taxes, the tax
commission said.

Penalties will double on the unpaid taxes of those delinquent taxpayers who
don't take part in this program, the commission said.

What's covered  The amnesty program applies to the following state taxes:

Mixed beverage taxes.

Gasoline and diesel tax paid by wholesalers. This doesn't apply to motorists who
pay at the pump, the commission said.

Gross production and petroleum excise taxes on oil and natural gas.

Franchise taxes, which are paid by businesses.

Sales taxes, both local and state.

Use taxes, which are paid on out-of-state purchases for use in the state.

Income taxes, both corporate and individual.

Withholding taxes.

Bank taxes that are paid in place of an income tax.

How to learn more  Oklahomans can find more information about the Clean Slate
'08 program by going to  www.CleanSlate08.org.

On Monday a special toll-free hot line, (877) 320-7612, will be available for
state taxpayers to use to discuss their accounts and payment options with tax
commission representatives.

Mayor wants to sell liens;
 Private company could foreclose on property of tax delinquents

BYLINE: Nick Kotsopoulos; TELEGRAM & GAZETTE STAFF

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A1

LENGTH: 766 words

DATELINE: WORCESTER


Mayor Timothy P. Murray is calling on City Manager Michael V. O'Brien to
consider selling tax liens the city has against delinquent taxpayers as a way to
generate revenue, which could then be used to provide tax relief for local
property owners.

Mr. Murray said the city is owed about $10.35 million in delinquent taxes, of
which $7.5 million is property tax liens and tax-title property.

The state law enacted by the Legislature earlier this year allows municipalities
to convert these liens into revenue by selling them to private tax-lien
services. Those companies, or any other purchasers of the tax lien, then work
out a payment or refinancing plan with the owner and, if necessary, can
foreclose on the property.

Mr. Murray said he will ask the City Council tonight to request the development
of a request-for-proposal for the bulk sale of all outstanding tax liens. He
said the revenue generated from those sales can then be used to provide tax
relief to local property owners either this fiscal year or next.

"This is a proven approach," Mr. Murray said. "Property taxes fund nearly 50
percent of all city services and programs. Responsible taxpayers have been
carrying the tax burden for tax delinquents for too long. I was happy to join
many mayors from across the state in getting this legislation so municipalities
can now sell these tax liens in bulk."

The mayor said the benefit of such a program is two-fold. He said the city
receives revenues for those liens when it might not otherwise. It also gets
properties back on the tax rolls much sooner compared to the long tax-title
process.

City figures show nearly 800 properties with tax liens against them. Because of
financial and staffing issues in the city treasurer's office, Mr. Murray said,
the city is able to bring tax-title proceedings against only 50 property owners
a year.

The mayor said similar programs are being used in several other cities,
including New York, Los Angeles, Camden, N.J., Hempstead, N.Y., and Erie County,
N.Y. He said a couple of tax-lien companies are "already knocking at the door"
in Worcester.

"Responsible taxpayers who make their payments on time should not have to
continually subsidize habitual deadbeats," Mr. Murray said. "This would not only
give us a one-time revenue infusion that could help us in the short term, but it
would also benefit us in the long term because we would be getting these
properties back on the tax rolls a lot sooner."

Mr. Murray has been working with members of the City Council Municipal
Operations Committee to identify potential new revenue sources that could in
turn provide much-needed tax relief to local property owners.

The mayor intends to introduce an order at tonight's council meeting, asking the
city manager to consider applying $4 million in available additional money
against the city's tax rates. That would reduce the size of the tax increases
property owners are facing this fiscal year.

Mr. Murray said one source of that tax relief could be the $2 million Mr.
O'Brien has proposed setting aside as a health insurance reserve for next fiscal
year. He suggested the other $2 million could come from the $4.8 million the
city is receiving from the recent naming-rights deal for the DCU Center.

If that $4 million is applied against the tax rates, it would reduce everyone's
annual tax bills by about $80.

Mr. Murray said he is not certain whether Mr. O'Brien will be willing to use any
of the money for the naming-rights deal or the fiscal 2006 health insurance
reserve for tax relief at this time. He said if the manager does agree to use
those monies, they could be replaced next fiscal year by revenues generated
through the sale of tax liens.

The mayor said if the manager is reluctant to pursue such a strategy, monies
generated from the sale of tax liens could then be used to provide tax relief
next fiscal year.

The City Council will hold its annual tax classification hearing tonight, and it
is expected to adopt the traditional lowest residential tax rate ($13.26 per
$1,000 valuation) and set the tax rate for commercial and industrial property at
$27.76.

Even with the lowest residential tax rate, the annual tax bill for single-family
homeowners will go up by $140 on average. Annual property taxes for two-family
homes will rise by $293 on average, and they will go up by about $515 for
three-deckers. The new commercial-industrial tax rate, meanwhile, is expected to
increase the property taxes business owners pay by more than $190 on average.

Tax delinquents encounter varying outcomes

Who doesn't pay their taxes?

USA TODAY identified four types of people commonly named in lists of large tax
delinquents: small-business owners; doctors, lawyers and other licensed
professionals; entertainers and tax protesters.

The analysis is based on  lists published by 15 states and Washington, D.C.,
plus tax liens filed by the Internal Revenue Service. It focused on individuals
who owe at least $100,000 in taxes.

The IRS and state tax agencies are prohibited from discussing individual cases.
Amounts owed reflect public records generated by the IRS and states. Tax liens
show the amount owed when the lien was filed, so the debt could be higher or
lower today.

Small-business owners

Small-business owners are the biggest source of uncollected taxes, the IRS says.

Restaurants may use sales tax collections to cover rent, rather than pass them
on to the government as required. A construction company may make payroll first
and worry about taxes later.

Once on the slippery slope, it's hard to recover because penalties and interest
are severe.

Jim Armstrong of Marysville, Wash., sells prefabricated industrial buildings. In
2003, he delayed paying $330,000 in sales taxes, waiting for a big check at the
end of a job. The check never arrived.

"We got stiffed," he says. He expected $1 million and got $200,000 in mediation.

That money went to the tax collector, but it wasn't enough.

He now owes $404,899 in taxes, interest and penalties. The meter is running
every day. And last month, the state cleaned out two of his wife's checking
accounts.

Armstrong, 64, says he was once a millionaire. Now, he's struggling to rebuild a
business.

Washington Revenue Department spokesman Mike Gowrylow says he can't talk about a
specific case, but "we bend over backward to work with businesses."

He adds: "Remember, sales tax isn't a tax on the business. It's a tax the
business collected from someone else, kept and did not remit to the state."

Armstrong says that "I'm the first one to admit we did something we weren't
supposed to do. We've tried to repay at tremendous personal hardship."

Doctors, lawyers

Doctors, lawyers, dentists and chiropractors account for a big share of tax
delinquents -- 10% of California's list, for example.

Sometimes, tax trouble isn't the only problem delinquents face.

Neurosurgeon Lorne Houten of Woodland Hills, Calif., owes $440,000 in state
income tax and $472,406 in federal taxes, public records show. In 2002, the
Medical Board of California accused him of a series of medical errors. A
disciplinary hearing is set for September. Houten has not responded publicly to
the board.

For most, tax troubles don't signal professional problems.

Madison Richardson, a prominent head and neck specialist in Beverly Hills, owes
$1.6 million in state income taxes and $2.1 million in federal income taxes,
public records show. He maintains a large practice with two offices.

Neither physician could be reached for comment.

"You'd be surprised how many doctors don't file income tax returns," says David
MacKusick, an Atlanta tax lawyer. "They're busy, self-employed and figure
they'll get around to it later."

Celebrities

Actors, rock stars and athletes can generate huge tax debts along with their big
paychecks.

Some get into tax trouble right away. Others stumble when their careers cool.
Some score comebacks and use their next big paycheck to settle the problem.

Recent celebrity tax troubles:

*Actor Robert Downey Jr., who spent time in jail for probation violations after
offenses involving drugs and drunken driving, is tax lien-free for the first
time since 1992. The IRS removed his last lien, for $495,229, in December. He
has worked steadily since finishing probation in 2004.

*Motley Crue drummer Tommy Lee, ex-husband of actresses Pamela Anderson and
Heather Locklear, had a $214,000 IRS tax lien lifted in 2005.

*Boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr.'s IRS liens are down to $13,594 from $3.1 million in
2004. New Jersey says he owes $193,075. He made $20 million last year defeating
Oscar de la Hoya, in the top-grossing boxing match ever.

Tax protesters

Tax protesters claim they aren't required to pay income taxes for constitutional
or moral reasons.

"I keep telling (the government) there's no legal basis for the income tax, but
it falls on deaf ears," says Gordon Clark, who lives in his mother's small house
in Enfield, Conn.

Connecticut calls him the state's largest tax debtor, owing $3 million. "If you
add up what I've earned in my lifetime, I couldn't owe that," says Clark, who
has acted as his own lawyer in his battle with the IRS. "Too many people in this
country allow injustice and tyranny to continue. I am not one of those people."

Sign of the times: Number of delinquencies, forfeitures see another surge in
Hennepin Co.

BYLINE: Burl Gilyard

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 725  words


The number of properties pending forfeiture or newly tax delinquent in Hennepin
County has surged recently, another indication of the tough economic climate
right now.

At the outset of 2008, the county's preliminary numbers showed 628 properties
for which the county had sent out notices of pending forfeiture. That's up 47
percent from the 2007 number of 428 at the same time last year.

The county's early data show 10,906 newly delinquent tax parcels as of January
3. While that's up only slightly from the 2007 number of 10,698 parcels, the new
figures are up 44 percent from the same period in 2005.

"From our perspective, this is a huge crisis and I don't think crisis is too
strong a word for it, particularly in those neighborhoods where we're seeing
strong concentrations of delinquent taxes and foreclosures," said Hennepin
County Commissioner Gail Dorfman.

"I believe delinquent taxes are a lagging indicator," said Jeff Strand,
supervisor in the taxpayer services department for Hennepin County.

A lagging economic indicator confirms economic trends; a leading indicator
forecasts trends. Property taxes don't become delinquent until the year after
they're due.

While delinquent taxes and property forfeitures are different from bank
foreclosures, both are driven by economic uncertainty and tumult - and people's
inability to keep up with payments.

Even so, property owners catching up on their tax bills have reduced the January
3 data for newly delinquent parcels, according to the county.

"It's kind of a moving target," said Scott Loomer, property tax manager with
Hennepin County's property tax division. "You don't actually know if those
[properties] that are going delinquent, if they're going to end up in
forfeiture. "

Under state law, property owners have one, three or five-year redemption
periods, depending on their property, to prevent losing properties to tax
forfeiture.

"Minnesota has very remedial laws to allow delinquent taxpayers to enter into
delinquent tax payment plans," Strand said.

Actually, taxpayers lose a relatively small number of properties every year to
tax forfeiture. According to Strand, the county saw 51 properties tax-forfeited
in 2007 and 54 in 2006.

Another potential factor in climbing tax delinquency and pending forfeiture
statistics is that the total number of property parcels in Hennepin County
continues to increase, driven by population growth and new housing development.

In 2007, Loomer said that the county had 411,713 tax parcels. That's 18,568 more
parcels than the county had in 2004, an increase of 4.7 percent in a three-year
span.

At the beginning of the year, newly delinquent tax parcels represented about 2.6
percent of all parcels in Hennepin County, Loomer said. But only a small number
of those parcels are likely to actually forfeit.

"Typically, the actual forfeitures have represented a fraction of a percent,"
Loomer said.

But amid the current economic climate, many are feeling the crunch.

The Hennepin County Foreclosure Task Force issued a report in October outlining
the extent of troubling local foreclosure trends. The report noted that mortgage
foreclosure sales in Hennepin spiked 82 percent in 2006 from 2005, with a total
volume of $591 million in property foreclosures in 2006.

Strand said that in 2007, the county saw 5,668 foreclosure sales - up more than
85 percent from 2006. In 2005, Strand said the number of foreclosure sales stood
at 1,693 in Hennepin County.

In December, the Hennepin County Board of Commissioners passed a resolution
allocating $70,000 for three nonprofits to provide counseling to renters, who
may find themselves losing a place to live when their owners default. The county
had previously allocated $300,000 for foreclosure prevention counseling for
homeowners.

"We really felt we had to nip this in the bud and protect our investments in
these neighborhoods," Dorfman said. "In Minneapolis, over 60 percent of these
properties that are foreclosed are investor-owned properties, so their renters
are getting kicked out. "

Given the current economic outlook, county officials are expecting the uptick in
pending forfeitures and new tax delinquencies to continue.

"With the economy going the way it is, I'm sure we'll probably see that figure
rise," Loomer said.

"We do think that there's an end in sight, but we don't think it's anytime
soon," Dorfman said.

Tax troubles?;
Kyle council member in fight with taxing entities

BYLINE: The Free Press staff

LENGTH: 562  words


Almost a year after the Hays County government filed a civil suit against Kyle
Council Member Becky Selbera and her family for delinquent property taxes on two
Kyle properties, a trial date has yet to be set; meanwhile, the elected
official's legal residence, which belongs to her late father, too, is delinquent
, according to Hays County Tax Assessor-Collector records.

OnAug.31,2012, Hays County filed a lawsuit for the collection of delinquent
property taxes for itself, Kyle, Austin Community College (ACC), Hays County
Emergency Services District No.5, Plum Creek Water Conservation District and
Plum Creek Groundwater Districton aproperty at 501 W. Thiele, valued at $67,380,
and a second property at ME Moore, Block 1, Lot 2,3,4 and 5, valued at $14,000.

As an elected official, Selbera may "not be delinquent on any indebtedness to
the city," according to the charter, and "If any member of the council ceases to
possess any of the qualifications of office... his/her office shall, upon such
fact being determined by the council, immediately become vacant..."

Selbera and thecodefendants in the county lawsuit - Mary S. Martinez, Reynaldo
Selbera III, Hope Selbera, Olga S. Flores, Silvia Selbera and Alicia S. Reyna
-owe Kyle $805.51 in delinquent property taxes on both properties for 2011 and
2012, according to county records.

All in all, the defendants owe $4,265.60 in back property taxes on the two
properties, if paid by the end of June; that figure would jump up to $4,732.41
if it's paid by July 31.

Selbera said Tuesday she did not know any of the specifics surrounding the
lawsuit as she had relinquished ownership on the two real estate possessions to
her father before he died in March.

"I signed paperwork over to my dad, so he can handle that," Selbera said, adding
that she does not have a copy of the document nor is she aware of where her late
father may have left the piece of paper.

"All of that was being handled by my dad. My dad was basically the caretaker of
all that land," Selbera said. "Right now, my sister is handling my dad's estate.
It's an estate matter and a personal matter." This is not the first time Hays
County has had to file suit against the same defendants in efforts to collect
delinquent property taxes. The county filed a lawsuit against Selbera and her
family in the 207th District Court in Jan. 2002, before the matter was disposed
in 2004 after the county received a $567 payment, records show.

Selbera does not live in neither of the properties named in the 2012 Hays County
lawsuit against her and her family, but the property listed as her legal
residence on Kyle's municipal website-301W.Thiele-also is in property tax
delinquency.

County records show that $2,584.34 are owed in back taxes on the property listed
as Sel-bera's residence, which identifies her late-father as the owner. "I don't
know" any details surrounding these cases, Selbera said. "We're just trying to
rectify what's going on. I will be getting a lawyer."

The Hays Free Press submitted an open records request looking into all Kyle and
Buda councilmembers' property tax records from the Hays County Tax
Assessor-Collector's Office. Aside from Selbera, those documents showed that no
other elected official on either council was delinquent..

As an elected official, Selbera may "not be delinquent on any indebtedness to
the city," according to the charter.

Aug. 06--HIGH POINT -- High Point Mayor Bernita Sims owes the city hundreds of
dollars in utility bills, some of which are nearly a year past due, according to
city records.

As of Monday, the unpaid balance for electricity, water and sewer-related
charges for Sims' previous residence at 1720 Candlewood Court was $538.78. The
balance covers four billing cycles between Aug. 21, 2012, and Dec. 18, 2012. The
due dates for the unpaid bills ranged from October 2012 until Jan. 10. City
records show the delinquencies include an attempted payment of $223.46 on Nov.
30, 2012, that was returned for insufficient funds, resulting in a $25 returned
check fee.

Sims rented the property and did not own it, but the account for the utilities
serving the property was in her name.

Sims said she moved out in December 2012.

The city has tried to collect the balance since January, shutting off utility
service to the property and forwarding the account to a state program that
allows garnishment of the past due amounts from tax refunds. No payment from tax
returns has been made, according to city officials. The city's next alternative
is to refer the matter to a collection agency, which officials have not yet
done.

Sims said she is able to pay the amount due and intends to do so, but has been
unclear on whether she can still pay the city directly, since the matter has
been referred to the state.

"If the city says, 'Yes, we'll take it,' then they can have it tomorrow," Sims
said Monday.

City officials said she can still pay the city directly.

News of the delinquent account comes on the heels of other financial troubles
involving the mayor.

Sims remains under investigation by the North Carolina State Bureau of
Investigation in connection with her handling of the estate of a family member
in Maryland. SBI agents have looked into an allegation that Sims passed a
worthless $7,000 check to one of the estate's heirs, and recently expanded the
investigation to look into possible misuse and misappropriation of funds from
the estate.

Prosecutors with the North Carolina Attorney General's Office have not yet
determined whether to file charges.

The High Point Enterprise obtained email correspondence related to Sims'
delinquent city account following a public records request.

The documents show that city funds were used to pay for the airfare of one of
Sims' sisters who accompanied her to Boston for a National League of Cities
event in November 2012. The mayor serves on the NLC board of directors.

In a Jan. 31 email memo to Sims, City Manager Strib Boynton wrote that the mayor
"committed to me that your sister would reimburse the city" for her $321.70
airfare following a meeting on Jan. 25.

Boynton's memo stated that the reimbursement had not been made. The airfare
apparently was paid shortly thereafter, because, in a subsequent memo on Feb. 4,
Boynton thanked Sims for the reimbursement.

He went on to state that Sims had said payment would be made "in the next couple
of weeks on the $538.78 still remaining in past due utility bills. Would you
please let me know when we can expect the payment? I do not like this any better
than you do, however as a matter of practice this is really past the time that
we normally refer matters like this to a collection agency and to North
Carolina's Debt Setoff Clearinghouse."

In his Jan. 31 memo, Boynton advised Sims that one alternative would be to refer
the matter to the City Council "for their review, guidance and consideration."

In the same memo, he wrote, "My staff has tried to help and work with you, but
unresolved, this matter has left my staff and me in an untenable and
unsustainable position."

PRIVATIZING BOOT CAMPS;
Can we afford to teach delinquents a lesson?

BYLINE: JEFF DICKERSON

SECTION: EDITORIAL; Pg. 06A

LENGTH: 581 words


The state Senate last week easily passed Sen. David Scott's (D- Atlanta) bill
mandating boot camp sentences for first-time violent juvenile offenders.

Boot camps are the popular, polar opposites of the lazy and undisciplined
streets that produce these young toughs: On the streets they strut and slouch;
in boot camps they stand straight at attention, follow orders instantly, make
their bunks perfectly, shine their boots brightly ---all after getting their
cool hairdos shaved. The delinquents work, and they go to school.

Many get their first real dose of structure: They know what's expected of them,
and when they accomplish it, they feel good about themselves. Boot camps,
followed with essential after-care in a group home setting, will steer some from
a life of crime. That will save tax dollars and lives ---the kids' and their
victims'.

State legislators are for sending more young delinquents to boot camps, and li
ke the Senate, the state House is likely to approve this new bill.

But voting for boot camps is one thing; funding them is another. Is there a way
to create more boot camp bunks without hiring hundreds of new state workers and
building new state-owned facilities?

There is, and the model is nestled in rural Irwin County. Surrounded by peanut
farmers and pecan groves is the Irwin Youth Detention Campus. The boot camp is
owned and operated by BRG of Georgia Inc., which contracted with Irwin County
after the company's plans to attract federal prisoners fell through.

The boot camp is a near-perfect example of public and private sectors working
together in what's called "privatization."

The drill sergeants in their imposing black uniforms are not state workers but
employees of BRG. The state requires that the 300 or so delinquents attend
school 300 minutes a day. The teachers are brought in under contract, not at $
82,000 in salary and benefits as was the case with some state teachers in the
Corrections Department. The boot camp employs a chaplain; he, too, is a private
employee.

The standards by which the camp operates, however, are the state's. And BRG is
quick to meet and exceed them to keep its client happy.

The beauty of this arrangement is that the state need not build new facilities
or guarantee lifetime benefits and retirement to new state employees in order to
teach a few more delinquents a lesson. If in five or 10 years the number of
Georgia delinquents declines, as everyone hopes, the state isn't stuck with idle
drill sergeants and empty boot camp bunks. While the private owners are betting
that they'll get a steady, profitable supply of delinquents, the risk will be
theirs.

The cost to taxpayers is far less ---about $ 16 less per inmate per day ---at
Irwin than at state-operated YDCs.

And Irwin Countians love it because it provides jobs. "A lot of counties don't
want prisons," says W. David McCranie, the Irwin County Commission chairman.
"But it's been a positive experience for us." The delinquents even show off
their marching skills in the county's annual Sweet Potato Festival.

As the number of young males raised without fathers continues to grow, so does
the number of delinquents. If we don't teach them crime doesn't pay, they'll
figure it does. Right now we can't afford to teach all violent youths that
lesson. Scott's bill ensures that we do, and privatization can help make it
happen.

Jeff Dickerson is a member of the Journal editorial board. His column appears on
Tuesday.

Tax troubles?;
Kyle council member in fight with taxing entities

BYLINE: The Free Press staff

LENGTH: 562  words


Almost a year after the Hays County government filed a civil suit against Kyle
Council Member Becky Selbera and her family for delinquent property taxes on two
Kyle properties, a trial date has yet to be set; meanwhile, the elected
official's legal residence, which belongs to her late father, too, is delinquent
, according to Hays County Tax Assessor-Collector records.

OnAug.31, 2012, Hays County filed a lawsuit for the collection of delinquent
property taxes for itself, Kyle, Austin Community College (ACC), Hays County
Emergency Services District No.5, Plum Creek Water Conservation District and
Plum Creek Groundwater Districton a property at 501 W. Thiele, valued at
$67,380, and a second property at ME Moore, Block 1, Lot 2,3,4 and 5, valued at
$14,000.

As an elected official, Selbera may "not be delinquent on any indebtedness to
the city," according to the charter, and "If any member of the council ceases to
possess any of the qualifications of office... his/her office shall, upon such
fact being determined by the council, immediately become vacant..."

Selbera and thecodefendants in the county lawsuit - Mary S. Martinez, Reynaldo
Selbera III, Hope Selbera, Olga S. Flores, Silvia Selbera and Alicia S. Reyna
-owe Kyle $805.51 in delinquent property taxes on both properties for 2011 and
2012, according to county records.

All in all, the defendants owe $4,265.60 in back property taxes on the two
properties, if paid by the end of June; that figure would jump up to $4,732.41
if it's paid by July 31.

Selbera said Tuesday she did not know any of the specifics surrounding the
lawsuit as she had relinquished ownership on the two real estate possessions to
her father before he died in March.

"I signed paperwork over to my dad, so he can handle that," Selbera said, adding
that she does not have a copy of the document nor is she aware of where her late
father may have left the piece of paper.

"All of that was being handled by my dad. My dad was basically the caretaker of
all that land," Selbera said. "Right now, my sister is handling my dad's estate.
It's an estate matter and a personal matter." This is not the first time Hays
County has had to file suit against the same defendants in efforts to collect
delinquent property taxes. The county filed a lawsuit against Selbera and her
family in the 207th District Court in Jan. 2002, before the matter was disposed
in 2004 after the county received a $567 payment, records show.

Selbera does not live in neither of the properties named in the 2012 Hays County
lawsuit against her and her family, but the property listed as her legal
residence on Kyle's municipal website-301W.Thiele-also is in property tax
delinquency.

County records show that $2,584.34 are owed in back taxes on the property listed
as Sel-bera's residence, which identifies her late-father as the owner. "I don't
know" any details surrounding these cases, Selbera said. "We're just trying to
rectify what's going on. I will be getting a lawyer."

The Hays Free Press submitted an open records request looking into all Kyle and
Buda councilmembers' properly tax records from the Hays County Tax
Assessor-Collector's Office. Aside from Selbera, those documents showed that no
other elected official on either council was delinquent..

As an elected official, Selbera may "not be delinquent on any indebtedness to
the city," according to the charter.

Delinquent property taxes rising

BYLINE: MICHAEL SCHMIDT TH staff writer * mschmidt@wcinet.com

SECTION: A; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 468 words


how much are they owed? A county-by-county look at the number of tax-delinquent
properties. Dubuque County: 916 properties, $1,036,636 owed Jackson County: 356
properties, $351,148 owed Clayton County: 373 properties, $281,731 owed tax
sales set The tax sales will be held at 9 a.m. Monday, June 15, at the
courthouses of Dubuque, Jackson and Clayton counties.

It has become a ritual for Dubuque County Treasurer Eric Stierman. Every year,
around the middle of June, Stierman has to play the role of property tax
collector. "Why didn't they pay them? I can't tell you," Stierman said. "I get
calls from different people, but I also get the same calls from the same people
every year." Property owners late on their payments are on the rise in the
tri-state area, as county treasurers scurry to prepare for the annual tax sale.
The sale will be Monday, June 15, at the courthouses of Dubuque, Jackson and
Clayton counties. A large number of buyers are expected at the respective sales,
which bid out the properties with delinquent taxes. The bidding process is
conducted through a lottery system. Stierman sends property owners tax bills
starting in January and delinquent notices in May. "The idea is not to shame
people," Stierman said. "The reason is to let people know (about delinquent
taxes)." Dubuque County has 916 delinquent properties up for sale this year, an
increase of 69 properties from 2008. Also, the amount owed to the county has
jumped $269,115 in the past year. "Obviously, the economy is hurting," Stierman
said. Clayton County typically has 60 to 65 investors at its tax sale, which
lasts around two hours, said county treasurer Linda Orr. Orr said most property
owners pay after the county sends the delinquent notice. "I haven't heard the
reasons why people aren't paying taxes, so I suppose (the recession) would
factor in," Orr said. "But they still have time to pay in. "We usually get a lot
of (taxes paid) in the last couple of days." Grant County, Wis., had a tax sale
in the spring, with taxes of one delinquent property in Cuba City on the block,
said county treasurer Louise Ketterer. Two other properties are on Ketterer's
list for the county's upcoming tax sale. The date hasn't been set. "We're up a
tiny bit, but it's a not a major issue with the county at this time," Ketterer
said. "However, I do foresee maybe a trickle down eventually with job layoffs.
"Within the next year, we will see the real effect." Ketterer said Grant County
will not take possession of any property, instead working with owners on a
payment schedule. "We're really good at working with people. We're open, and we
will take any payment amount," Ketterer said. Jo Daviess (Ill.) County holds its
tax sale in October. Tax bills will be sent out next week, said Jo Daviess
County Treasurer Carol Soat.

Unpaid utilities added to tax bills

BYLINE: Sharahn D. Boykin, Springfield News-Sun, Ohio

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 413 words


Aug. 24--YELLOW SPRINGS -- Delinquent utility bills will now be added to Yellow
Springs homeowners' property taxes.

The village will be collecting nearly $7,300 in unpaid utility bills from four
homeowners whose bills date back to 2006.

The village will mail a certified letter to these homeowners giving them a final
opportunity to pay before adding the amount to their tax bills. If they don't
pay before the delinquent amount is added to their property taxes, the money
will be collected by the Greene County auditor, along with a 10 percent
assessment fee.

"This (the resolution) will take effect immediately," said Yellow Springs
council president Karen Wintrow of the measure, which was unanimously approved
last week.

The village will receive half of about $730 in assessment fees that will be
billed to the homeowners. The county auditor will receive the other half.

Delinquent utility accounts, including water, sewer and solid waste, result in
an estimated $22,000 annual revenue loss to village, according to village
documents. Over an eight-year period starting in 2006, these delinquent accounts
totaled more than $190,000.

Delinquent utility payments could lead to increased utility rates for all
village residents, Yellow Springs Village Manager Patti Bates has said
previously.

Overall, past-due utility accounts associated with owner-occupied homes account
for a small percentage of village residents with delinquent utility accounts,
according to village data.

Most of the delinquent accounts, about 75 percent, belong to renters who move
out of the area.

In a report, Yellow Springs Finance Director Melissa Vanzant attributed the
delinquent accounts to deaths, foreclosures, bankruptcies, abandoned homes,
contractors using temporary utilities who leave town and renters who move out of
town leaving balances on their accounts.

The legislation is one of several measures the council is considering to collect
unpaid utility bills.

In addition to adding the delinquent bills to a homeowner's tax bill, Vanzant
has also suggested the village require that all utilities customers pay a
deposit.

Currently, village homeowners are exempted from paying a utility deposit. She
also suggested the village keep utility deposits until a customer pays the final
bill instead of the current practice of returning the deposit after two years.

Growing list of properties behind in taxes

BYLINE: DOUG SWORD and MICHAEL BRAGA Staff writers

SECTION: D; ARTICLE; Pg. D10

LENGTH: 693 words


List of delinquent real estate is an indication of just how badly economics of
commercial property is deteriorating

THERE ARE A NUMBER OF WAYS to assess a commercial property's value, the main
ones being the sale prices of comparable properties and how much income is
generated.

Until a couple of years ago, owners invariably opted for the comparable price
method, said Bill Furst, Sarasota County's property appraiser. That was simply
good sense, because property values were going up faster than could be tracked
by a once-a-year tax assessment based on sales made the previous year.

But nowadays, businesses are readily telling assessors about their income, and
how much it is down, Furst said. That is because lower income can translate into
a lower tax assessment.

It is not just that vacancy rates are up and rents are down as tenants shop for,
and get, rent reductions. But rent collection losses are up as well.

"The rent may be down, but even that doesn't mean people are paying it," Furst
says.

The economics of commercial real estate are deteriorating at the same time that
property owners' loans are resetting Real estate experts worry that since
commercial loans are usually just five to seven years long, those that must
refinance in the midst of a recession will have a difficult time convincing
lenders that their property's income can service the loan.

Hints of these problems may be found on a couple of lists: Commercial property
owners who are delinquent on their property taxes, and, of course, those whose
lenders have actually filed foreclosure proceedings.

A record $58 million in property taxes were delinquent last year in Sarasota
County. That fell to $51 million for the tax bill due March 30, but practically
all of that decline was the result of lower assessments and lower taxes for
local governments.

The delinquency rate remained virtually the same: 6.9 percent last year and 6.7
percent this year. Taxes are delinquent this year on one out of every 13
properties. Three years ago, the delinquency rate was one out of every 18
properties.

The lion's share are on residential properties, but the big ones are almost all
on commercial properties.

Several property owners are showing up on the list for the second year in a row.

Repeaters on the top 10 list are Gran Paradiso developers in Thomas Ranch, whose
two years of missed payments now top $9 million; Lee Wetherington Development;
Marsh Creek Holdings; and Founders Club Development.

A number of property owners who missed the tax deadline can also be found on the
list of those whose banks moved to foreclose earlier this year.

The biggest in Sarasota County is MPL Lodgings, which owes $93,000 in taxes on
its Holiday Inn Express property on U.S. 41 south of Siesta Key, and owes $7.9
million in a foreclosure action filed in February. Others showing up on both
lists include: Waterford Waterfront Building C LLC, Living Life Enterprises,
Siesta Key Storage and Scaffolding Manufacturing.

The connection is not particularly surprising. After his company missed the tax
deadline last year, developer Lee Wetherington speculated that property owners
were holding off on paying their taxes until they could secure financing.

"I'm guessing their thinking is, 'Why pay the taxes if they're still negotiating
with the banks?'" he said at the time.

Many businesses that miss the tax deadline later pay the taxes or redeem the tax
certificates that are sold to investors who step in to pay unpaid taxes. But
missing a tax payment can be an indicator for some that bigger troubles are
ahead.

For instance, both MPL Lodgings and Waterford Waterfront Building C missed the
tax deadline in 2009 and by early this year both had lis pendens filed against
their properties.

Nevada CUs Score Legislative Wins, Including 'Super Priority Liens'

BYLINE: Michael Bartlett

SECTION: GENERAL NEWS Vol. 1 No. 1

LENGTH: 679  words


CARSON CITY, Nev. - The Nevada Credit Union League said it helped support and
defeat several bills in the Nevada legislature that would have affected credit
unions in the Silver State.

The headliner was Senate Bill 306, which was authored by Sens. Scott Hammond
(R-Las Vegas) and Minority Leader Aaron Ford (D-Las Vegas). The bill will remedy
a situation in which home owners associationsexercised their "super priority
lien" statusin Nevada to foreclose on homes to collect unpaid HOA dues - in some
cases wiping out hundreds of thousands of dollars in loans without giving notice
to lenders.

The Nevada CU League supported SB 306, noting it was engaged for several months
in negotiating a compromise with stakeholders, including homeowners
associations, realtors, banks and other mortgage lenders.

SB 306 will make sure HOAs notify lien holders of delinquent HOA assessments on
the homes, allowing credit unions and other lenders to remedy the delinquent HOA
dues and avoid a foreclosure sale. The bill specifically requires HOAs to
provide credit unions with notices when a homeowner is behind on his or her HOA
assessments upon notice of default and election to sell, all prior to executing
a foreclosure sale. It also offers lien holders and homeowners a redemption
period to recover the property if the delinquent assessments are not paid prior
to a foreclosure sale.

Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval signed SB 306 into law.

The Nevada legislature meets every two years. With the close of the 2015 session
this week, the next session will be held in 2017.

Read My Lips: No New Taxes

Another key development from this session is Gov. Sandoval passed his new
revenue package to fund education in Nevada. The NCUL said the bill exempts
Nevada's credit unions from the modified business tax and commerce tax, and
keeps Nevada's credit unions' business license fee at $200. This bill will raise
millions of dollars for educational programs and those assisting children and
seniors living in poverty, as well as other at-risk groups.

The Nevada CU League hailed the defeat of Senate Bill 260 and Assembly Bill 240,
which would have required credit unions to impound HOA dues in escrow accounts
for all new home loans in a homeowners association, and pay HOA dues through
those accounts.

The legislature passed Senate Bill 512, putting a two-year sunset on the
foreclosure mediation program, which would end the program in 2017.

The Nevada CU League said it was successful in amending AB 175 to add
transparency for consumers who drive for transportation network companies, such
as UBER and Lyft, by requiring an additional disclosure alerting them to the
fact that their car is at-risk. The company must to disclose to its drivers, in
writing, that their personal automobile insurance contract may not cover
physical damage done to their vehicles while they are providing services. AB 175
would additionally require drivers - with UBER, Lyft or a similar company - with
a lien on their vehicle, to notify the lienholder they are using their vehicles
to provide these services. AB 176 created a system for transportation network
companies to be regulated by the Nevada Transportation Authority.

"This session showed credit union advocacy at its finest, with credit unions and
the League doing a fantastic job during a very challenging and intense
legislative session," Wally Murray, chairman of the Nevada CU League and CEO of
Greater Nevada Credit Union in Carson City, said in a statement. "Our member
credit unions stepped up at critical points during this session to make sure
legislators are aware of our positions on key issues."

Wayne Tew, CEO of Clark County Credit Union in Las Vegas, said the legislative
session, "was one of the most active I have observed. The proactive involvement
of credit union CEOs, management teams, advocates, and League representatives
was critical in accomplishment of credit union objectives this year."

Tew added: "I encourage all Nevada credit unions to remain politically active so
we can maintain our strong relationships with those in elected office."

Amnesty offered on back taxes County to seek lost revenue by giving delinquents
a break

BYLINE: By Gary Hendricks STAFF WRITER

SECTION: EXTRA; Section I; Page 1

LENGTH: 366 words


Clayton County officials are hoping to lure an extra $ 1 million or $ 2 million
into the treasury by offering amnesty to people who owe back property taxes.

The $ 12.5 million currently owed the county amounts to about 15 percent of the
money it takes to operate county government for a year.

"Hopefully it'll generate a couple of million for us," said Commission Chairman
Crandle Bray, who has pushed for such an amnesty program. "It's a unique program
the Legislature gave us."

Clayton is the first local jurisdiction to take advantage of the program, which
became law in April, county officials said.

Every year, the County Commission anticipates collecting $ 500,000 to $ 1
million in back taxes. The revenues from the amnesty program would be in
addition to regular back tax collections.

However, Bray noted that if the amnesty produces a boon this year, the
delinquent collections likely will fall off the following year. "We'll already
have it," he said.

One delinquent taxpayer not expected to participate is the city of Atlanta,
which owes Clayton about $ 3 million on property acquired in airport noise
buyout programs. Atlanta and Clayton are disputing in court whether the city
really owes the county.

For taxpayers owing the remaining $ 9.5 million, the amnesty window would open
July 15 and close Sept. 16 - a 60-day period.

The program works this way: The county forgives the entire 10 percent flat
penalty charge for being delinquent and eliminates half the 12 percent interest
that accrues monthly on the outstanding principal.

The issue of uncollected taxes was used against Tax Commissioner Pat Hussey in
the 1992 election when opponents charged that delinquent taxes amounted to $ 23
million.

Hussey, who is in her first term as tax commissioner but worked in the office
for 18 years, countered that Clayton had an aggressive back- tax collection
program. She produced figures showing the county was collecting back taxes and
won the election.

Counties can sell the property of delinquent taxpayers on the courthouse steps.
However, that tactic does not work if the property has been abandoned or the
land is deemed unworthy of development, Hussey said.

'Man up,' Rendell tells state lawmakers

BYLINE: Mike Wereschagin

LENGTH: 563 words


Gov. Ed Rendell on Tuesday told state lawmakers to "man up" and vote for tax and
fee increases he proposed to plug about $1.7 billion in upcoming budget
deficits.

Politicians' worries about losing their jobs over a tax increase are overblown,
Rendell said during a visit to Pittsburgh. He spoke Downtown at the kick-off of
a statewide tour aimed at persuading tax delinquents to pay up by a June 18 tax
amnesty deadline. The 54-day amnesty program eliminates penalties and half of
the interest charged on back taxes.

The amnesty program, created to boost flagging revenue, enticed 37,500
delinquents to pay $101 million so far, with a goal of $190 million. Those who
don't pay will face stepped-up enforcement and another 5 percent in penalties.
The state will post their names on its website. The state spent more than $3
million to advertise the program.

Department of Revenue records show about $2.1 billion in back taxes dating to
the 1920s, said spokeswoman Stephanie Weyant. State law bars the department from
writing off delinquent accounts even if someone dies or a delinquent company
goes out of business, she said.

But even if the state hits the $190 million goal, it won't be nearly enough to
solve budget problems, which is why Rendell pitched new taxes on natural gas
extraction and cigars and smokeless tobacco. He wants to eliminate a loophole
that gives companies a 1 percent discount for remitting sales tax to the state
early, since computers have reduced a once-tedious accounting task to a few
keystrokes and wire transfer.

Together, these changes would generate more than $300 million to cut into the
projected $1.3 billion deficit next year, Rendell said. Another $320 million
could come from increasing vehicle registration and driver's license fees to
keep up with inflation, he said. That money would help make up for $417 million
in transportation funding the state hoped to generate by placing tolls on
Interstate 80, an idea the federal government rejected.

"Not one incumbent who voted for (the 2003 income tax hike) lost," Rendell said.
When he ran for re-election three years later, "I was elected by a margin of
almost 22 percent, probably the largest (margin) in modern history in
Pennsylvania. So, man up."

As the June 30 budget deadline draws closer, the political caucuses remain in
disagreement over Rendell's proposals, according to spokespeople. House
Democrats say the state needs more money. Senate Republicans remain cool to
Rendell's proposals. House GOP leaders are willing to discuss registration and
license fee increases but oppose non-transportation-related taxes.

"To liberals, supporting higher taxes and taking more money out of the people's
pockets seems to be a badge of courage," said House Republican spokesman Stephen
Miskin. "In reality, tough decisions come with living within your means like
every family does, paying with money you actually have like every family does."

Dozens of anti-tax protesters visited Capitol offices yesterday -- another sign
of the anti-incumbent mood every House member and half the state's senators will
face in November's election. Thomas Altman, 59, an investor from Hempfield who
founded Pennsylvania Freedom Allies, stopped by the office of Rep. James
Roebuck, D-Philadelphia, after the statehouse rally.

"We need him to protect us from the governor," Altman told Roebuck's secretary.

Total delinquent Erie garbage bills: nearly $2.5 million -- and counting

BYLINE: Kevin Flowers, Erie Times-News, Pa.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 1378 words


Jan. 19--Every three months, Erie's Joe Koehle pays his garbage bill.

Koehle, co-coordinator of the East Bayfront Neighborhood Watch, said he expects
others to do the same, on time, even after the city increased garbage fees by
nearly 15 percent to help balance its 2014 budget.

When people don't pay, Koehle said, the city of Erie should aggressively go
after that delinquent revenue -- especially when those overdue bills represent
millions of dollars.

"I just don't understand why in this day and age it's so hard to collect this
money," said Koehle, 55, who lives in the 200 block of East Second Street.

Koehle said he follows the issue because many delinquent customers are landlords
with multiple rental properties in his and other city neighborhoods.

"This has been going on for a long time and the city has had years to work on
this issue," Koehle continued. "The people who aren't paying are making a
conscious decision not to pay, while the rest of us pay our bills. That part is
galling to me."

The Erie Times-News examined the issue of delinquent garbage fees in 2010. At
that time, overdue garbage payments and penalties totaled $1.16 million,
according to Erie Water Works, which took over billing for the city in 2006.

As of Dec. 31, that total was nearly $1.6 million, according to the Water Works,
which means overdue payments/penalties have increased 38 percent since 2010.

Further, when you include municipal liens totaling more than $930,000 filed
against scores of other delinquent customers/accounts, the total delinquency
amount swells to about $2.5 million, said Paul Vojtek, the Erie Water Works'
chief executive.

Many of the overdue accounts go back more than a decade, with many individual
customers owing thousands of dollars each. In one case, Water Works records
show, a customer owes more than $26,000 on multiple rental properties.

Exploring options

Erie City Councilwoman Jessica Horan-Kunco said neither council nor Mayor Joe
Sinnott's administration has done enough in recent years to curb the
delinquencies -- and that needs to change in 2014.

Horan-Kunco is the new chairwoman of council's Finance Committee. She said
finding solutions to the garbage delinquencies is a top City Council priority.

The issue will likely be the top agenda item at council's first Finance
Committee meeting of the year on Feb. 5.

"We have to do the research on what options are available to us with the
delinquent bills, from a legal standpoint," Horan-Kunco said. "What have other
municipalities experienced? What has worked elsewhere?"

"There wasn't more of a push to do it before because it's work. It's not going
to be a quick fix," Horan-Kunco said. "But we know doing it the way we've been
doing it is not effective, and not an answer."

Horan-Kunco said she wants to explore options like hiring a collection agency to
go after the delinquent revenue and rolling garbage payments into a property
owners' yearly tax bill.

Sinnott said he is willing to work with City Council on the issue. In a previous
interview, Sinnott said the city could soon launch a searchable database of
delinquent garbage customers on its website, www.erie.pa.us.

But Sinnott also believes the city's options are limited. He said other cities
wrestle with the same issue, including Scranton, which is trying to collect
nearly $8 million in overdue garbage bills.

"Ultimately the lien is the mechanism we have right now," Sinnott said. "In an
ideal world, everybody pays on time ... but until the law changes, that's what
we have to deal with."

Erie Water Works has filed liens against delinquent garbage customers since
2006. Liens are filed after multiple notices are sent to property owners, and
when the overdue bill is at least one year old.If the property is sold, the lien
allows the city to collect its money from the proceeds.

Asked why he believes the problem persists, Vojtek said: "One of the factors is
that other than liens, there is really no recourse for the city to address
delinquencies for the garbage.

"Unlike water and sewer, where water can be turned off to encourage people to
pay overdue bills, you can't do that with garbage," Vojtek said.

Vojtek also pointed out that city officials, citing health concerns, have said
the city will not stop picking up garbage if an account is delinquent.

'We're stuck'

At least one local landlord also wants to see changes -- because he believes
landlords are often scapegoats when it comes to the issue of garbage
delinquencies.

"In our leases, our tenants are supposed to pay those bills," said Ray
Wasielewski, co-owner of Raymac Inc. and Guvno Inc., two businesses that manage
more than 50 rental units in the city, most of them on the city's lower east
side.

According to Erie Water Works' records, Raymac's overdue garbage accounts total
$17,645 and involve multiple properties. The overdue refuse bills for Guvno are
even higher: $26,626, also for multiple addresses.

"What happens with tenants is sometimes they pay what they can and have to in
order to keep their utilities on, and let other bills skate," Wasielewski said.
"Then they move out, or I evict them, and we're stuck with this unpaid bill."

Wasielewski said he and his business partner, Erie lawyer David Mack, pay what
they can on the delinquent accounts. They have also mailed letters to their
tenants in recent weeks, asking them to pay their garbage bills "because the
city is going to start cracking down," Wasielewski said.

Wasielewski said the situation "almost makes it not even worth being a landlord
anymore. What it comes down to is the bills get so big, it's difficult to catch
up."

Some local elected officials have also found that to be true.

Both Erie School Board member Mary Frances Schenley and Erie County Councilman
Andre Horton have delinquent garbage accounts, according to Erie Water Works'
records.

Schenley owes $1,098 for her home in the 2600 block of Jackson Avenue, according
to Water Works records. Horton, elected to County Council in November, owes
$1,736 for a house he owns in the 300 block of Reed Street, records show.

Schenley said she filed for bankruptcy a few years ago. As a school board member
who deals directly with property taxes, Schenley said, she made keeping her own
taxes current her first priority.

"If something else fell by the wayside, that was my second priority," said
Schenley, who said she has made arrangements to pay her garbage bills. "They are
(my) priority now, and I think my priorities are straight."

Horton also said he experienced financial difficulty that contributed to his
overdue bills. Both Horton and Water Works officials said Horton is on a payment
arrangement.

"I take full responsibility and I would encourage anyone else to go down and
make financial arrangements as well," Horton said.

Fee increases

The average city resident saw garbage fees rise for 2014 from an average of $48
every three months, or $192 per year, to $55 every quarter, or $220 per year.

Sewer fees were also increased; the fee hikes generated $3.1 million in revenue
for the city.

The city's Bureau of Refuse and Recycling is budgeted at $7.4 million for 2014,
funded by residents' garbage fees. The city paid Erie Water Works $413,000 to
handle billing and collections for both sewer and garbage fees, Vojtek said.

Sinnott said the increase, the first in four years, was necessary to keep up
with rising employee costs and increased landfill tipping fees.

When City Council approved the 2014 budget, it included what's known as a sunset
provision on the garbage fee increase.

Horan-Kunco and other council members said it was intended to push Sinnott's
administration, council and other city officials to work collaboratively to find
solutions to the delinquencies.

Erie's Norm Lasky, 75, hopes to see that happen. The Eliot Street resident said
city officials should either "privatize the garbage (collection), or make it a
tax.

"Add the $220 a year to my tax bill and get on with it," Lasky said. "Then if I
don't pay, my house goes to a tax sale and I could lose my property. This is
ridiculous."

FORECLOSURE RATE CLIMBS

BYLINE: JEFF HARRINGTON, Times Staff Writer

SECTION: TAMPA BAY; Pg. 4B

LENGTH: 484 words



HIGHLIGHT: As of June, about one in five bay area homeowners was seriously
behind on mortgage payments.


The percentage of Tampa Bay homeowners seriously delinquent on their mortgages
rose at the third-fastest rate in the country over the past year, indicating the
foreclosure tidal wave isn't subsiding yet.

About 19.6 percent of bay area homeowners - roughly one in five - were either
90-plus days delinquent in their mortgage or in foreclosure as of June,
according to an analysis released Tuesday. That's up from 15.7 percent in June
2009.

That rate of growth in Tampa Bay's foreclosure pipeline trails only Las Vegas
and Miami-Fort Lauderdale out of 366 metro areas tracked in the report.

The Foreclosure-Response.org analysis was done in collaboration by three groups:
Local Initiatives Support Corp., the Urban Institute and the Center for Housing
Policy. Their conclusions, at least with respect to Tampa Bay and Florida, were
not encouraging:

- Nine out of the top 10 and 15 out of the top 25 metro areas with the highest
serious delinquency rates in June were in Florida.

- Of the 25 metro areas with the biggest growth in serious delinquency rates
over the year, 11 were in Florida.

- In the Miami metro area - the area with the highest serious delinquency rate -
25.6 percent of mortgages were seriously delinquent in June, up 4.3 percentage
points over the year. Tampa's delinquency rate was eighth highest in the
country.

"This suggests that foreclosure problems in Florida have not yet stabilized,"
the report concluded.

All told, some 400,000 foreclosure cases are pending statewide.

Florida has been slower than many states in working through its foreclosure
backlog in part because state law allows a lengthy court procedure.

The new report is pegged to June numbers, so it does not reflect a late summer
improvement.

In August, Florida showed signs of working through its problems with fewer new
foreclosure filings and a jump in bank takebacks, the final foreclosure step.

The state's foreclosure courts got bogged down this fall, however, amid an
inquiry into whether attorneys working for banks filed faulty and fraudulent
foreclosure documents.

The robo-signing controversy spurred some lenders to impose a temporary
moratorium on moving foreclosures through the court while simultaneously
prompting judges and homeowners' attorneys to scrutinize paperwork more closely
looking for errors.

OWE PA. TAXES? READ ALL ABOUT IT ONLINE

BYLINE: TOM BARNES, PITTSBURGH POST-GAZETTE

SECTION: STATE; Pg. B-1

LENGTH: 272 words


HARRISBURG -- If offering a break on penalties and interest didn't help, maybe
publishing the remaining list of 39,000 state tax scofflaws will.

State Revenue Department officials announced Monday that they would put on the
Revenue website a newly expanded list that details more than 39,000 state tax
liens against individuals and businesses. The scofflaws owe the state a total of
$233 million.

A two-month amnesty program that ended in June brought in $261 million in unpaid
taxes, which was about $70 million more than expected.

"Before tax amnesty ended in June, we promised to step up enforcement efforts
against anyone who did not take advantage of that generous -- yet limited-time
-- offer to settle back taxes without having to pay all the penalties and
interest," Revenue Secretary C. Daniel Hassell said.

"Our exhaustive online list, naming tens of thousands of tax delinquents across
the state, is the first step in fulfilling that pledge to pursue unpaid state
taxes even more aggressively."

While Pennsylvania began putting scofflaws' names online in 2006, this expanded
list has more than 10 times the number of delinquents who were contained in
previous versions. The new list will be updated monthly rather than quarterly to
add new liens and remove those who have paid.

Using the Internet to collect delinquent taxes isn't a new idea, considering
about half the states -- including New York, Virginia, Delaware and Maryland --
already do it.

To see if your name is on the list, go to www.revenue.state.pa.us and look at
the Hot Topics tab on the home page. To arrange a payment, call the Revenue
Department at 1-717-783-3000.

City 'works' with deadbeat dads

BYLINE: Carl Campanile

SECTION: Sports+Late City Final; Pg. 4

LENGTH: 412 words


The city is using kid gloves to get an estimated 295,000 deadbeat parents,
mostly dads, to pay up on child support - by helping them find jobs.

"It's better for everyone, especially the child, if a parent who owes child
support has a job and can both pay the support and be involved in the child's
life," said city Human Resources Administration spokesman David Neudstadt.

His agency works with Family Court to enforce child-support collections, but is
hiring contractors to help find jobs for the parents, many of whom have been
incarcerated and are unemployed.

"Many [noncustodial parents] are willing to meet their child-support
obligations, but lack the education, training, work experience, or job-seeking
skills to find stable employment," the HRA said in a solicitation to bidders.

Child-support delinquents paid less than half of their ­court-ordered payments
last year, a city report reveals. The average amount among the billions of
dollars owed was $17,754.

The Cuomo administration collected more than $135 million statewide last year -
including $59.4 million from New York City's delinquent parents - by garnering a
portion of tax refunds and unemployment benefits, capturing lottery winnings,
seizing property and even denying passports.

The state can also yank the driver's licenses of delinquent dads. But tough love
goes only so far.

So with the city collection rate for court-ordered child support - including
those in arrears - at just 42 percent, the de Blasio administration is turning
to the softer approach, which was begun by then-Mayor Mike Bloomberg.

The HRA has experimented with other incentives. Under its Pay it Off program,
delinquent parents who pay at least $2,500 of their debt receive a matching
payment from the HRA. The agency also waives interest charges for full payment
of principal.

Westchester Republican County Executive Rob Astorino has started a similar
program.

He forgives 25 percent of the debt if delinquent parents hold a job for at least
three months, and another 25 percent of the debt if they make 12 consecutive
monthly child-support payments.

"You need to give these parents an opportunity to correct their problems,"
Astorino said.

295,000 New York City parents have paid less than 50 percent of their
courtordered child support obligations:

n Average owed: $17,754

n Collection rate: 42%

Sewer Authority Hires Portnoff Law Associates

SECTION: CCR - DEALS & PRICING Vol. 1 No. 1

LENGTH: 200  words


The Scott Township Sewer Authority near Scranton, Pa. this week approved a
contract with Portnoff Law Associates LTD to pursue an estimated $135,000 in
unpaid monthly sewer bills. Delinquent residents will be charged additional fees
and could lose their properties in a public auction.Since the sewer system was
installed in 2011, the amount of delinquent accounts has soared, from an
estimated 80 to 128. Portnoff's seven-step collection process starts with a
notice of delinquency and ends with a sheriff's sale. Approximately 130 accounts
are delinquent, with some landowners not having paid the $87.91 monthly sewer
bill since December 2011, when billing started, Michael Giannetta, a supervisor
and sewer authority member, told the Scranton Times-Tribune.Portnoff's
collection work doesn't cost the authority anything and has been delayed since
approval in January as authority members negotiated the collection and legal
fees the agency will charge delinquent property owners. Approved in the rate
resolution, fees charged to property owners for different steps of the
collection process include $160 to send the first demand letter, $250 to file a
lien and $800 to prepare a writ of execution.

Starwood Waypoint Buys Delinquent Loan Pool for $73.3 Million

SECTION: REO Vol. 1 No. 1

LENGTH: 159  words


Starwood Waypoint Residential Trust has purchased a pool of delinquent loans and
bank-owned homes for a total price of $73.3 million.

The transaction consists of 430 nonperforming loans and 81 REO properties, the
Oakland, Calif.-based owner of single-family homes said in a press release.

The nonperforming loans were bought for $58.7 million, which represents
approximately 70% of the estimated broker price opinion value of $84.4 million,
the company said on Wednesday.

During the third quarter, the company invested $309 million to acquire four
pools that consisted of 1,800 delinquent loans and more than 300 REO homes.

"This deal and others we've closed during the third quarter support our view
that plentiful opportunities continue to be available in the marketplace that
meet our strict underwriting criteria for portfolio composition and pricing,"
Gary Beasley, co-chief executive officer of Starwood Waypoint Residential Trust,
said in the release.

Eureka council authorizes liens for delinquent garbage accounts

BYLINE: Allison Edrington/The Times-Standard

SECTION: NEWS; Local

LENGTH: 443 words


The Eureka City Council approved moving forward with property liens on Tuesday
to collect on delinquent garbage and recycling bills within the city.

Garbage and recycling collection has been mandatory in Eureka since 2009 in an
effort to increase the city's diversion rates, said City Project Manager Miles
Slattery. According to a city staff report, more than 420 accounts received
notices that they were past due, with unpaid amounts ranging from under $4 to
more than $900. The council passed a resolution that will allow city staff to
collect the fees through the special assessment liens, which will be collected
along with property taxes after they are filed with Humboldt County.

Slattery told the council that about 70 of the accounts listed have resolved
their unpaid balances as of Monday, and notices sent to property owners that
came back undelivered would be taken off the list until the owners could be
contacted. Property owners would be given time to pay their dues or set up
payment plans before the liens are filed, Slattery said.

Councilman Lance Madsen said he would like to revisit how the delinquent
accounts are handled at a future meeting to consider adding fees for accounts
that require a lien to cover staff time.

The council also unanimously adopted amendments to the medical marijuana
ordinance with no additional discussion and a seemingly collective sigh of
relief. The land use-based ordinance was discussed at length at prior meetings
this year.

Some of the amendments include limiting the size of exterior signs to 6 square
feet, allowing only one dispensary per cultivation and processing facility,
clarifying that the council does not have to invite applicants to meet the
maximum limit of facilities, prohibiting the display of live or pictured
cannabis plants on signs, including monitoring and inspection language for the
conditional use permit renewal and linking what a cultivation site produces
exclusively to the dispensary it runs.

In other matters, the council appointed Madsen to be the city's representative
to the Humboldt Bay Municipal Water District's Water Task Force, and
Councilwoman Marian Brady was appointed as an alternate.

Councilman Mike Newman also asked the council to draft a letter to send to the
Citizens Redistricting Commission to request the North Coast be included in the
first round of hearings on the redistricting process. The council unanimously
approved sending the letter. Mayor Frank Jager said they should include that
this is the "real Northern California," not San Francisco and other "central
California" regions.

Delinquent tax properties sold by county

BYLINE: Gary Nelson, Crossville Chronicle, Tenn.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 363 words


Sept. 26--CROSSVILLE -- The Cumberland County Commission approved the sale of
several delinquent tax properties owned by the county during its September
monthly meeting.

Resolution 09-2012-3 was approved, accepting an offer of $1,750 for 35 parcels
of property located in Lake Tansi.

The Cumberland County Delinquent Tax Committee approved and recommended the sale
during its meeting prior to the Cumberland County Commission meeting.

The sale was approved by the county commission in a 15-2 vote after a motion was
made by Charles Seiber, 4th District. Seiber's motion was supported by Nancy
Hyder, 2nd District commissioner.

The property was sold to US Assets, Inc.

Commissioners Larry Allen and Terry Carter, 6th District, voted no.

Resolution 09-2012-4 was approved, accepting an offer of $1,000 for the sale of
five parcels of property. One parcel is located on Tuner Greenhouse Rd., the
remaining parcels are located in Lake Tansi.

The sale was approved after a motion was made by Roy Turner, 7th District
commissioner. Turner's motion was supported by Hyder and approved in a 15-2
vote. Commissioners Allen and Carter voted against the sale.

The parcels were sold to Robert and Gloria Lockhart.

In other areas, the county commission approved the name change of a road.

Resolution 09-2012-5 was unanimously approved. The resolution changes the name
of a road back from Calusa Circle to Warpath Circle. According to the
resolution, the name was changed, for an unknown reason in 2008, without
planning commission or county commission's approval. There is only one family
who lives on the road, and they have requested changing the name back to Warpath
Circle.

The change was also approved by the 911 Committee, and Cumberland County Road
Superintendent Scott Blaylock has no objections, and the name change was also
approved by the planning commission and environmental committee.

The resolution was approved after a motion was made by Allen. Allen's motion was
supported by Joe Koester, 5th District commissioner.

Consumers Pay Credit Cards Ahead Of Mortgages: Report

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 4 Vol. 15 No. 2

LENGTH: 446  words


Consumers are continuing to place a higher priority on making their credit card
payments than their mortgage payments, affirming a trend that began with the
recession, according to a new data TransUnion released early last month.

TransUnion's research suggests that as real estate values have fallen,
especially among consumers with lower average credit scores, keeping up with
credit card payments has become more important to their daily financial
survival.

The trend emerged during the first quarter of 2008, when an earlier TransUnion
study found that the percentage of consumers current on credit cards and
delinquent on mortgages had for the first time surpassed the percentage of those
current on mortgages and delinquent on credit cards.

TransUnion's latest research, drawing on data gathered from 2007 through the
third quarter of last year, involved consumers who had at least one credit card
and a mortgage and were at least 30 days late on a payment. It found that credit
card payments continue to be higher in consumers' payment hierarchies than are
mortgage payments. TranUnion gathered its data from its proprietary historical
database of 27 million anonymous consumer records randomly sampled every quarter
from its national consumer credit database.

The percentage of consumers current on their credit cards and delinquent on
their mortgages rose to 6.6% during the quarter ended Sept. 30, up from 4.3%
during the quarter ended March 31, 2008. Conversely, the percentage of consumers
current on their mortgages and delinquent on their credit cards during the same
time period decreased to 3.6% from 4.1%.

The payment-hierarchy shifts were more pronounced in states hardest hit by the
real estate downturn, TransUnion says. In Florida, where housing values plunged,
the percentage of consumers current on their credit cards but delinquent on
their mortgages increased to 12.4% during the third quarter of 2009 from 5.1%
during the same period two years earlier, and in California the same variable
rose to 10.2% from 3.5%.

"The implosion of the mortgage industry over the last 24 months, the resetting
of adjustable-rate mortgages and the weak job market have all come to together
to redefine how consumers are managing their finances and meeting (or not
meeting) their credit obligations," Ezra Becker, director of consulting and
strategy in TransUnion's financial services business unit, said in a statement.
"The financial-services industry must recognize and adjust to the
payment-hierarchy shift with judicious modifications to business models, new
assessments of specific areas of risk, and by strategic revisions to acquisition
and account management strategies."

Consumers Continue To Put Credit Card Payments Before Mortgages

Consumers are continuing to place a higher priority on making their credit card

Erie may get $1.8M boost

BYLINE: Kara Rhodes, Erie Times-News, Pa.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 454 words


Mar. 16--City Finance Director Ron Komorek on Wednesday presented to Erie City
Council a plan that could add an unexpected $1.8 million to the city's coffers
for 2006.

The plan, outlined at council's finance meeting, calls for the city to sell its
liens on delinquent real estate taxes for at least 90 cents on the dollar. That
will net the city about $1.8 million in unbudgeted money in 2006, Komorek said.

"That's money we could see relatively quickly," he said.

That's good news for city officials, who have been grappling with a way to cope
with a $2.3 million deficit just three months into the year.

"I think we should go for it," said City Council President Rubye
Jenkins-Husband. "It's revenue. We need it. Let's go for it."

If City Council signs a multiyear deal with the company, it will likely net
between $1.4 and $1.8 million each year afterward, Komorek said.

The plan was proposed to the city by Municipal Revenue Service, an Erie-based
company that has done similar deals with 13 other cities and school districts in
the state, including the city of Harrisburg and the Scranton School District.

MRS, in turn, makes money on the deal if more than 90 percent of the delinquent
real estate taxes are collected.

The Erie County Tax Claim Bureau collects, on average, about 93 percent of
delinquent city real estate taxes, though sometimes it takes years to see the
money.

"Basically, we're accelerating our cash flow," Komorek told City Council. "I
don't see a downside to this. We're not taking a risk."

MRS officials could not be reached for comment Wednesday. They did not attend
Wednesday's meeting.

Komorek said the Tax Claim Bureau would continue to operate just as it does now
and delinquent taxpayers would not be affected by the deal. Timetables for
collection would stay the same.

City Council Finance Committee Chairwoman Jessica Horan-Kunco said the idea
appears strong on the face of it.

But she and other council members agreed it is important to send the proposal
out for bid instead of accepting Municipal Revenue Service's offer immediately.

But when -- and if -- the money materializes, another argument could erupt.

City Councilman Jim Thompson said he would like the money to be set aside in a
reserve fund.

But Jon Whaley, Mayor Joe Sinnott's top aide, said he doesn't believe the city
will have that luxury.

"We really need that money this year," he said.

MGIC Business Up 4th Consecutive Month

BYLINE: Mortgage Daily

SECTION: BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS

LENGTH: 249 words


July 11--In addition to reducing its delinquent inventory each month for nearly
three years, MGIC Guaranty Insurance Corp. has managed to increase new business
for four consecutive months.

In a monthly operational report, the mortgage insurance company said that it
wrote $3.2 billion in primary new insurance during June.

Activity was bolstered from the previous month, when business came in at $2.8
billion. It was additionally better than the same month last year, when policies
written also came in at $2.8 billion.

In fact, primary new insurance written has moved higher every month since
February of this year.

During the entire first half of 2014, the Milwaukee-based company wrote $13.5
billion in new insurance.

MGIC reported that its primary delinquent inventory finished last month at
85,416 loans, diminishing from 86,415 at the end of May.

The delinquent inventory was 117,105 as of June 30, 2013.

The mortgage insurer has reduced its delinquent inventory each month since July
2011, when it was at 185,093.

In addition, the delinquent inventory has not been this low at any point since
2009 -- the oldest available performance data.

Using an estimate of 938,605 policies in force as of June 30, 2014, the
estimated delinquency rate was 9.10 percent, improving from an estimated 9.17
percent the prior month.

MGIC previously reported its June 2013 delinquency rate at 12.00 percent.

LAND RICH, CASH POOR

BYLINE: CHUIN-WEI YAP, Times Staff Writer

SECTION: PASCO TIMES; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 705 words



HIGHLIGHT: Unpaid property taxes put the squeeze on a reputable builder.


Smith Family Homes, a 10-year-old builder with projects in eight Tampa Bay area
communities, owes the tax collectors of Pasco and Hillsborough counties more
than $1.2-million in delinquent property taxes.

Those in the building community say Smith is a reputable builder caught in tough
times. The company owes at least $856,995 to Pasco and $421,590 to Hillsborough,
according to a review of tax records.

In Pasco, Smith is delinquent on 352 properties from the 2007 tax roll, which
means Smith didn't pay taxes on them by April 1, said Tax Collector Mike Olson.
He also counted 185 Smith properties that have been delinquent since 2006.

The lots are usually less than an acre. The delinquencies are spread across
Pasco, in prestigious developments like Connerton and Wilderness Lake Preserve
in Land O'Lakes, Seven Oaks in Wesley Chapel, Greyhawk at Lake Polo in Odessa,
Suncoast Lakes in Shady Hills and the Greens at Hidden Creek in Zephyrhills.

Founded by Ronald Smith in 1998 as Premier Homes of Southwest Florida, the
company changed its name to Smith Family Homes in 2004. Smith, the firm's
president, didn't reply to a call for comment from the Pasco Times.

Delinquent taxes don't always signal a company is about to go under, but Olson
pointed to signs that suggest Smith Family Homes is facing cash flow problems.

When a taxpayer doesn't pay taxes by April, the tax collector sells the
property's tax certificate by June. The tax certificate is a loan in exchange
for a lien on the property. The certificate buyer pays the outstanding tax, but
earns interest when the "loan" is repaid. The certificate is cancelled if the
taxes are paid.

But if the taxpayer is unable to pay the taxes two years after the property goes
delinquent, the tax certificate holder can apply for the deed. The property is
then auctioned to the highest bidder.

Here's the problem for Smith: 12 tax deed applications have been filed this year
against their 2005 property tax delinquencies, which indicates Smith was unable
to save those properties, Olson said.

"Some people don't pay taxes because you could get a better interest rate from a
tax certificate buyer than from a bank," Olson said. "They know how the market
works and they run the risk. But the only thing (troubling for Smith) is the
fact that there are these parcels that people have filed tax deed applications
on recently."

Unless the market recovers quickly enough for the company to regain its cash
flow, Smith could lose hundreds of properties in the years ahead.

The Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation does not list any
complaints against the firm. Unlike other builders like Levitt & Sons and Tousa,
Smith hasn't filed for bankruptcy, according to court records. But there are
dozens of liens in the last year against Smith for unpaid services, including
the installation of insulation and other materials.

Still, some of Smith's lien holders said they've enjoyed good relations with the
builder, and that its financial troubles are a result of the market downturn.

"They've got inventory, obviously, and there are a lot of slow payers out
there," said Jerome Harrell of Harrells Drywall of Tampa, who has a $8,500 lien
against Smith. "It's been okay dealing with them. There are quite a few people
that have some difficulties right now. Hopefully, they'll be out of this."

Smith doesn't have an extensive presence in Florida, but over the years, it has
won local accolades, including merit awards for its single-family homes from the
Tampa Bay Builders Association last year. Smith has involved itself in community
life as well, sending a team of volunteers in January this year to help
residents of Connerton build a playground out of donated materials.

"They build a good product," said Dale "Chip" Jones, president of the Pasco
Building Association and a top executive at Connerton. "By all indications they
have a good reputation. We were aware of liens against their houses, (but) they,
like many other regional builders, are feeling the pressures of a really
difficult housing market. I have known them to be nothing but above board."

Mower treasurer finds himself in 'taxing' situation

BYLINE: Christina Killion Valdez, Post-Bulletin, Rochester, Minn.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 400 words


Mar. 20--Increasing property taxes combined with a decreasing economy seems to
equal more delinquencies in Mower County.

Mower County reported $305,460.89 in delinquent property taxes to Mower District
Court last month, which follows a growing trend seen since at least 2006. This
year, however, the county took a stand.

"We've been more aggressive in our collection attempts because of higher tax and
numbers," said Doug Groh, Mower County auditor-treasurer.

Traditionally his office sends out a late notice in December warning property
owners that their taxes will be considered delinquent in the new year, followed
by a notice once the property is considered delinquent. This year, after
noticing a high number of delinquencies, his office sent out delinquent letters
twice rather than once, as has been done in previous years, he said.

The additional notice helped bring in $436,522 worth of property taxes in less
than two months, Groh said.

Leading to the increased delinquencies, Groh said, is higher taxes coming during
tough economic times.

In cases of commercial property, developers have not paid their taxes because of
the economy, Groh said. There are also people who have fallen on hard times
because the economy is bad, they are out of work or on disability or are elderly
and on a fixed income, he said.

"There's a lot of frustration with a number of people I see here," he said.
"They come in claiming that their taxes are too high or higher than past years
and their inability to pay."

Not paying, however, can put a property owner in jeopardy of forfeiture.

"We try to make them aware of the fact that their property is subject to
forfeiture," he said. "They can make a confession of judgment, saying that they
acknowledge the tax penalty and county cost and they agree to pay those
delinquent taxes with interest and costs on a payment plan."

If people don't make the payment or maintain their current year tax payment, he
said, forfeiture proceedings start to take place.

Poster parents: On the lam;
23 sought for support payments

Gregory Lewis Morey is about to become a legend among delinquent fathers.

Already he's legendary among Arizona authorities. During a decade on the run,
they say, Morey hopped among six Western states, changing his Social Security
number four times, to get out of paying $ 600 a month in child support.

But starting today his hard-sought anonymity could be harder to come by. Morey's
face and name, and those of 22 other child-support evaders, will be appearing on
''wanted'' posters nationwide.

Employing a tough and controversial tactic now used in several states, the
National Council of State Child Support Enforcement Administrators is issuing
the national list of fugitive delinquent parents who owe a total of more than $
650,000 in back child support.

Morey's distinction: He tops the list, with a debt of $ 74,100 to his ex- wife
and children.

''We are scraping by, like we have been for years,'' says Morey's ex-wife, Susan
Aldrich of Phoenix, who with her three children has been on and off welfare
since her 1981 divorce.

Although she's remarried - and her new husband supports the family on $ 25,000 a
year - she hopes Morey will be found.

''These kids still know what it's like to go without a meal,'' she says.

Harry Wiggins, president of the child support group, says the list is designed
specifically to help authorities track down missing evaders. Experts estimate
40% of people who don't pay child support dodge state officials by moving
around.

What happened to Susan Aldrich and her family is typical: Government statistics
show that nearly two-thirds of women on welfare for the first time are divorced
or separated.

Despite the recent passage of federal laws that allow seizure of wages and tax
refunds, Wiggins says, some delinquents ''are so far underground, we don't have
a clue.''

Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., sponsored a bill now in Congress that would make it a
federal crime for parents owing child support to move out of state to avoid
payment.

Wiggins says the problem will be harder to solve.

In addition to moving around, he says, evaders change their names, Social
Security numbers and birth dates to get around national computer-database
searches.

But for all the high-tech tracking equipment, Wiggins is banking on the success
of old-fashioned wanted posters. The posters, which will be displayed in state
offices and public buildings, will include a phone number for people to call in
tips.

Wiggins expects some delinquent parents, fearing their names and faces will show
up next, will turn themselves in.

''We'll get these guys,'' he says. ''It's going to take time.''

While the posters may be successful - authorities in Virginia have found 23 of
27 parents in a similar campaign - some say they violate parents' privacy rights
and wreak emotional havoc on the children.

Parents who don't pay should not be held up to ''national ridicule,'' says David
L. Levy, president of the National Council for Children's Rights.

''It's traumatic for a child to see a parent in handcuffs or ridiculed,'' he
says. ''There have got to be better ways.''

But supporters say delinquent parents lose their rights when they stop paying.

''When you commit a crime I think you lose your right to privacy,'' says Horace
Satcher of Alabama's Child Support Enforcement Division. ''They are guilty of
criminal conduct.''

Letters: Good move for Philly to crack down on tax delinquents

SECTION: EDITORIAL; P-com Opinion; Pg. A19

ISSUE | PHILA. TAXES

Good to crack down on delinquents

The Greater Philadelphia Association of Realtors applauds the efforts of Mayor
Kenney and City Councilman Allan Domb to reinvigorate the collection process for
delinquent property taxes ("Phila. may expand tax-liens program," July 8).

Last year, the city collected more than $17 million after conducting two
successful sales of property-tax liens. This illustrates that owed revenues can
be collected when there is government will.

Most private property owners do the responsible thing: They pay their taxes on
time or ask for assistance when they have difficulty paying their bills. But
there are thousands of people who choose not to pay because they know they can
get away with it, and that is not fair.

An increase of the city's

92 percent tax-collection rate will positively impact the School District, the
city's financial health, and the public's trust in the system.

We encourage the city to continue using creative, proven, and effective tools to
recover delinquent taxes. This is a better strategy for Philadelphia's fiscal
well-being than creating or increasing taxes.

|Paul Garvey, president, Greater Philadelphia Association of Realtors,
Philadelphia

BRIEF: Erie School Board approves Modern Tool tax plan

BYLINE: Erica Erwin, Erie Times-News, Pa.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 181 words


Oct. 24--The owner of Modern Tool wants to reach an agreement on delinquent
taxes owed on the buildings to stave off a judicial sale.

The Erie School Board is prepared to accept his proposal.

The board tonight approved a compromise settlement, proposed by Erie County,
that would require owner Kirk Steehler to pay $630,000 toward $659,955 in
current and delinquent taxes and some penalties and interest on two properties,
10 E. Fourth St. and a French Street parking lot.

The delinquent taxes date back to 2009.

Under the agreement, the county, school district and city would forgive the
remaining nearly $30,000 in penalties and interest.

Steehler would pay $500,000 by Dec. 13 and $130,000 in installments over three
years starting in March.

Erie City Council approved the county's request on Oct. 16; Erie County Court
must still approve the agreement.

The properties were to be included in a Dec. 13 judicial sale if the delinquent
taxes were not paid.

Driven to yank tax scofflaws' licenses [Exclusive]

BYLINE: Carl Campanile

SECTION: All Editions; Pg. 2

LENGTH: 563 words


Gov. Cuomo is taking the car keys away from tax deadbeats.

The Department of Motor of Motor Vehicles has suspended the driver's licenses of
7,850 motorists who owe the state more than $10,000 in back taxes, The Post has
learned.

The effort is part of a state tax-enforcement program, launched last year, to
prod delinquents into ponying up.

The state has already collected $48 million from thousands of other tax
delinquents who value their driving privileges.

"Scofflaws who are ducking their tax bills should be on notice that the state
will use any and all tools at [its] disposal to get them to pay what they owe,"
Cuomo said. "Judging by the success of this initiative, that message has been
heard loud and clear."

Since last summer, the state Tax Department has warned more than 17,000 tax
delinquents of the consequences of failing to settle their debts. Authorities
told the deadbeats that their names would be forwarded to the DMV for action if
they failed to respond within 60 days.

It was no idle threat. Thus far, 7,850 scofflaws' licenses have been suspended
for six months, said a Tax Department spokesman, Geoffrey Gloak.

Most of those suspended are in the New York City area: 1,104 from Manhattan;
1,071 from Queens; 1,019 from Brooklyn; 797 from Suffolk; 725 from Nassau; 469
from The Bronx; 461 from Westchester; 300 from Staten Island; 133 from Rockland;
and 36 from Putnam.

Another 5,700 tardy taxpayers have seen the light and either have paid up in
full or entered into a payment agreement.

Still, 3,500 other delinquents are in jeopardy of losing their licenses if they
don't pay up soon, officials said.

The tough-love program has been a success, said Tax Commissioner Tom Mattox.

"Collection of past-due liabilities has totaled nearly $48 million," Mattox
said.

That's substantially more than the $26 million tax watchdogs initially expected
to collect from the crackdown, he noted.

Gloak said, "This is an example of an enforcement program that also serves as a
deterrent. This program has definitely had an impact."

The program has broad bipartisan support in the state Legislature.

"Any enforcement program that collects $48 million is a program that's working,"
said Brooklyn Republican state Sen. Martin Golden.

"Driving is a privilege in New York. And if you don't pay your taxes, we take
your privilege away. This will force people to make paying taxes a priority."

The state may have a difficult time collecting from some of its biggest tax
scofflaws - who are already either grounded or dead, according to a review of
its tax warrants.

The estate of Frank A. Marchello, an Albany strip- club owner who died in 2002,
has the biggest outstanding state tax warrant - $24.5 million.

Then comes a man very much alive, opera philanthropist Alberto Vilar, who spent
time in the slammer for securities fraud and money laundering. He owes $17.9
million, according to the Tax Department.

And there's a tax warrant for Abraham Hirschfeld for $13.1 million. The
real-estate developer died in 2005.

Charlotte-area foreclosure rate at 0.8%

BYLINE: Roberta Fuchs

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 472  words


The share of Charlotte-area homes with a mortgage that were facing foreclosure
in May remained at 0.8 percent of all homes, the same as in April but down 0.3
percentage points from May 2014, according to real estate data firm CoreLogic.

Statewide, 0.7 percent of homes with a mortgage were in the foreclosure process
in May, the same as in April but 0.2 percentage points lower than a year ago.

North Carolina's foreclosure rate was less than the nation's 1.3 percent rate in
May. According to CoreLogic, the nation hasn't seen a rate this low since
December 2007. Across the United States, only Massachusetts, Wyoming and
Washington, D.C., saw rises in their foreclosure inventory.

"With three million jobs created during the past year, the improving labor
market has helped more borrowers stay current on their mortgage loan," said
Frank Nothaft, chief economist at CoreLogic.

CoreLogic considers only mortgaged homes with first liens in determining its
foreclosure inventory data, which covers the number of homes placed in the
foreclosure process by the mortgage servicer.

Locally, the rate of Charlotte-Concord-Gastonia area mortgages that were 90 days
or more past due, or seriously delinquent, in May was 2.9 percent, down from 3.1
percent in April. The region had a 3.9 percent seriously delinquent rate in May
2014.

Nationally, 3.5 percent of homes were seriously delinquent in May, down from 4.4
percent a year ago. The greater New York City area and central Florida had some
of the highest delinquency rates, almost double the national average. Default
rates also remain high in Chicago and Baltimore.   In North Carolina, the
serious-delinquency rate dropped to 3 percent in May from 3.7 percent a year
ago.

There were 4,551 completed foreclosures in the Charlotte metro area for the year
ending in May, down 39 percent from 7,432 during the previous 12 months.

Nationally, completed foreclosures for the year ending in May fell to 528,382
from 644,581 the previous year. In North Carolina, that figure fell 29 percent
to 18,269 from 25,865.

Since the financial crisis peaked in September 2008, according to CoreLogic,
about 5.7 million homes nationwide have been lost to foreclosure.

The five states with the highest number of completed foreclosures for the 12
months ending in May were Florida with 104,000, Michigan with 46,000, Texas with
33,000, California with 28,000, and Ohio with 27,000. These states accounted for
nearly half of all completed foreclosures nationally.

Four states and Washington, D.C., had the lowest number of completed
foreclosures in the same period. They were South Dakota at 19; Washington, D.C.,
at 105; North Dakota at 326; Wyoming at 498; and West Virginia at 500.

City fire department struggles to collect fees for ambulance service

BYLINE: Kandra Wells, McAlester News-Capital, Okla.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 535 words


Aug. 5--McAlester's city council last week tabled two fire department purchases,
including a plan to contract out billing and collections for ambulance services.

Over the past four years, municipal ambulance runs have increased an estimated
80 percent, from about 100 each month in 2006 to 180 this year. But the city
billed more than $500,000 in ambulance services last year, down about 15 percent
from the previous year and expected to fall again this year. Fire officials say
that's because billing for those ambulance runs is so far behind, even with
part-time and temporary help hired for the task.

"It is just overwhelming," Fire Chief Harold Stewart told the council at its
July 28 meeting.

The agency hopes to hire Intermedix of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., to automate
billing each time a city ambulance is used.

The council deferred review of the 61-page proposal to its Audit and Finance
Committee, tabling a decision until the Aug. 25 council session.

The Intermedix cost would be 10 percent of the fees it collects, and 20 percent
for those delinquent fees sent to collections.

Presently the city pays a 30 percent capture fee for delinquent collections.

Another bidder for the job was RAM Software Systems of Slippery Rock, Pa., at a
cost of $11,882 for the first year, plus 7 percent of all collections, plus 30
percent for delinquent collections. After the first year, RAM's annual cost
declines to $3,600 , in addition to the 7 percent fee, and 30 percent for
delinquent collections.

According to Stewart, another option would be hiring a part-time employee and
buying new software at a cost of $63,683 for the first year. After that the cost
would be an estimated $28,642 per year, plus the 30 percent now paid for any
delinquent collections.

In other Fire Department action July 28, the council tabled the purchase of a
$22,944 truck from an Oklahoma City auto dealer so that local bids could be
sought. The money comes from a 2008 state grant for a truck outfitted especially
for fighting grass and brush fires. According to Stewart, recent ice storms have
left "a heavy fire load in much of the underbrush" in and around the city.

Stewart explained that the Oklahoma City auto dealer, Bob Hurley, was bidding a
reduced cost as a state contractor. He told councilors one local dealer, Nix
Ford, had bid $810 more than Hurley's state contract cost.

Also pulled from the council agenda at the July 28 meeting was the purchase of
another city truck for the Parks Department, also to solicit local bids.

In other Fire Department action at the meeting, the council approved spending
$52,447 in equipment to outfit the new fire truck, once it is purchased.

In a capital project request submitted in March for this year's budget, Stewart
had estimated the equipment would cost $30,000.

Fla., N.Y., N.J. Hold Outsized Share of Delinquent Loans: Black Knight

BYLINE: Andy Peters

SECTION: DISTRESSED Vol. 1 No. 1

LENGTH: 163  words


Three states - Florida, New York and New Jersey - held almost 30% of all
seriously delinquent and active foreclosure homes nationwide in April, according
to Black Knight Financial Services.

Although bothseriously delinquent and active foreclosure inventories have
improved over recent months, both categories still remain between two and three
times pre-financial-crisis levels, Black Knight said in its monthly Mortgage
Monitor Report for April.

The total U.S. loan delinquency rate for April was 4.77%, an increase of 1.46%
from the previous month. The total foreclosure presale inventory rate was 1.51%,
a decline of 2.43%.

Black Knight also reported that about 62% of all borrowers classified as at
least 90 days past due have been enrolled in a type of home-retention program.
Overall retention actions have declined over the past two years, but now make up

Wilson County delinquent tax sale set for next week

BYLINE: The Lebanon Democrat, Tenn.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 226 words


July 05--Wilson County will hold a delinquent tax sale July 12 at 10 a.m. in the
chancery courtroom at the Wilson County Judicial Center at 134 S. College St. in
Lebanon.

Potential buyers are encouraged to arrive on time to hear about the terms of the
tax sale.  Back Tax Attorney Bob Rochelle will warn it is a "buyer beware" sale,
where the buyer takes more risk than if buying from an individual or through a
realtor.

Potential purchasers are encouraged to thoroughly investigate the parcels before
the sale, Rochelle said.

The county will sell 40 parcels. A list of the parcels slated for sale may be
picked up from the office of the clerk and master.

"There may be parcels paid before the sale date. Of course, they will be dropped
from the sale," said Rochelle. "Prospective purchasers should make their own
inquiry into the state of the title and condition of each parcel."

The sale is part of a continuing effort by Wilson County and the cities of
Lebanon, Mt. Juliet and Watertown to reduce the amount of delinquent taxes owed.

"Doing a good job collecting delinquent taxes also improves current tax
collections," Rochelle said. "For instance, the county turned over about
$350,000 less in delinquent taxes this year."

CSA clarifies process of placing juvenile delinquents in detention centers

BYLINE: Lauren Kirkwood

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 814  words


While juvenile courts have the right to specify the type of facility in which a
juvenile delinquent is placed, they lack the authority to require a child be
committed to a particular facility -- or to exclude a child from a particular
facility, the Court of Special Appeals has ruled.

In clarifying Section 5-607 of the Family Law Article of the Maryland Code, the
court further found it is a violation of due-process rights for a court to
commit a child to an out-of-state facility without granting him a hearing in
which he and his parents may argue whether the placement is in his best interest
and whether it would pose an undue hardship on his family.

"It affirms that before a juvenile can be sent to an out-of-state facility, that
they need to have a meaningful opportunity to challenge that decision, to argue
that that is not appropriate for the case," said Brian Saccenti, who leads the
appellate division of the public defender's office.

In its decision to take up the case of a juvenile delinquent identified as W.Y.
-- who was released from detention last year and is now an adult -- the
intermediate appellate court noted that while the appeal is moot, the case
raised matters of "great public importance. " The court also noted that the
issue is likely to recur and to escape appellate review because the appellate
process often lasts longer than juvenile commitments, as it did in W.Y. 's case.

However, Odeana Neal, a University of Baltimore School of Law professor who
teaches a course on juvenile justice, said she would not call the decision
groundbreaking.

"It's saying, when the statute says you're supposed to do something, do what the
statute says," said Neal, who was not involved in the W.Y. case. "Unfortunately,
I do think that sometimes, particularly in juvenile court, judges seem to
believe so long as they're acting with what they think is in the best interest
of the child, they aren't as attentive to the statutes as they perhaps should
be. " 'Insufficiently rehabilitated' After W.Y. pleaded involved to a robbery
count in Prince George's County Circuit Court in 2012, the court recommended
that he be assigned a "level B" placement at a staff-secured, non-community
residential facility, according to the opinion. W.Y. was placed at the Victor
Cullen Center in Frederick County, which at the time offered only level B
services. He remained there from May 2, 2012 until Oct. 17, 2012, when he was
released and placed on probation.

W.Y. was arrested again on May 26, 2014, in connection with a robbery. He pled
involved to a count of possession of a regulated firearm by a person under age
21, the reported opinion states.

The court concluded that W had been "insufficiently rehabilitated" at a level B
facility and ordered that he be placed in a "level A," or hardware-secure,
rather than staff-secure, facility instead. The court also ordered that W not be
returned to the Victor Cullen Center, which by that point had begun offering
both level B and level A services -- and the only facility in Maryland offering
level A services, according to the reported opinion, which was released in July.

On Jan. 28, 2015, W.Y. was placed at a level A facility in Pennsylvania. He was
released and placed on probation in October.

The Court of Special Appeals agreed with W.Y. that the juvenile court had abused
its discretion by limiting his placement beyond the type of facility.

"The court was well within its authority to commit W.Y. to a level A, or
hardware-secure, placement, but exceeded its statutory authority in excluding
him from the Victor Cullen Center," Judge Douglas R.M. Nazarian wrote. "The
court is, of course, free to offer recommendations, and the suggestion that W
would be better off not returning to the site of his last placement could be a
sensible one. But the statute gives (the Department of Juvenile Services], not
the court, the ultimate authority to place the child so long as the facility was
of the same (or more restrictive) type of placement as the judge ordered. "

While he did not challenge the level A placement itself, W.Y. said the court
ignored the law when it did not hear evidence before concluding that an
out-of-state placement was in his best interest and would not amount to undue
hardship for his family.

The state argued that no one had opposed W.Y. 's out-of-state placement. But the
appellate court ruled that there was no evidence W.Y. or his family were told of
the possibility before his hearing.

Although a judge had stated W.Y. would be committed to a level A placement other
than the Victor Cullen Center, his family could not reasonably be expected to
know the center was the only in-state level A facility, the court found.

The case is In Re: W.Y., No. 2726, September Term 2014.

Washington: HON. JOHN CONYERS, JR. OF MICHIGAN IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Tuesday, July 22, 2014

LENGTH: 665  words

DATELINE: Washington


The Library of Congress, The Government of USA has issued the following Speech:

Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, water is a human right. I applaud the recent decision
to suspend Detroit's water shutoffs for 15 days to enable residents to
demonstrate financial hardship. This is a first step in preventing a regional
public health crisis and protecting the basic rights of Detroit residents.

I submit the following editorial from the Detroit Free Press, which makes the
case that recent water-shutoffs, which have been implemented with little or no
warning to households, are wrong-headed and shortsighted.
 [From the Detroit Free Press, July 21, 2014]
 ENDING DETROIT'S WATER SHUT OFFS A GOOD START

On Monday morning, the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department announced that it's
calling a 15-day halt to an aggressive shutoff campaign that has left an unknown
number of Detroiters without water.

It's a start.

The department has about 137,000 delinquent residential accounts totaling about
$75 million, and about 10,000 delinquent commercial accounts worth about $23
million.

Folks who can pay should pay what they owe. But department officials have to
accept that some Detroiters just can't pay--and further, that the department
itself has created an expectation in customers juggling bills that it's OK to
prioritize other debts. If the water department's goal is to get, and keep,
delinquent customers current on bills, ramping up shutoffs with no warning to
ratepayers was a wrong-headed, shortsighted way to proceed.

After weeks of public protest, harsh words from the United Nations, the federal
judge overseeing Detroit's bankruptcy and this newspaper's Editorial Board, the
department seems to get it.

Department officials say they plan a citywide advertising blitz, complete with
outreach to community groups and churches. That's excellent news, but outreach
must be paired with concerted efforts to match impoverished residents with
financial assistance to pay up and stay current.

The department should also consider income-based partial amnesty for ratepayers
who are truly unable to catch up, or comparing data with social service agencies
to identify customers who are in need of assistance.

The department must also identify vacant, abandoned homes and target those
first. There's little excuse for cutting off water to families as a cost-saving
tactic when empty buildings are flooding.

We've been told, confidently, by the folks in charge that no one who honestly
cannot afford to pay is being deprived of service; that's overconfidence at
best, and outright dishonesty at worst, as documented in Free Press reporter
Patricia Montemurri's story about conditions in the city this weekend.

Some adherents of the department's shutoff campaign have dismissed fears that
disconnection from clean water and modern sanitation could lead to a public
health crisis, noting that the vast majority of delinquent account holders pay
up promptly and have water restored. But let's consider the reality of this
situation: If just 10% of the ratepayers currently delinquent are unable to pay
to have service restored, we're talking about more than 10,000 residents. It's
terrible public policy.

All of this against the backdrop of the city's bankruptcy, and the department's
efforts to clean up bad debt in an attempt to make a regional water authority
more attractive to suburban county executives. (Though let's also keep in mind
that aides to Oakland County Executive L. Brooks Patterson wrote in a February
report to the Oakland County Commission that ``stoppage of water and sewer
service for tens of thousands of fiscally distressed members of the system is
unacceptable policy and one the Oakland County executive will never support.'')

Detroit is a poor city. About 38% of residents live in poverty. Our unemployment
rate is twice the national average. It's time to talk about what our goals are,
and rethink how we deliver water.

Lawton, tax collector discuss revenue discrepancy

BYLINE: Michael P. Buffer, The Citizens' Voice, Wilkes-Barre, Pa.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 465 words


Nov. 01--Luzerne County Manager Robert Lawton and John Rodgers, president of the
company that collects delinquent county taxes, met Wednesday to discuss a
revenue discrepancy that could result in a $3 million hole in next year's
budget.

A budget gap could force more spending cuts to avoid a tax hike next year or an
unbalanced budget. Lawton on Oct. 20 proposed a general-fund budget to spend
$122.2 million next year.

Rodgers, president of Northeast Revenue Service LLC, has said Lawton
overestimated revenue from selling overdue tax liens. According to the 2013
budget Lawton submitted to county council, selling delinquent 2011 tax liens
this year would generate $5.5 million, and that will help create $4.35 million
in year-end surplus funds to carry over as revenue in 2013.

The county can get $3.5 million selling delinquent 2011 tax liens, and Lawton's
2013 budget overestimates revenue from delinquent 2012 taxes by $1.5 million,
Rodgers said. Lawton's budget estimates $6 million in revenue from delinquent
2012 taxes; Rodgers estimated it would be $4.5 million.

If the county does not sell delinquent 2011 taxes, Rodgers said Northeast
Revenue would collect $8 million in overdue property taxes next year -- $3.5
million in late 2011 taxes and $4.5 million in late 2012 taxes.

After Wednesday's meeting, Lawton said he didn't reach any conclusions and is
meeting with Rodgers again Friday.

Rodgers said he will provide Lawton with a report this week on delinquent tax
collection. Councilman Rick Morelli sent Lawton an email Tuesday asking him to
meet with Rodgers, explaining "it would be a shame if there are problems with
this budget" due to a "lack of communication."

Council plans to hold a public hearing Monday on the proposed budget and must
adopt a final budget by Dec. 15. After meeting with Rodgers last Friday, council
Chairman Tim McGinley suggested Lawton and Rodgers meet and review revenue
estimates from back tax collection.

Northeast Revenue has collected $3.7 million in delinquent 2011 taxes so far
this year and is on pace to collect $4.5 million in delinquent 2011 taxes this
year, Rodgers said.

In an Oct. 23 email to council members, Lawton said Northeast Revenue collected
$2.7 million in delinquent 2011 taxes as of Sept. 23. If the $2.7 million figure
is correct, the county can get more revenue from selling delinquent tax liens.

The process allows a third party to buy delinquent tax liens from the county for
about 90 to 95 percent of what is owed. The county would receive an up-front
influx of cash, instead of waiting for overdue tax payments from property
owners.

Trends in the Region: Florida Counties Use Web to Recover Delinquent Tax Revenue



                             July 8, 2004, Thursday

DATELINE: BRADENTON, Fla.



Four Florida tax collectors this year conducted the first Internet-based
auctions of delinquent property taxes, in the process collecting revenue that
supports local government budgets and also their respective general obligation
debt.

Using the Internet to auction off tax certificates to investors -- versus a live
auction that requires bidders to appear in person in each county -- was less
expensive for Miami-Dade, Okaloosa, Orange, and Volusia counties. It also opened
up the annual sale of tax certificates to more investors who ended up paying
nearly all the delinquent taxes owed to the counties. In return investors
receive a rate of interest on the delinquent taxes owed that is established
through the auction process.

In Miami-Dade, which handles the largest number of tax certificate sales in the
state each year, tax collector Ian Yorty used to reserve a room large enough to
hold a physical auction and hire professional auctioneers to call out delinquent
tax notices.

The costly process would take as long as a month.

"By doing it online, it took the process to less than three-and-a-half days,"
Yorty said. "We sold $110 million in delinquent taxes. Everything was purchased
and it was one of the most efficient things I've seen in a long time."

Miami-Dade's Internet auction attracted 279 bidders who purchased all 31,777 tax
certificates that were offered for sale.

Last year, Miami-Dade's live auction drew 134 bidders who paid $105.2 million in
delinquent taxes. That sale left 8,468 tax certificates unsold and the county
failed to collect $24.5 million in delinquent taxes.

Collectively this year, the four counties that used the Internet platform sold
all but 64 tax certificates out of more than 60,000 that were offered for sale
last month, according to results provided by Grant Street Group, which developed
the proprietary system used to conduct the auctions.

Those four counties received $157.2 million in delinquent taxes during this
year's sales, compared to $151.4 million in 2003 and $134.4 million in 2002.

The Internet auctions drew nearly 800 bidders who bought tax certificates for
the price of the taxes owed, plus an interest rate, and other fees. Bidders also
paid $10 for each tax certificate, which was paid to Grant Street.

Last year, 504 bidders bought tax certificates during traditional live auctions
held in the four counties. Of 81,000 tax certificates offered, more than 12,201
certificates were not sold, leaving $24.9 million in delinquent taxes unpaid and
unavailable to support local government budgets.

"Even I was amazed at how smoothly these four sales went off," said Myles
Harrington, president of Grant Street Group. "We've done a lot of product
launches since we started doing auctions in 1997 and this was the most
successful product launch."

Grant Street developed the Internet platform called LienAuction at a cost of
$1.5 million, said Harrington, whose firm operates the country's first Internet
site used to auction fixed-income instruments including bonds, notes, bills,
certificates of deposit, guaranteed investment contracts, tax certificates,
auction-rate certificates, and swaps.

Each year, Florida law requires tax collectors to sell tax certificates, also
known as tax liens, on land where the property taxes have not been paid. A
certificate is sold in the amount of the delinquent taxes due, plus interest and
related costs.

The auction starts at the state-mandated 18% interest rate and descends as
bidders compete for each tax certificate. The final interest rate represents the
rate of return the investor is willing to accept to pay the delinquent taxes.
The tax certificate does not entitle the winning bidder to the land.

The "reverse" auction in which bidders vie for the lowest interest rate is
designed to benefit the property owner who must pay the delinquent taxes and
interest established during the auction. If a tax certificate is not sold, the
interest rate is set at 18% and the tax certificate is held by the county.

Florida Tax Collectors Inc., a statewide organization, began working several
years ago on changes to state law to allow tax certificates to be sold
electronically in hopes of lowering the cost of holding auctions, providing
bidders with greater access, and streamlining tax office operations.

Organization president Chris Hughes, who is also the tax collector in Okaloosa
County, spearheaded the effort to use the latest technology and lower the costs
of the annual state mandated sales, he said.

State Rep. Juan Zapata of Miami sponsored legislation that passed last year
allowing electronic sales of tax certificates as well as through traditional
live auctions.

After the law passed, Harrington said he approached Hughes about developing an
Internet web site to auction certificates in 2004.

Florida is the only state that currently authorizes tax certificate sales over
the Internet and Grant Street Group is the only firm with the platform to
conduct the auctions, Harrington said.

"I foresee at least 20 Florida counties conducting an Internet auction next
year," Hughes predicted. "And I have already heard about government agencies in
other states wanting to develop similar products. We may have set the national
standard for delinquent tax collections."

Harrington expects other states to take notice of the increase in tax
collections as Florida's use of the platform becomes more widely known.

While some areas of the country have pooled tax liens or sold them in bulk to
securitize debt, Harrington said most have been unsuccessful because the tax
revenue stream is unreliable. The Internet auction platform would not lend
itself to securitizing tax liens particularly since they are sold on an
individual basis, he said.

Because of its potential to increase tax collections, the Internet platform
could benefit governments having difficulty making bond payments because of poor
property tax collections.

County to auction delinquent tax liens

BYLINE: By Rob Modic Staff Writer

LENGTH: 359 words


DAYTON - After bringing in $9.1 million last year by auctioning 2,000 delinquent
tax liens, Montgomery County Treasurer Hugh Quill plans to sell another 2,000
certificates of judgments Nov. 18.

The targets of Quill's sale are landowners with unpaid taxes. Quill's goal is to
provide more funds for schools, government agencies and other entities supported
by local property taxes.

A list of 5,000 delinquent properties and their owners was published last
Saturday and last Monday in the Dayton Daily News. Those publications prompted
banks and financial companies to begin contacting the property owners. But Quill
warned owners Friday to be wary of so-called "predatory lenders."

"These lenders may try to take advantage of the homeowner's financial situation
by offering loans that my ultimately put their property at risk," Quill said.
"Property owners should carefully research all lenders ... and remember that any
deal that 'looks too good to be true' probably is."

Selling tax liens does not involve sale of the property itself. Landowners have
a year to repay the delinquent taxes in full, along with any interest and
additional fees. If the landowner does not redeem the lien within a year of the
sale of the lien, the lien holder can begin foreclosure proceedings, a legal
process that ends with the sale of the property at auction.

Quill said his office will work with property owners who are having trouble.

"Our goal is not to increase the number of foreclosures in our county, but
instead, we want to make sure that we protect families from predatory lenders
and keep them in their homes," Quill said.

Paying taxes You can pay taxes by mail or at 451 W. Third St. Cash is accepted
at the counter. A cashier's check or money order may be mailed or brought in. A
white county mailbox in front of 451 W. Third St. may be used for checks or
money orders only. The office staff accepts Discover Card, but charges an
additional convenience fee.

Visa, MasterCard and American Express can be used by calling 1-800-2PAY TAX
(800) 272-9829, followed by entering the jurisdiction code 4530 and the voice
prompts that follow it. A convenience charge will be added.

Delinquent taxes down from previous years

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

Jan. 12--PALO PINTO -- The county has fewer people on delinquent property tax
rolls.

"You've turned over 3.2 percent of the roll this year," tax attorney Charles
Brady told Palo Pinto County Commissioners Monday. "It keeps getting lower every
year."

Brady said when his firm took over collections on the county's delinquent tax
rolls about six years ago, collections were around 5 percent. The lower
percentage means the county is getting more of its money on time.

Revenue from collections amounted to $580,000, he said. Of the county's original
$18 million levy in 2014, about $290,000 is left to collect.

About 4 percent of the remaining taxes are in deferral, he said. These deferrals
are primarily for those age 65 and older and allow seniors to get late taxes
paid without a hefty pinch on often already limited budgets.

"These are really good numbers," he said.

The county is also avoiding the expense of litigation by working out payment
agreements and installment agreements, he said.

The county relies on revenue from property taxes, said Linda Tuggle, county tax
assessor-collector. Once property taxes are assessed, the county drafts its
budget accordingly.

"When a tax goes uncollected, then part of a budget is unfunded," she said.

Each year on July 1, unpaid accounts are turned over to collections, she said.
The county uses the law firm Perdue, Brandon, Fielder, Collins & Mott for
collections.

This year, to avoid penalties and interest, 2015 property taxes are due by Feb.
1, she said.

Payments may be made between 8:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. weekdays at the tax office
in the courthouse, or in a drop box located in the Palo Pinto County
Annex/Poston Building at 109 N. Oak in Mineral Wells, Tuggle said. Mailed
payments must be postmarked Feb. 1 or earlier.

Additionally, credit or debit card payments may be made online at the county Web
site at www.co-palo-pinto.tx.us, she said. These payments are subject to
processing fees of up to 2.4 percent of the transaction amount.

Those qualifying for over 65 or disabled homestead exemptions may pay their
taxes with no penalty or interest in four installments due Feb. 1, March 31, May
31, and July 31, she said. Under this exemption, the first quarter of the
payment must be made by Feb. 1 and a note included with the payment informing
the tax office payments will be made in installments.

More information about tax bills is available from the tax office at
940-659-1271.

In other business, commissioners:

--Approved appointments of Ryan Dunn, Carolyn Land and Lynn Reasoner to the ESD
1 board.

BUDDY JOHNSON MAKES GOOD ON FINAL DELINQUENT TAX BILL

SECTION: TAMPA BAY; Pg. 1B

LENGTH: 285 words


For the first time in three years, Hillsborough Elections SupervisorBuddy
Johnson is up to date on his property taxes. Johnson paid his final delinquent
tax bill May 29, with a $7,559 payment for the 2007 taxes on a $476,800
penthouse unit at Rivo at Ringling Condominiums in Sarasota. In April, Johnson
paid $1,644 in back taxes on a former home and adjoining lot in Plant City that
he sold last year. He also paid a $1,736 delinquent tax bill on 20 acres he
purchased off Thonotosassa Road for $800,000. Johnson is awaiting word on
whether Hillsborough Property Appraiser Rob Turner will approve an agricultural
tax exemption on the 20-acre tract, where Johnson gave grazing rights to a cow
exhibitor for $20 a year.

Tax collectors say peer pressure getting results; Behavioural strategies woo
delinquents 'to do the right thing' and settle debts

BYLINE: NANETTE BYRNES, Reuters

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. B15

LENGTH: 571 words


Can peer pressure make delinquent taxpayers pony up what they owe the
government?

Behavioural economists say it can, and some tax agencies in both the United
States and Britain are taking their advice to heart - and finding that they are
reaping rewards.

From the simple rewording of late notices to changing the structure of back-tax
payment plans, tax collectors are getting results by tapping into basic human
tendencies. Whether it is the desire to do what peers do or to stick with a
voluntary commitment, persistent patterns of human conduct revealed by
behavioural economics are gradually being targeted to boost tax revenues at very
low cost.

"People forget the basis of our system is voluntary compliance," said Ted
London, a California-based specialist in taxation with information technology
consultancy CGI Group Inc.

"The vast majority of people want to do the right thing. If government can make
it easier to understand what that is, it can have a big impact," he said.

Behavioural economists study how social and emotional factors influence economic
decisions.

These researchers' insights have undermined orthodox economic theories that
assume consumers and investors make decisions based solely on material
self-interest.

Tax administrators traditionally have focused on penalties to compel compliance.
That remains important, but audits and legal enforcement action are expensive.
Behavioural strategies can help do the job at far lower cost, experts said.

Psychologist Robert Ciald-ini, a professor at Arizona State University and an
expert in persuasion, pioneered the social insight that if people know what
their peers are doing, they are more likely to do the same.

Applying that insight, the British tax agency has tested different form letters
on delinquent taxpayers.

In one letter, this sentence - "Nine out of 10 people in the U.K. pay their tax
on time" - increased positive response by 1.5 per cent.

Adding another sentence - "You are one of the few who have not paid us yet" -
raised the success rate 3.9 per cent.

The agency also found compliance rose 6.8 per cent when taxpayers were told they
were one of few delinquents in their hometowns.

Its work is led by its Behavioural Insights Team, which is advised by University
of Chicago Professor Richard Thaler, a founder of the field of behavioural
finance.

Other tax administrators have caught on to these ideas on their own.

A push for "plain English" in tax forms over the past decade has led the
Washington State Department of Revenue toward behavioural ideas of salience, the
idea that people focus only on what they understand.

After rewriting the department's form letter sent to firms believed to owe tax
on the use of goods or services, positive responses from taxpayers increased 43
per cent.

Washington State's first-ever tax amnesty program was also written by experts in
plain language. It recently generated $321 million in new tax revenue for the
state.

Structuring late payments is another area where understanding behaviour can have
an impact.

After employers began structuring retirement savings plans in a way that
required employees to opt out, rather than opt in, participation in the plans
jumped.

California saw a similar result some years ago when the state started requiring
tax payment plans be structured as electronic bank account withdrawals. Though
taxpayers could cancel, they tended not to. Missed payments are now only five
per cent.

the published list of real
             63      property to be offered and cry the sale by reference to the

             65          (2) (a) The tax commission shall establish, by rule,

             69      the delinquent property that best protect the financial
interest of the delinquent property owner
             70      and meet the needs of local governments to collect
delinquent property taxes due.
             71          (3) The county governing body may authorize the auditor
to combine for sale two or
             72      more contiguous parcels owned by the same party when:
             73          (a) the parcels are a single economic or functional
unit;
             74          (b) the combined sale will best protect the financial
interests of the delinquent property
             75      owner; and

the unit.
             77          (4) The governing body may accept any of the following
bids:
             78          (a) the highest bid amount for the entire parcel of
property, however, a bid may not be
             79      accepted for an amount which is insufficient to pay the
taxes, penalties, interest, and
             80      administrative costs; or
             81          (b) a bid in an amount sufficient to pay the taxes,
penalties, interest, and administrative
             82      costs, for less than the entire parcel.
             83          (i) The bid which shall be accepted shall be the bid of
the bidder who will pay in cash
             84      the full amount of the taxes, penalties, interest, and
administrative costs for the smallest portion
             85      of the entire parcel.
             86          (ii) The county auditor at the tax sale or the county
legislative body following the tax
             87      sale shall reject a bid to purchase a strip of property
around the entire perimeter of the parcel,
             88      or a bid to purchase a strip of the parcel which would
prevent access to the remainder of the
             89      parcel by the redemptive owner or otherwise unreasonably
diminish the value of that

90      remainder.
             91          (iii) If the bid accepted is for less than the entire
parcel, the auditor shall note the fact,
             92      with a description of the property covered by the bid, upon
the tax sale record and the balance
             93      of the parcel not affected by the bid shall be considered
to have been redeemed by the owner.
             94          (5) The county legislative body may decide that none of
the bids are acceptable.
             95          (6) Once the county auditor has [closed the sale of a
particular parcel of property as a
             96      result of accepting] accepted a bid on the parcel, the
successful bidder or purchaser of the
             97      property may not unilaterally rescind the bid. The county
legislative body, after acceptance of
             98      a bid, may enforce the terms of the bid by obtaining a
legal judgment against the purchaser in
             99      the amount of the bid, plus interest and attorneys' fees.

Unclaimed Property Act.
             105          [(8)] (9) All money received upon the sale of property
made under this section shall be
             106      paid into the county treasury, and the treasurer shall
settle with the taxing entities as provided
             107      in Section 59-2-1366 .
             108          [(9)] (10) (a) The county auditor shall, after

Surprising list of El Paso's delinquent taxpayers

BYLINE: By David Crowder / El Paso Times

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 1043 words


Asarco, El Paso's newest hospital, the Tiguas and the man who owns more historic
buildings than anyone else in town are among the city's top 20 delinquent
taxpayers.

The city's tax office, which collects property taxes for all 29 taxing entities
in El Paso County, sent out tax notices last year for $718 million in all, of
which about $22 million -- or 3 percent -- has gone delinquent.

In all, according to the city's consolidated tax records, more than $63 million
in delinquent taxes is owed to those jurisdictions.

"We've already collected $719 million in current and delinquent taxes this
fiscal year, and of the $63 million that is delinquent, we'll probably collect
$20 million to $21 million in the next 12 months," City Tax Assessor-Collector
Juan Sandoval said.

The top 20 delinquent accounts total $4.7 million, of which $719,198 is owed to
the city.

"I would say most are in bankruptcy, in lawsuits for nonpayment, or they just
became delinquent and have been turned over to our attorneys," Sandoval said.

At the top of this list is Albuquerque-based Roadrunner Trucking Inc., which was
among the biggest trucking companies in the nation before it went out of
business in 2005.

"They're not in bankruptcy, but we have a court judgment on that account, which
became delinquent in 2004," Sandoval said.

Today, Mesilla Valley Trucking is operating on Roadrunner's former site at 7440
Doniphan.

Physician's Hospital East, which filed for bankruptcy this year, is second on
the list at $579,525 when its delinquent personal property taxes for 2006 are
combined with the unpaid taxes on real estate listed under Physicians Specialty
Hospital's account at the same address, 1416 George Dieter.

"There's a bankruptcy pending," said Dr. O.R. Brooker, who is among the
hospital's owners. "There are bidders that are going to be bidding on the
hospital. There will be an auction ... that I suspect will be in October."

Brooker said the high-tech, 40-bed hospital had a great location in an area of
the city that is medically underserved, but it could not attract enough doctors.

"There's a shortage of physicians in El Paso, and it's hard to get people to
move their business somewhere else," Brooker said. "Recently, the hospital has
been doing well, breaking even and close to a profit."

Fourth on the list at $375,815 is Asarco, which filed for bankruptcy in 2004 and
has not paid that year's taxes on 22 accounts for equipment and properties
contiguous to the plant.

"They have paid for '05 and '06, but their bankruptcy plan has not been
approved, so that's why they're not making any payments," Sandoval said. "They
are current except for that one year."

Heritage Automotive, fifth on the list with $211,550 delinquent on 22 accounts
for 2003 and 2004, filed for bankruptcy in 2004.

Also in bankruptcy is Delphi Automotive Systems, the General Motors supplier,
which owes $204,075 in taxes for 2005, the year it filed for bankruptcy
protection.

The corporation that owns El Paso's premier Downtown hotel, the Camino Real, is
ninth on the list at $165,064 -- one year's delinquency.

The hotel's taxable valuation dropped from $11.7 million last year to $9.2
million this year, indicating a valuation challenge.

South-West city Rep. Beto O'Rourke said he was disturbed to hear that the
biggest and oldest Downtown hotel is behind in its taxes at a time when the city
is trying to revitalize the area.

He said that the city has been concerned about the hotel for some time and that
last year, he met with the Camino Real's general manager, Michelle Kaip, to
voice his concerns about the hotel's condition.

"She assured me they are committed to bringing that hotel back up to the
community's expectations," he said.

Kaip said she could not discuss the delinquent taxes because a lawsuit is
pending that involves taxes.

"I will tell you we have completed a multimillion renovation earlier this year,
so the hotel is in great shape now," she said. "As far as our financial
viability, we are doing very well."

On the tax rolls, the Camino Real is owned by Hotel Paso del Norte Inc. Kaip
said it is owned by Camino Real Hotels and Resorts, a Mexico City corporation
that owns more than 20 hotels in Mexico and one in the United States, El Paso's
Camino Real.

The Tigua Indian reservation, Ysleta del Sur Pueblo, is No. 17 on the list and
owes $113,611 in back taxes on 45 property accounts, Sandoval said.The tribe has
payment agreements on every account that Sandoval checked.

And 18th on the delinquency list is William D. "Billy" Abraham, who owes
$112,411 in back taxes on two properties, the Newberry Building at 201 Stanton
and the historic but vacant 1880s railroad depot at Campbell Street and
Interstate 10.

Abraham said he is protesting the valuation on both buildings and has paid the
taxes on the uncontested value.

He owns nearly 20 historic buildings in the Downtown area, and is being
prosecuted by the city over code violations at a number of them. The city has
initiated eminent domain proceedings against him to take possession of the
Albert Fall Mansion, alleging Abraham has allowed it to fall into serious
disrepair.

Central Appraisal District records show a protest is active on the Newberry
Building, the valuation of which was raised to $800,525 this year from last
year's $685,865.

The protest over the former depot's value appears to be concluded, and it is
listed on the appraisal roll at $809,048, about $10,000 higher than last year's
value.

Sandoval said the city aggressively pursues delinquent taxes, through the law
firm hired to handle collections and tax lawsuits: Delgado, Acosta, Spencer,
Linebarger and Perez.

After July 1, a 20 percent surcharge is applied to tax accounts that go
delinquent each year and, when the taxes, penalty and interest are paid -
whether legal action has been taken or not -- that surcharge goes to the law
firm.

Last year, the firm received $3.5 million in collection fees, and the firm has
been paid that much through July for the first 11 months of this fiscal year,
Sandoval said.

"There are accounts that are easy to collect," Sandoval said. "But, there are
other accounts that are not resolved for years that take a considerable amount
of effort to collect."

Mayoral hopeful Lopez owes big debt

BYLINE: Ignazio Messina, The Blade, Toledo, Ohio

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 1258 words


June 28--Toledo mayoral hopeful Anita Lopez -- the top Lucas County official
charged with assessing property values -- has the  and the highest debt among
the major candidates running for the city's top office this year, and she is the
only one whose seven-year credit report is riddled with late bill-paying.

Ms. Lopez, a Democrat, made her finances public Thursday, three days after
Councilman D. Michael Collins and Mayor Mike Bell and a day after Democratic
Councilman Joe McNamara released recent credit scores, credit reports, and tax
returns.

Her credit score is 621 according to Experian, 631 according to TransUnion, and
635 according to Equifax, which are three popular credit-reporting companies.
Ms. Lopez, the Lucas County auditor, declined an interview request Thursday. Her
credit score is considered "fair."

Ms. Lopez's credit report said she has up to 13 "open accounts," 11 of which
have balances totaling $261,432. Equifax said she has 14 negative accounts;
TransUnion listed 17 negative accounts, and Experian said there were eight
negative accounts.

"Most lenders would consider you to be a high risk," the credit report said.
"You may have difficulty qualifying for conventional loans and credit cards --
and when you do qualify for credit, you will be charged high interest rates."

Her total credit-card debt appeared to be about $10,000, according to the
report.

Ms. Lopez owes between $116,868 and $118,1157 for her home mortgage, according
to her credit report. The mortgage payments were reported 30 days past due three
times: in February, 2012, February, 2011, and December, 2010.

She has an open loan with Toledo Metro Federal Credit Union for her vehicle, for
which she owes about $34,060 and has a $831 monthly payment for a Jeep
Commander. She had a vehicle repossessed, but that blemish does not appear on
her credit report because it was more than seven years ago, Lopez campaign
spokesman Diane May said.

Ms. Lopez also owes money for student loans from her time at University of
Toledo's undergraduate and law schools. She graduated from law school in 1997,
three years after she received her bachelor of arts degree in political science
from UT. The loans are divided into four accounts with balances of $13,386,
$41,283, $23,540, and $21,899 for a total of $100,108. The student loan accounts
were 60 days past due seven times, and 30 days past due twice.

Her revolving accounts -- those with a credit limit and require a minimum
payment every month like a credit card -- included late payments.

A "CAP1/BSTBY" account, which appeared to be a credit card opened in 2005," has
a $2,586 balance. It was reported delinquent in February, 2011, and August,
2010.

A Capital One account opened in 1998 had a $2,327 balance and was reported
delinquent in September, 2011, and October, 2011.

Her open accounts also include:

-- A "Capital One/Furniture Row" account opened in March, 2009. It has a $2,542
balance and was reported delinquent in June, 2011.

-- A "HSBC Furniture Row" account has a zero balance. It was reported delinquent
in July, 2011.

-- A "Kohls/Capital One" account has a $808 balance and was delinquent in
February, 2012, October, 2011, and June, 2011.

-- A "THD/CBNA" account with a $844 balance was 30 days delinquent seven times
according to Equifax and Experian.

A closed account with "Ally Financial" had a zero balance but showed four
payments that were 30 days past due.

Another account listed as "BONY/ELT/ELABTI/GLHEC," has a zero balance and was
reported one time as past due 90 days.

A closed account with "TD Auto Finance" was reported twice as delinquent, 30
days each.

Her closed accounts included a Fifth Third Bank credit card that was late in
February; a Bank of America account that was reported delinquent twice, and an
American Express card that was reported 90 days past due 16 times over the past
seven years by Experian, but was not reported late by the other two companies.

By comparison to Ms. Lopez's credit score of 621, Mr. McNamara's credit score is
747, considered "very good" on the FICO range that goes from 300 to 850. He
obtained the score from TransUnion while Ms. Lopez used Equifax to get all three
scores.

Mr. Collins and Mr. Bell, both independents, obtained credit scores under the
"VantageScore" model, which is the name of a credit-rating product offered by
the three major credit bureaus -- Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion.

The top VantageScore is 990. Multiplying a VantageScore by 0.86 translates it
into an approximate FICO score. Mr. Collins' credit report showed a 916 score
and Mr. Bell's was 927. Translated to the FICO model, Mr. Collins would have a
787 score and Mr. Bell would have a 797 score.

The other candidates would not comment on Ms. Lopez's finances.

Mr. Collins, who was first to released his credit report and tax returns,
followed several hours later by Mayor Bell, said it was not his intention to
create such a "compelling situation" for the others. "I did it because I felt it
was important that I defined my position on transparency by being transparent
myself," Mr. Collins said. "I think this is in all fairness critical to the
voters. I am pleased that the other three candidates have all followed my path."

Mayor Mike Bell, through a spokesman, declined to comment on Ms. Lopez's
financial information. Andrew Grunwald, Mr. McNamara's campaign manager, instead
attacked Ms. Lopez for union contracts negotiated under Ms. Lopez. "The real
issue is that Lopez is the only county politician to give raises at a time when
nobody else is," he said. "It's a sign of fiscal responsibility, of how you are
going to treat the taxpayers money, or in Lopez's case, the lack of her fiscal
responsibility."

He also would not comment on her personal financial information.

Ms. Lopez filed an extension for her 2012 tax returns. Her 2011 tax documents
showed $79,127 in salary from her elected job as Lucas County auditor and $7,000
in alimony for a total of $86,127. She listed $2,113 in charitable donations.

Mr. McNamara, a lawyer who collects up to a $27,500 annual council salary, did
not release his 2012 tax returns since he too filed an extension. His 2011 tax
returns showed $35,375 in total income. Of that $24,091 was from wages and
salary, $13,721 was from ordinary dividends, and $448 was from taxable refunds,
credits, or offsets of state and local taxes. Mr. McNamara reported a $1,646
business income loss and $1,500 capital gain loss. He did not itemize charitable
donations.

According to their joint 2012 federal tax return, Mr. Collins and his wife --
Sandra Drabik, who is retired from the University of Toledo -- made a combined
$205,244 last year. That includes Ms. Drabik's retirement benefits and $5,168
from Social Security benefits collected by Mr. Collins. His 2012 income included
$42,247 from his pension from almost three decades as a Toledo police officer,
$23,797 from his Toledo City Council salary, and $1,783 from Lourdes University.
He gave $4,791 in charitable donations last year, the documents show.

Mayor Bell's 2012 federal tax return showed $108,481 in salary; $31 from taxable
interest; $541 from taxable refunds, credits, or offsets of state and local
income taxes, and $69,395 from pensions and annuities. He gave $8,584 in
charitable donations last year, the documents stated.

EDITORIAL: Put deadbeat garbage bills into database

BYLINE: Erie Times-News, Pa.

SECTION: COMMENTARY

LENGTH: 521 words


Jan. 07--Advertisement

City of Erie residents are justifiably upset that charges for garbage pickup
will increase to balance the 2014 budget. Erie City Council approved the higher
garbage fee as part of the city budget on Dec. 18.

Garbage fees will increase from $48 to $55 a quarter, but the higher rates are
only in effect for one year. The "sunset" provision also applies to higher sewer
fees, which will increase from an average of $61.50 a quarter to $70.45 a
quarter in the new budget.

Council approved the one-year limit on the fee hikes to prod Erie Mayor Joe
Sinnott's administration to become more aggressive in collecting overdue garbage
bills and to push for new agreements with Millcreek, Summit, Harborcreek and
Fairview townships, and Wesleyville Borough, which use the city's sewage
treatment plant.

City Council members would like the city to raise charges for the suburban
sewage customers, even if that means a court fight. That issue is best left to
the city's legal experts. The garbage fees are another matter. Erie residents
are angry because the city is owed more than $2 million in delinquent garbage
bills. A 2010 Erie Times-News investigation revealed $1.2 million in delinquent
garbage bills. The database created by our reporter showed that one landlord
owed $13,341 for 11 different accounts.

The newspaper's investigation prompted elected officials to promise action.
"It's important to figure out a strategy to combat these delinquencies," City
Councilwoman Jessica Horan-Kunco said in March 2010. "We can't just accept it."
Yet almost four years later, the city has an even higher amount of unpaid
garbage bills.

Sinnott is pondering whether to create an online database listing delinquent
garbage customers. Giving the public easy access to those records could prompt
some delinquent customers to pay up. The database might also discourage others
from skipping their payments.

The city of Scranton used this method to force payment on 4,624 delinquent
garbage accounts in October. The city published the names, addresses and dollar
amounts owed in the Scranton Times-Tribune on Oct. 14. The delinquency list of
overdue accounts, from 2002 to 2011, ran for 15 pages in the newspaper, the
Times-Tribune reported. The amount owed in Scranton was much higher than Erie's
delinquencies -- $7.8 million.

Scranton's searchable database lists all city garbage customers; you can
customize the search to find the accounts with a balance. Visit
www.scrantongov.com and click on the treasury department link to access the
database. This is the type of e-government service we have been urging the city
of Erie to embrace for years.

A year before Scranton turned to the database to publicize garbage fee
delinquencies, Scranton embarked on an aggressive collection program that cut
the number of delinquent accounts from 7,800 to 3,200. Erie must use both
methods -- aggressive collections and publicity about delinquent accounts -- to
finally get this problem under control.

Brown County property a bargain at delinquent tax sale

BYLINE: Laura Lane, Herald-Times, Bloomington, Ind.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 649 words


Oct. 19--NASHVILLE -- More than 100 bidders showed up last week at Brown
County's first delinquent tax sale in eight years, hoping to snatch up property
and houses for a bargain.

During Thursday's auction, a Fort Wayne man who makes a living buying tax sale
properties spent $1.4 million to purchase 43 of the 215 properties that were on
the auction block. Bidding started at the amount of taxes owed, but in many
cases grew far beyond that. For example, he bought one parcel with $10,000 in
back taxes for $132,000 and another with $16,000 in taxes owed for $145,000.

The original owners have one year to redeem their property by paying the
delinquent taxes plus a 10-percent or 15-percent fee. During that 12 months, the
tax-sale buyers are not allowed to go onto the property or contact the current
owners.

The days before the tax sale brought dozens of people to the county office
building with cash, credit cards and certified checks to save their property at
the last minute. Brown County Treasurer Joe Wray, conducting his first tax sale,
said he collected $360,000 in late taxes last Tuesday and another $250,000 on
Wednesday.

Even Thursday, the day of the sale, people rushed in to pay what they owed -- a
total of $84,000 was received -- with hopes of having their parcels removed from
the sale. "As long as we could get upstairs and get it off the table we could
pull it," Wray said. "We had one guy come in, his property was being sold for
$3,400, and he was but 10 minutes away from it being auctioned off," Wray said.

Because of reassessment troubles that plagued the county for years, tax bills
were not sent out and many people just didn't pay. Once the mess was
straightened out, they found themselves facing tax bills from several years
rolled into one.

In a struggling economy, property owners got behind, then found their homes at
risk.

The original list of delinquent tax properties generated late this summer had
more than 1,200 parcels. By tax sale day, the number was down to 215. Of those,
160 sold and 55 did not.

Among them is a piece of land that represents the county's biggest property tax
debt: the Little Nashville Opry, which burned to the ground in September 2009 in
a mysterious arson fire. Even though the building is gone and the lot on Ind. 46
west of Nashville is vacant, the owners had not paid property taxes for years
and currently owe $88,500.

That property and the others that did not sell could be sold at the 2011 tax
sale or purchased by the county.

One of the late payers was the owner of Mike's Music and Dance Barn, a venue
between Bloomington and Nashville that hosts concerts and offers country line
dancing on its 2,500-square-foot red oak dance floor.

Mike Robertson owed $19,000 in delinquent taxes and raised the money by selling
assets, refinancing and hosting an Oct. 3 benefit buffet and concert. The land
he owed taxes on has been in his family four generations.

"Mr. Robertson came in on Wednesday and paid it off,'" Wray said of the tax
debt. "We were able to take his property off the sale list."

Wray said that as the county's treasurer, he knows people have been warned; they
knew their property taxes were coming due. And his office offered a payment plan
to help property owners out.

As a citizen, though, he feels bad. "But they have a chance, a whole year, to
come in and redeem their property so that's what I hope they do. I understand
that people are in bad financial situations."

Volusia tax-certificate sale begins Monday

SECTION: SECTION B; Pg. 2B

LENGTH: 294  words


Online bidding begins Monday for Volusia County's more than $54.2 million in
delinquent tax certificates this year. The sale at bidvolusia.com closes May 30.

Revenue Director Peggy Flomerfelt, said the delinquencies are up more than 34
percent during last year.

The auction is not a sale of land but of liens against properties for the amount
of delinquent real estate taxes, plus interest and fees. A tax certificate
holder can call for sale of a property if a tax certificate has not been
redeemed within two years.

This year, those vying for the investments will find 23,096 properties not
up-to-date on their tax bills.

Information on the delinquent properties, such as payment history, property
description, aerial photos and maps is available online. Complete printed
listings will be available in The Volusia Review for three weeks.

As to individuals who find their properties on the delinquency list, Flomerfelt
said to avoid the sale, tax payments, plus fees and interest, must be in the
county's hands by 5 p.m. May 29.

Flomerfelt's office also has published a list of 6,169 parcels with 2007
delinquent tangible personal property taxes totaling $1,998,393.16.

CU RE Failures Not Widespread

BYLINE: By BRAD FINKELSTEIN

SECTION: Pg. 1

LENGTH: 810 words

DATELINE: NEW YORK


The failure of three Massachusetts credit unions in the past 18 months due to
problem commercial and residential real estate loans is not an omen of things to
come, say observers.

In fact, mortgage lending is growing for many credit unions, especially with the
opening of conduits such as CUNA Mortgage Co., Madison, Wis., which allow
smaller credit unions to sell loans to the secondary market.

As a whole the industry has done well.  Its mortgage portfolio has a delinquency
rate (60 days or more) of 1.46% as of year-end 1991, according to the Credit
Union National Association, an industry trade group in Madison that operates
CUNA Mortgage.

This is a slight increase from 1.36% at year-end 1990.

According to data provided by W.C. Ferguson & Co. there were 1,346 credit unions
that reported delinquencies in 1991 with an industrywide total of $ 345.8
million.

However, credit unions in New England and Massachusetts in particular have had a
tougher time because of the economy and because they have a longer history of
real estate lending than those in other parts of the country.

Keith Peterson, CUNA senior economist said most credit unions do not make
commercial real estate mortgages with the exception of those in Massachusetts.

Credit unions there classified 4.5% of their loans as commercial; the national
average is 1.2%.

The delinquency rate for first mortgage loans by Massachusetts credit unions is
4.0%.

Other real estate owned for all credit unions is 0.08% of assets; in
Massachusetts, it is 0.38%.

According to the Ferguson data taken from call reports filed at the end of 1991,
of the credit unions will the highest number of delinquent first mortgage loans
in portfolio, the top three, and four of the top ten are Massachusetts
institutions; two others in the top ten are from Rhode Island.

The New York metropolitan area accounts for three of the top ten, with one in
San Diego.

Topping the list is Progressive Consumers Federal Credit Union, Malden, Mass.,
with a total of $ 15.6 million in delinquent first mortgages, and more than $ 90
million in total delinquent loans at the end of 1991.

The second is Bridgewater (Mass.,) Credit Union with $ 9.7 million followed by
Brockton (Mass.) Credit Union with $ 7.7 million.

Progressive Consumers has been operating under NCUA conservatorship for the past
18 months; a recent NCUA estimate has the bad loan portfolio down to between $
60 million and $ 70 million.

During the same period NCUA liquidated two other Massachusetts credit unions
because of their problems with commercial real estate loans; Barnstable
Community Credit Union, Hyannis, Mass. and Blue Hill Credit Union, Brookline,
Mass.

In the case of Barnstable, regulators discovered that management had committed
fraud in making a number of commercial real estate loans, said Layne Bumgardner,
NCUA regional administrator.

According to the last available data for Barnstable, which had $ 63.4 million in
assets at year-end 1990, it had $ 12.6 million in all types of delinquent loans
and $ 5.0 million in delinquent first mortgage loans.

Blue Hill had assets of $ 115.6 million as of June 30, 1991; it had $ 29.9
million in total delinquencies and $ 13.3 million in first mortgage
delinquencies.

Yet a number of observers, regulators and analysis say the situations involving
Progressive Consumers, Barnstable and Blue Hill are isolated instances unlikely
to be repeated.

Mr. Bumgardner said Progressive Consumers was one of the few credit unions that
jumped into condominium and development real estate lending, the same areas that
helped sink many thrifts.

This type of lending "is not a typical credit union situation," he explained.

Rob Kimmett, vice president of public relations for the Massachusetts Credit
Union Association, added that Progressive Consumers also was using subpar
underwriting standards and other criteria.

Progressive Consumers "was a bit out of character for a credit union," he said.

The Massachusetts economy has left those credit unions which lent on real estate
to take some lumps but no more than any other institution, he said.

Industry experts agree that despite the situation at Progressive Consumers,
credit unions are not going to go down the same paths as thrifts.

Mr. Peterson said he does not see a national problem and one reason is the
development of a secondary market, a point Mr. Kimmett agreed with.

By getting involved in the secondary market, Mr. Kimmett said credit unions are
learning how to insulate themselves from problem mortgages.

Furthermore, in underwriting the loans, credit unions are now forced to use
standards set by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. and the Federal National
Mortgage Association as well as other private conduits, he said.

The future of Progressive Consumers CU should be sorted out in the next few
months.

State waives penalties, cuts interest in effort to collect back taxes

BYLINE: Brad Bumsted

LENGTH: 426 words


HARRISBURG -- More than 130,000 businesses and people in Southwestern
Pennsylvania are among tax cheats targeted by a $3 million statewide television
advertising campaign designed to help collect back taxes.

Gov. Ed Rendell yesterday set in motion Pennsylvania's first tax forgiveness
program in 14 years with a state-paid ad to persuade tax delinquents to pay with
no penalty and half of the interest during a 54-day period ending June 18.

"Find us before we find you," Rendell said in Pittsburgh announcing the tax
amnesty program.

According to the Department of Revenue, Allegheny County has 79,484 state tax
delinquents; Westmoreland County, 16,732; Washington County, 10,726; Beaver
County, 8,362; Butler County, 8,185; Fayette County, 6,100; Indiana County,
3,257; Armstrong County, 2,588; and Greene County, 1,500.

Revenue expected to come in during the amnesty is a key component in the
2010-2011 state budget, accounting for an estimated $190 million.

Rendell initially opposed the program, expressing skepticism over its ability to
raise that much money. But he signed on as lawmakers struggled to come up with a
deal last October to end a 101-day budget impasse.

"I did oppose it because it's speculative," Rendell said. "To be honest, I
wasn't aware the extent (of unpaid taxes) was $2.1 billion. We had done such a
good job of collecting, I wasn't sure there was that much out there."

The TV ads suggest "we're coming after you anyway," Rendell said. The ads using
computer technology show an aerial view of the United States that eventually
focuses in on a property in Pennsylvania.

Of tax delinquents, 62 percent are corporations, according to the governor's
office.

"No one is going to get away with not paying their taxes," Rendell said.
"Everyone will pay more than if they had paid their taxes on time."

About 1 million tax delinquents owe $2.1 billion. Roughly 20 percent reside out
of state.

An estimated 97 percent of Pennsylvanians pay their taxes on time, Rendell said.

Rep. John Bear, R-Lancaster, who spearheaded the effort, said he is glad Rendell
is on board. In the end, what counts is if it "helps taxpayers and reduces
delinquencies," Bear said.

A person who owes $1,500 in back taxes normally would owe $2,044 with penalties
and interest. Under the program, that delinquent taxpayer would owe $1,584,
Rendell said.

A corporation owing $4,000 in back taxes faces $5,983 in penalties and interest.
If the company takes advantage of the tax forgiveness program, the company would
owe $4,131 -- a difference of $1,852, Rendell said.

Businesses owe Pa. $6.6M in back taxes

BYLINE: By RICHARD FELLINGER Evening Sun Harrisburg Bureau

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 638 words


At a time when every dollar of state revenue counts, officials are trying to
track down nearly $6.6 million in delinquent taxes from more than 200 businesses
in Pennsylvania.

The Department of Revenue last week updated its tax-delinquent list, which shows
225 businesses that failed to pay certain taxes to the state. Each business
collected either sales taxes from its customers or withholding taxes from its
employees, or both.

Three York County businesses are among the delinquent taxpayers. They are Smokey
Joe's Barbeque Grille of York, which was listed for owing $24,474; B&T Towing
and Auto Repair of Brogue for owing $16,309; and RW Auto Repair of Etters for
owing $9,126. No Adams County businesses are listed.

Businesses owing the state the most are Crisman Harwood Flooring of Pottstown,
which was listed for owing $175,032; New Jersey-based Sequel Solutions Plus for
owing $161,265; and K&D Jewelers of Bethlehem for owing $139,460.

Thirty-eight businesses were added last week to the list, which is updated
quarterly. The new listings include East Penn Container Decorating of Berks
County, owing $94,861.

While the state faces a budget crisis that developed in recent months, the list
is not new. State officials created it in 2006, hoping the publicity and
accompanying court action would pressure businesses into paying up.

State officials file a lien against each business in county court, which
essentially freezes their finances and ensures the state gets paid if the
business is sold.

And the state promotes the list. When the updated list was released last week,
Acting Revenue Secretary Stephen Stetler encouraged people to check it out on
the department's Web site at www.revenue.state.pa.us.

While $6.6 million is a small fraction of the state's $28 billion budget, the
delinquent taxes serve up a reminder that the state is scraping to get through
this year. Gov. Ed Rendell has estimated a $2.3 billion budget shortfall this
year, and he has cut programs and frozen most state hiring to help cover it.

State officials give delinquent businesses several chances to pay up, revenue
department spokeswoman Elizabeth Brassell said. Revenue officials contact each
business several times and also offer them a payment plan to catch up, she said.

Often just the threat of being put on the list encourages business owners to
pay, Brassell said. Since the list was started, delinquent businesses have paid
$87 million and started payments plans for an additional $20.7 million after
being threatened with the list, she said.

Yet collecting from some businesses can be hard, because some go out of
business.

Among them is Smokey Joe's Barbeque Grille, which closed last summer. A message
left at a forwarding phone number for owner Joseph Whitehead was not returned
for this story.

Other owners don't like to talk about their situation. A woman at B&T Towing &
Auto hung up when contacted by phone for this story.

RT Auto Repair in Etters has no listed phone number and could not be reached.

Still others say they've fallen on hard times and need a chance to catch up.

Karen Whitaker, co-owner of Lebanon's Whitaker Cleaning Systems, said the bad
economy has hurt their finances.

She said they want to pay their delinquent tax bill and have been trying. She
said their business had been on a payment plan to stay off the list but was
unable to keep the payments this winter.

The bad publicity hurts their business even more, Whitaker said.

"This is just making it worse for businesses," she said. "Businesses are
struggling now. I'm just mortified over this whole thing."

Brassell said revenue officials who track down the late taxes are doing a job
for the benefit of all taxpayers, and businesses that pay their taxes shouldn't
have to carry the burden for those that don't.

"It's really a matter of tax fairness as well," she said.

Many Boston Small Business Loans are Delinquent: Audit

BYLINE: Darren Waggoner

SECTION: CCR - DEALS & PRICING Vol. 1 No. 1

LENGTH: 609  words


Several hundred thousand dollars in loans have gone uncollected by the
small-business lending arm of the Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA), with
more than half of its loans seriously delinquent, according to an internal audit
obtained by The Boston Globe through a public records request.The audit of
taxpayer-funded nonprofit, the Boston Local Development Corp., comes after a
larger audit of the BRA that found the authority did not collect millions of
dollars in fees and lease payments from developers.Boston Local Development has
written off nearly $700,000 in bad loans since 2011. In one example, checks
collected from a borrower and totaling $235,000 were not cashed for six months,
according to the audit, which covered the fiscal year that ended June 2013. The
delinquent loans averaged more than $100,000 each.The audit also found that 51%
of the total amount borrowed has been delinquent for 90 days or longer, a rate
roughly more then 50 times greater than that of banks, which average less than
1% on similar loans, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.Boston
Local Development was founded in 1979 to promote economic development by
providing business loans, usually between $25,000 and $150,000. It has approved
$14 million in loans since 1996 to 139 businesses and created 2,800 jobs, an
average of 165 new jobs a year. The program currently has approximately $2
million available to lend through grants from local and federal agencies.The
loan program is a revolving fund, thus as money is paid back it is re-loaned to
others.

If it's not paid back, then there's less to lend unless the fund is replenished
by taxpayers or other sources.William Nickerson, chief financial manager at
Boston Local Development, defended the agency's collection policy. He said the
agency exists to create jobs by helping businesses succeed, so he is willing to
give more time to companies that have a chance at success. He noted that the
recession hampered borrowers' ability to repay and explains the high delinquency
rate.Nickerson said he has restructured or plans to restructure eight loans
totaling nearly $1 million to get borrowers paying on time. He cited the example
of HDM Systems Corp., a battery technology firm that received a $250,000 loan in
2008 at 5% interest. When the loan was due, Nickerson gave HDM an opportunity to
secure new contracts. The company recently paid $10,000, in addition to more
than $49,000 in principal and interest it already paid. It has agreed to make
interest payments over the next year, according to a BRA spokeswoman.Once the
new contracts start generating revenue, the authority will review HDM's finances
with the goal of moving the company to principal and interest payments,
officials said.The administration of Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh, meanwhile, is
reviewing putting more money into Boston Local Development to expand the lending
program. The plan is to reduce delinquencies by pairing small-business owners
with services provided by the Department of Neighborhood Development, where
entrepreneurs can get help building businesses.Boston Local Development's
highest profile case of loan delinquency involved the minority-owned Bay State
Banner newspaper. In August 2009, Thomas M. Menino, the mayor at the time, urged
the agency to approve loans to help the Banner avoid closing. The Banner did not
repay the loans when they came due in November 2011 and a monthly
interest-payment plan was established in January 2012. Another year, with just
one payment made, passed before the Banner was declared in default. The Banner
has made all interest payments since Feb. 1, according to the BRA.

City to tax delinquents: Stop freeloading

BYLINE: By JAN RANSOM; ransomj@phillynews.com 215-854-5218

SECTION: LOCAL; P-com Biggie News Update; Pg. 04

LENGTH: 354 words


The city yesterday continued its quest to publicly shame tax deadbeats as the
Revenue Department showcased its latest list of 38 delinquent bums that owe a
combined $5.5 million.

"They're stiffing the city," said mayoral spokesman Mark McDonald. "These folks
get high-quality services, police services . . . and they're not paying their
fair share. We're stepping it up to get the money that all taxpayers are
supposed to be paying. We have a right to that money."

The top-three tax deadbeats, according to the city, include Workforce Culture
Connections, Keystone Administrative Services and the Baker Funeral Home. Each
owes more than $400,000.

"Why do you want to patronize at a business like that if they're not paying
their taxes?" said Revenue Commissioner Keith Richardson. "We're trying to get
the word out."

Requests for comment from the businesses on the scofflaw list weren't returned
last night.

The quarterly list is part of the city's effort to proactively pursue tax
delinquents, Richardson said. Since the lists went public in 2008 exposing 300
delinquent businesses, the city has collected $4.4 million, McDonald said.

"We want to collect 100 percent [of the taxes owed] all of the time," Richardson
said.

Mayor Nutter began exposing tax evaders in November 2008, including a Center
City lawyer with whom he had a sidewalk showdown in March 2009, and the
Bustleton Podiatry Associates in Northeast Philadelphia last year.

Both have either paid what they owed or have a payment plan in place, city
officials said.

As part of a tax-amnesty program, the city sends letters to businesses and tries
to establish a payment plan. Businesses then have 20 to 25 days to come into
compliance before the list goes public. However, if a business takes no action,
the Sheriff's Office could sell its property.

Additionally, the Department of Licenses and Inspections can revoke business
licenses for failing to pay up. Businesses that have failed to pay wage, liquor,
hotel, amusement or parking taxes are being referred to the District Attorney's
Office for possible prosecution that could result in up to seven years in
prison.

Representatives push delinquent tax bill

BYLINE: Chris Lavender, Times-News, Burlington, N.C.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 294 words


Feb. 06--Alamance County could soon require the payment of delinquent property
taxes before recording deed transfers.

Rep. Dan Ingle, R-Alamance, and Rep. Alice Bordsen, D-Alamance, introduced state
House bill 38 on Thursday, which paves the way for Alamance County to join 71
counties to adopt a general statute already adopted by some counties statewide.

Ingle said the local bill was introduced based on a request from the Alamance
County Board of Commissioners to see delinquent property taxes paid before
recording deed transfers. For the local bill's introduction, Alamance County had
to join at least 15 other counties to ask for the bill to be approved.

"I think this should pass easily," Ingle said. "When the local delegation is
favorable towards a bill it usually has no problem passing."

Bordsen said the bill hasn't been sent to a committee yet, but will likely head
to committee soon for review after staff meets next week to discuss the details
of the bill.

"I don't see anything controversial about it," Bordsen said.

Alamance County Commissioner Bill Lashley said on Friday he supports the bill
and believes if it is approved by the General Assembly it will benefit the
county greatly. "I think it's a good thing," Lashley said. "The bill would allow
the county to get the taxes owed."

County holds annual tax sale

BYLINE: Eric Freeman, Columbus Telegram, Neb.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 541 words


March 08--COLUMBUS -- A total of 300 tax delinquent parcels valued at more than
$312,000 were up for auction at the Platte County Treasurer's annual Delinquent
Property Tax Sale Monday morning.

More than three dozen potential buyers were in attendance at the sale to secure
one or more tax certificates on those parcels.

Nebraska law provides for the sale of all real property with exception of mobile
homes, cabin trailers, manufactured homes or similar property assessed and taxed
as improvements to leased land.

The sale of delinquent property is offered on the first Monday in March on
properties with taxes due after that day.

The parcels could be offered one per day or at a sale similar to the annual
event held in Platte County. Anyone can offer to purchase the property
regardless of residency.

When a single bid is made the treasurer is permitted to accept the bid for the
entire property. When multiple bids are made on a single delinquent property,
the bidder who offers the smallest undivided portion of the tract as
compensation for payment of all delinquent taxes, interest and costs is the
purchaser.

An undivided interest means the buyer is entitled to that percentage of the
profits of the land; the tract will not be physically divided after a tax sale.

Under this scenario, the buyer and prior owner become co-owners of the entire
tract, with division of authority based on the extent of he buyer's undivided
interest.

If the property remains unsold for lack of bidders, the county board may
purchase the property and later assign it for compensation.

The buyer becomes entitled to a tax sale certificate upon payment of all
delinquent taxes by the buyer. The certificate includes the description, amount
paid and the redemption date. The buyer's interest is a perpetual lien against
the property which grows as the buyer pays additional taxes according to
Nebraska state law.

The law regarding delinquent tax property is structured to give the owner of the
property every possible opportunity to pay the delinquent taxes, interest and
costs. For this reason a tax sale certificate doe not in and of itself strip the
owner of their ownership.

The owner or any other individual with substantial interest such as a spouse,
tenants, or creditors can regain unencumbered ownership by paying the
certificate holder the amount on the certificate and any additional taxes due.
This option is available at any time prior to delivery of a tax deed or the
initiation of a foreclosure proceeding.

The time available to redeem a tax sale certificate and convert it to a tax sale
deed varies depending on the capacity of the prior owner and the buyer providing
properly timed notices to the previous owner.

More detailed information about the tax sale certificate processes and the
various criteria associated with the law is available at the Platte County
Treasurer's office in the courthouse, 2610 14th St.

Calypte Biomedical Corporation,  PROCEEDINGS AND
EC Development, Inc., and  NOTICE OF HEARING
Information Architects Corporation  PURSUANT TO SECTION
 (n/k/a Dakota Creative Group Corporation),  12(j) OF THE SECURITIES
  EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 Respondents.


I.

  The Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") deems it necessary and
appropriate for the protection of investors that public administrative
proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 12(j) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") against the Respondents named

II.

  After an investigation, the Division of Enforcement alleges that:

A. RESPONDENTS

1. Calypte Biomedical Corporation ("CBMC") (CIK No. 899426) is a Delaware
corporation located in Portland, Oregon with a class of securities registered
with the Commission pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(g). CBMC is delinquent
in its periodic filings with the Commission, having not filed any periodic
reports since it filed a Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2012, which
reported a net loss of $1,076,000 for the prior year. As of February 12, 2015,
the common stock of CBMC was quoted on OTC Link operated by OTC Markets Group
Inc. (formerly "Pink Sheets") ("OTC Link"), had eleven market makers, and was
eligible for the "piggyback" exception of Exchange Act Rule 15c2-11(f)(3).
2. EC Development, Inc. ("ECDI") (CIK No. 761034) is a delinquent Delaware
corporation located in Shawnee, Oklahoma with a class of securities registered
with the Commission pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(g). ECDI is delinquent
in its periodic filings with the Commission, having not filed any periodic
reports since it filed a Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2012,
which reported a net loss of $1,333,296 for the prior nine months. As of
February 12, 2015, the common stock of ECDI was quoted on OTC Link, had ten

3. Information Architects Corporation (n/k/a Dakota Creative Group Corporation)

Commission, having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 10-Q for
the period ended September 30, 2012, which reported a net loss of $1,397,232 for

was quoted on OTC Link, had eight market makers, and was eligible for the
"piggyback" exception of Exchange Act Rule 15c2-11(f)(3).
 B.  DELINQUENT PERIODIC FILINGS
4. As discussed in more detail above, all of the Respondents are delinquent in
their periodic filings with the Commission, have repeatedly failed to meet their
obligations to file timely periodic reports, and failed to heed delinquency
letters sent to them by the Division of Corporation Finance requesting

maintain a valid address on file with the Commission as required by Commission
rules, did not receive such letters.
5. Exchange Act Section 13(a) and the rules promulgated thereunder require
issuers of securities registered pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12 to file

if the registration is voluntary under Section 12(g). Specifically, Rule 13a-1
requires issuers to file annual reports, and Rule 13a-13 requires issuers to
file quarterly reports.
6. As a result of the foregoing, Respondents failed to comply with Exchange Act
Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.
III.

  In view of the allegations made by the Division of Enforcement, the Commission

Pittsburgh City Council may hire tax collector

BYLINE: Adam Brandolph

LENGTH: 318 words


Pittsburgh City Council on Wednesday took a step toward outsourcing collection
of unpaid taxes after the company said it would offer delinquent taxpayers
payment plans.

Officials believe a deal with Jordan Tax Service, which collects taxes for
Pittsburgh Public Schools, Allegheny County and the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer
Authority, will increase collection of unpaid or overdue taxes.

"I think (delinquent taxpayers) know now the city is serious about collecting,"
said City Treasurer Margaret Lanier.

If council approves the deal with Jordan next week, taxpayers would receive a
single bill from the school district, county, city and water and sewer authority
beginning in January.

As of Sept. 10, delinquent taxpayers owed the city $21 million, Lanier said.

Councilman Patrick Dowd said he initially was skeptical about the plan, but
supports hiring Jordan.

"We are essentially handing a baseball bat to the tax collector and saying, 'Be
more aggressive,' " Dowd said. His reservations about the deal were quelled, he
said, when Jordan agreed to inform all delinquent taxpayers of payment plans.

The firm will offer two-year installment plans for homeowners, 18-month plans
for landlords and one-year plans for owners of vacant, commercial or industrial
properties. Under the deal, Jordan would collect a fee of 10 percent of tax
bills.

Mayor Luke Ravenstahl lauded the deal and its potential to help erase blight
from city neighborhoods.

"Our goal here is not just to streamline the collection services, but to also
connect those who are experiencing tough economic times to available financial
housing counseling services," he said.

Controller Michael Lamb called it a "historic agreement."

County Treasurer John Weinstein said Jordan collects about $1 million a month
for the county and has collected $60 million for the county in the past five
years through payment plans with delinquent taxpayers.

Late Payments Climb to New Record

BYLINE: Amilda Dymi

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 6 Vol. 33 No. 24

LENGTH: 455  words


WASHINGTON-The national mortgage delinquency rate - which includes both prime
and subprime mortgages - climbed to a record 7.88% in the fourth quarter with
subprime late payments reaching a staggering 21.88%, according to new figures
released by the Mortgage Bankers Association.

Figures compiled by NMN show that Americans owe $9.6 trillion on their loans,
which means $756 billion in residential mortgage debt is delinquent. Also, $196
billion in subprime debt is 30 days or more, late.

Prime foreclosures started in the quarter increased to 1.88% of outstanding
loans, double last year's rate. The only positive in the numbers: the rate at
which homes are going into foreclosure was flat but as MBA chief economist Jay
Brinkmann noted, "This is mainly attributable to various state and local
moratoria on foreclosure sales" and similar actions taken bythe GSEs.

But even though the rate of foreclosures may be flat the foreclosure inventory
numbers are huge, 6.3% of all loans and 23.11% of subprime mortgages are
seriously delinquent or in foreclosure. The South and Midwest have the highest
delinquency rates, 9.4% and 8.58%, respectively.

No surprise, subprime ARMs continue to be a major problem. At year-end, only 52%
of all subprime ARMs were current.

But other loan types are going delinquent in record numbers as well. "When we
look at where the changes are coming, clearly we see increases in the prime
fixed and subprime fixed categories," said Mr. Brinkmann.

One concern is that although California, Florida and Nevada are leading the
foreclosure charts, the problem has spread to states like New York and its
metropolitan area, which has suffered huge job losses.

Also, across the nation servicers saw an increase in delinquencies among college
educated, prime loan borrowers who are losing their jobs, too.

If earlier delinquencies were caused by predatory lending and poor underwriting
- resulting in mortgages being made to consumers who should not have received
them - recent late payers have been hurt by a tremendously weak job market.

Meanwhile, the mortgage delinquency rate for borrowers 60 or more days past due
increased for the eighth straight quarter, reaching 4.58% in the fourth quarter,
a 53% increase from the same period a year ago, according to a new report from
TransUnion, Chicago.

In the third quarter the ratio, a national average, stood at 3.96%. Borrower
delinquency rates in the fourth quarter were highest in Florida (9.52%) and
Nevada (9.01%), while the lowest rates were found in North Dakota (1.21%),
Alaska (1.74%) and South Dakota (1.97%).

The three areas showing the greatest percentage growth in delinquency from the
previous quarter were Arizona (26.2%), Montana (24.5%) and South Dakota (23.9%).

Treasurer collects millions in back taxes;
642 properties sold for unpaid taxes; no bids for 1,225 more.

BYLINE: By NANCY J. SULOK, Tribune Staff Writer

SECTION: LOCAL; Pg. B1

SOUTH BEND -- Cha-ching!

The cash register was ringing Friday as tax sale purchasers showed up at the
county treasurer's office to pay for what they had bought the day before.

Treasurer Sean Coleman said the total amount collected is expected to be roughly
$8.7 million once all the money is tabulated.

The sales list started Thursday with 1,867 parcels where the taxes had been
unpaid for at least a year. Since the last tax sale was in 2001, some
delinquencies had been accumulating for multiple years.

Bidding started at the amount of delinquent taxes due on a property.

From the sales list, 642 parcels received bids, and tax liens were sold to the
highest bidder.

The amount of delinquent taxes collected amounted to almost $2.1 million. The
money is not considered a windfall for the county, Coleman said, because it
represents dollars that should have been collected already.

The surplus, or overbids, amounted to almost $6.6 million.

The surplus will be held in an investment account for a year in order to give
the original owner a chance to redeem the property, Coleman said. The nice thing
about it, he said, is that the money will be earning interest for the county
while it sits in the bank.

The delinquent tax list started out with 3,573 properties on it. Almost half of
them paid their taxes before the sale, representing another benefit for the
county.

The amount collected prior to the sale was around $5.6 million, Coleman said.

The expenses for the sale amounted to $66,630 for advertising, postage and
payment to Synergistic Resource Integration, the company hired to conduct the
sale.

The 1,225 properties that had no bidders will remain on the delinquent list and
could be offered for sale again next year if taxes remain unpaid.

If they don't sell after the second try, Coleman said, they will move to the
county commissioners, who have a couple of options for trying to dispose of
them.

Indiana's tax sale law will change after Jan. 1, Coleman said, and the procedure
for moving properties through the system will be speeded up.

BRIEF: Delinquent garbage bill could result in court date

BYLINE: Deangelo McDaniel, The Decatur Daily, Ala.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 254 words


Aug. 29--HARTSELLE -- If you are not paying your monthly solid waste bill, you
may receive a summons to appear in Hartselle municipal court.

"I don't want to summon anybody to court, but we can't keep sending
notifications," said Mayor Dwight Tankersley.

The City Council voted Tuesday night to clear up language making it a
misdemeanor for violating the solid waste ordinance.

Residents who fail to pay the mandatory $11.60-per-month fee are subject to a
fine of between $50 and $200 or incarceration of up to six months in jail.

Hartselle has been collecting its own garbage for about two years.

Tankersley said there are also 33 residents who are delinquent for $10 fees they
owe the city.

For $10 per haul, Hartselle offers a service that will pick up large limbs and
junk like used refrigerators. Homeowners call City Hall and the city picks up
the material before making people pay.

"This is convenient for our residents," Tankersley said. "I don't want to make
them pay in advance."

The council agreed to send residents on the delinquent list one more letter
before sending a police officer to summon them to court.

Delinquent Assessments Now Face Foreclosure By Sacramento Treasurer

                            April 21, 1992, Tuesday

By Debora Vrana

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES


Sacramento City Treasurer Thomas P. Friery said he will start foreclosure
proceedings today against delinquent assessments owed by property owners in a
1,473-acre assessment district.

Mr. Friery said he received more than $1 million in delinquent assessments from
several property owners last week, but 18% of the district's annual assessment
billing has not been paid.

Bonds secured by the assessments are not in default. But the delinquent
installment payments are used by Sacramento to pay debt service on $38.4 million
of limited obligation improvements bonds issued by the city in April 1989 for
the North Natomas Assessment District Number 88-03. The district includes the
ARCO sports arena.

Mr. Friery said payments were received from the Sacramento Sports Association,
Pacific Bell, and Centennial Mortgage Income Fund for the December and April
billings. If payments from Lukenbill Enterprises and Joseph and Nancy Benvenuti
are not received, Mr. Fiery said he will refer delinquent assessments to the law
firm of Sherman & Feller. The city would start proceedings only on those
property owners with delinquent payments, not the entire district.

Mr. Friery said the delinquent payments will not affect outstanding bonds
because the delinquencies are only a small percentage of the total assessment
collections.

The city will not initiate foreclosure proceedings against a $189,979 delinquent
payment from the Centennial Group, because the firm recently filed for
bankruptcy protection.

The installment payments represent assessments that property owners in a
district must pay twice a year. The collected assessments are placed in a fund
held by the city and used to pay principal and interest on the bonds.

Assessment payments in such districts are generally collected before scheduled
debt service payments, so a delinquency does not cause immediate problems for
bondholders.

Bargain basement prices at county tax sale: County recoups $228,000 in
delinquent property taxes

BYLINE: Ahmad Safi, St. Joseph News-Press, Mo.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 541 words


Aug. 26--On a $10 bid, Nathan Smith bought his first home in St. Joseph on
Monday -- a fixer-upper on South 12th Street.

The previous owner had not paid property taxes on the home for two years, and
Buchanan County sold the home for whatever price it could get.

Standing jubilantly outside the Buchanan County Courthouse, Mr. Smith said he
would soon begin renovation on the gutted three-bedroom home. He hoped to move
in with his fiancee and their seven children later this year.

Along with his $10 winning bid, Mr. Smith paid about $190 in surcharges to cover
fees the county incurred to advertise the property as delinquent.

"Two-hundred bucks for a house isn't bad," Mr. Smith said. "That's like
one-third a month's rent."

Shortly before 10 a.m. Monday, Buchanan County Collector Peggy Campbell carried
a sheaf of papers containing 371 delinquent properties into the lobby of the
courthouse.

Before her sat about 50 people -- real-estate investors, contractors,
businessmen, the curious -- all hoping for a steal at the county's annual
delinquent tax sale.

Over four hours, the county recouped $228,000 in back taxes by selling 139
properties.

On 115 of those sales, the county received all its back tax money.

The remaining properties were sold at a $10 minimum -- sales that weren't enough
to cover back taxes and now require the County Commission signature to abate
remaining taxes.

Ms. Campbell had the hardest time selling vacant lots. Homes went easier -- one
selling for $19,000 over what the county asked in tax money, between two dogged
bidders.

Two weeks ago, the county had 727 delinquent properties. But as auction day
approached, 50 percent were paid off by the owner -- the largest coming from
Star Land and Development Inc., which had owed $36,171 on 86 properties.

Still, the number of delinquent properties by auction time was up 9 percent this
year compared to the year before. Ms. Campbell attributes the rise to a flagging
economy, where homeowners and real-estate developers have let their taxes go
unpaid.

"It's the economy. People can't spread their money far enough," she said.

Still, the loss on Monday for some was a boon for others. Tom Ginn snagged his
second delinquent home.

His mother soon moves into the Midtown home he bought last year for $1,100. He
recently finalized the paperwork.

"I fixed that one up for my mother," Mr. Ginn said. "This year I'm buying for
myself."

On Monday, he paid $708 in cash on a two-bedroom house on Charles Street.

The house will be transferred to his name after 90 days if the homeowner doesn't
come forward to pay the taxes. Mr. Ginn said he lives near the home and believes
the owner is deceased.

"It's probably worth $8,000 to $10,000," Mr. Ginn said. " ... after remodeling,
I think it'll be on the low-end of $25,000."

New Worry for Tax Delinquents

BYLINE: By JEFF HOLTZ

SECTION: Section 14CN; Column 1; Connecticut Weekly Desk; Pg. 9

LENGTH: 489 words


FEBRUARY has been a bonanza for the tax collector in New Haven.

Armed with a fresh list of people who did not pay their motor vehicle taxes in
January, and a pair of radar gun-type devices that scan license plates, the city
has been seizing vehicles off the streets and from parking lots.

C.J. Cuticello, the city's tax collector, said about 250 vehicles had been towed
from Feb. 11 through last Wednesday morning. He said the stepped-up enforcement
was mostly in response to a January tax deadline. He said residents who had
bought vehicles after Oct. 1 were subject to supplemental taxes, and those were
due Jan. 31. Mr. Cuticello said close to 4,500 residents did not pay the taxes.

Mostly as a result of towing the vehicles, Mr. Cuticello said the city had
collected more than $100,000 from Monday through Wednesday morning.

''The lines at my office have been steadily out the door,'' he said. ''It's been
exceptionally unusual.''

Mr. Cuticello said the devices, called BootFinders, also scan for outstanding
parking tickets. He said the city had collected nearly $20,000 in parking fines
during the same period.

''We've found a direct correlation between delinquent taxes and delinquent
parking tickets,'' he said.

Mr. Cuticello said people must pay both before getting a release for their
vehicles.

Mayor John DeStefano Jr. of New Haven said he was pleased with the efforts to
collect the taxes and fines.

''The tax collector's job that I expect him to do is to act creatively and
aggressively,'' he said. ''And he sure has been doing that lately.''

Mr. Cuticello said each of his employees who was out with the BootFinder had
been accompanied by a state marshal and a tow truck operated by a private
contractor.

Mr. Cuticello said that last weekend's action included towing 10 vehicles from a
Wal-Mart parking lot.

''We hit a couple of lots, but 99.9 percent came off the streets,'' he said. ''A
parking lot is public space, and my warrant says I can seize the vehicle.''

However, Mr. DeStefano emphasized that the city would not make a habit out of
looking for delinquent taxes in private parking lots.

''Going on private property when people are going for their groceries is
something I don't want to turn into a routine method for collecting taxes,'' he
said. ''But I do think it's appropriate to make a point, particularly because I
expect to be going to my taxpayers this year and asking them for an increase in
the mill rate.''

Mr. Cuticello said only a few residents became extremely angry when their cars
were getting towed.

''Mostly people have run out of their houses and asked what are we doing,'' he
said. ''Then the marshal gives them the explanation.''

Mr. Cuticello would not say where and when his office would be out with the
BootFinders. ''We will go where there are vehicles,'' he said. ''And if we
suspect that there are tax delinquents and people who have been issued warrants,
we will look for their cars.''

California Labor Lawsuit Gets Former Employee $2.1 Million Award

LENGTH: 413  words


A former SDG&E employee who alleges he was fired for complaining about
discrimination against poor customers was awarded $2.1 million in his California
labor law lawsuit. The plaintiff alleged he was fired for being a whistleblower
against his company, in violation of federal and California labor laws, and
although SDG&E disagreed, a jury found in favor of the plaintiff.

According to CBS 8 News, the plaintiff, David Bryant, worked for SDG&E (San
Diego Gas & Electric) but was allegedly fired when he complained that the
company targeted low-income households to increase profits from late fees.
Specifically, Bryant alleged employees were told to hand-deliver delinquent
notices in highly dense, low-income areas of San Diego. Hand-delivered
delinquent notices can include a charge against the customer for $9 per note.

Bryant argued in the lawsuit that when he complained that the company was
targeting low-income customers, he was fired.

California Current (6/3/11) reports that Bryant had worked for SDG&E for 22
years, starting out in the billing department and working his way up to position
of senior collector by the time he was fired. Among Bryant's concerns were that
high-density, low-income areas were targeted because more delinquent notices
could be delivered in a shorter time.

SDG&E maintained that Bryant was fired for inappropriate conduct and violation
of company policy, but Bryant claimed he was fired in retaliation for speaking
out against SDG&E's practices.

In an interview with ABC 10 News (2/19/14), Bryant said that in one day in
January 2011, approximately 2,000 households were visited with delinquent
notices, earning more than $17,000. Of those, more than 80 percent were in
southeast San Diego, Bryant said. With SDG&E focusing on high-density,
low-income areas, higher-income households got a break, and were less likely to
have to pay the $9 hand-delivered delinquent note fee.

A jury agreed with Bryant and awarded him $1.3 million punitive damages and
$860,000 in compensatory damages. The jury found that SDG&E was liable for
wrongful termination and retaliation.

According to a media statement released by SDG&E (3/26/14), the company plans to
appeal the jury's decision. "We believe that the evidence presented at trial
showed that we reached the decision to terminate Mr. Bryant's employment after a
comprehensive investigation of allegations that he conducted himself at work in
a manner that violated company policies," the statement said.

Bigger projects now owe taxes

The tax debts keep mounting for Thomas Ranch developer Gran Paradiso.

The company is more than $9 million behind on its property taxes and assessments
and again tops an annual list of property owners that failed to pay their taxes
by the March 30 deadline.

That list, dominated by developers, underscores the fundamental changes the
Great Recession has wrought on the local economy.

Two years ago, a look at the top 100 delinquent taxpayers found properties with
an average value of $3.5 million. Today's troubled properties are much bigger,
with an average value of $12.5 million.

Countering that disturbing trend, perhaps, is that property owners in Sarasota
and Manatee counties were more prompt about paying their taxes this year than
last. In 2010 there are $86 million in delinquent taxes in the two counties,
well above normal, but significantly less than last year's record $102 million.

Most of that improvement was in Manatee County. While there was a slight
improvement in Sarasota County, the delinquent tax rate in Manatee fell 17
percent.

That probably should not be taken as a sign that the local economy is improving,
said Ray Williams, delinquents director for the Manatee County Tax Collector.
Last year, residents and businesses in foreclosure proceedings were late paying
their taxes, but this year the banks that now hold the properties are paying on
time, he said.

"We have seen a huge jump in bank payments on properties," Williams said.

Another factor driving down the delinquency rate is that local governments are
levying far fewer taxes than they were just two years ago. The dive in property
values has led to much lower assessments for most homes and businesses.

Taxes levied in the two counties in 2007 totalled $1.56 billion. But last year's
taxes, which were due March 30, were $1.32 billion.

Besides developers, the top of the list of delinquents includes the county's
school district and the state's water management district.

Usually, properties owned by governments are exempt from taxes, but North Port
has begun levying assessments against other local governments that own land
within its borders. The governments are refusing to pay and the issue will
likely be decided in court.

The dominance of large developments at the top of the list is a reflection of
the housing crisis, which had pummeled home prices and has now shifted to the
commercial market, said Sean Snaith, an economist at the University of Central
Florida.

"We still have a longer period of time before we get through the commercial side
of this crisis," Snaith said. "We're talking years probably more than quarters."

Vacancy rates for commercial buildings are high, and there is a lot of pressure
on owners to lower rents. Meanwhile, loans made by banks to commercial
developers are usually just five to seven years long and must be renegotiated or
refinanced when the loans come due.

Many of the troubled commercial properties will have a difficult time getting
new financing when their loans come due, because the lower rents they are
getting will make banks less willing to provide loans, Snaith said.

"That's the whole issue on how we can handle the resetting of these commercial
loans when property values are down 40 to 50 percent," Snaith said.

"Somebody's got to take a haircut in this, whether it's the banks or the
builders."

Foreclosure Starts, Housing Affordability Increase Nationwide in January: Black
Knight

BYLINE: Jacob Passy

SECTION: DISTRESSED Vol. 1 No. 1

LENGTH: 388  words


Despite an increase in housing affordability, both first-time and repeat
foreclosure starts reached 12-month highs in January, according to data released
Monday by Black Knight Financial Services.

Repeat foreclosure starts were up 11% from December and comprised 51% of all
starts, while first-time starts rose slightly by less than 1% to a yearly high,
Black Knight said in its latest Mortgage Monitor Report. Housing affordability,
meanwhile, also increased due to the continued low interest rate environment.

For foreclosures, a divide was seen between judicial and nonjudicial states. The
former saw January starts jump 10% from December, while nonjudicial states only
increased 1.7%. Judicial states also saw higher levels of new problem loans and
loans 90 or more days delinquent.

"At the same time, foreclosure sale counts - essentially, completed foreclosures
- have been decreasing more rapidly than the inventory of seriously delinquent
loans in both judicial and nonjudicial states," said Trey Barnes, Black Knight's
senior vice president of loan data products, in a press release accompanying the
report.

"As a result, foreclosure pipeline ratios, the backlog in months of foreclosure
and 90-day delinquent inventory based on current foreclosure sale rates, have
been increasing across the board."

In judicial states, the pipeline ratio was at 58 months, and nonjudicial states
are not too far behind at 53 months.

On a more positive note, Black Knight also reported a 1.41% decrease
month-to-month in the total U.S. loan delinquency rate, which now stands at
5.56%. Additionally, the five states with the highest percentage of noncurrent
loans were Mississippi, New Jersey, Louisiana, New York and Maine.

Housing affordability, measured as a ratio of fixed-rate mortgage payment on the
median home price to the median monthly household income, stood at 21% - well
above the low of 17.6% in October 2012 but still off the July 2006 high of
34.7%. The report added that home prices could increase 25% or interest rates
could jump 2% before affordability returned to its pre-recession levels.

In terms of the least affordable housing markets, Washington, D.C., Hawaii and
California came out on bottom having become less affordable than before the
housing bubble, while another seven states are on the cusp of a similar shift.

NC foreclosure inventory at 0.7%

BYLINE: Roberta Fuchs

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 378  words


The share of North Carolina homes with mortgages that were facing foreclosure in
April remained at 0.7 percent, the same as in March. The state's foreclosure
inventory stood at 0.8 percent in April 2015.

The Tar Heel State's foreclosure inventory was lower than the national rate of
1.1 percent of all homes with a mortgage in April, according to CoreLogic.

The company considers only mortgaged homes with first liens to determine its
foreclosure inventory data, which covers the number of homes placed in the
foreclosure process by the mortgage servicer.

In North Carolina, 2.6 percent of mortgages were 90 days or more past due, or
seriously delinquent, in April. That was down from 3.1 percent a year ago.

Nationally, 3 percent of homes with a mortgage were seriously delinquent in
April, a 22 percent drop from a year earlier. CoreLogic said the latest figures
represent the lowest serious delinquency rate since October 2007.

"The number of homeowners who have negative equity has fallen by two-thirds
since its 2010 peak, and the number of borrowers in foreclosure proceedings has
also continued to drop," said CoreLogic Chief Executive Anand Nallathambi in a
written statement.

However, he warned that 4 million U.S. homeowners still owe more on their homes
than what they are worth, and that these borrowers are more vulnerable to
foreclosure if they fall delinquent on their loans.

There were 15,639 completed foreclosures in North Carolina for the year ending
in April, down 20 percent from the 19,622 during the previous 12 months.

Nationally, completed foreclosures fell 19 percent in the same period.

States with the highest number of completed foreclosures in the year ending in
April were Florida, 66,000; Michigan, 47,000; Texas, 27,000; and Ohio and
California, each with 23,000. These five states accounted for 40 percent of all
completed foreclosures nationally.

The highest foreclosure inventory rate was found in New Jersey, with 3.7 percent
of homes with a mortgage facing foreclosure. New York had a 3.2 percent
inventory rate; followed by Hawaii, at 2.2 percent; Washington, D.C., at 2.1
percent; and Florida, at 2 percent.

Treasurer proposes tax payment plan

BYLINE: Bill Dolan, The Times, Munster, Ind.

SECTION: BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS

LENGTH: 349 words


Apr. 17--CROWN POINT -- The Lake County treasurer's office is preparing to make
it a little easier on property owners wanting to pay any delinquent taxes and a
little harder on those who refuse.

Treasurer John Petalas said Wednesday he expects to get state approval next
month for an extended payment plan for delinquent property tax payers.

"We still have to get the (Indiana Department of Local Government Finance)
approval, but hopefully by next month we can offer a plan to repay old taxes and
penalties over a six-month period without any new penalties added," Petalas
said.

He said he will be able to offer the same six-month terms to delinquent
taxpayers who now are being requested to pay up in three months.

"I want to help them out," Petalas said. "I know other counties are doing this."

However, delinquent taxpayers who don't get on a plan could see their property
auctioned out from under them this summer.

Petalas said his office plans to hold a tax sale as early as July 9 of more than
24,000 delinquent properties in Lake County. The owners of those properties owe
more than $58 million in back taxes and tens of millions of dollars more in late
fees, he said.

Petalas also looked forward to the next billing cycle, saying he doesn't know
what day the next round of tax bills will be mailed but has higher hopes this
year it will be earlier than Christmas.

County officials previously mailed tax bills in spring and fall installments
until the state overhauled its property tax assessment system, forcing hundreds
of taxpayers to line up in the closing weeks of the year outside the Lake County
treasurer's offices to pay final bills that didn't arrive until Christmas.

Sheriff's office contracts for tax collections

BYLINE: Patti Dozier, Thomasville Times-Enterprise, Ga.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 323 words


Feb. 17--THOMASVILLE -- After a year of collecting delinquent taxes, the Thomas
County Sheriff's office is contracting with a Snellville firm to collect the
money.

The sheriff's office has been collecting delinquent taxes since Jan. 1, 2009,
after Tax Commissioner Shirley Prevatt relinquished her ex-officio sheriff
status and told Thomas County commissioners she would no longer collect the
money.

The sheriff's office is contracting with Delinquent Tax Solutions Inc. (DTSI).

"It's very time-consuming for us," said Lt. Steven Jones, sheriff's office
operations officer.

The collections process ties up three or four sheriff's employees at a time in
the collection process -- from notifying the delinquent taxpayer about the
amount owed, including penalties and interest, to legal steps involved in
selling the property if the money is not paid.

"This company will do this for us," Jones explained.

"We're working on 2007 and 2008 delinquent taxes now ... We're running across
some as far back as 1999 we're trying to collect," the officer added.

Within two weeks, delinquent tax collections will be turned over to DTSI. The
company will bill delinquent taxpayers for as much as $175 for the collection
process -- in addition to taxes, penalties and interest.

"Only the person who is delinquent on the taxes will pay this company," Jones
said.

Contracting with DTSI will allow sheriff's office employees to tend to law
enforcement duties and save the agency the expense of overtime to collect the
taxes.

Charlotte-area foreclosure rate at 0.9 percent in Feb.

BYLINE: Roberta Fuchs

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 448  words


The share of Charlotte-area homes with a mortgage that were facing foreclosure
in February  remained at 0.9 percent of all homes, the same as in the previous
three months and down 0.4 percentage points from February 2014, according to
real estate data firm CoreLogic.

Statewide, 0.9 percent of homes with a mortgage were in the foreclosure process
in February, up slightly from 0.8 percent in January but 0.2 percentage points
lower than a year ago.

North Carolina's foreclosure rate was less than the nation's 1.4 percent rate in
February. Across the United States, only Massachusetts, Wyoming and Washington,
D.C., saw rises in their foreclosure inventory.

CoreLogic considers only mortgaged homes with first liens in determining its
foreclosure inventory data, which covers the number of homes placed in the
foreclosure process by the mortgage servicer.

Locally, the rate of Charlotte-Concord-Gastonia area mortgages that were 90 days
or more past due, or seriously delinquent, in February was 3.5 percent, the same
as in January. The region had a 4.4 percent serious delinquency rate in February
2014.

Nationally, 4 percent of homes were seriously delinquent in February, down from
4.9 percent a year ago. In North Carolina, that figure dropped to 3.4 percent
from 4 percent in February 2014.

"What's encouraging is that fewer Americans are seriously delinquent in paying
their mortgages, which in turn is reducing the foreclosure inventory across the
country as a whole," said Anand Nallathambi, chief executive of CoreLogic.

There were 5,091 completed foreclosures in the Charlotte metro area for the year
ending in February, down 35.5 percent from 7,892 during the previous 12 months.

Nationally, completed foreclosures for the year fell 16 percent to 550,322 in
February from 656,183 the previous year. In North Carolina, that figure fell
nearly 25.7 percent to 19,881 from 26,741.

Since the financial crisis peaked in September 2008, according to CoreLogic,
about 5.6 million homes nationwide have been lost to foreclosure.

The five states with the highest number of completed foreclosures for the 12
months ending in February were Florida with 110,000, Michigan with 50,000, Texas
with 34,000, California with 30,000, and Georgia with 28,000. These states
accounted for nearly half of all completed foreclosures nationally.

Four states and Washington, D.C., had the lowest number of completed
foreclosures for the year ending in February. They were South Dakota at 15;
Washington, D.C., at 83; North Dakota  at 334; West Virginia at 506; and Wyoming
at 526.

BRIEF: Seizure of personal property for delinquent taxes

BYLINE: The Orange Leader, Texas

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 182 words


Sept. 22--ORANGE -- Orange County Sheriff's deputies, in coordination with the
county's delinquent tax collection law firm, seized the business personal
property of an area business on Tuesday, September 20th.

Idleaire Inc., a Tennessee company that provides services to truckers at an area
truck stop, has failed to pay their local property taxes and have had their
local assets seized. The tax warrant allows for the taxing jurisdictions to
immediately seize and take possession of the personal property and to sell the
property if the delinquent taxes go unpaid.

Steve Bird, a partner in the Linebarger Goggan Blair & Sampson law firm,
explained that Texas law allows for the taxing entities to apply to the district
court for a warrant if there are unpaid taxes.

"The tax warrant process is a procedure that allows us to go to the place of
business and to immediately take possession of the property until the delinquent
taxes get paid," he said.

Calif. CRE Delinquencies Ease

SECTION: REAL ESTATE; Pg. 25

LENGTH: 403 words

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif.


According to the delinquency survey conducted by the California Mortgage Bankers
Association for the quarter ended Sept. 30, 94.7% of the commercial real estate
loans serviced by 30 California mortgage banking firms were either current or
only one payment delinquent.

Three months ago this figure was 93.4%.  It should be noted that 8.2% of the
delinquencies are due to properties damaged by the Northridge earthquake.  Were
it not for earthquake damaged properties, 95.1% of the loans would have been
current.

The 94.7% of loans reported current represents the highest percentage of current
loans since June 30, 1992, when the figure was 94.9%.

Furthermore, the most recently reported ratio of current loans represents the
greatest quarter-to-quarter improvement since the survey was started three and a
half years ago.

In terms of dollars, $ 1.3 billion (or 5.3%) of the $ 24.5 billion of loans
being serviced by the California mortgage bankers were two or more payments past
due.  Excluding the $ 357.5 million of loans in foreclosure, $ 951.6 million of
the loans were delinquent, as compared with $ 1,011.4 million as of June 30,
1994.  Loans delinquent due to the Jan. 17th earthquake totaled $ 106.9 million.

By number, 222 (or 2.5%) of the 8,747 loans included in the survey were two or
more payments past due.  Three months ago, 3.2% by numbers, were delinquent.  By
type of property, office buildings continue to show the highest delinquency
rate, accounting for 41.3% of the delinquencies.

Warehouse/industrial properties are in a distant second place, representing
16.6% of total delinquencies; next are retail properties representing 14.2%;
followed by apartment loans accounting for 13% of the total delinquencies.
Hotels/motels account for 5.2%, R&D buildings for 3%, and "other" types of
property for 6.7% of the percentage distribution of delinquencies by property
type.  Again, there were no delinquent mobile home park loans.

For survey purposes, a loan is considered delinquent if it is two or more
payments past due.  Loans in the process of foreclosure are included, regardless
of the number of payments past due.

Thirty income property mortgage bankers participated in the CMBA survey.  These
companies originate and service loans on apartments, retail, industrial and
other commercial properties for institutional investors such as life insurance
companies and pension funds.

Delinquency Rates on the Decline

BYLINE: By LISA PREVOST

SECTION: Section RE; Column 0; Real Estate Desk; MORTGAGES; Pg. 7

LENGTH: 593 words


As the economy improves, the number of borrowers who are seriously behind on
their mortgage payments continues to decline. The enhanced outlook is such that
even those in delinquency are feeling more optimistic about their circumstances
and homeownership in general.

The share of borrowers delinquent by 60 days or more is down in all 50 states
compared with a year ago, according to an analysis of 52 million mortgages by
TransUnion, a credit information service.

The national delinquency rate, 4.09 percent, is down from 5.33 percent at this
time last year, according to TransUnion. That is still well above the 1.5 to 2
percent delinquency rate that was the norm in the 1990s, before the housing
bubble. But it marks the seventh consecutive quarter of improvement, said Tim
Martin, TransUnion's group vice president for domestic housing.

The largest year-over-year declines were in California, Arizona and Nevada,
where rates fell 32 to 38 percent.

''They were some of the states that had the biggest run-ups,'' Mr. Martin said.
''They're seeing high percentage decreases because they got so high to begin
with.''

Although an expected rise in interest rates may hamper some delinquent
borrowers' ability to resolve their financial problems, delinquencies will most
likely continue to fall in coming months as the problematic older loans work
their way out of the system, he said.

Foreclosures are also down significantly nationwide. According to CoreLogic, a
residential property information provider, completed foreclosures in September,
at 51,000, numbered 39 percent fewer than in September 2012. The foreclosure
inventory, which includes all homes in some stage of foreclosure, was down 33
percent, to 902,000 from 1.4 million homes.

Access to refinancing continues to be a significant problem for delinquent
borrowers, according to the latest Fannie Mae National Housing Survey, a monthly
snapshot of 1,000 consumers. Almost 30 percent of the delinquent borrowers
surveyed said they had tried unsuccessfully to refinance in the last three
years. (These were borrowers who were 60 days or more behind, but not in
foreclosure.) Among those who said they had chosen not to refinance, the main
obstacles were an inability to qualify or to obtain affordable terms.

The extent of the loan barriers may be overstated, in that ''there's some
misperception among delinquent borrowers as to whether they can refinance,''
said Steve Deggendorf, Fannie Mae's director of strategic research. ''They're
not always aware of HAMP,'' he said, referring to the government's Home
Affordable Modification Program.

Still, these financial difficulties haven't soured delinquent borrowers on
homeownership. Some 67 percent agreed that a home purchase is a safe investment,
which represents an increase over the last three years, when only 53 to 57
percent felt that way. It appears that the enthusiasm generated by the improving
housing market and rise in home prices has trickled down to those struggling to
pay their mortgages, Mr. Deggendorf said. The rebounding numbers make sense, he
noted, given that previous Fannie Mae research has consistently shown lifestyle
preferences and emotional ties as holding more sway over homeownership than
financial concerns.

''Delinquent borrowers still have a very strong attachment to their home,'' Mr.
Deggendorf said, ''and I think a lot of them want to preserve their homes
because of all the lifestyle benefits they receive -- shelter, security, safety.
They've been through a bad time, yet they still have these ties to
homeownership.''

L.A. collects delinquent tax payments

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. A7

LENGTH: 251 words


Whacking away at the estimated $85 million owed Los Angeles, City Attorney
Carmen Trutanich announced Monday that his office has collected more than $2.5
million in delinquent business taxes since last July.

The city is prohibited from identifying delinquent taxpayers, but said the money
was collected from a wide variety of companies - from parking lot operators to
law firms, hospitals to construction companies.

"What's important about this, is that it is money that all goes into the General
Fund," said Chief Assistant City Attorney Bill Carter said.

Trutanich has made the collection of back taxes one of the top priorities of his
office. Since taking office in 2009, Trutanich estimates, his office has brought
in nearly $6 million owed the city.

The City Attorney's Office becomes involved after the Office of Finance is
unable to collect business taxes or special levies on parking lot operators,
telephone utilities and hotels.

With the ability to take legal action against the debtors, the City Attorney's
Office is often able to get the delinquent taxes paid.

There have been estimates the city is owed some

$200 million in back taxes and other fees, but Carter said he believes that
figure is inflated.

"We believe it is really in the $85 million to $100 million range," Carter said.

"A lot of the other (money owed) is from poor people who cannot pay an ambulance
bill or someone who wrote a check and it bounced. You can't realistically expect
to collect on those."

Investors delinquent on property taxes

BYLINE: Gayle Weber, The Hays Daily News, Kan.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 378 words


Sep. 11--Two investors in local properties owe more than $100,000 in back taxes
for the last two years.

Uniplace LLC, owned by Brooks Kellogg, owes more than $77,000 in delinquent
taxes for 2006 and 2007 for Stadium Place Apartments, which is a student housing
complex located near Fort Hays State University.

Hays Investors LLC, owned by Overland Park-based D.J. Christie, owes more than
$38,000 in back taxes for 2006 and the second half of 2007 for five lots in the
Home Depot Addition. Hays Investors also has delinquent taxes for the second
half of 2005.

Neither Kellogg nor Christie returned phone calls seeking comment.

Ellis County Treasurer Mickey Billinger said since the Home Depot lots are
vacant, the owners have two years to pay their taxes before the lots can be
considered for a tax sale.

"It's not an automatic sale," Billinger said. "The county commissioners have the
discretion to call for a tax sale when it's worthwhile to have a sale."

Billinger said the county usually doesn't call for a sale until there is enough
uncollected tax to make it cost efficient.

Since the Uniplace property is developed, owners have a three-year grace period
before the lot is eligible for sale.

Delinquent property owners were given several notices by the treasurer's office
before the list of delinquent property owners was published, Billinger said.
They also were given a grace period between the time of publication and the
deadline for tax sale on Sept. 2.

"Most of the people who let it go to that point have no intention of paying
their taxes," Billinger said. "The publication does not really motivate
delinquent taxpayers to bring up their taxes current."

Delinquent property owners are charged 11 percent interest on their back taxes
dating back to the Sept. 2 deadline.

There is $293,615 in delinquent 2007 taxes, as of this morning, according to
Billinger.

Knox County sees decline in delinquent taxes

BYLINE: Timothy Wyatt, The Times-Tribune, Corbin, Ky.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 298 words


Oct. 29--The Knox County Fiscal Court met Wednesday morning for their monthly
meeting, where it was revealed the number of delinquent taxes in the county has
seen a decline this year.

Knox County Attorney Gilbert Holland presented the court with a delinquent tax
collection report for October, which showed that citizens within the county paid
$123,202.59 in back taxes.

Taxes become late in January and if not paid by March, they go to the county
attorney for collection. If non-payment continues beyond the end of August, a
sale is held where outside companies come in to buy up the debt.

"When these companies buy those taxes, they can charge the individual a lot more
money, so luckily that's going down," said Holland.

One major factor that has helped county citizens make good on their taxes is a
payment plan that Holland is able to offer them once the debt gets to him.

"What we do to try to help people out with that is, once it comes to us, we
allow them to do a payment plan. They come into our office and setup a three
payment plan or whatever we can work out with them so that they can have it
paid," said Holland. "So, that's actually helped us increase our collection."

Holland noted there have been less debts available for companies to buy,
therefore people have been getting better at paying their taxes on time.

In other fiscal court business: -- The court unanimously approved two new hires
at the Knox County Detention Center. One was for a part-time deputy jailer/cook
position and the other for a part-time deputy jailer position. -- Two new
positions at 911 were also unanimously approved to add two part-time
dispatchers.

Delinquent property tax notices a warning

BYLINE: Michelle Charles, Stillwater NewsPress, Okla.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 348 words


Aug. 28--The Payne County Treasurer's Office has advertised its list of
delinquent property taxes in newspapers for the past two weeks as required by
state law. Now it's up to property owners to take care of their tax bills.

Payne County Deputy Treasurer Linda Matheson said most of the procedures
surrounding property taxes are set by state statute and the delinquency process
is actually designed to give people fair warning they have an outstanding
balance.

Properties with tax bills that go unpaid for four years are sold at the county's
delinquent tax resale auction each year on the second Monday in June.

"Our purpose is to get it paid," Matheson said. "We don't want to sell it and
we're not trying to embarrass people."

Not paying your property taxes can become an expensive proposition because the
balance increases by 1.5 percent of the base tax amount each month until it's
paid or the property goes to auction.

A delinquent tax bill is like a lien on the property.

Matheson said the County Treasurer's Office goes through many steps to insure as
many interested parties as possible, including mortgage companies and other lien
holders, are notified before the property goes to auction. People have the
opportunity to pay their tax balances right up until sale time but once they're
sold, that property has a new owner and there's no recourse.

The delinquencies that were just advertised are taxes that were due by December
2014.  Earlier balances aren't advertised but remain on the tax bill.

It would be hard for anyone to look at their tax statement and not know they owe
back taxes, Matheson said.

Those balances are noted on all tax statements with the code "BT" for back tax,
highlighted and printed in red ink so they jump out at the reader.

"We make it as clear as we can," she said. "We'll never make it clear enough for
everybody but we try to make it as clear as we can."

Calls regarding delinquent utility bills linked to scam

BYLINE: Melissa Erickson, Ames Tribune, Iowa

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 349 words


Oct. 06--Two Ames businesses have received calls from what city officials say
involved scams in which people were asking for money for delinquent utility
bills.

The businesses contacted the Ames Utilities office after receiving the calls on
Thursday and confirmed they were a scam, city spokeswoman Susan Gwiasda said.

"Both businesses thought it was suspicious and immediately made contact with our
utilities customer service to inquire if it was legitimate," Gwiasda said.

The city of Ames does not make phone calls for payment, Mike Wheelock, Utility
Accounts Supervisor said in a press release on Friday.

"Do not give these callers any information. This is a scam," Wheelock said.
"These businesses were not delinquent, and even if they were, the city of Ames
does not demand payment over the telephone."

The callers identified themselves as representing city of Ames utilities and
warned the businesses their utilities would be disconnected without immediate
payment, the press release said.

Gwiasda said a customer who is actually delinquent on their utility payments may
receive a call warning them of loss of service, but would not be asked for
payment over the phone.

"City staff would never ask for bank or credit card information," Gwiasda said.
"That's not how we operate. The city does not accept payment over the
telephone."

Gwiasda said that all payments to city utilities are run through a third party
payer, and customers must be the ones to initiate contact regarding payments.

These were the only two calls reported Thursday, although Gwiasda said it's
possible there were others that didn't call the city.

Ames police were notified as part of standard procedure, Gwiasda said, adding
that these scams "tend to be cyclical" and come up from time to time.

"Never give your credit card or bank information to someone over the phone that
you didn't call yourself," Gwiasda said. "We encourage people to hang up, call
us, ask if you are behind and what you need to do."

Tax amnesty yields $ 147,000 Second chance: The program has attracted thousands
of phone calls, and the state expects millions of dollars to come in before it
ends Dec. 5.

BYLINE: By Steve Harvey STAFF WRITERgeorgia; taxation; organizations

After enduring 10 days of print and broadcast ads featuring guillotines, sharks
and stern warnings from grim-faced announcers, Georgians forked over nearly $
150,000 in delinquent taxes under the state's tax amnesty program, revenue
officials said last week.

That's far short of the $ 30 million goal the state has set for the program, but
officials say they're not worried - even delinquent taxpayers, it seems, wait
until the last minute to file.

Under the tax amnesty program, the state will waive criminal prosecution and
fines for delinquent taxpayers who come forward to pay their taxes before Dec.
5.

Stiffer penalties ahead

After the deadline, Georgia residents caught evading tax payments will face
stiffer fines and penalties of up to $ 5,000 and three-year jail terms.

So far, more than 30,000 people have called a hotline to inquire about tax
amnesty, more than 20,000 of them during the first two days, said revenue
department spokesman Reg Lansberry.

The department's Rome regional office collected both the largest and smallest
payments during the first days of amnesty - $ 12,692 in delinquent withholding
taxes from a business and $ 11.55 from an individual taxpayer. The Tucker office
reported the largest total collected at more than $ 24,500.

Callers have ranged from one taxpayer who wanted to file returns for the past 20
years to a prisoner in Reidsville who called the Tucker office thinking the
state was offering general amnesty for any and all past transgressions.

The program applies to individuals and businesses who failed to file returns or
pay taxes before the 1991 filing deadline.

Last-minute surge expected

But while state officials say they are encouraged by the public response, they
still have a ways to go.

The state hopes to collect $ 30 million in back taxes by the December deadline,
or about 10 percent of the estimated $ 300 million in known delinquent taxes.

The $ 147,000 collected to date represents a minute fraction of the $ 30 million
goal and only about 15 percent of the $ 950,000 the state will spend in
advertising to promote tax amnesty.

State officials say they expected the tax payments to start slowly and gain
momentum toward the deadline.

"If you look at the experiences of other states, most of the money comes in
during the last two or three weeks" of the program, said Ann Meyers, an account
executive with Siddal, Matus & Coughter Inc., the Richmond, Va., ad firm hired
to promote Georgia's amnesty program. "That's because people procrastinate. They
wait until the last minute to pay."

During income tax season, she said, "usually the refund filers are the first to
file, and people who owe are the last to pay."

Publicity push to continue

Ms. Meyers was a spokeswomen for Virginia's taxation department in 1990, when
the state conducted a similar amnesty program that generated $ 32.2 million, or
about 20 percent more than expected.

"In the second week of the Virginia program, we had reached about the same
watermark as Georgia," she said.

Mr. Lansberry said revenue officials will work to maintain public awareness in
the coming weeks as taxpayers become distracted by elections and holiday
shopping.

"We want to keep working the various media markets to get exposure," he said.
We'll be talking to tax preparers, Lions Clubs, Rotaries. We don't want
awareness to wear down."

To apply for tax amnesty, persons or businesses can call 656-4674 in metro
Atlanta, or toll free (800) 347-4674.

County approves sale of delinquent tax properties

BYLINE: Gary Nelson, Crossville Chronicle, Tenn.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 384 words


Nov. 02--CROSSVILLE -- The Cumberland County Commission accepted a
recommendation from the Delinquent Tax Committee and approved the sale of 17
parcels of property (building lots) on Renegade Mountain.

The lots, which were owned by the county after property taxes were not paid,
were sold in order to get them back on the property tax roll. The Delinquent Tax
Committee met prior to the October county commission meeting and approved the
action. The property was sold for a total offer of $2,550 for all 17 lots to
Raymond Salyer. The Resolution, 10-2011-12, the sale of 17 parcels of property
on Renegade Mountain, was approved unanimously after a motion was made by Nancy
Hyder, 2nd District commissioner. Hyder's motion was supported by Dave Hassler,
3rd District commissioner.

"It isn't a lot of money, but at least they are going to be back on the tax
roll," Hyder said.

The county commission also made a few appointments during its October monthly
meeting.

Commissioners approved Resolution 10-2011-3 -- a resolution to appoint John
Kinnunen to fill a vacancy on the Crossville Cumberland County Convention and
Visitor's Bureau for a term to expire June 30, 2013. The appointment was
approved unanimously after a motion was made by 9th District Commissioner Clyde
Cramer and was supported by 8th District Commissioner Sonya Rimmer.

Commissioners also approved Resolution 10-2011-4 -- a resolution to appoint
Clark West to fill a vacancy on the Industrial Development Corporation Board of
Cumberland County-Crossville for a term to expire April 30, 2013. It was
approved unanimously after a motion was made by 3rd District Commissioner Johnny
Presley. The motion was supported by Terry Carter, 6th District commissioner.

In other areas, the county approved Resolution 10-2011-11 a resolution
authorizing the sale of a 1994 GMC truck that is no longer utilized by
Cumberland County government. It was approved in a 17-0 vote after a motion was
made by Carter. Carter's motion was supported by Cramer. Mike Harvel, 7th
District commissioner and employee of the county's solid waste and sanitation
department, abstained from the vote.

Norwalk could take over Dog Island, other properties

BYLINE: Robert Koch, The Hour, Norwalk, Conn.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 434 words


July 19--NORWALK -- The city could become the new owner of a small,
often-submerged island in Long Island Sound.

For lack of other bidders, Dog Island, a rocky outcropping between Shea and
Sheffield islands, went to the city in Norwalk's 2016 tax sale at Norwalk
Concert Hall on Monday night.

"It's been the city's practice to purchase unimproved property -- to hold for
open space or for potential other uses -- for the taxes due," Norwalk Director
of Finance Robert O. Barron said afterward. "We're doing the same this year."

The owner of the 0.4-acre island, which the Norwalk Tax Assessor's Office has
valued at $70,990, has six months to redeem the property or else it will go to
the city.

Dog Island was among 16 Norwalk properties that went to the auction block Monday
as part of the tax sale. The Norwalk Tax Collector's Office periodically holds
the sales to get delinquent taxpayers to square up.

When the office began preparing for the sale last November, 169 properties were
slated for inclusion. Criteria for inclusion were $17,000 or more past due,
regardless of the length or time, or property three or more years in arrears,
regardless of the amount.

By Monday, most had paid up and the city had collected more than $3.6 million in
delinquent taxes.

Two delinquent taxpayers squared up with the office Monday and a third attempted
but failed.

"We came here today to pay the taxes and you told us 'No' and then the financial
director said 'Yes,'" said Kevin Johnson, New England States/Eastern Canada
president of the Improved Benevolent Protective Order of Elks of the World,
speaking to tax collector Lisa Biagiarelli.

Representatives of the organization arrived at the tax sale shortly before 5
p.m. with a $26,000 check to pay taxes owed for the property at 92 Lexington
Ave.

Biagiarelli said her office in November first notified delinquent taxpayers of
the tax sale. The office closed early Monday to set up for the sale, which began
at 3 p.m. with bidder registration in the auditorium.

"Our office today closed a 2 o'clock and even after that we were looking for
you," Biagiarelli said. "It's not fair to the other 149 people who were able to
follow the rules."

Johnson said Biagiarelli's staff could have accepted his organization's check in
the auditorium as easily as it accepted bid down payments for the tax sale.

Since 2003, the Tax Collector's Office has held seven tax sales, collecting more
than $27 million in delinquent property taxes, Biagiarelli said.

CONDO ASSOCIATIONS FACING DELINQUENCIES AIDED BY RULING

BYLINE: By KIMBERLY MILLER Palm Beach Post Staff Writer

SECTION: LOCAL; Pg. 9C

LENGTH: 682 words


Nearly 70 percent of the owners at the Kensington of Royal Palm Beach
condominiums are delinquent on their association fees.

At the Paradise Cove at Palm Beach Lakes, 48 percent of owners owe back dues.

And at Cypress Estates of Palm Springs, 56 percent of units are in arrears.

The three communities share the same story. Investors bought heavily during the
boom, but now sit on units worth half what they paid.

In some cases, owners are renting their units, waiting for a foreclosure or
short sale, and although collecting monthly tenant checks, refuse to pay the
association fees that fund insurance, water, cable, maintenance and landscaping.
There's been little recourse for those paying their fees and trying to maintain
a livable community.

But a recent court decision may change that.

This month, a Palm Beach County Circuit Court judge preliminarily awarded a
blanket receivership to the Palm Beach Grande Condominium Association, which has
about 50 percent of its owners delinquent on fees.

The decision will allow an independent company to collect rents directly from
tenants living in Palm Beach Grande condos, bypassing the unit owners.

While a judge must still rule on a final order detailing how the rent will be
collected, the preliminary decision is a boon for Palm Beach Grande and myriad
other associations straining to provide services.

Kensington, Paradise Cove and Cypress Estates have all since followed Palm Beach
Grande's lead, filing petitions for blanket receiverships.

"There's anger. The owners who live here are disheartened because they work hard
and care about the community," said Karen Cicciari, Kensington of Royal Palm
Beach association president. "It's a nightmare."

Until recently, requesting a blanket receivership to collect delinquent
association fees was an unusual move.

Past practice has been for an association to ask for a receiver for each
individual unit in default. But that was when defaults were relatively few.

Now, faced with hundreds of delinquent units, blanket receiverships are becoming
more common.

Recent court decisions in Miami-Dade and Broward counties have granted blanket
receiverships, allowing a court-appointed representative to directly collect
rents to pay off fees.

"In Dade, this was touted that it would save everybody," said Mark Quinn,
president of Banyan Property Management, which oversees Palm Beach Grande. "It's
not going to save these people, it's just another tool that will allow us to get
more revenue."

Palm Beach Grande units were going for $165,000 to $180,000 during the real
estate boom. Their current market value, as listed by the Palm Beach County
Property Appraiser's Office, is about $50,000.

The two-bedroom, two-bathroom units at the Kensington of Royal Palm Beach sold
for upwards of $340,000 between 2006 and 2008. Now, many of them are worth half
of what owners paid.

Cicciari said her condo fees are about $320 a month. The association chose to
drain its reserve this year to pay for services instead of raising monthly dues.
Cicciari said the association feared losing more paying owners if fees went up.

"We're providing cable to the whole community, but there are only a handful of
us paying," Cicciari said. "It's becoming out of control."

The real problem, Quinn said, is when major repairs are needed, but there's no
rainy day fund.

"If we had a hurricane, communities like this, with no cash cushion, I don't
know how they would ever pay their insurance policy deductible, or clean up," he
said. "If the receivership doesn't work, what happens to these communities, no
one can really answer that."

Kwame Building Group of St. Louis, program management; Teng & Associates Inc. of
St. Louis, main terminal and concourse architectural designs; Kozeny-Wagner Inc.
of St. Louis, arriving baggage claim design and build; Apple Designs Inc. of
Raleigh, N.C., entrance monuments and signage design; and Burns and McDonnell's
St. Louis office, mechanical, electrical, plumbing and special systems
renovations design for main terminal and concourses.

Restoration work on the airport's domed ceilings is expected to start in next
month and renovation of the inbound baggage system is expected to start early
next year.

Airport property listed at $3.8 million

FESTUS - A real estate firm has listed the Festus Memorial Airport property for
$3.8 million.

In May, the City Council selected St. Louis-based CB Richard Ellis to market the
61-acre airport property, along with 35 other acres that include an inactive
landfill and a flood plain. The property has been appraised at $2.2 million.

Citizens for Airport Economic Expansion lobbied to keep the airport open and
have been operating the airport for several years.

Members of the local pilots group helped pay for a feasibility study that showed
expansion would be viable. But Festus city officials did not want to incur
additional costs, and any federal funds provided for an expansion would need to
be routed through a government entity.

Sewer bills would be delinquent sooner

ALTON - The City Council has approved a resolution that would change when sewer
bills become delinquent. Effective Aug. 1, bills not paid after 21 days will be
considered delinquent, and a late fee will be tacked on. Currently, bills are
not considered delinquent until after 30 days.

Also, sewer bills will be grouped with fees for trash collection and water usage
and will be on monthly bills mailed out by Illinois-American Water.

In April, trash bills increased $4 per household, to $10. Some calls from
residents have questioned the fee increase, but city officials said the
complaints have been few. Officials said $10 is significantly lower than what
residents of other municipalities such as Roxana and East Alton pay.

The sewer bill resolution will be represented at the next council meeting in two
weeks in the form of an ordinance and is expected to be approved.

Record property value forfeited to St. Louis County in 2013

BYLINE: John Myers, Duluth News Tribune

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 1450 words


Dec. 09--William Kaper Jr. walked into the St. Louis County courthouse in Duluth
last Monday, his 76th birthday, and wrote a check for $63,972.11.

And just like that, Kaper, who had been St. Louis County's largest delinquent
property owner, was up to date on his back taxes.

County officials say Kaper rescued 35 parcels outright by paying up all current
and delinquent taxes and fees. He also delayed forfeiture on another six parcels
until 2015. And he made partial payments and set up payment plans on 192 other
parcels, to be paid back over five or 10 years. He'll pay 10 percent interest
each year.

"He's all good with us now," said Brandon Larson, who heads property tax records
for the County Auditor's office.

The News Tribune in July featured Kaper as the largest of hundreds of property
owners who were years behind in paying their taxes. These aren't people who
missed a payment or two -- these are properties on which taxes haven't been paid
for at least five years for commercial property, six years for homesteads.

Many, like Kaper, paid up or established payment plans by the Dec. 1 deadline.

But the owners of 291 parcels across the county, valued at a record $8 million,
did not pay up, and the state now owns those properties -- including homes,
vacant lots and large commercial buildings.

That's double last year's $4 million in property forfeited to the county and $2
million more than any other year on record.

"It's the most I've ever seen. We've had some years with more parcels forfeited,
but never anywhere near this kind of value," Larson said.

All told, the forfeited property means $678,000 in property taxes won't be paid,
money that will have to be made up elsewhere, said Don Dicklich, St. Louis
County Auditor.

This year's forfeited list includes 77 homes, Larson said, and a commercial
building on Hibbing's main street that's more than $86,000 delinquent. The
building, which was the Hong Kong Super Buffet before it closed, is valued at
$282,100.

More taxes left unpaid

Heading into this week's deadline Kaper held the distinction of having the most
parcels with unpaid taxes in St. Louis County -- 225 -- and the third-highest
amount of taxes owed; nearly $170,000, including this year's taxes. Only two
bankrupt companies owe more.

But Kaper was far from alone. The legal notice posted by the county in June
listed 919 parcels, owned by hundreds of people, as required by state law under
what's called a Notice of Expiration of Redemption. It was the longest
delinquency list in years -- up from 775 parcels last year and nearly double
that of 2010.

County officials say it reflects the economic downturn that hit in 2007, with
more people unable, or unwilling, to pay their taxes on time. But they also said
there's no clear pattern on why so much higher-valued property was forfeited
this year.

This year's 919 delinquent properties, with 291 parcels forfeited, compare's to
775 delinquent and 246 forfeited in 2012.

The biggest jump was for single-family homes and commercial buildings. The
number of single-family homes forfeited jumped from 46 in 2012 to 77 this year,
while the value of those homes jumped from $1.4 million to $3.1 million.

The number of commercial buildings forfeited jumped from 13 in 2012 to 21 this
year and the value jumped from $650,000 to $2.2 million.

State law requires five years of nonpayment of taxes before the county starts
the delinquency process in the sixth year. In addition to the notices published
in newspapers in June, sheriff's deputies in July hand-delivered notices to
people who live on the delinquent property, another step required by state
statute. If no one lived there, a notice was pasted to the doorway.

If those people didn't respond or pay, their property was forfeited as of Dec.
1.

Recession hit hard

The list of new forfeitures includes a half-million dollar commercial property
at 1820 Maple Grove Road in Duluth, just across Highway 53 from the Miller Hill
Mall. That 10,600 square-foot building, owned by Duluth Realtor Ken Truscott,
has $59,512 in unpaid taxes.

Truscott purchased the former Schneiderman's furniture store in 2004 when real
estate prices for commercial property were skyrocketing. But then the recession
hit, tanking the real estate market as well as the value of his building,
Truscott said.

Since then Truscott has tried to keep up. But as cash flow problems worsened "we
got to the point where the only option was to not pay the taxes for a time,"
Truscott said, noting taxes on the building are now $22,000 per year.

In 2011, Truscott paid off $40,000 in back taxes. But when he tried to set up
payment plan, like Kaper did for his parcels, he found out state law at the time
didn't allow it for buildings valued over $500,000. Truscott's building is
valued at $553,000.

"There was no way under the law we could set up a workout (payment) plan until
after it goes to forfeiture, so that's what we're doing," Truscott said. "We'll
go in after the first of the year and set up a plan where we can pay 10 percent
down and pay the balance off over 10 years."

State lawmakers just this year changed that law, Larson noted, and going
forward, county auditors will have the discretion to allow delinquency payment
plans for higher-valued commercial buildings.

The building remains for sale, Truscott noted (it's listed at $850,000) and he
hopes the rising economy and attractive location will ultimately lead to a sale.

Truscott also said he's working to convince state lawmakers to change the
current 10 percent interest charged on unpaid balances each year, noting it's
nearly double current interest rates charged by commercial lenders.

"It hasn't been changed in decades," he said. "It's way out of line."

System is patient for payments

As Truscott's plan highlights, the state's forfeiture laws are set up to give
the owner multiple chances to pay back taxes and penalties before the property
can be sold at auction to the public. That right to re-purchase lasts a year for
bare land and commercial properties and never expires for a homestead.

The county Lands and Minerals Department will send out eviction notices in May,
which amounts to the seventh year of nonpayment for homes, said Karen Zeisler of
the St. Louis County Lands and Minerals Department. That notice, with the word
"eviction" on it, often spurs payment.

Even after forfeiture and eviction notices, though, state law allows people to
put 10 percent down of what they owe and start a payment plan, although at that
point, the state holds the deed to the property until all the taxes are paid.

"They essentially buy it back on a contract for deed by paying all the taxes,
penalties and interest," Zeisler said.

If the owner makes no effort to pay, the earliest any of the recently forfeited
parcels would be auctioned would be autumn of 2014.

The system's long grace period, which amounts to five, six or even seven years,
allows property owners like Kaper and Truscott to use the county as a sort of
safety valve when finances aren't good. They can still pay their mortgages and
utility bills on the property, but hold off on taxes if the money isn't there.

Kaper is a millionaire and real estate speculator who lives on a 7-acre estate
in Barrington Hills, Ill. In July, he told the News Tribune he owns millions of
dollars' worth of property in multiple states.

But when his cash flow dipped during the Great Recession and he found himself
holding properties worth less than what he paid, with no prospective buyers,
Kaper said he opted not to pay some of his property taxes on time.

Kaper, like many others, knows the property tax system, dictated by state law,
bends over backwards to keep people in their homes and owning their property.
Because it takes years for the property to actually forfeit, property owners
know they can go for long periods without paying taxes.

While some people have expressed anger that Kaper and others are abusing the
system and taking advantage of other taxpayers, Kaper said the system has worked
well.

He praised the efforts by county Auditor's staff to set up his payment plan --
both their math skills and courtesy.

"After your story ran (in July) I had many people, actually several dozen phone
calls from people who I call bottom feeders wanting to buy my land for almost
nothing," Kaper said. "I was at a vulnerable time and they were trying to take
advantage of me. ... But the system works. And I want everybody in my situation
to know they don't have to deal with those bottom feeders. The county has a
system where you can keep your property."

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Back to Top

The Railroad Retirement Board (Board) proposes to amend part 367 of the Board's
regulations, Recovery of Debts Owed to the United States Government by
Administrative Offset. Specifically, the Board proposes to amend § 367.3(a),
Board Responsibilities. Section 367.3(a) states that all nontax debts over 180
days delinquent shall be referred to the Department of the Treasury for
administrative offset through the Treasury Offset Program as required by 31
U.S.C. 3716. 31 U.S.C. 3716 was amended by the Digital Accountability and
Transparency Act (DATA Act), Public Law 113-101. The DATA Act now requires
agencies to refer to the Department of the Treasury valid, delinquent nontax
debts for the purpose of administrative offset at 120 days. The proposed
amendment to § 367.3(a) of the Board's regulation would change from 180 days to
120 days the debts referred to the Department of the Treasury in compliance with
the DATA Act.

The Board, with the concurrence of the Office of Management and Budget, has
determined that this is not a significant regulatory action under Executive
Order 12866, as amended. Therefore, no regulatory impact analysis is required.
There are no changes to the information collections associated with Part 367.

O'Brien pays county $17,855 owed in delinquent taxes

BYLINE: Michael P. Buffer, The Citizens' Voice, Wilkes-Barre, Pa.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 328 words


Jun. 24--WILKES-BARRE -- Luzerne County Recorder of Deeds James "Red" O'Brien
paid off a delinquent tax bill of $17,855 and sold O'Brien's Irish Pub and
Restaurant last week for $205,000, records show.

County officials last month could not explain or justify why the tax claim
office didn't auction off O'Brien's property earlier or why O'Brien still owed
taxes from 2005 and earlier. The county tax claim office typically auctions off
properties when delinquent taxes date back at least two years, and last fall's
upset sale involved properties with unpaid taxes from 2005 and earlier.

O'Brien, a Democrat who won his county office in November, said last month he
would pay his back taxes when a pending sale of his Avoca bar was finalized and
the state approved a liquor license transfer.

Michael J. Crawford and Stephen M. Bartush bought the property at 635 Main St.
for $205,000 on June 18, according to the deed.

Sam Diaz, the former county chief of budget and finance, was in charge of the
tax claim office until he stopped working for the county in March, and Diaz
claimed he instituted a get-tough approach with delinquent taxpayers when he
began overseeing the tax claim office in 2006.

O'Brien's annual salary with the county is $36,562. Last year, O'Brien finished
serving a term on the Pittston Area School Board.

According to tax claim records, O'Brien owed $10,813 from unpaid school taxes
and fees, $1,154 from unpaid municipal taxes and fees, and $5,887 from unpaid
county taxes and fees.

Another local credit union rescued

BYLINE: By George Avalos Staff Writer

SECTION: MY TOWN; Contra Costa; News; Local; Business

LENGTH: 596 words


OAKLAND -- A big credit union from the Midwest is negotiating to merge with
Kaiperm Federal Credit Union, which has become the latest such financial
institution in the East Bay to struggle with red ink.

Chicago-based Alliant Credit Union and Oakland-based Kaiperm Federal are
pursuing a merger of the two finance services firms, according to Alliant and a
letter that Kaiperm issued. Kaiperm is not directly linked to Kaiser Permanente.
However, the 15,000-member Kaiperm Federal company does cater to Kaiser health
plan members, Kaiser Permanent employees and the Oakland chapter of the NAACP.

"After extensive research and review to determine how best to improve and
enhance the financial lives of our members, our board has decided to pursue a
merger with the Alliant Credit Union," Shirley Jones, Kaiperm's chairman, stated
in a message to the company's members. Kaiperm

Alliant executives also were enthusiastic about the pending merger, which could
be complete by September.

"We are excited about this opportunity," said Joe McGowean, Alliant's director
of marketing. "We think it's an excellent fit for all parties involved."

The deal is a reminder that the implosion of the housing market still menaces
the balance sheets of financial companies. Like other East Bay credit unions,
Kaiperm has been losing money and has been forced to cope with delinquent loans.

Kaiperm's decision to combine with Alliant came on the heels of a money-losing
first quarter of 2008 and four quarters of losses during 2007.

Over the first three months of this year, Kaiperm lost $2.2 million. That was on
top of a loss of $3.8 million for all of 2007.

Financial losses have jolted at least two other East Bay credit unions,
Concord-based Cal State 9 and Pleasanton-based Sterlent Credit Union.

In both those instances, a much larger financial company, Patelco Credit Union,
stepped in to provide financial support to its smaller cousins.

Patelco and Cal State 9 in mid-May disclosed a proposal to combine the assets of
the two credit unions. The deal effectively enables Patelco to acquire Cal State
9. In late May, Patelco and Sterlent announced an agreement whereby Patelco
would financially stabilize and assist Sterlent. But the precise nature of this
financial assistance was murky.

The common thread in all of these cases: Cal State 9, Sterlent, and Kaiperm have
been losing money. All three were burdened by delinquent real estate loans.

Kaiperm reported that at the end of March, it had $2.6 million in real estate
loans that were delinquent for more than a month. That was an increase from
Kaiperm's December 2007 total of $2 million in realty loans delinquent for more
than a month.

Alliant at the end of March had $5.33 billion in assets. During 2007, Alliant
posted a $19 million profit. Kaiperm's assets at the end of March totaled $96
million.

"We have been discussing this with Kaiperm for about three months," said Rudy
Pereira, an Alliant senior vice president. "We took a look at Cal State 9, but
they didn't fit our business model. While we were looking at Cal State 9, we
heard that Kaiperm was looking for a merger partner."

Despite the financial setbacks at the three East Bay credit unions, the
regulators and the companies have been careful to protect members. That's the
case with the Kaiperm deal, Kaiperm and Alliant executives said.

"It is business as usual," Jones said. "Rest assured your funds are safe and
secure."

Tax delinquency under dispute in fire claim

BYLINE: Michigan Lawyers Weekly Staff

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 536  words


The plaintiff claimed damages in excess of $250,000 for fire-related damage to a
home and its contents. Following investigation, defendant Nationwide Property &
Casualty Insurance Co. denied the claim. The plaintiff filed suit and after
initial discovery Nationwide filed a motion for summary judgment based on a
misrepresentation in the application regarding whether the taxes were delinquent
on the property for two or more years.

The policy was obtained through an oral application followed by a written
application. The plaintiff had answered that the property taxes were not
delinquent two or more years and admitted in an examination under oath that she
was aware that the property taxes had been delinquent for two or more years at
the time of the application.

Defendant argued in its motion for summary judgment that this was a material
misrepresentation and that MCL 500.2103(2)(j) provides that a person is not
"eligible" for home insurance whose real property taxes are delinquent two or
more years at the time of the application.

Plaintiff filed a response brief, arguing that the taxes were not delinquent for
two or more years as calculated pursuant to the Michigan General Property Tax
Act, MCL 211.78(a)(2). Defendant argued in response that the Michigan General
Property Tax Act had nothing to do with the interpretation of the policy of
insurance; that the taxes were delinquent per the Wayne County Treasurer; and
that under well-settled Michigan insurance law, the court must apply the
commonly used meaning of the language of the policy and to avoid strained and
technical constructions.

The court issued a 12-page written opinion granting Nationwide summary judgment,
holding that the Michigan General Tax Act had no relevance to the case; that the
plaintiff had answered the application question that the property taxes were not
delinquent by two or more years; that the tax-collecting entity, Wayne County
Treasurer, defined "delinquent" as taxes that were not paid; and that Michigan
law requires that courts enforce contract language in accordance with its plain
and commonly used meaning.

The court held that the taxes were delinquent for two or more years using the
common and ordinary meaning of the phrase; that there was a material
misrepresentation; and that the policy was thus properly rescinded.

Michael F. Schmidt, co-counsel for defendant, provided case information.

City still owed $1.7 million in delinquent service fees

BYLINE: JUSTIN D. ANDERSON

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. P1D

LENGTH: 466 words


DAILY MAIL STAFF

A year after a letter campaign to get Charleston residents and landlords to pay
up on delinquent fire and refuse fees, about $1.7 million remains to be
collected, city officials said.

The effort to collect started last year about this time when city officials
decided it was time to start collecting from deadbeat city residents and
landlords who were more than 90 days delinquent on the fees.

City officials sent letters to every one of them.

By the first of this year, the city discovered it had recouped a modest $300,000
of the $2 million in fees owed.

That still leaves about $1.7 million delinquent, give or take a few settled
accounts here and there and commitments to square the bills on payment plans,
said city Finance Director Joe Estep.

Estep said he considers the mass-mailing method a somewhat successful tactic,
and the city is thinking about another round. But there are other options
available.

"There are still some issues we're looking to pursue, perhaps through legal
action," Estep said. "We just haven't made that move yet."

Estep warned last year that deadbeats might find themselves in magistrate court
if they didn't settle their accounts. But the city has decided to continue with
the letters and keep court as a last resort.

"If there's a message to be had here, it's that simply because we haven't done
it to this point, I wouldn't particularly get complacent," Estep said.

"Hopefully, the readers will keep that in mind."

Of the 2,746 letters the city sent out, 255 were returned to sender. Those
letters that came back undeliverable accounted for about $200,000 in fees.

A year ago, the city even had a list of the top 10 delinquent accounts. Estep
said most of those were cleared up after the letters were sent.

The city's focus has turned internal, Estep said. Most of its energy these days
is spent going through Kanawha County Courthouse records trying to figure out
why those 255 letters came back to them and where those folks are now.

"If people don't get the bills, obviously we're not getting paid," Estep said.

A special employee also will be hired to do nothing but collect these particular
fees, Estep said. The new employee could be on board by next month.

The city is entertaining another round of the mass-mailings like last year,
Estep said. The letters certainly would be cheaper than going to court for
hundreds of civil cases.

The ideal would be for people to just get honest and fork over the fees. But
Estep is realistic. Charleston government is a business just like any other
business, he said.

"I would never expect to get it all," Estep said. "I think what we've got to get
to is the place where we know what we're dealing with, a real uncollectible
issue, then write it off."

PhillyDeals: Offering a break to delinquent taxpayers

BYLINE: By Joseph N. DiStefano; Inquirer Staff Writer

SECTION: BUSINESS; P-com Biz; Pg. C03

LENGTH: 653 words


There's nothing like hard times to bring out the soft side of the taxman. Or of
the cash-starved state and local government.

Gov. Rendell Monday opened Pennsylvania's first tax amnesty since 1996.

That year, the commonwealth brought in $93 million, according to Auditor General
Jack Wagner. This year, the state and its contractors are trying to collect a
bigger chunk of the more than $2 billion that the Department of Revenue says
your neighbors owe.

Taxpayers who were officially state-tax delinquent as of last June 30 can avoid
penalties, and run up only half the usual interest charges, by owning up and
paying out. More at www.pataxpayup.com. The amnesty runs through June 18.

Separately, Philadelphia "will waive all penalties and half the interest due on
eligible delinquent tax bills" in its own amnesty, the first since 1986, under a
bill passed by City Council last year.

As city Revenue Commissioner David Richardson had warned, tax amnesties can make
people feel entitled to paying late.

Still, as Wagner noted, New Jersey and other states have raised millions by
declaring amnesties, instead of spending scarce recession dollars on tax
enforcement against citizens and businesses.

That's welcome news to Richard Leonard, of Northeast Philadelphia, who recently
started working for the U.S Census Bureau following a period of unemployment
when he lost his store job. "I did that Philly thing where you pay the utility
bills to keep the heat on, but fell behind" $1,600 on his real estate taxes, he
told me.

Leonard pledged to make good during the amnesty: "We try to stay honest,
tax-paying citizens."

The city amnesty starts May 3 and runs to June 25. City contractors have set up
a phone line for the program, 877-645-4108, running from 8 a.m.-9 p.m. weekdays
(only until 6 p.m. Fridays), also Saturdays from 10 to 2.

The Web site, www.phillytaxamnesty.com, went online last week. "On May 3 you
will be able to log on and start the application process, but you can send a
post-dated check right now, if you really want to," said program manager Marisa
Waxman.

There's even a walk-in center, at 1315 Walnut St., Suite 1300, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.,
weekdays. But the city would just as soon you stayed home and dialed your money
in: "It's easier if you go online, or by phone," says Waxman.

Moving downtown? Harleysville's fine, but First Niagara Group may want to move
its local headquarters closer to Philadelphia. It's scouting new locations, says
Robert Kane, the ex-PNC Bank executive tapped by First Niagara business-lending
chief Daniel E. Cantara 3d to run the former Harleysville National Bank, which
First Niagara bought last year.

"We need to be in Center City," going after the most "dynamic" part of the local
business market - and may also move the regional headquarters "closer to
Philadelphia," Kane said. First Niagara Bank is headquartered in Buffalo.

First Niagara took over after Harleysville ran low on capital following its
purchase of the former Willow Financial Bank.

First Niagara says it has plenty of capital, having picked up a net $3 billion
in new deposits from the former National City Bank in western Pennsylvania, and
raised another $1 billion by selling shares in 2008-09. With all that new money,
"we want to lend it out," Cantara told me.

The new owner has fired administrative, financial, and other workers from the
former Harleysville Bank; it's also hired a handful of new business lenders, and
will be hiring more, Cantara said.

New name "Customers 1st Bank" is the new name for the former New Century Bank,
the ailing Phoenixville-

based lender taken over and recapitalized (with $67 million in investors' money)
by ex-Sovereign Bancorp boss Jay S. Sidhu last year.

Sidhu says he'll open four new offices spread across Bucks and Berks Counties
and Mercer County, N.J., this year. The bank will hire up to 20 new staff.

California firms paying bills faster than their neighbors

LENGTH: 174 words


California businesses are much better at paying their bills on time than their
counterparts in any surrounding state, according to Experian, Costa Mesa-based
information services giant.

On average during March, California firms were 5.25 days past due while Nevada
businesses were 12.06 days delinquent; New Mexico, 11.53 days; Arizona, 11.1
days; Utah, 10.24 days; Colorado, 10.6 days; Oregon, 8.26 days; and Washington
8.2 days. Overall, the Experian's Business Benchmark Report shows businesses are
doing much better at reducing their financial risk and paying their bills on
time.

The report is a monthly look at how businesses are faring. It looks at four key
indicators of business health: commercial risk score, days beyond payment terms,
percentage of dollars delinquent and percentage of dollars severely delinquent.

Also, California, Texas and Arizona were among areas with the lowest percentage
of dollars that were delinquent, with an average of 9.27 percent, 10.14 percent
and 9.6 percent, respectively.

Pena gets BISD delinquent tax collection contract

Jun. 25--By a 6-1 vote, the Brownsville Independent School District Board of
Trustees on Tuesday renewed the contract of Enrique Pena and Associates of
Brownsville to collect the district's delinquent taxes.

Pena and Associates was in the second year of a two-year contract as the
district's delinquent tax-collection firm. Its fee is 12 1/2  percent of the tax
liability to the district. For example, if a taxpayer owes $100, Pena is allowed
to collect $112.50.

A committee of four members of BISD's finance department had ranked Pena last
among four firms that had sought the contract. In order from first to third were
Linebarger, Goggan, Blair and Sampson, L.L.P.; McCreary, Veselka Bragg & Allen,
P.C., and Perdue, Brandon, Fielder, Collins & Mott, L.L.P.

However, Interim Superintendent Brett Springston said he had reviewed the
criteria for rating the firms and ranked Perdue and Pena on a par, followed by
Linebarger and McCreary. If forced to separate his two top picks, he said he
would put Perdue on top.

According to a tape of the meeting, Trustee Dr. Enrique Escobedo pointed out
that board members have wide discretion in awarding such contracts

Board member Joe Colunga moved to award the contract to Pena and Associates and
Minerva Pena (no relation) seconded the motion.

Colunga, Pena and Escobedo voted for the motion along with Trustees Rolando
Aguilar, Ruben Cortez Jr. and Rick Zayas. Trustee Catalina Presas-Garcia opposed
the motion.

She questioned Springston's review of the bidding criteria as well as Pena and
Associates' record of collections.

Interim Finance Administrator Robert Ruiz said Wednesday that all four of the
firms are well qualified, that the district could work with any of them and has
worked well with Pena and Associates.

State targets jobless tax scofflaws.

HIGHLIGHT: unemployment compensation taxes


Mar. 3--Didn't pay your unemployment taxes? Indiana is coming after you.

State officials said Thursday they have launched a series of lawsuits against
delinquent companies to help replenish the fund that pays unemployment benefits
to out-of-work Hoosiers.

The Indiana attorney general's office filed suits in Marion County against three
businesses the state claims are delinquent by hundreds of thousands of dollars
in unemployment compensation taxes.

More suits will follow, the agency said, as it tries to collect a total of $57
million owed by about 17,000 businesses.

The suits were filed Monday against:

Sprigler Concrete Construction and Edward Sprigler, of Floyds Knobs, for
$216,519

Triangle Concrete Contractors, of Muncie, for $305,846

Miken Industries, doing business as Everdry Waterproofing, of Fort Wayne, for
$178,238.

The companies were targeted because they had the largest outstanding balances,
state officials said Thursday. None of the three companies could be reached for
comment.

In effect, companies that pay the taxes are unfairly subsidizing others who
aren't, said Ron Stiver, commissioner of the Indiana Department of Workforce
Development. He said the state is taking steps to recoup the money and replenish
the fund.

"We're getting more money into the fund," Stiver said.

Last fall, the state collected more than $225 million after offering amnesty on
delinquent state taxes.

Approximately 10 percent of employers are delinquent at a given time, Stiver
said.

So great was the demand for benefits -- as more workers collected funds after
being thrown out of work by a slow economy and outsourcing -- that the pool of
money shrank. The fund, called the Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund, had a $1.5
billion surplus in 2001, but by 2005 the surplus had dwindled to $618 million.

That happened even as tax collections for the fund swelled during the period to
$569 million from $259 million. In effect, the money was being sucked out of the
fund faster than it could be filled up.

As a result, the state in 2006 raised unemployment compensation taxes by
one-third, to the highest level allowable, to keep the fund solvent, Stiver
said.

He said the agency has stepped up tax collections since Gov. Mitch Daniels took
office in January 2005.

The state's tax collectors will begin collection proceedings against companies
within 180 days of falling delinquent. Before, the state waited a year or more.

Despite the state's new aggressive posture in collecting taxes, Stiver said the
agency realistically expects to collect only about $10 million of the $57
million owed.

E-470 tolls increasing Jan. 1 Also, officials revise the way penalties are
assessed on delinquent accounts.

BYLINE: Jeffrey Leib The Denver Post

SECTION: DENVER & THE WEST; Pg. B-01

LENGTH: 495 words


E-470's board of directors on Thursday approved toll increases for Jan. 1 and
amended the highway's policy on assessing penalties and fees on drivers with
delinquent accounts.

Officials of the toll road also said they will work with the Colorado Department
of Revenue on a plan to put a hold on an E-470 user's vehicle-registration
renewal until past-due tolls, fees and penalties are paid on a delinquent
account.

The law allows such a hold to be put on vehicle-registration renewal in cases of
delinquent toll bills, but E-470 has not sought authority to do so until now,
said John McCuskey, the toll road's executive director.

As part of the new toll schedule for Jan. 1, directors hiked the toll at four of
the highway's mainline toll plazas by a dime to $2.50 for its transponder
holders.

The Plaza A toll, at the south end of the highway, also will jump by 10 cents to
$2.25 for transponder users. About 75 percent of E-470 users have transponders.

Ramp tolls will go up by a nickel for them.

The one-fourth of E-470 drivers who are tolled by a read of their license plates
also will pay higher tolls next year that again will include a premium payment
over the transponder rate.

A year ago, E-470's board voted to impose smaller annual toll increases instead
of the previous policy of hiking mainline tolls by 25 cents every three years.

The highway board, composed of public officials from the east metro area, also
voted to change the way E-470 bills those with delinquent toll accounts. The new
policy will charge road users $25 for each civil penalty notice instead of $25
for every toll transaction contained in that notice.

Before the change, a toll account in the civil penalty phase that had 10 toll
transactions totaling $25 in tolls due also would have been assessed $25 per
transaction, or $250, in addition to the tolls, late fees and collection fees
due.

Under the new policy, E-470 users in such a case could settle the account by
paying the tolls and fees due and one $25 civil penalty fee instead of the $250
in accumulated per-transaction penalties, said Joe Donahue, E-470's finance
chief.

E-470 officials urged customers with delinquent accounts to call the road's
customer-service line, 303-537-3470, to take advantage of the policy change.

The highway has issued about 200,000 civil penalty notices to delinquent road
users since May, Donahue said. Each notice typically averages about 10 toll
transactions.

The board's policy change also calls for the assessment of a single $20 court
fee per court appearance if a hearing officer issues a final order of liability
on a disputed toll bill, instead of hitting the road user with a $20 court fee
per toll transaction.

Overdue toll bills get to a hearing officer about seven months after use of the
highway, if earlier payment-notice deadlines are not met.

``Our primary goal is to encourage people to pay our tolls,'' McCuskey said of
the policy to end the accrual of per-transaction penalties and court fees.

Virginia, Maryland Give Late Taxpayers a Break

BYLINE: Nancy Trejos; Washington Post Staff Writer

SECTION: FINANCIAL; Pg. G01

LENGTH: 550 words


If you owe back taxes to Virginia or Maryland, you have some time to redeem
yourself.

Both states are offering amnesty to delinquent taxpayers for a limited time.
Maryland residents have until Oct. 30 to settle their tax bills. Virginia
residents have until Dec. 5.

With state revenue battered in the economic downturn, officials are seeking cash
to bolster their reserves.

"Like all states, we need the revenue, and this is money owed to the
Commonwealth of Virginia anyway," said Joel Davison, a spokesman for Virginia's
Department of Taxation. "And why not give people a break during these
recessionary times?"

Both states will waive all penalties and half of any unpaid interest unless the
penalties are related to fraud. Annual interest has averaged about 8 percent in
Virginia over the past five years. The interest rate on unpaid taxes in Maryland
has been 13 percent annually. In Virginia, taxpayers pay penalties of 6 percent
a month after the first month of delinquency but no more than 30 percent of the
total tax bill in penalties. A 10 percent penalty is assessed on delinquent tax
bills in Maryland each year.

Maryland's program, which began Sept. 1, applies to liabilities on returns due
on or before Dec. 31, 2008. Any taxpayer who took advantage of a 2001 amnesty is
not eligible for the same tax covered under that previous program. In Virginia,
you must have a delinquent bill that was assessed on or before July 9, 2009.
Even those who took advantage of previous tax amnesties in 1990 or 2003 qualify.

Virginia's program, which began Oct. 7, differs in other ways. Those who choose
not to participate in the program will have to pay a 20 percent penalty on any
outstanding taxes. No such penalty will be assessed on delinquent taxpayers in
Maryland.

Also, those who seek amnesty in Virginia must pay what they owe within the 60
days that the program is underway. Maryland residents can set up payment plans
that expire Dec. 31, 2010.

"Virginia's program is a carrot and stick," said Burton J. Haynes, a tax lawyer
based in Burke, Va., who practices in both states and has had many clients seek
the amnesty.

"They offer you a carrot if you settle. They'll waive the penalties. The stick
is if you don't settle anything in the amnesty, they will impose a 20 percent
penalty."

Virginia's Taxation Department notified 550,000 people and businesses that they
qualify. The average tax bill is $2,315, and the state hopes to generate $48
million for its general fund. There are no figures available on how many people
and businesses have applied for amnesty, but the number of calls to the
department has increased dramatically, Davison said.

In Maryland, 172,568 people and 32,316 businesses are eligible. The state has
received 2,248 applications, of which 222 were denied for various reasons, such
as fraud, said Lisa Lester, a spokeswoman for the Comptroller of Maryland's
office.

The state hopes to generate $5 million in revenue. As of last week, it had made
$4.1 million.

The District's city council recently approved a tax amnesty program but has not
yet designated dates for it.

People seeking more information on Maryland's program can call 1-800-MD-TAXES or

Stopping scofflaws of child support;
The Burlington County Sheriff's Department will start using the "boot" on cars
of delinquent parents.

BYLINE: Angela Valdez INQUIRER SUBURBAN STAFF

SECTION: NEIGHBORS BURLINGTON; Pg. BR01

LENGTH: 339 words


The Burlington County Sheriff's Department has launched an initiative aimed at
reeling in delinquent child-support payments: the boot.

Starting Oct. 29, parents in arrears for whom arrest warrants have been issued
could find their cars and trucks immobilized.

During a state-sponsored amnesty period, beginning tomorrow and ending Saturday,
delinquent parents can avoid being arrested or having their cars booted by
reporting to court on their own. Family Court will have extended hours.

The Sheriff's Department has only four boots. The device locks over a vehicle's
wheel and onto the hubcap, making the vehicle impossible to drive.

The department will initially target parents who are the most behind in their
payments.

However, acting Sheriff Jean Stanfield said, no one is out of bounds.

If a sheriff's officer happens upon the vehicle of a parent for whom there is a
warrant, the officer can boot the car if the arrest can't be made.

Stanfield said the program is essentially a way to get parents into court.

At any given time in Burlington County, she said, there are about 1,400 open
warrants for the arrest of parents who have not paid child support. The
department arrested about 1,290 delinquent parents last year.

The department has yet to decide whether to buy more boots.

"We're going to wait and see how successful it is and how long the turnaround
time is," Stanfield said.

The department decided to begin using the boot after hearing of a similar
program that has been successful in Cape May County for a couple of years,
Stanfield said.

The department has not opted for the tactic favored in Virginia, where
delinquent parents' cars are immobilized with distinctive pink and powder blue
boots.

Stanfield said her department has struggled to find ways to reduce the number of
delinquent parents.

"Why don't people take responsibility for their children?" she said. "That's a
big question. I don't have an answer for it."

Michigan Says Yes To Letting Cities Sell Tax-Lien Issues

                          October 28, 1998, Wednesday
                              Correction Appended

DATELINE: CHICAGO



Detroit can now craft its first-ever bond issue backed with delinquent property
tax collections.

A Michigan bill signed last week by Gov. John Engler allows municipalities to
either sell tax liens in bulk to a private tax collector, or to sell securities
backed with potential collections.

Detroit officials said more research is needed before they'll know for sure
whether they want to try a tax-lien issue. But the city has already named
PaineWebber Inc. and Lehman Brothers as senior managers for such a deal, with
PaineWebber running the books. Robert W. Baird & Co., the city's longtime
financial adviser, would be adviser on the deal.

Detroit City Council members could decide as early as today whether to hire two
so-called servicing companies to begin sizing up how much the city is owed in
uncollected taxes, said finance director Valerie Johnson. The firms, J.E. Robert
and Liata, are based in New York City.

Tax-lien securitizations, the technical term for the transactions, have gained
in popularity in recent years. States and cities that have allowed backlogs of
uncollected taxes to build up calculate that they can hunt down enough of the
money to make it worthwhile for investors to advance them some of the cash.

That means the municipalities will have to go beyond sending out late notices.
"A lot of city governments, state governments are not strong on collecting
seriously delinquent receivables," noted one municipal bond industry member who
has worked on past tax-lien deals.

Johnson said the city is owed somewhere around $100 million in delinquent taxes.
Of course, some liens will be judged uncollectable, said Shiv Rao, Moody's
Investors Service assistant vice president and analyst. An issuer has to size
its deal accordingly to reassure credit agencies and the market.

Detroit hasn't determined how it would spend bond proceeds from a tax- lien
securitization, though some officials would like to use the money for one-time
capital projects.

"We certainly have committed to not using proceeds for operating, recurring
expenses," she said.

Detroit would be the first Midwest government to sell such bonds, though New
York City, Philadelphia, the District of Columbia, and a couple of New Jersey
cities have completed tax-lien bond sales in the past five years.

The transactions are far from a sure thing in the eyes of the market. "They're
really so new," said Richard Ciccarone, co-head of municipal investments for Van
Kampen American Capital Investment Advisory Corp. "You have to be a little
skeptical. It's very possible we would look for higher (yields)" to compensate
for the perceived risk in such transactions.

If Detroit's City Council approves the contract, the servicers first would
review the city's internal processes for foreclosures and collecting delinquent
taxes. Second, the servicers would conduct due diligence on the delinquent
tax-lien portfolio, including how up-to-date property valuations are and how
many properties are affected by bankruptcy proceedings, which can prevent
collections. Third, the firms would determine whether to proceed with a
securitization and present a plan - include deal structure and fees - to the
council.

Johnson said she wants a fee structure that would create incentives to servicers
to aggressively pursue those liens that are tougher to collect.

Overall, the path to selling bonds will take at least several months, Johnson
and others close to the deal predicted.

Tax-lien deals stand on their own merits, said several industry members familiar
with these type of transactions. Other tax-lien deals typically have not carried
bond insurance or had a second revenue stream for bond payments, in case
collections falter.

Rating agencies scrutinize the accuracy of property tax valuations and
governments' abilities to foreclose quickly, which depend upon local foreclosure
laws. Rapid foreclosure means less yield needs to be paid to bondholders, Rao
said.

Bad-loanbullbull;
Robert Lee buys sour mortgages, and these days there are a lot to choose from.
His latest venture: a Web site detailing properties in foreclosure in O.C. and
eventually nationwide.

BYLINE: By MATHEW PADILLA; The Orange County Register

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. Cover_D

LENGTH: 1222 words


it's after 6 a.m., and Robert Lee has been at his Huntington Beach office about
an hour when he gets a phone call telling him one of his home-loan borrowers
filed for bankruptcy and then lied about it.

Lee jerks in his chair and then bolts up as he is told a homeowner in Buffalo,
N.Y., filed for bankruptcy in April but gave the court a false address for the
loan servicer, which never received court documents and so was unaware of the
bankruptcy.

"He's trying to strip the mortgage," Lee says, theorizing the borrower will pay
an appraiser to value the property for less than the $49,000 owed and have the
difference classified as unsecured debt by the bankruptcy court, making it hard
to collect.

The news comes after Lee spent weeks negotiating with the borrower -- Lee
thought -- to avoid bankruptcy and settle the debt.

"I'm going to foreclosure on him today," Lee tells the caller.

Lee, 42, whose full name is Robert E. Lee Jr., has spent the past four years
buying loans from lenders when borrowers don't pay. When a loan goes delinquent,
banks can either sell to an investor like Lee, try to work with a struggling
borrower or foreclose.

He has an ownership stake in about 1,000 loans and heads two companies,Horizon
Trust DeedsandForeclosure Trackers, with about 16 employees and independent
contractors working on the third floor of a high-rise on Beach Boulevard.

Lee said he's one of the smaller buyers of delinquent loans, but experts say the
market is fluid, with hedge funds and other investors jumping in and out all the
time and no one accurately counting total loans traded.

Yet one large broker of loan sales says the market, somewhere in the billions of
dollars, is growing as home prices fall across the country and banks juggle
rising defaults. A number of lenders have shut down or filed for bankruptcy,
putting their loans on the auction block.

That fattening pie is luring some big firms. Bond giantPimcois launching a $2
billion fund to invest in distressed debt, though it declined to discuss the
details. And in August,TCW Group, a Los Angeles-based money manager, closed a
similar $1.56 billion fund to new investors.

Kingsley Greenland, chief executive of Boston-basedDebtX, an online broker of
loan sales, said amid softening home prices, delinquent first mortgages are
selling in the range of 50 cents to 60 cents on the dollar against unpaid
principal balance.

But each case is different, and prices could be higher or lower depending on
several factors, he said. For example, a delinquent subprime loan might sell in
the range of 40 cents on the dollar, he said.

Greenland said loan buyers like Lee are good for borrowers. Because investors
buy loans at a discount, they're more willing to work with a borrower on a
repayment plan, he said. That's an opposite perspective from lenders who see the
loan as a loss, he said.

"One is how good can I make this, and the other is how bad is it going to be,"
Greenland said.

Lee profits by buying loans at a discount and getting borrowers to start paying
again even if he has to cut them a deal. If they can't pay, he'll offer them
money to go away without filing for bankruptcy or foreclosure so he can quickly
resell.

If he must, he'll foreclose, and he may still make money, but he also could
break even or even take a loss as home prices slide, Lee said.

Lee said he's getting access to bigger loan pools by wedging his way into the
doors of more lenders. He and his co-workers dial banks nonstop each day.

At 5:15 a.m., he's the first to arrive at work each day. "I can't wait to wake
up in the morning," he says. He doesn't quit until 7:30 p.m. And he works
weekends. With little time for play, he's gained 30 pounds in the past few
months.

On a recent day in his office, Lee bid over the phone on several loan packages.
Lee says he has to see as many deals as possible because he won't budge on his
pricing and so gets outbid fairly often. He declined to say what he pays for
loans.

In one call, a woman with a bank in Indiana tells him she has faith that an
investor who outbid Lee will come through. "I guess I'm an eternal optimist,"
she says.

Lee counters by saying he will have his money on reserve on the day the Indiana
deal is set to close in case the original buyer waffles.

His next call is toNortheastern Capitalin New York. Lee got caught in traffic
from a massive auto accident and didn't have a chance to review some loans the
company is selling.

"I'll bid by the end of the day," Lee says.

He makes other calls, sometimes alone, sometimes with investment partners. He
advises colleagues John Coonis and Rob Boyko what to bid on loans after looking
at each deal for about a minute. Lee says he doesn't pass on individual loans
because a bank might be "testing him" and offer him bigger deals if he performs.

Coonis shows him a photo of a home in Vancouver, Wash., that appears recently
built and well-kept.

"Ninety-nine percent are beautiful homes, newer ones," Lee says, looking at the
photo. "These are not crack houses."

He never wants to foreclose after he buys a loan, Lee says, because home prices
are falling and he could lose money.

But he and his investors approach each deal as if they will have to foreclose
and sell the property as an REO, a real estate-owned or "bank-owned" home,
because struggling homeowners in a soft housing market usually don't have the
equity to pay to refinance and can't find a buyer for their property.

Even if he is willing to lower someone's payment or forgive some debt, in many
cases they still can't afford the loan, he said.

The credit crunch has made things even worse, he said.

"Nobody can get a loan in America," Lee said.

In some markets, REOs are adding up, depressing prices, he said. "We're in an
REO war," Lee says.

Lee reviews plenty of loans in Orange County.

For example, he recently reviewed a $253 million pool of loans fromWashington
Mutual. The pool of more than 1,000 loans stretches across the U.S. but includes
some familiar cities: Aliso Viejo, Anaheim (four properties, the most among
local cities), Dana Point, Irvine, Laguna Niguel, Laguna Woods, Mission Viejo
and Santa Ana.

He's also recently reviewed multimillion-dollar loan pools
fromIndyMac,WachoviaandWells Fargo.

And Lee's had his share of flops.

He bought a second mortgage on a home when the first mortgage, which he didn't
own, was being serviced byOption One Mortgage Corp.in Irvine. Lee said the
borrower wanted to make up missed payments on the first, but Option One, perhaps
as a result of recent layoffs, never responded to calls from him or the
borrower. Eventually, the company foreclosed on the first mortgage, and Lee got
nothing for the second.

Now he only buys a second mortgage if payments on the first are current.

Lee said he is "very nervous" about buying loans when he has no idea how far
prices will fall.

At the same time, his world, the flip side of the market, will thrive as the
housing boom continues to unravel.

"It took five years to create this monster. It will take another five years to
work it out," he said.

Tentative settlement reached in tax case

BYLINE: By Don Spatz

LENGTH: 486 words



The agency used by Reading and 16 other municipalities and school districts to
collect delinquent property taxes has reached a tentative settlement in a
class-action suit in Philadelphia County Court involving 14,000 late payers,
including 260 from Reading.

The plaintiffs claim that Portnoff Law Associates of Wynnewood, Montgomery
County, tried to collect attorneys' fees when the law didn't allow it, and that
the fees and interest it charged on delinquent accounts were excessive.

In addition to the firm, defendants are Dawn M. Schmidt, the Philadelphia-based
Portnoff attorney who signs most of the billing notices, and Michelle R.
Portnoff, a company attorney.

The case covers only those notices Portnoff sent from November 2000 to November
2002, when the case was filed.

However, Schmidt said Thursday that an August 2003 law retroactively allows
attorneys' fees to be charged in tax-lien cases and that Portnoff's fees and
interest rates are allowed by law.

"But it's easier to pay than fight," she said.

Schmidt said she was unfamiliar with the full terms of the settlement.

David A. Searles, a Philadelphia attorney representing the plaintiffs, declined
to comment until Judge Mark Bernstein approves the settlement. The judge has not
set a date for that hearing.

Searles represents Allentown resident Beverly Roethlein, one of several
delinquent taxpayers billed by Portnoff.

The suit was declared a class-action suit to include Portnoff's debt collection
services for 17 municipalities and school districts in Pennsylvania.

Portnoff has been collecting delinquent Reading property taxes since May 2002.
The company filed 664 judgments in Berks County Court in 2003, 488 in 2004 and
287 so far this year.

City officials could not be reached for comment.

Portnoff has settled two earlier federal suits over its collection practices.

The most recent case was settled in September for $ 250,000 and involved
Portnoff's collection of unpaid trash bills from various municipalities in the
state. There were 3,800 accounts in dispute in that case.

Also, a case was settled two years ago for $ 150,000 involving Portnoff's
collection of delinquent water and sewer bills in Bethlehem, Northampton County.
There were 1,654 accounts in dispute.

Plaintiffs in both cases claimed Portnoff charged excessive fees and violated
federal debt collection laws.

They alleged Portnoff did not identify itself as a debt collector, nor gave
debtors the required notice that they had a right to a 30-day dispute period.

Delinquent tax sale nets county $78,000

BYLINE: Keith Lawrence, Messenger-Inquirer, Owensboro, Ky.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 245 words


Aug. 09--Investors paid $78,405 last week for 143 delinquent tax bills during
Daviess County's annual tax sale.

Denise Campbell, supervisor in the recording section of the county clerk's
office, said that was about the same as last year's figures.

But it was down from 2012 when 138 delinquent bills were sold for $113,957.

Each summer, the county sells tax bills that have not been paid to private
investors who can charge up to 12 percent interest a year on the debt.

In some cases, the investor can even sell the property in a foreclosure sale.

Campbell said 36 of this year's delinquent bills were on property that had their
tax bills sold last year as well.

In those cases, the companies that bought the 2013 bills also bought this
year's, she said.

"We had quite a few people come in to pay before the sale" on Aug. 1, Campbell
said.

Tax bills that didn't sell at the auction can still be bought by investors, she
said.

Those bills that never sell continue to accrue 12 percent interest each year
until the property is sold, Campbell said.

Then the county collects its back taxes plus interest.

But Campbell said when property goes into foreclosure, "we don't get the full
amount that's owed."

This year's delinquent bills ranged from $28.32 to $10,382.

MBA: Mortgage Delinquencies on the Rise

SECTION: MORTGAGE BANKING; Pg. 8

LENGTH: 430 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON


Mortgage delinquency rates are on the rise but not enough yet to cause a great
deal of concern among the nation's mortgage bankers.

Delinquencies on all mortgages -- which includes loans that are 30, 60, and 90
days late -- climbed to 4.99% for the quarter ending December, a slight increase
from the last quarter of 1988 when delinquencies climbed to 4.85%.

Delinquencies on Veterans Administration and Federal Housing Administration
loans rose to 6.56% and 6.99% respectively in the fourth quarter, a slight
increase from last year's results.

According to a recent survey conducted by the Mortgage Bankers Association,
delinquencies in the 30-day category have risen more sharply than in the 60-day
and 90-day category.

Loans that are 30 days delinquent rose to 3.47% from 3.20% a year ago.  The most
rapid increase came in the third quarter when 30-day delinquencies jumped from
3.04% to 3.45%.

"We're not up in arms about it yet because most of the increases in
delinquencies have appeared in the 30-day category," said Tom Holloway, senior
economist for the MBA.

"When the numbers start rising in the 60-day and 90-day categories then we'll
know we have something more substantial," he said.

Loans that are 90 days or more delinquent dropped to 0.76% in the fourth
quarter, from 0.90% a year ago.

Loans that are 60 or more days delinquent rose slightly to 0.76%, from 0.75% a
year ago.

The MBA believes that the increase in loans that are 30 days late can be
attributed to servicing transfer problems.

"Following a transfer it is not uncommon for a borrower to send a payment to the
previous servicer and thereby, become delinquent with the current servicer," the
trade group said in its report on delinquencies.

"The mix-up is typically corrected quickly, preventing the delinquency from
becoming more serious," the report notes.

"This type of problem could account for the rise in overall delinquency rates
and would likely remain confined to the 30-day category."

Despite real estate problems in New England, the Northeast still had one of the
lowest delinquency rates in the country.

Broken down regionally loans originated in the Southeast Central part of the
country -- including Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas -- had a
delinquency ratio of 7.86% at the end of December, the highest in the country.

Loans originated in New England and West Coast states enjoyed the lowest
delinquencies, with ratios of 3.65% and 3.75%.

Southeast Central loans had a 7.27% delinquency rate.  Loans originated in
Mid-Atlantic states had a 5.24% ratio.

Elon reviews delinquent taxes during Aldermen meeting

BYLINE: Anna Johnson, Times-News, Burlington, N.C.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 272 words


April 07--ELON -- The Elon Board of Aldermen met for a quick agenda-setting
meeting discussing advertising delinquent taxes, upgrading the town hall meeting
room and additional safety measures on Lebanon Avenue.

All of the issues discussed Monday night are scheduled to be voted on during the
board's regular meeting April 14.

The board will consider posting a print advertisement of the town's 2014
delinquent real estate property taxes, totaling more than $11,000. The board
also will consider releasing its 10-year-old taxes for 2004.

Alderman Mark Greene said he was pleased to see the town's tax collection rate
was greater than 99 percent.

The board also will consider a five-year contract with the city of Burlington
for geographic information system services. The town has entered into an
agreement with the city since 2001, and the current contract expires in June.

"It's been a good value for the town," Town Manager Richard White said.

The contact would be for $24,702.50.

Mayor Jerry Tolley asked White about rumors the town might be getting iPads, and
White said it would be part of an overhaul to the town hall chambering,
including putting in new furniture, adding a projector, and giving the board
members iPads for their agendas. White said they are working on a proposal now.

The town also has been approached by Elon University about possibly adding
rumble strips to Lebanon Avenue near the underground pedestrian tunnel. The
university would pay for the installation, White said.

Trouble on trash costly

BYLINE: by AARON AUPPERLEE

LENGTH: 747 words


Picking up garbage isn't a pleasant business.

But neither is collecting on delinquent trash bills.

Cities and boroughs across Allegheny County continue to pick up garbage despite
residents owing thousands of dollars in unpaid trash bills. There is just no
good way to make people pay, municipal officials said.

"It's a rock and a hard place," said Robert Callen, manager of financially
troubled Munhall. "If you shut it off and didn't pick up the trash, then you
would have a health and welfare issue."

Uncollected trash can cause a public health hazard. It becomes habitat for mice,
rats and other rodents, said Guillermo Cole, a spokesman for the Allegheny
County Health Department. The department investigates complaints and then cites
property owners.

Municipalities are not cited for or forced to clean up piles of garbage.

"If they don't pick up the trash, then it's just going to accumulate there,"
Cole said. "It's a bigger problem than having an unpaid trash bill."

Some municipalities do not worry about individual trash bills. Pittsburgh and
Whitaker do not charge for garbage collection. Wilkins includes trash collection
fees with annual tax bills.

But other municipalities are trying to collect on delinquent trash bills.
Munhall, with a budget of $6.7 million for 2014, goes to court to make residents
pay delinquent trash bills. Since the beginning of the year, the borough has
sued 46 residents for more than $75,500 in delinquent trash bills, according to
the court records.

"This is a new, concentrated effort," said Callen, who was hired in March. "For
too long, delinquent rate payers were not aggressively pursued. It is extremely
unfair and unconscionable that responsible rate payers and taxpayers are
expected to underwrite delinquents and those that choose to manipulate the
system."

Callen suspects that most delinquent trash accounts are for rental properties.
William and Barbara Testa owe $2,584.25 in back trash bills for their rental
property on Charles Street. The landlords did not pay their trash bill between
1994 and 2003 and 2011 and 2013, according to court records.

Barbara Testa, 67, of Munhall, said they did not pay their garbage bills when
the Charles Street house was not occupied, believing that if there were no
garbage cans in front of the house, there would be no garbage pick up.

"I don't think it's fair that we have to pay garbage when no one lives there,"
Barbara Testa said. "I kept explaining to them, "[#x2dc]I'm not going to pay for
something we're not using.' "

In the end, the Testas won't pay their delinquent garbage bill. A young couple
looking to fix up the house intends to buy it for what the Testas owe in back
garbage bills and taxes.

Wilmerding, which is owed about $81,000 in back trash bills, penalties and
interest, is considering taking trash deadbeats to court, said John Thomas, a
council member and chair of the finance committee. He said landlords and
longtime residents don't pay their bills, cutting into the borough's $798,900
budget.

"What is our recourse?" Thomas asked, noting that about 99 percent of residents
are current on their water, which can be shut off for nonpayment. "I know we're
not unique."

Wilmerding, like many Allegheny County communities, contracts with Waste
Management Inc. to handle trash collection. Waste Management, which either
collects trash and bills residents or collects trash and bills the municipality,
depending on the contract, has about 352,000 customers in Western Pennsylvania,
said Erika Deyarmin, a public affairs coordinator for the company.

If Waste Management collects trash and bills the municipality "" and the
municipality is current on its bill "" the company continues to collect trash at
individual homes whether the resident is paid up or not.

If the company collects trash and bills, the residents are at risk of having
their trash service shut off if a bill isn't paid after 75 days, Deyarmin said.

"We work closely with the municipalities and the local governments to make sure
there are no health issues," Deyarmin said, adding each situation is different
and declining to give further details.

Tarentum bundles trash, water and electric into one bill. If a resident falls
behind on payments, the electric goes first, said borough Manager Bill Rossey,
adding there are not many delinquent accounts.

"That works well for us," he said.

B of A Keeps Selling MSRs, Independents Want More

BYLINE: Brian Collins

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 1 Vol. 37 No. 16

LENGTH: 651  words


Bank of America is slimming down its servicing portfolio by selling mortgage
servicing rights and reducing the number of delinquent loans on its books.

And there seems to be a big appetite for these assets on the part of independent
mortgage servicing shops such as Nationstar Mortgage Holdings Inc., Walter
Investment Management Corp. and Ocwen Financial Corp.

B of A serviced $1.14 trillion in loans for other investors at the end of third
quarter. Last week the giant bank sold the MSRs on 2 million loans with unpaid
principal of $300 billion to Nationstar and WIMC.

The MSRs included 232,000 loans that were 60 days or more past due.

The sale reduced the bank's MSR portfolio down to $814 billion and the number of
delinquent loans from 775,000 at yearend 2012 to 543,000 as of Jan. 7, the day
the sales were announced.

Bank of America wants to reduce its delinquent loan count down to the 200,000 to
300,000 range through MSR sales and loan modifications.

"The strategy of selling MSRs is part of our overall effort to improve the
efficiency and capacity of our mortgage unit and reduce the risk to the
company," said B of A spokesman Jerry Dubrowski. "There will be others," he
added. (There are reports that Ocwen is in talks with B of A to buy MSRs.)

To free up single-family MSRs for last week's sale, Bank of America ended a
year-long dispute with Fannie Mae over loan repurchases.

Bank of America entered into a $10.3 billion settlement with Fannie Mae to
resolve repurchase issues involving mortgages B of A and Countrywide sold to the
GSE from 2000 through 2008.

Under the settlement, the nationwide bank agreed to make a $3.55 billion cash
payment to Fannie and repurchase 30,000 loans for $6.75 billion.

The Charlotte, N.C.-based banking company will also pay Fannie $1.3 billion to
resolve loan servicing compensatory fee obligations.

As part of the deal, Fannie agreed to approve B of A's request to transfer the
servicing rights of 941,000 loans to the specialty servicers.

Walter Investment Management Corp. purchased MSRs on 650,000 Fannie loans from
Bank of America with a UPB of $93 billion.

WIMC chief financial officer Charles Cauthen told investors and analysts during
a conference call that all the loans are Fannie loans and 80% are current and
20% delinquent.

The Tampa, Fla.-based mortgage servicer and originator is looking to refinance
over 45% of those loans through the Home Affordable Refinance Program.

"The ability to utilize the ResCap origination platform to mine this potential
pool of customers and target them for refinancing provides a very significant
opportunity to generate meaningful origination revenue and margins in 2013,"
Cauthen said. WIMC is slated to complete the ResCap acquisition on Jan. 31.

WIMC also announced the acquisition of the MetLife Bank servicing platform last
week, which does not include any servicing rights. WIMC executives are looking
to retain about 300 of the MetLife servicing employees and managers.

B of A will transfer the MSRs to WIMC over several quarters.

Nationstar acquired MSRs on 1.3 million loans with a UPB of $215 billion from B
of A and doubled the size of its servicing portfolio.

Over 50% of the servicing involves private-label loans. The other 47% are
government-guaranteed loans-approximately $40 billion Fannie Mae, $20 billion
Freddie Mac and $40 billion Ginnie Mae.

Under questions from equity analysis, Nationstar executives insisted that
Nationstar can grow its existing servicing platform to handle this acquisition
since the boarding will be staged over time. And they won't need to buy another
servicing platform.

Nationstar chief executive Jay Bray said Nationstar would hire additional
origination and servicing staff to support the growth.

"We will supplement that with some potential resources from B of A. There is an
opportunity to pick up some folks as part of this," the CEO said. Nationstar is
based in Lewisville, Texas.

Help Desk: City vs. delinquent property owners

BYLINE: By Juliana Reyes

SECTION: NEWS; P-com Opinion; Pg. WEB

LENGTH: 776 words



Even before a fire ravaged Kensington&rsquo;s Thomas W. Buck Hosiery building
and led to the deaths of two firefighters, the building was a symbol of the
city&rsquo;s struggles with delinquent property owners. Yechiel, Michael and
Nahman Lichtenstein, who own 31 properties in Philadelphia, owe almost $400,000
in back property taxes, more than $10,000 in unpaid water bills, and have
numerous outstanding Licenses and Inspections violations. That&rsquo;s the Holy
Trinity of delinquent property ownership.

What does the city do when property owners are delinquent in each of these
areas? And why don&rsquo;t the problems always get resolved? Help Desk is
focused this week on those questions. Hit us with your city service complaints
for next week.

Unpaid property taxes

What should happen: If you don&rsquo;t pay your property taxes, you get a
certified letter in January telling you pay up by March 31. If you still
don&rsquo;t pay, the city will send you a letter every other month, and your tax
bill will keep growing, thanks to accumulating interest. At some point, the city
will take you to court. If you still don&rsquo;t pay, your house will be put up
for sheriff sale.

Why it doesn&rsquo;t always work: As the Daily News reported in 2010, many tax-
delinquent properties don&rsquo;t get sent to sheriff sale for decades. Two
years ago, the city promised to crack down on property-tax delinquents and send
600 properties to sheriff sale per month, instead of the meager 90 properties it
was previously sending. But the city hasn&rsquo;t fully delivered. Last week,
the Inquirer reported that since last July, the city has been sending an average
of 202 properties to sheriff sale per month. Plus, not every property sent to
sheriff sale actually gets sold.

Unpaid water bills

What should happen: Once you rack up an unpaid water bill of $75, the Water
Revenue Bureau can shut your water off. The bureau will send you two notices
about the impending shut-off (one, if you have a commercial property). Once your
unpaid bill reaches $150, the city can take you to Municipal Court.

A judge there will issue you a fine that will be attached to all the properties
you own, rather than just place a lien on the problem property.

Why it doesn&rsquo;t always work: The Water Revenue Bureau says that a
property&rsquo;s water is generally shut off before legal action is taken. But
this doesn&rsquo;t always happen, and the legal process can take a while. At the
Buck Hosiery building, the Lichtensteins owed more than $10,000 in water bills
from 2010 and 2011. Apparently, someone forgot to shut the water off.

The city also sometimes struggles with locating delinquent owners. Municipal
Court cases are automatically dismissed if &ldquo;service&rdquo; can&rsquo;t be
made, meaning the property owner isn&rsquo;t officially notified. The city could
almost certainly do a better job of this, though: The three times it tried to
take the Lichtensteins to court for unpaid water bills, service was attempted at
the vacant Buck Hosiery building and the cases were dismissed.

L&I violations

What should happen: If you&rsquo;re not maintaining your property &mdash; say,
your front yard is full of garbage and has attracted rats &mdash; L&I will issue
you a violation. Generally, you get three chances, 90 days total, to fix the
problem, though there are certain cases in which a property owner will get fewer
chances if a property is an immediate danger. After that, the city will take you
to Municipal Court. This is a fairly new effort &mdash; before the Nutter
administration, there was no L&I policy of consistently taking property owners
to court.

In Municipal Court, a judge will issue you a fine that will be attached to all
the properties you own. Repeat offenders or serious cases can also be sent to
Common Pleas Court, which can order you to fix the problem, increase your fines,
and keep pestering you.

Why it doesn&rsquo;t always work: Common Pleas Court is an important hammer in
this process, but L&I doesn&rsquo;t routinely escalate cases there. Take the
Lichtensteins: Since 2009, L&I took them to Municipal Court eight times for
eight different properties. Out of those cases, half were dismissed because the
city couldn&rsquo;t make service. Only one property was eventually taken to
Common Pleas. n

As Huntsman runs, family firm missed paying tax

BYLINE: By Lee Davidson The Salt Lake Tribune

SECTION: POLITICS; News; State

LENGTH: 800 words


Jon Huntsman has complained during his presidential campaign that too-high
corporate taxes hurt business and job creation. His family's chemical firm --
the Huntsman Corp. -- may have found an unorthodox way to deal with that, at
least temporarily.

It did not pay its 2011 Salt Lake County property taxes on time for its world
headquarters. The bill: $195,100, including penalties so far.

"I'm sure it was just an oversight. It will be taken care of," said Tom Muir, a
vice president at Huntsman Corp. Jon Huntsman has not been a corporate officer
for years of the company, which was founded and is chaired by his father. But
the company generated the family fortune that has helped to finance much of the
former Utah governor's presidential race so far.

Huntsman is not the only one perhaps embarrassed by new delinquent taxpayer
lists. Dan Liljenquist, who just resigned from the state Senate and is expected
to run for the U.S. Senate against incumbent Orrin Hatch, failed to pay his
taxes on time. And several well-known businesses also were on lists -- led by
Intermountain Healthcare failing to pay more than $1 million in taxes on time.

Counties in Utah began over the holiday weekend posting lists of delinquent
taxpayers for 2011. Timing for disclosing the missed payment by the Huntsman
Corp. may be unfortunate for Jon Huntsman, coming a week before the Jan. 10 New
Hampshire primary -- the first he is contesting.

The Huntsman Corp.'s world headquarters are in a sleek, modern building high on
a hill overlooking the University of Utah's Research Park. Salt Lake County
records show it owed, as of Monday, $145,600 in 2011 property taxes and
penalties on the three-story building, which tax records said has 82,850 square
feet of office space.

It owed another $49,500 in "privilege tax" on the 10 acres where the building
sits, on land technically owned by the University of Utah. The Huntsman Corp.
was No. 5 on the list of Top 10 tax delinquents in Salt Lake, Utah and Davis
counties.

Meanwhile, Liljenquist said he was shocked to hear from The Tribune that he was
on the delinquent taxpayer list -- and said his wife Brooke immediately drove
Tuesday to Davis County offices to pay the $2,904 in late taxes and penalties
owed. Tax records show his Bountiful home has a market value of $348,373.

"It was just an oversight," he said. He explained that he had just paid off his
mortgage. So this was the first year he was responsible for paying the taxes
himself, instead of the mortgage company.

"We're also in the process of remodeling our home, so we've had our mail
forwarded to us to another address." He said he and his wife do not remember a
tax notice arriving in their forwarded mail.

Landing on the delinquent list comes as he is expected to announce soon that he
will seek the Republican nomination against incumbent Hatch for the U.S. Senate.
"We obviously believe in paying our full taxes," Liljenquist said.

Intermountain Healthcare was No. 1 on the list of delinquent taxpayers, owing a
total of $1.13 million.

Most of that -- $1.03 million -- was for taxes on the large Intermountain
Medical Center in Murray. The rest was for land it bought for a new warehouse.

Jess Gomez, spokesman for Intermountain Medical Center, said the taxes were paid
early Tuesday.

"We had sent a check on Nov. 29, a day before the deadline" for paying taxes on
the hospital, Gomez said. "We're not sure what happened, but that check was
lost."

He said the company did not appear to receive a tax notice for the warehouse
property, which had still been listed -- as of August -- on county rolls under
the name of the previous owner who sold the property to Intermountain in 2010.

Most others atop delinquency lists are developers. County treasurers have said
for years that developers often use non-payment as a sort of "cheap loan," that
does not require an application fee and has interest akin to what they would pay
from other lenders.

Of course, if taxes are not paid within five years, the counties seize the
property and sell it for the back taxes.

Among some developers near the top of delinquency lists were Midtown Joint
Venture in Utah County, $304,034; Cottonwood Estates Development of Salt Lake
County, $298,435; Mountain Home Development Corp. of Utah County, $205,202; and
Lehi Pointe, $192,195.

Several other well-known companies also were on delinquency lists.

Some include: Singh Petroleum (which operates several Conoco/Circle K
convenience stores in Salt Lake and Davis counties), $157,643; the Hotel Peery
in downtown Salt Lake City, $69,097; Performax Gyms, $60,471; Lehi Roller Mills,
$56,592; Syracuse Stadium Cinemas, $44,782; Barnes Banking (which went into
receivership in 2010), $52,348; and Davis Lanes, $26,413.

West Virginia: Former Coal Co. CEO Don Blankenship Indicted, Outlaw Coal
Operations Skirting Penalties and More

LENGTH: 274  words

DATELINE: Charleston


West Virginia Public Broadcasting has issued the following news release:

nce considered untouchable, former Massey Energy CEO Don Blankenship was
indicted on four federal charges in connection with the Upper Big Branch
Disaster that killed 29 men in 2010. It's news that folks in the coalfields
never thought would happen.

In this episode, we'll hear a special investigative series of reports about
outlaw coal mining companies that keep operating despite injuries, violations
and millions in fines.

And a new lawsuit has just been filed on behalf of the 78 coal miners who died
in the Farmington Mine Disaster. We'll hear memories from Sarah Kasnoski, one of
the widows who lost her husband on that fateful date, November 20, 1968.

Investigating Outlaw Mines That Keep Operating Despite Delinquent Fines

A recent investigative report has uncovered that some coal companies are working
the system to avoid paying fines. The report also finds a connection between
skirted financial penalties and injured coal miners: mines with more delinquent
fines also have higher rates of injured workers.

NPR and Mine Safety and Health News sifted through citations, and documents for
more than a year to find the connection. NPR's Howard Berkes says it was no easy
task. Each delinquent fine has a different start date, so tracking the injuries
associated with the delinquent fines was complicated. In this episode, we hear
the first three of these reports. We also talk with Berkes about mine safety and
the development of these investigations.

County OKs sale of delinquent tax properties

BYLINE: Gary Nelson, Crossville Chronicle, Tenn.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 329 words


June 25--CROSSVILLE -- County Commissioners approved the sale of 51 delinquent
tax properties during Monday night's monthly commission meeting.

A total of three resolutions were approved for the property sales. One party
purchased 49 properties, which are all lots in the Lake Tansi Community.

Resolution 06-2012-16 was for the acceptance of an offer and sale of 49 parcels
of property in Lake Tansi to a company by the name of U.S. Assets. The offer was
to pay $50 per lot for a total of $2,450.

The resolution was approved after Allen Foster, 4th District commissioner,
motioned for approval. Foster's motion was supported by Dave Hassler, 3rd
District commissioner.

The Cumberland County Delinquent Property Tax Committee met prior to the county
commission meeting to review and approve the sale of the tax properties.

"Most of the properties have been off the tax roles for years. By doing this
we're getting rid of them and getting them back on the tax roles," Nancy Hyder,
2nd District commissioner and chair of the Delinquent Tax Committee, said.

First District Commissioner Harry Sabine expressed a legal concern regarding the
sale of the 49 properties to a company and asked if county attorney Randal
Boston would be reviewing the sale of the properties.

Boston said he would be reviewing the specifics of the sale.

Also approved was resolution 06-2012-14 to accept the offer of $381.18 from
Michael Dandera to purchase property from the county at lot 65 on Walker Dr. at
Lake Park. The offer was for the full amount owed on the property.

Resolution 06-2012-15 was also approved for the sale of a parcel of land at 204
Lancaster Dr. in Fairfield Glade. The offer of $50 to purchase the property was
accepted by the county from Dan Friel.

All of the property sale resolutions were unanimously approved.

B$750 in Mortgage Debt Past Due

BYLINE: Paul Muolo and Amilda Dymi

SECTION: Pg. 1 Vol. 13 No. 3

LENGTH: 493  words


Washington-The national mortgage delinquency rate - which includes both prime
and subprime mortgages - climbed to a record 7.88% in the fourth quarter with
subprime late payments reaching a staggering 21.88%, according to new figures
released by the Mortgage Bankers Association.

Figures compiled by Mortgage Servicing News show that Americans owe $9.6
trillion on their loans, which means $756 billion in residential mortgage debt
is delinquent. Also, $196 billion in subprime debt is 30 days or more late.

Prime foreclosures started in the quarter increased to 1.88% of outstanding
loans, double last year's rate. The only positive in the numbers: the rate at
which homes are going into foreclosure was flat but as MBA chief economist Jay
Brinkmann noted, "This is mainly attributable to various state and local
moratoria on foreclosure sales" and similar actions taken by Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac.

But even though the rate of foreclosures may be flat the foreclosure inventory
numbers are huge, 6.3% of all loans and 23.11% of subprime mortgages are
seriously delinquent or in foreclosure. The South and Midwest have the highest
delinquency rates, 9.4% and 8.58%, respectively.

To the surprise of no one, subprime ARMs continue to be a major problem for the
industry. At year-end, only 52% of all subprime ARMs nationwide were current.

But other loan types are going delinquent in record numbers as well. "When we
look at where the changes are coming, clearly we see increases in the prime
fixed and subprime fixed categories," said Mr. Brinkmann.

One concern is that although California, Florida and Nevada are leading the
foreclosure charts, the problem has spread to states like New York and its
metropolitan area, which has suffered huge severe job losses because of Wall
Street's crash.

Also, across the nation servicers saw an increase in delinquencies among college
educated, prime loan borrowers who are losing their jobs, too.

If earlier delinquencies were caused by predatory lending and poor underwriting
- resulting in mortgages being made to consumers who should not have received
them - recent late payers have been hurt by a tremendously weak job market which
may not improve until 2010.

Meanwhile, the mortgage delinquency rate for borrowers 60 or more days past due
increased for the eighth straight quarter, reaching 4.58% in the fourth quarter,
a 53% increase from the same period a year ago, according to a new report from
TransUnion, Chicago.

In the third quarter the ratio, a national average, stood at 3.96%. Borrower
delinquency rates in the fourth quarter were highest in Florida (9.52%) and
Nevada (9.01%), while the lowest rates were found in North Dakota (1.21%),
Alaska (1.74%) and South Dakota (1.97%).

The three areas showing the greatest percentage growth in delinquency from the
previous quarter were Arizona (26.2%), Montana (24.5%) and South Dakota (23.9%).

Consistent with past reports, subprime and ARMs showed the highest overdue.

Dec. 19--The teen who took a pellet gun to Scott High School earlier this month,
causing panic and a standoff with Toledo police, has pleaded guilty to several
charges.

Louis Stroude, Jr., 14, was found delinquent Wednesday of illegal conveyance of
a deadly weapon for having a knife in his book bag, possession of an object
indistinguishable from a gun, and inducing panic.

The Stroude youth is to be sentenced on Jan. 16.

Toledo police were called to the central city high school on Dec. 2 for a report
of a student with a gun.

After more than an hour-long standoff with the teen, the boy was taken into
custody and officers found the gun was not real, though it looked real, police
said.

Ohio tax amnesty lasts through June 15;
Delinquent taxpayers can settle tax debts and escape penalties.;
COLUMBUS BUREAU

BYLINE: By Jackie Borchardt

SECTION: LOCAL; Pg. B1

LENGTH: 413 words


COLUMBUS - Delinquent taxpayers can settle their debts to the state and escape
costly penalties if they come clean through June 15. The state Department of
Taxation will forgive any penalties and half the interest on unreported or
underreported taxes levied before May 1, 2011, through Ohio's first tax amnesty
program in six years.

Voluntary payees also receive amnesty from any criminal charges for avoiding
their taxpaying duties. Amnesty does not apply to taxpayers issued a billing or
assessment notice or requested for an audit.

Nearly $500,000 was collected on the first day of the program and state
officials estimate more than $36 million in owed local taxes will be collected
by the end of the program. State Tax Commissioner Joseph Testa said most tax
errors are unintentional and the revenue collected during amnesty periods
prevents the state from raising taxes.

States consider tax amnesty programs a win-win - delinquent payers get a break
and states get revenue otherwise lost. Since the recession, 23 states and the
District of Columbia have offered amnesty periods and Nevada had two, according
to the Federation of Tax Administrators.

This year's tax amnesty is Ohio's third - the state collected $48.1 million
between October 2001 and January 2002 and $63 million during January and
February 2006. Eligible taxes include individual income, commercial activity,
employer withholding, corporation franchise and estate taxes.

Testa said this year's collection will be far less because many state taxes have
been reduced or eliminated since 2006. He said the estimate is based on factors
such as past collections and amounts collected in other states. Also, the pool
of those who have underreported or not filed has thinned because of recent
technology that tracks pay data with tax filings.

Testa said those who take advantage of the amnesty program save an average 25
percent of what they would pay after an audit.

For example, if a person with a tax liability of $2,000 didn't pay for four
years, he or she would pay $8,000 in back taxes plus $11,000 in penalties. Under
amnesty, the bill would be $8,400.

Testa said six years is an appropriate span between amnesty periods because it
encourages people not to wait for the next one. "The whole idea of amnesty is to
let people know now is the time to come forward and bring things current in the
least expensive way ... ."

BRIEF: Juvenile found delinquent in felonious assault case

BYLINE: The Blade, Toledo, Ohio

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 170 words


June 21--A Toledo teen was found delinquent today of felonious assault with a
gun specification.

Deshawn Woods, 15, pleaded to the charges, which accused him of shooting Kevion
Jones, 16, on June 8 at Cherry and Bancroft streets in North Toledo.

The Woods youth is scheduled to be sentenced July 2.

Lucas County Juvenile Court Judge Connie Zemmelman has discretion on the gun
specification and can sentence the teen to 1, 2, or 3 years in the Department of
Youth Services; a 1-year sentence on the felonious assault charge is mandatory,
but the teen could spend up to age 21 in DYS.

Prosecutor Lori Olender, who oversees the juvenile division, offered to not move
forward with adult certification for the teen if he accepted the plea deal.

In court today, the teen agreed that he used a gun, which was tucked into a
shirt sleeve, to shoot twice at the Jones youth after the victim "threw a
punch."

U.S. distressed housing falls to October '08 levels, CoreLogic reports

BYLINE: Ted Carter

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 552  words


n a sign the nation's housing foreclosure crisis could be easing, the number of
distressed dwellings that make up a "shadow inventory" has decreased across the
country to fall 2008 levels, reports CoreLogic, a California-based real estate
research firm.

Short sales and sales of bank-owned houses are driving down the inventory,
CoreLogic says, and notes the reduction of the shadow inventory should help slow
declines in housing prices..

CoreLogic reported Thursday that the current residential shadow inventory as of
April 2012 fell to 1.5 million units, representing a supply of four months. This
was a 14.8 percent drop from April 2011, when shadow inventory stood at 1.8
million units, or a six-months' supply, which is about the same level as the
country was experiencing in October 2008.

The research firm says the volume of distressed (short and real estate owned)
sales has largely offset the flow of new seriously delinquent (90 days or more)
loans into the shadow inventory.

CoreLogic estimates the current stock of properties in the shadow inventory,
also known as pending supply, by calculating the number of distressed properties
that are seriously delinquent, in foreclosure and held as real estate owned
(REO) by mortgage servicers but not currently listed on multiple listing
services (MLSs). Transition rates of "delinquency to foreclosure" and
"foreclosure to REO" are used to identify the currently distressed non-listed
properties most likely to become REO properties.

Properties that are not yet delinquent but may become delinquent in the future
are not included in the estimate of the current shadow inventory. Shadow
inventory is typically not included in the official metrics of unsold inventory.

"Since peaking at 2.1 million units in January 2010, the shadow inventory has
fallen by 28 percent. The decline in the shadow inventory is a positive
development because it removes some of the downward pressure on house prices,"
said Mark Fleming, chief economist for CoreLogic. "This is one of the reasons
why some markets that were formerly identified as deeply distressed, like
Arizona, California and Nevada, are now experiencing price increases. "

Here are highlights of CoreLogic's findings on the shadow inventory:

* As of April 2012, shadow inventory fell to 1.5 million units, or four-month
supply and represented just over half of the 2.8 million properties currently
seriously delinquent, in foreclosure or REO.

* The four-month supply of shadow inventory is at its lowest level in nearly
three years. It parallels the unsold months' supply of non-distressed active

McClain County wants taxes paid;
Program targets mobile home owners

BYLINE: Ellie Sutter, Staff Writer

SECTION: NORMAN/METRO VI; Pg. 15A

LENGTH: 454 words

DATELINE: PURCELL


McClain County Sheriff Don Hewett has hired a deputy whose main job is to help
the county treasurer locate mobile homes on which property taxes have not been
paid.

Treasurer Twana Haley said about 80 percent of the money collected in delinquent
taxes from mobile home owners will go to schools.

"The schools need the money, and this is one way we can help out," He wett said.


The McClain County program was started at the first of the year after Deputy
Todd Oden had been trained as a county tax warrant deputy.

Other metro counties that have the deputy tax warrant program in place include
Cleveland, Canadian, Grady, Kingfisher and Oklahoma.

Hewett said until now the program took too much time and too much of the
county's resources. With computer software, it is easier and less costly.

Haley said some people who live in mobile homes forget they owe taxes. It also
is hard to collect taxes on them because they are mobile, she said.

She reminds residents that whenever they buy or sell a mobile home they need to
call their county assessor and ask for a 936 form to report the transaction.

She said when the program started, there were about 90 delinquent tax accounts.

"If anyone lives in a mobile home, they need to be paying taxes yearly," she
said.

When Haley issues a warrant for delinquent taxes, she gives it to Oden. Then he
serves the warrant.

When he locates the owners, he tells them they have 10 days to pay the
delinquent taxes. If payment is not made within the 10 days, a second notice is
issued that gives the taxpayer 24 hours to pay the delinquent tax. If they fail
to pay the delinquent tax, a process is started to seize the property, Oden
said.

If the lien holder is a bank or mortgage company, Oden said he contacts that
financial institution to notify it of the delinquent tax and that a tax warrant
has been issued.

Oden said this will generally generate action by the lien holder.

If the lien holder does not contact the treasurer's office or if the property
does not have a lien against it, the property will be sold at a sheriff's sale
to pay the delinquent tax.

Haley said she doesn't know how much money the new program will generate.

Canadian County Treasurer David Radcliff said his county's program has collected
$825,000 since its inception in July 2001.

Taxes on mobile homes are considered a personal property tax, and some people
mistakenly think their county has repealed personal property tax.

Jeff Spelman, a spokesman with the Oklahoma Tax Commission, said it was the
household personal property tax that was repealed. Of the nine metro area
counties, only Lincoln County residents have not repealed it.

Personal property tax is still collected on mobile homes, business inventory and
farm equipment, he said.

Printing names of owners behind in assessments is risky in Florida

BYLINE: HARRY WOOD

SECTION: AT HOME; Condominiums; Pg. 8H

LENGTH: 1037 words



Question: We have an unusually large number of maintenance    deadbeats,
including the president of our board. Naturally, this    results in problems and
difficulties in meeting current bills and    payrolls.

     Although we have suggested many times that our condo newspaper list    the
delinquents, our board insists that it is illegal and can't be    done. We have
referred them to other condominium newspapers that do    list their delinquents,
but to no avail.

     Does our board have good reason for its position? We believe that
publishing the names might stimulate those named to pay. We would    appreciate
your comments on this problem. - M.H.        Answer: I don't know of any Florida
court decision that    specifically addresses your problem. There is, however,
an Ohio    appellate court decision in the case of Mushket vs. Pickawillany

 Condominium Unit Owners Association (Franklin Circuit Case No.    80AP-765),
which dealt with the publication of minutes that contained    the names of unit
owners delinquent in the payment of assessments.

     The court there held that the condominium association had a right    to
inform its members which owners were delinquent in the payment of    their
assessments. This is so because the owners who paid on time had a    right to
know who did not and also because the information was    available to a limited
group of people.

     In Florida the publication of the names of delinquents in a condo
newspaper, which can be seen by persons not entitled to that    information, may
subject the association to an action for violation of    the consumer Collection
Practices Act. Under that law one may not    publish or post before the general
public names of deadbeats for the    purpose of enforcing collection of consumer
claims.



 Reasons to disqualify buyers

   Question: Upon what legal grounds can the screening committee    disqualify a
prospective purchaser of a condo apartment? The committee    is getting carried
away with its so-called power and placing all kinds    of obstacles to
discourage people they don't like. - E.L.        Answer: In Laguna Royale Owners
Association vs. Darger (174    Cal.Rep.136), an appellate court of California
wrote that it is    essential to successful condominium living and the
maintenance of value    that the owners as a group have the authority to
reasonably regulate    the use and sale of apartments.

     However, in exercising that power, the association must act in a    fair
and nondiscriminatory manner, withholding approval only for    reasons related
to the protection, preservation and proper operation of    the property and the
purposes of the association as set forth in its    governing instruments.

     Also, federal, state and municipal laws forbid discrimination    because of
race, color, religion, ancestry, age, sex, physical    handicap, marital status
or place of birth.



 Cable TV as a common expense

   Question: In July 1986 our board gave the cable television company
permission to wire our building for cable. We were told that whoever    wanted
cable could have it and whoever did not want it did not have to    subscribe and
there would be no charge.

     Now our board is pushing for an amendment of our declaration of
condominium to make cable TV a common expense. If it succeeds we will
automatically be forced to pay for cable. Can the board assess me for    cable
charges and add same to my maintenance even though I don't want    cable? - L.B.

        Answer: Florida's Condominium Act (Sec.718.115) states that common
expenses include the expenses of the operation, maintenance, repair or
replacement of the common elements, costs of carrying out the powers    and
duties of the association and any other expense designated as    common expense
by this charter, the declaration, the documents creating    the condominium or
the bylaws.

     It is unfortunate that no Florida court to my knowledge has passed    on
whether an amendment of the declaration or the bylaws may include    cable TV as
a common expense. The only appellate decision was rendered    by the
Intermediate Court of Appeals of Hawaii in the case of D'Elia    vs. Association
of Apartment Owners of Fairway Manor, reported in 632    Pac.2d.296.

     The court held legal and enforceable an amendment to the bylaws and
declaration that added cable expenses to common expenses in a situation    where
common expenses already included utility charges and air    conditioning
maintenance.



 Tennis courts need attention

   Question: It is my understanding that a condo must maintain the    common
grounds regardless of cost. We have two tennis courts that are    used by very
few. Consequently, the courts have not been maintained and    are now in very
poor condition. I would like the courts resurfaced and    put in playable
condition.

     The board's contention is that, since only a handful of people play
tennis, it does not have to spend the money. It's my contention that
regardless of how many people use the tennis courts it is the board's
obligation to properly maintain them. What say you? Also, can the board    vote
to eliminate the courts entirely? - E.S.        Answer: As long as the tennis
courts are part of the common    elements, it is the duty and responsibility of
the condominium to    properly maintain them. Total elimination of the tennis
courts would    constitute a material alteration of the common elements. The
condominium act states that there shall be no material alteration of
T the common elements except in a manner provided in the declaration of
condominium.

     What provision, if any, is made in your condominium's declaration    for
material alteration of the common elements?

County to crack down on late paying utility users

BYLINE: Doris Cook, Star Beacon, Ashtabula, Ohio

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 438 words


Sep. 6--JEFFERSON -- More than 600 users of the Ashtabula County water and sewer
systems owe money and haven't paid back bills for months. These customers are
now being certified to County Auditor Roger Corlett's office for collection on
the 2008 property tax list.

Ashtabula County Department of Environment Services certified this week the list
of tardy customers to Ashtabula County commissioners for action. The board
approved passing the list on to Corlett.

DES utilities administrator Vicky Ledford and DES director, Larry Meaney stated
there are 221 delinquent water customers owing $37,173.50.

Another 379 customers on the county's sewer services are delinquent for
$110,932.98 on bills. Five customers, who buy bulk water from the county
department, owe $791.30, Ledford said.

"If people during the year question their bills we offer to give them a
duplicate bill. We've tightened the rules for cutting off water or sewer
service," she said.

"The bulk of the people still owing money are rental property tenants. They
leave the houses and don't pay the bills. Landlords of these properties are
obligated to pay the bills, but the tenants are often listed with us as the
customer," Meaney said.

Ledford said the county DES must certify the delinquent accounts to the county
auditor's office by the second Monday in September to be placed on the property
tax duplicate. The county currently has 5,300 water user accounts and 3,000
sewer user accounts.

Meaney said that unlike private utility companies, the county can't write off
losses from delinquent customers failing to pay their utility bills.

"It would force us to raise rates for every customer," he added.

Ledford said that the DES continues to accept payments up to Aug. 30 from
delinquent customers before the list is certified to Corlett's office. The
cut-off date for compiling the list of the tardy bill paying customers is June
30.

Proposed House Bill 304 pending before the Ohio General Assembly relating to
collections process changes, Meaney said, would greatly limit counties like
Ashtabula to be able to certify delinquent utility accounts to a county auditor.

"In its present language, this bill would be an administrative nightmare for
us," he added.

County due $ 53-million in late property taxes

BYLINE: JENNIFER ORSI

SECTION: BRANDON TIMES; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 359 words

DATELINE: TAMPA



More people couldn't or didn't pay their property taxes this year, boosting the
amount of delinquent taxes by 15.6 percent over last year, Hillsborough County's
tax collector said.

    The delinquent tax total those taxes not paid by April 1 was $ 52.6-million
this year, compared with $ 45.5-million last year, Tax Collector Melvin Smith
said.

    "I guess people just didn't have the money," Smith said. "I have no way of
knowing why. I guess all of us know the economy's not what it was."

    Smith said that despite the increase in overdue taxes, he probably will
collect almost all of the $ 613,374,959 due the county, its cities and other
taxing authorities from the 1990 tax rolls.

    That's because the county auctions off delinquent tax bills to investors who
pay the taxes and then gain a claim on the property plus interest on the overdue
amount.

    This year's auction will be at 9:30 a.m. May 20 at the Days Inn, 515 E Cass
St., in the second-floor Summit Room.

    Smith said the auction mostly attracts individuals who buy the tax sale
certificates. But lately, more banks
 have been getting involved, he said.

    The investors bid for the certificates by interest rates. The rate is what
the property owner must pay in addition to their delinquent tax bill. When the
bill is paid, the investor collects the interest. The bidding starts at 18
percent, and the bidder with the lowest rate is awarded the certificate.

    The delinquent tax bills take precedence over other claims on the property,
including first mortgages, Smith said. Eventually, if the property owners don't
pay the taxes, the holders of the tax  certificates can foreclose.

    Smith said he usually collects about 97.5 percent of the assessed taxes.
Government agencies by law are allowed to budget only 95 percent of the tax
revenue they expect to get.

    Tax collections began Nov. 1 and were ahead of last year's rate until the
end of December when payments fell behind the previous year, said Joe Benito,
the tax collector's administrator of fiscal and support services.

Reading boy found delinquent in Thun Trail stabbing

BYLINE: Holly Herman, Reading Eagle, Pa.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 373 words


Feb. 27--A Reading boy was found delinquent Tuesday in Berks County Juvenile
Court for conspiring to commit aggravated assault in the Jan. 19 stabbing of a
bicyclist on the Thun Trail in West Reading.

Benjamin Rosario, 14, admitted to Senior Judge Arthur E. Grim that he
participated with others in the stabbing of Sean Rotkiske, 43, who was riding a
bicycle with a 39-year-old friend to his home in Shillington after going to a
party in Reading.

Rosario's lawyer, James M. Polyak of Reading, said Rosario admitted he was with
a group when the stabbing occurred, but denied stabbing the victim.

As a result of the plea, a charge of attempted murder was withdrawn. Police said
the case is under investigation.

Grim deferred disposition until a psychiatric evaluation is conducted.

Rosario was ordered to remain in Abraxas Academy, New Morgan, until final
disposition.

Rotkiske, who suffered three puncture wounds to his left shoulder, said he still
rides on the trail.

"I am fine," he said after the proceeding. "I am not worried about my safety. I
am worried about the general public."

Rotkiske said he is grateful that he does not remember what happened when he was
stabbed.

"They got me by surprise," he said.

Authorities said Rosario was in a group of more than five teens when the
stabbing occurred after 11 p.m.

According to police:

Officers went to Reading Hospital shortly before midnight to interview the
victim, who said he was hit on the head with a bottle and stabbed.

A female and two males who had been with Rosario during the assault also were at
the hospital, but left when police arrived. The teens also had been injured in
the assault.

One of the males, a 14-year-old boy who said he was with the group, later
identified Rosario as the stabber. He has not been charged.

Rosario initially told police he cut his right pinky finger playing a game. He
later admitted to participating in the attack on Rotkiske, but denied stabbing
him.

He identified the other 14-year-old as the stabber.

Rosario was treated in St. Joseph Medical Center.

Jailing deadbeat parents a form of debtors' prison?

BYLINE: Tracey Read, The News-Herald, Willoughby, Ohio

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 780 words


March 29--Nearly two centuries ago, the U.S. Supreme Court abolished the
practice of imprisoning those who are too poor to pay their legal debts.

But the threat of jail time still exists for poor people who are delinquent on
child-support payments.

"It's a heinous situation," said Michael McCormick, executive director for the
American Coalition for Fathers and Children. "Jail just becomes a revolving
door. Child-support lockups are debtors' prisons."

Meanwhile, a South Carolina father who was repeatedly jailed for claiming he
couldn't make child-support payments of about $50 a week is asking the U.S.
Supreme Court to end five states' practice of locking up delinquent parents
without automatically giving them a lawyer.

The case was argued before the nation's highest court last week. Justices are
expected to give their ruling by June.

Michael Turner, a drug addict who had not been working, claims indigent people
who are facing time behind bars for missing payments have a constitutional right
to an attorney at taxpayer expense.

Ohio, Florida, Maine and New Hampshire are the other states where deadbeat
parents are not automatically given a lawyer at all stages in the proceedings in
such cases.

Advocacy groups including the American Civil Liberties Union are backing Turner
in his quest.

"Locking up someone for failure to pay child support doesn't address the
problem," said Carrie Davis, staff counsel for the Ohio ACLU. "When they finally
get out of jail, it's even harder for them to get a job."

Lake County Sheriff Daniel A. Dunlap said judges use jail as a last resort in
child-support cases.

"Debtors' prison never makes much sense in the big scheme of things," said the
sheriff.

"People don't end up in jail until they're very delinquent. We've had a dozen in
jail for nonsupport since the beginning of the year. Some of them just refuse to
pay."

In its ruling against Turner, the South Carolina Supreme Court said a delinquent
parent holds "the keys to his cell because he may end the imprisonment and purge
himself of the sentence at any time" by paying at least some of what is owed.

In addition, state justices added that failing to pay child support is an act of
civil contempt, not a criminal charge for which the state is obligated to
provide representation.

"I'm of the opinion that if you're facing loss of liberty, you're entitled to a
lawyer," said Lake County Public Defender R. Paul LaPlante.

"It will be interesting to see what the Supreme Court does with this. We're kind
of in a quasi-criminal area.

"Even though it might be technically a civil contempt, there is a potential down
the road for incarceration. I believe counsel should be appointed at the
earliest opportunity. Yes, it costs taxpayers money. But we get down to the
argument, what price justice?"

In 2010, the Cuyahoga County Prosecutor's Office and the Cuyahoga County Child
Support Enforcement Agency collected a record $2,081,060 in criminal nonsupport
collections.

The enforcement agency indicted 193 cases in 2010. Of those, 158 were sentenced
to probation, giving a 91 percent payment rate when the case was resolved, said
Ryan Miday, spokesman for the prosecutor's office.

"We apply strict criteria in determining whether or not to pursue felony charges
of criminal nonsupport against individuals who have persisted in their failure
to pay child support," he said.

"Among the criteria taken into consideration is whether an individual has a
history of employment, the ability to pay and the repeated refusal to make
payments."

Miday added that the prosecutor's office occasionally runs "Wanted" posters to
help apprehend defendants who have warrants.

"They are transient employees or job hoppers," he said. "Many also choose to
become self-employed to avoid the risk of a wage garnishment or are paid under
the table. This is common. We charge these defendants because they have
repeatedly failed to pay. Lack of child support has lasting effects on families
in Cuyahoga County, throughout the state and throughout the nation. Lack of
financial support from absent parents can be devastating to the health and
well-being of these children. Custodial parents must rely upon other sources,
often the government, to provide the basic needs of these children when the
absent parent avoids responsibility."

MANCHESTER - A former textile mill that was purchased for almost $2 million in
2014 was sold recently at an auction of tax delinquent properties for about
$57,600.

The owner, St. Rabon Private Equity, has six months to redeem the property at
501 E. Middle Turnpike from the successful bidder.

The accepted bid at the Jan. 10 tax sale was $57,643.94, the tally of unpaid
taxes, water bills and legal fees, assessment and collection director John
Rainaldi said Tuesday. The successful bidder was REO Q42016 LLC of New York
City.

St. Rabon has until July 10 toredeem the property by paying the amount of the
bid, plus monthly interest of 1.5 percent. The agent for St. Rabon is Mark
Rabon. Neither he nor a representative of the successful bidder could be reached
for comment Tuesday.

Based in Scotland, Conn., St. Rabon bought the former Glastonbury Knitting Co.
factory in 2014 for $1.95 million, a price far above the appraised value of
$444,600. The town's former head planning official said at the time that
officials had fielded inquiries about residential uses in the building over the
previous 1 1/2 years.

Located in the special design commercial zone, the building had housed a variety
of businesses, but apartments were not allowed. In 2014, the planning and zoning
commission approved a change to allow residential uses above commercial or
office space for properties in the zone.

However, after purchasing the 19th century building, St. Rabon paid no taxes,
drew no building permit applications and submitted no proposals to the planning
office, officials have said.

The mill building was among eight properties that were auctioned off on Jan. 10.
The town initially had listed 29 tax-delinquent properties to be auctioned, but
most of the property owners paid up before the sale, Rainaldi said. For auction
results, visit www.cttaxsales.com.

A delinquent tax policy adopted in 2013 has prompted more people to pay their
back taxes before losing their homes and businesses, town officials say. By the
time a property is offered in a tax sale, officials say, the town has exhausted
many attempts to get delinquent taxpayers to pay.

Delinquent tax sale auction nets $50G

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 285 words


Sept. 13--EBENSBURG -- Of the 250 properties on the auction block, only 35 were
sold Monday at Cambria County's annual delinquent tax sale, officials said.

The sale brought in $51,879, which is distributed to the county, school
districts and local municipalities, Sam Runzo, director of the county tax claim
bureau, said.

The numbers were up slightly from last year, when 22 properties were sold for
$35,875, he said.

Both last year and again this year, approximately 1,300 properties were
originally advertised for the sale for unpaid taxes. The sale list is in legal
ads run by the bureau in July, with the sales in September.

"The sale itself never produces a lot of buyers. But the threat of the
properties being sold brought in over $2 million in revenues for the county,
school districts and municipalities, with people coming in to pay the back taxes
or get on payment plans," he said.

Most bidders are reluctant to buy the properties at the annual sale, because the
new owners would be responsible for any liens and judgments on them, Runzo said.

The highest price paid at this year's sale was $5,100 by Patricia Hamzik of the
800 block of Chestnut Avenue in Northern Cambria.

She brought a property adjacent to hers on Chestnut Avenue, Runzo said.

Columbia's superintendent retained;
Retiring exec will earn per diem pay while district searches for successor

BYLINE: Lisa Grimaud, Correspondent

SECTION: B; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 637  words

DATELINE: Lancaster, PA


Columbia Borough School District will retain Kenneth Klawitter as a consultant
after he retires June 30 from the superintendent position he has held for seven
years.

The school board appointed him acting superintendent May 18, starting July 1 and
continuing until the district selects his successor.

During a transition period, it is a normal practice for school districts to
bring in a retired superintendent to help, Klawitter said.

Klawitter will be paid a per diem rate based on his 2005-06 annual salary of
$103,839, or $397.85 per day. The payment is a straight stipend. It is not
connected to a retirement package and includes no additional benefits.

School board president Kathleen Hohenadel said the board is interviewing
candidates for Klawitter's replacement. "We hope to narrow down (our choice) by
the end of the month."

Klawitter expects to se a new superintendent installed full time by August.

In his seven years as superintendent, Hohenadel said Klawitter "reached out to
the community and created a strong bond between the school board and the
community."

"I'm very proud of what has been accomplished," Klawitter said of his service to
the district. He said several improvements over years included implementation of
full-day kindergarten, increases in remediation and tutoring, certified reading
specialists for grades K-8, revitalization of the stadium and the recent
completion of a three-year strategic plan.

Klawitter said his retirement comes at a good time, both personally and for the
school district. With a solid teachers' contract and the start of a new
strategic plan, it is the right time to involve a new person.

The board also:

Postponed the decision to contract Portnoff Law Associates of Wynnewood as the
district's delinquent tax collector.

In considering Portnoff, Columbia would follow many other districts throughout
the state who are breaking with tradition.

Historically, the county collects delinquent taxes which are then passed on to
their respective school districts, after charging districts a 5 percent service
fee.

"The county is not historically good at collecting (in a timely fashion),"
district finance chair Tom Strickler said Sunday.

Other districts using Portnoff have seen a collection rate of 70 to 75 percent
in the first three months, Strickler said. In addition, Portnoff does not charge
the school district a 5 percent fee like the county. Instead, all fees are paid
by the delinquent taxpayers.

By switching to Portnoff, Strickler hopes to bring the district's total real
estate tax collection rate from 90 percent up to 95 percent, cutting their
delinquent tax in half.

District solicitor Donald Nikolaus pointed out there is not a lot of clarity in
the law when it comes to using private firms to collect delinquent taxes. It is
possible the courts may, in time, rule against the practice. In this case, the
district could be sued by the county.

Nikolaus also cautioned that, with changes in the way property would be
dispersed with the private firm, the district could end up owning real estate.

Strickler said several districts in the state, including Penn Manor, have used
Portnoff and other private firms, for several years with good results. Another
benefit, he said, is Portnoff would work with delinquent taxpayers on an
individual basis to work out payment plans when possible.

Announced graduation ceremonies for the Class of 2006 will be held Thursday 1 at
7 p.m. in Crimson Tide stadium. In case of rain the ceremony will be moved into
the high school auditorium.

The board accepted the resignation of board member Jeanette Sherk effective June
2. Interviews for her replacement will be held June 8. Columbia residents over
the age of 18 interested in the position should contact either Klawitter or
Hohenadel in writing by Thursday at 200 N 5th St., Columbia, 17512.

Delinquent taxes put 4, 800 parcels up for auction

BYLINE: The Horry Independent staff

LENGTH: 532  words


Approximately 1, 000 real estate properties and mobile homes could be up for
auction when Horry County holds its annual delinquent tax sale Nov. 1.

According to delinquent tax manager Crystal Montgomery of the Horry County
Treasurer's Office, 2009 taxes had not been paid on 4, 800 properties as of
Monday morning. However, the number of available properties is expected to
decrease significantly between now and Nov. 1.

"We're hoping it will be under 1, 000 by the time the tax sale gets here, and it
usually is, " Montgomery said. "We sold 800 properties last year."

Of the 800 properties sold at this past year's tax sale, a little over 50
percent has been redeemed by the owners.

"They still have until December 7 to redeem, " Montgomery said. "They still have
a couple more months."

Having 4, 800 delinquent tax properties is not unusual in the weeks leading up
to the sale, according to Montgomery who said many of the property owners wait
until shortly before the sale to come in and pay up.

"It's about normal for the past couple of years, " she said. "We expect it to
drop a lot."

Although it is not required, Montgomery urges people who want to participate in
the auction to register and fill out a bidder's application prior to Nov. 1,
when the auction will be held in Conference Room B of the administration
building at the Horry County Government & Justice Center. Participants may also
register the day of the sale beginning at 8 a.m.

Bidders are not allowed to participate in the sale until they have completed the
registration process and received a Didder's number.

To fill out a bidder's application or to see a list of available properties, go
to www.horrycounty.org and click on delinquent tax department. A copy of the
list of properties is also available in the treasurer's office for $20. The list
of all delinquent properties will be advertised in local newspapers including
The Horry Independent, The Carolina Forest Chronicle and The Loris Scene Oct.
14, 21 and 28. Not all advertised properties will be sold.

There is no charge to participate in the auction, Montgomery said, but
successful bidders will be required to pay the bid in full by 5 p.m. the day of
the sale. The money will hold the property for the winning bidder for a year,
during which time the owner or mortgage company can reclaim the property by
paying the taxes plus interest. If the owner reclaims the property, the bidder
receives a refund with interest.

The amount of interest is 3 percent, if the property is reclaimed within the
first three months, 6 percent for the second quarter, 9 percent for the third
quarter and 12 percent for the final quarter.

"If no one comes forward for a year and a day from the sale, the bidder will get
a tax deed, " Montgomery said.

The 2009 taxes were considered delinquent on March 17 and delinquent tax notices
were mailed April 1. Certified notices were mailed on delinquent real estate and
mobile homes 30 days after the delinquent notices went out. Levy notices were
then posted on the delinquent real estate and mobile homes.

The Nov. 1 tax sale will begin at 10 a.m. and continue until it is completed or
4 p.m. If necessary, the sale will resume at 9 a.m. on Nov. 2.

Punishing the corporate delinquents

LENGTH: 912 words

DATELINE: Bangladesh


Bangladesh, Sept. 18 -- Proper laws and their implementation are inextricably
linked with good corporate governance. Crimes are as old as the human beings
are. There are crimes, so there are also punishment.

The London Stock Exchange went into operation in the 17th century. In the 18th
century it witnessed a gargantuan share scam known as the South Sea Bubble. A
parliamentary committee looked into the matter. The incident took place in 1720.
The then British Finance Minister (official designation-chancellor of the
exchequer) was found guilty and committed to the Tower for most notorious,
dangerous and infamous corruption.

In India, the Mumbai share scam took place in 1992 and Harshad Mehta, the
villain, was arrested and put to jail. He could not come out alive from
incarceration.

In 2001, the USA witnessed a macabre corporate disaster in addition to the Twin
Tower tragedy in New York City. Enron and a few other companies collapsed. The
US government immediately went into action. Anderson, one of the world's five
biggest audit firms, was shut down for playing a villain in the scandal. A lot
of corporate mandarins were arrested and one executive committed suicide. The
age-old monopoly of chartered accountants (CAs) as the sole authority for
handling corporate audit reports was clipped and a separate accountant body was
set up for publicly-traded companies. The body was known as the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB).

The company board, hitherto consisted of sponsors-primary share holders-was
compelled to include directors. Now every public limited company will have to
accept two or three members as directors of the board and they are known as
independent directors. They will have no financial stake in the company in any
form. This concept, first introduced in the USA, has been accepted in all
countries around the globe. Within a decade the US Congress has passed two acts
known as Sarbanes-Oxley Act and Dodd Franck Act. The first one was to prune the
wings of a publicly-traded company that hitherto had seen abnormal growth
because of the unfettered freedom in the market economy. Objectives of the Dodd
Frank Act are to promote financial stability in the US by improving
accountability and transparency in the financial system to help the too big stem
failure and protect the American taxpayers by ending bailouts to protect
consumers from abusive financial practices.

During the last global economic depression a large number of public limited
companies in the developed world, more prominently in the USA, had to be bailed
out or rescued by the government belying the views of the orthodox protagonists
of the market that it would take care of itself and no government intervention
would be necessary.

Bernard Madoff, a member of the Wall Street, was incarcerated for his alleged
crimes in the share trade.

This litany of corporate misdeeds has been presented only to emphasise that
corporate delinquent cannot be allowed to go unpunished.

The fledgling share market of Bangladesh experienced two great share scams
within less than two decades. In both cases enquiries were duly made. Concerned
committees submitted comprehensive reports and suggested measures to be taken.
The most interesting thing is that the same faces were among the delinquents in
the two scams.

Bangladesh never lacked response from investors both in primary and secondary
markets. For the primary market, Bangladesh is a gold mine. Any initial public
offering (IPO), even with minimum credibility, has been oversubscribed several
times. A section of prospective sponsors are not taking this positively, rather
they have tried to deceive and exploit the people in different ways. Because of
this criminal psyche the two scams took place.

The London-based The Economist published a report on the latest scam in the
Bangladesh stock markets. It was captioned Slaughter of the Innocent. The
caption of the 1996 share market scam was repeated in 2009-2010. In spite of
mentioning specifically the names of the delinquents, the Bangladesh Securities
and Exchange Commission (BSEC) did not take any action.

The BSEC or the government may claim that it has been successful in
demutualising the local bourses. It is never a panacea for all the ills in the
share market. Definitely it will help in creating a dynamic administration in
the stock exchange. But in the event of any share market scam a section of share
brokers, share traders and a group of sponsors form an unholy alliance and
create an artificial bull market to allure and mislead the innocent investors.
Virtually these innocent investors are allured into the buying spree and
trapped. The members of the unholy alliance unload their shares, book the
profits and siphon them away.

Since the delinquents have not been tried and punished, there may be repetition
of the same in future. It has already been reported in the media that a section
of rogue share traders was trying to contact different probable IPO issuance
companies with some ulterior motives.

The corporate delinquents must be brought to justice. Because of the
demutualisation of bourses there will not be any impediment to taking legal
action unlike that in the past. Now, it is the will of the BSEC that matters.

WESTPARK MAINTENANCE ASSOCIATION under said Notice of Delinquent Assessment
heretofore executed and delivered to the undersigned a written Declaration of
Default and Demand for Sale, and a written Notice of Default and Election to
Sell. The undersigned caused said Notice of Default and Election to Sell to be
recorded in the county where the real property is located and more than three
months have elapsed since such recordation. NOTICE TO POTENTIAL BIDDERS: If you
are considering bidding on this property lien, you should understand that there
are risks involved in bidding at a trustee auction. You will be bidding on a
lien, not on the property itself. Placing the highest bid at a trustee auction
does not automatically entitle you to free and clear ownership of the property.
You should also be aware that the lien being auctioned off may be a junior lien.
If you are the highest bidder at the auction, you are or may be responsible for
paying off all liens senior to the lien being auctioned off, before you can
receive clear title to the property. You are encouraged to investigate the
existence, priority, and size of outstanding liens that may exist on this
property by contacting the county recorder's office or a title insurance
company, either of which may charge you a fee for this information. If you
consult either of these resources, you should be aware that the same lender may
hold more than one mortgage or deed of trust on the property. NOTICE TO PROPERTY
OWNER: The sale date shown on this notice of sale may be postponed one or more
times by the mortgagee, beneficiary, trustee, or a court, pursuant to Section
2924g of the California Civil Code. The law requires that information about
trustee sale postponements be made available to you and to the public, as a
courtesy to those not present at the sale. If you wish to learn whether your
sale date has been postponed, and, if applicable, the rescheduled time and date
for the sale of this property, you may call FOR SALE INFORMATION, PLEASE CALL
(855)986-9342, or visit this Internet Web site www.superiordefault.com  using
the file number assigned to this case 2015-1005 . Information about
postponements that are very short in duration or that occur close in time to the
scheduled sale may not immediately be reflected in the telephone information or
on the Internet Web site. The best way to verify postponement information is to
attend the scheduled sale. THE PROPERTY IS BEING SOLD SUBJECT TO THE NINETY DAY
RIGHT OF REDEMPTION CONTAINED IN CIVIL CODE SECTION 5715(b). PLEASE NOTE THAT WE
ARE A DEBT COLLECTOR AND ARE ATTEMPTING TO COLLECT A DEBT AND ANY INFORMATION WE
OBTAIN WILL BE USED FOR THAT PURPOSE. Date: 10/03/2016. S.B.S LIEN SERVICES,

existence, priority, and size of outstanding liens that may exist on this

paying off all liens senior to the lien being auctioned off, before you can
receive clear title to the property. You are encouraged to investigate the
existence, priority, and size of outstanding liens that may exist on this

postponements that are very short in duration or that occur close in time to the
scheduled sale may not immediately be reflected in the telephone information or
on the Internet Web site. The best way to verify postponement information is to
attend the scheduled sale. THE PROPERTY IS BEING SOLD SUBJECT TO THE NINETY DAY
RIGHT OF REDEMPTION CONTAINED IN CIVIL CODE SECTION 5715(b). PLEASE NOTE THAT WE

executed and delivered to the undersigned a written Declaration of Default and
Demand for Sale, and a written Notice of Default and Election to Sell. The
undersigned caused said Notice of Default and Election to Sell to be recorded in

considering bidding on this property lien, you should understand that there are
risks involved in bidding at a trustee auction. You will be bidding on a lien,
not on the property itself. Placing the highest bid at a trustee auction does

should also be aware that the lien being auctioned off may be a junior lien. If
you are the highest bidder at the auction, you are or may be responsible for
paying off all liens senior to the lien being auctioned off, before you can
receive clear title to the property. You are encouraged to investigate the
existence, priority, and size of outstanding liens that may exist on this
property by contacting the county recorder's office or a title insurance
company, either of which may charge you a fee for this information. If you
consult either of these resources, you should be aware that the same lender may
hold more than one mortgage or deed of trust on the property. NOTICE TO PROPERTY
OWNER: The sale date shown on this notice of sale may be postponed one or more
times by the mortgagee, beneficiary, trustee, or a court, pursuant to Section
2924g of the California Civil Code. The law requires that information about
trustee sale postponements be made available to you and to the public, as a
courtesy to those not present at the sale. If you wish to learn whether your
sale date has been postponed, and, if applicable, the rescheduled time and date
for the sale of this property, you may call FOR SALE INFORMATION, PLEASE CALL
(855)986-9342, or visit this Internet Web site www.superiordefault.com  using
the file number assigned to this case 2016-1234 . Information about
postponements that are very short in duration or that occur close in time to the
scheduled sale may not immediately be reflected in the telephone information or
on the Internet Web site. The best way to verify postponement information is to
attend the scheduled sale. THE PROPERTY IS BEING SOLD SUBJECT TO THE NINETY DAY
RIGHT OF REDEMPTION CONTAINED IN CIVIL CODE SECTION 5715(b). PLEASE NOTE THAT WE

you are the highest bidder at the auction, you are or may be responsible for
paying off all liens senior to the lien being auctioned off, before you can
receive clear title to the property. You are encouraged to investigate the
existence, priority, and size of outstanding liens that may exist on this

company, either of which may charge you a fee for this information. If you
consult either of these resources, you should be aware that the same lender may
hold more than one mortgage or deed of trust on the property. NOTICE TO PROPERTY

courtesy to those not present at the sale. If you wish to learn whether your
sale date has been postponed, and, if applicable, the rescheduled time and date
for the sale of this property, you may call FOR SALE INFORMATION, PLEASE CALL

postponements that are very short in duration or that occur close in time to the
scheduled sale may not immediately be reflected in the telephone information or
on the Internet Web site. The best way to verify postponement information is to
attend the scheduled sale. THE PROPERTY IS BEING SOLD SUBJECT TO THE NINETY DAY
RIGHT OF REDEMPTION CONTAINED IN CIVIL CODE SECTION 5715(b). PLEASE NOTE THAT WE

paying off all liens senior to the lien being auctioned off, before you can
receive clear title to the property. You are encouraged to investigate the
existence, priority, and size of outstanding liens that may exist on this

Warren County LDC taking action on delinquent loans

BYLINE: Blake Jones, The Post-Star, Glens Falls, N.Y.

SECTION: BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS

LENGTH: 304 words


June 01--Warren County Local Development Corp.

Meeting

--LDC meeting, Thursday morning

Top story

--Jennifer Switzer, the LDC's chief financial officer, provided an update on the
group's loan portfolio. There are 22 loans, five of which are delinquent. The
LDC is taking action on two of the delinquent loans. Northeast Excavating owes
about $42,000, more than it borrowed because it has been making partial payments
and accruing penalties. The LDC plans to meet with the company to discuss the
loan terms. Rosy Blues Flowers in Lake Luzerne is also in default and has been
unresponsive to emails, letters and phone calls. Switzer said the next step is
taking legal action. The business owes about $24,000.

Other news

--Vicki Pratt Gerbino, the LDC's chief executive officer, asked the board to
meet with officials from the New York Business Development Corp., which manages
small-business revolving loan funds. Pratt Gerbino said funds like the LDC's are
notoriously time-consuming and risky, which makes it difficult to attract bank
partners. She said NYBDC is successful in recruiting banks because of its
expertise and many partnerships. She said she is working to bring the NYBDC to
the area to talk with local officials about its approach.

--The board reviewed bids submitted for legal work with loan closings. The board
opted to pursue discussions with McPhillips, Fitzgerald and Cullum in Glens
Falls about a one-year contract with options for renewal.

--The board authorized the Planning Department to use $42,000 in an LDC housing
account at its discretion for housing programs, including for matching funds to
accompany state grant applications.

Next meeting

--Not yet scheduled.

Attorney Chester pays delinquent county taxes

BYLINE: Bob Stuart, The News Virginian, Waynesboro, Va.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 445 words


Feb. 28--Churchville attorney Francis Chester paid his delinquent Augusta County
property taxes Friday and criticized the county treasurer for commenting about
the delinquency a day earlier.

The attorney is leading a petition drive against the Augusta County
reassessment, and has said he will sue if the reasssessment is not set aside by
county supervisors.

Chester paid his nearly $2,900 delinquent real estate and personal property tax
bill early Friday afternoon, and also paid his business license tax.

In addition to his law practice, Chester owns a sheep operation and wool mill.

Prior to paying his taxes, Chester said Treasurer Richard Homes made statements
and took actions "that were unethical, immoral and unprofessional. They should
never be tolerated and are a basis for removal from office."

Chester maintains he is attempting to provide a proper basis for taxes in the
community that is fair and ethical for all.

Homes commented Thursday when confirming Chester's delinquent taxes that he is
concerned about all delinquencies.

On Friday, Homes said he was only responding to a public information request
from media and did not initiate the information about Chester.

"Mr. Chester has paid his taxes and has threatened me to make a public apology
for my comments," Homes said. "He mentioned he would get a petition to have me
removed from office or would see me in court."

Homes said he was not issuing an apology and he had checked on the matter with
Augusta County Attorney Patrick Morgan.

Meanwhile, Chester has reached a compromise with the Augusta County Library and
its branches regarding his petition drive.

The library's executive director, Diantha McCauley, said a flier announcing the
March 11 board of supervisors meeting and the petitions that will be presented
is posted on the library's bulletin board and will also be displayed at its
Middlebrook and Churchville branches.

McCauley said the flier also discloses how to get in touch with Chester and
obtain petitions.

The library had earlier refused to allow the actual petitions to be displayed
inside the library, citing a policy about petitions.

Chester said he was happy with the compromise.

"I have no beef with the library," he said. "They do an absolutely wonderful
job."

taxes;
More than 1,700 behind on tax bills for 2015

BYLINE: NC Ingram Hunter; StarNews Staff

SECTION: 1,A; GateHouse Media GM9; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 443 words


NEW HANOVER COUNTY   As 2016 property tax bills begin to trickle into mailboxes
across the county, some residents are still skirting their bills from last year.

More than 1,700 property owners have yet to pay taxes totaling $941,438 for the
2015 tax year, incoming tax administrator Allison Snell said Monday. The
holdouts represent nearly half of the 3,635 property owners who owed nearly $4
million in delinquent 2015 taxes as of March 21.

Snell, who is replacing retiring administrator Roger Kelley, said the delinquent
taxes are in line with the amount generally due at this time each year.

When you look at the grand scale at what we do send out, this is very small,
said Snell, who will officially take the reins Thursday.  It is manageable. The
collectors will go out and follow up.

Tax bills typically go out in late August and are due in September. But Snell

See taxes,  A5

said most people don t understand that the payment grace period stretches
through January without penalty.

If not paid by the January cutoff, however, delinquent taxes accrue interest at
a rate of 2 percent for the first month and 0.75 percent per month thereafter.

The largest outstanding bill from 2015   $13,707   is levied on $3.6 million
property co-owned by the county at 3990 Independence Blvd.

Originally willed to the county eight years ago by the late Flossie Viola Bryan,
the donation was contested by her heirs, who went on to assume ownership of a
third of the property that is taxable. The county s portion is tax exempt.

North Front LLC owes the only other five-figure bill   $12,692   for a vacant
building at 255 N. Front St.

Last year s tax bills were the second to make a four-installment repayment plan
available to residents   a program Snell attributes to a decline in delinquent
taxpayers.

She also said it also offers relief for taxpayers nervous about paying a lump
sum at once. Repayment options, however, become more limited for taxpayers who
fall into delinquency. But they should not feel out of options.

If they are delinquent, we will offer them a payment plan,  she said.  We will
work with anybody we can, as long as they are willing to work with us.

The 2016 tax bills are due Sept. 1, but can be paid through Jan. 5 without
penalty.

They are the first to reflect a 4.9-cent property tax increase passed in June by
the Board of Commissioners to cover voter-approved debt.

State lists deadbeat firms

BYLINE: Mike Wereschagin

LENGTH: 353 words


The Pennsylvania Department of Revenue added 66 businesses to its list of tax
delinquents, including a Pittsburgh charity the state said owes about $95,000 in
payroll taxes.

Operation Nehemiah, an East Hills-based group that provides development and
counseling services, has made arrangements to pay the taxes, said Constance
Balthrop, the group's CEO.

Operation Nehemiah, which helped broker the deal earlier this year to bring a
Wal-Mart store to the former East Hills Shopping Center site, also had to pay
about $300,000 in back taxes to the Internal Revenue Service, according to court
documents. It has paid almost $1,400 in penalties and interest on late Allegheny
County property taxes since 2004, according to county records. This year, the
group owes the county almost $500 in penalties and interest.

"Thankfully, we are on top of that," Balthrop said. "We should be current with
everything by the end of this month."

The Revenue Department's delinquent list includes the names of 282 businesses
that it says owe the state sales or payroll taxes. The amounts owed by each
company range from more than $216,000 for Petersburg, Va.-based Alrod
Enterprises Inc., to about $5,100 for Seven Star Tropical Fish Inc. in
Philadelphia. Operation Nehemiah ranks 14th on the list.

Businesses aren't added to the list until a tax lien has been filed in court and
the business has been told it's being added to the list.

Many companies pay up to keep their names off the list. Delinquent taxpayers
have paid $30.5 million and taken advantage of deferred payment plans for
another $19.5 million in back taxes, according to the Revenue Department. More
than 180 of the 399 businesses that were posted on the list since it appeared in
April 2006 were removed after paying.

"It is a successful tool in collecting unpaid taxes," said Stephanie Weyant, a
department spokeswoman. "We get a lot of compliance before people appear on the
list."

Nineteen companies in Allegheny County owe nearly $520,000, according to the
department's data. At least 20 other states, including Maryland, New Jersey and
Virginia, use similar lists.

County releases list of biggest tax scofflaws

BYLINE: BILLY WOLFE, DAILY MAIL STAFF

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. P4C

LENGTH: 436 words


Kanawha County tax officials have released their annual list of the biggest
delinquent tax accounts for the year, and say lawsuits will be filed against
those that are not paid soon.

The delinquent taxes for this year total $525,148.45, a marked decrease from
last year's delinquent accounts. Twenty different corporations and individuals
made the list last year, owing a combined total of about $2.2 million.

"The good news is, it's down from past years," Kanawha Commission President Kent
Carper said.

He referred to those owing taxes as "scofflaws," and said they cause higher
taxes for law-abiding citizens.

"I certainly understand people who are having trouble paying their bills right
now, but these, generally, are people we've looked at who really do have the
ability to pay, but who would rather stall it and pay a small penalty," he said.
"That's not right."

The largest of the unpaid bills belong to three different synthetic fuel
companies that appear to operate out of the same location.

New River Synfuel LLC, Imperial Synfuel LLC and Calla Synfuel LLC owe a combined
total of nearly $175,000 in unpaid taxes. The three companies share a
Massachusetts address, according to records kept by the Secretary of State's
office.

The largest unpaid bill for a single entity belongs to Trafalgor LTD. The
company still owes $173,687.38, according to the list.

Carper said some companies usually pay up once the list is reported by local
news media, but the county usually has to take some companies to court.

"It's been necessary ever since I've been here," he said. "But once the
scofflaws find out you mean business, it brings them around and sends the
message to those who might want to go down the same route," he said.

At least two of the companies have gone out of business, but tax officials said
they plan to file against parent companies, if possible.

Steve and Barry's of WV LLC, a discount clothing store that went out of business
at the Charleston Town Center Mall in late 2008, owes nearly $96,000. Value City
Department Store, another defunct company, still owes about $25,000.

Chief Tax Deputy Allen Bleigh said letters are being drafted to inform those
responsible that they need to pay up soon.

Other companies and individuals on the list this year include:

-WV Laser Eye Center LLC ($18,101.33)

-Janice Whitman and John Bukani ($9,556.32)

-Central Vending Inc. ($7,970.07)

-West End Trax Inc. ($5,668.19)

-Jennifer L. Watkins ($5,508.17)

-Dorothy Becker ($3,819.42)

-Big Chimney Modern Development Center Inc. ($3,137.37)

-Jim Hanson ($1,931.92)

Surplus property auction slated  ;
 County selling 96 tax delinquent parcels

BYLINE: FRANK FUHRIG STAFF WRITER

SECTION: CITY/STATE; Pg. 6

LENGTH: 472 words


Sangamon County will hold its second-ever public auction of surplus property
next month.

The first such auction in October netted $154,801. More than 200 parcels with
taxes delinquent since at least 1995 were placed on the block and 127 sold.

The second auction, to be held at 7 p.m. Feb. 20 at the Prairie Capital
Convention Center, will include 96 parcels, plus underground coal rights for
five additional properties.

Sale catalogs are available at the Sangamon County treasurer's office, 200 S.
Ninth St. For more information, contact Joseph E. Meyer & Associates at (800)
248-2850.

Most of the parcels in the new action are delinquent on 1996 property taxes,
which were payable in 1997. The sale also includes some leftover properties that
did not sell the first time around. The minimum bid for parcels is $350. At the
previous auction, the average sale price was $1,219.

"As auctions go on, we find more interest  .. . and generally we find higher
prices," said Joseph Meyer, whose Edwardsville firm serves as the county's
delinquent tax agent. "We start seeing more bidders, and more bidders produces
higher bids."

The majority of the parcels are in Capital Township within Springfield.

Unlike the first auction in October, there are no large-acreage properties.
Three parcels are more than one acre, the largest measuring 2.5 acres near the
intersection of Harrison Avenue and Illinois 4 in Auburn Township.

The smallest parcels cover less than 250 square feet and sometimes form tiny
wedges or strips between properties. Some are remnants in subdivisions that were
never sold to homeowners and later abandoned by developers.

Many of those parcels were included in the first auction; some were bought by
adjoining land owners, while others went unsold and will be on the block again.

"A lot of the little slivers and small slips were delinquent for years and
years," said Meyer. "As the auctions go on, I would anticipate fewer items but
more desirable items."

The February sale has a higher percentage of full-size vacant lots.

The auction will include a lot on Melody Lane that has part of a two-car garage,
another with a one-car garage attached to the adjoining lot at 119 Colby Ave.,
and a second Colby Avenue parcel that underlies part of a one-story house.

A parcel at 1129 S. Ninth St. has part of a commercial building, and a lot at
2223-2225 Capitol Ave. includes a small part of a two-story house.

A third Sangamon County public auction of surplus property will be held July 11,
including properties delinquent on 1997 taxes. Sales will be held annually
thereafter.

Similar auctions are scheduled for Aug. 15 in Macon County and Sept. 19 in
Macoupin County.

Delinquent tax program auctions by sealed bid will be June 13 in Brown County,
June 18 in Mason County, Aug. 14 in Logan County and Sept. 5 in Greene County.

Training school numbers decline;
Changes make it more difficult to send youths to centers

BYLINE: John Stevenson jstevenson@heraldsun.com

SECTION: FRONT; Pg. A1

LENGTH: 721 words


DURHAM -- Juvenile-justice officials in Durham have what looks at first glance
like good news, but there aren't any cork-popping celebrations just yet.

The news is statistical in nature.

There has been a drastic decrease in the number of young delinquents going from
the Bull City to the state's youth development centers -- facilities once known
as training schools or reformatories.

A decade ago, in the mid- to late 1990s, some 30 to 40 Durham children a year
were being packed off to such facilities.

In 2007, that number dropped to 17.

But there is a reason officials aren't beating the celebratory drums.

They haven't been able to correlate plummeting development-center commitments to
an actual decline in juvenile crime. Fewer commitments may be attributable
instead to changes in the North Carolina juvenile code -- changes that make it
more difficult for judges to institutionalize young delinquents.

"The requirements for training school eligibility are much stricter now," said
District Judge Marcia Morey, who is in a position to know.

Morey was a juvenile-court prosecutor in Durham from 1996 to 1998, when she was
hand-picked by then-Gov. Jim Hunt to help revise the juvenile code.

Before the revision, youths were sent to development centers even for
misdemeanor crimes, according to Morey. Now, only violent and repeat offenders
are eligible, she said.

A 2006 annual report from the N.C. Department of Juvenile Justice put the "
delinquent" rate in Durham County at 25.50 per 1,000 for youths between the ages
of 6 and 15.

Durham is in the central reporting area of the state.

The highest delinquent rate for the area was 54.32 in Brunswick County. The
lowest was 16.96 in Chatham County. Wake, Orange and Person counties reported
rates of 28.14, 27.17 and 29.40, respectively.

The Durham rate translates to an average of about 60 juvenile-court cases
weekly.

Since development-center commitments no longer are as available to judges as
they once were, delinquent juveniles must be placed under supervision within the
community. Nightly curfews, mentoring programs, substance-abuse treatment,
psychological counseling and other options are used.

Roughly 250 Bull City youths are under scrutiny at any given time.

"Durham has done a good job in providing better supervision," Morey said. "It's
more intensive than it used to be. We can keep a better watch on juveniles now.
When you send them to training school, you know they're always coming back. We
believe you can better treat and rehabilitate them in the community."

In addition, parenting classes are offered for the mothers and fathers of
delinquent young people.

But Morey and other officials are worried about recently introduced legislation
that -- if passed -- would drastically pare the state's budget for such
programs, stripping Durham alone of some $500,000.

"If that money is cut, we're going to be in a dire situation," said Morey. "The
mere prospect is having a chilling effect. Some people who work with these
programs are already looking for other jobs because they aren't sure they'll be
employed after June 30."

Donald Pinchback, Durham's chief juvenile court counselor, shares the concern.

"My counselors are pretty much overworked now," he said. "If this funding
disappears, we're going to be in a tight situation. We could lose life-skills
training that is needed to give our young people a work ethic. We have children
parenting children out here. They desperately need this training."

Meanwhile, Pinchback noted that a 16-year-old boy had the dubious distinction of
becoming the last Durham youth committed to a development center in 2007. He
received his marching orders on the Friday before Christmas.

"This kid was given a lot of chances," Pinchback said. "He just wouldn't do what
he was told. He was continuing to do his thing and not taking advantage of our
coaching and other programs."

After being convicted of one felony, the teen picked up another felony charge
while on probation, according to Pinchback.

The boy was sent away by District Judge Jim Hill, who said in an interview that,
based on his experience, the frequency of extreme violence among Durham youths
is declining, while gang involvement is spiraling upward.

Hill said he recently confiscated a red arm band from a juvenile who proudly
flaunted it in court as a symbol of gang membership.

Bill seeks to toughen delinquent parent law;
It would expand the license revocation law to include snowmobiles and more.

BYLINE: Staff Writer

SECTION: LOCAL & STATE; Pg. B1

LENGTH: 584 words

DATELINE: AUGUSTA


State Sen. John Martin, D-Eagle Lake, wants the state to expand its power to
revoke the licenses of parents who fail to pay child support.

The law, which currently applies to driving, professional, hunting and fishing
licenses, should be amended to include snowmobiles, all-terrain vehicles and
extra cars, Martin said.

He said he knows of a man in northern Maine who began tooling around town on an
all-terrain vehicle after he lost his driver's license for ignoring
court-ordered child-support payments.

Martin wants the Legislature to get even tougher by barring parents who don't
pay child support from registering more than one motor vehicle, as well as any
ATVs or snowmobiles.

He said his bill would not go after delinquents who have only one car or truck,
because other family members who are blameless may need that lone vehicle to get
around.

Martin sees his proposal as a logical extension of the license-revocation law
because it would give the state one more tool to force delinquent parents to
care for their children, and that would help the state control welfare costs.

But the bill has come under attack from the Secretary of State's Office, which
includes the Bureau of Motor Vehicles. Officials there believe Mainers who
comply with motor-vehicle laws should be allowed to register their vehicles,
regardless of their child-support status, said spokesman Don Cookson.

In the last fiscal year, the state revoked or threatened to revoke 583
professional licenses and 3,538 driver's licenses for nonpayment of child
support, said Barbara Van Burgel of the state Department of Health and Human
Services.

That agency is collecting or trying to collect child support in 57,000 cases.
Thousands more are still working their way through the courts.

Van Burgel said 61 percent of the affected professional-license holders have
since made arrangements to pay up. So have 59 percent of the people who lost
their driver's licenses last year or were threatened with revocation.

Martin's bill has the support of House Majority Whip Sean Faircloth, D-Bangor,
who championed passage of the license-revocation law more than a decade ago. He
said linking vehicle registrations to child-support payments is ''the right
thing to do,'' to protect children and safeguard the welfare budget.

Faircloth said lawmakers may be receptive to the proposal because the state has
had the power to revoke licenses for many years, so ''people are more used to
the idea'' of allowing the state to threaten delinquent parents with
repercussions.

''I think it's a positive idea,'' he said.

Senate Minority Leader Carol Weston, R-Montville, has not taken a position on
the bill. But she wonders whether scofflaws who already ignore the loss of their
licenses to drive, work, hunt or fish are so indifferent that they also will
ignore threats aimed at their ATVs or snowmobiles.

''We all want these dads or moms to support their kids,'' Weston said. But she
wondered how far the state would be willing to go in strengthening the law if
the parents continue to ignore their responsibility.

Delinquent parents sometimes may have ''an extenuating circumstance'' that makes
them unable or unwilling to pay child support, Weston said, such as a low-paying
job or knowledge that the custodial parent is irresponsible.

Van Burgel said her department has taken no position on the bill, but it will
use any added enforcement tools that the Legislature may provide.

MAN'S DELINQUENT PROPERTY TAXES ARE SNAPPED UP BEFORE OFFICIAL SALE

BYLINE: Jo; Mannies; Post-Dispatch Political Correspondent

SECTION: METRO, Pg. C4

LENGTH: 238 words


After his last-ditch effort to pay his delinquent property taxes, Larry Shelton
of Cahokia found out that his taxes aren't included in this week's tax sale in
St. Clair County.

That's because a tax-buyer bought them before the sale.

"Now I owe him $ 1,600. I don't have $ 1,600," Shelton said Tuesday.

The tax-buyer, Dennis Ballinger of Decatur, last year had purchased Shelton's
delinquent 1995 property taxes. Under Illinois law, that purchase allowed
Ballinger to pay Shelton's subsequent delinquent property taxes without his
knowledge.

Shelton, a former carpenter studying to be a paralegal, caused a stir Monday
when he showed up at the County Jail, where the tax sale was under way. Shelton
had brought cash to pay off his delinquent 1996 taxes of $ 748.02.

After he was told it was too late to pay, Shelton went to the office of county
state's attorney Robert B. Haida to complain. There, the staff searched county
property records and discovered that Ballinger had paid the property taxes on
Nov. 4.

Shelton asserted Tuesday that it was unfair that he was not notified. "I should
have the first right to pay, not the second right," Shelton said.

Ballinger replied: "He did have the first right, and he didn't pay. They were
delinquent." Ballinger said he paid the taxes to protect his investment, should
Shelton lose title to the property for failing to repay Ballinger within three
years.

Potential post office buyer owes thousands to city in unpaid fees

BYLINE: Emily Opilo, York Daily Record, Pa.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 646 words


May 25--YORK, Pa. -- The York County real estate investor who expects to buy the
historic downtown post office owes the city nearly $100,000 in delinquent sewer
and trash bills.

Themi Sacarellos, who does business as MOLT LLC, said this week that he was the
selected bidder for the more than 100-year-old building on South George Street.
The U.S. Postal Service has not confirmed that.

Two months ago, MOLT LLC was among the property owners that were highlighted by
York Business Administrator Michael O'Rourke because they owed large amounts in
delinquent sewer and trash fees. According to a list released at that time, MOLT
LLC owed back fees on 37 properties in the city, totaling $58,234 for sewer and
$39,154 for trash.

City officials released the names of the most delinquent customers in an effort
to collect about $14 million that is owed to the city in unpaid fees. Beginning
in June, the city will, for the first time, cut off water service to those who
haven't paid or at least established a payment plan.

O'Rourke said in an email Thursday that MOLT LLC had arranged a payment plan
with the city for sewer delinquencies, but the company will be considered
delinquent until the full amount has been paid off, he said.

Several attempts to reach Sacarellos Thursday were unsuccessful.

Sacarellos -- who is also the co-owner of Round The Clock Diner -- owns dozens
of properties in York County. Deeds for the various holdings list him as a
managing member for MOLT LLC, a company based in the 900 block of Heritage Hills
Drive in York Township.

York City Council members were alerted to the connection between the impending
post office sale and the delinquencies in an email from a city resident sent
Wednesday night.

York Mayor Kim Bracey responded to the email Thursday morning stating that the
city was aware that the potential buyer owed the delinquent fees, according to
city council president Carol Hill-Evans and city resident Craig Smith, who
received the e-mail. Bracey urged residents to contact U.S. Rep. Todd Platts,
R-York County, about the sale because it will ultimately be a federal issue.

In 2011, the U.S. Postal Service announced that it would try to sell the stately
neoclassical building in the 200 block of South George Street in hopes of
renting a smaller, more manageable space in York's downtown. On Wednesday, U.S.
Postal Service Spokesman Raymond V. Daiutolo Sr. wouldn't confirm the sale of
the property. Nothing is official until all paperwork and contracts have been
signed, he said.

Sacarellos told the York Daily Record Wednesday that he was unsure what his
plans were for the old post office, but noted that it would be suited for
restaurants and offices.

Kevin Schreiber, city director of economic and community development, said
Thursday that the sale of the building does not appear to be complete. The post
office has not confirmed anything, he said.

"Am I concerned? Yes," Schreiber said. "But I don't think it's done."

The city has been in touch with Platts, and at the end of the day, it's a
federal government decision, Schreiber said. Platts was not immediately
available for comment Thursday night.

The city would like to see legislation barring the federal government from
selling buildings to buyers who are not in good standing with local
municipalities, Schreiber said.

"All we can do it make sure they're informed," he said.

Story so far

The building: In 2011, the U.S. Postal Service put the property on the market,
saying it was too expensive to maintain.

The potential buyer: Themi Sacarellos, doing business as Molt LLC, said he was
the selected bidder on the building.

"I've been chasing that property for three years," he said Wednesday. "That's
the only building that looks like that in the whole city."

BRIEF: N.C. to help delinquent taxpayers pay off debts

BYLINE: The Fayetteville Observer, N.C.

SECTION: BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS

LENGTH: 187 words


Jan. 18--The N.C. Department of Revenue has launched a temporary program to help
delinquent taxpayers pay off their accrued state tax debt.

The Individual Income Tax Debt Payment Program is aimed at individual taxpayers
who properly filed state tax returns in previous years but who still owe the
state money.

Those numbers have grown since the economic downturn, said Revenue Department
spokeswoman Beth Stevenson.

The program will help participating taxpayers resolve unpaid taxes and get back
on their feet financially by waiving certain penalties and fees and offering
payment-plan options, according to a news release. Eligible taxpayers could save
35 percent to 40 percent, the release said.

The program ends April 30 and is open only to individual taxpayers who properly
filed their tax returns with the state, and who received a notice for unpaid
taxes prior to Jan. 1.

A similar program was recently conducted for small businesses, Stevenson said.

or warranty, express or implied, regarding title, possession, or encumbrances,
to pay the remaining principal sum due under said Notice of Delinquent
Assessment, with interest thereon, as provided in said notice, advances, if any,
estimated fees, charges, and expenses of the Trustee, to wit: $5,812.70 accrued

POTENTIAL BIDDERS: If you are considering bidding on this property lien, you
should understand that there are risks involved in bidding at a trustee auction.
You will be bidding on a lien, not on the property itself. Placing the highest
bid at a trustee auction does not automatically entitle you to free and clear
ownership of the property. You should also be aware that the lien being
auctioned off may be a junior lien. If you are the highest bidder at the
auction, you are or may be responsible for paying off all liens senior to the
lien being auctioned off, before you can receive clear title to the property.
You are encouraged to investigate the existence, priority, and size of
outstanding liens that may exist on this property by contacting the county
recorder's office or a title insurance company, either of which may charge you a
fee for this information. If you consult either of these resources, you should
be aware that the same lender may hold more than one mortgage or deed of trust
on the property. NOTICE TO PROPERTY OWNER: The sale date shown on this notice of
sale may be postponed one or more times by the mortgagee, beneficiary, trustee,
or a court, pursuant to Section 2924g of the California Civil Code. The law
requires that information about trustee sale postponements be made available to
you and to the public, as a courtesy to those not present at the sale. If you
wish to learn whether your sale date has been postponed, and, if applicable, the
rescheduled time and date for the sale of this property, you may call FOR SALE
INFORMATION, PLEASE CALL (855)986-9342, or visit this Internet Web site
www.superiordefault.com  using the file number assigned to this case 2015-2442.
Information about postponements that are very short in duration or that occur
close in time to the scheduled sale may not immediately be reflected in the
telephone information or on the Internet Web site. The best way to verify
postponement information is to attend the scheduled sale. THE PROPERTY IS BEING
SOLD SUBJECT TO THE NINETY DAY RIGHT OF REDEMPTION CONTAINED IN CIVIL CODE
SECTION 5715(b). PLEASE NOTE THAT WE ARE A DEBT COLLECTOR AND ARE ATTEMPTING TO
COLLECT A DEBT AND ANY INFORMATION WE OBTAIN WILL BE USED FOR THAT PURPOSE.

Jefferson Twp. Sewer Authority struggles with how to approach delinquent
customers

BYLINE: Kyle Wind, The Times-Tribune, Scranton, Pa.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 397 words


Aug. 19--JEFFERSON TWP. -- The township sewer authority is handing over the
first 35 delinquent customers to its new collections agency but on Monday
struggled with whether to give breaks to people with legitimate hardships.

Getting users who are behind on their bills to pay up has been a point of
emphasis since last summer, when financial consultant Mike Gallagher recommended
the cash-strapped operation go after $270,000 worth of delinquent payments from
200 accounts.

Jefferson Twp. residents who are connected to the sewer system must pay $75 per
month in user fees. The sewer authority struggles with about $16.6 million in
debt.

The authority last month began sending letters to its customers who owe the most
money, urging residents to settle up before the operation hands their files off
to Portnoff Law Associates.

Authority members asked residents with economic hardships to contact them before
it was too late, but the authority was split on Monday about how to handle those
cases.

The operation sent out 81 letters to residents who owed $1,000 or more and
authorized solicitor Robert Cecchini to review 35 cases where the residents did
not respond, then refer those accounts to Portnoff.

Among the rest, 26 people paid in full, nine made partial payments, 10 agreed to
payment plans and one was involved with a lawsuit, authority member Michael
Hyduchak said.

He suggested the authority form a three-person committee to review cases, refer
people to possible financial assistance and work out payment plans. The plan got
tabled as the authority debated how to handle it.

Authority member John Giguere was against payment plans, saying the authority
needs a consistent policy it always follows. He suggested requiring people pay
their current bills and pay back their balances within three years with
interest.

"It is not fair anytime that someone (doesn't) have cable, and they don't have
Internet, and they don't have a lot of things and they are hurting, yet they are
still paying the bills that are necessary to pay," Mr. Giguere said. "That gets
us into the decision-making process of who it is fair to charge full price and
who it is not to charge full price.."

MORTGAGE CRISIS: More Atlanta homes at risk;
Clayton County raises alarm bells with high rate of homeowners in trouble, but
even richer metro counties show rises in delinquencies.

BYLINE: CARRIE TEEGARDIN; Staff

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 1A

LENGTH: 887 words


Clayton County's rate of seriously delinquent mortgages has reached epidemic
proportions, with nearly one in 10 mortgage accounts at least 60 days past due,
according to data from one of the nation's largest credit reporting companies.

Clayton had the highest delinquency rate for mortgages in an 11-county area of
metro Atlanta, according to Chicago-based Trans-Union.

But late payments were up significantly in every metro Atlanta county, even in
relatively high-income suburbs such as Forsyth, Fayette and Douglas counties.
The share of seriously delinquent mortgages in each of those three counties
increased by more than 70 percent between the beginning of 2005 and the end of
2007, according to the data.

The data is based on a survey of 27 million consumer records during the fourth
quarter of 2007.

Across metro Atlanta, 4.2 percent of mortgages were at least 60 days past due at
the end of last year. That's 40 percent higher than the national average.

"A lot of those folks are going into foreclosure," said Dan Immergluck, a
professor at Georgia Tech who is an expert on mortgage lending. "What that means
is a lot of those folks are shut off from credit markets for a while. People
think of it as a short-term problem, but it's a long-term problem."

Most lenders seek foreclosure if a homeowner falls three payments behind. Once
the proceedings begin in Georgia, a house can be sold on the courthouse steps in
as few as 37 days.

Foreclosures have reached record levels across metro Atlanta. And every new wave
of foreclosed properties hurts values in a real estate market already flooded
with houses for sale.

Metro Atlanta posted high rates of delinquent mortgages even though it had not
experienced the dramatic run-up in real estate prices that states such as
California and Florida experienced. Metro Atlanta also differs from Ohio and
Michigan, where the economy has taken a nosedive.

"Atlanta doesn't have any of those characterizations of a super-hot bubble or a
super-weak economy, but it's still tracking the national numbers," Immergluck
said. "I think that has something to do with the Wild West lending around here."

Georgia ranked sixth nationally for its rate of delinquent mortgages.

Mortgage failures are now extending beyond relatively risky subprime loans to
the traditional prime loans, experts said. Because prime loans make up the
majority of loans, an uptick in delinquencies in those mortgages has a
significant impact on the total number of foreclosures.

Keith Carson, a senior consultant in TransUnion's financial services group, said
he expects the national delinquency rate to rise from 3 percent to 4 percent by
the end of 2008.

"There is a misconception that this is solely restricted to some subprime loans
and hybrid ARMs [adjustable rate mortgages]," Carson said. "It goes beyond
that."

Immergluck said the rising rate of foreclosures in an upscale county such as
Forsyth suggests the spread of foreclosures into the prime market. In
lower-income counties such as Clayton, foreclosures have become so widespread
that they are likely to have a devastating impact on housing values in some
neighborhoods.

"I'm extremely concerned about it," said Eldrin Bell, chairman of the Clayton
County Commission. "I will do everything possible that I can within the county's
authority to assist with these issues."

Bell said he is personally concerned about the trendlines because many of the
families facing foreclosure in Clayton County are single mothers with children.
Bell said thousands of these families moved to Clayton in recent years with
their eyes on the prize of homeownership.

"I am just beside myself," he said. "To me it's a moral issue and a moral
obligation to protect families, to keep them together. If they get kicked out of
housing, what are they going to do?"

Delinquency rates are high in Clayton, even though the county's residents have
the lowest mortgage balances in the region. The average Clayton mortgage was
$137,000, compared with the region's highest in Fulton County at $271,000.

The average amount owed on mortgages has taken a hit with the foreclosure
crisis, the TransUnion data indicated. Across metro Atlanta, the average amount
owed on a home loan declined between the third and fourth quarters of last year,
from $208,000 to $193,000.

TransUnion's Carson said he believed the decline was a result of lower home
prices driven by the oversupply in the market. But Georgia Tech's Immergluck
said he thought the number was driven by the earlier failure of many
higher-priced mortgages.

"I think it's the big loans being pulled out because they have gone into
foreclosure," he said.

FALLING BEHIND

their mortgage payments and likely to end up in foreclosure. A breakdown and the
increase since the beginning of 2005:

Berrien lowers delinquent property tax interest

Berrien County Treasurer Bret Witkowski is encouraging anyone who is delinquent
on their 2015 or prior year's taxes, to contact his office to sign a monthly
payment agreement. If qualified, a payment of 10 percent of the taxes owed is
required by Thursday.

The state of Michigan has allowed county treasurers to help homestead property
owners lower their interest rate on delinquent taxes from 18 percent to either
12 percent or 6 percent, depending on the qualification.

Currently there are more 6,000 properties in Berrien County that owe 2015 taxes,
Witkowski said.

Berrien County is one of only three counties in the state that offer this
program to homestead property owners.

List of tax cheats grows;
Offi cials say most of $148.5 million owed will never be collected.;
SPECIAL REPORT

BYLINE: By Ken McCall

SECTION: MAIN; Pg. A1

LENGTH: 1269 words


Most of the residential delinquencies involve properties like this one at 4145
Middlehurst Lane, Dayton. Belonging to Herbert L. Thomas, according to
Montgomery County records, the property is delinquent $3,224, which is exactly
in the middle of all 21,179 residences that are at least $100 delinquent in the
county. LISA POWELL / STAFF

The recession is over and the economy is supposed to be improving, but a Dayton
Daily News analysis has found that delinquent property taxes in Montgomery
County - a key indicator of economic stability - have surged by more than 70
percent since the summer of 2010.

Fueled by an increase in residential delinquencies, the number of properties
with overdue taxes has increased by close to 40 percent in the last 3? years -
post-recession years when some sections of the country have begun to show
dramatic improvement.

The analysis provides a sobering view of economic vitality in Dayton and shows
how damaging those delinquencies are to schools, human service programs and
government offices.

At the end of 2013, more than 24,000 properties in the county owed at least $100
in property taxes, the newspaper's analysis of data from County Treasurer
Carolyn Rice's Office found. That was a 37.5 percent increase in delinquencies
from July 2010.

In all, owners of those delinquent properties owed almost $148.5 million in back
taxes - enough to run the general operations of the city of Dayton for an entire
year.

And almost all of the increase was due to mushrooming delinquencies among
residential properties. More than nine out of 10 of the 6,612 new delinquent
properties in the county are residential.

The dollar amount, as striking as it might be, isn't the worst news. Most of the
debt probably will never be collected.

At least half of the $148.5 million is from delinquencies that are more than six
years past due. The county's biggest delinquency dates to 1983.

The city of Dayton is owed about $38 million - nearly $30 million from special
assessments often racked up by vacant and abandoned properties.

"That number has grown significantly in recent years," Dayton Deputy City
Manager Stanley Earley said. "And to be perfectly honest, I doubt that we will
recover much of that if any, because they are abandoned houses and a lot of
those people are not here."

Richard Stock, director of the Business Research Group at the University of
Dayton, said the delinquencies are a reflection of the region's economic woes.

"I'm not surprised we are seeing increases in those delinquencies because we are
still sitting there with a great deal of pain from the Great Recession," Stock
said.

Job growth in the four-county metropolitan statistical area has been basically
non-existent since 2010, according to data from the Ohio Department of Job &
Family Services. While unemployment in the region has dropped - from a peak of
51,600 in January 2010 to 30,300 in the most recent report - the lack of job
growth locally puts a neg ative spin on the unemployment numbers.

"What that means is they're discouraged work ers," Stock said. "We are still
sitting there with many people who have had to make tough choices about feeding
their family vs. paying their property taxes."

Beth Deutscher, director of the Homeownership Center of Greater Dayton, said
homeowners who have lost jobs or are working less can find a property tax bill
"easy to set aside," especially if it' not built into a mortgage payment.

"It's a big bill when it comes," Deutscher said. "If people are struggling, it
would be natural for them not to have a significant chunk of money available to
pay.

"It's another indication that people in our region are still struggling."

Biggest losers

No single entity has been hurt more by delinquencies than the Dayton city school
district, which is owed a whopping $46. million.

The city of Dayton comes in second with an uncollected total of $37.7 million.
The Human Services Levy, which funds a number of social service programs, is
next in line, losing out on $15.5 million, while Montgomery County is owed $6.9
million.

Almost two thirds of the delinquent properties - and more than 70 percent of the
delinquent taxes owed - were in the city of Dayton. Trotwood was a distant
second with just under 9 percent.

Craig Jones, treasurer of Dayton city schools, says the lost tax income trickles
down to every aspect of public education.

"That's money we don't have to pay teachers, to pay utility bills, to get
supplies for kids," he said.

Earley said the abandonment of property in Dayton has increased the city's cost
of dealing with those properties, which is reflected in the totals for special
assessments.

The costs of mowing, boarding up and in some cases demolishing the properties go
on the assessments, Earley said. In addition, if an owner walks away from a
utility

- bill, those will also go on the tab.

Getting owners to pay - or even finding the owners - can be another
unrecoverable expense.

Earley said the back taxes and assessments are troublesome, but he is concerned
more about what they reflect.

"What I'm most worried about are the implications of when people abandon their
property," s he said. "What it does to a neighborhood, what it does to a street,
and what the costs are for the rest of society."

gone $74 million for good likely

There is no way of knowing for sure how much of the back taxes are lost, but the
newspaper analysis has found that at least half - and probably much more - of
the $148 million owed in property taxes and assessments countywide will never be
collected.

When a consultant studied the county's tax delinquencies in 2011, he found that
if properties are delinquent more than three years, the chances of collecting
"drops off significantly," said Paul Robinson, Montgomery County deputy chief
treasurer.

The problem is, 81 percent of the total taxes owed are from delinquencies are
more than three years old.

Even if you increase the odds and give the county six years to collect, almost
half of the taxes are on properties that have been delinquent longer.

"Our experience, our non-analytical experience, will tell us that any given
property that is six years delinquent, it's very unlikely that that person is
going to pay it off," Robinson said.

By far, the largest property tax black hole is the old Dayton Tire plant on West
Riverview Avenue. The owner of the 37.5-acre site, now a huge vacant lot, is
listed in county records as J V Properties and Bert Green & Co. of Akron. They
owe $6.4 million in back taxes. The problem is, the property went delinquent 31
years ago, in 1983.

The most delinquent residential property is also a vacant lot - at 519 Norman
Ave. in Dayton, north of Salem Avenue and east of Catalpa Drive. Its owners,
Best Investments Realty LLC, with a post office box in Dayton, owe $184,550 on
the property. The vacant double lot was once home to a 48-unit, U-shaped garden
apartment building, according to county records. It's been on the delinquent
list since 2002.

"You've hit on a really great property to illustrate the challenges of looking
at that delinquent list," Robinson said. "You and I both know there's no way
we're going to get that amount of money, because the property is not worth that
anymore."

The county, however, can't just wipe 519 Norman or the Dayton Tire plant off the
books. State law doesn't give counties the option of writing off bad debts the
way corporations can.

"There's no means for us to say, 'Oh this Dayton Tire, the 30-year debt, let's
just write it off,'" Robinson said. "There's no mechanism in law that says we
can do that."

BRIEF: North Carolina to help delinquent taxpayers pay off debts

Jan. 19--The N.C. Department of Revenue has launched a temporary program to help
delinquent taxpayers pay off their accrued state tax debt.

The Individual Income Tax Debt Payment Program is aimed at individual taxpayers
who properly filed state tax returns in previous years but who still owe the
state money.

Those numbers have grown since the economic downturn, said Revenue Department
spokeswoman Beth Stevenson.

The program will help participating taxpayers resolve unpaid taxes and get back
on their feet financially by waiving certain penalties and fees and offering
payment-plan options, according to a news release. Eligible taxpayers could save
35 percent to 40 percent, the release said.

The program ends April 30 and is open only to individual taxpayers who properly
filed their tax returns with the state, and who received a notice for unpaid
taxes prior to Jan. 1.

A similar program was recently conducted for small businesses, Stevenson said.

issued to the petitioner, Attorney General's Office, Juvenile Probation, and
DCYF, as appropriate.

All names and addresses for summonses will be taken from the information
provided on Family Court petitions as submitted by the petitioners. Copies of
the Family Court petition will be affixed to the summons for service of process.

Thereafter, all summonses for service will be placed into envelopes for the
petitioning agencies. It will be the responsibility of each prosecution officer
or his/her designee to pick up summonses in a timely manner. Summonses will be
located at the Family Court Juvenile Clerks office located in Providence and the
Family Court Clerks Office in the outlying counties on their assigned juvenile
arraignment days.

Each petition will be scheduled for arraignment 14 days after the summons has
been issued by the Family Court.

The prosecution officers for all law enforcement and school departments are to
present proof of service to the courtroom clerk upon calling the case for
arraignment. It will be responsibility of the prosecution officer to return all
undelivered summonses to the clerk along with a detailed reason as to why the
summons was not served (i.e. incorrect address, moved, left area, etc.)

If the juvenile has a scheduled court appearance or an active wayward/delinquent
petition (for which an appearance is required) within 14 days of the filing of a
new wayward/delinquent petition, a summons for the new petition will be issued
for the same date and placed in the juvenile's file to be served in open court
by the courtroom clerk. If a juvenile and/or his or her guardian does not appear
for the scheduled court appearance, a capias will be issued by the court.

Bill gives cities new options in B&O tax collection

BYLINE: The Logan Banner, W.Va.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 484 words


May 22--LOGAN, W.Va. -- The WV Municipal League has announced that bill HB 4163
passed during the 2016 Legislative Session will assist municipalities in the
collection of delinquent Business and Occupation taxes.

HB 4163 provides municipalities plenary power and authority to adopt an
ordinance providing for the publication of delinquent business and occupation
taxes; provides notice requirements; requires policies and procedures regarding
the preparation, publication and posting of a delinquent business and occupation
list; and allows for a reasonable charge to be added to the amount owed by a
delinquent taxpayer to cover the costs of preparing, publishing and posting a
delinquent list. The bill was passed on March 2nd and goes into effect ninety
days from passage.

"Like the State, municipalities are seeing a significant downturn in tax
collections with the energy market weighing in on their general revenues", Lisa
Dooley Executive Director of the WV Municipal League said. "In order to continue
to provide services to our constituents it is imperative that we be given the
tools to collect what is due to the city."

Dooley also said the work of the Logan City Clerk paid off during the session.
Amber Miller-Viars assisted the League in its lobbying effort and from her hard
work the bill has been named by the League as "Amber's Bill".

The WV Municipal League represents all 234 municipalities in the State of West
Virginia and has more than 2,500 elected and appointed members. City of Logan
Mayor Serafino J. Nolletti has served as a board member for the Municipal League
for five years and both Nolletti and Viars have been active in the League
activities. The City of Logan hosted the first Municipal League board meeting in
October of 2015 which showcased the Hatfield McCoy Trails, Logan County Airport,
Chief Logan Convention Center and downtown businesses.

"I am very proud of our City Clerk for assisting the League in getting this very
critical bill passed that will assist all cities in the State of West Virginia
in collecting revenue to support their vital services," said Mayor Nolletti.
"She went above and beyond out of her scope of work to ensure this bill saw
passage and she did it to help all cities."

Viars was quick to give credit to the League and leaders on the State level when
asked about the bill.

"It was an honor to have this opportunity to do this on behalf of the League.
They are a true friend of all cities and give us tools to be more successful,"
Viars said. "I have to credit Senator (Phillip) Blair -- as well as Senator Mark
Maynard -- who are members of the Government Organization Committee. I
appreciate all of their leadership and look forward to working with them on more
Municipal issues in the future."

Walker says arrangement has been made for delinquent property taxes

BYLINE: Philip Gambini, Niagara Gazette, Niagara Falls, N.Y.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 542 words


June 28--Niagara Falls City Councilman Charles A. Walker said Friday that he has
entered into a formal agreement to resolve his delinquent property tax bill, but
his campaign finance reports continue to lag.

The back taxes relate to Walker's single-family home on 16th Street, which he
has occupied since 2007. The property is assessed at $31,200. The delinquent
city tax bill stretches back to 2011, while Niagara County stopped receiving tax
payments on the property in 2009.

The home was moving toward foreclosure until the agreement, where it would have
fallen to the city's "in-rem" assets and been auctioned to the highest bidder.

Walker said the deal struck with the city is standard, adding that he's hopeful
it will allow him and his wife to make good on the property tax debt in full.

"It's a regular in-rem agreement that anyone who falls behind on their taxes can
sign," Walker said Friday.

The Niagara Gazette requested verification of the full amount of city and school
taxes owed on Walker's home. An official in the city's billing department said
the newspaper had to file a Freedom of Information Request to obtain the data.
One was filed with the city clerk's office on Thursday. On Friday, Corporation
Counsel Craig Johnson indicated that the request was in process. City officials
have five days from receipt of any such request to acknowledge receipt.
Fulfillment of a FOI request can take up to 30 days.

Walker said his current outstanding tax bill is about $4,000 on the
1,500-square-foot home.

Walker's agreement is contingent upon a 25-percent down payment on his back
taxes, which he said has been fulfilled as of Friday, and an obligation to make
monthly installments on the tax bill beginning in August. The bill can be paid
down in lump sum at any time over the course of the two-year agreement.

"Sometimes people go through situations and they make decisions and they're not
always necessarily the best decisions," Walker said of his failure to keep pace
with tax schedule.

Other filings are due beyond Walker's property and school tax record. The
councilman told the Gazette Friday that, excepting 2009 financial disclosure
documents being compiled, he is currently up to date with the New York State
Board of Elections regarding his political contributions and expenditures.

"I'm getting paperwork together from 2009, everything else is in place," Walker
said.

The board of elections online database confirmed Walker's comments on his
incomplete 2009 disclosures, but also indicate he has yet to file a report after
January 2013, which the Niagara Gazette noted in an August 2014 article.

In discussing the matter last year, Walker said he did not have any
contributions or expenditures since winning his sixth term on the city council.
Political candidates are required under state election law to file "no activity"
statements even if they do not take in or expend any funds during a given
campaign period.

As of Friday, Walker's campaign committee "Friends of Charles A. Walker" showed
no periodic filings for July 2013, January 2014, July 2014 or January 2015.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Back to Top

The Railroad Retirement Board (Board) proposes to amend part 367 of the Board's
regulations, Recovery of Debts Owed to the United States Government by
Administrative Offset. Specifically, the Board proposes to amend § 367.3(a),
Board Responsibilities. Section 367.3(a) states that all nontax debts over 180
days delinquent shall be referred to the Department of the Treasury for
administrative offset through the Treasury Offset Program as required by 31
U.S.C. 3716. 31 U.S.C. 3716 was amended by the Digital Accountability and
Transparency Act (DATA Act), Public Law 113-101. The DATA Act now requires
agencies to refer to the Department of the Treasury valid, delinquent nontax
debts for the purpose of administrative offset at 120 days. The proposed
amendment to § 367.3(a) of the Board's regulation would change from 180 days to
120 days the debts referred to the Department of the Treasury in compliance with
the DATA Act.

The Board, with the concurrence of the Office of Management and Budget, has
determined that this is not a significant regulatory action under Executive
Order 12866, as amended. Therefore, no regulatory impact analysis is required.
There are no changes to the information collections associated with Part 367.

Bidders purchase more than $686,000 worth of delinquent property at tax sale

BYLINE: Michael P. Buffer, The Citizens' Voice, Wilkes-Barre, Pa.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 300 words


Nov. 11--WILKES-BARRE -- Bidders on Thursday bought 87 properties with
delinquent tax bills for a total of $686,493.51, according to Northeast Revenue
Services LLC, provider of Luzerne County's tax claim services.

The tax claim sale was originally scheduled in September but was postponed due
to the historic flood. More than 600 properties were offered at an upset sale,
in which bidding starts with the amount owed in taxes, fees and liens.

An upset-sale buyer is responsible for all delinquent taxes, debts and liens
tied to a property. Northeast Revenue also conducted a "free-and-clear" sale, in
which the minimum bid was only for legal and administrative costs and was less
than $1,200 for each property.

The properties offered at the "free-and-clear" sale were not sold at an earlier
upset sale.

During Thursday's upset sale, a bidding war erupted over a property at 160
Kimberly Lane in Kingston Township. The bidding started at $17,980.61, and two
bidders went back and forth until the property was sold for $90,000.

Mikhail Chinikaylo of Dallas bought the property, which has an assessed value of
$392,200. Anna Maria Concepcion of the Philippines was listed as the property
owner and owed $5,606.72 stemming from unpaid school taxes due in 2009.

Glenn J. Keller of Jim Thorpe was the other bidder interested in buying the
property. The two bidders shook hands after the duel.

"Sorry I ran you up," Keller said to Chinikaylo.

More than 90 bidders registered for the sales Thursday. Bidders bought 70
properties for a total of $590,044.26 at the upset sale, said Northeast Revenue
manager Sean Shamany.

County holds long-awaited tax sale

BYLINE: Brandi Watters, The Herald Bulletin, Anderson, Ind.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 847 words


Nov. 03--ANDERSON, Ind. -- The county got a chance to rid itself of a four-year
backlog of delinquent property taxes Wednesday as it held what's meant to be an
annual tax sale.

Delays in property tax billing and confusion over new software led to a
four-year delay in holding the tax sale.

In a room typically designated for county board meetings, an auction was held,
allowing the highest bidder to buy the deed to one of 2,867 properties in
Madison County with delinquent taxes.

The tax sale was originally meant to feature more than 4,500 delinquent
properties, but last week, thousands of property owners flocked to the
treasurer's office and paid their bills, avoiding losing their homes and
properties to the sale.

What originally began as $15.3 million in unpaid taxes was whittled down to just
over $12 million by the time the tax sale began.

For Anderson investor Monty Jones, this proved to be an annoyance on Wednesday.
Jones had pre-selected about 10 properties around the county that he'd hoped to
purchase based on the original tax sale list. When he got to the tax sale, he
saw that all of the properties had vanished from the list. The owners had found
a way to pay the county.

"They paid the taxes on them," Jones said, clutching an inch-thick packet of
delinquent properties. It would be pointless to bid on other properties, he
said, because he wouldn't know what he was buying.

Bruce Hains of Anderson was a little more lucky.

He'd already won the bid on a home along East Eighth Street in Anderson and was
hoping to grab a few more before the day was out. "I have a certain budget in
mind that I want to spend. I want to get several properties for that amount, not
just one."

For both men, the tax sale experience was a first.

Others came knowing exactly what they wanted.

SRI Incorporated of Indianapolis conducted the auction for the county. Joe
Edwards of SRI Inc. said the group travels from county to county hosting tax
sales, and sees many familiar faces in its travels.

Big investors, he said, buy the properties in bulk in hopes of making a 10
percent return on their investment within a year.

Once a property is auctioned at tax sale, the lien on the property is held by
the buyer for one year. The original owner has one year to pay off the lien, but
must also pay a 10 percent penalty.

Edwards said the Anderson tax sale saw a businessman from Miami and one from
Brooklyn, N.Y. Both had been seen at other sales across the state.

"They're the groupies," Edwards said. "They go everywhere we go."

Jones said there are three types of people who buy liens at the tax sale.

The first, he said, is just interested in making 10 percent interest and has no
intention of ever owning the property. The second is a local person who wants to
own the property for themselves and hopes that the original owner never pays off
the deed. The third is a combination of both, happy to keep the property or get
a return on the investment.

Hains was the third kind.

With his East Eighth Street property's lien already won, Hains anticipated that
the original owner would pay him back for the lien, but if they didn't, he was
willing to fix the place up and try to flip it when the market rebounds.

At the front of the room, Elwood resident Bob Savage watched the auction list
with hesitation. He hadn't made a purchase yet and it was his first time at a
tax sale. "I don't know if I'm going to bid," he said. "It takes a lot of work
to figure this out."

As properties with delinquent owners were auctioned off in the council chambers
Wednesday, a separate line snaked around the treasurer's office.

Standing patiently in line with tax bills in their hands, property owners from
all across Madison County waited to pay their fall property tax bills. Their
properties would not be auctioned to the highest bidder.

"I'm going to pay all the tax I owe," Mack Reese said, advancing in the line. "I
pay my taxes on time every year."

Reese owns four properties within the county and said he didn't find it
troubling to watch so many homes go up for auction because he is careful to be
on time in his payments.

Steve Dragash hopes the tax sale would mean fewer empty, abandoned homes around
town. Waiting to pay his own taxes, Dragash said his Anderson home is surrounded
by homes that are completely empty, victims of foreclosure or other
circumstances.

He won't see a drastic change for well over a year. Since property owners have a
full year to pay off the lien sold at auction Wednesday, high bidders cannot
step foot on the property until the year has passed.

The county, however, will finally get the money it's been owed for four years.

HE TURNED OVER DELINQUENT TAX FILES

BYLINE: FRANK MURGIA, Robinson

SECTION: METRO; LETTERS TO THE EDITOR; Pg. W-2

LENGTH: 288 words


In response to last week's article ("Tax collection problems persist"),
delinquent real estate taxes in counties other than Allegheny have tax claim
bureaus. In Allegheny County, delinquent taxes are turned over to the designated
authorities.

As former Robinson tax collector, I turned over the delinquent records to the
proper authorities. They are responsible for the collection of those taxes and
have such records.

The current tax collector is to perform the same procedure as I did. All of the
files -- paid and unpaid -- are still on the computer system. This means that I
do not have the records to run over. The matters of computer-crashed files were
on a separate file and contained information and notes on delinquent accounts
and sheriff sales.

I am rebuilding the files from notes in order to check the status of the
accounts. I will then be able to check the accounts as to the status of paid or
unpaid, and to make sure that they weren't paid twice, as happened with sheriff
sales, resulting in refunds.

Mr. [Jerry] Brouker, a longtime critic of financial practices, ordered financial
information prior to his becoming commissioner. After checking with the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as to how to prepare the information, I provided
detailed information, on all accounts by month, which was about 11/2 inches
thick. He never picked them up because he didn't want to pay for them.

I gave the board information on these accounts at past monthly meetings. My
question to the board would be, "Is this practice being done the same as it was
in the past?"

The new treasurer stated that he found 300 businesses not on the tax rolls. My
lawyer sent him a letter regarding these businesses and has still not received a
response.

Potential post office buyer owes thousands to city in unpaid fees

BYLINE: Emily Opilo, York Daily Record, Pa.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 676 words


May 25--YORK, Pa. -- The York County real estate investor who expects to buy the
historic downtown post office owes the city nearly $100,000 in delinquent sewer
and trash bills.

Themi Sacarellos, who does business as MOLT LLC, said this week that he was the
selected bidder for the more than 100-year-old building on South George Street.
The U.S. Postal Service has not confirmed that.

Two months ago, MOLT LLC was among the property owners that were highlighted by
York Business Administrator Michael O'Rourke because they owed large amounts in
delinquent sewer and trash fees. According to a list released at that time, MOLT
LLC owed back fees on 37 properties in the city, totaling $58,234 for sewer and
$39,154 for trash.

City officials released the names of the most delinquent customers in an effort
to collect about $14 million that is owed to the city in unpaid fees. Beginning
in June, the city will, for the first time, cut off water service to those who
haven't paid or at least established a payment plan.

O'Rourke said in an email Thursday that MOLT LLC had arranged a payment plan
with the city for sewer delinquencies, but the company will be considered
delinquent until the full amount has been paid off, he said.

Several attempts to reach Sacarellos Thursday were unsuccessful.

Sacarellos -- who is also the co-owner of Round The Clock Diner -- owns dozens
of properties in York County. Deeds for the various holdings list him as a
managing member for MOLT LLC, a company based in the 900 block of Heritage Hills
Drive in York Township.

York City Council members were alerted to the connection between the impending
post office sale and the delinquencies in an email from a city resident sent
Wednesday night.

York Mayor Kim Bracey responded to the email Thursday morning stating that the
city was aware that the potential buyer owed the delinquent fees, according to
city council president Carol Hill-Evans and city resident Craig Smith, who
received the e-mail. Bracey urged residents to contact U.S. Rep. Todd Platts,
R-York County, about the sale because it will ultimately be a federal issue.

In 2011, the U.S. Postal Service announced that it would try to sell the stately
neoclassical building in the 200 block of South George Street in hopes of
renting a smaller, more manageable space in York's downtown. On Wednesday, U.S.
Postal Service Spokesman Raymond V. Daiutolo Sr. wouldn't confirm the sale of
the property. Nothing is official until all paperwork and contracts have been
signed, he said.

Sacarellos told the York Daily Record Wednesday that he was unsure what his
plans were for the old post office, but noted that it would be suited for
restaurants and offices.

Kevin Schreiber, city director of economic and community development, said
Thursday that the sale of the building does not appear to be complete. The post
office has not confirmed anything, he said.

"Am I concerned? Yes," Schreiber said. "But I don't think it's done."

The city has been in touch with Platts, and at the end of the day, it's a
federal government decision, Schreiber said. Platts was not immediately
available for comment Thursday night.

The city would like to see legislation barring the federal government from
selling buildings to buyers who are not in good standing with local
municipalities, Schreiber said.

"All we can do it make sure they're informed," he said.

Story so far

The building: In 2011, the U.S. Postal Service put the property on the market,
saying it was too expensive to maintain.

The potential buyer: Themi Sacarellos, doing business as Molt LLC, said he was
the selected bidder on the building.

"I've been chasing that property for three years," he said Wednesday. "That's
the only building that looks like that in the whole city."

Quantico Mayor Owes Town $2,500 in Taxes; Additional $10,222 Still Due to County

Justin Blum, Washington Post Staff Writer

SECTION: PRINCE WILLIAM EXTRA; Pg. V03

LENGTH: 522 words


When the Quantico town treasurer posted a one-page computer printout of
delinquent taxpayers on her office window recently, a familiar name appeared
among the 14 scofflaws:

Albert R. Gasser Jr., mayor of Quantico.

He owes the town of 670 residents about $ 2,500 in property taxes, penalties and
interest, according to Treasurer Georgia Raftelis.

Gasser, who was elected to a two-year term in 1996 and served one previous term
as mayor, said yesterday that he was suffering financial problems and could not
afford to pay his debt.

He said he hopes to pay the taxes soon.

"It's a question of not at the present time being able to pay," Gasser said.
"It's not a purposeful act. It's caused by personal circumstances. It has
nothing to do with my performance as mayor, my duties as mayor."

In addition to owing Quantico, Prince William County records show that Gasser
owes the county $ 10,222 in property taxes, penalties and interest.

Town Council member Elizabeth Ann Mooney said that she was surprised to hear
Gasser was on the town's list of delinquent taxpayers and that he's setting a
bad example that might cause other residents to ask, "If the mayor can get away
with it, why can't we?"

"Personally, I don't think with him owing the town he should be mayor," Mooney
said. "I feel like he should have worried about his own property and his own
business before he tried to take on the town's business."

The mayor's failure to pay taxes has not caused much of a shortfall in the $
424,000 budget, but Mooney said the additional money could be used to fund a new
playground, landscaping or to spruce-up of the town's community center.

Other council members said the delinquent taxes are no big deal.

"It don't bother me," said council member Leroy Riddick. "I don't bad-mouth
people."

Council member Mitchel P. Raftelis, husband of the treasurer, said the mayor
shouldn't be treated any differently than any other delinquent taxpayer.

"I don't understand what the problem is here," Raftelis said. "It's just a
routine thing. It would be just like the president of the United States or a
senator or any other public official. Why would you want to point that out?"

Gasser owns nine properties and is delinquent on five of them, said Georgia
Raftelis. He was delinquent on three properties in 1996, another property in
1995 and 1996 and the fifth property from 1993 to 1996, she said.

Gasser runs the Command Post Pub and owns several residential properties. He
said a recent expansion of the pub and the failure of several tenants to pay
their rent has made it impossible for him to pay his property taxes.

He said that he has sold one of the properties on which he owes taxes but that
it remains in his name.

"I'm embarrassed I can't meet my obligation," Gasser said. "I'm trying to be a
productive citizen and a contributing citizen."

Howard Bolognese, the town's former mayor, said the outstanding tax bill casts
Quantico in a negative light.

"It doesn't look too good, does it?" Bolognese said.

"But the man's in business. His business has been bad. He can't do no better."

undersigned a written Declaration of Default and Demand for Sale, and a written
Notice of Default and Election to Sell. The undersigned caused said Notice of
Default and Election to Sell to be recorded in the county where the real
property is located and more than three months have elapsed since such
recordation. NOTICE TO POTENTIAL BIDDERS: If you are considering bidding on this
property lien, you should understand that there are risks involved in bidding at
a trustee auction. You will be bidding on a lien, not on the property itself.
Placing the highest bid at a trustee auction does not automatically entitle you
to free and clear ownership of the property. You should also be aware that the
lien being auctioned off may be a junior lien. If you are the highest bidder at
the auction, you are or may be responsible for paying off all liens senior to
the lien being auctioned off, before you can receive clear title to the
property. You are encouraged to investigate the existence, priority, and size of
outstanding liens that may exist on this property by contacting the county
recorder's office or a title insurance company, either of which may charge you a
fee for this information. If you consult either of these resources, you should
be aware that the same lender may hold more than one mortgage or deed of trust
on the property. NOTICE TO PROPERTY OWNER: The sale date shown on this notice of
sale may be postponed one or more times by the mortgagee, beneficiary, trustee,
or a court, pursuant to Section 2924g of the California Civil Code. The law
requires that information about trustee sale postponements be made available to
you and to the public, as a courtesy to those not present at the sale. If you
wish to learn whether your sale date has been postponed, and, if applicable, the
rescheduled time and date for the sale of this property, you may call FOR SALE
INFORMATION, PLEASE CALL (855)986-9342, or visit this Internet Web site
www.superiordefault.com  using the file number assigned to this case 2016-1454.
Information about postponements that are very short in duration or that occur
close in time to the scheduled sale may not immediately be reflected in the
telephone information or on the Internet Web site. The best way to verify
postponement information is to attend the scheduled sale. THE PROPERTY IS BEING
SOLD SUBJECT TO THE NINETY DAY RIGHT OF REDEMPTION CONTAINED IN CIVIL CODE
SECTION 5715(b). PLEASE NOTE THAT WE ARE A DEBT COLLECTOR AND ARE ATTEMPTING TO
COLLECT A DEBT AND ANY INFORMATION WE OBTAIN WILL BE USED FOR THAT PURPOSE.

the auction, you are or may be responsible for paying off all liens senior to
the lien being auctioned off, before you can receive clear title to the
property. You are encouraged to investigate the existence, priority, and size of
outstanding liens that may exist on this property by contacting the county

fee for this information. If you consult either of these resources, you should
be aware that the same lender may hold more than one mortgage or deed of trust

DAYTONA AIRPORT

Passenger traffic up

DAYTONA BEACH -- In April, 54,603 passengers traveled through Daytona Beach
International Airport, a 16 percent increase from in April 2010.

For the 12-month period that ended April 30, passenger traffic was up 17 percent
compared to the previous year.

Airport Director of Business Development Steve Cooke said much of the traffic
increase was because of Delta increasing its flight capacity. "I think they put
a little more emphasis on Daytona Beach," he said.-- Hilary Lehman

STATE MOVES TO COLLECT $10 MILLION IN DEBTS HIRES 3 AGENCIES TO TRACK;
DELINQUENT BILLS

BYLINE: Tim Novak Illinois State Correspondent

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 7A

LENGTH: 266 words


SPRINGFIELD, Ill. - Illinois has hired three collection agencies to recoup at
least $10 million in delinquent debts so the state can pay its own bills.
''Bills that go uncollected simply add to the state's already serious cash-flow
problems,'' said State Comptroller Dawn Clark Netsch. ''This leaves us with few
dollars to pay our own bills for the vital services needed by the people of this
state.'' Tax revenue has fallen short of expectations. State officials blame
that on the recession.  At the start of the year, Illinois owed about $1 billion
on various bills, some of which were several months delinquent. For instance,
the state borrowed $500 million earlier this month to pay late Medicaid bills.
The state's Debt Collection Board - Netsch, Attorney General Roland Burris and
Central Management Services Director Stephen B. Schnorf - decided the collection
agencies might be able to supplement the tax coffers.  ''These collection
agencies will be used by the state to aggressively follow up on delinquent
accounts that state agencies have tried without success to collect,'' Burris
said.  ''Some of the larger agencies, such as the Department of Revenue and the
Department of Public Aid, have successfully used collection agencies for
years,'' he added.  ''However, this will be the first time many state agencies
will have the opportunity to use such a service.'' The collection agencies - GC
Services of Schaumburg, Midwestern Account Consultants of Chicago Heights, and
Harvard Collection Services of Chicago - will be paid contingency fees from the
money they collect.

Freddie Mac To Buy Nearly All Delinquent Mortgages

NEW YORK-Freddie Mac said last week it plans to buy substantially all loans that
are delinquent 120 days or more from its fixed and adjustable-rate
mortgage-backed participation certificate securities. The move is a result of
switching its accounting, as of Jan. 1, to conform to new standards that require
financial institutions to hold all performing and nonperforming loans on their
books, and to do away with off-balance sheet vehicles.

The company said it is cheaper to buy and hold these nonperforming loans on its
books than it would be to pay guarantee fees to security holders. Initial
analyst estimates put the unpaid principal balance on Freddie Mac's
120-days-plus delinquent loans at nearly $70 billion.

As an added benefit, Freddie Mac said the purchases will help to preserve its
capital, and to reduce the amount it draws from the U.S. Treasury to sustain its
operations. Freddie Mac will have to raise capital to buy out the loans, and
this is expected to be done through the sale of its debt to investors and the
sale of mortgage pools.

CUCorp Enhances Its Invest In America Program

LIVONIA, Mich.-In a move to bolster even stronger CU support for Invest in
America, CUCorp is rolling out additional incentives for the car-buying discount
program. The new "Private Offer" provides an additional $750 off GM vehicles
when a member gets CU financing. Invest in America's standard GM Supplier
Pricing discount of 5% to 10% off MSRP, still applies.

This additional discount, CUCorp CEO David Adams told Credit Union Journal, is
to be used by credit unions for targeted marketing. "Maybe the credit union has
a certain number of members who have car loans that are maturing. They can now
offer them an additional $750 discount just for being a credit union member, and
the credit union is guaranteed to get the loan if the member buys the car."

CUs can only make the offer to specific employee groups. From March 1 to April
30, the offer will be extended to healthcare professionals, May through June
will be for education professionals, July through August will be for public
service professionals, September through October will be for labor and trade
professionals, and November through December will for military professionals.

To participate CUs must register for an offering 45 days in advance of its start
date by either going to www.lovemycreditunion.org or by contacting Invest in
America staff at CUCorp. Participating credit unions will be sent a marketing
mailer to send to eligible members that includes a code so the member can come
specifically to that credit union for financing to receive the discount.

CUCorp is a subsidiary of the Michigan CU League.

NM Deposits Could Go To CUs

ALBUQUERQUE, N.M.-This state's legislature has voted to move at least $2 billion
from large financial institutions into credit unions and community banks. The
New Mexico House of Representatives has voted 65-0 to approve a bill allowing
the state to move between $2 billion and $5 billion in state funds to the
smaller institutions. The bill still requires approval by the New Mexico Senate,
but observers say that is likely. Gov. Bill Richardson has said he will sign the
bill if approved.

Jailer Alleged 'Mumbling' Bandit

MEMPHIS, Tenn.-A former local jailer has been arrested here and charged with
being the "mumbling" bandit who failed in two robbery attempts at credit unions
last week. Phtosa Dennis, 42, has bee charged with bank robbery and using a gun
during one of the crimes. Since 1997, Dennis has been employed as a jailer in
Shelby County, Tenn. As reported earlier by Credit Union Journal, it is alleged
that Dennis failed in her attempts to hold up two local credit unions on the
same day last week because the tellers couldn't understand her, one time
stumbling outside as her gun clattered to the sidewalk.

The bumbling bandit struck the first time at Southern Security FCU, but the
teller couldn't understand the suspect's mumbling demands. The suspect then
produced a hold-up note, which she flung at the teller before running from the
building.

The hapless bandit then tried to rob a branch of First South CU, but she fumbled
with her purse, then approached the counter after a teller asked several times
if she needed help. The woman handed the teller a note, but the teller retreated
when the woman pulled a gun. The would-be robber then ran from the credit union,
tumbling on the sidewalk and dropping her weapon before leaving without any
cash.

SARASOTA COUNTY: Amount of unpaid property taxes down, but trouble remains

In a sign that at least part of Southwest Florida's economy is recovering,
unpaid property taxes fell by one-fifth this year in Sarasota County.

But delinquent taxes are still more than triple what they were eight years ago
-- underlining continuing troubles for large developments, particularly in the
county's southern half.

More worrisome even than the number of delinquent properties, though, is that in
more than half the cases -- 6,300 parcels -- no one has stepped in to pay the
taxes under Florida's tax certificate system.

Under that program, investors pay delinquents' taxes in return for a guaranteed
5 percent return over two years, plus interest set at auction.

Investors have shied away from the most troubled and most encumbered properties.
Last year, 3,400 parcels fell into that category. The year before it was only
721.

"There's no demand for vacant lots. That's what most of that stuff is," said
Debbie Coulter, tax administrator for the Sarasota County Tax Collector's
office.

To a large degree, this year's tax delinquents are the same as those in 2011:

Thomas Ranch owner Fourth Quarter Properties and Thomas Ranch developer Gran
Paradiso top the 2012 list, as they did last year.

Lee Wetherington Development, the developer of the Sarasota National community
that is between Venice and North Port, and the North Port Park of Commerce.

Marsh Creek Holdings, another North Port landowner, made this year's list but
paid its $370,000 in back taxes on May 31. It is now current.

A Cape Coral firm, HMTA Real Estate also paid its $142,000 tax bill on the eve
of this year's auction on June 1.

Sarasota real estate investor Rodney Dessberg was sixth on this year's list,
owing $247,000. He also was delinquent on taxes on eight properties last year,
but subsequently paid the outstanding taxes.

Dessberg declined to discuss in detail the rationale behind paying property
taxes two months late.

"It's purely an economic strategy having to do with the time value of money," he
said.

In a list advertised by the county tax collector on May 1, Fourth Quarter
Properties and an affiliated group were late in paying $4.9 million in property
taxes. Additionally, the company has not made amends on at least a portion of
the $4.7 million in taxes delinquent from last year.

Defaulting districts

A number of big property owners have failed to pay their taxes since the
downturn started in 2007.

Gran Paradiso, the Thomas Ranch developer, has been at or near the top of the
list of the biggest tax delinquents for four years in a row.

But Florida's tax certificate system gives property owners two years to pay off
the buyers of the certificates.

If the payoff is not made, the certificate owner can move to seize the property.

One strategy bigger tax delinquents seem to employ is to never get more than two
years behind on their taxes, in an effort to wait out any downturn in housing.

As for Fourth Quarter Properties: "They have been managing that so that they can
continue to keep their options open," said Jeff Boone, the developer's local
attorney.

That investors were unwilling to pay the taxes on more than half the delinquent
properties this year is likely because the land is encumbered by debt and would
not be worth repossessing, Boone said.

"That tells me that the easy properties to acquire, clean up and flip have been
picked through," he said.

Many of the delinquencies are in community development districts, including
Sarasota National and Thomas Ranch, where the infrastructure was financed by
selling bonds to the public.

Experts contend that trend is likely a reflection of what is going on statewide.

In Florida, 184 of these districts have gone into default by missing a bond
payment or, in some cases, many bond payments, said Richard Lehmann, who
publishes floridacddreport.com, which tracks these districts' defaults.

In all, $5.5 billion in bonds are in default in the state, he said.

"Anybody that bids on a tax certificate on a CDD property has to do so with the
idea that, No. 1, he's going to have to foreclose on the property and take it
over," Lehmann said.

But for these properties to be developed someday, the liens that bondholders and
governments have will need to be reduced, he said.

"There's simply too much bond debt to be serviced for them to be competitive,"
Lehmann said.

Falling rates

One positive sign is that the average interest rate bid on a tax certificate
fell to 3.4 percent in the June 1 bids, compared with 7.7 percent last year.

Of the bids that were made, certificate buyers accepted much lower interest
payments, records show.

That may signal increased investor confidence in property owners' ability to pay
back certificate buyers.

Dropping off the list of the biggest delinquents was SLAB LLC, the Kansas-based
owner of the Ritz-Carlton Sarasota hotel and resort. While SLAB always pays its
taxes, it often appeals the amounts and pays late.

Irish American Management Services Ltd., the Dublin-based would-be developer of
the Sarasota Quay project back in 2004, also dropped from this year's list. The
company is now controlled by Ireland's national bank.

Another non-repeater is Post Office Associates, a group controlled by attorney
and investor David S. Band, high-end commercial real estate broker N.J.
Olivieri, and their families. It sold the Sarasota Post Office complex on
Ringling Boulevard downtown to its tenant, the U.S. Postal Service, last year.

The company was the 10th largest tax delinquent in 2011, owing $144,000 in
property taxes. But as part of a settlement with the Postal Service, the sale
was effectively backdated to 2009.

Because the Postal Service is a public entity and exempt from property taxes,
the transaction wiped out the tax debt -- even though a tax certificate buyer
had stepped in to pay the taxes.

As a result, local governments were forced to disgorge the money owed.

BRIEF: Database shows delinquent Guilford County taxpayers

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 172 words


March 20--Did you pay your property taxes last year?

Better hope so. Because the Guilford County Tax Department's list of delinquent
taxpayers is open for your perusal on the News & Record's website.

Every March, the department compiles a list of property owners who haven't paid
their taxes for the previous year.

Taxes for 2014 were due Dec. 31.

The department collects county property taxes, as well as property taxes for
Greensboro, Jamestown, Oak Ridge, Pleasant Garden, Sedalia, Summerfield and
Whitsett, and parts of Archdale, Burlington, Kernersville and High Point.

The annual public shaming is a strategy to shake loose the stragglers and bring
more money into the government's coffers.

County tax officials said they usually can expect to collect 98 percent of
what's owed to them each year.

Fla. still tops in mortgage delinquencies ;
 Nearly 20 percent of borrowers are 90 days past due or in foreclosure.

BYLINE: By JEFF OSTROWSKI Palm Beach Post Staff Writer

SECTION: A SECTION; Pg. 1A

LENGTH: 339 words


Florida still leads the nation in the percentage of homeowners who are
"seriously delinquent" on their loans, the Mortgage Bankers Association said
Thursday.

In the state, 19.52 percent of borrowers were either 90 days past due or in
foreclosure in the third quarter. Add in borrowers who are 30 and 60 days late,
and nearly one in four Floridians are behind on their loans.

The good news is that Florida's seriously delinquent rate is down from 20.13
percent in the second quarter. But no other state met Florida's lofty level of
late payers. Nevada was No. 2 at 17.83 percent, while Illinois' 10.77 percent
ranked third.

With Florida's job market still weak and home prices way down from a few years
ago, it's no surprise that the state's delinquency rates are so high, said Jack
McCabe, a real estate analyst in Deerfield Beach.

"With 48 percent of the state's homeowners underwater, we're going to continue
to see delinquencies go up," McCabe said. "The truth is a lot of people have
given up and have stopped paying their mortgages."

Part of the blame lies with the way foreclosures are handled in Florida, said
Michael Fratantoni, the Mortgage Bankers' vice president of research and
economics. Florida and other states where foreclosures go through the courts
have foreclosure inventories that are twice as high as so-called non-judicial
states, he said.

Of course, the court system is only partly to blame for Florida's delinquency
problem. The bigger culprits are a withering collapse in prices and an 11.9
percent jobless rate that's well above the national unemployment rate of 9.6
percent.

Nationally, the delinquency rate fell, too, which the Mortgage Bankers
Association attributed to modest improvements in the job market. The foreclosure
freeze at some lenders hasn't played a role in falling delinquencies.

"The foreclosure paperwork issues announced by several large servicers in late
September and early October are unlikely to have had a large impact on the
third-quarter numbers," Fratantoni said.

Housing temblor shakes markets Dow drops 242 as mortgage report shows
delinquencies up even among prime loans Home prices overall could decline this
year as the nationwide foreclosure rate for all mortgages hits its highest level
in the survey's 37-year history.

BYLINE: Will Shanley Denver Post Staff Writer

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. C-01

LENGTH: 922 words


A growing number of homeowners in Colorado and nationwide fell behind on
mortgage payments during the final three months of 2006, sending the stock
market tumbling and indicating that home prices overall could fall this year.

A report released Tuesday by the Mortgage Bankers Association, combined with
tepid retail sales numbers for February, spooked investors and sent stocks
sliding, erasing gains made in recent sessions.

The Dow Jones industrial average shed 242.66 points, or 1.97 percent, to close
at 12,075.96. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite both ended the day down.

The housing report covers more than 43 million loans, including 33.3 million
prime loans, 6 million subprime loans and 4 million government loans.

Nearly one of every 20 home mortgage loans, or 4.95 percent, was past due.
That's up from 4.67 percent during the third quarter.

In Colorado, 4.37 percent of all payments were behind in the fourth quarter.
That's up from 3.9 percent in the third.

U.S. mortgages entering foreclosure rose to 0.54 percent of all loans during the
fourth quarter, the report showed. That ranked as the highest rate ever recorded
in the survey's 37-year history.

"It could get a lot worse," said Michael Kone, a principal with Housingmetrics,
a Boulder- based firm that tracks the real-estate market. "If we see home sales
really weaken, and appreciation goes negative, the latter part of the year would
be dark."

Kone said the fact that delinquencies were rising among prime loans suggested
that even mid- to upper-priced home values could suffer. That segment in Denver
has shown well amid the slumping real-estate market nationwide.

Doug Duncan, chief economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association, predicted
that overall home prices could decline by 1 percent this year, recovering
slightly in 2008.

"There could be outright declines in some markets," Duncan said of his forecast
for 2007.

Tuesday's report showed that delinquencies increased across all loan types,
especially among subprime ARMs, the adjustable- rate mortgage loans made to
borrowers with impaired credit.

Nationally, 14.27 percent of subprime ARM loans were delinquent, compared with
11.72 percent in Colorado. Of all subprime ARM loans nationally, 4.53 percent
were in foreclosure, compared with 5.44 percent in Colorado.

Overall, Colorado homes in foreclosure increased slightly to 1.46 percent.
Compared with other states, Colorado ranked 29th in delinquencies and 12th in
foreclosure rate, the report showed.

States with the highest late- payment rates included Mississippi, Louisiana and
Michigan. States with the highest percentage of homes in foreclosure included
Ohio, Indiana and Michigan.

"Although the U.S. economy and job market remain solid, the housing market
continued to decelerate in the fourth quarter of 2006," Duncan said during a
conference call with reporters. "The significant increases in delinquency rates
(have) in some cases led to unexpected increases in credit losses and the
failure of some subprime specialist firms."

About three dozen of the nation's subprime mortgage lenders - including some
with offices and customers in Denver - have gone under or stopped making loans
during the last few months, according to www

.ml-implode.com, a website that tracks closures in the subprime lending
industry.

The latest example is New Century Financial, the nation's second-largest
subprime lender. Shares of the Irvine, Calif.-based company have fallen from
more than $50 last May to less than $2 before trading was suspended Tuesday. New
Century disclosed Tuesday it is the subject of a Securities and Exchange
Commission probe.

Other subprime lenders, including Ownit Mortgage Solutions and Mortgage Lenders
Network Inc., have recently filed for bankruptcy.

Comparing types of mortgages

Subprime loans: These home mortgage loans are sought by those with limited or
less-than- sterling credit histories, typically with credit scores below 650.
The loans, which often feature adjustable interest rates that move above the
market rate after a few years, are considered relatively risky for lenders and
borrowers.

Prime loans: These mortgages account for the majority of home loans in the U.S.
Borrowers generally have good credit scores, with the loans featuring relatively
low interest rates.

Philadelphia Raises Stakes With Plan to Reverse Blight

BYLINE: By JON HURDLE

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 14

LENGTH: 747 words


PHILADELPHIA -- With an estimated 40,000 abandoned houses, lots and commercial
buildings, Philadelphia wants to consolidate its inventory of distressed real
estate by creating a ''land bank'' to make purchase more attractive to potential
buyers.

If the City Council votes this fall, as expected, to establish the land bank,
Philadelphia will join Syracuse, Macon, Ga., and a number of other cities that
have adopted plans like it to encourage buyers who are committed to making
improvements, instead of speculators, to acquire tax-delinquent properties.

''There are new tools to allow government to acquire tax-delinquent properties
without putting them out on the market to the highest bidder,'' said Rick Sauer,
executive director of the Philadelphia Association of Community Development
Corporations, which is helping to lead the land-bank initiative.

To keep property from speculators who might sit on it for years without
improving it, he said, the land bank would insist that buyers were current on
taxes, had no history of code violations and had the resources to make promised
changes.

''You want to put it into the hands of a responsible property owner who is going
to put it back into productive use sooner rather than later,'' Mr. Sauer said. A
city ordinance ''would provide a means for the land bank to go in and pull those
properties out before they are exposed to the private market.''

Philadelphia's neighborhoods, like those of some other older cities, are
pockmarked with derelict buildings and overgrown lots that have been abandoned
because of foreclosure, unemployment or the decline of manufacturing. The vacant
properties cost the city millions of dollars to maintain, and they reduce the
tax revenue that could come with occupancy. About 75 percent are privately
owned, officials say, and many of those are tax delinquent.

If Philadelphia's proposed land bank succeeds, its scope will become an example
for other cities, like Detroit and New Orleans, that are struggling with large
numbers of vacant properties and multiple city agencies that are responsible for
them, said Frank Alexander, a professor of real estate law at Emory University
and an author of many land-bank laws in other cities.

''If Philadelphia moves forward with this, it will be a very good model for
Detroit,'' which has an estimated 50,000 to 60,000 vacant properties, he said.

The proposal would take advantage of a 2012 Pennsylvania law that has already
been put into effect elsewhere in the state.

In Philadelphia, many individuals are deterred from buying tax-delinquent
properties by having to deal with a maze of public agencies or with difficulties
in finding the private owners. The land bank would take control of vacant,
publicly owned properties from four city agencies, leaving the city in a better
position to combine them with private real estate that it would acquire to
create blocks more likely to attract developers.

The land bank would also be able to acquire specific properties that threaten to
bring down an otherwise healthy block.

''Otherwise, you have a cancer that begins to form, and one vacancy leads to
another, and people stop investing in their homes and businesses,'' Mr. Sauer
said.

Advocates for land banks envision a variety of uses for the abandoned
properties, including market-rate and affordable housing, commercial
development, and open space.

Other uses could include community gardens or urban farms. For the last 17
years, a project known as Greensgrow has been growing vegetables and making
compost on the site of a former galvanizing factory in a low-income area of
North Philadelphia.

This month, Mary Seton Corboy, a co-founder of Greensgrow, gave a tour of the
farm to delegates attending a conference in Philadelphia sponsored by the Center
for Community Progress, a national nonprofit organization that works to
revitalize abandoned and blighted real estate. She said the land, once
designated by the Environmental Protection Agency as a Superfund cleanup site,
showed how abandoned property could be revived for the benefit of the
surrounding low-income community.

Reducing the number of blighted properties also helps maintain the value of
surrounding real estate and saves money on maintenance to prevent further
deterioration, land-bank managers say.

Currently, Philadelphia sells 150 to 200 vacant properties per year, said Mr.
Sauer, who argued that sales would not significantly increase without a land
bank.

''The status quo doesn't work,'' he said.

Over $1 Bil in Distressed Fannie Loans On Market

BYLINE: Mortgage Daily

SECTION: BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS

LENGTH: 245 words


Oct. 09--More than a billion dollars in severely delinquent Fannie Mae
residential loans are being marketed for sale.

The offering is for approximately 7,000 mortgages with an aggregate principal
balance of $12 billion. The loans are non-performing.

Mortgages in the prospective transaction are held in three pools. Offers for the
three pools are being accepted from qualified bidders.

The seller is Fannie, which is marketing the loans in collaboration with Credit
Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities, Bank of America Merrill
Lynch and the Williams Capital Group L.P.

It's the third offering of non-performing loans by Fannie. The sale is intended
to reduce the number of severely delinquent loans held by the Washington-based
company while providing delinquent borrowers with additional options to avoid
foreclosure.

"As with previous loan sales, servicers are required to apply a range of options
to help borrowers avoid foreclosure whenever possible," Fannie Mae Senior Vice
President for Credit Portfolio Management Joy Cianci said in Friday's
announcement. "These actions help in stabilizing neighborhoods and reducing
severely delinquent loans on our books."

The successful bidder will be required to exclusively market the properties to
owner-occupants and non-profits before offering them to investors when a
foreclosure cannot be avoided.

Tax delinquency rate declines

SECTION: LOCAL NEWS

LENGTH: 325 words


Andrew Bird

The Times-Standard

EUREKA --The rate of Humboldt County property owners delinquent on their
property taxes is down more than a percentage point this year compared to 2003.

This is a sign that the overall economy has strengthened, said Stephen A.
Strawn, Humboldt County's treasurer and tax collector.

The deadline to pay the first installment for the current tax cycle was Dec. 10.

Exactly 62,335 property tax bills were paid by the deadline, a rate of 94.64
percent, Strawn said.

Exactly 4,602 bills were considered delinquent as of Friday, Strawn said, a rate
of 4.99 percent.

A small percentage of additional bills were also unpaid, but are not considered
delinquent for a variety of reasons.

In the same period last year, 93.48 percent of bills were paid on time, with a
delinquency rate of 6.26 percent, according to figures Strawn's office supplied.

"I think there is improvement in our communication with property owners," Strawn
said, when asked to offer an explanation for the decline in the delinquency
rate. "But more importantly I think the economy is stronger than the general
media has led us to believe."

Strawn said $39,649,112.95 in property taxes was due no later than Dec. 10.

He said $37,534,357.23 was paid on time, leaving $1,980,604.92 in unpaid
delinquent taxes to be collected.

Last year that amount was $36,717,489.69 in total first installment taxes due,
$34,332,601.06 paid by the deadline of the first installment and $2,301,232.33
considered delinquent after the deadline.

The next installment in the current property tax cycle is due no later than
April 10.

Second installment taxes are worth $39,654,760.42. Added to the first
installment, it totals the entire current tax value of property in Humboldt
County: $79,303,873.37.

Last year that amount was $73,456,162.06.

State law mandates that 10 percent be added to property tax bills paid late.

Nursing Loan Defaults

I f all the people who borrowed money from the Federal Government to study
nursing paid the amounts they are delinquent - not their debts, just their
delinquencies -another 24,000 would-be nursing students could receive loans and
go into training.

The nursing loan program has been so loosely run that $76 million in Government
money was sitting around this summer on the books of colleges that didn't need
it. It cost the Treasury, which has to borrow to finance all such programs,
about $12 million just to maintain these reserves and another $9 million that
could have been realized if the colleges had invested the idle funds.

These are some of the findings of a recent investigation of the nursing student
loan program of the Public Health Service conducted by Richard P. Kusserow, the
Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services. Over all, Mr.
Kusserow found that 48,000 of 181,000 nursing loans, or 27 percent, were
delinquent a total of $19.1 million, due to a combination of poor administration
by colleges and universities and flabby supervision by the Federal authorities.

Even more frustrating, it appears that a number of the delinquents would be able
to make their loan payments and would be relatively easy to find. Of a sample of
9,800 delinquents, 387 were found to work for the same nursing schools that made
their loans, and 395 for the Federal Government, not including the armed forces.
The latter group, somewhat embarrassingly, included 69 people right there in the
Department of Health and Human Services.
Fund for Fortas

I n a world apart from that of his chief public role, Abe Fortas was a dedicated
violinist, helping earn his college tuition in 1920's dance bands and playing in
an informal chamber music group here as he became one of the capital's most
prominent lawyers, a key Presidential adviser and a Supreme Court Justice.

It seems only fitting then that the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts has
created the Abe Fortas Memorial Fund as an endowment that will present series of
chamber concerts. Roger L.  Stevens, chairman of the center board, reports that
more than half the $1 million initial endowment goal has already been raised,
with the two law firms that Mr. Fortas helped found, now Arnold & Porter and
Friedman & Koven, among the major donors.

Advisers to the fund will be Rudolf Serkin, Isaac Stern, Eugene Istomin and
Mstislav Rostropovich, with Marta Istomin as artistic director. Plans call for
the first of an annual series of Fortas Memorial Concerts to be held in the
center's Terrace Theater this spring.
The Span of C-SPAN
C-SPAN, the only national television programming guaranteed to be a s dull, or
exciting, as Congress, is edging into the morning e ntertainment field.
Ordinarily, the cable-satellite public affairs n etwork confines itself to
broadcasting what the industry likes to c all actuality: live gavel-to-gavel
sessions of the House of R epresentatives, Congressional hearings and major
political and g overnmental conferences here.

Even with taping and full-length replays, that left some slack hours on the
tube, so C-SPAN began scheduling live interviews with Federal officials, members
of Congress and print journalists, encouraging viewers to call in questions.
This week the network added an hour at 9 A.M. to those at 5 and 9 P.M., wrapping
their documentary coverage with conversation, if not always wit.

There is some question as to how many viewers are really out there. C-SPAN says
it reaches 11.5 million homes, but that assumes everyone on the cable is tuned
in to public affairs programs rather than game shows, soap operas and reruns of
''Leave It to Beaver.'' This week's star attractions are Eugene Atkinson, the
Pennsylvania Congressman who switched from the Democratic to the Republican side
last year and lost his seat, and Norman D. Dicks, the fifth-ranking Democrat on
the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee.
McNamara Award

R eading Is Fundamental, an organization that fights illiteracy by letting
children pick out and keep books that interest them, is presenting its first
annual award for contribution to youth tonight to Mary Conway Kohler of New
York. During a long career, she worked at the city, state and national level on
problems that young people experience with justice, education and employment.
The award is named for Margaret McNamara, who founded Reading Is Fundamental in
1966; since then, the group has brought more than 50 million free books into
American homes. Mrs. McNamara, whose husband, Robert, served as Secretary of
Defense in the Kennedy Administration, died last year.  Phil Gailey Warren

Alexandria Cracks Down On Overdue Parking Fines

 Alexandria residents are urged to pay any delinquent parking citations
immediately to avoid additional fees and delays in registering their vehicles.

Starting Tuesday, the city will ask the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles to
withhold registration renewals on any vehicle with a delinquent parking fine.

Once a hold is in place, the vehicle's owner will have to pay the delinquent
balance, plus a $20 administrative fee per hold, before the DMV will renew the
registration. Also, three delinquent fines could result in the immobilization of
the vehicle by police.

Other Virginia jurisdictions use the DMV's Vehicle Registration Withholding
Program to collect delinquent parking fines, the city said in a release.

By expanding its participation in the program, the city aims to collect about
$625,000 in unpaid fines and late penalties on 9,900 parking citations issued
from July 1, 2006, to Nov. 10, 2007.

City Wants Volunteers For Potomac Cleanup

Alexandria is seeking volunteers for the Alice Ferguson Foundation's 20th annual
Potomac River Watershed Cleanup and to join others in the region in cleaning up
streams and the Potomac River.

From 9 a.m. to noon April 5, the city will host a cleanup site at Four Mile Run
Park at the Mount Vernon Avenue crossing.

For directions and a list of cleanup sites in Alexandria, visit
http://www.hardbargainfarm.org/trash_initiative/rc_sitesalexandriava.html.

The Potomac watershed cleanup is the largest such effort in the watershed, with
more than 8,000 volunteers. Last year, volunteers removed more than 200 tons of
trash.

Award Candidates Sought By Disability Commission

 The Alexandria Commission on Persons With Disabilities is seeking nominations
for three annual awards honoring residents and organizations that help community
members with disabilities.

One award recognizes an advocate for people with disabilities. A community
organization grant provides up to $1,000 to a nonprofit group in Alexandria for
its services to people with disabilities.

The third award, the Gerry Bertier Scholarship, provides up to $1,500 to an
Alexandria resident with a disability or a student who seeks post-secondary
education. The scholarship honors Bertier, a T.C. Williams High School graduate
who became severely disabled after serving as co-captain of the Titans during
their 1971 football season.

Applications, available at http://www.alexandriava.gov/humanrights, are due
April 30. For information, contact Mike Hatfield at
mike.hatfield@alexandriava.gov, 703-519-3357 or 711 TTY.

Senior Olympics Will Start Sept. 20

The Northern Virginia Senior Olympics, for adults 50 and older, will be Sept. 20
to Oct. 2, officials announced.

The Thomas Jefferson Community Center, 3501 S. Second St., Arlington, will host
the opening day, with welcome ceremonies at 10:30 a.m. to be followed by track
and field events. A mini-health fair, sponsored by Virginia Hospital Center,
also will be offered that morning.

More than 20 other events, including swimming, tennis, table tennis, bowling,
golf, miniature golf, board games and card games, are scheduled during the

Virginia Supreme Court: City of Suffolk v. Lummis Gin Co.

BYLINE: Deborah Elkins

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 458  words


Civil Procedure - Nonsuit - Real Estate - Delinquent Tax Sale

Although the city of Suffolk nonsuited a 1995 complaint to sell the subject
property for delinquent taxes, and then nonsuited a 2006 suit to satisfy back
taxes on the same parcel, that named additional defendants, the 2006 nonsuit was
not a "second nonsuit" that allowed assessment of attorney's fees and costs
against the city, the Supreme Court of Virginia says.

It is readily apparent that Va. Code § 8.01-380(B) draws a clear distinction
between a first nonsuit which must be granted as a matter of right and a second
or additional nonsuit which permits the trial court to assess costs and
reasonable attorney's fees against the nonsuiting party. It is this distinction
that requires this court to first determine whether the nonsuit granted on Feb.
12, 2008, was the first nonsuit as to defendants, "the Baker heirs. "

The record here does not support the Baker heirs' assertion that they were
parties to the prior suit as successors in title to the parcel owner, the Lummis
Gin Company. Assuming they could establish an ownership interest in the property
sought to be sold by the city to satisfy its delinquent tax lien in 1995, the
present action sought recovery for delinquent taxes regarding different tax
years. The delinquent taxes sought to be satisfied in the 1995 proceeding could
not have been the same delinquent taxes sought to be satisfied in the proceeding
commenced in 2006. Because the present action filed by the city was not the same
cause of action filed by the city in 1995, the nonsuit granted by the circuit
court in the prior action did not operate to extinguish the city's right to take
a first nonsuit in the present action.

The circuit court erred in determining in its Sept. 22, 2008 order that its Feb.
12, 2008 order granted the city a second or additional nonsuit, and the court
had no authority to award costs and attorney's fees against the city in the
exercise of its absolute right to a first nonsuit.

Further, notwithstanding the circuit court's attempt in the present case to
preserve the issue by stating the "suit shall remain on the docket for the Court
to determine issues concerning attorney's fees, costs and expenses incurred by"
the Baker heirs, in the Feb. 12, 2008 order, the court still had only 21 days to
resolve the issue before the court lost jurisdiction. The court was without
jurisdiction to decide any issue in the matter 21 days after entry of the Feb.
12, 008 nonsuit order. The Sept. 22, 2008 order awarding attorney's fees and
costs to the Baker heirs was a nullity.

Reversed and final judgment in favor of the city.

City of Suffolk v. Lummis Gin Co. (Koontz, J.) No. 082345, Sept. 18, 2009;
Suffolk City Cir.Ct. VLW 009-6-086, 9 pp.

BILL NUMBER: AB 619 CHAPTERED
 BILL TEXT

CHAPTER  452
 FILED WITH SECRETARY OF STATE  OCTOBER 1, 2013
 APPROVED BY GOVERNOR  OCTOBER 1, 2013
 PASSED THE SENATE  AUGUST 26, 2013
 PASSED THE ASSEMBLY  APRIL 8, 2013

INTRODUCED BY   Assembly Member Garcia

FEBRUARY 20, 2013

An act to amend Section 70377 of the Government Code, relating to
court facilities.


 LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGEST


   AB 619, Garcia. Court facilities.
   Existing law establishes the State Court Facilities Construction
Fund for the planning, design, construction, rehabilitation,
renovation, replacement, leasing, or acquisition of state court
facilities. Existing law levies a state court construction penalty,
as specified, upon every fine, penalty, and forfeiture imposed and
collected for all criminal offenses and all parking offenses for
which a parking penalty, fine, or forfeiture is imposed. Moneys
deposited in the county treasury under those provisions must be
transmitted to the Controller for deposit in the State Court
Facilities Construction Fund. Existing law further requires that any
amounts required to be transmitted by a county to the Controller
under these provisions be remitted no later than 45 days after the
end of the month in which the penalties were collected. Any
remittance made later than this time is considered delinquent and is
subject to specified penalties. Upon receipt of a delinquent payment,
the Controller is required to calculate a penalty on the delinquent
payment by multiplying the amount of the delinquent payment at a
daily rate equivalent to 11/2% per month for the number of days the
payment is delinquent. Existing law requires the county to pay the
penalty amount calculated pursuant to these provisions to the
Controller, as specified, and requires the Controller to deposit
these moneys in the State Court Facilities Construction Fund.
   This bill would require the fines, penalties, and forfeitures
imposed and collected pursuant to the above provisions be remitted to
the State Treasurer, as specified. The bill would require the
Controller to calculate the interest on the delinquent payment, as
specified, and would revise the formula for calculating the penalty.
The bill would also require a county, city and county, or court to
pay the interest or penalty amounts calculated under these
provisions, as specified, to the State Court Facilities Construction
Fund or the Immediate Critical Needs Account of the State Court
Facilities Construction Fund. The bill would authorize the Controller
to permit a county, city and county, or court to pay the interest or
penalty amounts under a payment schedule if the interest or penalty
amount causes a hardship to that entity. Further, the bill would
require that payment be made by the entity responsible for the error
or other action that caused the failure to pay, as determined by the
Controller in a notice given to that party by the Controller, and
would define that entity as including a party that collects the funds
but is not responsible for remitting them to the state if that party
failed to provide or delayed providing the remitting party with
information necessary for remitting the funds. The bill also provides
that these changes apply to all delinquent payments for which the
Controller has not issued a final audit before January 1, 2014.


THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

SECTION 1.  Section 70377 of the Government Code is amended to
read:
   70377.  (a) Any amounts required to be transmitted by a county or
city and county, or court to the state pursuant to this section shall
be remitted to the State Treasurer no later than 45 days after the
end of the month in which the fees, assessments, or penalties were
collected. This remittance shall be accompanied by a remittance
advice identifying the collection month and the appropriate account
in the State Court Facilities Construction Fund or the Immediate and
Critical Needs Account of the State Court Facilities Construction
Fund to which it is to be deposited. Any remittance made later than
this time shall be considered delinquent and subject to the interest
and penalties specified in this section.
   (b) Upon receipt of any delinquent payment required pursuant to
this section, the Controller shall do the following:
   (1) Calculate the interest on the delinquent payment by
multiplying the amount of the delinquent payment at a daily rate
equivalent to the rate of return on money deposited in the Local
Agency Investment Fund pursuant to Section 16429.1 from the date the
payment was originally due to either 30 days after the date of the
issuance by the Controller of the final audit report concerning the
failure to pay or the date of payment by the entity responsible for
the delinquent payment, whichever comes first. In calculating the
interest under this paragraph, the Controller shall apply the average
monthly Local Agency Investment Fund rate over the period of
delinquency.
   (2) Calculate a penalty at a daily rate equivalent to 11/2 percent
per month from the date 30 days after the date of the issuance by
the Controller of the final audit report concerning the failure to
pay.
   (c) Interest or penalty amounts calculated pursuant to subdivision
(b) shall be paid by the county, city and county, or court to the
State Court Facilities Construction Fund or the Immediate and
Critical Needs Account of the State Court Facilities Construction
Fund, whichever is appropriate, no later than 45 days after the end
of the month in which the interest or penalty was calculated. Payment
shall be made by the entity responsible for the error or other
action that caused the failure to pay, as determined by the
Controller in a notice given to that party by the Controller.
   (d)  Notwithstanding Section 77009, the court may pay any penalty
or interest imposed pursuant to this section due to an error or other
action by the court from money received from the Trial Court Trust
Fund. This section does not require an increase in a court's
allocation from the Trial Court Trust Fund.
   (e) The Controller may permit a county, city and county, or court
to pay the interest or penalty amounts according to a payment
schedule in the event of a large interest or penalty amount that
causes a hardship to the paying entity.
   (f) The party responsible for the error or other action that
caused the failure to pay may include, but is not limited to, the
party that collected the funds who is not the party responsible for
remitting the funds to the State Court Facilities Construction Fund
or the Immediate and Critical Needs Account of the State Court
Facilities Construction Fund, if the collecting party failed to
provide or delayed providing the remitting party with sufficient
information needed by the remitting party to distribute the funds.
   (g) The changes made to this section by the act adding this
subdivision shall apply to all delinquent payments for which the
Controller has not issued a final audit before January 1, 2014.

Do you owe back taxes? Pa. tax amnesty plan will be unveiled today

BYLINE: Public Opinion Online

SECTION: LOCAL

LENGTH: 307 words


HARRISBURG (AP) -- Pennsylvania hopes to bring millions of dollars into the
cash-hungry state treasury with a tax amnesty plan to be announced today.

During the 54-day amnesty period, all penalties and half the interest will be
waived for businesses and individuals that pay off delinquent taxes accrued
through June 2009.

The program is inspired by the success of an amnesty last year in New Jersey,
which raised a record $725 million in six weeks. A 1995-96 amnesty in
Pennsylvania waived penalties but required full payment of taxes and interest,
but this year's program follows New Jersey's with a no-penalty, half-interest
offer aimed at enticing more delinquents to settle up.

Pennsylvania included an anticipated $190 million from a tax amnesty program
when it balanced its budget last year.

"That money is already in the budget," Rendell spokesman Gary Tuma said. "The
hope is by offering the amnesty program as an incentive we can bring in the
money we need."

The Revenue Department estimates that the commonwealth is owed about $2.1
billion in back taxes from more than 1 million businesses and individuals,
spokeswoman Stephanie Weyant said. But some of the delinquent amounts date back
to the department's formation in the 1920s and are unlikely to be collected.

Some criticize amnesty programs as undermining compliance with tax laws if
overused, so Pennsylvania's plan includes some disincentives as well as
incentives.

Participants are barred from future amnesty programs, and those who fall into
tax delinquency within two years after the program may have to pay the full
penalties and interest that had been waived. In addition, a 5 percent penalty
will be levied against delinquent taxes, penalties and interest not paid in full
after the amnesty period ends.

Officials also say the commonwealth plans to publish lists of tax scofflaws.

City Council member pays delinquent property taxes

BYLINE: Pat Kimbrough, The High Point Enterprise, N.C.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 422 words


March 12--HIGH POINT -- High Point City Councilwoman Cynthia Davis on Wednesday
paid a delinquent tax bill just before her home was to be included on a
countywide list of liens of past-due properties.

After a reporter from The High Point Enterprise asked Davis about the $419.61
delinquency for 2014 city of High Point and Guilford County property taxes for
her home at 413 Evergreen Ave., she and her husband paid the Guilford County Tax
Department the overdue balance Wednesday afternoon.

Davis, who was elected to an at-large council seat in November 2014, said she
did not know about the delinquency until the reporter informed her of it.

A check of tax records on Wednesday showed that all other City Council members
and Mayor Bill Bencini had no delinquencies on property taxes for their
residences.

Davis said she thought the company holding the mortgage for her home had paid
the taxes, which were due Jan. 6. She said a January letter addressed to her
husband from the mortgage company stated that the full amount had been paid.

"We thought it was paid," said Davis.

She said the mortgage is in her husband's name. Davis and her husband are both
listed as owners of the property on the deed to the home and in tax bills.

Davis and her fellow council members traveled to Washington, D.C. earlier this
week for the National League of Cities Conference.

Information about the cost of the trip was unavailable Wednesday.

"I wouldn't have gone on the trip if I had known about the delinquency," said
Davis.

Tax bills were issued last summer and were due Jan. 6. Records show the Davises'
tax bill totalled $841.61 in city and county taxes.

Tax records show Davis' husband made two partial payments before the due date:
$150 in October and $272 in December, leaving a balance of $419.61.

Guilford County Tax Director Ben Chavis said his office plans to generate the
2014 past-due list this weekend, so all property tax delinquencies still in
place as of the end of the day Friday will have liens attached to them.

Davis said she and her husband, who works in construction, sometimes struggle
financially.

"$419.61 for a family that only makes $20,000 to $25,000 a year -- we're doing
the best we can over here," she said. "We're in the same boat as most of the
citizens of High Point. We're living from paycheck to paycheck. You pay
everything you can to keep the lights on."

HUD to Sell $1.7 Billion of FHA Delinquent Loans

BYLINE: Kate Berry

SECTION: CONSUMER FINANCE Vol. 177 No. F332

LENGTH: 216  words


The Department of Housing and Urban Development will sell a $1.7 billion
portfolio of nonperforming Federal Housing Administration loans in September as
part of a bulk sale program aimed at helping borrowers avoid foreclosure, the
loan sale advisory firm DebtX said Thursday.

HUD created its Distressed Asset Stabilization Program in 2010 to safeguard the
FHA's insurance fund while helping seriously delinquent borrowers avoid
foreclosure. Under the program, seriously delinquent FHA loans are sold for less
than what the borrower owes, which gives investors the flexibility to reduce or
modify the loan's terms. Investors who buy the loans in a competitive bidding
process have to wait six months before proceeding with a foreclosure.

HUD said in July that it would ramp up its bulk loan sales to 9,000 per quarter
from an initial goal of 5,000 per quarter. So far, HUD has sold just 2,100 loans
to date since the program was created in 2010.

The sale of 9,443 loans with an average balance of $182,000 each includes homes
located in some of the hardest-hit housing markets: Chicago, Newark, N.J.,
Phoenix and Tampa. The program is part of the Obama administration's broader
strategy of encouraging public-private partnerships to stabilize neighborhoods
and home values in certain critical markets.

Model predicts which delinquent credit card holders will pay

SECTION: PAYMENTS; News

LENGTH: 504 words



HIGHLIGHT: Research from the McCombs School of Business at The University of
Texas at Austin has identified a way to predict which delinquent credit card
accounts will repay an outstanding balance.


McCombs Assistant Professor Naveed Chehrazi and his co-author Thomas Weber from
École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne in Switzerland worked directly with a
major credit card issuer to develop the Dynamic Collectability Score, which
ranks delinquent account holders based on factors such as size of outstanding
balance, mortgage status, past payment history, credit score, and external
factors such as the performance of the stock market and the national
unemployment rate.

The Dynamic Collectability Score continually adjusts as these variables change
to provide a real-time prediction that is up to 50 percent more accurate than
banks' current scoring systems.

"Any new piece of information that comes in is going to change the prediction of
the model," Chehrazi says. "Each action that's taken -- from a collection phone
call that goes unanswered to a partial payment that the bank receives -- is
factored in to revise, up or down, that person's likelihood of future payment."
That information, in turn, improves the scoring system's accuracy. No other
current scoring system is capable of this, he explains.

Banks can calculate the likelihood that a credit card account will go into
default, but once an account is delinquent, they only have a weak guess about
who is most likely to pay back the debt.

Once an account is significantly past due, banks usually involve a third party
collection agency to attempt to recover payment, but that strategy can be
costly. Banks either sell off the debt for pennies on the dollar or pay hefty
commission rates to recover only a small portion of the debt owed.

Banks need to know which accounts are worth spending money on -- whether sending
them to a collection agency, filing a lawsuit, or taking no action whatsoever --
based on the likelihood of repayment and the amount they can expect to recover.
Having that information would influence the strategy a credit card issuer
follows for each account.

The Dynamic Collectability Score also helps banks better determine their credit
risk capital requirements, or the amount of money they need to have in reserve
to cover future unpaid accounts, known as Loss Given Default.

Current estimation methods can result in projections that are either too low or
too high, costing banks potentially a significant sum either through uncovered
credit risk or increased cost of capital. Using Chehrazi and Weber's Dynamic
Collectability Score could ensure banks are adequately meeting their capital
risk requirements established under the Basel II Accord -- a set of
recommendations for regulations in the banking industry.

"The credit card collection problem is very complicated," says Chehrazi, "and
current bank internal scoring systems are surprisingly poor in predicting
repayment behavior, given the amounts that are at stake."

Chehrazi and his co-author are in the process of expanding the Dynamic
Collectability Score further so that banks can also calculate the optimal rate
to pay collection agencies depending on each account's repayment score.

BILL MAY SPEED TIME LINE FOR TAX-DELINQUENT HOMES

BYLINE: Amy Lane

SECTION: Column; Pg. 6

LENGTH: 521 words


LANSING - Bills that could put tax-delinquent property on a more rapid road to
redevelopment are headed for Senate action this week after emerging last Tuesday
from committee.

Senate Bills 487-489 and 507, part of a 14-bill package addressing urban renewal
and public-housing home ownership, could halve the amount of time between when a
property is declared tax-delinquent and when a clear title can be obtained. The
legislation could shorten that four- to six-year process to 2 to three years,
said Phil Ginotti, administrative assistant to Sen. Bill Schuette, R-Midland, a
primary sponsor of the bill.

''The problem right now is that if a property sits there for four to six years,
the urban mayors said to us, the most attractive thing they can do with it at
that time is bulldoze it,'' Ginotti said. ''The rehab costs would be enormous.''

An April report by the Citizens Research Council of Michigan calls Michigan's
current tax-delinquency and reversion process a ''hodgepodge of common-law legal
ramifications, state statutes and charter provisions ... (that) contribute to an
untenably long process for many tax-delinquent properties, particularly with low
sale value. Therefore, tens of thousands of properties exist statewide that are,
for all intents and purposes, not developable.''

The council report says any reform efforts should consider the property rights
of tax-delinquent owners, the positive and negative effects of county tax sales
and the state's role in reverting property.

Ginotti said the bills protect property owners' rights but would allow courts to
grant foreclosure around 2 to three years after the initial delinquency.
Currently, after a 26-month delinquency period, counties hold a tax-lien sale.
If the lien is purchased, there is still a substantial delay until the
lien-holder assumes final title.

The proposed system would eliminate the tax-lien sale. Counties could take
complete responsibility for a new tax-reversion process, including petitioning
courts to foreclose and dispose of the land. Or they could choose to have the
state handle the process for them, Ginotti said.

And, he said, under one bill, SB 507, a local governmental unit could declare an
emergency backlog of such property and send multiple parcels through the process
in one package.

Incentive could continue

A bill to extend Michigan's main economic development tax-incentive program is
taking off on a fast track.

The Senate Economic Development, International Trade & Regulatory Affairs
Committee plans a Tuesday hearing on SB 573.

The bill, sponsored by Sen. Mike Rogers, R-Brighton, would give four more years
of life to the Michigan Economic Growth Authority program. The state uses it to
offer single-business tax credits to expanding or relocating companies for which
Michigan is competing with other states.

The program will expire Dec. 31 unless extended. Rogers' bill, introduced last
week, would set a new expiration date of Dec. 31, 2003. The state has awarded
tax credits to 59 companies since the program's 1995 start. The tax credits are
tied to job creation.

BRIEF: Deadline July 31 to pay delinquent Grayson city taxes

Jun. 18--Grayson City Council made an unanimous vote Monday to send notices to
all outstanding delinquent tax payers, giving them until July 31 to pay taxes or
their real estate will go up for sale.

City Clerk Cindy Stratton told the council she had talked with one company
interested in buying the delinquent taxes dating back to 2000.

Tax payers who do take care of the outstanding bills before July 31 will have to
pay the face value, penalties and interest (six percent for each year delinquent
) and the publication fee.

"Sending out the notices is the best way to get them to pay and not have to hire
a lawyer," City Attorney Jeff Scott told the council.

Council member Pearl Crum spoke up with concerns for the taxpayers. "Are we
doing the citizens wrong?" she asked the council.

Crum then asked Scott what he thought of the motion. "The selling of delinquent
taxes happens every day," he said.

Following the July 31 deadline all taxes that remain delinquent will result in
the selling of the tax bills.

San Benito tax lag

BYLINE: Fernando Del Valle, Valley Morning Star, Harlingen, Texas

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 430 words


June 27--SAN BENITO -- The city's property tax collections are lagging behind
previous years while at the same time officials are having to make budget cuts.

The city has collected $3.1 million, but projected a collection of $3.3 million
in property tax revenue, Finance Director Susan Crabtree said.

According to the Cameron County Tax Office, the city is owed a total of $3.9
million in property tax revenue.

Officials are counting on property tax revenue to offset a projected $329,353
deficit.

As sales tax revenues plunged to a six-year low, City Manager Manuel Lara asked
department heads to reduce their budgets by 7 percent to offset the projected
shortfall.

The top 10 delinquent taxpayers owe a total of $300,877, county records show.

San Benito Enterprises, owner of the building that housed the former Dolly
Vinsant Memorial Hospital, owes $154,032 in back taxes, making it the taxpayer
with the city's biggest delinquent tax statement.

The company has entered into a payment program to pay the back taxes it assumed
when it purchased the property for $1.1 million at a U.S. Internal Revenue
Service auction in 2008, said Jaime Nieves, chief executive officer of the
Tampa-based company.

"We're being faithful to our agreement," Nieves said. "It's moving forward."

Property taxes make up the bulk of city revenues, accounting for 36 percent of
the $9.4 million general fund budget, said Sandra Rendon, an officer in the
city's finance department.

San Benito, with a tax base of $569 million, has 11,328 property taxpayers,
records show.

The payment of property taxes became an issue here after Mayor Joe Hernandez was
removed in January 2009 when city commissioners cited a City Charter clause they
claimed requires elected officials to forfeit office if they are delinquent on
city property taxes.

Voters re-elected Hernandez in a May election in which many supporters opposed
his removal from office.

In May, school board President Oscar Medrano won re-election despite his failure
to pay city and county taxes on time. Trustee Hector Leal, who also owed back
taxes, ran unopposed for re-election.

The city contracts with the law firm of Linebarger, Goggan, Blair & Sampson to
track down the city's delinquent taxpayers.

SEEKING RELIEF FROM NOISY AC UNITS

BYLINE: RICHARD WHITE

SECTION: HOMELINK; COMMUNITY LIVING; Pg. 2H

LENGTH: 503 words


Q: I live in the topmost floor of our condominium. Unit air conditioners are
installed on the roof of the building, and some are extremely noisy. The sounds
are coming into our unit. Our property manager says the condominium is not
responsible for the units and each owner would be responsible. He says we must
seek relief from the owners. Since the air conditioners are sitting on the roof,
is not the association responsible?

A: Read your documents; most have a section that says owners have the right of
quiet enjoyment or some similar wording. Send this information in a letter to
the board of directors that explains your noise problem. Often AC units on the
roof are placed on a stand mounted on shock absorbers. In most associations,
those stands would be the association's responsibility. The board should at
least take responsibility to notify the owners of the noisy AC unit and request
that they take action to have the unit checked by a qualified technician.

* * *

Outing deadbeats to other owners

Q: Several members of our condo association board are curious whether the board
can publish, in the monthly board minutes, the names of owners who are
delinquent. I understand that liens, foreclosures and bankruptcies are public
information, so is it appropriate for us to publish these unit numbers and
owners' names in the monthly treasurer's report? Like many condominium
associations, we are experiencing substantial financial distress due to
non-payment and some board members think the other owners should know who the
"deadbeats" are. What is your advice?

A: While posting delinquent accounts is not necessarily illegal, it might not
work - the delinquent owners might not respond to the pressure - and likely will
cause bad feelings among neighbors. If someone wants to know who the "deadbeats"
are, the financial records will name the delinquent owners and are official
records of the association. Members have the right to inspect all official
records. The board should publish a general statement about the number of
delinquent accounts but not the details.

* * *

Cutting service to delinquent units

Q: With so many foreclosures, is it legal for a condominium to withhold
services? We have a couple of units that have been delinquent for several
months. The condominium budget pays for cable TV, and we would like to cut this
service to the delinquent units.

A: Florida Statute 720, the homeowners association act, allows cutting of
services, but Florida Statute 718, the condominium act, does not. I suggest you
pose the question to your attorney.

State uses shame to collect taxes Businesses with delinquent bills listed online

BYLINE: TOM KNOXBUSINESS WRITER, TOM KNOX - BUSINESS WRITER

SECTION: SECTION A; Pg. 10A

LENGTH: 942  words


Not even the Men of God can run from the taxman.

The Jacksonville-based auto sales company owes more than $117,000 in unpaid
taxes to the state Department of Revenue. For their delinquency, the Men of God
have been publicly shamed on a list available on the department's website as one
of the top delinquents in Duval County.

The list began publishing in July, and its operators say it's having a positive
effect on getting old taxes paid.

We've collected $780,000 from people on that list," said Jim Evers, program
director for general tax administration at the Revenue Department. A list that
anyone can read -- especially the media, which questions businesses on the list
-- can put pressure on businesses.

Thats certainly not very good publicity for the business," he said.

The $780,000 figure is what has been collected in agreements with the businesses
-- more will come each month. Every business with $100,000 or more worth of tax
warrants or liens against it listed. If a county doesn't have a delinquent
business with $100,000 worth of taxes, the two highest businesses are listed.

When a customer pays state sales tax, (businesses) add it to the bill," Evers
said. "They're stealing the funds."

Still, the list is only a fraction of actual revenue collected. The department
averages about $18 million to $20 million a month in total delinquent-tax
returns. That isn't very comforting to businesses that are on the list, though.

It's not like we took all this money and didn't pay it," said Michelle Flis,
whose husband, Troy, is principal of Spirit of Daytona, a Holly Hill-based
racing team in the Grand-Am series.

We got an audit," she said. "It was stuff we didn't realize we had to pay taxes
on -- services we did for other people, running cars for them at different
racetracks. We didn't morally do it."

She found out the company was on the list a couple of months ago and wanted to
make clear the company's error was ignorance of the law and not malicious.

The company goes by the name SDR Motorsports now, she said. It's Volusia
County's biggest tax delinquent, owing more than $538,000. Almost $140,000 of
that is interest.

It just started working with the Revenue Department to ease the debt, and once
it enters into an agreement, its name should be removed from the list, Flis
said.

It's the only one on the list from Volusia or Flagler that's apparently still in
business. The other companies on the list in Volusia and Flagler couldn't be
reached. Their telephones were disconnected. They are Cycle World of Daytona,
which owes more than $138,000; Zook Heavy Equipment of Lake Helen, which owes
more than $158,000; and the only company listed in Flagler County, RC Images
Quality Printing of Flagler Beach, which owes almost $38,000.

No one picked up the phone at Men of God auto sales, and the call didn't go to
voicemail.

Out-of-business companies that are still on the list have been a common feature
on some of the 15 or so other states that have similar shame lists.

Renee Watters, spokeswoman for the Department of Revenue, said that's because a
lot of businesses fail to notify them.

We often have to talk to landlords, adjacent businesses or utility companies to
verify if they moved or have gone out of business," she said.

Closed businesses that owe taxes are typically given to a forensic-accounting
firm. Warrants filed against them are good for 20 years, Evers said, so a lien
against the business would be in place if its owner tried to sell.

States have been shaming taxpayers for years, especially in the past decade as
they try to find as much revenue as possible. Child- support and individual
income-tax databases are popular elsewhere. Florida doesn't have a state income
tax.

Large, publicly traded companies are rarely delinquent. They can't look bad to
investors. Instead, most are medium to large businesses -- everything from
restaurants to hotels to strip clubs. The delinquent list has about 185
businesses.

Five types of taxes are those most businesses fall behind on, but the revenue
department administers 33 different taxes.

Sales tax is by far the biggest state tax generator. More than $16 billion in
state sales-tax receipts were collected last fiscal year.

If businesses are complaining about the list, they're not telling the Florida
Chamber of Commerce.

We're really not hearing anything from members on this," spokeswoman Edie Outley
said of the chamber's 139,000 members.

Publicizing taxpayers' woes appears to be part of a larger plan to get the state
its money.

In October 2009, the state gathered $14.5 million in delinquencies. That number
doubled to more than $29 million a year later. The department is always looking
for ways to get unpaid taxes from delinquent-business owners.

We've been experimenting with freezing credit cards," Evers said. "If you swipe
the credit card, we can intercept the payment if we know who the merchant
provider is. It's a brand-new program in Florida."

In Volusia, 236 businesses have active warrants against them for being
delinquent. They owe a total of $3.8 million, an average of more than $16,000
per business. In Flagler, 28 businesses owe almost $160,000, an average of more
than $5,700. The two counties have more than 19,000 businesses that collect and
remit sales tax.

Delinquent Collections

Monthly collection of businesses' delinquent taxes in Florida has more than
doubled in a year. Since the top delinquent-taxpayer list began publishing in
July, collection of total delinquencies has increased each month. A tri-monthly
sampling:

OCTOBER: $29,348,048

JULY: $18,876,518

APRIL: $24,522,873

JANUARY: $15,484,359

State outs 39,000 tax scofflaws

BYLINE: Charles Schillinger, The Times-Tribune, Scranton, Pa.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 564 words


Aug. 18--In a first-ever exhaustive list of tax delinquents, the state
Department of Revenue has outed more than 39,000 individuals and businesses in
Pennsylvania that owe $233 million in state taxes.

In Northeast Pennsylvania, Monroe County is headquarters to the most tax
scofflaws, with 943 liens filed on residents and businesses and $5.7 million in
taxes owed. Lackawanna County has 564 liens and $2.8 million in taxes owed.

As court records, the liens placed on the properties of delinquents are public
record. But the state has never before created a complete statewide list such as
the 1,482-page one released Monday. Revenue Secretary C. Daniel Hassell said in
a statement the list is part of a plan to increase enforcement efforts following
a tax amnesty offer that ended in June.

"By naming names online, we hope to shame tax scofflaws into paying their fair
share," Mr. Hassell said.

In the seven-county region of Northeast Pennsylvania, the state list said the
top scofflaw is Bartholomew A. Fiore of Hemlock Lane in Pocono Pines, Monroe
County. He owes $2.16 million in personal-income tax, according to Department of
Revenue records. Efforts to locate Mr. Fiore were unsuccessful.

Second-highest was No. 1 Contracting Corp. of Ashley, Luzerne County, which owed
$987,264 in delinquent taxes. But after the list was created, the company
satisfied the lien, said Stephanie Weyant, press secretary for the Department of
Revenue. She said the list of liens will be updated monthly to add new scofflaws
and take off those that have paid.

The third highest is Petco Inc., a restaurant supply company in Scranton that
owes $739,677 in taxes. There is no relation to the national pet supply chain
with the same name. The company went through Chapter 7 bankruptcy last year, but
Ms. Weyant said the state's lien had yet to be satisfied. Efforts to reach the
company were unsuccessful.

Almost all of the scofflaws on the list will likely be more than a year
delinquent on state taxes because the list represents those who had liens placed
on properties. All delinquents receive several letters, and sometimes phone
calls and visits from the state before a lien is placed on a property, said Ms.
Weyant.

"We don't file liens immediately; people have time," she said.

Liens allow the state to collect when a property is sold or a business goes to
bankruptcy. It also can hamper credit applications.

While the state breaks down the list by county, a county-to-county comparison
might be skewed because liens are filed in the county court where the business
address is located, not necessarily where it does business. All businesses with
addresses out of state are filed in Dauphin County.

Web site 'cybershames' delinquent taxpayers

BYLINE: Staff

Pay your state taxes on time or be CyberShamed, the Louisiana Department of
Revenue warns. Louisiana income taxes are due May 15.

CyberShame, a Web site by the department, publishes names, addresses and the
amount owed by taxpayers with court liens against them.

"People on CyberShame are not just delinquent," said Louisiana Department of
Revenue spokesman Danny Brown. "These people are chronic delinquent taxpayers
and we've exhausted every option we have to collect."

Once a lien is in place, the information is public record. Before publishing
names, the Department of Revenue gives offenders 30 days notice to pay in full
or to make arrangements to pay in installments.

Some published names involve failed businesses with no assets, making it
difficult to collect overdue taxes, Brown said.

Since January 2001 when the site launched, the Louisiana Department of Revenue
has published 726 names and collected $4.42 million in overdue taxes. The site
lists 576 overdue accounts now.

The Louisiana Department of Revenue modeled the system after similar successful
operations in New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Illinois, Connecticut, North
Carolina and Washington, D.C.

"It works," Brown said. "People don't mind being a delinquent taxpayer, but they
don't want their preacher or their mother to know about it." The site is

Pols mi$$ (miss) deadline [Exclusive] 72 skip financial papers

BYLINE: Carl Campanile

SECTION: All Editions; Pg. 8

LENGTH: 536 words


Albany is awash in corruption - but 72 candidates for state office failed the
simplest ethics test by not filing personal financial statements as required by
law, The Post has learned.

"This is obviously the first opportunity for candidates to show that they're
serious about ethics reform," said Bill Mahoney of the New York Public Interest
Research Group.

Records show that six dozen didn't meet the deadline for disclosing their
income, assets, debts and other financial data - which have to be filed within
10 days after the Board of Elections declares them as official candidates.

For most contenders, the deadline was the end of June.

Four candidates vying to replace incumbent Micah Kellner in the 76th Assembly
District on the Upper East Side were branded delinquents by the state's Joint
Commission on Public Ethics.

Democrats Gus Christensen, Ed Hartzog and David Menegon, and Independence Party
candidate David Casavis, haven't filed or were late, officials said.

On Monday, Menegon said he would immediately address the oversight.

"That should have been done," the Iraq war veteran and former Xerox marketing
executive said. "If it hasn't been done, I will follow up."

Hartzog insisted the ethics board had goofed by listing him.

"We have filed this disclosure several times and are working with JCOPE to clear
up this issue," he said.

"I have always been a strong proponent of transparency and reform in government.
I am more than happy to comply with this and every law that shines a light on
Albany."

As for Christensen, he said he filed late because he got an extension on his tax
returns and simply needed more time.

"My paperwork is in and I am in total compliance," he told The Post on Monday.

Christensen, a former manager at the Evercare Partners investment firm,
contacted state officials on his own last week to deal with the matter.

But because he missed the deadline, his name will remain on the list of
delinquents with a notation explaining he complied after the deadline.

Another candidate, Democrat Rebecca Seawright, filed on time.

Not one candidate has filed in the Brooklyn race to replace William Boyland Jr.,
who forfeited his 55th Assembly District seat after being convicted of bribery
and other corruption charges. The district covers some of the city's neediest
neighborhoods .

The delinquents are Democrats Latrice Walker, Roy Antoine, Christopher
Durosinmi, Bilal Malik and David Miller.

Candidates face fines if they don't comply after being informed by JCOPE of
their delinquency.

NC House candidate owes property taxes

BYLINE: Paul A. Specht, Eastern Wake News (Zebulon, N.C.)

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 470 words


Nov. 03--RALEIGH -- Chris Malone, the Republican nominee for state House in
District 35, owes Wake County $263 in delinquent property taxes on two vehicles
he owns with his wife.

Chris and Rebecca Malone owed $171.32 on a 2008 Dodge truck, and $91.82 on a
2006 Chrysler van, according to Wake County tax record listings on Oct. 29.

The taxes were due by Aug. 1, and began accruing interest on Sept. 4.

The county has blocked the Malones from renewing their vehicle registrations
until the taxes are paid.

Malone in an Oct. 26 interview said he's aware the taxes are delinquent. He says
he pays them late on purpose.

"I pay for (vehicle taxes) at the last second because I think they're wrong,"
Malone said. "It's a matter of principal. I pay taxes when I buy the car, when I
renew my license, and on every single car every single year simply because I own
the car. I don't like it, and, if elected, would consider repealing the vehicle
tax."

The Malones are not alone in letting their vehicle taxes slip into delinquency.
According to the Wake County Revenue Department, about 20 percent of all vehicle
taxes are not paid until delinquent.

"About 14 percent (of car owners in Wake County) let their bill slip four months
into delinquency," said Marcus Kinrade, director of the department.
"Unfortunately, it's quite common for people to pay their (property tax) bills
late."

The Malones also owe $2,008 in taxes for their property on Holding Avenue in
Wake Forest. However, real estate taxes are not delinquent until interest begins
accruing on Jan. 8, 2013.

Each candidate in this N.C. House race has been attacked for property tax
payments.

Lori Millberg, Malone's Democratic opponent from Wendell, on Oct. 17 posted a
photo copy of Malone's delinquent tax records on her Facebook page. Millberg's
Facebook comment: "Y'all know what I'm saying about people who live in glass
houses?" referenced a print ad recently distributed by the North Carolina
Republican Party which said Millberg "failed to pay her taxes."

Millberg has never failed to pay her taxes.

The GOP mailer, which Malone did not pay for or endorse, hit Millberg for paying
her 2010 property taxes four months late, after they were delinquent. Millberg
and her husband, John, owed about $2,020 on two properties. Millberg has said
they paid them late because her brother died in fall 2010, when the bills were
due, and she lost track of them. The only other year Millberg let her property
taxes slip into delinquency was in 2009. She paid them two days after interest
began accruing.

Neither of the candidates' tax records is uncommon, officials at the Wake County
Revenue Department said.

Md. gives HOAs some financial relief when a lender forecloses

BYLINE: Benny L. Kass

SECTION: REAL ESTATE; Pg. E02

LENGTH: 682 words


If you live in a Marylandcondominium or are in a homeowners' association, the
Maryland General Assembly has just provided you a modicum of protection from
neighbors who don't pay their dues. For first-trust mortgages recorded after
October 1, if the homeowner is delinquent on association fees when a lender
forecloses, the lender will have to pay the association up to $1,200 of the
delinquency.

Without such a law, when a lender forecloses on a home in a community
association, there is no practical way the association can recoup any money that
the homeowner owes. Although a delinquency can become a lien against the home,
the lien is erased by foreclosure. Suing the delinquent homeowner is often a
wasted exercise; there may be no money available to collect even if the courts
award a money judgment to the association.

Over the years, many states have recognized that this is unfair to the rest of
the association members. Community associations rely on fees collected from
homeowners in order to survive.

For example, in the District, if an institutional lender forecloses, it must pay
the association up to six months of the delinquent assessments. Virginia has no
such super-assessment priority laws. But 15 other states have enacted laws that
provide a priority of six months' worth of delinquent fees or more. Delaware
adopted a six-month priority law in 2008; Florida extended its priority lien
from 6 months to 12 months last year.

For many years, community association leaders such as the Community Associations
Institute have been trying to get such a priority-lien law in Maryland. But the
bankers and other financial institutions have a strong lobby and vigorously
opposed any infringement on their right to foreclose. Finally, in the waning
hours of the 2011 Maryland legislative session, a compromise measure was
reached.

The new law gives community associations a four-month priority lien over any
first mortgage recorded after October 1. But that is capped at $1,200, which may
be considerably less than the delinquency. Furthermore, while other state laws
include such items as late fees, legal fees and special assessments in the
computation of the delinquency, in Maryland the amount of the delinquency can be
based only on the actual, unpaid regular assessment.

According to Hugh Lewis, a community association lawyer in Bellingham, Wash.,
"Maryland's new law runs counter to the evolving trend. Freddie and Fannie
accept project documents which give an association's lien a superpriority over
the lien of the first mortgage of up to six months. Holding the superpriority to
four months and capping that at $1,200 is regressive."

But Maryland lawyers who actively lobbied for this legislation are pleased to
have gotten this far after so many frustrating years of being rejected by the
legislature. According to Tom Schild, a community association lawyer in
Rockville, "would we have preferred six months plus late fees, interest and
collection costs? Yes. Was it achievable in light of local/state politics? No."

Foreclosures hurt community associations in their pocketbook. At least, some
financial assistance will now be available in Maryland, but only for future
loans that may be foreclosed upon. The new law will not practically become
useful for a long time. Lenders are now very conservative in deciding whether to
make loans. Credit scores must be fairly high and down payments larger than in
the past. Perhaps in the long run that will reduce the huge number of
foreclosures that homeowners have been experiencing. According to RealtyTrac, an
organization that tracks nationwide foreclosures, in March alone there were
2,150 new foreclosure filings in the state. (For details, go to

The Technology Behind The MAP

BYLINE: Kevin Jepson

SECTION: TECHNOLOGY (AUTO); Pg. 16 Vol. 13 No. 11

LENGTH: 368  words


SAN DIEGO-The MAP at California Coast CU would be impossible but for the few
relatively simple reports configured by in-house programmers, according to Mitzi
Zarcone, SVP-lending and collections.

"We have Symitar programmers who create our reports that identify members who
are eligible for the MAP," said Zarcone. "But it wouldn't be that difficult for
other credit unions to create these custom reports."

California Coast uses PowerOn tools to dig into its Episys core system and
select members who aren't "severely" delinquent on their auto loans and have a
history of at least 30 months of timely payments, she continued. "We send them a
thank you note and offer to extend their loan out so they can have payment
relief." Episys and PowerOn are provided by Symitar, a Jack Henry & Associates
company.

The "MAP Select" report features the loan details for each member, including
account number; loan description, payment and balance; past due amount; last
payment date; number of days delinquent; any force placed insurance; and MAP
status.

The MAP monitoring report includes: account number; loan description and
balance; past due amount; unpaid interest; new MAP payment amount; last payment
date; number of days delinquent; and paper grade. Zarcone can sort the reports
by paper quality and number of days delinquent for all MAP loans.

"Tracking records are my friend," she said. "Some IT people hate me for the
records I require, but I need them to see how MAP loans are performing."

The ease of selecting members for MAP and tracking MAP loans would be impossible
without SymConnect, Symitar's application protocol interface, which enables
California Coast to pull its Equifax APPRO lending data into Episys, she added.

Additional custom Episys reports include: when MAP members were contacted; the
new MAP terms offered; when the member responded; loans that were reviewed but
failed to meet the MAP criteria; and MAP annotation in the original Episys loan
record.

Zarcone would like to see the technology extended to real estate loans, she
said. "But the mortgage part is a little more complex. The loans aren't all
serviced on Symitar companies. Hopefully we'll be able to build interfaces to
the servicers."

Tax talk for Putney Town Meeting Day

BYLINE: By HOWARD WEISS-TISMAN, Reformer Staff

SECTION: NEWS; Local

LENGTH: 555 words


PUTNEY -- Residents at Town Meeting are going to debate who pays taxes, who
should collect them when they are late and how much of a penalty there should be
for late filing.

The Town Meeting warning has four different articles concerning delinquent tax
collection, and a fifth article asking residents to consider reinstating a
business personal property tax.

The debate over delinquent taxes was brought up at the 2008 town meeting after
Putney resident Jacki Brook argued that the late fee was excessive.

After last year's town meeting a committee was formed to look at the existing
delinquent tax system in Putney.

The committee also compared it with other Vermont towns of similar size.

The committee presented its final report to the Selectboard last month and the
voters will have the final say on whether there will be changes to the
delinquent tax collection system in the coming year.

Putney currently has a collector of delinquent taxes, an office which is elected
by the voters.

Jill Garland is the collector of delinquent taxes and she is running for a
three-year term this year.

Both Weathersfield and Westminster, two towns with populations similar to
Putney's, collect delinquent taxes in house.

In Westminster the town finance officer collects late taxes, and in
Weathersfield they are collected by the administrative assistant.

The committee recommends that Putney change its system, but it said more
research should be done before a change is made.

Town manager Chris Ryan, at a Dec. 17 meeting, said he thought the job could be
handled by the existing staff at town hall.

The town will vote on the issue at Town Meeting and, if it is approved, the town
manager, or his designees, will take over the task after the current term
expires.

Putney charges an 8 percent penalty on the outstanding balance of taxes after
the final installment is due.

About $18,000 in fees are collected annually, which goes to the collector of
delinquent taxes.

If the collector's job is eliminated then that money would go into the town's
general fund.

The committee thinks the penalty should be reduced to 5 percent and the members
also want there to be a seven day grace period.

Town meeting attendees will consider the issue in two different questions.

Article 12 asks if there should be a grace period and article 13 considers
changing the penalty rate.

A final article asks Putney residents to consider establishing an annual salary
of $10,000 for the collector of delinquent taxes.

In a separate but related issue, Putney residents are also going to consider
reinstating the town's personal property tax.

The town voted to eliminate the tax in 2001, but lister Jonathan Wright wants
voters to consider once again taxing personal property.

In a letter to the Selectboard, Wright said the personal property tax has
historically made up 5 percent of the grand list and he estimates that between
$55,000 and $100,000 could be collected through the new tax.

"The town is missing a significant revenue source," Wright wrote in his letter.
"It's my hope that this will be an alternative to any increase in taxes or
ultimately a slight tax relief to the overburdened populous."

Putney's town meeting will be held on Tuesday, March 3, at 10 a.m. at the Putney
Central School.

BRIEF: Teen found delinquent in incident at Franklin Park Mall

BYLINE: The Blade, Toledo, Ohio

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 203 words


March 25--The 15-year-old Toledo boy suspected of shooting a gun in a Franklin
Park Mall parking lot admitted today to the charges filed against him.

The teen admitted in Lucas County juvenile court to inducing panic,
participating in a criminal gang, and carrying a concealed weapon. Judge Connie
Zemmelman found the youth delinquent and sentenced him to the Lucas County Youth
Treatment Center.

The youth will have to be assessed by the center to make sure he can benefit
from the treatment before he is admitted to the six-month lock-up facility.

The youth, a member of the Geer Gang Crips, shot a .42-caliber handgun -- which
he told the judge he purchased on the streets for $75 -- at members of the Manor
Boyz, a rival Bloods gang, on March 8 at about 9 p.m.

No injuries were reported but at least one vehicle was struck by a bullet, said
Lori Olender, an assistant Lucas County prosecutor who oversees the juvenile
division.

Ms. Olender said she could have filed a felonious assault charge with a gun
specification, but did not because the youth agreed to admit to the charges
against him.

$61,000 in taxes owed when BISD contract awarded

BYLINE: Emma Perez-Trevino, The Brownsville Herald, Texas

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 1008 words


Jul. 19--The day the Brownsville Independent School District awarded a
delinquent tax collection contract, some board members owed roughly $61,000
combined in past-due taxes to various governmental entities -- including the one
they were elected to represent.

The board on June 23 selected the firm of Pena & Associates, which was into the
second year of a two-year contract, to continue collecting delinquent taxes from
taxpayers.

Taxes owed by some board members involved real estate and gaming arcade
eight-liner equipment, Cameron County tax records show.

The board members with delinquent tax accounts as of June 23 were Richard "Rick"
E. Zayas, Ruben Cortez Jr., and Minerva Martinez Pena, no relation to the
collection firm.

Zayas' company, Snakre Vending LLC, owed $34,008.17 in delinquent taxes for the
1993 through 2006 tax years on 22.43 acres of land in Cameron County. Cortez
said he has an indirect interest in Snakre Vending because his and Zayas' Zaycor
Management Co. oversees Snakre.

After awarding the contract to Pena & Associates, Snakre Vending on June 26 paid
Cameron County, which collects current taxes for BISD and other entities, the
$34,008 owed on the acreage.

Tax records show that Snakre bought the property in 2005. Zayas said that when
Snakre bought the land, it came with a significant tax delinquency and that he
has been reducing the amount since then.

"I personally don't owe taxes," said Zayas, an attorney. Zayas said that the
companies and corporations owe the taxes instead.

Furthermore, $18,871 is owed in personal taxes for the Southwest Arcade Inc. and
Let It Ride Video Game operations at Pablo Kisel Boulevard and Southmost
Boulevard that Zayas and Cortez formed.

Delinquent taxes owed for the Southwest Arcade total $15,943 for the 2003
through 2005 tax years and $2,927 for the Let It Ride Video Game for the 2002
tax year.

Cortez also was past due $580 on a lot. Cortez, who said he had a payment
agreement with the county on this amount, paid off the amount July 10.

Martinez Pena's and her husband's accounts showed $7,116 past due on six
properties for the 2008 tax year when the board awarded the contract. An account
has since been paid and the amount was reduced to $6,855, public records show.

The BISD Board of Trustees, with the exception of member Catalina Presas-Garcia,
selected Pena & Associates, which tacks on a 12.5 percent collection fee to
delinquent taxpayers.

The firm also was the lowest that a BISD evaluation committee rated among four
firms. Linebarger Goggan Blair & Sampson LLP, which charges delinquent taxpayers
a 15 percent collection fee, was rated the highest.

"We have to look after the interests of our constituents," Zayas recently said
of why the board went with Pena & Associates.

Zayas said that the lower fee that Pena & Associates assesses "is the best thing
for the people. People have a hard time to begin with. We are trying to help
out."

Property tax accounts in Cameron County become delinquent Feb. 1 and starting
July 1, the delinquent accounts are turned over to the tax collection firm.

Zayas said that the gaming operations don't exist, anymore.

Cortez said that the Let it Ride Video Game had been an assumed name and that
this business operated under Southwest Arcade Inc., which is "defunct. There are
no assets. I'm not quite sure why it is still on the tax rolls."

Cortez continued: "If we owe money, we pay. We're not here to benefit from the
system. We are here to work properly for those (who are) supposed to benefit,
and those are the kids (in the school district)."

Public records show that the competing collection firm of Linebarger Goggan
Blair & Sampson LLP filed a tax lawsuit in state district court against
Southwest Arcade Inc. in January 2008 on behalf of Cameron County and the city
of Brownsville. Pena intervened or joined the lawsuit against Southwest Arcade
Inc. on BISD's behalf in September 2008. A judgment in the amount of $15,558 was
secured against Southwest Arcade and in favor of the county, city, and school
district in March this year. The amount continued unpaid as of Friday.

Martinez Pena was surprised to learn of the tax delinquencies, noting that she
would immediately look into it because the mortgage company was supposed to make
the payments. Martinez Pena has made arrangements with the tax firm, the firm's
office manager, Julio Lozano, said Friday.

Tax records show that board member Joe Colunga paid his taxes in April. "I
always try to be current and not let it go. I try to pay within a reasonable
time," Colunga said.

Rolando J. Aguilar, Dr. Enrique Escobedo and Presas-Garcia paid their taxes in
October, public records show.

Enrique Pena, owner of the tax collection firm, was not available to comment but
Lozano said that giving taxpayers some time to pay their taxes "doesn't mean
that we are protecting anyone."

"Rick (Enrique Pena) has sued a (family member). I've sued my (family members),"
Lozano said.

Insofar as the Linebarger firm filing a lawsuit to collect the Southwest Arcade
Inc. delinquency, Lozano said that the Linebarger firm "beat us to the punch."

Lozano said it is not unusual for tax firms to intervene in each other's
lawsuits filed on behalf of their clients. In this case, the Linebarger firm was
"quicker to the punch," Lozano said.

Regarding the 2002 year personal property taxes owed on the Let It Ride Video
Game, Lozano pointed to the Texas Property Tax Code, which provides that a
lawsuit cannot be filed to collect taxes on personal property that has been
delinquent more than four years.

Insofar as the responsibility to pay "that's a personal thing," Lozano said.

GSEs Complete Less Loan Mods in 1Q, REO Inventory Down

BYLINE: Evan Nemeroff

SECTION: MANAGING REO; Pg. 16 Vol. 16 No. 9

LENGTH: 517  words


Since the Federal Housing Finance Agency became the conservator of the
government-sponsored enterprises in the fourth quarter of 2008, nearly 2.3
million foreclosure prevention actions have taken place through the first
quarter of this year by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

According to the FHFA's quarterly foreclosure prevention report, more than 1.1
million permanent loan modifications have been completed in less than four
years. There has also been an additional 777,400 actions that resulted in a
distressed homeowner not losing their property to foreclosure. The FHFA said
339,000 of the actions were short sales and deeds-in-lieus, which resulted in
borrowers leaving their homes without going through the foreclosure process.

Through the first three months of this year, the enterprises completed
approximately 146,100 foreclosure prevention actions, including 60,300 permanent
loan modifications. But this is down by nearly 11,000 from the prior quarter.

In addition, about 44,600 repayment plans and 6,200 forbearance plans were
finalized to help delinquent borrowers cure their mortgage payments during the
quarter.

The FHFA said that half of all borrowers who received loan modifications in the
first quarter had their monthly payments reduced by over 30%, and one-third
included principal forbearance. Additionally, less than 15% of the borrowers who
had their loans modified nine months ago missed two or more payments.

The report also showed that third-party and foreclosure sales decreased
slightly, while foreclosure starts increased for the first time since the third
quarter of 2010. There were more than 226,000 foreclosure starts on Fannie Mae
and Freddie Mac loans by mortgage servicers in the first three months of 2012,
which is 8,000 more than the prior quarter but down substantially from the
all-time high of 339,000 experienced two years ago.

Meanwhile, completed sales went down quarter-over-quarter with approximately
79,000 foreclosed properties sold through March 2012, compared to 80,000 the
final three months of last year.

As of March 31, the enterprises' REO inventory declined as property dispositions
increased and acquisitions decreased. The inventory through the first quarter is
now at 173,000, compared to 179,000 in the prior quarter.

California has the most GSE bank-owned homes with 17,000, followed by Florida
with 15,000, Arizona has 5,000 and there are 3,000 in Nevada. Further, there are
47,000 properties in the Midwest, with the majority located in Illinois,
Indiana, Michigan and Ohio, while the remaining states have 86,000 REO homes
owned by the enterprises.

At the end of the first quarter, more than half of the 1 million serious
delinquent borrowers have missed more than one year of mortgage payments. In
Florida, there are over 162,000 loans that have been delinquent for at least a
year. According to the report, this figure exceeds the total number of loans
late in payment by 90 or more days in every other state except California.

Behind Florida, other states that had the most one-year delinquent mortgages
were New Jersey, Georgia, New York and Maine.

Ameren issues shut-off notice

Customers behind

$2,000 will be first

to have service cut

By Scott Miller

BLOOMINGTON - Ameren Corp. will start disconnecting the service of delinquent
customers on Thursday, as it sends the last of its rate-relief checks in the
mail.

The company hasn't disconnected any customers since January, when electricity
bills rose sharply as a state freeze on rates expired, said Ameren spokeswoman
Natalie Hemmer.

But the period to catch up with rising costs is over. Ameren will start
disconnections with customers who are three months delinquent, or about $2,000
behind, and proceed from there, Hemmer said. She wouldn't say how many customers
would be affected, though the company hasn't served public notice like this
before.

"Our goal is not to disconnect," she said. "Our goal is to get customers back on
track so they can make a payment arrangement."

Delinquent customers should contact the utility - AmerenIP, AmerenCILCO or
AmerenCIPS - immediately to arrange a deferred-payment plan.

Customers can also apply for state aid through Mid Central Community Action,
Hemmer said.

The Bloomington agency administers state-funded utility assistance grants for
low-income individuals, like the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or
LIHEAP, a one-time payment to cover utility costs.

Income guidelines vary. Individuals who make no more than $1,225 a month are
eligible for LIHEAP, for example, while families of four are eligible if they
have a household income under $2,500 per month, according to Community Action's
Web site.

The agency has more than $2 million available to assist residents in McLean and
Livingston counties.

The disconnections come as the St. Louis-based utility sends the last credit
checks to customers. Ameren previously agreed to give $140 million back to
customers in Central and Southern Illinois, per a deal hammered out with state
lawmakers to help ease the shock of rising electricity costs. About 935,000
customers were to get at least $100 back, Ameren said at the time.

Nearly all of those checks have been mailed or credited to customers' accounts,
Hemmer said. Other customers should receive credits this week.

"We will not be disconnecting any customers who have not received rate-relief
credits and are eligible to receive them," she said.

Provisions in the 1996 Farm Bill may bar struggling farmers from receiving
financing from the government and ultimately force many out of business. The
legislation eliminates continuation loans, or financing to producers who are
delinquent on their loan payments. It also bans the Farm Service Agency --
previously Farmers Home Adminstration -- from lending money to farmers who have
had their debt forgiven or restructured.

Officials in Washington, D.C., and North Dakota scrambled Thursday to find out
details, and solutions. ""This is big stuff,'' said N.D. Agricultural Mediation
Service Administrator L. Roger Johnson. ""When the farm bill was passed, there
were changes made to the credit title that were never really discussed much, if
at all, in public. And they are very drastic changes.'' The agency is known as
the lender of last resort for farmers who can't get financing elsewhere. The
changes were effective April 4. Many producers have suffered during the past few
years because of flooding or low cattle prices and may have become delinquent in
their payments. The agency reports about 1,200 delinquent borrowers in North
Dakota. And no one knows how each borrower will be affected by the changes.
""Some of these provisions are not real clear,'' Johnson said. ""Normally the
way things proceed, the law is passed and then the law is implemented by the
agency issuing regulations. All we've seen so far is the law, we haven't seen
any regulations.'' Those regulations won't be clear to the FSA's field staff
until mid-May, said Scott Stofferahn, the agency's state director. ""What is
really unfortunate if farmers had their paperwork in the office before April 4,
they have the whole year to find other financing,'' he said. ""If it was after
April 4, they're out of business.'' Many officials said it was unfair to single
out farmers who have had their debt restructured or forgiven, especially if they
are now current with their payments. And Stofferahn pointed out that the law
doesn't distinguish between a $500,000 and $10,000 debt. ""Abruptly pulling the
rug out from farmers at this very late date is terribly unfair,'' said Rep. Earl
Pomeroy, D-N.D., in letter to Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman. ""Many of
these farmers had every reason to expect they would receive loan funds and were
given no notice by USDA or anyone else that this was in jeopardy.'' Pomeroy was
also working on legislation to solve the problem. Rep. Larry Combest, R-Texas,
introduced a bill Monday that would delay the loan cutoff for 90 days.
Meanwhile, Johnson said the mediation service was willing to try to help farmers
with questions. But he cautioned that legislation may not solve the problem.
""How often does Congress act in less than 90 days?'' he said. ""If they don't
undo this real soon, then it's pointless.''

Pharr eyes delinquent tax attorney shake-up

BYLINE: Elizabeth Findell, The Monitor, McAllen, Texas

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 528 words


Jan. 04--PHARR -- City commissioners declined to replace delinquent tax
attorneys Linebarger Goggan Blain and Sampson last month, after considering a
report from the finance department that suggested the firm was failing to bring
in enough cash.

"I think that the city should keep Linebarger because we gave them a two-year
contract," Mayor Leo "Polo" Palacios said. "Some people say they're not
collecting enough money, but...some of those numbers are misleading. They
claimed they were doing OK."

Pharr leaders voted to hire Linebarger in October 2012, switching from Perdue
Brandon Fielder Collins & Mott. Since that time, collections in the city have
dropped.

A Dec. 17 memo from CFO Juan Guerra reported that the city had brought in at
least 35 percent of uncollected taxes every fiscal year since 2008, accounting
for more than $1 million each year.

But in fiscal year 2012-2013 they collected $711,000 -- only 28 percent of
delinquent funds.

The memo recommended the city switch back to Perdue. Linebarger did not answer
several calls to its Edinburg offices seeking comment.

"They're underperforming, but I think they still have time to catch up,"
Commissioner Jimmy Garza said. "Staff had some concerns, but I just didn't think
it was fair to get rid of them at this point."

The commission discussed the matter during a closed executive session, which is
not typically allowed for such subjects.

City Manager Fred Sandoval said they had acted on City Attorney Michael
Pruneda's advice that they could go behind closed doors to consider potential
legal issues. However, the Texas Attorney General's Office is clear that the
contract itself cannot be discussed in a closed setting.

"A governing body may consult with its attorney in a closed meeting to receive
advice on legal issues raised by a proposed contract. However, the body may not
discuss the merits of a proposed contract, financial considerations or other
non-legal matters related to the contract," the office says in a "Texas Open
Meetings Act Made Easy" publication.

Pruneda did not return calls to comment or explain the decision.

The commission apparently talked about Guerra's report, which laid out
collection numbers from the last few years, noting that other area cities
including McAllen, San Juan and Weslaco had all seen collections remain stable
or increase in the last year as Pharr's had decreased.

But city leaders noted that the delinquent tax pool had left slightly less from
which Linebarger could collect and that the first six months of the firm's work
had been an overlapping transition period with Perdue, when both were collecting
for the city.

"There was some disagreement back there, but I'm not able to discuss that --
that's why we go into executive session," Palacios said. "But we came to an
agreement we would take no action."

Guerra and Sandoval said they would be checking in frequently with Linebarger as
the firm tries to bring the collection rate up to 35 percent and would revisit
the status in another three months.

State needs to go big to protect kids

BYLINE: AUSTIN AMERICAN-STATESMAN

SECTION: EDITORIAL; Pg. E06

LENGTH: 763 words


High caseloads and high turnover continue to vex the state Child Protective
Service agency's efforts to investigate abuse and neglect allegations of Texas
children. And solutions to keep caseworkers on the job protecting children
aren't working effectively. Among the counties most affected by those dynamics
are Travis, Hays and Williamson. Backlogs in these Central Texas counties are at
chronic levels. The problem requires immediate attention from state leaders,
including Texas Health and Human Services Commissioner Dr. Kyle Janek, because
too many Texas children are at risk of being injured as their cases languish for
months without consideration.

CPS deserves credit for recognizing the problem and taking steps to solve it.
But last week, the public learned what CPS no doubt discovered during the past
few months - the remedy backfired.

To deal with massive backlogs in Travis, Midland and Ector counties, Child
Protective Services sent veteran caseworkers from Dallas and Houston to assist
those counties with unresolved cases left open for months, the Houston Chronicle
reported last week. The Chronicle reported that while delinquent cases in Travis
County dropped, from about 65 percent to 44 percent, the numbers for delinquent
child abuse investigation cases in Harris County jumped, to 1,470 cases, about
270 more delinquent cases than the county had a year ago before caseworkers were
dispatched to other counties.

Even with improvement, Travis County's backlog remains among the highest in the
state, a CPS official told us. As of last month, Travis County still is trying
to close 655 cases, down from over 1,200. But there is a continuing influx so
progress is slow. And other Central Texas counties, such as Williamson with
about a 50 percent delinquent rate, and Hays with a 43.5 percent delinquent
rate, are also at chronic levels. And the workload for frontline CPS
investigators in Region 7, which includes Travis, Williamson, Hays and Bastrop
counties, is the highest in the state, averaging 31.4 cases per worker. Such
pressures help explain why people bail out or burn out so quickly.

The problem of backlogs, however, is statewide. The Chronicle reported that "in
almost half the counties in Texas, one-third of the cases CPS investigators are
handling are 'delinquent.'"

A case is delinquent when it remains open for 60 days or more, says Patrick
Crimmins, a spokesman for CPS. The goal is to close a case within 30 days. Cases
that are open for 60 days or more can have serious consequences for children. It
means that CPS is not aware of what is going on with a child, family or
household for that period of time; that CPS has not made a finding about whether
the child is being abused or neglected; that CPS has not taken action to either
remove the child, provide the family with services to make the household safe
for the child or rule out the allegation.

"We need to get in and stay in or get in and get out - consistent with whatever
is safest for the child involved," Crimmins said.

We agree. But the system is broken because caseworkers are leaving the agency
faster than CPS can hire them. When they leave, their cases are assigned to
remaining caseworkers. So the workload for them quickly piles up to unmanageable
levels.

"The link between turnover, case­loads and backlogged cases is direct and it can
become a cycle," Crimmins said. "That is what we are seeing."

In August, for instance, CPS hired 65 investigators, but Crimmins said 73
workers left CPS that month. There are clues in a state survey of people who
left CPS jobs about why turnover is so high. The top reasons given are: working
conditions (about 24 percent cited that); retirement (16.2 percent); and jobs
that paid better (13.2 percent).

CPS has for several years tried to boost recruiting and retention efforts,
offering a $5,000 stipend to caseworkers and extra pay on top of base salaries
for certain skills, experience and education. But such incentives along with
starting salaries, which range from $2,644 per month to $2,970, are no longer
competitive enough to retain people in those high-pressure jobs.

A better solution might be found in the approach the state used a few years ago
to deal with a massive backlog in processing food stamps. The Texas Health and
Human Services Commission ramped up its hiring efforts, bringing on hundreds of
workers in a short span - upwards of 1,000 - revamped training and boosted pay.
Faced with a threat of losing millions of dollars in federal money, state
leaders went big. Surely they can do as much to protect Texas children.

Crackdown on water account delinquents showing results

BYLINE: John E. Usalis, Republican and Herald, Pottsville, Pa.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 490 words


May 25--ASHLAND -- The crackdown on delinquent water accounts in Ashland is
showing results, although apparently more people are concerned about having
their water service terminated than going to court.

During Monday's meeting of the Ashland Area Municipal Authority board, borough
Manager Thomas Joyce said notices were sent to delinquent customers of $400 and
more since the April meeting.

These customers were asked by the borough office to pay their accounts in full
or make arrangements for payments over time.

Before the meeting, the board received two lists of delinquents, one showing
customers with the larger delinquent accounts who could face civil actions filed
before the local magisterial district judge, and the other with customers facing
water service shutoffs.

"As you can see by the magistrate's list, there are very few who came in to pay
-- probably about six," Joyce said. "When you go to the shutoff list, it's quite
the opposite, with only about six who didn't come in to pay. A lot of them paid
in full, while a lot of them paid half and made arrangements. There are some who
didn't come in, and we're going to have to shut off their service."

Joyce said that notifications were sent about two weeks ago to those accounts
that were severely delinquent and could face court action, and those customers
were given until May 21 to contact the borough office to pay or make
arrangements.

Notices were mailed last week to those on the shutoff list. Customers on this
list were given three days to contact the borough office before water service
could be legally terminated, Joyce said.

The delinquent notices also included delinquent payments in the sewer and
sanitation accounts. The delinquents on the magisterial list who have not
responded will be forwarded to borough solicitor James Diehl, who will file
legal action on the six largest accounts. In about two weeks, another group of
legal actions will be filed on the next group of delinquents, Joyce said.

Any legal actions must be filed through the borough government, Joyce said,
because while AAMA owns the water system, treatment plant and reservoir, the
Borough of Ashland handles the day-to-day operations of the entire system --
including billing and collection -- through a management agreement between both
government entities dating back to the formation of the system in the early
1990s.

"We did collect quite a bit of money. There's a still quite a bit owed," Joyce
said.

Fayetteville officials seizing property from businesses that owe privilege
license fees

BYLINE: Andrew Barksdale, The Fayetteville Observer, N.C.

SECTION: BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS

LENGTH: 304 words


Dec. 13--The city of Fayetteville has taken the unusual step of seizing
furniture, computers and other property from businesses in arrears with their
privilege license fees.

Officials say they are so concerned about the safety of city employees that
police officers are accompanying the raids. City officials are releasing little
information about the delinquent business owners over fears they will be tipped
off by the media.

City officials said they are targeting business owners with the most amount of
money owed to the city -- and in some cases that's several tens of thousands of
dollars per account.

City officials said the first raid in late November was at an Internet
sweepstakes gaming parlor, and that more raids at delinquent business owners are
expected.

Last year, the city began charging $2,000 per gaming parlor and $2,500 for each
computer terminal. The fees can quickly add up for owners with multiple
terminals.

City Attorney Karen McDonald said state law allows cities broad authority to
enforce the collection of license fees, and one way is seizing and then selling
tangible property to pay off the delinquent levy.

"The city is aggressively pursuing the collection of privilege license fees,"
she said.

McDonald said seizing property from a delinquent business owner doesn't require
a warrant or court action. The city is taking the action only after other
attempts, including warning letters, to collect the money have failed, she said.

The action is not unprecedented. The city seized property for similar reasons in
the early 2000s, McDonald said.

Mississippi tops U.S. in mortgage payments late by 30 days in 4Q

BYLINE: Ted Carter

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 453  words


Mississippi led the nation in mortgage payments overdue by 30 days in the fourth
quarter and its 90-day delinquent rate began to resume a previous rise, the
Mortgage Bankers Association said in a press conference Thursday morning. The
state's overall rate of 13.30 percent was among the nation's highest, while the
5.93 percent 30-day tardy rate led even state's such as Florida, Nevada and
California, among the nation's most problem-plagued for residential real estate
loans. On the plus side, Mississippi's 60-day tardy rate of 2.43 percent and
late rate of more than 90 days, 8.35 percent, were well off the national leader
board.

The MBA says it is not entirely sure why Mississippi's 30-day delinquent rate
topped the nation. "We don't have any clear explanation for what is going on,"
said Mike Fratantoni, the MBA's VP for single-family research. "The typical
drivers are the unemployment rate and mix of loans," he said. A mix that
includes more traditional loans with adjustable rates can push the delinquent
rate upward as well. Also this quarter, an increase occurred in tardy Federal
Housing Administration loans. If the mix included a large number of FHA loans,
that could have helped to drive the tardy rate up, Fratantoni said. A colder
than normal winter could be contributing as well, according to MBA researchers,
who said that it is not unusual to see a rise in 30-day delinquencies as the
first winter heating bills come due in December. "Keeping the house heated tends
to take precedent," said Jay Brinkman, MBA chief economist. Home owners tend to
catch up on the payments in January, he said. Mississippi's delinquent mortgage
rate has been among the highest in the nation for nearly a decade, according to
the MBA. "If you go back to 2005, the pre-Katrina period, Mississippi ranked
among the highest delinquency rate," Brinkman said "So it's traditionally high.
" Nationwide, these latest delinquency numbers represent significant
across-the-board decreases in mortgage delinquency rates, Brinkman said. "Total
delinquencies, which exclude loans in the process of foreclosure, are now at
their lowest level since the end of 2008. Mortgages only one payment past due
are now at the lowest level since the end of 2007, the very beginning of the
recession. Perhaps most importantly, loans three payments (90 days) or more past
due have fallen from an all-time high delinquency rate of 5.02 percent at the
end of the first quarter of 2010 to 3.63 percent at the end of the fourth
quarter of 2010, a drop of 139 basis points or almost 28% over the course of the
year. Every state but two [Mississippi being one] saw a drop in the 90-plus day
delinquency rate and the two increases were negligible. "

Grand jury wants cuts at youth shelter;
Put delinquents at Orangewood, report urges.

BYLINE: By KEEGAN KYLE; The Orange County Register

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. Cover_A

LENGTH: 499 words


The Orange County grand jury recommended Tuesday that the county use up to half
of Orangewood Children's Home to help rehabilitate juvenile delinquents.

The panel said the county should study transferring the land and facilities to
the Probation Department for juvenile programs.

The report also said reducing Orangewood's staff and other cutbacks could save
the county millions of dollars, but how the grand jury came to that estimate is
unclear.

The number of abused, neglected or abandoned youths at Orangewood has dropped
over the last few years while the number of staff has remained steady, according
to the report. Orangewood is capable of housing 236 youths, but the facility
normally cares for fewer than 100.

"A reduction in the facilities and excess staffing of the Orangewood Children's
Home will save substantial dollars without compromising its care for abused,
abandoned or neglected children," the grand jury report says.

The grand jury recommended unused facilities at Orangewood be transferred from
the Social Services Agency to the Probation Department, which manages the
rehabilitation of delinquent youths. The details of the transfer and how the
Probation Department would use the land is unclear.

The grand jury made a point of calling Orangewood a "luxury" facility for
victimized children, adding that delinquent youth should receive equal treatment
from the county. The title of its report is, "They are all children."

During the past fiscal year, the Probation Department spent an average of $228
per child per day and Orangewood spent $739 per child per day, according to the
grand jury report.

County officials from Social Services and the Probation Department declined to
comment until an official response is presented to the Board of Supervisors in
90 days.

William Steiner, former director of Orangewood, said reducing the resources
available to abused or neglected children could be a risky move in an economic
recession.

"When you have unemployment pressures on families, the children sometimes become
the easiest targets," said Steiner, who now chairs the Orange County Juvenile
Justice Commission.

Robert Fellmeth, director of the Children's Advocacy Institute at the University
of San Diego, said the idea of taking resources away from dependent youth is
"laughable."

"Dependent youth have done nothing wrong, and the state is their parent,"
Fellmeth said. "They are strictly victims ... it's sensible that society feels
compelled to invest a little more in these people."

The Orangewood Children's Foundation was formed in 1981 to financially support
the shelter for dependent children, and the property was donated to the county
in 1985.

"The home is really there for the children in these times of crisis and was
really a gift from the community to the county," said Cal Winslow, the current
chief executive of the foundation. "To make a decision to use it in another way
would certainly make a lot of those people ... concerned."

Extensions granted to delinquent Pamlico taxpayers

BYLINE: Charlie Hall, Sun Journal, New Bern, N.C.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 400 words


Aug. 4--BAYBORO  -- More than 50 delinquent Pamlico County taxpayers with a
combined debt of $286,000 have received a 30-day extension to avoid foreclosure
procedures.

The Pamlico County commissioners granted the extra time Monday night, delaying a
request from the tax department to turn delinquent accounts -- with a balance of
more than $2,000  -- over to the county attorney's office.

Kathy Tyndall, the county  tax administrator, said Tuesday that tough economic
times may have played a role in the delinquent accounts and the same tight
economics forced the county to take extreme steps to collect its money.

"It is not a common thing," she said of the county foreclosing on delinquent
property owners. "We haven't had many go through the entire process."

She said the county's collection rate for 2008 was below normal, at 94 percent
of the levied $8.1 million due.

Letters foretelling possible foreclosure proceedings were sent July 28 to 77
property owners, with back taxes dating as far as 2000.

"Some are large land owners, with one that exceeds $50,000," Tyndall said.

Since the letters were mailed, 23 property owners responded either with full
payment or to set up a payment plan. About $31,000 has been collected.

Six letters were returned as having the wrong address and 57 others have not
responded.

Tyndall said it was the first time in her three-year tenure as tax chief that
foreclosure letters have been mailed. In the past, the most threatening letters
have warned delinquent taxpayers of impending enforced collection -- wage
garnishment, bank account attachments or debt setoff, which attaches the tax
bill to a state income tax return.

With the commissioners' decision to extend the time before turning the matter
over to attorneys, she said another letter will soon be in the mail.

"We will send another letter advising them we will give them until Sept. 8," she
said.

Attorney fees for the collection and foreclosure process will be billed to the
delinquent taxpayers.

BRIEF: Prestonsburg offers amnesty on delinquent taxes

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 225 words


Jan. 06--PRESTONSBURG -- As a new administration takes office, there is a
feeling of a new beginning in city hall. Now, Mayor Les Stapleton is extending
that feeling to taxpayers -- particularly those who have fallen behind.

The city of Prestonsburg has announced a tax amnesty program to allow delinquent
taxpayers a chance to get caught, without incurring interest or penalities.

"We're giving people a chance to get right with us, before we take any further
action," Stapleton said.

The amnesty period will run until Feb. 13 and extend to individuals and
businesses alike. Those bringing their taxes current before that date will see
all penalties and interest waived. After that date, delinquent accounts will
once again be subject to all interest and penalties.

Affected taxes include property taxes, hotel and restaurant restaurant sales
tax, employee withholding taxes, net profit taxes, alcohol regulatory taxes and
business license fees.

For more information or to inquire about account status, contact City Clerk
Sharon Setser at 606-886-2336.

EDUCATORS ACCEPT TOUGH TASK ... DELINQUENTS FIND GUIDANCE AT SCHOOL

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 1C

LENGTH: 822 words


Most teachers swell with pride when told that their best students want to become
entrepreneurs. But not at Griscom, St. Louis' only school for juvenile
delinquents.  Some of the 80-plus students there have committed murder, assault,
rape or robbery. When they talk about entrepreneurship - at least the kind many
of them have practiced on the street - their teachers worry.  Teacher Shirley
Alexander worries about 15-year-old Isaiah, a razor-thin 110-pounder who got
into business by selling $20 ''rocks'' of crack. Isaiah (not his real name) says
openly that he plans to become a big-time dealer.  The teachers work five days a
week to turn around Isaiah and the others.  But it isn't easy.  .  ''Stay in
line - stay in line!'' a detention officer barks at a student whose straying
violates one of the many rules of conduct at Griscom School, 3847 Enright
Avenue. ''Get back in line now!'' The other students in the line, all dressed in
blue two-piece uniforms, stop walking. The student who strayed leaps back in.  A
few minutes later the same detention officer stands inside a classroom.  She is
surrounded by three students, and she is angry.  ''Who started it?'' she asks.
No answer.  ''Who started it?'' ''I-I-I didn't,'' one stammers.  Another says,
''Let me - let me tell you how it started.'' That's life at Griscom, which is
operated by the St. Louis Public Schools.  Courts have sent some students to
Griscom because of family problems.  Almost all are the angry, emotionally
troubled products of neglect, abuse or disdain. Sometimes the anger spills over
classrooms, hallways or the lunch room.  Those who misbehave are marched down a
long, narrow hall to cells and ''locked down.'' Green steel doors, about an inch
thick, slam shut on these cells, which hold only a sink, a cot, a stool and a
mirror.  Tough? Yes. But such conditions let Griscom's teachers and
administrators try to reshape students' lives.  ''All of these kids have made
mistakes,'' says Principal Jimmie Mahan.  ''Our charge here is really just a
matter of helping each individual overcome that human capacity to err.'' He
admits that helping the students academically is an uphill chore. ''But if we
can prevent the student from losing ground, we'll be happy,'' he says.  .
Alexander, the teacher, has seen about 40 percent of her students return to
Griscom a second time - sometimes a third.  Among the second-timers is
16-year-old Grace (not her real name). She arrived the first time in January
1991 after an arrest for car theft.  She came back for failing to appear in
court on the car-theft charge and for violating probation.  ''I just got tired
of going to see my probation officer,'' she says. ''I've got a 2-year-old baby
to care for and a lot of other things to do. It got kind of hard trying to come
and see my probation officer.'' Grace says she realizes that most of the
teachers at Griscom are trying to help her.  ''They are good,'' she said. ''They
try to help you,'' Grace says. ''Some people try to put us down, but they try to
help us.'' That said, Grace spends no time thinking about life after Griscom.
''I don't think about stuff like that,'' she says. ''I'm going to take care of
my daughter, but I don't know what I'm going to do with my life.  ''It ain't
come to my mind yet. I just think about today, because I might not be here
tomorrow.'' .  That no-tomorrow attitude pervades Griscom, says Alexander.
''They have street smarts,'' she says. ''But they don't share academic knowledge
or any appreciation of its value to their lives.'' The optimist in Alexander
says some of the youngsters can turn their lives around. But she's honest enough
to know that for many, the future is bleak.  ''It frightens me,'' she says. ''I
don't see much of an outlet for many of them. I don't see much hope for them.''
Still, the teachers tell themselves that if they can save one, maybe they can
save another.  Maybe they can reach 15-year-old Tony, whose father died four
weeks ago, before Tony ever got a chance to meet him.  ''It makes me mad that I
never met him,'' says Tony. ''Maybe he could have helped me out. Maybe he could
have helped turn my life around.'' Tony (not his real name) is a thin teen-ager
with sloping, uneven shoulders. Like Isaiah, he was busted for selling crack.
''I started selling rocks because most of the things I wanted were expensive,''
Tony says. ''My mother works, but she doesn't make enough money to get the
things I wanted.'' He saved his money until he had $50 to buy six rocks of crack
from a small-time dealer. Tony turned around and sold the rocks for $20 each.
He kept investing in inventory; when an undercover police officer busted him, he
was carrying seven rocks.  Has he thought about life after Griscom? ''I don't
know what I'm going to be,'' he says with a smile. ''I haven't figured it out
yet. I don't want to work for somebody else. I want to own my own company.''

Md. Seeks Return On Tax Amnesty;
Delinquent Cases Told of Tougher Penalties

BYLINE: Paul W. Valentine, Washington Post Staff Writer

SECTION: MARYLAND WEEKLY (MONTGOMERY); PAGE M1

LENGTH: 842 words


Billing it as a "once-in-a-lifetime opportunity," Maryland this week launched
its long-awaited tax amnesty program, promising delinquent taxpayers who come
forward that they may pay their debts without fear of financial penalties or
criminal prosecution.

Officials, including Gov. William Donald Schaefer and Comptroller Louis L.
Goldstein, staged a series of promotional press conferences across the state,
including Silver Spring, urging compliance during the Sept. 1 through Oct. 31
amnesty period. They said the state hopes to recoup at least $ 20 million in
unpaid personal, corporate, sales and other taxes.

Amnesty "is simple . . . and it is fair," Goldstein said Tuesday in Baltimore .

But, Schaefer warned, if any delinquent taxpayers fail to come forward "we're
going to come after you."

Officials noted that much of the delinquent tax problem in Maryland is
concentrated in Montgomery County, where a large transient population of
Washington-based federal government employes, political appointees and private
lobbyists live for brief periods before moving back to their home states. The
officials said that many attempt to avoid paying Maryland taxes while living in
the county.

For those who don't come forward during the amnesty period, the chances of
getting caught afterward are greater and the consequences tougher, Goldstein
said. The comptroller's enforcement office has been beefed up with additional
audit and criminal investigation personnel, he said.

Penalties on outstanding income taxes will increase from 10 to 25 percent, he
said, and criminal sentences for amnesty-eligible taxpayers will jump from one
to five years' imprisonment and $ 1,000 to $ 5,000 in fines for each violation.

Although the state hopes to recover at least $ 20 million through the program,
officials said it is impossible to estimate how many delinquent taxpayers there
are in the state or how much they owe.

Modeled on recent amnesty programs in more than 20 other states, the Maryland
initiative grew out of legislation enacted earlier this year by the General
Assembly that would apply to taxpayers who owe any taxes that were due before
last Dec. 31.

Goldstein cautioned that unpaid 1986 personal income taxes do not come under the
program since the payment deadline for them is April 15, 1987. "The same goes
for sales taxes collected in December 1986, but due in January 1987," he said.

Payable taxes under the program include personal and corporate income taxes,
employer withholding taxes, retail sales and use taxes, admissions and amusement
taxes and boat excise taxes.

Taxpayers are eligible for amnesty if they filed no returns, filed returns for
deficient amounts or received a bill from the state for unpaid taxes, officials
said. Any taxpayer currently under state investigation is ineligible.

Under the amnesty program, new prosecutions and unpaid civil penalties would be
barred, but taxpayers still would have to pay accumulated interest on delinquent
taxes.

Taxpayers will be able to pay delinquent amounts by check, money order or credit
card, due by Oct. 31.

Initial efforts to publicize the amnesty program this summer got off to a rocky
start when information fliers depicting Chicago gangster Al Capone as a tax
evader drew complaints from leaders of the Italian-American community in
Baltimore.

The fliers were withdrawn and replaced by another depicting Lt. Col. George
Armstrong Custer, leader of a U.S. cavalry unit annihilated by Sioux Indians in
a battle on the Little Bighorn River in Montana in 1876. A caption on the flier
reads: "Custer was sure to beat the Indians. Are you sure you can beat Maryland
out of back taxes?"

Officials have distributed special tax amnesty payment forms throughout the
state. They are available at more than 1,200 banks, 230 libraries, 85 Giant Food
stores and at all 15 comptroller branch offices in the state and at the offices
of the clerks of the circuit courts for all 23 counties and the City of
Baltimore. In addition, special boat excise tax forms are available at the five
branch offices of the state Department of Natural Resources.

Tax experts also will be available on special telephone lines set up to provide
information and other assistance. The main number is 1-800-MDTAXES, along with a
separate Department of Natural Resources number, 1-800-492-1138, for boat excise
tax information. TAX AMNESTY INFORMATION

Fewer Fall Delinquent In Paying Mortgages

BYLINE: By DAVID STREITFELD

SECTION: Section B; Column 0; Business/Financial Desk; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 794 words


Even as the fight over foreclosures continues, the high tide of delinquency
among homeowners has begun to recede.

Households that are behind in their mortgage payments fell during the third
quarter to 13.52 percent, from 14.42 percent in the second quarter, the Mortgage
Bankers Association reported on Thursday.

It was the lowest delinquency rate since the beginning of 2009, just as the
financial crisis began hitting home. The new data come amid stepped-up scrutiny
of foreclosures by state and federal authorities, prompted by revelations that
the banks have been pursuing them in ways that could violate the law.

Delinquencies during the summer months declined for two reasons. Bankers reduced
the pool of the seriously delinquent by offering loan modifications to some and
evicting others. Seriously delinquent mortgages -- those that are three months
overdue or more -- fell during the third quarter to 8.70 percent of all loans,
from 9.11 percent in the second quarter, the bankers' group said.

An economy that stopped deteriorating also had a positive effect. The percentage
of borrowers that missed their first mortgage payment dropped in the third
quarter, both from the second quarter and from the third quarter of 2009.

Just as the third quarter was ending in September, however, an uproar over
foreclosure documentation began. Under pressure, several lenders suspended
foreclosures so they could review their procedures.

Until those reviews are completed, analysts said, the number of households in
the latter stages of delinquency is likely to swell again, meaning it is too
early to know whether the third-quarter data signals a longer-term trend.

The report ''is clearly good news, but perhaps we should wait'' another quarter
before concluding that the delinquency decline is permanent, said Jennifer H.
Lee of BMO Capital Markets.

Lender Processing Services, a mortgage data company, also suggested caution in a
separate report this week, saying the number of properties in delinquency and
the number in foreclosure edged up in October from September.

Even with the third-quarter drop, delinquencies and foreclosures are above
normal. They are closely tied to the employment situation, which is no longer
worsening but not getting much better, either.

The delinquency survey on Thursday came out during a second day of Congressional
hearings this week on foreclosures, with five major banks testifying. The banks
tried to emphasize they were changing their ways, statements that were met with
some skepticism.

''There is significant evidence to suggest that the speed-driven, corner-cutting
operations endemic in the mortgage servicing industry have produced systemic and
damaging consequences for the nation's homeowners and for our housing and
financial markets,'' said Representative Maxine Waters, the California Democrat
who is chairwoman of the House Subcommittee on Housing and Community
Opportunity.

Elizabeth A. Duke, a Federal Reserve Board governor, said in her testimony that
the central bank expected about 2.25 million foreclosure filings this year and
in 2011, and two million more in 2012.

''They will remain extremely high by historical standards,'' Ms. Duke said in
her prepared testimony. In 2006, before the collapse, there were about one
million foreclosures a year.

It is evident from the third-quarter data that foreclosures are no longer being
caused by bad loans, which was the case for much of the recession. Now most
foreclosures occur with prime loans, which are harder for banks to modify than
subprime.

Prime fixed-rate loans, the safest kind of loans, represented 36 percent of all
new foreclosures in the third quarter, up from 30 percent in the third quarter
of 2009. Meanwhile, the percentage of new foreclosures generated by the worst
kind of loans, adjustable subprime, fell sharply.

The Treasury Department also released its most recent loan modification figures
on Thursday, showing that only 24,000 households had gotten permanent new loans
during October. It was the lowest number since the government's Making Home
Affordable Program was getting started last year.

About 483,000 homeowners have gotten permanent new loans through the program;
719,000 enrolled in a trial but were either foreclosed or got a modification
without government oversight.

Bank of America said that it modified 25,000 loans in October, up from 16,500 in
September. Relatively few were done through the government program.

Michael Fratantoni, vice president of research for the mortgage bankers, said,
''The modification effort has certainly benefited a number of homeowners.'' But
he noted that the re-default rate of modified loans can be as high as 50 percent
after the first year, another reason foreclosures are unlikely to decline
significantly.

Bank of America's Next Big Countrywide Problem

BYLINE: Kate Berry

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 9 Vol. 18 No. 11

LENGTH: 804  words


Two hundred sixty-three thousand.

Of all the numbers that have been batted around about the legacy of Bank of
America's ill-fated Countrywide acquisition since the bank's big Justice
Department settlement, that's the one to keep in mind going forward.

Brian Moynihan & Co. have attacked with gusto B of A's delinquent-loan portfolio
in recent years, much of which came from the 2008 acquisition of Countrywide.
But even after all that work - the chargeoffs, the loans sales, the
renegotiations - the bank still has 263,000 delinquent loans on its books.

B of A has estimated that it will get back to a normal level of delinquent loans
within two years, but that may be optimistic. Most of the loans it has left
probably cannot be sold, and working out problem loans - especially those at the
bottom of the barrel - is notoriously slow and labor intensive, analysts say.

"In later stages, the numbers are harder to move down," said Chris Mutascio, an
analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.

Such a daunting challenge are fresh reminders of what everyone has known for
years: Bank of America's purchase of Countrywide Financial in 2008 was a bad
deal.

Estimates of exactly how bad have varied, but the Charlotte, N.C., bank has
pegged total losses from the ill-fated acquisition at more than $63 billion over
the past six years. That tally includes its purchase price, mortgage repurchase
claims, litigation and settlements, loan-loss provisions and chargeoffs on
residential loans and home equity lines of credit.

It's hard to find any silver lining - much harder than even JPMorgan Chase's
acquisition of Washington Mutual, which was a big reason for its $13 billion
settlement agreement with Justice last year but still gave the bank a big
presence on the West Coast.

B of A can't even take satisfaction in the retail network it gained. It acquired
1,000 field offices from Countrywide, but it has since had to shut down many of
them.

Countrywide "has been all cost and zero benefits" for Bank of America, said
Isaac Boltansky, a policy analyst at Compass Point Research & Trading.

B of A also received a $1.5 trillion servicing operation, including a portfolio
of nine million loans, but the cost to service the legacy loans has far exceeded
revenues because of the portfolio's high delinquency rates, analysts say.

Moynihan, B of A's chief executive since 2009, has sold off more than a trillion
dollars of nonperforming loans, mostly to nonbank servicers in response.

But there is still a lot of work ahead.

B of A has reduced its residential servicing portfolio to $760 billion as of
June 30, down 23% from a year earlier. That's a far cry from the end of 2008,
when B of A oversaw more than $2 trillion in mortgages.

There have been some complications in the transfer of mortgage servicing rights
to other entities.

Ginnie Mae has cracked down on servicers like B of A for selling some delinquent
loans without having all the necessary documents including a proper title.

Problems with missing documents resurfaced this year in a program Ginnie created
before the mortgage crisis. The program allowed large servicers to quickly
transfer servicing rights if they agreed to send the essential records of the
mortgage, deed of trust, title policy and other documents within roughly a year.

If loans lack proper documentation, B of A may be stifled in trying to unload
any more nonperforming loans.

As a result, the work ahead largely involves whittling down the 263,000
delinquent loans remaining in its legacy book. They are valued at $38 billion.

The bank has established a reserve based on loan performance so it's unclear how
much in additional losses it would have to take on these loans.

The good news for B of A is that it has 81% fewer delinquent loans than the 1.4
million it held in the fourth quarter of 2010, at the height of the housing
crisis.

"They're been aggressive, but they had to be given the costs," Mutascio said.

"They sold some delinquent servicing, housing prices have gone up so losses have
been reduced, and the overall economy has improved."

Still, B of A is stuck with perhaps the largest number of delinquent loans of
any bank, analysts and servicing executives say.

Some of the delinquent borrowers can be refinanced or nursed back to health with
loan modifications. Many will end up in a short sale, deed-in-lieu or
foreclosure.

Moynihan said on a second-quarter conference call that reducing the number of
delinquent loans and legacy costs to a normal level of $500 million a quarter is
a major goal. Legacy servicing costs were $1.4 billion in the second quarter,
down from $2.3 billion a year earlier.

"They believe they can get quarterly costs on servicing down to a normal level
by late 2015 or perhaps early 2016," Mutascio said. "They've done a pretty good
job of late but they have a year or two more to get there."

Bank of America's Next Big Countrywide Problem

Two hundred sixty-three thousand.

Of all the numbers that have been batted around about the legacy of Bank of
America's ill-fated Countrywide acquisition since the bank's big Justice
Department settlement, that's the one to keep in mind going forward.

Brian Moynihan & Co. have attacked with gusto B of A's delinquent-loan portfolio
in recent years, much of which came from the 2008 acquisition of Countrywide.
But even after all that work - the chargeoffs, the loans sales, the
renegotiations - the bank still has 263,000 delinquent loans on its books.

B of A has estimated that it will get back to a normal level of delinquent loans
within two years, but that may be optimistic. Most of the loans it has left
probably cannot be sold, and working out problem loans - especially those at the
bottom of the barrel - is notoriously slow and labor intensive, analysts say.

"In later stages, the numbers are harder to move down," said Chris Mutascio, an
analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.

Such a daunting challenge are fresh reminders of what everyone has known for
years: Bank of America's purchase of Countrywide Financial in 2008 was a bad
deal.

Estimates of exactly how bad have varied, but the Charlotte, N.C., bank has
pegged total losses from the ill-fated acquisition at more than $63 billion over
the past six years. That tally includes its purchase price, mortgage repurchase
claims, litigation and settlements, loan-loss provisions and chargeoffs on
residential loans and home equity lines of credit.

It's hard to find any silver lining - much harder than even JPMorgan Chase's
acquisition of Washington Mutual, which was a big reason for its $13 billion
settlement agreement with Justice last year but still gave the bank a big
presence on the West Coast.

B of A can't even take satisfaction in the retail network it gained. It acquired
1,000 field offices from Countrywide, but it has since had to shut down many of
them.

Countrywide "has been all cost and zero benefits" for Bank of America, said
Isaac Boltansky, a policy analyst at Compass Point Research & Trading.

B of A also received a $1.5 trillion servicing operation, including a portfolio
of nine million loans, but the cost to service the legacy loans has far exceeded
revenues because of the portfolio's high delinquency rates, analysts say.

Moynihan, B of A's chief executive since 2009, has sold off more than a trillion
dollars of nonperforming loans, mostly to nonbank servicers in response.

But there is still a lot of work ahead.

B of A has reduced its residential servicing portfolio to $760 billion as of
June 30, down 23% from a year earlier. That's a far cry from the end of 2008,
when B of A oversaw more than $2 trillion in mortgages.

There have been some complications in the transfer of mortgage servicing rights
to other entities.

Ginnie Mae has cracked down on servicers like B of A for selling some delinquent
loans without having all the necessary documents including a proper title.

Problems with missing documents resurfaced this year in a program Ginnie created
before the mortgage crisis. The program allowed large servicers to quickly
transfer servicing rights if they agreed to send the essential records of the
mortgage, deed of trust, title policy and other documents within roughly a year.

If loans lack proper documentation, B of A may be stifled in trying to unload
any more nonperforming loans.

As a result, the work ahead largely involves whittling down the 263,000
delinquent loans remaining in its legacy book. They are valued at $38 billion.

The bank has established a reserve based on loan performance so it's unclear how
much in additional losses it would have to take on these loans.

The good news for B of A is that it has 81% fewer delinquent loans than the 1.4
million it held in the fourth quarter of 2010, at the height of the housing
crisis.

"They're been aggressive, but they had to be given the costs," Mutascio said.

"They sold some delinquent servicing, housing prices have gone up so losses have
been reduced, and the overall economy has improved."

Still, B of A is stuck with perhaps the largest number of delinquent loans of
any bank, analysts and servicing executives say.

Some of the delinquent borrowers can be refinanced or nursed back to health with
loan modifications. Many will end up in a short sale, deed-in-lieu or
foreclosure.

Moynihan said on a second-quarter conference call that reducing the number of
delinquent loans and legacy costs to a normal level of $500 million a quarter is
a major goal. Legacy servicing costs were $1.4 billion in the second quarter,
down from $2.3 billion a year earlier.

"They believe they can get quarterly costs on servicing down to a normal level
by late 2015 or perhaps early 2016," Mutascio said. "They've done a pretty good
job of late but they have a year or two more to get there."

Drink-tax delinquents headed to court

BYLINE: Tim Puko

LENGTH: 473 words


Allegheny County is going to court to collect more than $450,000 from bar owners
yet to pay the drink tax.

The county Treasurer's Office last month began suing 18 bars and restaurants
with some of the longest outstanding debts. They could be in court within weeks
for not paying the 10 percent tax on poured alcoholic drinks, county Treasurer
John Weinstein said. Beginning today, the tax drops to 7 percent.

"Believe me, we've tried multiple times and we've been so patient and diligent
with them," Weinstein said. "Some of them just ignore the certified letters.
Some will hang up on the phone calls if they have caller ID."

The county has fewer than 40 bars remaining on its delinquents list, Weinstein
said. He and an attorney he hired to handle the cases broke them into two groups
to keep from overburdening the court, they said.

County officials know the exact amount owed by only two bars. Sports Rock Cafe
in the Strip District owes $75,237.10, according to court documents. Woody's
Bar, on Glass Run Road in Hays, owes $3,343. Representatives of Sports Rock and
Woody's could not be reached.

The other bars have yet to tell the county how much money they made, so county
workers cannot calculate the tax owed. The county is asking for delinquent taxes
and fines.

Not knowing revenue for the bars is the county's biggest challenge in pursuing
owners, said Howard J. Schulberg, a Downtown attorney and former Pittsburgh
solicitor Weinstein hired for the cases.

"I don't know how successful these bars are, or if they are successful," he
said. In those cases, the county is asking for unspecified damages in excess of
$25,000.

Initially, 53 bars had not paid the drink tax for at least one month after the
county implemented it in January 2008. A few paid after Weinstein released a
scofflaws list in October. A second group of lawsuits to address the rest of the
delinquent payers possibly will be filed by February, Weinstein said.

Those who have not paid can be fined $300 per month and sentenced to jail for up
to 90 days for each month of nonpayment, Weinstein said. He is willing to
withdraw the court challenge for any of the delinquents who want to pay now, he
said.

The drink tax was implemented along with a $2-a-day surcharge on rental cars to
create steady funding for Port Authority. The taxes brought in more than $36
million through October, according to Weinstein's office.

That's $9 million more than needed, and county officials expect the excess to
rise to $12 million. County lawyers will be in court this week to argue about
spending the extra money.

A group of restaurateurs and Councilman Charles P. McCullough sued to stop the
county from spending the excess money on road and bridge projects. Common Pleas
Judge Judith F. Olson could announce a decision Friday on a request for an
injunction in the case.

Shawnee County sells delinquent parcel for $50

BYLINE: Aly Van Dyke.

LENGTH: 519 words


Shawnee County on Thursday sold a small, landlocked delinquent parcel for $50.

The 9-foot-wide parcel didn't sell at a recent tax sale, county counselor Rich
Eckert said, and has no use other than to the person who offered to buy it. In
fact, the property on S.E. 29th only is accessible to David Petty's property,
4834 S.E. 29th St., or a neighbor's property at 4828 S.E. 29th.

"A fair amount of the time, the one entity that could actually use the property
never puts a bid on it," Eckert said. "Mr. Petty was kind enough to take this
burden from us."

Petty thanked the Shawnee County Commission for approving the sale Thursday. The
parcel, he said, will bring his property up to three acres.

"It gives me the rest of my property back," Petty said.

A second sale - a 55-by-135-foot parcel at 902 S.E. to the Eastside Church of
God in Christ for $125 - was deferred so it could be placed into a sealed bid.

"We found out we never put that into a sealed bid," Eckert said. "So we will
follow state statute on that."

The county acquired both properties at an April 13, 2011, foreclosure sale.

Eckert indicated his office was gearing up for another tax sale, reminding the
community that the county only can start to pursue residential properties after
they have been delinquent for three years. Once the process is started, he said,
taking the property to a tax sale requires at least another nine to 18 months.

"It might be urgent" to people living next door to delinquent lots, he said,
"but the law requires us to jump through these hoops. I know some people are
frustrated. We're constantly watching those taxes. We're fairly up-to-date. I
feel really good about our process."

The commission on Thursday also considered awarded a $704,878.30 bid to King
Construction Co. to replace the S.W. Docking Road Bridge over Mission Creek. The
company isn't in Shawnee County - it is located in the south-central Kansas town
of Hesston - but it was the only contractor to bid for the project, said public
works director Tom Vlach.

Vlach also offered a few clarifications from Tuesday's Topeka City Council
meeting, when the council discussed half-cent sales tax extension projects.

The N.W. Carlson Road Bridge isn't quite at the rating that would make the
county eligible for federal replacement funds, but even if that does happen, it
just means the bridge is eligible, not that it would be guaranteed funding, he
said.

Also, he said, the county has three bridge projects left on this current sales
tax. It has many more bridges that still require repair and replacement.

Vlach also presented statistics from the county's Household Hazardous Waste
facility, which finished out its fiscal year Monday.

Nearly 4,200 people dropped off items at the facility this year - almost 1,000
more than last year and double the amount from 2010.

"We shattered our record of participation," he said. "I never would have
anticipated numbers like this."

Vlach attributed the spike to information handed out during the start of
curbside recycling started January 2013.

"I think this is a bonus from the recycling program," Commissioner Bob Archer
said.

Girls' home application stalls;
West Manchester plan on hold for research

BYLINE: By WENDI HIMMELRIGHT Dispatch/Sunday News

SECTION: LOCAL

LENGTH: 445 words


Plans to open a home for delinquent girls on West Market Street in West
Manchester Township are on hold while an attorney for a local youth ministry
researches the zoning ordinance.

Mission Home Ministries sought to have the home considered a medical facility,
which would be permitted in a commercial zone, but a zoning application has been
withdrawn.

Mission Home Ministries operates several facilities in York County, including
Believers Fellowship Church at 1000 S. Queen St., a school for troubled youth on
West Philadelphia Street, an alternative educational program for elementary
students at the Loretta Claiborne Building on South George Street and group
homes for delinquent youth in Springettsbury Township and Mount Wolf.

The organization has received approval and is about to open a group facility for
delinquent girls at the former Seven Valleys Elementary School and for dependent
shelter youth, not declared delinquent by the courts, on West Broadway in Red
Lion.

The Rev. Keith Beatty, owner of MHM, said he would also like to open a home at
4185 W. Market St. in West Manchester Township for 16 adjudicated delinquent
girls ages 9 to 18.

"We are looking at this one on West Market, because it would fit the needs of
the kids. We really specialize in working with girls. And there just seems to be
more of a need for girls' programs," Beatty said.

The 21/2-story, 25,000-square-foot vacant house on West Market Street is zoned
commercial. On behalf of MHM, Garland Construction of Lancaster submitted a
zoning application asking if a group home could be considered a medical
facility, which is allowed in a commercial zone.

The application requested that overnight housing at the home be considered
incidental to the counseling aspect of the facility.

West Manchester Township zoning officer David Unger said the application was
withdrawn after the hearing Oct. 23, before the board issued an opinion.

"Based on the questions the zoning hearing board asked, it was apparent they
were not willing to agree with the interpretation that this was going to be a
medical facility," Unger said.

Bill Andring, attorney for MHM, said there may be another way to get permission
for a girls' home, though he declined to say whether he would ask for a
variance.

"We aren't negotiating with anybody. Either you are allowed to put it there or
you're not," Andring said.

"It's a nice facility. It really seems to be made for something like this. I'm
reviewing the ordinance to see if there are other provisions we can proceed
under."

Andring said Garland Construction owns the property, and MHM plans to lease it
if a home for girls is approved.

BRIEF: Teen minivan driver found delinquent of vehicular manslaughter

BYLINE: Jennifer Feehan, The Blade, Toledo, Ohio

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 165 words


Feb. 25--BOWLING GREEN -- A teen driver who crossed the center line and struck
an oncoming minivan killing all four of its occupants last year was found
delinquent today of vehicular manslaughter.

At a hearing in Wood County Juvenile Court, Nicholas Korducki, now 17, of
Bowling Green, admitted to the offense, which stemmed from a Feb. 5, 2015, crash
on State Rt. 25 north of Bowling Green.

The driver of the van, Kenneth Johnston, 71, and his wife, Diane Jacobs, 64,
both were killed in the crash, while two other passengers, Ms. Jacob's parents,
Donna Jacobs, 85, and Harley Jacobs, 88, later died from their injuries.

Visiting Judge Michael Bumb ordered the Korducki youth to serve seven days in
the Wood County Juvenile Detention Center, perform 100 hours of community
service and pay a $200 fine. The judge also suspended his driver's license for
two years.

$4 million in unpaid property taxes owed

NEW HANOVER COUNTY | New Hanover County property owners with delinquent tax
accounts owed a total of $4 million on about 4,200 parcels as of Monday morning.

The list includes businesses, individuals, corporations and even the state,
which owes a total of $42.42 on four parcels. The outstanding balances range
from $2.62 to $73,644.82.

New Hanover's collection rate is 98.4 percent. Although the county plans for
outstanding balances with the knowledge that it won't collect everything, the
more that's collected, the better it is for everyone.

Property tax bills became delinquent on Jan. 6. The tax department sent more
than 8,600 delinquent notices. As of Monday morning, property owners still owed
money on 4,212 parcels.

Last year in early March, there were 4,952 parcels left on the list for a total
of $5.7 million in uncollected taxes.

YMCA works to repair facility, has bigger plans

WILMINGTON | More than one month after an accidental fire from a sauna badly
damaged the second story of the Wilmington Family YMCA building at 2710 Market
St., administrators are beginning to consider possible new amenities at the
facility while simultaneously working to rehab a temporary workout space.

YMCA CEO Dick Jones said Wednesday he still does not have a cost estimate for
the damage, but he does know administrators can bring back two key parts of the
Y building within the next 30 days. The board will decide in April how to go
forward with plans it had in place before the fire - plans to renovate the YMCA
and bring big changes, Jones said.

Though it will be at least a year before the whole building can reopen, he said
the first order of business is bringing back the six-lane pool and gymnasium in
the next 30 days.

Brunswick board hires Tubb as superintendent

BRUNSWICK COUNTY | The Brunswick County Board of Education voted 4-1 Tuesday to
appoint Les Tubb superintendent.

Board member John Thompson had the dissenting vote and said his decision was not
a reflection of his perspective of Tubb, but was instead a challenge to the
board that it has a lot of improvements to make.

"It's one of the most important things that we do to put the right
superintendent in place," he said. "For now, Mr. Tubb is our superintendent.
I'll be working hard to support him and hopefully move the school system
forward."

Tubb has served as interim superintendent since Edward Pruden was fired in
November.

After advertising the position nationwide for eight weeks, the board received
applications from 39 candidates.

Number of unclaimed bodies spikes in county

SOUTHEASTERN N.C. | The New Hanover County Department of Social Services has
paid for the disposition of 13 unclaimed bodies so far this fiscal year, a 30
percent increase over the previous fiscal year and more than in any of the
previous eight fiscal years.

Transients could be behind the spike in unclaimed bodies, said Wanda Marino,
assistant director for New Hanover County DSS.

"I think it's also people move here and they want to be at the beach - it's
warmer - and they lose contact with their extended family," Marino said.
"Sometimes, it's not that people are just not kind or not being considerate.
They really don't have the resources to take care of their loved one."

The county DSS office has a budget of $5,000 a year to pay for the disposition
of unclaimed bodies and contracts with Wilmington Funeral and Cremation to
transport and cremate the bodies at $500 each. So far this year, expenses exceed
the budget by $500.

Vigo County tax sale generates just over $1 million

BYLINE: Howard Greninger, The Tribune-Star, Terre Haute, Ind.

LENGTH: 354 words


Oct. 17--A county property tax sale Thursday collected $1,002,577 in delinquent
taxes and penalties, Vigo County Auditor Tim Seprodi said.

The county holds a one-day "A sale" annually in October. A certificate sale is
done in the spring. Unlike Thursday's sale, the certificate sale lasts more than
10 days and includes online bidders.

Properties whose owners have delinquent taxes in three consecutive taxing
periods are placed into the sale, Seprodi said.

The county had 1,002 properties with $3.322 million in delinquent taxes and
penalties due. "We had 155 properties that were sold. That is pretty low, and we
had a low turnout at the sale this year," Seprodi said. "We usually sell about
25 to 30 percent of the properties. This time we sold about 15 percent. Also, we
only had 34 bidders when we usually have 50 or more."

The highest property, a home on Oregon Church Road, sold for $213,000. The
minimum bid, which is the amount owned in taxes and penalties, was $7,300. The
second highest property sold for $90,000 for a home on Harlan Drive, which had a
minimum bid of $2,300, Seprodi said. Another home sold for $57,000, with a
minimum bid of $6,058.

Property owners have 12 months to pay back taxes, plus a 10-percent penalty as
well as other fees to redeem their sold properties, the auditor said. The buyer
of a sold property receives a 10-percent interest payment based on the minimum
bid and is reimbursed the sale price by the county, Seprodi said.

Seprodi said the sale is a method to attempt to return property to the county's
tax roll. Seprodi said officials with SRI Inc., which managed the tax sale, said
such property tax sales are down statewide. "I would imagine it is tied to the
economy," the auditor said.

Vigo County annually collects 93 to 97 percent of all property taxes owed before
a tax sale is conducted, Seprodi said. The county paid $15,805 to SRI to conduct
the sale.

Cracking down on delinquent state taxpayers

BYLINE: By Harrison Sheppard, MEDIANEWS STAFF

SECTION: LOCAL; Tribune; Times-Star

LENGTH: 785 words


SACRAMENTO -- As yet another tax season approaches, California officials are
cracking down on cheats and delinquent payers -- estimated at more than 750,000
across the state -- who owe billions of dollars from 2006 alone.

With the state facing a massive budget crisis, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger is
proposing more funding to hire 500 new tax collections and investigations
personnel that could generate at least $126 million in net revenue for state
coffers.

State tax agents have begun posting the names of the biggest delinquents online
in an effort to capture more revenue.

"We're working really hard on the underground economy and trying to find people
who are evading taxes or getting paid under the table and not filing taxes on
that income," said Franchise Tax Board spokeswoman Holly McDonell.

McDonell estimated a $6.5 billion "tax gap" in California -- the difference
between state income taxes owed and paid.

The state estimates the number of nonfilers by reviewing people who filed
federal returns with a California address, but did not file state returns.
Officials also cross-check other financial information such as mortgage payments
and vehicle registrations as well as gather information through a toll-free tip
line.

Tax enforcement may be one of the few areas that will receive a funding boost
next year as the state faces a $14.5 billion budget deficit.

Schwarzenegger has proposed 10 percent across-the-board cuts for most state
agencies and programs, but he also proposed funding increases for more than a
dozen programs related to tax collection and fraud investigation.

"With the current budget crisis, these are important measures to increase
revenues tothe general fund, at a time when we need it the most," administration
spokesman Bill Maile said. "The benefits clearly outweigh the costs. We need to
target non-compliance, and the underground economy, and be as effective as
possible in collecting taxes owed to the state."

One proposal calls for 106 new state workers to identify businesses that operate
without a permit and therefore evade payment of sales and use tax. Officials
estimate that new enforcement could generate $37.9 million in revenue.

Other proposals include an additional 15 investigators to look into people who
register vehicles worth at least $40,000 but do not file a personal-income tax
return; 27 positions to cross-check IRS records for people who file federal
returns but not state returns; and 32 positions to investigate fraudulent claims
for dependents and child care credits and other refunds.

Another 15 positions would investigate leads generated from border inspection
stations on businesses that may be importing goods without paying the
appropriate taxes.

State Controller John Chiang, chairman of the Franchise Tax Board, said that
during previous lean budget years the state had to cut its tax enforcement staff
-- which may have been counterproductive to the state's financial interest.

Still, he said, the state has approved new programs such as increased use of
electronic filing and additional seminars for businesses and non-English
speakers. The tax board also recently launched a new program to go after big tax
shelters that may have helped wealthy taxpayers illegally avoid paying tens of
millions of dollars in taxes.

Chiang acknowledged that going after every transaction in the underground
economy would be expensive and nearly impossible. But state agents don't have to
investigate every business for the word to get out.

"We would audit some of the businesses. That information gets shared," Chiang
said. "We hope to bring in significant dollars."

Some economists say it is likely the state will never develop effective
mechanisms to collect taxes from the underground economy because it is so big.

Jack Kyser, chief economist of the Los Angeles County Economic Development
Corp., said Los Angeles in particular -- with its diverse population and
spread-out territory -- hosts a large underground economy that includes taco
trucks on Olympic Boulevard, day laborers in front of Home Depot and household
help.

"We lend ourselves to it because we have such a diverse business base. You can
start a little operation without having to spend too much money," he said.
"We're so spread out that it's hard for the authorities to track you down."

He said there are about 799,000 "non-employer firms" -- or companies that have
no paid employees -- listed in Los Angeles County alone. In many cases, they are
independent contractors such as truck drivers at the ports or residential real
estate brokers. But at least 12,000 of them are manufacturing firms.

"How do they do it with no paid employees?" Kyser asked. "It's very hard to keep
tabs on everything."

Homes abandoned for years before sold at auction

BYLINE: Aly Van Dyke.

LENGTH: 1289 words


Driving down the streets of Chesney Park, you will find old homes with brick
facades; quaint, manicured lawns; and the character some find missing from new
construction. New Habitat for Humanity homes also bring a certain old-time charm
nestled in the 138-year-old neighborhood.

Every so often, however, you will pass by a home with broken windows. A yard
overgrown with thigh-high weeds. Doors gaping ajar, revealing more damage and
graffiti inside.

No matter how charming a neighborhood is, these abandoned, decrepit homes turn
people away. Tom Benaka, who has owned rental properties in Chesney Park for
more than 30 years, worries it will only get worse.

Delinquency rates are on the rise, Benaka said, and with Topeka's and Shawnee
County's mill levies next year increasing more than they have in the past
decade, the amount of back taxes - and the corresponding number of abandoned
properties - will go up.

"We're left with these properties sitting in our neighborhood for years, and the
taxes aren't being paid and they're running the rest of the property values
down," Benaka said. "If they didn't pay in 2012, and they're raising them, how
are they going to pay in 2013?"

Although Shawnee County has a means to collect these taxes - through threat and
eventual auction of delinquent properties - it is a lengthy process, leaving
homes abandoned for at least four years before they make it to a sale.

Tax sales

Shawnee County has been relatively successful in its tax sales over the years.

In the past two years, the county has filed four petitions against a total of
411 properties, ultimately netting almost $3.3 million.

Of those properties, 227 made good on their taxes before the auction, bringing
in almost $2.9 million in back taxes. Another 132 properties were sold at
auction for $144,000. The remaining properties were dismissed prior to the
auction.

The county's current case, which is set for auction Oct. 16, initially involved
151 properties. Since the August publication of the delinquencies, however, 69
tracts paid the owed taxes, resulting in the collection of $564,892.29 as of
Aug. 29.

That is about 6 percent of the total $8.4 million owed in 2012 from 5,780
properties, according to the delinquent list published in August in the Topeka
Metro News.

Adding in prior-year delinquencies, however, results in more than $10 million
owed in taxes, interest and penalties to taxing entities in Shawnee County from
more than 7,300 properties, according to a dataset provided by the county in
mid-June. Nearly 120 properties in the county owed more than $10,000 in back
taxes.

The top two tax bills on a single property belong to 4117 S.W. Huntoon and 6020
S.W. 29th Street, both owned by Lindemuth Inc. As of mid-June, the properties
owed a combined $492,216.08.

Getting to the sale, however, takes at least four years for residential
properties, said county counselor Rich Eckert.

A commercial property has to be delinquent for two years before the county can
file a petition to sell it, he said. Residential properties have to be
delinquent for three years.

Once that deadline is met, the county has to send the properties to a title
company in batches of 40 or 50, to make it manageable, Eckert said. That takes
about five months, then the district court has to issue and sheriff's deputies
have to serve summons to all the property owners and interested parties. That
can be six or seven people per property, he said.

When all is said and done, it takes at least another year before the property
goes to auction. The average time these properties have been delinquent is
between four and six years, he said.

"If it's more than that, we are well aware of it, and it's for a specific
reason," Eckert said.

Usually, those reasons include bankruptcies, ownership disputes or other
litigation.

Abandoned homes

In the interim, properties are stuck in limbo and left to deteriorate.

Since Frank Hoge, 87, moved to Chesney Park roughly 55 years ago, he has watched
it change from a close, family-oriented community to pockets of rentals dotted
with abandoned homes.

Just down the street, in view of his front lawn, sits 2058 S.W. Buchanan. The
front door is unlocked, opening to a barren home with swatches of blue paint
spread randomly on the walls. Several windows are broken, its back door rests
against the home, torn from its hinges, and the yard completely gone to weed.

It has been delinquent since 2010 and owes $1,153.13, according to county
records. It will be eligible for next year's tax sale.

A few turns away, at S.W. 20th and Clay, two homes crumble next to each other.
Windows and doors broken, lawn saturated with weeds, one house had a chain-link
fence stripped completely away.

"You can't sell a neighborhood if you've got a bunch of houses that look like
they'll explode any minute," Hoge said Friday as he directed the way to the next
decrepit house. "The county is doing, I suppose, what it can, but this system is
out of whack. It takes too long to get stuff done."

Benaka and Hoge are active in the Chesney Park Neighborhood Improvement
Association. As late as six months ago, the group made every effort to contact
the owners of these delinquent properties, Benaka said.

"What's left is beyond neighborhood people to fix it," he said. "It needs city
and county intervention. If we don't take care of some of the stuff in central
Topeka, it's going to fall down around our ears. The neighborhood people are
really trying, but it's more than they can do."

Delinquency rates

Eighty-five of Chesney Park's 551 homes were delinquent on their 2012 property
taxes as of Aug. 5, when Shawnee County first published its list of
delinquencies.

The 15 percent delinquency rate is about average for Topeka's 20 neighborhood
improvement associations, according to an analysis of delinquent taxes and
neighborhood health - though some neighborhoods eclipse that rate.

East Topeka South, for example, had a 30 percent delinquency rate. East Topeka
North was 24 percent delinquent.

Nearly a quarter of properties in neighborhoods designated as intensive care -
areas with the worst rates of crime, boarded houses and property values - were
delinquent on their 2012 taxes.

By contrast, only 5 percent of properties in healthy neighborhoods were
delinquent.

"I'm not shocked at all by this," said Topeka planning director Bill Fiander.
"These properties have a very low value to get into and very little risk to get
out and walk away."

Intensive care areas have been targeted by several city programs in recent
years, including its neighborhood planning program, which helps pay for housing
and infrastructure improvements, and tax rebates for people who fix up
properties in those areas.

Eighteen percent of properties falling with the tax rebate program were
delinquent, confirming the efforts are targeting the right areas, Fiander said.

The efforts appear to be working.

In 2007, for example, Chesney Park was labeled as intensive care. By 2011,
according to city figures, it was downgraded to at risk. In the past decade, the
number of seriously distressed neighborhoods has decreased from about 11 to
four.

But Benaka and Hoge want to see more neighborhood involvement. They are
encouraged by the new city management - Hoge said he has had more contact with
city manager Jim Colson than any other manager in the past. However, he said,
neighborhood organizations still don't receive the recognition from the city
that they should.

"The neighborhoods need to get into a position where they have a voice before
the public," Hoge said. "There needs to be exposure. Neighborhoods have to stay
on those issues and keep bringing them up in order to keep them in everybody's
eyes and minds."

Bank of America's Next Big Countrywide Problem

BYLINE: Kate Berry

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 16 Vol. 38 No. 48

LENGTH: 804  words


Two hundred sixty-three thousand.

Of all the numbers that have been batted around about the legacy of Bank of
America's ill-fated Countrywide acquisition after the bank's big Justice
Department recent settlement, that's the one to keep in mind going forward.

Brian Moynihan & Co. has attacked with gusto B of A's delinquent-loan portfolio
in recent years, much of which came from the 2008 acquisition of Countrywide.
But even after all that work - the chargeoffs, the loans sales, the
renegotiations - the bank still has 263,000 delinquent loans on its books.

B of A has estimated that it will get back to a normal level of delinquent loans
within two years, but that may be optimistic. Most of the loans it has left
probably cannot be sold, and working out problem loans - especially those at the
bottom of the barrel - is notoriously slow and labor intensive, analysts say.

"In later stages, the numbers are harder to move down," said Chris Mutascio, an
analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.

Such a daunting challenge is a fresh reminder of what everyone has known for
years: Bank of America's purchase of Countrywide Financial in 2008 was a bad
deal.

Estimates of exactly how bad have varied, but the Charlotte, N.C., bank has
pegged total losses from the ill-fated acquisition at more than $63 billion over
the past six years. That tally includes its purchase price, mortgage repurchase
claims, litigation and settlements, loan-loss provisions and chargeoffs on
residential loans and home equity lines of credit.

It's hard to find any silver lining - much harder than even JPMorgan Chase's
acquisition of Washington Mutual, which was a big reason for its $13 billion
settlement agreement with Justice last year but still gave the bank a big
presence on the West Coast.

B of A can't even take satisfaction in the retail network it gained. It acquired
1,000 field offices from Countrywide, but it has since had to shut down many of
them.

Countrywide "has been all cost and zero benefits" for B of A, said Isaac
Boltansky, a policy analyst at Compass Point Research & Trading.

B of A also received a $1.5 trillion servicing operation, including a portfolio
of nine million loans, but the cost to service the legacy loans has far exceeded
revenues because of the portfolio's high delinquency rates, analysts say.

Moynihan, B of A's chief executive since 2009, has sold off more than a trillion
dollars of nonperforming loans mostly to nonbank servicers in response.

But there is still a lot of work ahead.

B of A has reduced its residential servicing portfolio to $760 billion as of
June 30, down 23% from a year earlier. That's a far cry from the end of 2008,
when B of A oversaw more than $2 trillion in mortgages.

There have been some complications in the transfer of mortgage servicing rights
to other entities. Ginnie Mae has cracked down on servicers like B of A for
selling some delinquent loans without having all the necessary documents
including a proper title.

Problems with missing documents resurfaced this year in a program Ginnie created
before the mortgage crisis. The program allowed large servicers to quickly
transfer servicing rights if they agreed to send the essential records of the
mortgage, deed of trust, title policy and other documents within roughly a year.
If loans lack proper documentation, B of A may be stifled in trying to unload
any more nonperforming loans.

As a result, the work ahead largely involves whittling down the 263,000
delinquent loans remaining in its legacy book. They are valued at $38 billion.

The bank has established a reserve based on loan performance so it's unclear how
much in additional losses it would have to take on these loans.

The good news for B of A is that it has 81% fewer delinquent loans than the 1.4
million it held in the fourth quarter of 2010, at the height of the housing
crisis.

"They're been aggressive, but they had to be given the costs," Mutascio said.
"They sold some delinquent servicing, housing prices have gone up so losses have
been reduced, and the overall economy has improved."

Still, B of A is stuck with perhaps the largest number of delinquent loans of
any bank, analysts and servicing executives say.

Some of the delinquent borrowers can be refinanced or nursed back to health with
loan modifications. Many will end up in a short sale, deed-in-lieu or
foreclosure.

Moynihan said on a second-quarter conference call that reducing the number of
delinquent loans and legacy costs to a normal level of $500 million a quarter is
a major goal. Legacy servicing costs were $1.4 billion in the second quarter,
down from $2.3 billion a year earlier.

"They believe they can get quarterly costs on servicing down to a normal level
by late 2015 or perhaps early 2016," Mutascio said. "They've done a pretty good
job of late but they have a year or two more to get there."

mortgage, deed of trust, title policy and other documents within roughly a year.
If loans lack proper documentation, B of A may be stifled in trying to unload
any more nonperforming loans.

As a result, the work ahead largely involves whittling down the 263,000
delinquent loans remaining in its legacy book. They are valued at $38 billion.

The bank has established a reserve based on loan performance so it's unclear how
much in additional losses it would have to take on these loans.

The good news for B of A is that it has 81% fewer delinquent loans than the 1.4
million it held in the fourth quarter of 2010, at the height of the housing
crisis.

"They're been aggressive, but they had to be given the costs," Mutascio said.
"They sold some delinquent servicing, housing prices have gone up so losses have
been reduced, and the overall economy has improved."

Still, B of A is stuck with perhaps the largest number of delinquent loans of
any bank, analysts and servicing executives say.

Some of the delinquent borrowers can be refinanced or nursed back to health with
loan modifications. Many will end up in a short sale, deed-in-lieu or
foreclosure.

Moynihan said on a second-quarter conference call that reducing the number of
delinquent loans and legacy costs to a normal level of $500 million a quarter is
a major goal. Legacy servicing costs were $1.4 billion in the second quarter,
down from $2.3 billion a year earlier.

"They believe they can get quarterly costs on servicing down to a normal level
by late 2015 or perhaps early 2016," Mutascio said. "They've done a pretty good
job of late but they have a year or two more to get there."

Bank of America's Next Big Countrywide Problem

BYLINE: Kate Berry

Two hundred sixty-three thousand.

Of all the numbers that have been batted around about the legacy of Bank of
America's ill-fated Countrywide acquisition after the bank's big Justice
Department recent settlement, that's the one to keep in mind going forward.

Brian Moynihan & Co. has attacked with gusto B of A's delinquent-loan portfolio
in recent years, much of which came from the 2008 acquisition of Countrywide.
But even after all that work - the chargeoffs, the loans sales, the
renegotiations - the bank still has 263,000 delinquent loans on its books.

B of A has estimated that it will get back to a normal level of delinquent loans
within two years, but that may be optimistic. Most of the loans it has left
probably cannot be sold, and working out problem loans - especially those at the
bottom of the barrel - is notoriously slow and labor intensive, analysts say.

"In later stages, the numbers are harder to move down," said Chris Mutascio, an
analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.

Such a daunting challenge is a fresh reminder of what everyone has known for
years: Bank of America's purchase of Countrywide Financial in 2008 was a bad
deal.

Estimates of exactly how bad have varied, but the Charlotte, N.C., bank has
pegged total losses from the ill-fated acquisition at more than $63 billion over
the past six years. That tally includes its purchase price, mortgage repurchase
claims, litigation and settlements, loan-loss provisions and chargeoffs on
residential loans and home equity lines of credit.

It's hard to find any silver lining - much harder than even JPMorgan Chase's
acquisition of Washington Mutual, which was a big reason for its $13 billion
settlement agreement with Justice last year but still gave the bank a big
presence on the West Coast.

B of A can't even take satisfaction in the retail network it gained. It acquired
1,000 field offices from Countrywide, but it has since had to shut down many of
them.

Countrywide "has been all cost and zero benefits" for B of A, said Isaac
Boltansky, a policy analyst at Compass Point Research & Trading.

B of A also received a $1.5 trillion servicing operation, including a portfolio
of nine million loans, but the cost to service the legacy loans has far exceeded
revenues because of the portfolio's high delinquency rates, analysts say.

Moynihan, B of A's chief executive since 2009, has sold off more than a trillion
dollars of nonperforming loans mostly to nonbank servicers in response.

But there is still a lot of work ahead.

B of A has reduced its residential servicing portfolio to $760 billion as of
June 30, down 23% from a year earlier. That's a far cry from the end of 2008,
when B of A oversaw more than $2 trillion in mortgages.

There have been some complications in the transfer of mortgage servicing rights
to other entities. Ginnie Mae has cracked down on servicers like B of A for
selling some delinquent loans without having all the necessary documents
including a proper title.

Problems with missing documents resurfaced this year in a program Ginnie created
before the mortgage crisis. The program allowed large servicers to quickly
transfer servicing rights if they agreed to send the essential records of the
mortgage, deed of trust, title policy and other documents within roughly a year.
If loans lack proper documentation, B of A may be stifled in trying to unload

Bank of America's Next Big Countrywide Problem

BYLINE: Kate Berry

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 16 Vol. 38 No. 48

LENGTH: 804  words


Two hundred sixty-three thousand.

Of all the numbers that have been batted around about the legacy of Bank of
America's ill-fated Countrywide acquisition after the bank's big Justice
Department recent settlement, that's the one to keep in mind going forward.

Brian Moynihan & Co. has attacked with gusto B of A's delinquent-loan portfolio
in recent years, much of which came from the 2008 acquisition of Countrywide.
But even after all that work - the chargeoffs, the loans sales, the
renegotiations - the bank still has 263,000 delinquent loans on its books.

B of A has estimated that it will get back to a normal level of delinquent loans
within two years, but that may be optimistic. Most of the loans it has left
probably cannot be sold, and working out problem loans - especially those at the
bottom of the barrel - is notoriously slow and labor intensive, analysts say.

"In later stages, the numbers are harder to move down," said Chris Mutascio, an
analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.

Such a daunting challenge is a fresh reminder of what everyone has known for
years: Bank of America's purchase of Countrywide Financial in 2008 was a bad
deal.

Estimates of exactly how bad have varied, but the Charlotte, N.C., bank has
pegged total losses from the ill-fated acquisition at more than $63 billion over
the past six years. That tally includes its purchase price, mortgage repurchase
claims, litigation and settlements, loan-loss provisions and chargeoffs on
residential loans and home equity lines of credit.

It's hard to find any silver lining - much harder than even JPMorgan Chase's
acquisition of Washington Mutual, which was a big reason for its $13 billion
settlement agreement with Justice last year but still gave the bank a big
presence on the West Coast.

B of A can't even take satisfaction in the retail network it gained. It acquired
1,000 field offices from Countrywide, but it has since had to shut down many of
them.

Countrywide "has been all cost and zero benefits" for B of A, said Isaac
Boltansky, a policy analyst at Compass Point Research & Trading.

B of A also received a $1.5 trillion servicing operation, including a portfolio
of nine million loans, but the cost to service the legacy loans has far exceeded
revenues because of the portfolio's high delinquency rates, analysts say.

Moynihan, B of A's chief executive since 2009, has sold off more than a trillion
dollars of nonperforming loans mostly to nonbank servicers in response.

But there is still a lot of work ahead.

B of A has reduced its residential servicing portfolio to $760 billion as of
June 30, down 23% from a year earlier. That's a far cry from the end of 2008,
when B of A oversaw more than $2 trillion in mortgages.

There have been some complications in the transfer of mortgage servicing rights
to other entities. Ginnie Mae has cracked down on servicers like B of A for
selling some delinquent loans without having all the necessary documents
including a proper title.

Problems with missing documents resurfaced this year in a program Ginnie created
before the mortgage crisis. The program allowed large servicers to quickly
transfer servicing rights if they agreed to send the essential records of the
mortgage, deed of trust, title policy and other documents within roughly a year.
If loans lack proper documentation, B of A may be stifled in trying to unload
any more nonperforming loans.

As a result, the work ahead largely involves whittling down the 263,000
delinquent loans remaining in its legacy book. They are valued at $38 billion.

The bank has established a reserve based on loan performance so it's unclear how
much in additional losses it would have to take on these loans.

The good news for B of A is that it has 81% fewer delinquent loans than the 1.4
million it held in the fourth quarter of 2010, at the height of the housing
crisis.

"They're been aggressive, but they had to be given the costs," Mutascio said.
"They sold some delinquent servicing, housing prices have gone up so losses have
been reduced, and the overall economy has improved."

Still, B of A is stuck with perhaps the largest number of delinquent loans of
any bank, analysts and servicing executives say.

Some of the delinquent borrowers can be refinanced or nursed back to health with
loan modifications. Many will end up in a short sale, deed-in-lieu or
foreclosure.

Moynihan said on a second-quarter conference call that reducing the number of
delinquent loans and legacy costs to a normal level of $500 million a quarter is
a major goal. Legacy servicing costs were $1.4 billion in the second quarter,
down from $2.3 billion a year earlier.

"They believe they can get quarterly costs on servicing down to a normal level
by late 2015 or perhaps early 2016," Mutascio said. "They've done a pretty good
job of late but they have a year or two more to get there."

Bank of America's Next Big Countrywide Problem

Bank of America Delinquent Loans Mean RMBS Losses

BYLINE: Bloomberg News

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 23 Vol. 37 No. 14

LENGTH: 1144  words


Bank of America Corp. has amassed $64 billion of mortgages that are at least six
months delinquent and have yet to enter foreclosure, more than twice the amount
held by its four largest competitors combined.

The loans are monitored as part of February's $25 billion settlement between the
top five U.S. lenders and state attorneys general over allegations of abusive
foreclosure practices. B of A's stockpile of deteriorating debt is mostly from
its 2008 acquisition of Countrywide, once the nation's largest mortgage
provider. Wells Fargo, the biggest U.S. servicer, has $15.3 billion of such
unpaid loans.

The data, published last month by the monitor of the settlement, highlight B of
A's vast backlog of delinquencies, and the years it will take to work through
them as borrowers fall further behind and losses mount for MBS investors. While
the Charlotte, N.C. -based bank has begun modifications for many of its 275,000
homeowners at least 180 days behind as of Sept. 30, some will join the already
clogged U.S. foreclosure pipeline.

"There's just a long tail to work out all of these loans, which are severely
delinquent at this point," said Marty Mosby, a Guggenheim Securities analyst in
Memphis. "It just shows the amount of work that's still left to do."

Delays loan processing add to expenses borne by investors because maintenance,
property taxes and other costs add up. While rising prices may make the MBS more
valuable, servicers can be forced to come up with cash to cover interest
payments from the delinquent loans and modifications become more difficult to
accomplish as the borrower's unpaid debt grows.

B of A's portfolio of loans that are at least six months old and not in
foreclosure accounts for 3.3% of all of the mortgages it services. Citigroup
Inc. has 1.1% of its loans in that category and Ally Financial, Wells Fargo and
JPMorgan Chase each have less than 1%. B of A has about 930,000 loans that are
at least 60 days delinquent, down from 1.5 million from the peak in January
2010, CEO Brian Moynihan said during a Dec. 14 event at the Brookings
Institution in Washington.

The company's large share in part reflects an agreement made in conjunction with
the mortgage settlement to delay home seizures while attempting to modify loans,
as well as with other temporary moratoriums the bank implemented since 2008,
said Eric Telljohann, an SVP in the servicing division, which employs about
50,000 people.

B of A postponed foreclosure sales for more than 200,000 delinquent borrowers
who may be eligible for principal reductions, and a portion of those loans were
not yet in foreclosure, according to Telljohann. Most of the homeowners have
been contacted, and about 40,000 of them are in trial mod plans, he said. The
bank also has a large portion of delinquent FHA loans, which require servicers
to follow a more time-consuming process to assess borrowers for loan workouts,
Telljohann said. "We are definitely in a very thoughtful and deliberate manner
trying to work the number delinquent loans down," he said.

Mortgages at the time the borrower lost the property averaged a record 728 days
late in October, up from 661 days a year earlier, according to Lender Processing
Services. The U.S. average was 367 days in December 2008, before President Obama
took office and started programs to help struggling homeowners keep their
residences.

While processing delays have given borrowers time to negotiate loan workouts,
large lenders often lose documents and ask borrowers to resubmit them
repeatedly, said Alan White, a professor who teaches consumer law at the City
University of New York. "With delinquent mortgages you want to triage them, work
out ones that can be worked out and foreclose the ones that can't," he said.
"But if the only outcome is no outcome, it's not helping any of the parties
affected."

B of A, which has been criticized by housing advocates for delaying loan
workouts, has already spent more than $40 billion to clean up the loans
inherited from Countrywide and faces a federal lawsuit seeking $1 billion over a
program to allegedly sell defective mortgages, called the Hustle. The firm is
relying in part on falling costs from servicing bad loans to help improve
profitability. Moynihan said Nov. 13 that expenses for the unit handling bad
loans were peaking and should start to decline next year.

About 85% of B of A's loans that are more than 60 days delinquent are
Countrywide loans, according to Dan Frahm, a spokesman. "No mortgage servicer
has ever had to address the scale of delinquent loans that Bank of America has
as a result of the Countrywide acquisition," Frahm said. "We've met that
challenge by modifying more loans than any other servicer. We've participated in
every available program to meet the needs of our customers and developed our own
programs beyond that."

B of A, "by choice or otherwise," appears to be moving loans to foreclosure more
slowly than other banks, Mark Kaufman, commissioner of the Maryland Office of
Financial Regulation, wrote in a column published Nov. 20 in American Banker,
opposing a proposal to increase mortgage fees in states with long foreclosure
timelines. Maryland homeowners who received notices of intent to foreclose from
B of A were on average more than 500 days delinquent, Kaufman wrote. By
contrast, notices filed by the three next-largest servicers averaged 180 days
late. The letters can be sent as soon as 45 days after delinquency, he said.
"This data suggests that a major statistical driver of time is not the law, but
who services your mortgage," he wrote.

The top five lenders slowed the pace of foreclosures starting in October 2010 as
they negotiated with attorneys general over allegations of faulty and fraudulent
paperwork used to repossess homes. The settlement directs $17 billion to writing
down debt and restricts banks from foreclosing on borrowers while they're
negotiating modifications.

The data on delinquent loans not in foreclosure "seems to confirm anecdotal
reports that B of A has been much slower than other servicers in dealing with
problem loans," said Thomas Lawler, a former Fannie Mae economist, now a housing
consultant in Leesburg, Va. B of A customers waited as long as two years to be
told whether they qualified for HAMP, according to testimony from Ryan Quinn, a
former employee. Quinn, a customer-service rep on B of A's modification team
from April 2010 to March 2011, testified after being subpoenaed last year by the
Nevada AG as part of a suit against the bank.

Employees were given minimal training, didn't have computer passwords to find
documents, and were discouraged from spending more than seven minutes speaking
to borrowers, he said. Eighty percent of the calls Quinn took were about delays,
he said. The bank "wanted to make it take as long as possible," Quinn told
investigators. Frahm declined to comment.

Justice Department Announces Bulletin on Substance Use and Delinquent Behavior
Among Serious Offenders

LENGTH: 218  words

DATELINE: Karachi


Karachi, Dec. 28 -- The Department of Justice's Office of Justice Programs today
announced the release of Substance Use and Delinquent Behavior Among Serious
Offenders, a bulletin based on findings from a longitudinal study, Pathways to
Desistance: A Prospective Study of Delinquent Offenders, which was sponsored by
the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. Over a seven year
period, the Pathways to Desistance research team followed a group of 1,354 young
offenders in Philadelphia, PA, and Maricopa County, AZ, after their conviction,
collecting comprehensive data on their offending and their lives.

The authors present key findings on the link between adolescent substance use
and serious offending, including that substance use and offending at one age is
a consistent predictor of continued serious offending at a later age; substance
use and serious offending fluctuate in similar patterns over time; and both
decrease in late adolescence. This study provides the most comprehensive data
available about serious juvenile offenders and their lives in late adolescence
and early adulthood. Published by HT Syndication with permission from Daily Pak

County demands delinquent taxes from Hilton hotel

BYLINE: Ron DaParma

LENGTH: 281 words


Delinquent county taxes could take some of the luster off a $27 million
renovation of the Pittsburgh Hilton Hotel.

Allegheny County Treasurer John Weinstein says he may soon take court action
against Shubh Hotels, the Boca-Raton, Fla.-based owner of the city's largest
hotel, unless the company does something about paying about $31,220 due from
September, including penalties and interest.

An undetermined amount of additional taxes for at least four months of
unreported revenues also is overdue, Weinstein said. The tax involved is the 7
percent tax the county collects on hotel room-charge proceeds.

"The county has been extremely patient based on the circumstances surrounding
this hotel and has given the Hilton more than ample opportunity to operate in
good faith and resolve the debt," said Weinstein.

The warning comes after an extensive interior makeover, including upgrades of
all guestrooms, that is now complete and construction on an exterior addition
resumed in December after a seven-month hiatus.

Exterior work came to a stop in May, when P.J. Dick, the prime contractor, and
other companies left the construction site, with some filing liens and lawsuits
seeking payments for delinquent bills. P.J. Dick returned in mid-December. The
17,000-square-foot addition is now expected to be completed in June.

Shubh acknowledged problems in raising financing, but in September said it
secured additional working capital.

"I believe there is a working arrangement in place with the county to pay our
bills, but I'm not privy to the details," said Mark De Intinis, acting general
manager at the hotel. "I think the county has been gracious in allowing us to
try and work this out."

Water-Sewer Authority Weighs Delinquent Bills, Rate Increase

D'Vera Cohn, Washington Post Staff Writer

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B01

LENGTH: 810 words


The District is owed $ 30 million in delinquent water and sewer fees, mostly
from apartment building owners, at a time when a new regional authority is
considering a hefty rate increase for residential and commercial customers.

The delinquency problem dates back many years, but members of the authority said
yesterday at their first meeting that they must start to solve it. The board has
called for an aggressive collection program to begin within a month -- possibly
cutting off water to buildings with deadbeat landlords.

The 11-member D.C. Water and Sewer Authority, which includes representatives
from the District, Maryland and Virginia, will take control of the District's
regional Blue Plains sewage plant and the city's water distribution system
Tuesday. The authority, created after an audit found that the District had used
$ 83 million in water and sewer revenue for other projects, will control that
revenue. The water and sewer systems are under federal consent orders to make
costly improvements.

Yesterday, the authority released a list of "critical resource requirements" --
problems caused by lack of money and staffing. Among them: Thirty-eight percent
of the authority's 725 vehicles either do not work or are being repaired.

The authority also said that because 500 water and sewer jobs are vacant:

Repair and cleaning work is often delayed.

Sewage plant operators are required to work "substantial overtime," and if a
water pipe breaks at night, the day shift is recalled to fix it because there is
not enough staff for a full overnight crew.

Some employees work 12- to 18-hour shifts responding to emergencies that could
have been avoided by a preventive maintenance program -- but there is not enough
staff to run one.

The improvements needed to operate a first-class system will require a large
rate increase, officials say, and the board's calendar calls for approval within
a month of an increase in customer fees.

Members said the job of whittling the delinquency is important not just to
collect the money but also to help overcome objections to a rate increase.

People who are paying their bills need to know that if their fees rise, "we're
not going to subsidize those people who are not paying," said D.C. City
Administrator Michael C. Rogers, the authority's chairman.

"I don't want to see us wait one more day," said District representative Charles
C. Johnson, a former U.S. assistant surgeon general. Former Montgomery county
executive Sidney Kramer added, "This should be a priority."

District representative Ron M. Linton agreed that action is needed, but he is
concerned that a water cutoff would punish tenants who "are not the guilty
parties."

Castina Kennedy, chief of the city's water and sewer billing division, said
about $ 12 million of the delinquent amount probably never can be collected.
About $ 4.1 million is from buildings whose owners filed for bankruptcy, she
said in an interview.

Most of the debt -- $ 24.6 million -- is owed by owners of about 2,000 apartment
buildings with four units or more, she said.

"We've done everything we possibly can do" -- including liens and advertising
buildings for tax sale -- Kennedy told the authority. But "the only thing that
works is receivership," a slow process in which the city takes control of tenant
rent payments and deducts the overdue bills, she said.

As of this month, eight buildings were in receivership, with debt totaling about
$ 228,000, she said.

One obstacle, she said, is that "all the landlords know" the city will not cut
off water and sewer service to apartment buildings.

Landlords have accounted for three-quarters or more of delinquent water and
sewer bills for at least a decade, but the city's total delinquent bill barely
has budged in that time.

At least twice, the city has announced plans to cut off water and sewer service
to buildings whose landlords are late in paying their bills, but has dropped the
idea because of protests it would hurt innocent tenants.

Then-Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly (D) threatened water cutoff in 1993, coupled with
an amnesty program, but that was blocked by the D.C. Council. Figures released
at the time said 612 buildings were responsible for $ 27 million of the $ 34
million debt.

In 1987, Mayor Marion Barry (D) halted a planned campaign by the Department of
Public Works to collect $ 18 million in delinquent bills from landlords.

The last water and sewer rate increase took effect in 1988. At the time, rates
had been raised 87 percent in five years to cover a deficit.

A consulting firm study last year estimated that water and sewer rates for D.C.
customers would have to rise 77 percent to pay for needed capital improvements
and hiring. Water and sewer authority officials say that estimate is out of
date, and they are compiling a new one.

Maryland Town Writes Off $120K, Largely From Defunct Businesses

SECTION: CCR - OTHER CONSUMER Vol. 1 No. 1

LENGTH: 219  words


The city of Frederick, Md. lost more than $120,000 in revenue between fiscal
years 2010 and 2012 because of uncollected fees from previous years - most a
result of defunct businesses.Most of the delinquent accounts are from
uncollected property tax revenue, taxes based on the property a business owns,
such as desks and chairs. The unresolved accounts are often from businesses that
no longer exist, having dissolved or forfeited their operating license,
according to city officials.The city annually writes off accounts with
uncollected revenue at least three fiscal years old, after attempts to collect
through collection notices and potential litigation.This year's list includes an
estimated $30,942 from delinquent personal property tax accounts in fiscal 2008,
as well as $6,893 in uncollected fees stemming from a former employee's
delinquent COBRA health insurance account and the replacement of a damaged light
pole. In fiscal 2011, the city stopped pursuing debtors who owed
$60,824.48.Patti Slimmer, the city's accounting manager, said the city's lawyers
and staff, rather than an outside collection agency, attempt to collect the
funds. And while the accounts are removed from the city's financial ledgers, it
is still be possible to collect delinquent fees if an owner were to come
forward. Slimmer says.

Lackawanna judicial sale set for Feb. 23

Jan. 14--A record 309 properties with delinquent taxes of $6.5 million are
headed to auction next month as Lackawanna County readies its 2011 judicial
sale.

The county Tax Claim Bureau on Thursday finalized the list of properties that
will be offered at the Wednesday, Feb. 23, sale with the objective of finding
new owners who will pay the taxes on a regular basis, deputy director Ron
Koldjeski said.

Some have delinquencies dating back to 1993, he said.

"The last thing we want to do is take somebody's house or land, but if they
don't care, we have to get them into the hands of someone who will pay," Mr.
Koldjeski said.

He said the 309 properties fall into three categories: those that did not
attract a buyer during last fall's upset sale, those with tax delinquencies of
$25,000 or more and multiple delinquent properties with a single owner.

The judicial sale will be the fourth conducted by the administration of majority
Commissioners Corey O'Brien and Mike Washo, who took office in 2008 and revived
the sales after a hiatus of at least a decade.

Mr. Koldjeski anticipates the number of properties listed for sale will dwindle
significantly by Feb. 23, falling to between 175 and 200, as owners pay off all
or parts of their delinquent taxes.

To avoid the judicial sale, the delinquency must be paid by Tuesday, Feb. 22, at
noon, he said.

In 2010, the owners of about 35 percent of the 215 properties scheduled for
judicial sale came in beforehand and settled, bringing in more than $445,000 in
delinquent taxes, he said.

"A lot of people will call up and say they didn't know the taxes hadn't been
paid in 10 years," Mr. Koldjeski said.

An owner who believes a property is on the list in error can file a written
objection with the clerk of judicial records.

County court will begin hearing the objections on Friday, Feb. 10.

"After Feb. 10, for anybody who is still in, the only way to get out is to pay
what is owed," Mr. Koldjeski said.

Unlike an upset sale, in which the sale price includes all of the unpaid taxes
and the buyer is responsible for other outstanding encumbrances, properties at a
judicial sale are sold free and clear of past liens, judgments and mortgages.

Foreclosure Filings Increase By 21%

BYLINE: Jennifer Harmon

SECTION: SERVICING; Pg. 17 Vol. 34 No. 20

LENGTH: 529  words


A massive supply of delinquent loans continues to loom over the housing market,
and many of those delinquencies will end up in the foreclosure process in 2010
and beyond as lenders gradually work their way through the backlog.

Recent data from RealtyTrac showed over 3.9 million foreclosure filings,
including default notices, scheduled foreclosure auctions and bank repossession
were reported on 2.8 million properties in 2009, up 21% from 2008 and 120% from
2007.

"As bad as the 2009 numbers are, they probably would have been worse if not for
legislative and industry-related delays in processing delinquent loans," said
James Saccacio, chief executive officer of RealtyTrac, Irvine, Calif.

"After peaking in July with over 361,000 homes receiving a foreclosure notice,
we saw four straight monthly decreases driven primarily by short-term factors:
trial loan modifications, state legislation extending the foreclosure process
and an overwhelming volume of inventory clogging the foreclosure pipeline."

Despite all the delays, foreclosure activity still hit a record high for the
company's yearend 2009 Foreclosure Market Report, capped off by a substantial
increase in December, Mr. Saccacio said.

"In the long term a massive supply of delinquent loans continues to loom over
the housing market, and many of those delinquencies will end up in the
foreclosure process in 2010 and beyond as lenders gradually work their way
through the backlog," he added.

More than 10% of Nevada housing units received at least one foreclosure filing
in 2009, giving it the nation's highest state foreclosure rate for the third
consecutive year. Nevada activity in December increased 27% from November but
was still down 22% from December 2008.

Fourth-quarter foreclosure activity in Nevada was down 37% from the previous
quarter thanks to substantial decreases in October and November.

Arizona registered the nation's second highest state foreclosure rate in 2009,
with more than 6% of its housing units receiving at least one filing during the
year, and Florida registered the nation's third highest rate, with 5.93% of its
housing units receiving at least one filing in 2009.

Other states with foreclosure rates ranking among the nation's 10 highest were
California (4.75%), Utah (2.93%), Idaho (2.72%), Georgia (2.68%), Michigan
(2.61%), Illinois (2.5%) and Colorado (2.37%).

California, Florida, Arizona and Illinois accounted for more than 50% of the
nation's 2009 total, with more than 1.4 million properties receiving a
foreclosure filing.

In California, 632,573 properties received a filing in 2009, up 21% from 2008.
Florida reported 516,711 properties with filings, a 34% increase over 2008.

Activity in Arizona included 163,210 properties with a filing in 2009, up 40%
from a year earlier.

A total of 131,132 Illinois properties received a filing, an increase of 32%
from 2008.

Other states with 2009 totals among the 10 highest in the country were Michigan
(118,302), Nevada (112,097), Georgia (106,110), Ohio (101,614), Texas (100,045)
and New Jersey (63,208).

Cities in four Sun Belt States accounted for all top 20 foreclosure rates in
2009, but activity spread into prior insulated areas.

State cracks down on tax delinquents Schwarzenegger proposes hiring additional
agents to investigate dodgers

BYLINE: By Harrison Sheppard, MEDIANEWS STAFF

SECTION: ARGUS

LENGTH: 797 words


SACRAMENTO -- As yet another tax season approaches, California officials are
cracking down on cheats and delinquent payers -- estimated at more than 750,000
across the state -- who owe billions of dollars from 2006 alone.

With the state facing a massive budget crisis, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger is
proposing more funding to hire 500 new tax collections and investigations
personnel that could generate at least $126 million in net revenue for state
coffers.

State tax agents have begun posting the names of the biggest delinquents online
in an effort to capture more revenue.

"We're working really hard on the underground economy and trying to find people
who are evading taxes or getting paid under the table and not filing taxes on
that income," said Franchise Tax Board spokeswoman Holly McDonell.

McDonell estimated a $6.5 billion "tax gap" in California -- the difference
between state income taxes owed and paid.

The state estimates the number of nonfilers by reviewing people who filed
federal returns with a California address but did not file state returns.
Officials also cross-check other financial information such as mortgage payments
and vehicle registrations as well as gather information through a toll-free tip
line.

Tax enforcement may be one of the few areas that will receive a funding boost
next year as the state faces a $14.5 billion budget deficit.

Schwarzenegger has proposed 10 percent across-the-board cuts for most state
agencies and programs, but he also proposed funding increases for more than a
dozen programs related to tax collection and fraud investigation.

"With the current budget crisis, these are important measures to increase
revenues to the general fund, at a time when we need it the most,"
administration spokesman Bill Maile said. "The benefits clearly outweigh the
costs. We need to target non-compliance, and the underground economy, and be as
effective as possible in collecting taxes owed to the state."

One proposal calls for 106 new state workers to identify businesses that operate
without a permit and therefore evade payment of sales and use tax. Officials
estimate that new enforcement could generate $37.9 million in revenue.

Other proposals include an additional 15 investigators to look into people who
register vehicles worth at least $40,000 but do not file a personal-income tax
return; 27 positions to cross-check IRS records for people who file federal
returns but not state returns; and 32 positions to investigate fraudulent claims
for dependents and child care credits and other refunds.

Another 15 positions would investigate leads generated from border inspection
stations on businesses that may be importing goods without paying the
appropriate taxes.

State Controller John Chiang, chairman of the Franchise Tax Board, said that
during previous lean budget years the state had to cut its tax enforcement staff
-- which may have been counterproductive to the state's financial interest.

Still, he said, the state has approved new programs such as increased use of
electronic filing and additional seminars for businesses and non-English
speakers.

The tax board also recently launched a new program to go after big tax shelters
that may have helped wealthy taxpayers illegally avoid paying tens of millions
of dollars in taxes.

Chiang acknowledged that going after every transaction in the underground
economy would be expensive and nearly impossible. But state agents don't have to
investigate every business for the word to get out.

"We would audit some of the businesses. That information gets shared," Chiang
said. "We hope to bring in significant dollars."

Some economists say it is likely the state will never develop effective
mechanisms to collect taxes from the underground economy because it is so big.

Jack Kyser, chief economist of the Los Angeles County Economic Development
Corp., said Los Angeles in particular -- with its diverse population and
spread-out territory -- hosts a large underground economy that includes taco
trucks on Olympic Boulevard, day laborers in front of Home Depot and household
help.

"We lend ourselves to it because we have such a diverse business base. You can
start a little operation without having to spend too much money," he said.
"We're so spread out that it's hard for the authorities to track you down."

He said there are about 799,000 "non-employer firms" -- or companies that have
no paid employees -- listed in Los Angeles County alone. In many cases, they are
independent contractors such as truck drivers at the ports or residential real
estate brokers. But at least 12,000 of them are manufacturing firms.

"How do they do it with no paid employees?" Kyser asked. "It's very hard to keep
tabs on everything."

Just one more week - then tax amnesty ends Saturday deadline: Delinquent
taxpayers can escape criminal prosecution and fines by the state - if they pay
up fast.

The "avalanche" hasn't started but the Department of Revenue expects delinquent
taxpayers to do just what everybody else does - wait and file at the last
minute.

But for Georgians seeking to pay their back taxes without a penalty, the last
minute will arrive Saturday.

Under the 60-day amnesty program, state officials will waive criminal
prosecution and fines for delinquent taxpayers who come forward to pay their tax
bills by Dec. 5.

After the deadline, Georgia residents caught evading tax payments will face
penalties of up to $ 5,000, three years in jail and collection fees of up to 50
percent of the taxes owed.

Joe Tillman, the program coordinator, said more than $ 7.9 million has been
collected so far from some 16,000 people, substantially short of the $ 30
million expected before the program ends.

Mr. Tillman said he expects "the avalanche will hit me" this week.

To make it easier for taxpayers to pay up, the Department of Revenue is
extending office hours. The department's 11 regional offices will be open from 8
a.m. to 7 p.m. each day this week and from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Saturday. The
central office at 270 Washington St. in Atlanta also will be open.

As part of the planned crackdown after amnesty, the department has hired 75
auditors and will begin using private collection services to help locate tax
cheats. In January, the department will begin using a new computer system to
share tax information with other states.

Here are some telephone numbers for the Georgia Revenue Department:

Lithia Springs regional office (404) 732-5812.

Morrow regional office (404) 960-2000.

Tucker regional office (404) 493-5600.

Metro Atlanta (404) 656-4674.

sell all real property for which an

59      acceptable bid is made; and
             60          (ii) refuse to offer a parcel of real property for sale
if the description of the real
             61      property is so defective as to convey no title.
             62          (b) The auditor may post at the place of sale a copy of
the published list of real
             63      property to be offered and cry the sale by reference to the

             64      separately.
             65          (2) (a) The tax commission shall establish, by rule,

             69      the delinquent property that best protect the financial
interest of the delinquent property owner

delinquent property taxes due.
             71          (3) The county governing body may authorize the auditor
to combine for sale two or
             72      more contiguous parcels owned by the same party when:
             73          (a) the parcels are a single economic or functional

interests of the delinquent property
             75      owner; and
             76          (c) separate sales will reduce the economic value of
the unit.
             77          (4) The governing body may accept any of the following
bids:
             78          (a) the highest bid amount for the entire parcel of
property, however, a bid may not be
             79      accepted for an amount which is insufficient to pay the
taxes, penalties, interest, and
             80      administrative costs; or
             81          (b) a bid in an amount sufficient to pay the taxes,
penalties, interest, and administrative
             82      costs, for less than the entire parcel.
             83          (i) The bid which shall be accepted shall be the bid of
the bidder who will pay in cash
             84      the full amount of the taxes, penalties, interest, and
administrative costs for the smallest portion
             85      of the entire parcel.
             86          (ii) The county auditor at the tax sale or the county
legislative body following the tax
             87      sale shall reject a bid to purchase a strip of property
around the entire perimeter of the parcel,
             88      or a bid to purchase a strip of the parcel which would
prevent access to the remainder of the
             89      parcel by the redemptive owner or otherwise unreasonably
diminish the value of that

90      remainder.
             91          (iii) If the bid accepted is for less than the entire
parcel, the auditor shall note the fact,
             92      with a description of the property covered by the bid, upon
the tax sale record and the balance

             58          (i) attend at the place appointed, offer for sale, and
sell all real property for which an

59      acceptable bid is made; and
             60          (ii) refuse to offer a parcel of real property for sale
if the description of the real
             61      property is so defective as to convey no title.
             62          (b) The auditor may post at the place of sale a copy of
the published list of real
             63      property to be offered and cry the sale by reference to the

             65          (2) (a) The tax commission shall establish, by rule,

procedures, by ordinance, for the sale of
             69      the delinquent property that best protect the financial
interest of the delinquent property owner

delinquent property taxes due.
             71          (3) The county governing body may authorize the auditor
to combine for sale two or
             72      more contiguous parcels owned by the same party when:

interests of the delinquent property
             75      owner; and
             76          (c) separate sales will reduce the economic value of
the unit.

bids:
             78          (a) the highest bid amount for the entire parcel of

             82      costs, for less than the entire parcel.
             83          (i) The bid which shall be accepted shall be the bid of
the bidder who will pay in cash
             84      the full amount of the taxes, penalties, interest, and
administrative costs for the smallest portion
             85      of the entire parcel.
             86          (ii) The county auditor at the tax sale or the county
legislative body following the tax
             87      sale shall reject a bid to purchase a strip of property
around the entire perimeter of the parcel,
             88      or a bid to purchase a strip of the parcel which would
prevent access to the remainder of the
             89      parcel by the redemptive owner or otherwise unreasonably
diminish the value of that

90      remainder.
             91          (iii) If the bid accepted is for less than the entire
parcel, the auditor shall note the fact,

KEEP PRESSURE ON TAX SCOFFLAWS;
THOSE OF US WHO DO PAY WHAT WE OWE IN WISCONSIN TAXES GET STUCK PICKING UP THE
TAB FOR THE DEADBEATS WHO DON'T.

SECTION: OPINION; Pg. A8

LENGTH: 379 words


Wisconsin is successfully shaming hundreds of delinquent taxpayers into paying
what they owe.

But there's still a long ways to go.

Wisconsin launched a Web site in early January listing the names of thousands of
people and businesses that owed more than $25,000 in back taxes to the state.

Everyone listed on the site has exhausted their appeals and has still not paid
in at least three months. Each scofflaw also has failed to pay by installment
and has not filed for bankruptcy.

The state Web site is doing better than expected by embarrassing more deadbeats
into finally paying what they owe. The state Department of Revenue credits the
high-profile list of delinquents with the collection of about $16 million so
far.

That amount alone won't fix the state's budget problems. But every little bit
helps.

The collection of back taxes also helps ensures that responsible taxpayers are
treated fairly. After all, those of us who do pay what we owe get stuck picking
up the tab for those who don't.

Some individuals and companies alone still owe as much as $1.9 million to state
coffers, according to the Department of Revenue. That means the shame game must
continue.

If everyone paid up, Wisconsin would be about $485 million richer.

To view the top 100 delinquent taxpayers go to
www.revenue.wi.gov/html/delqlist.html. The state's database of deadbeats also
can be sorted by name and by the city.

The worst freeloader listed on the site Tuesday was Prime Security Services with
a tab of $1.94 million. The last known address for the company was a post office
box in Oakland, Calif.

Seven of the top 10 people or companies listed on the Web site have out-of-state
addresses.

The worst offender whose last known address was in Wisconsin is Mobile & Modular
Inc. The company has or had a post office box in Trevor and owes $1.8 million.

The worst case in south-central Wisconsin is Dinah M. White of rural Fort
Atkinson, with a $1.26 million outstanding tax bill, according to the state Web
site.

And of those with last known addresses in Madison, Dennis E. Harrington's bill
of $411,154 was the largest. Nine others with Madison addresses owed at least a
quarter of a million dollars in back taxes to the state.

It's time for everyone to pay up so that the rest of us don't have to pay more.

System not too harsh on late payments for property taxes

BYLINE: WAYNE WASHINGTON

SECTION: TAMPA & STATE; Pg. 3B

LENGTH: 516 words

DATELINE: TAMPA



Most of Hillsborough County's property tax delinquents don't bother with
excuses or throw themselves on the mercy of the tax collector.

Why would they? Few creditors are as forgiving.

Banks don't normally offer their customers discounts if they make their
payments on time, or let them slide without reporting them to credit bureaus.

But the county's collector does.

"It's important that people not live in fear," explained Hillsborough  Assistant
Tax Collector Tom Stearns.

On Wednesday, Tax Collector Melvin Smith's office published a voluminous  list
of companies and individuals who were late paying their property taxes.
Combined, they owe just more than $ 35-million in delinquent taxes.

None of the five companies the tax collector says owe the most have  contacted
the Tax Collector's Office to explain why they haven't paid up or  even to say
that they will. Their total debt: $ 892,000.

Officials at Capital One Services Inc. of Falls Church, Va., said they  already
have wired the $ 102,000 the company owed.

The Related Capital Cos. of New York is shown as owing Hillsborough  $ 396,000,
more than anyone else.

Bruce Brown, Related Capital's senior vice president, said his company  acquired
the property through foreclosure and that the previous owner had not  paid the
property taxes.

"He dug the hole, and we've been trying to dig out of it," Brown said,  adding
that the taxes will be paid "over the next month or so."

As many homeowners know, taxes are due in November. They are considered  late in
April, when a penalty is imposed.

To encourage prompt payment, Smith offer taxpayers a 4 percent discount if
their payments are early , 3 percent they are a month later, 2 percent two
months later, and 1 percent 90 days later.

Those who haven't paid their property taxes by May find themselves listed  on
the delinquent tax rolls each year.

In June, the county sells certificates to investors based on the amount of
taxes due. The county isn't hurt by delinquent taxes because investors buy the
certificates, filling the gaps delinquent taxes create. Investors earn  interest
on the certificates when the property owners redeem them by paying  their back
taxes and the related fees and interest.

The system, prescribed by Florida law, helps everyone, Stearns said.

But would more people pay their taxes on time if there were more immediate,
stringent repercussions?

County Commissioner Jim Norman said he doesn't know the answer to that  question
but would like to.

"Why aren't we more aggressive?" Norman asked. "Maybe that aggression  would
have diminishing returns, with people going out and getting an attorney  and
contesting it. I don't know. I've never been in the tax collector's  business."

Stearns said companies or individuals who are struggling financially  frequently
determine that it's simply easier to pay the penalties and fines on  late taxes
rather than borrow money to pay them.

"Is it worth it to pay the penalty and the interest?" Stearns said. "It  may
well be at that particular time."

BRIEF: County nets cash at tax auction

BYLINE: Joe LoTemplio, The Press-Republican, Plattsburgh, N.Y.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 234 words


Jul. 5--The properties were sold on June 19 after being foreclosed on by the
county for delinquent taxes.

Residential properties that are four years behind in taxes and vacant land that
is two years behind are foreclosed on by the county and put up for public
auction.

The sale of the 27 properties brought in $226,500. After paying the delinquent
taxes, the county netted $164,645.

The money will go into the county's general fund.

"It was a pretty decent auction," County Treasurer Joseph Giroux said. "The
bidders were not afraid to bid."

Bidders showed up from New York City, North Carolina, New Hampshire, Texas,
Connecticut, Pennsylvania and Maine to purchase property.

Of the 27 properties that were sold, only two sold for less than what was owed
in taxes, Giroux said.

When properties are sold for less than the delinquent tax amount, the
legislature must approve the sale, which they did at Wednesday night's Finance
Committee meeting.

Westside mobile home residents get an extension;
Property owner pays delinquent JEA bill, avoiding utilities cutoff.

BYLINE: JIM SCHOETTLER

SECTION: Pg. B-1

LENGTH: 474 words


Thirteen families living in a ravaged Jacksonville mobile home park got a break
in plans to have their water and sewer service cut next week when the owners
paid a delinquent $4,800 JEA bill late Friday afternoon.

The future of those living in the Westport Mobile Home Park off 103rd Street
remains unclear. Officials with the city and the Sulzbacher Center for the
homeless plan to meet Monday to discuss how to help relocate the families, which
include at least 30 adults and 10 children.

Any assistance would be welcome, said Bonnie Morgan, an 11-year park resident
who has three young grandchildren living next door.

"The fact that it bought us some time is very wonderful. It has taken a 10-ton
brick off my chest," said Morgan, 52. "We're still going to have to get out of
here."

The delinquent bill was paid shortly after the JEA agreed to delay cutting
services to the Westside community for five days while agencies led by
Sulzbacher worked to relocate the residents.

Shortly after the agencies negotiated that agreement, the park's property
manager paid the delinquent $4,874 water and sewer bill, said Gerri Boyce, a JEA
spokeswoman. That two-month delinquency led to the disconnect plans, which were
to be put in place Monday.

Boyce said the JEA scrapped its plans to cut services to the 9-acre park, where
dozens of empty, stripped trailers have been condemned and several occupied
homes have been cited for code and safety violations. The park is facing
foreclosure.

The families faced displacement from the park within 30 days of the JEA cutoff.
Boyce said disconnection procedures would restart if there are further
delinquencies.

The residents' plight was featured in Friday's Times-Union, including interviews
with several people who said they were broke and had nowhere else to live.
Audrey Moran, president of Sulzbacher, said her staff spoke with her Friday
morning after reading the Times-Union story and she then spoke with the city and
JEA about helping the families.

Moran said her agency sought to help because of the number of families facing
potential homelessness.

"Based on the conditions of the trailers, the fact that the company is in
foreclosure and the fact that this landlord racked up a $5,000 JEA bill, those
are all signs this is a development in trouble," Moran said. "We want to be
proactive in helping out those folks."

The park's owners have faced foreclosure since May 2009 after being cited for
owing $1.3 million, court records show. Some residents said they haven't paid
rent for months because nobody has maintained the property, while others paid as
much as $500 within the past month.

The park's property manager told JEA on Monday that the bill hadn't been paid
because of a lack of funds, records show. The owners did not return messages
from the Times-Union.

School board to decide on tax cut;
The budget comes up for a vote Monday. Selling off
delinquent tax accounts brought an influx of cash.

BYLINE: Dan Hardy INQUIRER STAFF WRITER

SECTION: LOCAL NEWS CHESTER COUNTY & THE REGION; Pg. B01

LENGTH: 464 words


A last-minute influx of cash has allowed the Coatesville School District board
to reduce the district's tax rate - the highest in Chester County - when the
final 2005-06 budget is voted on Monday.

The reduction will save $56 for a taxpayer whose home is assessed at the
district's residential average of $111,594. That taxpayer will still pay $3,063
in school taxes.

But the symbolic value of the cut goes far beyond the numbers, school board
members and residents say. It is a sign that the school board is seeking to heal
the wounds left by several years of bitter budget battles.

The announcement was greeted with applause at a school board meeting Monday
night. "I vote yes," shouted board member John Zaleski, signaling his delight
with the move.

The tax cut comes mainly from a onetime infusion of cash that resulted from
selling the district's delinquent tax accounts to a Harrisburg municipal
authority.

The amount of delinquent tax revenue the district will collect over the long
term will actually go down by about 10 percent. But by selling the accounts, the
district will get paid about $7 million this year for the last four years'
delinquencies, instead of having payments dribble in over many years. That's
$2.5 million more than the district had planned on getting from delinquent
-account collections.

District officials said that the tax cut would cost the district about $1.1
million in revenues. An additional $1.5 million from the delinquent tax payment
will go to a reserve fund that can be used to pay for unexpected expenses. The
Coatesville district has had no reserves in recent years; instead it had been
paying off a multimillion-dollar deficit incurred over more than a decade
through the improper allocation of some funds.

The total budget for next school year will be close to $118.8 million.

Cutting taxes instead of raising them or leaving them the same "is very unusual,
particularly in a growing region, where school boards are having a hard time
keeping up with the issues of enrollment and growth," said administrative
services director Joseph Lubitsky of the Chester County Intermediate Unit. "For
most districts, keeping rates flat is already a victory."

The move didn't prevent some residents from seeking a further reduction,
however.

James Caldwell, a longtime campaigner for lower school taxes, asked whether it
would be possible to go further Monday and double the tax cut. When Board
President Cynthia Quinn reminded him the board was reducing taxes by the exact
amount he had asked for previously, Caldwell replied: "I'm going to keep on
pushing" for more reductions.

Said Quinn: "And so should we all."

Tax collectors back on the streets Fulton team out paying calls to collect on
delinquent bills

BYLINE: By Ken Foskett STAFF WRITER

SECTION: LOCAL NEWS; Section B; Page 3

LENGTH: 301 words


With the authority of the sheriff of Nottingham and the manners of Robin Hood,
Roosevelt Ware stood outside a Buckhead mansion on a recent misty morning and
presented the owner with his 1990 property tax bill: $ 30,000 and change.

The amount had been delinquent for more than a year, the address on the bill
belonged to the previous owner, and the current owner said attorneys were
supposed to have settled the account.

"At least we made contact," Mr. Ware, a Fulton County tax collector, said after
the visit. "We have a good address, a good phone number and we've found the
owner. We should be able to get it straightened out."

After a six-year hiatus, Fulton County has put collectors of delinquent taxes
such as Mr. Ware back on the streets. The program was revived in the spring,
well before the magnitude of the county's 1992 budget crisis became apparent.

Now, faced with a $ 32.5 million budget shortfall and determined not to raise
taxes, Fulton officials are anxiously looking to Mr. Ware and his three
colleagues to squeeze every dollar they can from the city's and county's $ 725
million tax digest.

The stakes are high. Delinquent taxpayers owe nearly $ 31 million to Fulton
County and about $ 38.6 million to the city of Atlanta, says Tax Commissioner
Frank Cox, who oversees collection efforts for both governments.

About 60 percent of the money is tied up in real estate taxes, which will
eventually be collected when the property is sold to another owner or possessed
by the county. But the remainder - as much as $ 27 million - is delinquent
personal property taxes, which are much harder to collect, Mr. Cox says.

"I would like to think we can get $ 15 to $ 20 million of that with an
aggressive collection effort," Mr. Cox said. "I think we are in place to do that
now."

Consumers complain about government debt;
CLOSER LOOK

SECTION: MAIN; Pg. A1

LENGTH: 1267 words


State and local government agencies use debt collectors to recover hundreds of
millions of dollars each year in delinquent payments of all kinds - fees, taxes
and fines.

But some consumers have objected to the practice and say some collectors harass
and are deceptive. Consumers have also found that complaints against government
collectors are often made to the very agency that is seeking to collect the
debt.

The Ohio Attorney General's Office, for example, handles debt collection for all
state agencies and institutions. It was the subject of dozens of collections
complaints last year. Ironically, those complaints must be filed with the AG's
office itself. The office had more collections complaints against itself than
nearly any other collector, according to data obtained by this newspaper.

Locally, debt collectors have recovered more than $9 million for the Dayton
Municipal Court millions more for the city of Dayton, in unpaid tickets, fees
and delinquent taxes. But collectors hired by Dayton have a few complaints
against them from people claiming they pursue invalid debts and hound the wrong
people.

State officials and collection firms said not all complaints are legitimate, and
organizations that do large volumes of debt collection may upset some people
while seeking repayment.

But, they say, government officials have a responsibility to taxpayers to try to
collect money owed.

"Our recovery efforts mean taxpayer dollars do not have to go to make up those
holes from unpaid fees, unpaid fines, unpaid taxes," said Dan Tierney, spokesman
with the attorney general.

The city of Dayton hired Capital Recovery Systems in 2010 to collect delinquent
accounts for its finance department including accounts receivable, utility
bills, emergency medical service charges and unpaid income taxes, city documents
show.

The city later contracted a second time with the Columbus-based company for them
to to pursue delinquent red light and speeding fines owed to the city.

Under the agreement with the city, the company receives about 20 to 30 percent
of the money collected, depending on the age of the citation and whether court
action was required.

The company also has collected misdemeanor criminal and traffic fines for Dayton
Municipal Court since 2005. With these they are paid fees, charged to the
debtors, because the court requires it be paid 100 percent of the fines
collected.

Capital Recovery has collected more than $9 million in misdemeanor criminal and
traffic fines for the municipal court, and it has obtained more than $2.7
million for the city of Dayton in unpaid parking, speeding and red light
violations, said Craig Klein, the company's president.

The company's commission for the parking and traffic violations was more than
$500,000, Klein said.

Capital Recovery serves about 200 government clients in Ohio, including about
160 courts.

"We've created a pricing structure where (the courts are) paying basically
nothing, and we pass the costs onto the defendant," Klein said.

Capital Recovery has been effective at getting the municipal court's fines
collected without costing the taxpayers, said Mark Owens, clerk of Dayton
Municipal Court.

"We get paid before Capital Recovery gets paid," he said.

Owens said debtors often must pay court fines and Capital Recovery's fees. But,
he said, the court provides people with payment options and plans. And, he
notes, they should not allow their fines to go to collection in the first place.

The city of Dayton also contracts with the city of Cleveland's Central
Collection Agency to go after outstanding balances and unpaid taxes.

In the last six years, that agency has recovered $1.7 million for Dayton,
charging $320,000 in fees, according to city records.

Public dollars at stake

Debt collection is vital to governments, because they depend on taxes, fines and
fees to pay for essential services, state officials said.

In fiscal year 2014, the Ohio Attorney General collected a record $471 million
for public sector entities, and payments help state hospitals, colleges and
agencies avoid having to raise taxes or fees to balance their budgets, officials
said.

Some of the attorney general's most common collection actions are related to tax
bills, unemployment compensation and workers' compensation payments. Local
governments also can contract with the state to handle debt collection
activities instead of hiring of a private firm.

But some Ohio consumers and businesses have felt harassed or mistreated by
government debt collectors.

There were more than 2,099 complaints about collection agencies filed last year
with the attorney general's consumer protection section including about 234 from
Butler, Champaign, Clark, Greene, Miami, Montgomery and Warren counties.
Complaints have declined statewide for four consecutive years and have dropped
across the region.

But the attorney general received four complaints about Capital Recovery last
year, and it has received about 33 complaints about the firm since 2011,
according to state records.

Consumers complain

In January, Melody Love, 52, of Dayton, contacted the Ohio attorney general
about a letter she received in the mail from Capital Recovery.

The letter warned Love that the city of Dayton would tow her vehicle if she did
not pay $220 in fines from automated red light cameras, she said.

Love said she never received a ticket from the city, and she refuses to pay the
fees.

"I think Dayton is trying to rob the people, and the way they go about
collections is very predatory," she said.

Other consumers have complained that Capital Recovery hounded them about debts
owed by other people whom they do not know.

Some consumers complained the company used robocalls - automated calls with
recorded messages. Others accused the company of deceptive business practices or
providing false information.

One resident said he made a payment to Capital Recovery for an unpaid utility
bill, but the company refused to provide him with proof of payment or
information about the debt he owed, state records show.

Last year, there were also more than 40 collections complaints filed against the
Ohio Attorney General's offic. Only one other supplier of services in the state
had more collections complaints against it.

Consumers also lodged complaints against the Ohio Department of Taxation, the
Internal Revenue Service and other government agencies.

Aletha Boggs, 61, of Dayton, said a Cincinnati law firm representing the
attorney general has demanded she pay thousands of dollars in back state taxes,
as well as interest charges.

Boggs said she has asked the firm and the attorney general to provide detailed
information about how much she owes and how long she will need to make payments.
But she said those requests have been ignored. She said she feels the state is
not being transparent.

"All I want is pertinent information as to what the account is, what I owe and
what the balance is," she said.

The attorney general is the statutory debt collector for all state entities,
though the office farms out some of its debt collections to third parties,
Tierney said.

"It's an important taxpayer protection that we collect this money," he said.

He said the state is not subject to the same regulations as private debt
collectors, but the office voluntarily complies with many of the consumer
protection mandates.

"Just because it is a government debt, consumers should have the same
protections when dealing with the attorney general's office as they would with a
private debt collector," he said.

"Sometimes, the complaint number is a function of how much business you do in
the state of Ohio," Tierney said.

Universal Atlas plant in Penn Hills escapes sheriff's sale

BYLINE: Tony LaRussa

LENGTH: 410 words


The owner of the former Universal Atlas Cement plant in Penn Hills has averted a
sheriff's sale of the property by filing for bankruptcy, according to the
mortgage holder.

Private Capital Group, based in American Fork, Utah, was scheduled to put the
property for sale Monday in the Allegheny County Courthouse for more than $2.07
million, the amount owed on the mortgage.

"The (bankruptcy) filing means the owner has been able to buy some time before
we can attempt to recover the money we are owed," said Jed Robinson, a principal
with Private Capital.

Robinson said Erekson Corp. of Salt Lake City, Utah, only made one payment on a
six-month bridge loan -- a type of short-term loan -- before defaulting. It owes
about $25,000 in delinquent taxes for 2007 and 2008, according to Allegheny
County officials.

Erekson bought the 206-acre abandoned cement plant in the Thompson Run corridor
in 2006 for about $1 million, paying about $500,000 in delinquent taxes on the
property.

James VanTreese, the company's secretary and treasurer, said Tuesday that he is
entertaining several offers and is hoping to generate enough income from the
sale to pay the mortgage, delinquent taxes and other creditors.

"We feel that with a bit of time we can complete a sale that will clear up all
these debts," said VanTreese. "We've got most of the buildings torn down on the
site and the material hauled away, so we've got a considerable investment there.
We'd like to get enough to pay all the bills and at least break even."

When Erekson bought the property VanTreese envisioned a "premiere" development
of about 250 1,700-square-foot, single-family homes selling for $240,000 to
$250,000. About 20 acres of the site was to be set aside for a light industrial
park.

Howard Davidson, head of the Penn Hills Planning Department, said officials were
disappointed that VanTreese was unable to deliver on his promise to develop the
property.

"Mr. VanTreese did a considerable amount of cleanup at the site, so it's in
better shape than it was two years ago," Davidson said. "The site has great
potential, and we would still like to see it developed. We'll be watching the
sale closely and are open to working with the new owner to see something
happen."

Universal Atlas Cement, a former division of U.S. Steel Corp., used the site to
make cement until the early 1980s, when it sold the plant to Lehigh Cement Co.
of Allentown. Lehigh sold the land to MM&G Associates Inc. in 1993.

having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 10-Q for the period

quoted on OTC Link, had five market makers, and was eligible for the "piggyback"

Commission pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(g). Skye International is

their periodic filings with the Commission, have repeatedly failed to meet their
obligations to file timely periodic reports, and failed to heed delinquency
letters sent to them by the Division of Corporation Finance requesting
compliance with their periodic filing obligations or, through their failure to
maintain a valid address on file with the Commission as required by Commission
rules, did not receive such letters.

6. Exchange Act Section 13(a) and the rules promulgated thereunder require
issuers of securities registered pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12 to file

if the registration is voluntary under Section 12(g). Specifically, Rule 13a-1
requires issuers to file annual reports, and Rule 13a-13 requires domestic
issuers to file quarterly reports.

7. As a result of the foregoing, Respondents failed to comply with Exchange Act
Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and/or 13a-13 thereunder.
III.

  In view of the allegations made by the Division of Enforcement, the Commission

deems it necessary and appropriate for the protection of investors that public
administrative proceedings be instituted to determine:

A. Whether the allegations contained in Section II hereof are true and, in
connection therewith, to afford the Respondents an opportunity to establish any
defenses to such allegations; and,

B. Whether it is necessary and appropriate for the protection of investors to
suspend for a period not exceeding twelve months, or revoke the registration of
each class of securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act
of the
Respondents identified in Section II hereof, and any successor under Exchange
Act Rules 12b-2 or 12g-3, and any new corporate names of any Respondents.

IV.

  IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that a public hearing for the purpose of taking
evidence on the questions set forth in Section III hereof shall be convened at a
time and place to be fixed, and before an Administrative Law Judge to be
designated by further order as provided by Rule 110 of the Commission's Rules of
Practice [17 C.F.R. § 201.110].

  IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that Respondents shall file an Answer to
the allegations contained in this Order within ten (10) days after service of
this Order, as provided by Rule 220(b) of the Commission's Rules of Practice [17
C.F.R. § 201.220(b)].

  If Respondents fail to file the directed Answers, or fail to appear at a
hearing after being duly notified, the Respondents, and any successor under
Exchange Act Rules 12b-2 or 12g-3, and any new corporate names of any
Respondents, may be deemed in default and the proceedings may be determined
against them upon consideration of this Order, the allegations of which may be
deemed to be true as provided by Rules 155(a), 220(f), 221(f), and 310 of the
Commission's Rules of Practice [17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a), 201.220(f), 201.221(f),

Commission Rules of Practice.

  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Administrative Law Judge shall issue an
initial decision no later than 120 days from the date of service of this Order,
pursuant to Rule 360(a)(2) of the Commission's Rules of Practice [17 C.F.R. §
201.360(a)(2)].

  In the absence of an appropriate waiver, no officer or employee of the
Commission engaged in the performance of investigative or prosecuting functions
in this or any factually related proceeding will be permitted to participate or
advise in the decision of this matter, except as witness or counsel in
proceedings held pursuant to notice. Since this proceeding is not "rule making"
within the meaning of Section 551 of the Administrative Procedure Act, it is not
deemed subject to the provisions of Section 553 delaying the effective date of
any final Commission action.

  By the Commission.

Alexandria to Crack Down On Unpaid Parking Tickets

Alexandria residents are urged to pay any delinquent parking citation fees
immediately to avoid additional fees and delays in registering vehicles.

Starting April 1, the city will ask the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles to
withhold registration renewals on any vehicle with a delinquent parking citation
fine.

Once a hold is in place, the vehicle owner will have to pay the delinquent
balance, plus a $20 administrative fee per hold, before the DMV will renew the
registration. Three delinquent citation fines also could result in the
immobilization of the vehicle by the police department.

Other Virginia jurisdictions use the DMV's Vehicle Registration Withholding
Program to collect delinquent parking citation fines, the city said in a
release. By expanding its participation in the program, the city hopes to
collect some of the $625,000 in unpaid fines and late penalties on 9,900 parking
citations issued from July 1, 2006, to Nov. 10, 2007.

Lyceum to Host Book Fair With Children's Activities

A children's book fair will be Saturday at the Lyceum museum in Alexandria.

Children will be able to play sleuths on a history scavenger hunt of the Lyceum.
Crafts, story times and "please touch" artifacts will be featured. Dozens of
books will be available for purchase, with an emphasis on social studies and
other educational areas. Book sale proceeds will benefit the museum's programs.

The book fair, 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., is free. The Lyceum is at 201 S. Washington
St. in Old Town.

Agencies on Aging Offer Information Sessions

Alexandria's and Arlington's agencies on aging will have information sessions on
Medicare parts A, B and C and on drug-prescription coverage for those applying
for Medicare for the first time.

Arlington will host a gathering at 2 p.m. Tuesday  at the Arlington Agency on

Water Bills Freeze In Mail;
Delinquent Notices Get Through; City Investigating Mix-Up

Sit tight. That's what Patrick Hopkins, director of administrative services for
Lancaster city, told some city water customers Monday.

City officials say its possible up to 2,000 customers didn't receive water bills
in February. However, those customers recently received delinquent-payment
notices.

In the next few days, city officials will determine how many customers were sent
delinquent notices in error. Those customers will be rebilled, he said. Any late
fees will be waived.

Hopkins said he does not know why some bills mailed in February never made it to
customers.

"That's one of things we're trying to determine," he said. "We have a record of
them being printed, we have the postage meter information, and they were metered
- we're just not sure what happened."

Hopkins said city officials learned of the problem on Thursday after receiving
phone calls from customers who received nonpayment notices.

More calls came in Friday and several more Monday, he said.

Hopkins said it appears the undelivered bills are from the same billing cycle -
the city has 13 - and said all 2,000 or so customers in that cycle could be
affected.

This particular cycle includes customers in such areas outside the city as
Manheim Township, East Lampeter Township and West Lampeter Township.

Hopkins noted that delinquent notices will have no effect on a person's credit
rating.

Help offered owners as 3,300 parcels face delinquent tax auction next week

More than 3,300 properties in Buffalo could be placed on the auction block next
week unless owners pay delinquent tax bills or obtain court orders.

About 2,100 properties on the foreclosure list are homes, while 250 are
commercial properties and the remaining are vacant lots.

The city is teaming with three groups to help people save their properties from
being sold at Buffalo's annual foreclosure auction. For the next three days,
lawyers expect to meet with hundreds of property owners to arrange payment plans
and secure court orders that would bar the parcels from being sold. The sessions
will be held from 9 to 11 a.m. and 2 to 4 p.m. today through Friday at the Erie
County Courthouse at 25 Delaware Ave.

"Our goal is to help people save their properties, if at all possible," said
Assessment and Taxation Commissioner Martin F. Kennedy.

"We're here to help," added Latifa Mack, the city's tax administrator. "The last
thing we want to see is people lose their homes."

Tax officials expect the number of delinquent properties to shrink by as much as
half by the time the three-day auction begins Monday. Last year, just under
1,600 properties were offered for sale, and successful bids were placed on about
600 parcels.

But properties whose owners are delinquent in paying taxes, water bills and
garbage fees will be offered to the highest bidders when the gavel falls in the
Convention Center next week.

The Legal Aid Bureau of Buffalo, Legal Services for the Elderly, Disabled or
Disadvantaged of Western New York and the Volunteer Lawyers Project are working
with the city to try to help homeowners facing foreclosure. The agencies are
focusing on assisting individuals who cannot afford an attorney. But Kennedy
said any residents regardless of their incomes are encouraged to seek
assistance.

The process is fairly simple, Mack said. Attorneys will listen to each
situation, help to determine what the property owner can afford as a down
payment on the debt, then arrange monthly payments. The payment plans will be
submitted to a judge who would be asked for an order that removes the property
from the auction list.

Property owners who pay their debts in full can avoid the need to obtain court
orders. Kennedy said the tax office on the first floor of City Hall is expecting
a flood of visitors.

"It's amazing how many people come in at the last minute to make payments," he
said. "The lines will probably be out the door on Friday."

Officials' delinquent taxes still not paid

BYLINE: CAROL A. MARBIN

SECTION: LARGO-SEMINOLE TIMES; Pg. 1

Pinellas County Commissioner Bruce Tyndall and state Rep.  R. Z. "Sandy" Safley,
R-Clearwater, have yet to pay more than $ 20,000 in delinquent property taxes
and interest for a low-income housing complex they own in Clearwater.

    Tyndall and Safley own the Woodlawn Gardens housing complex at 910 Woodlawn
St., according to state corporation records. The complex is worth $ 783,100,
county property records show.

    The Housing at Woodlawn Gardens Inc., the corporation formed by the two
officials, never paid its 1989 property taxes, which became delinquent April 1,
1990. The 1990 property taxes of $ 16,894, which have not been paid, will become
delinquent April 1, records show.

    In addition, Safley and Tyndall had failed to pay more than $ 15,000 in
delinquent property taxes for land they own in north Pinellas County that also
was due by April 1, 1990. First Florida Bank bought the lots at foreclosure
March 5, and is now responsible for paying the delinquent taxes, Tyndall said.

    "Those are all business obligations; they are tied up in the business
between myself and my partner," said Tyndall, a Republican who lives in Indian
Shores. "There are no funds there to pay (the taxes) unless my partner and I pay
ourselves.

    "This is a business entity, not personal taxes, and I take a different
approach because I don't own 100 percent of either (business venture)," Tyndall
added.

    Safley, a Clearwater Republican, said the taxes went unpaid because two
companies owned by him and Tyndall The Housing at Woodlawn Gardens Inc. and Real
Property Equities Inc.  were in trouble financially.

    First Florida foreclosed on lots owned by Tyndall and Safley, called The
Crossings at Lake Tarpon, because Real Property Equities was unable to make
payments on a loan, Safley said. Safley said they lost more than $ 200,000 in
equity when the bank took  possession of the property.

    "Are we, volunteer public servants who offer ourselves for elected service,
subject to the same economic consequences as the rest of the citizens are?,"
Safley said. "Clearly, the answer is yes.

    "When the economy was perking along and we had 100 percent occupancy (at
Woodlawn Gardens), things were wonderful," Safley added. "That's not the case
now. And we're not insulated from economic downturns just because we seek or do
serve in elected office."

    The Woodlawn Gardens tax bill was paid by BankAtlantic of Fort Lauderdale
after the bank bought a tax certificate for the debt owed by Woodlawn Gardens.
That means Safley and Tyndall will have to pay the taxes and interest to
BankAtlantic not Pinellas County.

    Tyndall also had failed to pay $ 14,000 in personal property taxes due by
April 1990 but paid the bills in August after a reporter questioned him about
the delinquent taxes.

City still in talks on selling tax liens

BYLINE: Kevin Flowers, Erie Times-News, Pa.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 2224 words


Aug. 8--By Kevin Flowers kevin.flowers@timesnews.com City officials and a New
Jersey firm are continuing to negotiate a $2.5 million deal that could help
shrink the city's 2006 budget deficit.

The city is talking with Xspand, a privately owned company that bills itself as
one of the nation's largest purchasers of municipal tax liens.

Erie City Council has given Mayor Joe Sinnott its OK to try to work out a
contract with Xspand, which has offered to buy the city's liens on delinquent
real estate taxes for about 85 cents on the dollar.

City Solicitor Greg Karle and city Finance Director Ron Komorek said no
agreement Xspand has been reached, but talks are ongoing.

"We're still working out terms," Karle said.

Asked if he's confident that the city and Xspand will eventually sign a
contract, Komorek said, "That is my hope and desire, yes. I think it will
occur."

Komorek said the liens are of varying amounts, and have been placed on nearly
3,700 city properties whose owners are late on paying real estate taxes.

The exact amount Xspand originally offered for liens was $2.70 million. But
Komorek said that figure has been adjusted recently to $2.54 million because
officials determined some of the liens are either unenforceable or have been
paid.

Xspand officials could not be reached for comment Monday.

Sinnott and City Council President Rubye Jenkins-Husband have said negotiating a
tax-lien sale could give Erie a cash infusion that would help solve its 2006
money woes.

The city's 2006 deficit is about $1.8 million, although Sinnott said last week
he expects that deficit to shrink to less than $700,000 by year's end, thanks to
additional revenues unrelated to the tax lien sale and spending controls at City
Hall.

The total owed on the delinquent liens is about $3.6 million, including taxes,
penalties and interest, city officials have said.

City officials said Erie County's Tax Claim Bureau would continue to collect
delinquent city real estate taxes under the deal, and delinquent taxpayers would
not be affected by the deal.

Delinquent taxes collected by the bureau would instead go to Xspand, rather than
the city, if a deal can be struck, city officials said.

Timetables for collection would also stay the same.
