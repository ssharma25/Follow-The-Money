Sport Grows With Change In Equipment

BYLINE: By VALERIE CRUICE

SECTION: Section 14CN; Page 19; Column 6; Connecticut Weekly Desk

LENGTH: 362 words


THE change in squash equipment has helped ignite interest in the game for
younger players, said Craig Brand of the United States Squash Racquets
Association of Bala Cynwyd, Pa.

There are now smaller versions of their parent's rackets available and a
beginner's ball that stays in the air longer, making it possible for a child to
more easily reach it.

But it was a fundamental change in the way Americans play the game of squash
that has spurred the growth among junior players, Mr. Brand said. In the mid
1980's the United States switched over from the hard ball to the soft ball that
is used in international competitions.

"The soft-ball game at the entry-level is more forgiving than the hard-ball,"
Mr. Brand said..

According to Kai Neitche, the product manager of the Dunlop Maxfli Sports
Corporation of Greenville, S.C., the company developed the Max Progress and Max
ball and a mini squash ball made of foam for young and beginning players to try
to increase participation. Their mini racket has had brisk sales. Overall squash
racket sales for Dunlop increased 20 percent in 1999.

Wilson now makes junior rackets and Black Knight has a popular junior racket as
well. Junior rackets can cost from $25 to $150.

Squash was said to have evolved from Fleet Prison in London in the early 19th
century and soon it was played in English schools. The game was brought to the
United States by the headmaster of St. Paul's School in Concord, N.H. in 1882.
But because the unheated courts were often below freezing, a harder rubber ball
was developed. In the mid 1980's, hardball play gave way to the international
soft ball.

Mr. Brand said there are now outreach programs designed to increase interest in
the sport.

"The most notable is Squashbusters, started by Greg Zaff in the Roxbury section
of Boston," Mr. Brand said. "It combines squash and academics. It's remarkable
and highly successful." There is also a program in New York called Citisquash.

"It's changing" said Paul Assiante, the men's coach at Trinity College. "For
years and years it came from the upper demographic. You're seeing more squash
spread out publicly in this country."

RACKETS;
A BIGGER HIT

BYLINE: Rachel Shuster

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 14C

LENGTH: 412 words



''The choice of a racket is an important matter, and it is also a difficult one.

''Young players seem to take pleasure in selecting the most extraordinary
rackets in the shop. Let me strongly advise them to avoid all unusual handles,
heads or methods of stringing.

''All these eccentricities are useless at the best. Nothing is so good as the
simplest form of racket, possessing an octagonal handle, and strung in the usual
way. Such a racket is used by all the better match players in England.

''Opinions differ as to what the exact size of the head should be, but it is
certain that there is nothing to be gained by having it square or triangular.''
- James Dwight, Lawn-Tennis, 1886

 NEW YORK - When Jimmy Connors, that stalwart of the old T-2000 steel tennis
racket, switches to a new racket for the U.S. Open, people pay attention.

Connors, Martina Navratilova and other pros are caught up in the newest tennis
revolution: The wide-body racket. And there's growing opinion that many of us
will want to make the switch, too.

The wide body is a version of the conventional midsize racket. Its added width
makes the racket stiffer than the midsize, meaning the ball will bounce off the
strings with more energy, more drive.

A good player gets more power, but the casual hacker benefits, too. Players
won't lose as much power if the ball doesn't hit the sweet spot.

''The wide bodies have delivered a real sense of excitement and impact within
the tennis community,'' says Neil Amdur, editor of World Tennis magazine. ''The
reason people left the game years ago was because they weren't improving. Now
the wide bodies are helping people play a little better, giving them some
motivation.''

And what a rage it is. A walk through the congested pro-shop areas at the U.S.
Open this week is testimony to the variety of tennis rackets available to
players of all skill levels.

Wilson. Yonex. Prince. Displays galore. But the wide body is front and center,
the racket of choice for the player in the know.

''Tennis had that huge popularity boom in the '70s, and the designers of rackets
responded,'' says Jan Armstrong, curator of the International Tennis Hall of
Fame in Newport, R.I.

''Now, maybe not as many are playing, but the general trend is toward tennis
players becoming more athletic in their sport. People wouldn't be switching
rackets if they didn't feel it would give them an advantage.''

Collectors get in the swing of tennis

BYLINE: Danielle Arnet

LENGTH: 875 words


Danielle Arnet has been writing about collectibles for USA TODAY and the Chicago
Sun-Times for more than six years. In this occasional column, she answers
collecting questions of general interest, tells how to get more information on a
collecting topic and alerts collectors to trends and events of interest. Send
collecting-related questions to Collecting, USA TODAY, P.O. Box 2279, Homewood,
Ill. 60430.

Q: How can I sell my collection of antique tennis rackets? Many are shown in old
tennis catalogs, which I also have.
- Ken Roush, Monticello, Ind.

A: According to several tennis collectors, tennis will become the next big
sports collectible.

Your rackets - and the catalogs - might sell very well, assuming they're the
right stuff.

Jay Zirolli, an Enfield, Conn., industrial engineer and tennis enthusiast, has
collected tennis memorabilia for about six years. Today, along with a collection
of trophies, balls, paper memorabilia, cans and so forth, he has 230 rackets.
The total collection? Close to 500 pieces.

Another collector, Ralph Nix, a Red Bay, Ala., dentist and competition player,
has 300 rackets dating from the 1890s to now.

But before you get too excited, remember: Not all old rackets are collectible,
at least so far.

Zirolli pegs a standard 1920s or 1930s wood racket at $ 20. Pre-1900 lawn
rackets, dating from 1874 when lawn tennis was introduced in the USA, sell for $
200 to $ 700. Because few English rackets from that period survive here today,
they are even more sought after.

"It's not brands, it's types" that are valuable as collectors' items, Zirolli
says. Among the desirables:

- A flat-top racket made before the turn of the century.

- 1880s-1930s models fashioned with a slight bubble-like extension onto the head
from the handle shaft.

- Rackets from the 1880s-90s made with crosshatching cut into the handle sides
for a better grip "like a pistol handle," Zirolli says.

- 1880s-1910 English fishtail rackets, which have a handle end that resembles a
mermaid's tail.

- Most prized is a rarely found angled-head racket from the 1880s: It has a
teardrop head set into the handle at an angle. Zirolli spotted two last summer
at a Massachusetts auction, where they sold for $ 1,000 apiece.

For such very old rackets, condition - and the fact that they survived at all -
are keys to their high value. Zirolli explains it in terms of another pricey
sports collectible. "Golf items were different. If a wood shaft broke, it could
be replaced," he says. "When a tennis racket broke, it was pitched. That's why
there are fewer old rackets around for collectors today."

Standards for collecting are somewhat flexible in the case of fine old rackets,
Zirolli says. "An excellent racket has original strings, which are not frayed or
broken. The wood finish should have a patina on it but be intact. If there were
decals, they should be complete. Handwritten gold markings appeared on rackets
as early as the late 1890s." Some may have a maker's mark and model number
stamped in the wood.

If the frame is rare, Zirolli would allow restringing for display purposes only;
for sale, where pristine condition counts, it wouldn't be allowed. There isn't
much printed information available on collecting antique rackets, he says, but
that may change as the hobby goes big time.

"Tennis collecting is just beginning to blossom," Nix says. "Wooden rackets
aren't made anymore, and in the future, they'll be harder and harder to find."

"It will take off money-wise like golf collecting has," Zirolli predicts.

In fact, he has a lament about that. Golf items have become so expensive and
hard to come by that people who had dealt in them are branching out. "Golf
dealers are now buying tennis items, which makes more competition for me and
other collectors. Five years ago, I could buy a racket for $ 5 to $ 10. Now it's
$ 50 to $ 60. Just talk to people who buy sports items. They'll tell you tennis
is getting so hard to come by."

Does that mean the qualifications for being a collectible will relax? Zirolli
admits some collectors are picking up rackets from the 1950s and '60s from
makers such as Wilson, Spalding and Bancroft "because they like their looks, or
they like the period, or to hold onto while they appreciate." But Zirolli
remains a purist: "To me, they're junk - just something you'd find for $ 5 at a
tag sale."

Serving up tennis history

In the big leagues, tennis memorabilia sells at major auctions and to an
international group of serious collectors. Collector Jay Zirolli belongs to an
England-based group that publishes The Tennis Collector.  For information,

Decision when picking racket focuses on power vs.  control

BYLINE: Doug Smith

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 12C

LENGTH: 556 words


Like the TV ad featuring beer drinkers torn between great taste or less filling,
aspiring tennis players must choose between rackets that promise more power or
better control.

"Control should take precedence," says Tom Gullikson, U.S. Davis Cup captain and
U.S. Tennis Association player-development program coach. "That's with the
exception of senior players who might be losing a little power or women players
who might want to put a little more pop on the ball.

"Serve-and-volleyers should lean toward a stiffer racket, while rackets with
more flexibility are better for ground-strokers.

"People just starting should buy an entry-level racket that's not too expensive,
something flexible as opposed to stiff."

Last year, Wilson proved to be the players' choice among pros (including No. 1
Pete Sampras) and amateurs. About 40% of all rackets sold last year were made by
Wilson.

"Our strength at the top (among pros) is pretty high," said John Embry, a Wilson
spokesman. "But we've done the right thing in making products the average player
likes and can play better with."

Wilson's best sellers: Hammer 6.2 ($ 160), Sledge Hammer 3.8 ($ 319) and the Pro
Staff Classic ($ 199). Embry said the lighter Hammer (9 1/2 ounces) and Sledge
Hammer (8 7/8 ounces) models generate extra power because most of the weight is
in the head of the racket. (Average racket weight: 12 ounces)

Rick Margin, a Prince spokesman, said its global best seller, the $ 249 Extender
Thunder (9 1/8 ounces), is the most powerful racket in tennis.

"We're not quibbling about Wilson being No. 1 in the U.S., but we're No. 1 in
the world."

Research by Bill Lawliss of Sports Research Inc. in Princeton, N.J., had Prince
a strong second to Wilson in U.S. racket sales last year, with Head, Dunlop and
ProKENNEX further behind. Lawliss says racket sales have declined 20% the last
two years.

"There's been a lack of technical innovation in the last three years," Lawliss
said.

But Tony Lovitt, ProKENNEX spokesman, says the firm's newest racket, the $ 250
Kinetic (11 ounces), available in the USA last fall, disproves the notion of an
absence of new racket technology.

"It's breakthrough technology," Lovitt said.

The Kinetic, unlike other rackets, absorbs energy upon contact with the ball,
then releases it when the ball leaves the strings, Lovitt says.

Racket maker hopes to shine at U.S. Open

DATELINE: LYON, France

LYON, France -- Behind the scenes at the U.S. Open, which starts today in New
York, there is another cutthroat competition.

The market for tennis equipment makers is fierce, and the stakes are higher:
This is a $345 million game in the United States alone, where sales can soar if
the Open winner is using your racket.

The Wilson nCode nSix-One tennis racket in the hands of No. 1-ranked Roger
Federer could go up against the Babolat Pure Drive Plus, swung by Andy Roddick,
the defending U.S. Open champion. Among the women, defending champ Justine
Henin-Hardenne is armed with a Wilson H Tour. No. 2-ranked Kim Clijsters wields
a Babolat Pure Drive.


A win could be particularly important for Babolat. Outside pro shops, few in the
USA have heard of the small, family-owned French company.

While Babolat has dominated the market for strings since tennis rules were
written in 1875, the company didn't start selling rackets until 1998 and not in
the USA until 2000. It had just five players in the international circuit under
contract six years ago. Today, it has about 150, plus a couple of thousand
smaller, national contracts.

Overcoming odds

Like so many good stories about sports stars, Babolat's tale is one of
overcoming adversity, coping with tragedy, meeting the test of endurance and
having a little bit of luck.

"In terms of market share, Babolat is a relatively minor player in the U.S.
market," says James Martin, senior editor of Tennis magazine. "But their growth
is impressive. No other company in recent memory has created so much buzz,
generated primarily by getting their blue Pure Drive Team (rackets) in the hands
of stars like Andy Roddick and Kim Clijsters. Usually, racket endorsements have
little to no effect on sales, but this is one case where it's had a huge
impact."

When the story began, the city of Lyon was famous throughout Europe for
craftsmen, including Pierre Babolat, who made musical instruments. Babolat was
renowned for his musical strings made from sheep intestines. When the game of
tennis was born, the first racket maker asked Babolat to make a musical string,
only longer.

Even today, Babolat is the only major tennis company making natural gut strings
(now made from cow intestines), preferred by almost half of the players at the
U.S. Open. Though they cost three to five times more than nylon strings, the
collagen in natural-gut strings gives them more flexibility.

Still, the advent of synthetic strings in the 1950s was a threat to Babolat's
fortunes. Tennis players snapped them up because they were cheaper and lasted
longer. Wood rackets also became obsolete with the invention of high-tech
graphite. The new rackets didn't break often, so again, players needed fewer
sets of strings.

Pierre's grandson, Paul, had no choice but to match the competition if the
company was to survive.

"I remember my grandfather saying, 'That's not the product. Natural gut is the
product.' But we needed to do that because the market was changing," says Paul's
grandson, Eric Babolat, now the fifth-generation Babolat to hold the chief
executive's job.

A new racket

Then, in the 1990s, tennis had lost some of its bounce and sales were falling
30% a year. "The tennis game was still there, but the phenomenon was not,"
Babolat says. "My father's feeling was there is a big risk we will become an
accessory company."

So Eric's father, also named Pierre, bet on rackets. "Everybody thought Babolat
was crazy," the CEO recalls. Even by today's numbers, the proposition is
daunting. Competitors like Wilson have four times Babolat's sales and 15 times
as many employees.

Nevertheless, in 1994, Babolat made its first racket. In 1998, Carlos Moya won
the French Open playing with a Babolat.

But the celebration turned into mourning three months later when Pierre was
killed in the crash of Swiss Air Flight 111 off Nova Scotia, Canada. Eric, then
28 with just four years' experience in the company's marketing department, was
thrust onto center court.

"My father died at 51. My father wasn't thinking about his successors. He never
raised me to say I'd be next. He always said, 'You never know what will be,' "
Eric Babolat says. Running Babolat was "something that came naturally, but it
was not expected. I think it was the same for all generations."

Two years after taking over, Eric Babolat launched Babolat rackets in the USA.
With an average retail price of $179 to $199, Babolat targets the pro shops and
once-a-week players.

The strategy also serves the company because this is where corporate talent
scouts find the best players -- the future U.S. Open winners.

Babolat spied Andy Roddick at the 1998 U.S. Open playing juniors doubles.
Despite his low ranking at the time, the company gave him a generous contract.
"These players, when they grow up playing with one of these rackets, they don't
switch lightly," says John Horan, publisher of Sporting Goods Intelligence
newsletter.

The company not only had a good eye for talent, it also had a lucky break: "The
racket Andy is using, one of the first rackets we did, at the beginning was made
for leisure-women's playing," says Babolat, who only has time to play once a
month. "We never imagined this racket would go into competition. At that time,
the game was changing, and we did not know in what direction. Suddenly, young
competitors used light rackets with lots of weight in the end."

Since Babolat introduced its first racket, sales have more than doubled, and
rackets now account for half the company's sales. But Babolat doesn't have the
distribution power of the Big Three -- Wilson, Head and Prince -- which cover
the retail shelves of the big sporting goods stores in the USA. And the
family-owned company has no plans to go public.

"Maybe it's a David and Goliath story," Eric Babolat says.

Still, the company continues to widen its niche. Last year, it introduced an
apparel line and its first tennis shoe, with a sole made by Michelin, the French
tiremaker. The clothes and shoes are expected to hit U.S. stores next year.

Players grip big racquets

DATELINE: ST. PETERSBURG



ST. PETERSBURG - In racquetball, mid-size racquets are the rage.

     "Larger equates with better. A larger sweet spot is more    advantageous
and the sweet spot tends to follow size," said Mike    Skinner, marketing
manager for indoor racquet sports for HEAD in    Boulder, Colo. "With a larger
racquet you will have considerably more    contact. There is 25 percent more
space on a mid-sized racquet than the    conventional racquet."

     Tennis racquets made the move to mid-size a few years ago, while
mid-size racquetball racquets have become popular in the past year or    so. In
addition to a larger "sweet spot" - the area in the middle of    the racquet -
bigger racquets give players more power.

     "A larger frame results in more power and more reach," said    Sergio
Gonzalez, the No. 1 amateur player in Florida and the pro at the    Tyrone
Racquet Club & Fitness Center Inc. "The trend in the sport of    racquetball
seems to be the power game so players have to make the    adjustment."

     Not only are the size of racquets changing, the composition is    different
these days. Companies use such materials as graphite, boron    and ceramics to
give players control as well as power. The new mid-size    racquets range in
price from about $ 24 to about $ 170, and they're big    sellers in the area.

     "During the past year we have been selling the mid-sized racquets    at a
five-to-one ratio compared to our oversized and traditional    racquets," said
Rob Emanuel, manager of the golf, tennis and racquet    department at Suncoast
Sports Unlimited in Clearwater.

     Chris McElvy, manager of Alice's What A Racquet Sports Shop in St.
Petersburg, has had similar success selling the racquets. "Our    mid-sized
racquets have been out selling other racquets four to one,"    he said.      But
despite the many pluses of using bigger racquets, there are    some drawbacks.

     "Larger racquets can be detrimental for players in corner    situations,"
Skinner said. "With a bigger racquet you don't have as    much flexibility and
maneuverability to go after the ball in the    corner."

     "With a larger racquet you will have to learn better control,"    Gonzalez
said. "While using a bigger frame, your arm will take more of    a beating and
absorb more shock."

     But these problems aren't keeping scores of players from buying the
racquets. As the pros say, the name of the game is power - and mid-size
racquets can help you pound the ball against the wall even harder.

What's all the racket about?;
Is technology the monster or the partner on ad court?

BYLINE: Douglas Robson

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 1C

LENGTH: 1759 words


Novak Djokovic held it lightly, feeling the contours as if he were examining a
T. rex bone at a natural history museum.

To be fair, the Wilson Jack Kramer Autograph tennis racket is a dinosaur.

"It's the first time in my life" to hit with it, said Djokovic, born in 1987,
long after wood joined the museum shelves of tennis history. The fifth-ranked
player in men's professional tennis who competes with a Wilson nBlade graphite
racket added, "Now I realize how tough for the players it was 30-40 years ago to
play."

During the last three decades, racket technology has advanced astronomically.
The sizes, shapes, materials and performance of the main tool of tennis, on
display Monday as the fortnight of Wimbledon begins, are nothing like they were
two or three generations ago.

To understand these technological changes and help shape the debate about
increasing power in tennis, USA TODAY enlisted nearly a dozen top pros to hit
the 1970s-era wood rackets. They were supplied by the Newport, R.I.-based
International Tennis Hall of Fame.

The wonderment Djokovic experienced brings to mind how the generation of Rod
Laver and wood rackets gave way in the 1970s to Jimmy Connors and his metal
T2000. Next came the stronger, lighter, bigger, more powerful frames used today.

Laver, the last man to win all four Grand Slam tournaments in a single year,
said it "just wasn't that big of a deal" when the metal era arrived. Perhaps
not. But it definitely grabbed everyone's attention.

So did our hitting experiments in March at the Pacific Life Open in Indian
Wells, Calif., and the Sony Ericsson Open in Key Biscayne, Fla.

It wasn't quite like Bode Miller barreling down the slopes on wooden skis
without release bindings or Lance Armstrong tackling the Alpe d'Huez on a
three-speed bike. But almost across the board, it was an eye-opening experience.
Many, including Djokovic, had never played with wood.

"It feels like a different game out there, to be honest," 2005 U.S. Open
semifinalist Robby Ginepri said. "It doesn't give the pop or the spin that the
graphite rackets have today."

It would be "almost impossible (to win a match on tour) unless your opponent
misses every single shot," 18-year-old Vania King, one of the USA's more
promising players, said while laughing.

Although most could hit proficiently after a few minutes, the pros noted a
significant decrease in power and spin and a diminished sweet spot. Only one
player, 2004 U.S. Open champ Svetlana Kuznetsova, felt confident enough in her
strokes with a wood racket that she could win a match on tour.

"Your chances of missing are a lot higher," top-10 player Tommy Robredo of Spain
said. "That racket doesn't get much spin. ... If I played with a racket like
this, for sure I would have a lot more touch, because you cannot play with
power. You have to play with other things" such as spin.

It's a far cry from today's rackets, which, depending on your point of view,
have helped democratize the sport or dumbed-down technique and given way to
brute force.

"I love the new rackets because they have made, and kept, tennis fun for players
of all abilities," said pioneer Billie Jean King, who won the 1967 U.S. National
Championships (which became the Open in 1968) with a then-new metal frame.

Wood good for touch, technique

Players trying the old rackets felt they had less maneuverability with wood,
which is 25% to 40% heavier than modern frames. In many cases, they were forced
to alter their grips and flatten their strokes to hit the ball cleaner because
the hitting area of the older frames is considerably smaller (80 square inches
vs. 90 to 120-plus square inches).

But a few players noticed more "feel" with wood.

"I tried a drop shot, and I knew exactly where it was going to go," said Mike
Bryan, who, with twin brother Bob, is part of the top-ranked doubles team in the
world. "You can feel it all the way to your hand through the wood."

"Definitely for the feel and touch, it's great," 10th-ranked Daniela Hantuchova
of the Czech Republic said.

But using the wood also led some to observe how much easier the game has become
with today's technology.

"You have to have very good technique to play with this one," Russian Kuznetsova
said of the wood.

"Technology can hide flaws in your game," Bob Bryan said.

Hall of Famer and TV commentator John McEnroe agreed. Comparing the power surge
in rackets and strings to modern-day baseball, he said, "If they had some of the
equipment we have in tennis, they'd be hitting the ball 700 feet."

"I'm 48 now, and I hit my serve harder than when I was 25," added the three-time
Wimbledon champion, who transitioned from regulation wood to midsized graphite
over the course of his pro career in the 1970s and '80s.

"It's gone way too far."

Tools become artifacts

Carrying around three antiquated rackets -- Jack Kramer, Spalding Pancho
Gonzales Autograph and Wilson Stan Smith Autograph -- at a pro tennis tournament
is akin to driving a shiny 1920s-era Cadillac into the parking lot.

Heads turn. Passersby stop and stare. People approach and want to handle them or
share stories of a bygone era.

Standing in line at the food court at the Sony Ericsson Open, Susan Mueller of
Miami rushed up. "Where did you get those?" the 70-year-old asked.

Mueller has collected wood rackets for years from bargain sales, antique stores
and estate sales. She has 55 displayed in her playroom at home.

Some just couldn't avoid the sarcasm when they noticed the old-time rackets.

"Good luck with those!" one said.

But most were fascinated and nostalgic. "Oh wow, I remember playing with wood"
was a common refrain.

Crowds gathered to watch today's pros hit with yesterday's relics. Many snapped
photos.

Tennis insiders, though, say it is just nostalgia.

"Advances in racket technology have in many ways enhanced the entertainment
value of tennis by enabling players to do things with the ball that they
couldn't do 10 or 20 years ago," said Larry Scott, CEO of the women's Sony
Ericsson WTA Tour.

In many respects, tennis mirrors the inevitable march of progress in all sports
as equipment, fitness and athleticism improve.

Stuart Miller, technical manager for the International Tennis Federation (ITF),
which oversees testing and regulations in tennis, said space-age materials such
as boron compounds, graphite and Kevlar have made rackets bigger, lighter and
stiffer. That and improved manufacturing processes allow players to swing
harder, better manage off-center hits and generate more spin.

"It has unlocked many performance advantages," Miller said.

Nine-time Wimbledon champ Martina Navratilova, however, blames the tennis
industry -- $108million in U.S. racket sales last year, according to the Tennis
Industry Association -- for boosting the power quotient as it endeavors to
produce more powerful rackets for pros and amateurs.

"Racket manufacturers are dictating the type of rackets we are seeing today,"
Navratilova said.

Until the late 1970s, governing authorities in tennis took a laissez-faire
approach to racket technology, leaving the design and dimensions open to the
whims of players and manufacturers.

"You can play with a tomato can on a broomstick if you think you can win with
it," U.S. Tennis Association President "Slew" Hester Jr. said in 1977.

Tennis has periodically imposed rules on racket technology in response to
advances that seem to threaten the integrity of the sport. That can only go so
far.

"You can't un-ring a technology bell in any sport," former tennis pro and TV
sports commentator Mary Carillo said. "I have a hard time renouncing technology
the way a lot of people do. There are all kinds of ways to frame the argument
for or against it."

String to swing bigger

Indeed, rackets aren't the only factor that has contributed to the increase in
power and speed, according to players.

Better strength and athleticism are backing up juiced-up rackets. Many male pros
launch serves in excess of 130mph with regularity. The women, too, have jumped
on the power bandwagon. Venus Williams holds the serve speed record at 128 mph.

Some cited synthetic strings as a  reason for today's baseline-hugging style, in
which  winners can be launched from deep in the backcourt. The strings bite into
the ball more, which allows for bigger swings with more margin for error.

"You couldn't really generate as much spin as with the newfangled rackets," U.S.
teen King said of playing with wood.

The Bryans said their volleys with wood felt almost the same as with today's
rackets. But like several other players, they said serving and hitting
groundstrokes were compromised.

"You only get 50%-60% of your normal power," said Bob Bryan, who nonetheless
would like to see a "cap" on some of the advancements in racket technology.

Others are more resigned to technological advances.

"That's the evolution of the sport," five-time Grand Slam champ Martina Hingis
said. "It's hard to stop that."

But Djokovic can envision a dystopian Brave New World where players are
secondary to technology.

"I'm imagining myself standing next to the court and (having a) robot in-stead
of me play with the racket, like PlayStation," he said with a laugh.

Who tried it

A sampling of player observations on using a wood racket in the USA TODAY
experiment:

No. 5-ranked Svetlana Kuznetsova: "You have to hit it harder, but (you also get)
bigger control. ... I like playing with this."

No. 45 Robby Ginepri: "My arm is already hurting, and I was only hitting for 10
minutes. ... With my grip -- it's pretty extreme -- it's hard to get through the
ball with the wood."

No. 9 Martina Hingis: "At first I thought also I would have a harder time to
actually hit the balls. ... I think I'd come in a lot more (to the net) with
this one."

No. 1 doubles Mike Bryan: "I was surprised by how much feel there was. I can see
why they all used ... (the) same grip for every shot."

No. 77 Thomas Johansson: "It's a different feeling. The head of the racket is a
lot smaller. ... I think I could (serve 125 mph) or over  with natural gut."

No. 1 doubles Bob Bryan: "The new rackets let you hit more (of a) variety of
shots. ... Those guys (from the previous generation) would have been phenomenal
with the new technology."

No. 10 Daniela Hantuchova: "It was coming off the racket pretty well. ... I
always thought I'd be quite good playing maybe 100 years ago (laughs)."

No. 7 Tommy Robredo: "We would not play like the clay-court players with all the
spin. We would play maybe like (Fabrice) Santoro or a Czech guy that always play
flat. The rackets we are using now, they are a lot better for us."

Tennis, Anyone? Better Bring a Helmet

BYLINE: By CAROL LAWSON

SECTION: Section C;  Page 1;  Column 3;  Living Desk

LENGTH: 900 words


RECREATIONAL tennis players, beware: the game is going ballistic.

At a time when the tennis industry and many players themselves are slowing down,
racquet manufacturers say they have figured out what the weekend warriors of the
sport really need: racquets that are big yet lightweight, and sure to hit the
ball no matter what.

Forget about love matches. This is the age of the Rambo racquet.

With names like Sledge Hammer, Big Bang and Extender Thunder, they barely look
like tennis racquets.

"The head shape is the new battleground of tennis," said Ian Arthur, director of
marketing for Head Sports Inc., manufacturer of the "fan shaped" Big Bang, which
will go on sale in mid-August.

The "egg shaped" Extender Thunder, made by Prince Sports Group Inc., arrived in
stores in June. Another "fan shaped" model, the Sledge Hammer, from Wilson
Sporting Goods, has been on the market nearly a year, and retailers say it is
selling well.

Head Sports does not disclose sales figures, but Mark Mason, the owner of
Mason's Tennis Mart in Manhattan, calls the Sledge Hammer "the most popular
racquet" in his store.

While manufacturers toss around terms like "fan shaped" and "egg shaped," some
tennis players have other descriptions for the new racquet heads, like
"snowshoe" and "club."

To Stuart Chirls, an associate editor of Tennis magazine, the Sledge Hammer is
"triangular." In any case, he said, "strangely shaped racquets are definitely a
trend."

These strange new racquets are also big -- as big and even bigger than the
oversize racquet (110 square inches), which demolished the notion of a
standard-sized racquet (about 85 square inches) when it was introduced in 1975.
The Extender Thunder head, which is the largest of the three new racquets, with
122 square inches of hitting area, looks like an oval that has been pumped up,
elongated and squeezed at the bottom. The heads of the Big Bang (111 square
inches) and the Sledge Hammer (110 square inches) are wide and nearly straight
across at the top and very narrow at the bottom.

But despite their size, the racquets are extremely lightweight. They are made of
graphite or graphite composites and weigh less than other recreational models.
The Sledge Hammer and Big Bang weigh 9.2 ounces, strung, and the Extender
Thunder is 9.4 ounces. Wooden racquets, by contrast, weigh 13 to 15 ounces.

The new racquets are "game enhancement products," in tennis-industry language.
Manufacturers say that since recreational players hit most balls with the top
part of the racquet, they have widened the head in order to enlarge the sweet
spot, the hoped-for hitting surface. Mr. Chirls says the new designs create
"more usable hitting surface" for the recreational player, especially one with
sagging arms and slowing legs, and "turn mis-hits into good hits."

Although professional tennis players are permitted by the International Tennis
Federation to use oversize racquets in major tournaments, none are expected to
use these particular models because they lack sufficient control. "These
racquets generate power, but they are not finesse racquets," Mr. Mason said.

Jackie Silver, a marketing consultant in Manhattan, has been playing with a
Sledge Hammer since last November. "It makes me more aggressive," she said.

Kibbe Fitzpatrick, an interpreter at the United Nations, liked the Sledge Hammer
so much that he bought two. But now he is disenchanted.

"I can hit beautiful ground strokes," Mr. Fitzpatrick said. "But I can't hit
overhead and serve.  The racquet doesn't have enough power."

Heather Kinsella, a communications manager for Wilson, said she had not heard
that complaint.  But Mr. Chirls of Tennis Magazine said that since weight had
been redistributed from the handle to the head of the new racquets, they
required "extra effort" for serves and overhead shots.

Paul Wolsk, a Manhattan lawyer, said the Sledge Hammer tipped the balance in his
weekly tennis game with Richard Lukins, a Manhattan businessman. When Mr. Lukins
lost his racquet, he borrowed a Slege Hammer from the tennis club.

"He was whacking and cracking the ball, and I didn't win a single game in three
sets," Mr. Wolsk said. But he is not all that impressed. "Everybody likes to
play with new racquets," he said. "But they are like diets: your old game comes
back eventually."

The suggested retail price for Extender Thunder and Big Bang is $250, unstrung.
The Sledge Hammer costs $289. None of these new racquets come close to the
biggest racquet on the market, the Weed, which is 135 square inches. Weed U.S.A.
Inc., in Columbus, Ohio, began making racquets in 1975 and now manufactures
fewer than 2,000 a year for a devoted clientele that includes Regis Philbin, the
entertainer. He says he is not interested in head shapes, sweet spots or other
technicalities: Size is all.

"Let me tell you, the psychological edge the Weed gives you is phenomenal," Mr.
Philbin said. "My opponents know they are beaten even before the first serve."

Where will racquets go from here? Will they get even bigger? Will head shapes
become even stranger?

Tennis's past has a great future, said Bob Morgan, who runs the three C. C.
Morgan Tennis Shops in northwestern Connecticut. "Racquets are going to get
smaller, rather than bigger," he predicted. "It's like hemlines: you can only go
so far with a certain look, and then you have to go the other way."

USA Adult League titles up for grabs

BYLINE: NANCY MORGAN

SECTION: LARGO TIMES; TENNIS; Pg. 4

LENGTH: 917 words



USA Adult League playoffs conclude Saturday in three women's and three men's
divisions. Winners will advance to regional play in July with hopes of
continuing to the state tournament.

In women's competition, East Lake Woodlands Country Club is challenging for two
division championships, one in 4.0 and the other in 3.5. Its opponents for the
district championships are Treasure Island Tennis and Yacht Club in 4.0 and the
Renaissance Vinoy in 3.5. Both Treasure Island and the Vinoy are unbeaten, as is
East Lake's 4.0 team.

"It's going to be a difficult match for both teams," said Jeanne Curran, East
Lake's 4.0 captain. "We have a little edge because we beat them (Treasure
Island) in the season, but it will be close. We're positive and looking forward
to playing. We'll give it our best."

East Lake has relied on the singles play of Margaret Modjeski and Karen Dutter
and has utilized its 11 other players in doubles.

"We didn't steamroll any teams during the season to earn 5-0 wins," said Curran,
"but we did get everyone to play. Also, since we won all of our matches, we have
the home-court advantage, which should help us Saturday."

In the third women's division, Feather Sound Country Club's unbeaten 3.0 squad
faces the Vinoy. A Feather Sound win would clinch the title; a loss would force
a tiebreaker.

Also scheduled to play Saturday but not in contention for titles are the Racquet
Club at Bardmoor in 4.0, Innisbrook at Feather Sound in 3.5, and East Lake at
Crescent Oaks in 3.0.

In men's competition, the Royal Racquet Club vs. Racquet Club of St. Petersburg
match at the Racquet Club facility will determine the 4.5 district champion.
Likewise, Saturday's Bardmoor-Racquet Club match at Bardmoor will name the 4.0
winner. In the 3.0 division, Royal Racquet Club could be the spoiler for the
Racquet Club with a win, and could force a tiebreak situation for either
Bardmoor or Countryside depending on that winner.

"We split with the Racquet Club in the regular season," said Bill Christensen,
Royal Racquet Club's 4.5 captain. "Saturday's match should be a pretty close
one. I feel really good about our team chances, though, and think our doubles
teams are about as strong as they can be. I think we've peaked at the right
time."

Royal's team has had the luxury of more than the minimum number of singles
players, said Christensen, and, as a result, has been able to allow other
players to develop into strong doubles teams.

Joining Saturday's winners as district champions are the women's 4.5 McMullen
and 5.0 Safety Harbor Spa teams, and the men's 3.0 Feather Sound Country Club
and 5.0 Treasure Island Recreation Center teams. Regional competition is July
23-25 at Longboat Key.

JUNIORS AT STATE: Michael Murray is the area's top seeded player at No. 1 in the
boys 18-and-under division of this weekend's State Closed Championships. Murray
is joined by No. 6 Kyle Nelson, No. 8 Aleksay Bubis and No. 9 Reinaldo Valor in
a field of 128.

Alexandria Liles is the highest seeded player among area girls at No. 4 in the
16s. Also seeded are Nicole Cercone (No. 10 in the 18s), George Navas (No. 6 in
the 12s), R.J. Murray (No. 10 in the 16s) and Ryan Buchanan (No. 15 in the 14s).

Other local girls in the state singles championships are Savita Iyer, Sydnie
Zillig and Kristin Rannala in the 18s; Natalie Tirapelli, Jennifer Dent, Kelly
Nelson, Tiffanie Kalvoda and Jenna Ruth in the 16s; Bugsy Bauer, Loren Butler,
Kaela Kennedy and Katie Fenzl in the 14s, and Rachel Silverberg and Elena Berry
in the 12s.

Others in the boys divisions are Jeswin Jolly, Jonathan Brett and Kris Goddard
in the 18s; Bryan Lauer, Lou Scaglione, Carl Fenzl and Kevin Zimmerman in the
16s, and Brandon Pierpont, Fred Johnson, Greg Bulleit, Marc Sawyer and Patrick
Gleason in the 14s.

Competition is Friday through Thursday in the Orlando area.

TENNIS IN THE SUNSHINE: The 20th annual Sunshine State Games include
state-sanctioned singles and doubles for juniors and adult men and women. The
competitions will be held July 8-11 at the Hillsborough Community College Tennis
Complex in Tampa.

Juniors will compete in age divisions 10 to 18, while adults will be divided
into six skill-level divisions based on National Tennis Rating Program (NTRP)
guidelines. Cost is $ 10 for juniors in singles and $ 7.50 per person for
doubles; $ 15 for adults in singles and $ 10 for doubles. An SSG T-shirt is
included. For information, call Mike Sophia at (352) 955-2120.

QUALITY TENNIS: The CBS Television Network will feature The Quality Challenge, a
senior men's circuit competition, this weekend on its CBS Sports Spectacular.
Players include John McEnroe, Jimmy Connors, Bjorn Borg and Mats Wilander in an
elimination format tournament at the Rancho Bernardo Inn in San Diego.

The format is similar to golf's Senior PGA Tour event that showcases past
champions playing for prize money. Connors won his third event last year while
McEnroe has reached the final four consecutive years without winning.

80 AND STILL PLAYING: The Top of the World residential development in Clearwater
has among its array of clubs an Eighty-And-Over Tennis Club composed of players
at least 80 years of age. Among those participating are 84-year-olds Jay Miller,
Lee Becerra and Sam Ronsvalle, and 83-year-olds George Church and George
Schmittke. Others in the club who play frequently on the hard courts at the
complex are Dorothy Proteau, Al Malter, John Erickson, Jim Rodgers and Spike
Scharn.

Battistone's racket produces double trouble for his foes

BYLINE: Adrian Dater

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 3B

LENGTH: 504 words


Watching Brian Battistone play tennis is, well, let's just call it unique.

Battistone plays with a two-handled racket that at first glance looks like
garden shears. There has never been another racket like it. When Battistone
serves, he starts with the tennis ball in his right hand, the racket in his
left. Then he tosses the ball high in the air, switches the racket to his right
hand and leaps into the shot -- looking every bit like a volleyball player.

Battistone successfully defended his Colorado State Open men's singles title
Sunday with a 6-2, 6-1 victory over Florida's Greg Oullette at Gates Tennis
Center.

Battistone has been playing with his one-of-a-kind racket for several years now.
Not until he qualified in mixed doubles at the U.S. Open this month did
Battistone and his racket catch the attention of the national media. Even men's
star Rafael Nadal was intrigued by it, peppering him with questions before one
of his matches and trying it out a bit.

"It's a constant topic of conversation, yeah," Battistone said. "I just feel
like it works for my game, and I think it's better on the body. You're not
stressing one side over the other."

The main idea of the racket is to give its user two forehands to make shots,
which theoretically should be stronger.

"I have some ideas of being able to play with either hand -- ambidextrous tennis
-- having the advantage of reach on both sides," Battistone said. "People
laughed at it a lot, but the more matches you win, the more people start to take
it seriously."

Battistone, whose father, Sam, once owned the NBA's Jazz, both in New Orleans
and Utah, helped design the racket with partner Lionel Burt for their joint
business, Natural Tennis. While sales are small, Battistone has many of the
young players he teaches in Las Vegas using them, and says many consider it will
be their lifelong racket.

"Even for me, it's taken me a while to master the racket, because I didn't start
using it until I was in my late 20s," Battistone said. "I guess I've always
thought a bit out of the box."

That goes for his "volleyball" serve too. At 6-foot-3, Battistone feels the
higher he can get for a serve, the better angles he gives himself for
hard-to-handle returns.

Oullette said he tried not to change his own game much against Battistone, but
acknowledged playing him was a new challenge.

"He's definitely got the most unorthodox game I've ever seen," said Oullette,
who played tennis at the University of Florida and is a good friend of former
Gator Tim Tebow.

Battistone and his mixed doubles partner, Nicole Melichar, lost in the first
round at the U.S. Open. Tournaments like the Colorado Open have become more
attractive to players of Battistone's and Oullette's caliber; this year's
overall purse of $25,000 is the highest it has been, with Battistone taking home
$4,000.

In the women's singles final, Alex Poorta of the Netherlands defeated Denver's
Vasilisa Bardina 7-6 (7-5), 3-6, 6-1 to win $1,800.

A Racquet With Precision in Mind

BYLINE: By BARBARA LLOYD

SECTION: Section 1; Page 13; Column 3; Style Desk; Consumer's World Page

LENGTH: 472 words


PRO KENNEX INC. of San Diego has designed an asymmetrical tennis racquet whose
lopsided shape is designed to make it easier to hit a ball precisely.

The opposite sides of the racquet's head frame vary in thickness. Although the
differences are small -- measured in millimeters -- Pro Kennex said that the
racquet, the Asymmetric, makes a big difference in play.

The racquet, which became available in sporting goods stores this spring, is in
the wide-body, thick-frame style that was introduced in 1987 and became popular
among recreational players because of the power it can add to a tennis swing.

But wide-body technology is not without its faults. Racquets made in that style
tend to sacrifice precision for power, while conventional racquets, made with
narrower frames, tend to result in a higher level of accuracy. The Asymmetric is
designed to bridge the gap between the two styles.

"With the same effort, the average player could hit the ball deeper into the
court," Kevin L. Gilbert, the vice president of sales and marketing for Pro
Kennex, said recently about wide-body technology. "But more power was not
necessarily better for more accomplished players. For them, precision is more
important."

Two years ago, Pro Kennex, which is a subsidiary of Kunnan Inc. of Taiwan,
decided to develop a wide-body racquet that better tennis players -- touring and
teaching professionals -- would consider using.

Most professional players shun wide-body racquets, which tend to send a ball off
their strings as if bounced off a trampoline. Top players prefer to use updated
versions of the more traditional narrow racquet, referred to in the industry as
the flat-beam racquet.

Much of the loss in precision and accuracy that occurs with a wide-body racquet
is caused by vibrations in the frame and string area when a ball is hit. Most
top racquet makers claim to have designed some sort of vibration-reduction
system in their wide-body racquets.

The thickness of the Pro Kennex racquet head varies from 22 millimeters on one
side to 30 millimeters on the other. The thick and thin sections are tapered and
alternate along the head in quadrants.

The company said that, when a ball hits the racquet's surface, the quadrants
respond with opposing frequencies that cancel out the resonance in the strings.
The hitting surface is more stable than with other racquets, Mr. Gilbert said.

The Asymmetric is designed with a rounded shaft and is made in one piece, mostly
of graphite.

Mr. Gilbert recommended the Asymmetric for competition-level players. The same
technology is planned for a Pro Kennex racquet designed for intermediate to
advanced players, expected to be available next spring. The suggested retail
price for the Asymmetric is $250. For more information, call (800) 854-1908; in
California, (800) 662-8663.

High-tech racket helps with two-handed tennis

BYLINE: Ben Brown; Josh Young

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 12C

LENGTH: 203 words

DATELINE: MARINA DEL REY, Calif.


If the future of tennis lies in playing with two-handed forehand and backhand,
then the racket of the future has been invented.

The Avatar racket is made with two grips so a player can easily hit the ball
with two hands from the forehand and backhand sides.

''You hold the racket with both hands and then move the forward hand into
backhand grip when preparing to hit the ball,'' says Avatar co-owner Peter
Mackie. ''The racket is completely playable with one hand from both sides until
you learn to use two hands.''

The racket, introduced this week, was designed by California sports scientist
Lionel Burt. Besides giving a player more control, a two-handed game is supposed
to be an antidote for tennis elbow. It also can help older players.

The two-handed trend is represented professionally by Monica Seles, the No.
3-ranked women's player and reigning French Open champion.

The racket has been patented and approved for tournament play by the
International Tennis Federation.

Avatar will have 200 rackets available within four to six weeks at a cost of $
200 a racket, plus tax. Plans for mass production are under way. For more

MAKING IT WORK;
They Also Serve

BYLINE: By MONIQUE P. YAZIGI

SECTION: Section 13;  Page 3;  Column 1;  The City Weekly Desk

LENGTH: 1017 words


EVERY year, for the two weeks either side of Labor Day, the National Tennis
Center in Queens becomes an assault of images -- fans streaming across the
railroad boardwalk, past scalpers of tickets (expensive) and knock-off Open
accessories (cheap); designer-warm-up-suited spectators (or are they players?)
on promenade, past a very upscale peddlers' mall with more designer tennis wear,
racquets, $12-a-pound Italian salad and official Open accessories; and,
especially, the sheer, hypercrowded THIS IS NEW YORK volume of it all. Yet
beneath this crush of ephemera, the Open is really about the basics of the game
-- a ball, a racquet, the score. The people who see that all this runs smoothly
-- that the server will always have a ball, that a favorite racquet will always
be well strung, that everyone will know the score -- work in the realm of the
always seen but rarely contemplated. Now, pay attention.

Think Players Are High-Strung? Check Their Racquets.

PETE SAMPRAS, the world's No. 1-ranked player, walked to the back of the
players' lounge the other day, handed Roger Petersman three Wilson Pro Staff
racquets and walked off.

"VS All Season, 16 gauge, at 72 pounds," recited Mr. Petersman, explaining that
Mr.  Sampras wanted the racquets restrung with Babolat VS All Season natural
gut, average weight, "tight as a board."

Mr. Petersman remembers. "Pete has at least six racquets strung each day he's at
the Open and one freshly strung minutes before he walks onto the court," he
said.

Granted, Mr. Sampras is considered a bit fanatical about his racquets. ("It's
the most important part of my game," he says.) But as head of the racquet
-stringing at the Open, Mr. Petersman (like the 20 other top stringers here) is
expected to know these things.

During the year, the stringers teach tennis and own pro shops. (Mr. Petersman is
the technical product manager for Babolat U.S.A. in Dayton, Ohio.) But they go
to the Open to work nonstop from 7 A.M. to midnight -- stringing, balancing and
regripping more than 250 racquets each day, or 3,500 during the tournament. "I
can't play here, so I might as well be here somehow," said Ian Lev, a stringer
from Weston, Conn.

When a string breaks during a match, the racquet is immediately re-strung. The
stringer personally runs the racquet back onto the court and hands it to the
player.

"Who else could you trust?" asked Tom Parry, another stringer.

Not that the players can't afford it, but none of this service comes cheap --
about $60 a racquet, cash, Visa or MasterCard accepted, no checks, no American
Express.

Where 'Ball Boys' Are Also Girls, Grown-Ups, and Sometimes, Players

A PATCH of blue in a sea of concrete, 280 more-or-less young men and women are
perched high above center court. Having passed rigorous muster for agility,
speed, accuracy and, of course, neatness -- but contrary to popular perception,
not for powerful connections -- they are waiting for their captain, Tina Taps,
to give them their fetching and throwing orders for the first day of play.

In their red-trimmed, navy and white Fila outfits with pure white K-Swiss
sneakers, their job as "ball boys" (actually 25 percent are girls) is to remain
practically invisible on court, while making sure all the tennis balls are
flowing in the right direction.

"I don't watch tennis players anymore; I watch the ball people," said Ms. Taps,
whose job is to monitor, evaluate and insure that everyone follows the rules of
this game.

"They're not allowed to ask for autographs or to take pictures," said Ms. Taps,
35 years old, who during the year works for the United States Tennis
Association.

Which is not to say that they do nothing but stand there and wait for a ball to
chase. Once, Ms. Taps recalled, Ilie Nastase, the famously temperamental
Romanian, asked a ball boy to play out his point in a doubles match. The ball
boy, Gary Spitz, was too dumbfounded to do anything but take the racquet and win
the point, on camera.

Ms. Taps calls them her kids, and most are teen-agers from Queens. But they are
as old as 35, and include a doctor, a lawyer and an accountant. The lawyer is
Mr. Spitz, who is 30 and has been doing this for 15 years now. "I couldn't get a
better seat," said Mr. Spitz, who is now trying out to be an umpire.


They Just Don't Paint It Like They Used To

Danny Rodriguez Musri spends more than 10 hours a day standing on an electric
lift, drawing pencil lines and placing letters and numbers on a big white wall.

That big white wall, looming over the entering crowd, is the main scoreboard.
For the last 10 years, Mr. Musri, 37, a graphic artist from Argentina, has been
charting the entire Open draw, round by round.

Before the Open opens, Mr. Musri spends several days laying out the board,
making sure every measured line is in place. Then he lays down the draw (with
names in black computer-generated letters, or red for seeded players). Three
quarters of an inch separates first-round names, with more space as the draw
winds down, to the commodious two inches of the final round. And for a fortnight
of nights. Mr. Musri records the winners and scores of each match.

Because of the scoreboard's location, just left of the entrance, his work area
also becomes an instant information booth. On the first day of the Open, fans
could be heard asking such well-informed questions as: "Who will be playing in
the final?" and "Is Andre Agassi really with Brooke Shields?"

There are also those who call out, "Last year, they used to paint it." These are
the nostalgists, who probably also wish the tournament were still played on
grass, and they are only mostly wrong.

Until 1984, the board was painted in a fine calligraphic hand by a man named
Jerry Perline, who ran a sign company in Jamaica. Mr. Perline used a French
quill brush dipped into an orange juice can full of red paint. At the Open now,
no one seems to know how to find him. But Mr. Musri has preserved one small bit
of the Perline art: the little brackets linking the two players in each match
are done in red paint, by hand.

Rating the rackets after on-court workouts

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 14C

LENGTH: 278 words



World Tennis reviewers Ed Tiltmann and Rose Marek and USA TODAY reporter Rachel
Shuster tested five racket models. These are subjective opinions based on how
the rackets perform for the types of games these reviewers play. On tennis'
numerical scale (the higher, the better the player) Tiltmann rates 6.0, Marek
4.5 and Shuster 3.0. Do your own testing, too. Many tennis shops will lend
rackets for testing, at a nominal fee. The models tested, and the results:

Gamma's Controlled Power System 95oP+, wide body (mfp. $ 149.95):
- Tiltmann: Not overpowering. Plays very true. Easy on the elbow. An all-around
excellent racket.
- Marek: Lacks a little power but nicely balanced. Pretty light. A little too
light for me. Very good maneuverability at net.
- Shuster: Very firm. Good power, but some vibration when ball not hit squarely.
Good for volleying.

Wilson Profile 3.6si, wide body (mfp. $ 226):
- Tiltmann: ''Plenty of power. A little stiff. Will be tough on the arms of some
people.  Tough to get around at net. Ball can fly on you if you don't stay on
top. But it's a real weapon.''
- Marek: ''Extremely stiff. If you can control it, it's a great racket. Power to
spare.
- Shuster: ''Tough to maneuver. Feels too head-heavy. Powerful, but can hurt the
elbow.''

Donnay Formula Pro, conventional midsize (mfp. $ 220):
- Tiltmann: One of my favorites. Good power and control. Beautiful grip. Doesn't
slip out of your hand. Plays well for an all-around game.

- Marek: Doesn't overpower, but power certainly adequate on ground strokes.
Crisp volleys. Call it a 'user-friendly' racket. Very versatile.
- Shuster: Good balance. Crisp at net. Good for all-around game. The right feel.

Weed Saver, super oversize (mfp. $ 225): - Tiltmann: Good racket for somebody
with great racket control. Ball will fly off the big surface and give a
trampoline effect if technique is poor. An artist's racket.
- Marek: Certainly adequate power from the baseline and maneuverable for a large
frame. Great for doubles because volleys won't get past.
- Shuster: Unsettling because the head is so big. But will do wonders for net
play.

Yamaha Secret 10-II, wide body: (mfp. $ 179)
- Tiltmann: Excellent balance. Plays true. Very smooth. Not too much vibration.
Plenty of power. Good for all-around tennis.
- Marek: A little heavy in the head. Firm, but flexible. Good depth on ground
strokes. Crisp volleys. Pretty stable.
- Shuster: Stable, but lacking power. Good balance and feel. Helps you feel home
at net.

Advantage, Dunlop;
How Oversize Racquets Restored Company's Game

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

SECTION: Section 1; Page 39; Column 2; Business/Financial Desk

LENGTH: 1613 words


Almost as soon as he accepted a job as president of Dunlop Sports, David A.
Haggerty got a call from two old friends at Sports Authority, the national
mega-outlet for sporting goods. "They said, 'Hi, welcome aboard; just want to
tell you we can't carry Dunlop tennis racquets anymore; the brand just doesn't
sell,' " Mr. Haggerty recalled.

Mr. Haggerty flew to Sports Authority's headquarters in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.,
and talked them into keeping at least a few Dunlop racquets. But it was a
sobering experience.

"Apparently, Dunlop had become this your-father's-Oldsmobile type of company,"
Mr. Haggerty said. "Our product stacked up fine, but we had a real image
problem."

That was almost three years ago, and, to cadge from yet another consumer
products ad, Dunlop has come a long way, baby. Tennis players are snapping up
superlong racquets, which Dunlop was the first to sell in 1995. Professional
tennis players like the hard-serving Mark Philippoussis are endorsing Dunlop's
products. And joint marketing deals with companies like Reebok, Thor-Lo and
Perrier are putting Dunlop in well-regarded company.

Dunlop's recovery in tennis gear has been much faster than the sport's slow
return to popularity. As such, it is both a case study for any company that is
tempted to blame external forces for its problems and a primer on how to stretch
a lean marketing budget far enough to restore the gloss to a dimming brand.

Dunlop's numbers reflect its resurgence. In 1994, when Mr. Haggerty signed on,
Dunlop lost about $2 million on $12.4 million in tennis-related sales in the
United States. (Golf equipment, which the company sells under the Maxfli and
Dunlop brands, is a $75 million business that has held its own.) Last year,
Dunlop earned about $5 million on $25.2 million in tennis equipment sales, and
Mr. Haggerty has promised his British bosses -- Dunlop Slazenger International
Ltd., a private company, owns Dunlop Sports, which is based in Greenville, S.C.
-- to double sales and profits again by the turn of the century.

Those sales are coming out of competitors' hides. Two years ago, industry
executives say, Dunlop accounted for barely 6 percent of the sales of racquets
and balls. Last year, it commanded 12 percent of the $200 million wholesale
market, and more than 21 percent of the market for extra-long racquets, those an
inch or two longer than standard 27-inch racquets and that are said to provide a
powerful serve.

Long racquets sell at the high end of the spectrum, which runs from as low as
$20 for a child's racquet to $300 for some highly engineered, weight-balanced
models. (Dunlop's prices top out at $200.)

Dunlop is unlikely to unseat Prince or Wilson Sporting Goods, which together
control about 75 percent of the market. But it is breathing down Head's neck for
third place, and it is keeping Yonex, Spalding and other rivals at bay.

"Dunlop is back as a recognizable player," said Philip Perrella, co-owner of
Total Tennis, a specialty shop in Sarasota, Fla.

Dunlop's problems, of course, are far from over. Its brand still lacks pizazz.
Until recently, John McEnroe, who left the tennis circuit five years ago, was
the only professional endorsing Dunlop racquets. ("Which was great," Mr.
Haggerty quipped, "if we wanted to be the official racquet of retired tennis
players.") Its long racquet is already widely copied, and Dunlop has no other
major products in the pipeline.

Some stores already report dwindling Dunlop sales. "Dunlop's sales are again
starting to recede, so they'd better continue innovating," Mr. Perrella warned.

Mr. Haggerty knows that Dunlop's window of opportunity may be small.  A tennis
pro turned businessman, he joined Prince in 1980 when it was a distant third to
Wilson and Head. By the time he left in 1993, he was a senior vice president who
had helped Prince ride what he calls its "better mousetrap," the oversize
racquet, to the market leader's spot.

Wilson's new extra-light and wide-bodied racquets toppled Prince a few years
later. And now Wilson, which is owned by the Finnish company Amer, may do the
same to Dunlop's long racquet. Its new Sledgehammer Outerlimits, a 29-inch
racquet with a 135-square-inch head, is the biggest racquet permitted by
International Tennis Federation guidelines.

"In tennis, the product is the driving force, and even a great brand name will
carry you just so far," Jim Baugh, president of Chicago-based Wilson, said.

Indeed, ever since the late 1970's, when new graphite composites made possible
racquets with a range of attributes that wood never allowed, racquet makers have
tinkered with shapes, weights and designs that provide more power or accuracy.
Since modern tennis racquets rarely give out, they realized that the only way to
get players to buy new ones was to persuade them that the new racquets would
improve their play.

That, of course, is part science and part salesmanship. So although Dunlop is
spending about $1 million a year to develop racquet technology, Mr. Haggerty is
concentrating even harder on buffing up Dunlop's image.

He has tripled the annual advertising budget for tennis equipment to $650,000
and will spend about $3 million this year on free equipment and promotional
materials for teaching pros, who he hopes will talk up Dunlop products. Dunlop
now has some 800 pros promoting its racquets and balls at clubs and specialty
shops, and Mr. Haggerty has set his sights on 1,000 -- not many compared with
the 5,600 in Wilson's stable, but quite an improvement over the meager 200
promoting Dunlop in 1994.

"If I get our story to the trade, they'll carry it to the customer," Mr.
Haggerty, 39, said during a tennis-plus-conversation afternoon in his hometown
of Princeton, N.J. (And yes, he has one heck of a serve.)

Now Mr. Haggerty needs to make sure customers do not look blankly -- or worse,
snort with derision -- when that tale is told. Dunlop's internet home page
(www.dunlopsports.com) is rife with jazzy graphics and hip informality. And the
company has signed up Wayne Ferreira, the world's 10th-ranked male tennis
player, and Mr. Philippoussis, whose 137 mile-an-hour serve is the fastest on
record, as Dunlop endorsers.

"If pros are playing with a Dunlop racquet, you'll feel better playing with
one," Mr. Haggerty said.

For similar reasons, Dunlop is piggybacking its image onto more prestigious
names. It is chipping in with Perrier to put spring water-and-tennis-ball
vending machines into tennis clubs, and Mr. Haggerty is talking to BMW about a
joint promotion aimed at women, the details of which are still being ironed out.

Reebok International and Thor-Lo, whose sales representatives generally
concentrate on mass retail outlets, have given Dunlop's sales force the
exclusive right to sell their respective shoes and socks to tennis specialty
stores. "It's an old cliche, but together we are stronger than any one of us
alone," said James L. Throneburg, Thor-Lo's chairman.

The three companies do not tread on one another's product toes -- something that
neither Prince nor Wilson, which make shoes and apparel, can say. "Joint sales
forces only make sense when there are no overlapping products," said Phil
Parrish, who manages Reebok's sales of tennis and running shoes.

Mr. Haggerty may have good timing as well as good partners. Tennis is nowhere
near its peak of 35 million American players in 1978, but, thanks partly to
racquets that make it easy for even aging baby boomers to play powerful tennis,
it is coming back from its nadir of 13.5 million players in 1985. "Tennis is
finally regaining its popularity," said Brad Patterson, the Tennis Industry
Association's president, who estimates that some 19.5 million people hit the
courts last year.

Moreover, sales of cheap racquets -- those under $50 -- are rising, which
historically has indicated that more children and first-time players are taking
up the sport.

And while Wilson remains a formidable competitor, Prince has been foundering
since the Italian clothing company Benetton Group bought it in 1990. Benetton
spent lavishly on ads and such promotions as sponsoring a Formula One racing
car. But it cut Prince's sales force by a third and pulled back on research.

In the absence of new Prince racquets or visits from Prince salespeople, many
tennis shops gave Prince's "peg" space -- the wall space on which racquets are
displayed -- to Wilson and Dunlop. Tennis industry executives say Prince has in
the last few years gone from about 45 percent of the market to 30 percent --
effectively changing places with Wilson, until 1994 a distant No. 2.

Even before his days at Prince, Mr. Haggerty has always kept one foot planted in
the game, the other in the business. He went to George Washington University on
a tennis scholarship, majored in marketing -- and made extra money stringing
racquets for his teammates. After graduating in 1979 he played professional
tennis in Europe -- and, as he bluntly put it, recognized he was not good enough
to make a living on the pro circuit. "I had talent, but others had a lot more
talent," he said.

So he returned to the United States to teach tennis at a club in Hamilton, N.J.
One morning, one of his students, a Prince executive, suggested he apply for a
job. "I didn't want to be presumptuous, so I waited until after lunch to call,"
Mr. Haggerty recalled.

He has no illusions about toppling Wilson, or even overtaking Prince. He knows
that his challenges are more fundamental.

"People who care what others think still are embarrassed to walk onto a court
with a Dunlop racquet," he said. "If they get over that, most of our battle will
be won."

Chart: "A Return to Form"
In the late 1970's and early 1980's, Dunlop Sports was among the top makers of
tennis equipement, with high profile players endorsing its products. Gradually,
though, the company's standing slipped as Dunlop failed to keep up with
innovations by competitors. Now Dunlop is fighting back, led by its first
signficant innovation in years; a longer, oversized racquet called the Max
Superlong. (Naum Kazdan/The New York Times)

1980
Market share rank: 3
Tennis equipement sales: $23.2 million
Through the 1970's, most Dunlop racquets were made of wood. They were endorsed
by John McEnroe. In 1980, Dunlop introduced its Max line of graphite racquets.
But Prince's oversize racquets, introduced in 1976, made it the No. 1 seller.

1991
Market share rank: Unavailable
Sales: $19.5 million
Dunlop introduced a racquet that reduced vibration but did not improve players'
games. Wilson's wide-body racquet, introduced in 1988, quickly became the
industry standard. Steffi Graf was now Dunlop's best known endorser.

1996
Market share rank: 3
Sales: $25.2 million
From its nadir in 1994, when sales of $12.4 million ranked it fifth, Dunlop rode
its new longer, oversized racquets to a revival. After losing Ms. Graf to
Wilson, the company signed rising stars Mark Philippoussis, and Wayne Ferreira
as endorsers. (pg. 39)

Time to Get Into A New Racket

From news services and staff reports

SECTION: SPORTS; PAGE E2; FANFARE

LENGTH: 302 words


An Ohio mathematician has invented a tennis racket with a rotating handle that
he says can transform hapless hackers into sure-fire smashers with the turn of a
screw.

The "index handle" racket has a six-sided grip instead of the traditional eight.
It also lets players adjust the angle of the racket face to conform to their
anatomy.

Inventor Andy Brown, an actuarial consultant in Cincinnati and a recreational
tennis player, blames a tilted racket face for many of the frustrations of
beginning players.

"One guy grabs a racket and has the face straight up and down," Brown said.
"Another guy grabs it and has the face facing up 40 degrees. The guy with the
handle facing up 40 degrees isn't going to get the ball in the court."

Brown's racket allows a player to adjust the angle over 60 degrees at any of 10
settings simply by loosening a screw in the bottom of the handle. Any player,
Brown says, will thus swing with a level racket head.

Brown started developing the racket 10 years ago in an effort to improve his
mediocre game. He says the racket turned him into an A-level player.

Joseph Hamill, a University of Massachusetts researcher, says the six-sided
handle fits the hand better and puts the wrist in a stronger position. He says
it also seems to reduce vibration that contributes to tennis elbow.

"The hot new field today is ergonomics," he said. "Basically, what this racket
does is give you an ergonomic advantage."

Hamill, a professor of biomechanics at the Amherst campus, found the index
handle improved the accuracy of forehand shots by an average of 14 percent and
backhands by 9 percent.

Howard Brody, a University of Pennsylvania physicist who reviews new rackets for
the U.S. Tennis Association, said he believes the index handle would fall within
official rules.

TENNIS;
Today's Longer Racquets Are Making a Lot of Noise

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR

SECTION: Section B;  Page 13;  Column 1;  Sports Desk

LENGTH: 674 words


At 5 feet 8 inches, Michael Chang is one of the shortest players in men's
tennis. Except for stretching himself on a rack, adding an extra inch to improve
his game was impossible until Prince supplied him with a 28-inch prototype
racquet.

At one inch longer than the standard, the Prince racquet has helped Chang's
serve, reach, power and net coverage. It hasn't hurt his standing, either: Since
1993, his ATP computer ranking has risen from eighth to fifth.

"It gives me better trajectory on my serve, adding five to seven miles per
hour," he said this week while preparing for next week's United States Open. "It
gives me more of a margin of error on my serve and a better percentage on my
first serves. I've had more aces than ever before."

For Chang's work in tweaking the prototype into reality, Prince named one of its
three new long-body racquets after him: the $250 Precision Graphite Michael
Chang.

Prince, Dunlop, Wilson, Weed and Spalding are among the manufacturers rushing
into the underachieving racquet market with 28-inch, 28 1/4-inch, 28 1/2-inch
and 29-inch long bodies. Some view their elongated racquets as possessing the
sales potential of past breakthroughs such as wide bodies and oversized heads.

They hope the longer racquets will revive sales, which have fallen from 4.1
million sold for $330.4 million in 1991 to 3 million sold for $180.1 million in
1994, according to the National Sporting Goods Association.

In all, nine racquet makers will roll out 15 long-bodies by February.

Dunlop Slazenger was the first in the market in May with its Max Predator and
Max Enforcer; a third is coming in October. The two new racquets have accounted
for a 30 percent increase in racquet sales for Dunlop. "Nothing else out there
will put new racquets in the hands of people who already have perfectly good
racquets," said Rob Bauder, Dunlop's marketing director.

Mark Mason, owner of the Mason Tennis Mart in Manhattan, said: "This brings
hope; it's the first time there's been this much interest in a product in
years."

However, some time is needed to adapt one's distance from the ball.

"It was hard to adjust to on ground strokes; the extra length was a little
unwieldy," said David Sparrow, managing editor of Sporting Goods Dealer, a trade
magazine. "But it was a real weapon on the serve and at the net."

Prince, with three long-bodies just being shipped, is so certain that the new
models represent its future that it plans to introduce no new racquet this year
or next that measures less than 28 inches. "We're sold out through most of the
fall," said Rick Margin, Prince's vice president of marketing.

What took so long for racquet makers to embrace length? Longer racquets have
been around before -- the now-forgotten MatchMate made one in the early 1980's
-- but without lighter modern materials, they were often unmanageable.

And with manufacturers more focused on expanding the face of the racquet with
the oversized technology, and then increasing power and enlarging the sweet spot
with wide-bodied racquets, length wasn't emphasized -- until recently.

The current crop of long-bodies still measures below the International Tennis
Federation maximum of 32 inches and provides more length with little or no extra
weight. At 9.4 ounces, for example, Wilson's wide-body Sledge Hammer Stretch
weighs only 0.2 ounces more than the Sledge Hammer.

Unlike Prince, Wilson isn't pinning a huge part of its future on longer
racquets. "It's an option," said Heather Kinsella, a Wilson spokeswoman.

The manufacturers are targeting their products mostly to the recreational
market, which craves forgiving, powerful racquets that compensate for a variety
of sins. "If I'm 50, and my foot speed isn't what it used to be," said Prince's
Margin, "this is a fountain of youth opportunity."

In the end, however, the player is more important than the racquet.

Chang said: "Prince may not want to hear this, but the racquet hasn't made all
the difference. I was a top player before this. But it has helped."

He buys a racquet that feels good and hopes it will make him another  Tilden on
the court even if he hasn't any idea how it works.

But Howard Brody, a University of Pennsylvania physicist, has
 discovered that such strange things as percussion centres, vibration
 nodes, oscillation periods, dwell times, assymetric deflections and
 restitution coefficients play an important role in producing an ace, a
 passing shot or a slashing volley.

As a physicist, he has learned things about tennis racquet dynamics
 that might help players to better understand why a ball sometimes does
 things the racquet-holder never intended.

Dr. Brody, in the June issue of the American Journal of Physics, gives
 an esoteric scientific explanation of the physics of the tennis racquet
 and how one's best-planned stroke may go awry.

Dr. Brody, a 47-year-old, once-a-month tennis player, became
 interested in the physics of tennis racquets several years ago when the
 large-size Prince racquet appeared in stores. Finding no information in
 published physics or tennis literature, he used laser beams, mirrors,
 oscilloscopes and other scientific paraphernalia in a Princeton
 University laboratory to conduct his experiments.

Employing several different brands of racquets and suspending them
 from the ceiling by string, putting them in vises and laying them flat,
 he was able to determine many physical characteristics of the racquets.

The centre of percussion, a vital factor in racquet performance,
 varied from racquet to racquet. The percussion centre is that spot on the
 racquet where, if an object is hit, there will be no vibration or torque
 - areas called vibration nodes - that would tend to twist the racquet in
 the player's hand. The ideal percussion centre would be in the centre of
 the racquet head, but Dr. Brody found it was usually an inch or closer to
 the handle. In larger racquet heads the percussion centre tends to be
 nearer to the head's actual centre.

The percussion centre is often called the sweet spot, Dr. Brody said
 in an interview. But that's jargon and nobody knows what it really
 means.

In centre hits at right angles to the racquet, the ball rebounds in a
 precise 180-degree line. But in his tests the researcher also noted that
 in off-centre hits, the asymmetrical string deflection caused the ball to
 rebound at an angle. And the harder the off-centre ball is hit, the
 farther askew it can go, further compounding the many problems a tennis
 player faces.

Dr. Brody, who specializes in high-energy particle physics, dropped
 hundreds of tennis balls on racquets or brick floors to determine the
 role the ball plays when it hits the racquet. A tennis ball is a lousy
 thing, he said. When it hits the floor it bounces only half way back up.
 A racquet is much more efficient. When its strings are stretched by the
 ball, it doesn't lose much energy.

The distance of the ball's rebound is determined by its coefficient of
 restitution. This is the ratio of velocity after the collision to the
 velocity before the collision, and I found that the tennnis ball loses
 about half its kinetic energy in the collision. As a result, the ball
 loses up to half of the speed it had before it struck the racquet, he
 added.

But other factors further complicate the seemingly simple act of
 hitting a ball with something that looks like a giant flyswatter.

The dwell time - the time the ball stays in contact with the racquet
 strings - combined with the time it takes the racquet head to bend back
 when hit by the ball and then return to its normal spot, known to
 physicists as the oscillation period, are prime factors in determining
 how fast the ball comes off the racquet.

Dr. Brody, using a laser beam, measured the dwell time and found it
 averaged about five milliseconds. But, using a laser beam and a light
 detector, he found the oscillation cycle of the racquet lasted much
 longer. Therefore, the ball rebounded off the racquet before getting any
 impetus from the frame's return to its normal position.

So I reasoned that if the dwell time matched the racquet's
 oscillation, you could get more power into your shot. And to do this,
 stiffer racquets would be the answer. Such racquets would have shorter
 oscillation times.

And to get better synchronization between the racquet's oscillation
 and the ball's coefficient of restitution, Dr. Brody found, required a
 racquet not strung as tightly as that on most racquets used by good
 players. Most of these are strung at tensions ranging from 45 to 60
 pounds.

Two years ago Dr. Brody, who had never bothered to make a racquet
 based on his research, discovered another scientist, Dr. Enoch Durbin, a
 55-year-old professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at
 Princeton University and a tennis buff, had been studying the physical
 properties of tennis racquets in his basement and had designed a new type
 of racquet.

Dr. Brody called Dr. Durbin and the latter has mailed one of his
 racquets to the Pennsylvania University scientist. Dr. Brody plans to
 invite Dr. Durbin to Philadelphia to join in testing the racquet. After
 that we'll go on the court and play a match, with Dr. Durbin using his
 new racquet, Dr. Brody said.

ST. LOUIS TEAMS SURVIVE ROAD TEST IN VOLVO TOURNEY

BYLINE: Ron Cobb

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 7D

LENGTH: 974 words


St. Louis enjoyed one of its finest Volvo League moments ever last weekend at
the sectionals in Springfield, Mo., when three of its teams qualified for the
nationals this fall.  St. Louis does not have a history of doing well at the
sectionals against teams from Iowa, Nebraska, Oklahoma and Kansas City
(officially the Heart of America district). Last year not one team from here
went on to the nationals.  So it was especially noteworthy when the 5.0-level
men from Creve Coeur Racquet Club, the 4.5 men from Kettle River Racquet Club
and the 3.0 men from Town & Country Racquet Club emerged as the winners in their
respective divisions.  Their triumphs reflected not only their abilities as
tennis players but also their willingness to persevere through several maddening
rain delays.  Creve Coeur's first match, scheduled for noon Saturday, didn't
begin until 8:30 p.m. Its next match began at 11:45 and concluded at 2 a.m.
Kettle River also played two matches Saturday, beginning at 9 p.m. and ending at
2:30 a.m.. It then was required to be back on the courts at 10 a.m. Sunday.
Captain Bill Hornbarger's Creve Coeur men will be in the nationals Oct.  11-14
in San Antonio, Texas. They were 3-0 in Springfield, beating Nebraska 2-1,
Kansas City 3-0 and Iowa 3-0. Hornbarger was joined by tDavid Apted, David
Gresham, Spencer Burke, Andy Thome, Steve Brandt and Robert Balboa, although
Balboa was injured and couldn't play. Traditionally strong Oklahoma failed to
send a team to Springfield, so Hornbarger had figured the Nebraska match would
be the key. Because of injuries, Nebraska sent only one doubles team and a
singles player, thereby defaulting one of the two doubles matches.  Kettle
River's championship was achieved with the most drama. Captain Rob Simpson's
team started with 4-1 victories over Oklahoma and Nebraska and then faced Kansas
City in the match ending at 2:30 a.m. With the matches even at 2-2, the outcome
hinged on Kettle River's No. 3 doubles team of Odie Cowan and Dave Hoffman. They
fell behind 4-1 in the third set before rallying to win 7-5.  ''It was 2:30 in
the morning and we were going crazy,'' Simpson said.  Kettle River will go to
the nationals Oct. 11-14 in Tucson, Ariz. Its lineup also consisted of Brock
Borman, Ali Majedi, Bob Meyers, Ken Holbert, Jim Ford, Brent Wohlford and Gary
Sova.  The 3.0 men from Town & Country go to Tucson on Oct. 25-28. Under captain
Bill Nickles, they breezed through their only two matches, 5-0 over Oklahoma and
4-1 over Nebraska. Other team members are Hal Harris, Roy Taylor, Bill Kirchner,
Anthony Ford, Tom Michaud, Mike Williams, Don Lauer and Dennis Lauer.  Among the
10 St. Louis teams that went to Springfield, three others finished second: the
4.5 women from Castle Oak, the 4.0 women from Castle Oak and the 2.5 women from
Woodsmill.  The first verification clinic for the Volvo League season is
scheduled for 6:30-8:30 p.m. Aug. 23 at Woodsmill Racquet Club. . . . A free
Beginner's World Tennis tournament for juniors age 7-17 is set for 8 a.m. to 2
p.m. Saturday at Heman Park. To register, call Mark Platt at 391-9898. . . .
Dave Luesse will give a demonstration of wheelchair tennis at 11 a.m. Saturday
at Concord Sports Clubs.  Results from last weekend's Granite City Open: P.K.
Pierson beat Roger Follmer 6-3, 6-0 in the singles final; Rob Lombardi and Mike
Bryant beat Mike Kovar and Brad Compton 7-5, 6-2 in the doubles final; Bob
Finder was the men's 35s winner; and Larry Iftner and Mike Patrick won the men's
35 doubles.  Junior winners were Roger Follmer in boys 18s, Brent Davidson in
boys 16s, Jason Salinardi in boys 14s, Joseph Martel in boys 12s and Brent
Davidson and Kenny Winter in boys 16 doubles.

Local mixed doubles teams start their season

BYLINE: NANCY MORGAN

SECTION: NEIGHBORHOOD TIMES; TENNIS; Pg. 22

LENGTH: 912 words



USA Tennis Florida local mixed doubles leagues opened Sunday.

Eight teams are in the adult division and nine in the senior for players at
least 50 years old.

Participating in both divisions are the Racquet Club of St. Petersburg, Bardmoor
Golf and Tennis Club, the Phil Green Tennis Academy at Safety Harbor Spa and
Royal Racquet Club.

Competing in the adult division only are East Lake Woodlands and McMullen Tennis
Complex in Clearwater. Senior-only teams are from the St. Petersburg Tennis
Center, Westin Innisbrook Resort and Treasure Island Tennis and Yacht Club.

Bardmoor has the most squads with 5, followed by Phil Green Academy, 3, and the
Racquet Club, 2.

"We do have a few more teams than last year," said Erika Boardman, a coordinator
in the 5-year-old league. "We tried a few different things this year to try to
attract more teams.

"We changed the format so that a third-set tie-breaker is played rather than a
full third set," she said. "Plus, we're playing both the adult and senior
matches on Sundays rather than on two different days."

Boardman, along with fellow coordinators Liz Dunlop and Bob Hagerman, hoped the
changes would draw more teams and make it more feasible for a player to compete
in both divisions.

Sunday, the Racquet Club's 7.5 senior mixed squad won its first match, 3-0 over
St. Petersburg Tennis Center.

Playing for the Racquet Club were Rosemary and Steve Uebel in No. 1, Bette and
Tony Damouny No. 2 and Suzanne Earle and Jack Weldon No. 3. Carolyn and Nick
Pavonetti and Carol and Ed Swanick round out the Racquet Club team.

"I think the mixed is really fun," said Marshall Craig, Racquet Club's captain.
"I only wish we could get more teams to turn out. This league is definitely more
relaxed than the men's doubles."

This Sunday, the Racquet Club plays host to Royal Racquet Club, a 2-1 winner
over Phil Green Academy last weekend.

In the 8.5 senior mixed, Treasure Island fell 3-0 to Phil Green Academy and has
a bye this week. Bardmoor entertains Phil Green Academy.

The Racquet Club's 8.5 adult team also fell 3-0 to McMullen and will face
Bardmoor on Sunday.

Last year's adult division winners were Bardmoor (7.5) and the Racquet Club
(8.5). Senior champions were Innisbrook (6.5), Bardmoor (7.5) and Phil Green
Academy (8.5).

Mixed doubles matches begin at noon for the adult division and at 3 p.m. for the
senior. Additional teams will be accepted through Jan. 31 by contacting Boardman
(399-2459), Dunlop (391-0811) or Hagerman (391-4380).

SOUTH PINELLAS LADIES:  St. Petersburg Tennis Center is the doubles league
3.0-3.5 division champion.

Scoring 13 points in the five-team division, SPTC finished ahead of the Vinoy B
squad. Playing for SPTC were captain Joan Malone, Bridget Misner, Nobedine
Tucker and Sarah Booth.

In the 3.5-4.0 division, Shipwatch Tennis Club and Feather Sound are deadlocked
with 14 points, as are Treasure Island Rec and the SPCC Aces with 11.

Today in the final match of the division playoff, Shipwatch and Feather Sound
face off, as do TI Rec and SPCC.

SENIOR LEAGUE: The Racquet Club of St. Petersburg's 3.5 Central team earned its
second consecutive 3-0 victory in USA Tennis Florida's local Senior Men's
Doubles League action last week.

Playing for the Racquet Club in its Bardmoor match were Ray Cianci and Tony
Damouny (No. 1), Bob Steele and Don Campagna (No. 2) and Marshall Craig and
David Laesser (No. 3).

Saturday, the Racquet Club plays host to McMullen.

In the 3.5 South competition, a second Racquet Club team fell 2-1 to Treasure
Island Tennis and Yacht Club 2-1.

Scoring TI's points were Ralph Capasso and Stephen Newman in No. 1 and Richard
Prestera and Gordon Coyle (No. 2). Nick Pavonetti and Robert Spiegel scored the
Racquet Club's only point in the No. 3 spot. All three matches were
three-setters.

Seminole Lake Tennis Center's 4.0 South squad beat the Vinoy 2-1 on the play of
Larry Daum and John Beda in No. 2 and Bill Simmers and Tim Kahle (No. 3). Dave
Krebs and Nga Duong scored the Vinoy's only point.

JUNIOR PLAY: Alex Gillott prevented Nicholas Berning from spoiling his boys
16-and-under singles victory in the Pre-Holiday Classic at Seminole Lake Tennis
Center.

Gillott rallied from a first-set loss in the title match to defeat Berning 4-6,
6-0, 6-2.

Kira Kucin of Belleair won the girls 10 consolation.

NATIONAL OPEN: In the USTA National Open Championships in Pensacola last month,
second-seeded Kelly Nelson rebounded from a first-match loss in the girls 18
main draw to win six rounds and advance to the consolation final with Danielle
Wiggins of Jacksonville. Nelson won 3-6, 6-3, 10-8.

Nelson and Linda Yang of Coconut Creek reached the doubles final before falling
8-4 to Emily Applegate and Helene Stephens of South Carolina.

CHEVAL CLASSIC: Top-seeded Jeff Chambers, Florida's No. 1 player in the
35-and-over division, marched past the competition to face Clearwater's Kurt
Long in the Winter Classic at Cheval Country Club in Lutz. Chambers won 6-1,
6-0.

BRING A FRIEND: Group tickets are available for the Dec. 14 exhibition match
between Sports Illustrated Sportswoman of the Year Jennifer Capriati and Anna
Kournikova. The 7:30 p.m. event will be at the Ice Palace in Tampa. For
information, call (813) 301-6714.

COMING UP: Countryside Country Club in Clearwater will have the Countryside
Junior Classic - singles with consolation rounds - Saturday-Monday. Call John
Schneider, (727) 796-1136.

USA Adult League playoffs to begin

BYLINE: NANCY MORGAN

SECTION: LARGO TIMES; TENNIS; Pg. 4

LENGTH: 984 words



The countdown to the state tournament begins Saturday for top area teams in the
USA Adult Tennis League.

A three-week series of playoff matches have been scheduled by coordinators Carol
Levin for the women and Peter Laker for the men to determine which local teams
advance to regional, state and, hopefully, national tournaments.

"Round-robin formats are planned for the 3.0, 3.5 and 4.0 divisions," said Levin
of the women's schedule. "I expect the playoffs to be quite competitive. Feather
Sound was undefeated in the 3.0 while the Vinoy lost just one match, just like
East Lake and Treasure Island in the 4.0."

Another East Lake team in the 3.5 tied with the Vinoy in overall results (8-1)
and match points (33). To determine the division's top seed, fewest games lost
were counted and East Lake took the top spot.

Saturday morning playoff matches include East Lake at Feather Sound and McMullen
at the Vinoy in the 3.0; East Lake hosting Feather Sound and Innisbrook at the
Vinoy in the 3.5; Bardmoor at East Lake and the Racquet Club at Treasure Island
in the 4.0.

The women's 4.5 division is still in progress and the Safety Harbor Spa was
unchallenged in the 5.0.

Laker expects the men's playoffs to be very competitive as well.

"It was nice to see that in almost all cases, playoff teams were not determined
until very nearly the end of the regular season," said Laker. "That makes me
expect to see some very hard-fought matches in these next three weeks."

Among the four teams in the 3.5 playoff (Countryside, Racquet Club, Bardmoor and
Royal Racquet Club) only two matches were lost during the regular season.
Saturday, Bardmoor is at the Racquet Club at noon and Countryside faces Royal at
1 p.m.

Joining Countryside and the Racquet Club, each with a 9-1 record, are wild-card
teams East Lake and Bardmoor in the 4.0. Countryside hosts Bardmoor at 12:15
p.m. Saturday and East Lake is at the Racquet Club at 2 p.m.

The Racquet Club lost just one match in the 4.5 division and joins wild-card
teams Safety Harbor, Royal Racquet and McMullen in a round-robin playoff. Safety
Harbor hosts Royal at noon Saturday and McMullen is at the Racquet Club at 2
p.m.

Feather Sound captured the men's 3.0 title with a 10-0 record among six teams
and the Treasure Island Recreation Center won the men's 5.0.

Playoffs continue on Saturdays through June 19, with the winners advancing to
the July 23-25 regional tournament at Longboat Key.

GREY WINS IN ATLANTA: Top-seeded Lori Grey won five matches and captured the
girls 18-and-under Peach State Junior Tennis Classic title in Peachtree City,
Ga., last weekend. Grey, a senior at Seminole High and the Times Player of the
Year, defeated sixth seed Anne Smith of Marietta in three sets in the final of
the national tournament.

No. 3 seed George Navas won four matches and reached the boys 12 final before
falling 6-1, 6-3 to No. 1 seed Matt Bruch of Illinois. Kyle Nelson won two
rounds in the 32-player boys 18 draw.

SENIORS AT SECTIONALS: Seven senior teams of players at least 50 years old, and
five super senior teams of players at least 60 came up short in last month's
state championships. The senior women's 4.5 team based at Royal Racquet Club
came the closest to a title but lost a tiebreaker to Naples.

After three days of competition, Royal, Ocala and Naples were tied with
identical records. Tournament officials counted fewest sets lost during the
competition to determine the winner, but Naples and Royal again tied with eight
sets lost. Finally, officials counted fewest games lost and determined Naples
had lost 74 compared to Royal's 79. Naples was declared the state champion.

Ironically, in an earlier match, Royal defeated Naples 2-1, according to Royal
captain Ria Graham.

JUNIOR MEMORIES: Local juniors netted five of 10 singles championships in last
month's Memories in Clearwater state-sanctioned tournament at the McMullen
Tennis Complex. Winning were Rachel Silverberg (14s), Morgan Frank (10s),
Aleksey Bubis (18s), Dane Vernon (16s) and Luke Bodine (10s).

This weekend, juniors can test their skills again in the Junior Clay Court
Championships at the Tampa Palms Tennis and Athletic Club. Call Jonathan Clark
at 813) 632-1676. Also, the Stearns State Warm-Ups begin Friday in Sarasota.
Call Stearns at (941) 351-5797.

CHARITY AT EAST LAKE: More than 160 players on 111 doubles teams competed in the
ninth annual Charity Tournament for Morton Plant Mease Hospital. Hosted and
organized by members of East Lake Woodlands Country Club last weekend, proceeds
benefited the hospital's cancer research at the Powell Pavilion.

The open division doubles winners were Angie Dunham and Page Buck in mixed,
Stephen White and Nigel Mitten in men's, and Diane Ostrander and Paula Castora
in women's. In 3.5-minus competition, Amy Radel won the mixed with her father
Bob and teamed with Michelle Westhoefer to win the women's.

Other winners included Laura Midden and Tom Frank (3.5) and Ostrander and Dean
Bryan (4.0) in mixed; Janet Loomis and Lisa Flamand (3.5) and Midori Nakayama
and Yuka Tanaka (4.0) in women's; Red McGarry and Bob Knoth (3.5), Jeff McQuinn
and Gene Ulishney (4.0), and Don Kirby and Ken Cherven (4.5) in men's.

K-SWISS RESULTS: Nine women's, 10 men's, five juniors' and three adult doubles
teams completed competition in the spring session of the K-Swiss Tennis League.

INSIDE LOCAL TENNIS;
Racket-makers going to greater lengths to please customers

BYLINE: Todd Holcomb; STAFF WRITER

LENGTH: 565 words



The Super Show's forecast for the year in tennis is long on rackets.

Manufacturers introduced more than 25 models that exceed the standard 27 inch es
at Super Show '96, with Wilson, Prince and Dunlop predicting longer rackets will
be their leading sellers this year.

"Long-bodies are unquestionably the (tennis) story of the Super Show," said
Steve Riley, national vice president of sales for Prince. "It's probably the
most important development in tennis in 20 years."

Michael Chang, playing with a 28-inch version of the Prince Graphite Original,
has showcased extra-longs by reaching the top five in the world in the two years
he's played with one. At just 5-foot-8, Chang is suddently fourth on the tour in
aces. His racket, called the Chang Precision 730, was Prince's top seller in
1995 despite not reaching stores until September.

There were only about a half-dozen longer rackets on the market last year, and
they made up 8 percent of sales. Riley predicts that within three years, between
50 and 70 percent of rackets sold will be longer models. He calls it "the third
major revolution in rackets." The other two are not disputed: Prince enlarged
the head in 1976; Wilson widened the frame in 1987.

Longer rackets, legal under the 32-inch limit of the International Tennis
Federation, have come and gone since the 1940s, but not until the past year has
technology in materials and fiber design made them practical. Now, they're as
light and maneuverable as most standard rackets - and more powerful, especially
for serving.

Dunlop last summer reintroduced longer rackets, the Max Predator ($ 215) and
Enforcer ($ 190). Dunlop is now offering two powerful head- heavy Max Superlong
rackets ($ 225-240) and two Revelation Superlongs ($ 190-200) for advanced
players.

At the U.S. Open in September, Prince introduced its Chang Precision 730 ($
199), along with the more potent Rip Stick ($ 229) and Mach 1000 ($ 279). Prince
added six more affordable extra-longs this week that retail between $ 150 and $
190.

Wilson in September released the Sledge Hammer 2.8 Stretch ($ 269). Sales more
than doubled expectations, prompting the company to introduce four more in
Atlanta that are longer versions of its Hammer 6.2 and the Pro Staff Classic 6.1
rackets, the industry's top-selling rackets last year, and the Hammer 4.0.
They'll retail between $ 119 and $ 239 and be Wilson's best sellers, Wilson's
Heather Kinsella predicted. "The marketplace is demanding the latest and the
greatest," she said. "That's what's going to sell until all the fuss stirs
down."

Pro Kennex, Head, Yonex and Wimbledon promoted their first extra- longs this
week.

Pro Kennex, for one, scoffs at the notion that extra-longs are revolutionary.
Dave Duggin, the company's national sales manager, is marketing the Pro Kennex
Kinetic line over his extra-longs. The Kinetic rackets have a movable mass of
lead micro-bearings within small capsules of the racket frame, which, he said,
leads to less shock and more power. The racket actually sounds like a box of
salt when you shake it, but is designed to generate the ideal energy transfer
for optimal power and control.

"That's what we mean by new technology," Duggin said, "not just adding an inch
on the end of a racket. If you want to buy a racket that's being hyped and pay
the extra money, OK. But it may not fit your game."

Dimitrov goes ballistic; Smashes three rackets

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. S38

LENGTH: 444  words


Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov smashed three rackets on his way to losing the
Istanbul Open final to Argentine Diego Schwartzman on Sunday.

Second seed Dimitrov was one set ahead and 5-2 up in the second before
Schwartzman, the world number 87, fought back to win the his first ATP title
6-7(5) 7-6(4) 6-0. "I let myself down, I let my team down, I let my family down
with that behaviour," Dimitrov told reporters. "I started cramping at 5-2 in the
second set. It was very unfortunate that I couldn't close out the match. I have
to give credit to Diego."

Dimitrov, the world number 29, lost 11 of the last 12 games of the claycourt
match, smashing up two rackets along the way.

The world No. 29, trailing 5-0 in the third set, then broke up another racket
when level at 40-40 in the sixth game of the set, resulting in a match-ending
penalty.

MASTERSTON NODS Forwards Pascal Dupuis of the Pittsburgh Penguins, Jaromir Jagr
of the Florida Panthers and Mats Zuccarello of the New York Rangers were named
the three finalists for the 2015-16 Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy, which is
awarded "to the player who best exemplifies the qualities of perseverance,
sportsmanship and dedication to hockey," the league announced Sunday.

The local chapters of the Professional Hockey Writers Association (PHWA)
submitted nominations for the Masterton Trophy at the conclusion of the regular
season, and the top three vote-getters were designated as finalists.

The winner will be announced June 22, during the 2016 NHL Awards.

BEARS CUT ROLLE The Chicago Bears released veteran safety Antrel Rolle after one
injuryplagued season with the team.

Rolle, 33, played in just seven games due to ankle and knee injuries. He signed
a three-year, $11.25 million deal as a free agent in March, 2015.

Rolle didn't intercept a pass last season after accumulating 26 during his first
10 NFL seasons.

The three-time Pro Bowler had a career-high six interceptions in 2013 with the
Giants.

DEAL COMING FOR LUCK Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay hopes to get a contract
deal done with quarterback Andrew Luck done as soon as possible, but backed offa
bit on his earlier July 4th weekend timetable.

"Both sides believe soon the better if possible," Irsay said. "And both sides
believe sooner is possible."

Irsay added that the July 4th deadline was more of a guideline. Irsay said a
more workable completion date could be the start of training camp in late July.

YOUNGEST GRONK A BILL Glenn Gronkowski, a Kansas State fullback and the youngest
brother of Rob Gronkowski, agreed to terms with the Buffalo Bills as an
undrafted free agent.

Advantage, opponents: They use better rackets

BYLINE: Rachel Shuster

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 3C

LENGTH: 231 words


Bjorn Borg not only is at a disadvantage because of his eight-year layoff, but
he reduces his effectiveness by using a wooden racket instead of a modern
graphite or composite racket.

''Two things have driven the evolution of rackets: an increased stiffness and a
decreased weight,'' said Frank Garrett, racket technology director for Wilson
Sporting Goods.

''The stiffer the racket, the larger the sweet spot, and that's what players are
after. You're looking for more flexibility and power while reducing weight.''

Garrett said wood has low strength-to-weight and stiffness-to-weight ratios.

''When you reduce the weight in a wood racket, you're reducing from the head,''
he said. ''That's not what you want. Graphite is so strong and the material so
flexible, you can reduce the weight in the handle and the yoke.''

Compared to rackets with the newer composite materials - a combination of strong
fibers embedded in plastic - the wooden racket can be 11 times less stiff.

In tests published by Tennis magazine in August 1988, a wooden racket got the
lowest possible ranking for strength; the graphite racket received the highest
possible ranking.

''A player with a graphite or composite racket, if he hits the ball a little off
center, it's no big deal,'' Garrett said. ''But Borg doesn't have a sweet spot
as large. If he hits it a little off, it could be way off.''

Final set for PS Racquet Club

BYLINE: by Kevin Fung

SECTION: BANKRUPTCY

LENGTH: 364 words



HIGHLIGHT: The restorer of a historic property in will seek to have its case
dismissed.


Unable to obtain financing necessary to reorganize, bankrupt PS Racquet Club
Properties LLC will seek to have its case dismissed.

At a hearing scheduled for April 2 in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Central
District of California in Los Angeles, Judge Sheri Bluebond will consider the
real estate company's motion to dismiss its Chapter 11 case.

The debtor on Feb. 10 agreed to allow secured lender Vineyard Bank NArelief from
stay so it could continue a prepetition foreclosure action on PS Racquet Club's
sole property. PS Racquet Club originally opposed the motion but later consented
because of the debtor's failure to secure the necessary financing.

Palm Springs, Calif.-based PS Racquet Club, a real estate development company
whose main operations consist of the restoration of the historic Racquet Club of
Palm Springs, filed for Chapter 11 protection on Oct. 28, two days before a
scheduled foreclosure sale. It listed assets of $42.6 million and liabilities of
$15.2 million in its petition.

The Racquet Club of Palm Springs was originally founded in 1932 by Hollywood
actors Ralph Bellamy and Charlie Farrell, when they bought 200 acres of land and
built two tennis courts, court filings show.

Since 2006 PS Racquet Club has been responsible for restoring a 10-acre section
of the property, which will include the renovation of existing structures as
well as the construction of new residential townhouses.

PS Racquet Club originally planned to use its bankruptcy stay to find financing
to complete the development of the Palm Springs property and then sell it so the
proceeds could be used to pay back all secured and unsecured debt.

Vineyard Bank, owed roughly $12.48 million, provided $15.18 million in
prepetition funding and is the sole secured creditor.

Vineyard stopped permitting draws against the loan in September when it failed
to come to an agreement with the debtor's principals regarding an extension to
the maturity date. Vineyard declared a default on the loan, and the foreclosure
sale was scheduled for Oct. 30.

Mueller Design Inc. of Los Angeles holds the largest unsecured claim at
$560,680.

Debtor counsel is independent practitioner Carolyn Dye of Los Angeles.

6 USA Adult League teams advance to regionals

BYLINE: NANCY MORGAN

SECTION: NEIGHBORHOOD TIMES; TENNIS; Pg. 22

LENGTH: 728 words



The USA Adult League wrapped up local competition over the weekend, advancing
several teams to regional competition next month. Regional winners advance to
the state tournament with three other regional champions, and state champions
qualify for the national championships.

Outplaying local competitors were women's teams from Feather Sound Country Club
(3.0), the Renaissance Vinoy (3.5) and the Treasure Island Tennis and Yacht Club
(4.0), and men's teams from the Racquet Club (3.5 and 4.5) and Bardmoor Tennis
Club (4.0).

"Our match was very close with East Lake and really could have gone either way,"

 said Ruth Ann Ott, the Vinoy's 3.5 captain. "We just knew we had a burning
desire to win."

Before the playoffs, the Vinoy and East Lake were tied in overall record, with
East Lake having a slight edge in fewer regular-season games. In the playoffs,
both teams beat their first two opponents, then on Saturday the Vinoy edged East
Lake 3-2 to earn its first trip to regional competition.

Dianna Gabay in No. 1 singles and Kari Dickerson and Theresa Ross in No. 1
doubles scored the Vinoy's first two wins before a rain delay left the score at
2-1. Ott and partner Lisa Ulrich then won a three-setter for the team title.

The Racquet Club's 3.5 men's team had officially won its division after the
second weekend of playoffs by earning its second 5-0 victory. Saturday, however,
the team added a third 5-0 win againsta Royal Racquet Club.

"Some of us have been to regionals before and one of the things we learned is
you need depth to be successful," said Bob Dickerson, captain of the Racquet
Club 3.5 team. "This year we have five good doubles teams and backup singles
players."

Mike Williams and John McQuillen are key singles players for the Racquet Club,
said Dickerson, while Jeff Doty and Scott Johnston are formidable backups. Along
with singles wins by Doty and Johnston on Saturday were doubles victories by
Earl Gehart and Jack Weldon in No. 1, Neil Voss and Vaughn Haight in No. 2, and
Ray Scianci and Steve Uebel in No. 3. Scott Stewart and Bob Wahl round out the
team of 13.

Along with wins from Jeff Sprague in No. 2 singles and Don Kirby and Bill
Simmers in No. 2 doubles, Bardmoor's 4.0 men's team relied on Richard Farci to
survive a 2 1/2-hour, three-set match to assure a district title victory over a
stubborn Racquet Club team.

"We started off hot and had beaten the Racquet Club 5-0 in the season," said
Dickerson, Bardmoor's 4.0 team captain. "Then we fell back a bit but we're back
on top. We've now won seven matches in a row, and beating the Racquet Club in
the playoffs was good. They went to regionals last year and they're tough."

The 4.5 men's team from the Racquet Club has advanced to regional competition
the last three years, and two years ago qualified for the state tournament.
Saturday's 4-1 win over Royal Racquet Club assures a fourth trip. Winners in the
third and deciding match for the Racquet Club were Pat Brady in No. 1 singles
and T.J. Riley in No. 2, Steve Riley and Jeff Jullian in No. 1 doubles, and
Pierce Kelley and Tim Brady in No. 2.

Joining these teams as district champions but not required to compete in a
playoff are McMullen of Clearwater (women's 4.5), Safety Harbor Spa (women's
5.0), Feather Sound (men's 3.0) and Treasure Island Golf, Tennis and Recreation
Center (men's 5.0).

TEAM TENNIS: USA Team Tennis competition begins today for 10 teams representing
Lakewood Country Club, Isla Del Sol, Treasure Island Golf, Tennis and Recreation
Center, Treasure Island Tennis and Yacht Club, and Denver Park. Seven teams of
players ages 10 and older are competing in the White Division for intermediate
players, and three are in the Red Division for 10-and-under beginner and
advanced beginner players. Deborah Tuthill is the league commissioner and may be
reached at 867-9105.

SOUTH PINELLAS LEAGUE: The summer session of the South Pinellas Ladies Doubles
League reaches the halfway point today for the six participating teams. Today,
Lakewood Country Club hosts Treasure Island Tennis and Yacht Club, the St.
Petersburg Tennis Center C team is at Isla Del Sol, and SPTC A meets the SPTC B
team. Each match consists of two doubles matches.

Currently, SPTC C is in first place, with the SPTC A and B teams tied for
second. SPTC C won the spring AA session; Treasure Island the A.

Stars tie careers around rackets Williams sisters' success reflected in sales
upswing

BYLINE: Doug Smith

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 20C

LENGTH: 787 words


Pete Sampras wouldn't dream of arriving at the U.S. Open on Aug.
28 without an armful of his seemingly obsolete Wilson Pro Staff
tennis rackets.

The four-time U.S. Open champion has used the model since he was
14.

"It's an old-fashioned racket, not a wide body, not the high-technology
titanium stuff," Sampras says. "For me, power is not the issue.
It's control. That racket gives me the control and the power that
I need to have a fine balance."

Great Britain's Tim Henman feels the same about his Slazenger
Tour Braided model.

"It's a midsize, and I've never considered changing," Henman
says.

Gustavo Kuerten, who won the French Open with a Head Ti Radical,
says, "A racket is like your working tool. You have to feel confidence
in it. You have to put your hand on it and feel comfortable."

Several top-ranked male and female pros are firm, never fickle,
when asked about their weapons of choice on the tennis court.
As with Sampras, most top pros favor the same rackets they used
as juniors.

Technology helps game

Martina Hingis says her Yonex Ultimum Ti 1700 is "light, but
it gives me a lot of power and I still have control. You have
so many players hitting with power now. The racket technology
has really helped the women's game."

No. 5 Monica Seles swears by her Yonex. "The way ladies tennis
is going, having more power is really important," Seles says.
"The game is getting faster and faster."

Andre Agassi jump-started his game in the spring of 1999 when
he switched to the Head Ti Radical midsize. In an eight-month
span, Agassi won three Grand Slam titles -- 1999 French Open,
1999 U.S. Open, 2000 Australian Open -- and lost to Sampras in
the 1999 Wimbledon final.

Dave Haggerty, president of Head Penn Racquets Sports, says Agassi's
surge last year helped Head's bottom line.

"We ended up selling three times as many of those rackets during
that time," Haggerty said. "Agassi playing with the Ti Radical
and winning definitely had an impact."

John Embree, vice president of Wilson Racquet Sports, says Venus
and Serena Williams might be boosting his firm's racket sales,
as well.

Wimbledon champion Venus, 20, plays with a blue and black Wilson
Hyper Hammer 4.3 ($ 199); U.S. Open champion Serena, 18, uses a
black and yellow Hyper Hammer 6.3 ($ 159).

Wilson recently released three junior rackets (23-, 25- and 27-inch
models) endorsed by the Williams sisters. The company also sells
Rak Attaks, junior-sized rackets (21-, 23- and 25-inch models)
endorsed by Sampras.

"Andre sells rackets, and we think the Williams sisters, who
are getting a lot of exposure, sell rackets," Embree says.

Local teaching pros key to sales

Beads and friendship bracelets are used in the marketing of the
Williams' sisters rackets.

"Because of Venus and Serena, a lot of young girls are going
into sporting good stores now," Embree says.

Industry experts say a recent boost in the sales of balls and
prestrung rackets suggest that more people have been drawn to
the sport.

"New players are getting into the game and buying products,"
Embree says. "We are selling more rackets priced from $ 19 to
$ 59."

Although superstars such as Sampras and the Williams sisters provide
valuable exposure, Embree says local teaching pros, not superstars,
are the best promoters of their products.

"They (local teaching pros) have so much credibility in the eyes
of the people we are trying to reach," Embree says. "They're
the cornerstones of our marketing program. We know that they're
putting the first rackets in the hands of the new juniors and
the 45-year-old woman at a tennis club. Our focus has always been
at the grass-roots level because they determine the racket a player
will use."

Most top players tend to stay with the model they used as juniors.

Asked if he would consider switching rackets, Sampras says, "It's
a possibility I could look into something else. But at this point,
mentally, if it's not broke, you don't fix it."

A tip: The material makes the racket

BYLINE: SUSAN BIDDLE JAFFE

SECTION: CITY TIMES AND INDEPENDENT; TENNIS; Pg. 6

LENGTH: 646 words

DATELINE: ST. PETERSBURG



ST. PETERSBURG - Before he retired in 1969, Bancroft racket    craftsman Rene P.
Millette left the tennis world with these words:    "The wooden racket is like a
precious violin - it will never die."

     Who could blame Millette for thinking that way? For 94 years -    until
1967 - wood was the only material used in rackets.

     Still, Millette did concede that "I cannot say that steel or    aluminum
rackets do not have a future. I will only say right now these    modern metal
rackets are not yet the final answer. There are bugs in    them."

     As it turned out, both of Millette's statements proved correct.

     Today, while a few manufacturers continue to produce one or two    versions
of the wood racket, the sport is dominated by rackets made of    metal compounds
and man-made fibers. Most of today's rackets have foam    core surrounded by
materials like Kevlar, graphite, Boron and    fiberglass.

     While Millette didn't see just how important those early metal    rackets
would become, he was right that they still have a long way to    go.

     Today, the steel T2000 that put Wilson on the cutting edge of    racket
design in 1967 is as obsolete as the wood rackets it helped    eliminate. The
racket revolution continued with the introduction of    Prince's oversized
rackets. These days, rackets are light but still    strong.

      While racket manufacturers continue to find newer and better    materials
and designs, the annual explosion of new rackets, materials    and designs has
created a villain of its own - uninformed, intimidated    consumers.

      It seems that you can't escape it - that lonely, lost feeling that
comes with standing in front of a wall of unstrung rackets. And the
questions. Which one is best for me? They all look the same, is anyone    really
better than any other?

     Unfortunately, the only way to tell if you like the way a racket    plays
is to play with it. It may seem like a lot of extra trouble, but    use a
demonstration model of a racket if you can before you buy it.

     Knowing the basic materials and their characteristics can help.

 Here's a quick look at today's materials:        Steel - This traditional
material provides exceptional strength and    power. Wilson's T-series -
including the revolutionary T2000 - are    examples of steel rackets.

     Aluminum - Popular because of the wide range of head shapes that    can be
formed. Like steel, aluminum will provide both power and    durability.

     Graphite - Stiff and light, graphite provides a greater ratio of
strength-to-weight than wood, steel, aluminum or fiberglass. Many    players
find that a graphite racket best combines the feel of wood and    the power of
steel.

     Fiberglass - Often used in "composite" rackets. It is heavier    than
graphite yet not as stiff.

     Boron - Both stiffer and more expensive than graphite, Boron is
generally used sparingly to add stiffness and strength to specific    areas of
the racket.

     Kevlar - It is light and has high energy absorption for reduced
vibration.

     In general, better players use stiffer rackets while beginners are
better off with more flexible varieties. Still, you have to find what    you
like - you may be an excellent player who doesn't like the feel of    a stiff
racket.

     For a combination of stiffness and flexibility, you may want to    consider
a racket like the Kramer Staff, which is 80 percent graphite    and 20 percent
fiberglass. Graphite gives the racket strength while    fiberglass gives it
flexibility.

Brothers cause a racket

BYLINE: Whitey Reid, The Daily Progress, Charlottesville, Va.

SECTION: SPORTS

LENGTH: 1107 words


Nov. 5--Earlier this week at the Virginia National Bank Men's Pro Championship,
a person connected with the tournament -- evidently a tennis purist -- snarled
at the sight of Brian and Dann Battistone. He referred to the brothers as a
gimmick.

A short time later, a group of spectators literally stopped in their tracks when
they saw the Battistones playing their first-round doubles match at the Boar's
Head Sports Club. It was as if the circus had come to town.

The brothers, who grew up in Utah before moving to Santa Barbara, Calif., have
grown used to these types of reactions. After all, they are the only players on
tour who use rackets that one onlooker joked, "look like garden tools."

So what's all the fuss about?

Well, the Battistones play with rackets that seem like normal ones from a
distance. But, when you get a little closer, there is one glaring difference --
their rackets, which they grip like the aforementioned garden shears -- have two
handles. They almost seem like upside-down slingshots.

"From the beginning, people have called us clowns and said we'd never win a
match," said Dann Battistone, 33. "But slowly, we're just breaking down the
barriers. In 2008, we rose faster in the doubles rankings than any other team in
the world. I think it motivates us more than gets us down."

On Wednesday, the Battistones defeated Catalin Gard and Deniss Pavlovs 6-1,
7-6(5) to advance to the quarterfinals. Today, they play third-seeded Martin
Emmrich and Andreas Siljestrom.

The Battistones grew up in Salt Lake City playing basketball. They dreamed of
being the next John Stockton and Karl Malone.

When the brothers realized they had many things working against them to attain
that dream, they decided to focus on tennis.

Dann wound up playing collegiately at Boise State and Brigham Young, while
younger brother Brian, 30, played satellite tournaments.

It was while living in Los Angeles about eight years ago that Brian first got
the idea about the racket. A club pro saw him messing around on a court,
switching his racket from his left hand to his right hand after every stroke --
essentially hitting a forehand every time.

It just so happened that the pro's father, Lionel Burt, had invented a racket
that had two handles. He suggested that Battistone give it a whirl.

"To be honest, I thought there was just no way I was going to use it,"
Battistone said. "I took a look at it and I was like, 'This is interesting, but
I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do with it.'"

Skeptically, Battistone began practicing with it. Then, after about two or three
weeks, a light went on.

"I said, 'Whoa, I think I could actually use this thing,'" he said.

It was about three years ago, after Battistone had returned from a Mormon
mission, that he took the idea of the racket to family friend Jim Easton.
Easton, the head of Easton Sports, agreed to manufacture it in China. Prior to
that, Battistone was using a homemade one, held together by screws.

After the rackets were made, Battistone was able to get them approved by the
International Tennis Federation for all levels of play, and, subsequently, began
playing real matches with it.

The next step was getting Dann on board with the new technology. It wasn't an
easy thing since Dann was an assistant tennis coach at BYU at the time.

"I'm a little more traditional," Dann said. " He's always thought more outside
the box.

"My first reaction was, 'I don't think I can play with that thing.'"

His fellow coaches at BYU weren't exactly supportive, either.

"The head coach was like, 'If you use that thing, I don't know if we want you
here anymore,'" Dann recalled.

However, Dann eventually decided to try it -- and quickly became hooked, just
like Brian.

"You have the advantage of disguise, reach, power, stability," said Dann, when
asked about the racket's advantages.

Dann says he is able to get six more inches of reach with the racket on his
two-hand backhand. He says he has no loss of control and that the racket helps
him on his serve.

"It helps pronate the wrist and you get a little more action and spin on the
ball," he said.

Brian, meanwhile, uses the racket a little differently. His serve, which looks
like something off the pro beach volleyball tour, is worth the price of
admission. He throws the ball high into the air with one hand and switches the
racket back to that hand while in mid-air.

"I started experimenting with it because I wanted to get more height and angle
into the court," he explained.

When hitting groundstrokes, Brian's goal is to hit a forehand almost every time.

"I think that's the future of tennis," Dann said. "Traditionally, the forehand
is the weapon and the backhand is either solid or weak.

"Just imagine [Rafael] Nadal with two forehands. He gets extra reach, extra
power, and then if you could serve with both hands as well..."

Before taking time off from the tour about six months ago -- Dan wanted to be at
home with his wife and three young children -- the Battistones were ranked as
high as No. 150 on the tour.

The Battistones have had some nice wins. They've beaten the likes of John Isner,
who, if you recall, defeated Andy Roddick at the U.S. Open over the summer.

Certainly, the brothers have proved they're more than just a sideshow.

"We've gained a lot of respect from players just because we've had a lot of
decent wins," Dann said. "In fact, now a lot of them just want to try [the
rackets] out.

"I think, someday, the No. 1 player in the world will use this racket because
there are just so many advantages. We believe in the racket. If we knew we could
be No. 1 in the world playing with a snow shovel, then that's what we would play
with if it was legal.

"This is the racket we choose to play with because we feel we can play the best
tennis with it."

Because of their recent time off, the Battistones have slipped considerably in
the rankings. However, they say they are poised to make one last run. The dream
of going up against the Bryan brothers -- Bob and Mike Bryan, the No. 1 doubles
team in the world -- has replaced the Stockton and Malone fantasy.

"In the beginning, nobody thought we could win a match with [the racket] at the
open level, let alone have success on the pro tour," Dann said. "We've come a
long way."

ON YOUR OWN;
Sporting-Goods Makers Hawk Wares at Show

BYLINE: By BARBARA LLOYD

LENGTH: 1251 words

DATELINE: ATLANTA


THE sporting-goods industry did its best last week to ignore the recession. The
85,000 sports aficionados who gathered here for the industry's largest annual
trade exhibit -- the Super Show -- whet their appetites on a menu of new
technology sauteed in marketing hype.

With more than 1.6 million square feet of floor space and 6,000 booths at four
sites in the downtown area, mostly at the Georgia World Congress Center,
manufacturers unveiled exercise machines that talk back, tennis racquets that
sound heavy but feel light, shoes that spring off their heels, bicycles that
jump curbs and clothes that breathe.

Swarms of buyers for stores perused the show in search of items that would sell
in a flat retail market. Although the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association,
which stages the show, projected a 6 percent growth in the industry's wholesale
volume, from $30.8 billion in 1990 to $32.7 billion in 1991, the number fell
short of the double-digit expansion the industry had come to expect.

But insiders were buoyed by the recession-resistant nature of the industry.
"Sports have become a solid part of the modern-life style, and, therefore,
sporting-goods sales are less negatively affected in recessionary times," said
John D. Riddle, association president.

An Overview

 Lured by dazzling product displays, visitors to the show faced a marketing
barrage. From Joe Montana to Greg Norman, sports celebritries appeared as if
they were hors d'oeuvres in a dinner of corporate steaks.

Nike, the athletic-footwear manufacturer, spent $4 million on its booth. The
61,000-square-foot area featured Nike's newest shoes under robotic lights on
center stage. Reebok, dominated a $1 million space not far down the concourse
where aerobic dance skits, loud rock music and intermittent celebrity autograph
signings set a frenetic pace.

Lower-profile exhibitors staffed booths strung out with wares like an exotic
marketplace. Despite the enticements, most dealers seemed cautious.

"We're going to watch our spending," said Brad Henry, a buyer for Valley Sports
of Fresno, Calif. "We're not going to tie up our dollars far in advance."

The mood translated into a search for trends: something, anything to make the
public buy, buy, buy. Here are a few trends to watch for in your sport and
equipment of choice.

Tennis

Widebody racquets are still the industry favorites. But the new watchwords of
the 46 racquet manufacturers at the show are "lighter" and "more flexible."
First introduced by Wilson Sporting Goods in 1987, the widebody racquet was made
to be stiff and powerful. Today's versions are designed to put feel back in the
racquet and dampen shock. Racquets are lighter than ever: the 10-ounce barrier
has been broken.

"They are taking the fat out," said Tracy Leonard, equipment adviser for Tennis
magazine.

And finding ingenious ways to do it, too. Head's Genesis racquet, for instance,
is thinner in the cross sections. The Hammer, Wilson's newest high-end widebody,
has taken about two ounces out of the handle, but kept the same weight in the
head.

Prince introduced the Vortex widebody racquet at the show, its light weight
achieved with materials adopted from the aerospace industry: viscoelastic
polymer, a thermoplastic material, and continuous strands of carbon fiber. The
strings are staggered along the frame, an innovation designed to absorb more
impact from the ball.

Dunlop attacked the widebody's shock-absorption problem in a different way. With
its new Revelation racquet, introduced last month and on display at the show,
the company added vibration-dampening rods to the handle.

High-end racquets are closing in on $300. But the new technology is filtering
down to mid-priced racquets, too.

Footwear

 The leading footwear manufacturers set the tone of the show with fancy video
displays and Hollywood floor shows. But even more impressive was their sheer
numbers: more than 160 exhibitors of everything from basketball shoes to sandals
were on hand.

Other than L.A. Gear, which has produced the Catapult, a basketball shoe with a
heel spring, most innovations are directed at weight savings.

"The challenge is in finding a balance between light, and making a shoe with
cushioning, stability and support," said Bill Dragon, president of Avia.

New materials, like thermoplastics, carbon fiber and foams, are replacing
standard materials. Nike has taken the heel counter out of its new Haurache
running shoe and replaced it with a molded rubber heel strap.

And making it clear that they intend to follow their customers from the
basketball and tennis courts to the trails of the backwoods, the leading
manufacturers showed new lines of shoes and clothing for hiking, camping and
mountain biking.

"People who were exposed to running in the 1980's while they were single are
looking for activities they can do with their families in the 1990's," said Tom
Clarke, director of marketing for Nike.

Fitness

Weight machines, popular in the 1970's, are making a comeback for the home, said
Richard Miller, a buyer for The Gym Source, a New York City equipment
distributor. "Home use is the future," Miller said.

Companies like Pacific Fitness are making compact home-gym units that allow for
100 different exercises at a price of $1,600 to $2,400.

CSA Inc., a fitness-products manufacturer from South Easton, Mass., introduced
23 new exercise machines at the show, including several versions of computerized
talking machines that it began marketing last year. The units are designed to
verbally coach users, and to store previous workouts so they can be recalled for
comparison to a new routine.

Bike machines still appear to be more popular than treadmills and stairsteppers.

Traditional companies are diversifying. Life Fitness, the company that
spearheaded the stationary-bike movement, has designed a new stair machine this
year, Lifestep 5500, available this summer for $1,295.

Bicycling

Although bicycling is a fast-growing sport with a propensity for dramatic
innovation, only 19 bicycle manufacturers showed up in Atlanta. A recent study
by Bicycling magazine counted 32 million cyclists in the United States. In
recognition of this popularity, the Super Show opened its doors for a cycle show
for the first time. Although few of the leading manufacturers attended, signs of
trends surfaced, most noticeably in the cross bike.

As a hybrid of road and mountain bikes, the cross bike has thinner tires than a
mountain bike. It has a more central shifting system, and a sloping top tube.
"People are finding that the mountain bike is too much bike," said Chuck
McCullagh, publisher of Bicycling. "The cross bike is a bike that people can
ride for commuting or in-town use."

Apparel

Neon is out and deeper, richer tones and earth colors are in, reflecting a
pervasive embrace of the outdoors. Moreover, companies like Du Pont, Hind and
Nike, who make their own fabrics, are finding that function is blurring with
fashion.

"This crossover isn't necessarily a permanent thing because of the fickleness of
ready-to-wear," said Jennifer Lisle, fabrics editor at Sport Style, a biweekly
sports publication.

Function, however, still dominates. Lynn Hill, the top United States women's
rock climber, and Katarina Witt, the German Olympic skater, attended the Super
Show on behalf of Du Pont and Hind. Hill scaled artificial walls to demonstrate
how athletic tights "allow you to move with your sport."

College drinks to stout's us double

SECTION: Pg. 36

LENGTH: 247 words


Former Cheltenham College pupil James Stout has been crowned US Open Rackets
Champion in singles and doubles.

He triumphantly beat Neil Smith 15-5, 15-8, 15-13 at the Racquet Club of
Philadelphia, and then together with Smith won the doubles final 3-1.

Stout was a boarder at Cheltenham College from 1997-2002 and learned rackets
under the careful guidance of Karl Cook, master in charge of rackets, and Mark
Briers, the rackets professional.

Cook said: "James' reputation as a squash player was already firmly in place
when he arrived at Cheltenham.

"He picked up rackets extraordinarily quickly, loving the speed and the angles
involved. He was National schoolboy singles and doubles champion for two years
(2001 and 2002).

"This recent triumph, however, really does elevate James to a top six position
in the world.

"His experience as rackets and real tennis professional at the New York Tennis
and Rackets Club on 5th Avenue, together with his past successes in squash,
seems a winning combination.

"He is now seeded number two in next month's British Open at Queen's Club. I'm
delighted for him."

James' brother Chris is currently a boarder in his first year at Cheltenham
College, and he too is learning to master the game.

Rackets is a long-standing game started in the 18th Century, with both Oxford
and Cambridge universities having rackets courts built by 1855 in time for the
first ever varsity match.

Cheltenham College is one of only 14 schools in the UK where rackets is played.

TENNIS U.S. OPEN;
PLAYING OUT THE STRING;
Player superstition, rapid-fire turnaround - here's why stringing a racquet is
one of tennis's dark arts

BYLINE: CATHAL KELLY

DATELINE: NEW YORK


ckelly@globeandmail.com

Every day at the U.S. Open, Serena and Venus Williams will walk out to either a
practice court or a match with six racquets in their respective bags. They might
use two of them.

After every use, they will send all their racquets - including the ones still
wrapped in plastic - back to be restrung. This is the point where the
engineering that's added so much power to the modern game becomes mystic.

Stringing is one of tennis's dark arts - a combination of precision work and an
unquantifiable feel.

Many of the top pros - Milos Raonic among them - pay a dedicated service such as
Priority One Tennis to handle all their racquets. Priority One has a three-man
team in New York, working out of a Manhattan hotel.

Most players - which is to say, the ones not making big money - use an onsite
service. Here at Flushing Meadows, the work is done by a travelling team of
master technicians provided by Wilson.

The staff has been scouted from across the world, put through a boot camp,
tested and retested. One bad tournament and you're out.

They work out of an airy office alongside the garden where players hang out
between matches. It's a lovely contrast - the stars at rest, while one part of
the machine that makes their jobs possible hums behind them.

At 44, Joe Heydt is one of the veterans on the team. He runs a tennis pro shop
in Omaha, Neb. He's been stringing since he was 17. Two or three times a year,
he packs up to work a big tournament. Other guys in the shop will spend as many
as 300 days a year on the road, stringing for the team or individual players.

For Heydt, it's a lark rather than a living.

"Would I work here if they paid me five bucks a day? Probably."

But it's not quite a vacation.

"I string a lot at my shop. We do maybe 2,800 or 2,900 racquets a year. Here,
we'll do over 4,000 in three weeks. It's insane. When I get home, my fingertips
are like M&Ms."

Racquets are dropped off with the specifics - type of string, tension, pattern,
stencilling instructions. Some are a little odd - the lettering on the butt end
must face a certain way, or small lead weights must be taped to the racquet
frame at odd intervals. Each stringer is responsible for a stable of 30 or 40
players. The cost is $30 (U.S.) a racquet - a decent price, but it adds up.

"A lot of players don't string their racquets as often as they should, because
of the expense," Heydt says sadly.

While he talks, Heydt works, expertly weaving about 20 feet of roughly measured
string. He's able to maintain eye contact throughout the process. If he makes a
mistake, he can feel it during the next pull.

It's around noon - a slow time.

Most of those working are wearing headphones. The only sound is the intermittent
clacking as a framing machine is turned to attack a different angle.

Several stringers are lounged around on the floor, stretching.

One guy is giving another a very deep massage. Whether at work or not, all have
the thousandyard stare of men who do detailed work they've practised over many
hundreds of hours.

As play picks up through the day, the pace will get more frantic. Players are
superstitious. If they break a string during a match, they often want to use the
same racquet despite having others in their bag. This necessitates what's called
an 'on court.' A runner sprints the racquet back to the shop. Typically, it
takes 20 minutes or so to finish a racquet, including painting the branded
stencil on the face. During an on court, the Wilson team is expected to turn the
racquet around in less than 15 minutes.

This is where the war stories come from. The best of them involves Jared Magee,
an Australian. At an Australian Open, Magee handled Rafael Nadal's racquets.
During a night match, Nadal sent back a racquet. There were only two people
staffing the shop. Then he sent back another.

"How fast did you manage the second one?" Heydt asks teasingly as Magee walks
over.

"Eleven minutes," Magee drawls.

"Of course, Rafa has a pretty simple pattern," Heydt says teasingly.

Magee smirks and wanders off.

Everywhere you turn at an event like this, someone is making a name in his or
her particular professional world, big or small.

Since they have no on-site facility, players who use a dedicated service don't
get the benefit of on courts.

"We're consistent. We're the same guys they see every tournament," says Ron Yu,
one-third of the Priority One team. "That way, they get on the court, they don't
have to check their racquets when they pull them out of the bag."

This eliminates the "favourite racquet" problem.

"They all feel exactly the same," Yu says.

Regardless of who does the work, "the same" is a constantly changing metric. The
way a racquet feels out of the shop is not how it will feel a day later,
regardless of whether it's been used.

Heydt has just pulled through all of the vertical strings (or mains) on the
racquet he's working on. He ties off the end and points at it.

"Right now, this racquet is already losing tension. You can't stop it," Heydt
says. "Whether or not a player can tell the difference, who am I say? If they
say to me, 'When my stencil points the right way, I play better,' well, you
can't argue with that."

Smith places third in YAIAA tournament

Her string snapped, but Jess Smith didn't.

During warmups for the YAIAA Class AA Tennis Tournament on Monday, one of the
strings on the Delone Catholic High senior's racket broke.

The Squirette had never had to deal with the issue herself, but had seen it
affect how other players performed during matches. So, she was worried.

But those fears didn't get the best of her as she defeated York Suburban's Allie
Pandelidis 6-4, 6-2 and clinched a spot in the District 3 Class AA Tournament.

"I never really adjusted," she admitted. "But once I got that first set out of
the way, I was getting a lot more comfortable with the racket, hitting my
regular cuts, my lobs, my topspins and I was starting to go for the lines more.
I got a lot more comfortable after that first set."

Smith is excited about qualifying for the district field for the first time and
was happy with the way she performed, racket issues aside, she said.

"Allie's a great player," Smith said. "And I was glad that, despite the little
racket malfunction, I was able to come in with another racket and come out with
the win."

Smith explained she had to use Delone coach Denise Dunn's racket.

"Most girls have a backup racket," she said. "But I only hit with that racket
because I've never broken a string before in my life.

"So I was thinking, 'Oh my gosh, this is not a good start.' But I got to warm up
for a couple minutes with my coach's racket. It was about the same string
tension as my racket was, so I just went with it."

However, switching rackets wasn't easy.

"It's pretty difficult because you're used to that racket that you've played
with all year," she said. "My backup racket was my old racket that I used two
years ago and that is a lot heavier and I knew I wanted something light that was
similar to how I used to have a racket."

While Smith was battling with Pandelidis and her racket issues, York Suburban's
Katie Moritz defeated York Catholic's Angelina Ortenzio for the Class AA
championship, 6-2, 6-4.

In Class AAA, Dallastown's Katie Westenberger took the title over Central York's
Jennifer Learmonth, 7-5, 6-2.

Fellow Lady Wildcat Melissa Plowman won the consolation match against
Susquehannock's Amanda Mills.

Purchasing quality racquet shouldn't cost a fortune

BYLINE: ANY NIEDZIELKA; MIAMI HERALD

SECTION: SPORTS PLUS; (SPORTS); FITNESS/RECREATION; Pg. D10

DATELINE: MIAMI, Fla.


One of the most unsettling experiences is purchasing a tennis racquet. Some
questions facing you, a prospective buyer, include:

Do you want:

(a) Counteracting frame distortion and shaft torsion?

(b) Quadrants that respond with opposing frequencies that mutually and instantly
cancel out resonance?

(c) Shock-absorbing adhesive elastomers?

(d) An aspirin?

If you chose (d), please keep reading. The average buyer does not need a Ph.D.
in physics -- or a physicist's income -- to buy a decent racquet. Just ask Lacey
Smith of Spalding, who says the difference between a $ 325 racquet and a $ 139
racquet, in some cases, has nothing to do with quality.

"They have to make that racquet $ 325 because they spent $ 10 million
advertising that racquet," he said. "The $ 139 racquet they didn't advertise."

What follows are some simple guidelines for the beginning-to-intermediate player
for purchasing a racquet. (Serious players by now probably have figured it all
out.) Thanks are due to Jimmy Evert (the father of Chris), as well as Smith and
Dave Reinhart of Spalding who left brand names out of our discussions.

First, let's get acquainted with racquet-speak: Racquets come in various head
sizes -- mid-size, mid-plus, oversize and full oversize; frame widths --
mid-wide, standard-wide and super-wide; as well as different weights and degrees
of stiffness.

Racquets are made from a variety of materials (graphite, fiberglass, ceramic,
graphite composites, among others) and have varying shock-absorbtion systems.
They can cost anywhere from $ 30 to nearly $ 400.

Don't be intimidated, though. Buying a good racquet is mostly a matter of
finding one that feels right. Jimmy Evert said most buyers prefer light racquets
(about 10 ounces), but otherwise preferences vary.

Some guidelines:

A novice or a player with below-average strength should consider:

*

A wide body (for power).

*

An oversize (for plenty of hitting area).

*

A flexible frame (for control). Intermediate players should consider:

*

A standard-wide (for control).

*

A mid-size (for manoeuverability).

*

A stiff frame (for power). Note: the super-stiffness of the most expensive
racquets (the 100 per cent graphite ones, for example) forces your arm -- rather
than the racquet -- to absorb much of the shock of each collision with the ball.

The stronger your arm, the more suited it is for a stiff racquet.

For all players, the most important thing is to make sure you play with the
racquet before you buy it.

Most sporting-goods stores have demos that you can try out. Comfort should come
before cost. Good racquets can be found in the $ 80-$ 125 range.

It's playoff time for USA Adult League teams

BYLINE: NANCY MORGAN

SECTION: NEIGHBORHOOD TIMES; TENNIS; Pg. 22

LENGTH: 744 words



Action begins Saturday for men and women in several divisions.

Playoffs begin Saturday for the local USA Adult League women's and men's
divisions.

In women's competition, a five-team playoff has been scheduled by coordinator
Carol Levin for the 3.0 division, with undefeated Feather Sound Country Club the
top seed, followed by the Renaissance Vinoy with just one loss in the 10-team
division. Crescent Oaks, East Lake Woodlands and McMullen complete the
round-robin lineup.

"We're expecting to do really well," said Terri Anderson, captain of the Vinoy
team. "Even though this is just our third year together, we've been working
really hard and getting help from our pros. We're all really hopeful to do
well."

Saturday morning, the Vinoy hosts McMullen and East Lake travels to Feather
Sound.

The 3.5 teams from the Vinoy and East Lake tied in records (8-1) and points
earned (33), so Levin counted fewest sets lost in the season to determine the
top seed for the playoff. East Lake lost two fewer sets and is seeded first in
the four-team playoff.

"With the results being so close during the season," said Levin, "it should be a
really close playoff."

East Lake meets Feather Sound on Saturday while the Vinoy hosts Innisbrook.

East Lake again is top-seeded in the 4.0 division with an unbeaten record and
after handing Treasure Island Tennis and Yacht Club its only loss. Saturday,
East Lake hosts Bardmoor and the Racquet Club travels across town to face
Treasure Island in the opening of a three-week playoff.

The women's 4.5 division is still under way, with McMullen expected to win its
division again. Safety Harbor Spa was unchallenged in the 5.0.

For the men, coordinator Peter Laker has planned competition the next three
weeks for the 3.5, 4.0 and 4.5 divisions. Feather Sound was named the 3.0
champion among six teams and the Treasure Island Rec Center was the 5.0 winner.

Division winners Countryside, Racquet Club and Bardmoor join wild card Royal
Racquet Club in the 3.5 playoff beginning Saturday, with Royal at Countryside
and the Racquet Club hosting Bardmoor.

The Racquet Club also won its division in the 4.0 and 4.5. Saturday, the Racquet
Club hosts wild-card team East Lake in the 4.0 and wild-card McMullen in the
4.5. Also scheduled in the 4.0 is Bardmoor at Countryside and Royal Racquet at
Safety Harbor Spa.

Playoff competition in all divisions continues June 12 and concludes June 19,
with the winner in each division advancing to the July 23-25 regional
competition in Longboat Key. There, the winners qualify for the state
tournament.

SENIOR/SUPER SENIOR SECTIONALS: Area teams came up short at last month's state
championships. Despite sending five teams from the USA Super Senior League
(60-and-older) and seven from the USA Senior League (50-and-older), no area
teams returned with first- or second-place finishes.

The St. Petersburg area was represented by the Shipwatch Tennis Club in both the
super senior and senior 4.0 competitions, along with Treasure Island Tennis and
Yacht Club's 4.0 senior women's team and the St. Petersburg Tennis Center's
senior men's 3.5 squad. Sarasota won the women's 4.0, Palm Beach Gardens the
men's 3.5, Plantation the senior men's 4.0, Bradenton the super senior 4.0.

JUNIORS IN CLEARWATER: Rachel Silverberg of Gulfport leads a contingent of
Pinellas players who won singles titles in last month's Memories in Clearwater
state-sanctioned tournament at the McMullen Tennis Complex. In the girls
14-and-under final, Silverburg defeated Bradenton's Tiffany McLoughlin in
straight sets. Also winning in straight sets were Oldsmar's Morgan Frank in the
girls 10s, Dane Vernon in the boys 16s,  and Tarpon Springs' Luke Bodine in the
boys 10s.

This weekend, juniors can test their talents again at the Tampa Palms Tennis and
Athletic Club in the Junior Clay Court Championships. Call Jonathan Clark at
(813) 632-1676 by today's deadline.

SOUTH PINELLAS LADIES: Six teams began competition last month in the summer
session of the South Pinellas Ladies Doubles League, including three from the
St. Petersburg Tennis Center and one each from Lakewood Country Club, Isla Del
Sol and Treasure Island Tennis and Yacht Club. Teams play Wednesday mornings
through July 21. Each team includes two doubles positions.

Last session, the St. Petersburg Tennis Center C team won the AA Divison and
Treasure Island won the A. This session, all teams are in the same grouping.

IT'S THE '90S - SO JUST SWING WITH A LONGER RACKET

SECTION: SPORTS, Pg. 3D, ON TENNIS

LENGTH: 687 words


In the '70s, the ''oversized'' racket was developed as a sure way to improve. It
worked. A bigger sweet spot enabled players to get more balls back.

Then the wide-body frame was the success of the '80s. Players using it got more
power and control in a racket that was both light and flexible.

The '90s? We are entering the era of the extra-long racket. Major manufacturers
are pushing 29-inch rackets, which is about 2 inches longer than traditional
length.

They are showing up on U.S. courts in limited numbers, but the racket companies
are optimistic. A memo from a regional Prince sales manager, for instance,
projects that within three years, fully half of the country's club players will
be using the long model.

Most teaching pros in Maine say that players who want to improve will want to at
least try the new models.

''I definitely think the long rackets will take off in the '90s,'' said Mark
Beede, president of the New England division of the United States Tennis
Association.

''Most players using it get more power, especially on the serve. There's a big
adjustment involved, but I think more players are going to try it - and then use
it on a regular basis.''

The advantage of the long racket is power. The longer shaft enables a server to
put more crunch to the ball, as well as hitting it from a higher point of
contact (thus improving the angle that it takes into the service court).

The highly publicized example of Michael Chang appears to confirm this selling
point. Chang, a 5-foot-8 right-hander who used to serve at about 110 mph, was
able to improve velocity to an impressive 126 mph.

That startling improvement was echoed recently in Maine. Lewiston's John Webber,
who plays for Providence College, recently appeared at a youth clinic. His
service with a ''regular'' racket was timed at 97 mph. After he had warmed up
with a long Dunlop, his serve was clocked at 116 mph.

Such weapons are appearing more frequently on local courts, but local pros say
it's too soon to tell whether there will be a stampede to convert.

''Everyone who tries them seems to like them,'' said Chan Bearce, teaching pro
at Portland Country Club and the Portland Athletic Club.

''Seniors especially like them. They don't have to bend as much, and they say
they can get to more wide balls. Plus everyone wants more power, especially on
the serve. If it can deliver on that, they could be very popular.''

Dan Veilleux, teaching pro at the World Gym and Fitness Center, added, ''I
haven't played with one myself, but I understand the principle that the longer
racket will help the serve.

''It might take club players a while to get used to it, though. I understand it
was six months before Michael Chang would actually compete with it on tour.''

There are several down sides to the longer racket. Many pros who have used them
say it is difficult to volley, particularly balls that are hit right into the
body. ''It's easy to get jammed,'' one pro said.

And there are some questions about the long-term effect on the elbow and
shoulder. Dan Santorum, president of the U.S. Professional Tennis Registry, says
that the rackets haven't been tested to determine how much stress they put on
the player.

''The manufacturers pushed them onto the market without medical testing,'' said
Santorum, who recently led a teaching clinic at Westerly Winds in Westbrook.
''There's a big unknown as to whether they'll create tennis elbow, and problems
like that.''

Another unknown is how long it takes to convert. Beede, for instance, has been
experimenting with elongated Wilsons but hasn't used them for major matches.

He plays national tournaments (he's ranked No. 17 in the U.S. in 40-and-over),
and evidently doesn't want to lose matches because of unfamiliar equipment.

''I've tried long rackets, but I've not switched because I just don't know
enough about the period of adjustment,'' he said.

''Anyway, the deficiencies in my game won't be solved just by using a different
racket.''

Dyke Hendrickson, a former sports writer for The Portland Newspapers, is an avid
tennis player.

Helping to 'Spread the Love' The Sports Shed donates tennis rackets to Chicago
children

SECTION: NEIGHBOR; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 535 words


Because of her go-getter style, 160 Chicago schoolchildren can now take to their
local tennis courts this summer with a nice racket.

Upon learning that a young Chicago tennis professional was falling short of his
goal to donate tennis rackets to Chicago Public School students, Tina Sernett
instantly knew what she had to do: As proprietor of The Sports Shed, a nonprofit
sporting goods cooperative, the Vernon Hills mom began to make phone calls and
work her volunteer network.

Less than a week later, Sernett's small SUV pulled up to Tuley Park on Chicago's
South Side, loaded with 50 rackets -- many of them new -- and just in time for
the year-end, Chicago Public School tennis championships for its sixth-,
seventh- and eighth-graders.

For her, there was no greater reward than seeing the kids' faces light up the
moment she pulled into the tennis court parking lot.

Through a friend, Sernett learned that Vasiliy Guryanov, 24, was staging a
one-person campaign to collect gently used tennis rackets for the Chicago Public
Schools. A graduate of Von Steuben High School, his "Spread the Love" campaign
was Guryanov's way of thanking the school system's tennis program for keeping
him interested in his studies.

The Uzbekistan native today works full-time as an associate at Midtown Tennis
Club in Chicago. He specializes in restringing tennis rackets and last year won
a speed-stringing Grand Slam Stringer contest in Orlando. So enthusiastic about
making this donation, Guryanov even talked Midtown into offering a 10 percent
pro shop discount to members who donated a racket.

But a week before the May 24 championships, Guryanov was worried that he
wouldn't be able to meet his goal of donating 150 rackets.

Enter Sernett, who last year founded The Sports Shed to collect used sporting
equipment from moms like herself, and then put them into the hands of social
service agencies.

Previous recipients include Girls in the Game and Mercy Home for Boys and Girls
-- both based in Chicago -- and the Boys & Girls Club of Lake County.

The Sports Shed has collection bins in several locations, including the Vernon
Hills Park District Sullivan Center, 635 Aspen Drive, and Sports 11, 838 S.
Milwaukee in Libertyville. It also has an arrangement with the Vernon Hills
Cougar Youth Athletic Association to collection items at certain events.

"When I heard about Vasiliy, I knew that, with a little work, I could help him
meet his goal," Sernett says. "Of course, the chance to make kids happy with the
gift of sports equipment is my goal, obviously, so we had that in common."

And seeing Sernett arrive -- just as she had promised -- with an armful of
rackets before the start of the tournament made Guryanov very happy.

"To me, Tina is the 'Mother Teresa' of sports equipment," says Guryanov,
grinning.

With Sernett's assistance, he even exceeded his goal. Together, they handed out
160 tennis rackets to eager kids just as they were to take to the courts for
their matches.

"Two weeks ago, I'd never heard of Tina or The Sports Shed," Guryanov said. "And
then, out of the blue, here she comes with all these tennis rackets," he said.
"Isn't life funny that way? Now we're making plans to 'Spread the Love' even
more for next year."

Davies sets his sights on the top; Rackets

BYLINE: WILLIAM STEPHENS

SECTION: Issue 63295.

LENGTH: 260 words


Wayne Davies, the world real tennis champion, has declared 1989 to be a year in
which he will concentrate on breaking into the top echelon of rackets. Davies,
who emphatically won his first defence of the Real Tennis title last November,
has stated his wish to challenge for the world rackets championship on the basis
of having won the US professional singles championship in 1987. The world title
is held by James Male, of Britain, who won it last March.

Davies and his predecessor as head professional at the New York Racquet and
Tennis Club, Graham Hyland, are the first Australian professionals known to
excel at rackets.


In present circumstances, Davies's challenge is unlikely to be sanctioned by the
North American Racquets Association since his ambitions suffered a setback last
weekend in Boston when he lost his US professional title to Shannon Hazell, the
Clifton professional. Hazell defeated Neil Smith, the British professional
champion, 3-1 in the final. Davies was eliminated by Hazell 3-1 while Smith beat
Steve Tulley, the Montreal professional, 3-0.

Davies will enter the British Open rackets championship in March, but his first
challenge at singles with the top United Kingdom (and world) amateurs comes in
the US Open championship which begins today at the Racquet Club of Philadelphia
the event being held there to celebrate the club's centenary.

Davies is seeded No. 8 and drawn to play Male. The other leading Britons
competing are Smith, William Boone, John Prenn, Hazell, Tulley and Rupert
Owen-Browne.

If Cohen Strings 'Em, Chang Will Swing 'Em

Sean Jensen , Washington Post Staff Writer

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. E05

LENGTH: 504 words


Since he's been in Washington for the Legg Mason Tennis Classic, Michael Chang
has had 27 rackets strung. But the two-time defending tournament champion is
particular. Not anyone can string his rackets. After trying out a few different
candidates, Chang chose Bryan Cohen of Rockville to become his personal stringer
after the Legg Mason last year. Cohen, 27, has been stringing rackets for about
half of his life and now travels around the world with Chang.

During matches, Cohen usually sits somewhere so he can see Michael and Carl
Chang, who coaches his brother. Sometimes, Cohen will be given a signal by Carl
to string up another racket with either a higher or lower tension, depending on
what Michael wants.

In a match, Chang rotates through several rackets, generally using four or five.
When Chang reached the semifinals of the U.S. Open last year, he had Cohen
string 92 rackets. "If the strings get soft, the balls will tend to fly and
Michael will lose some control," said Cohen, who attended Wootton High.

On the road, Cohen carries several duffel bags, including a 120-pound case -- 2
1/2 feet high, 4 feet wide -- which contains his stringing machine. Several
hours before Chang defeated Jim Courier last night, Cohen was busy stringing
rackets. "If they sit around too long, they'll lose tension," Cohen said,
explaining why he didn't string the rackets much earlier.

Cohen could not be more pleased about working for Michael and Carl. "They're
quiet in general," Cohen said. "They're a very close-knit family, and they've
been extremely nice to me. They're very appreciative of what I do."

Chang, Andre Agassi, Pete Sampras and Boris Becker of Germany are the only
players who have personal stringers, Cohen said.

Bryans Are Double Trouble

Twin brothers Mike and Bob Bryan overcame an early deficit to advance into the
semifinals of the doubles draw at the Legg Mason Tennis Classic, defeating David
DiLucia and Michael Sell, 4-6, 6-3, 6-2. Relying on strong service games and
quick reflexes at the net, the Bryans continue to roll in their professional
debut in an ATP Tour event.

"This is the best tournament we've had in our lives," Mike said. "To be pros for
three weeks and already be in an ATP Tour semifinal is amazing."

The Bryans remain undefeated in 17 professional matches, and have not lost a
match since losing in April to the team they will face in the semifinals: South
Africans Grant Stafford and Kevin Ullyett.

While collegiate players at Stanford, the Bryans were beaten by Stafford and
Ullyett in the quarterfinals of a professional event in Atlanta, 6-3, 6-3.

Osorio's Ordeal

Marko Osorio of Mexico had a long Thursday. He had an 8 a.m. tour of the White
House, then played a quarterfinal doubles match with his partner, Bobby Kokavec.
But because of a 90-minute storm delay, the match started late and did not end
until 2:24 a.m. But Osorio and Kokavec won, defeating Israel's Eyal Ran and
Switzerland's Filippo Veglio in a third set tiebreaker.

Howard Brody, 83, Expert in Physics of Tennis, Dies

BYLINE: By MARGALIT FOX

SECTION: Section B; Column 0; Obituary; Pg. 14

LENGTH: 742 words


Howard Brody, the world's foremost physicist of tennis, who explored what
happens when the stoppable force known as a ball meets the movable object called
a racket, died on Aug. 11 in Bryn Mawr, Pa. He was 83.

The cause was complications of Parkinson's disease, his family said.

At his death an emeritus professor of physics at the University of Pennsylvania,
where he spent his entire career, Professor Brody began his professional life as
a particle physicist before a chance encounter in the 1970s led him to train his
eye on tennis.

With the myriad potential variations in the materials used in a racket, the
tension of its strings, the composition of the court surface and the
construction of the ball, to say nothing of the speed, heft and angle of the
player's limbs, tennis is made for a physicist. Professor Brody was the first to
make it the object of serious scientific scrutiny.

In so doing, he created a field of inquiry whose objects of study collectively
read like found poetry: ''percussion centers,'' ''dwell times,'' ''asymmetric
deflections,'' ''restitution coefficients,'' ''vibration nodes.''

His findings have pragmatic implications for players of all levels seeking to
improve their game.

Professor Brody, who appeared often on television and radio, was a science
adviser to the Professional Tennis Registry, which represents 15,000 teachers
and coaches around the world, and a technical adviser to the United States
Racquet Stringers Association.

An ardent amateur player, he was the author of two books for a general
readership, ''Tennis Science for Tennis Players'' (1987) and, with Rod Cross and
Crawford Lindsey, ''The Physics and Technology of Tennis'' (2002), as well as
scores of scientific articles.

Howard M. -- the M stood for nothing -- Brody was born in Newark on July 11,
1932. He earned a bachelor's degree from the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, where he played on the varsity tennis team, followed by master's and
doctoral degrees from the California Institute of Technology. He joined the Penn
faculty in 1959.

Vacationing in Florida in the 1970s, Professor Brody caught sight of a Prince
racket, the oversize racket designed by the engineer Howard Head and recently
introduced to the market. The racket piqued his professional curiosity: Did its
size make it better, and if so, how?

None of the tennis professionals he consulted knew the answer, and he resolved
to find out.

In a lab filled with lasers and mirrors and oscilloscopes, Professor Brody set
to work, focusing in particular on the interaction -- sometimes companionable,
sometimes not -- between ball and racket.

A specific area of inquiry was the racket's percussion center, known in popular
parlance as the sweet spot. The percussion center is the place on a racket's
head that, when struck, does not vibrate, creating a torque-free still point.

On oversize rackets, Professor Brody learned, the percussion center tends to
reside closer to the head's physical center, making such rackets, for many
players, easier to use.

Other findings upended long-held beliefs. Professor Brody discovered, for
instance, that stiffer rackets let the ball be hit with greater power than more
flexible ones do. The same holds for looser strings as opposed to tighter ones.

''The less the tension in the strings, the more they deform and the larger the
amount of energy they store and give back,'' Professor Brody told The New York
Times in 1979. ''And the less the ball deforms, the less energy it loses.''

However, he added: ''There's a limit to how loose the strings should be. A
butterfly net would clearly be no good.''

A longtime Philadelphia resident, Professor Brody was a member of the technical
commission of the International Tennis Federation, the science committee of the
United States Tennis Association and the technical advisory panel of Tennis
magazine.

Professor Brody's wife, the former Lois Chase, whom he married in 1954, died in
2011. His survivors include two daughters, Victoria Stevenson and Deirdre
Bernstein; a brother, Stuart; and five grandchildren. Another daughter, Lisa
Brody Foley, died in 1991.

Over the years, Professor Brody was asked whether his tennis research had
improved his own game. In that respect, he replied ruefully, he was a victim of
his own success.

''If I had spent as much time on the courts as I've spent in the lab,'' he told
The Philadelphia Inquirer in 1988, ''I'd be a great player.''

Court-savvy Forum recovers costs of flaccid racket

SECTION: Pg. A7

LENGTH: 665 words


Last week, we left Sarah Thurston and her dad standing on a tennis court in Cape
Elizabeth with a "boingless" $129 Slazenger Pro X1 racket she had purchased
online from Top Sports Limited of Burbank, Calif.

There was obviously something wrong with the new, never-used item. The strings
lacked the tension essential for adequate play. So, certain the company would
make good, Dad Thurston e-mailed Top Sports describing the problem. At first Top
Sports did not reply at all. But after increasingly threatening e-mails from the
angry dad, they answered. But it wasn't the answer Sarah wanted.

"We are sorry," wrote Top Spot, "but we have no idea how the racquet has been
treated since it was shipped so you will have to deal with the manufacturer,
they are responsible for honoring their warranty."

So Mr. Thurston contacted Dunlop/Slazenger in South Carolina. The company told
him to ship the racket to them for inspection. He did so, but three weeks later
the racket was back on his doorstep. "The racquet," Dunlop/Slazenger wrote, "has
apparently been subjected to extremes of high temperature that partially melted
the material, thus causing the webbing to lose its tension. This violates the
terms of the warranty."

Frustrated and angry, Dad Thurston began the all-too-familiar "consumer quest,"
contacting attorneys general, better business bureaus, chambers of commerce, and
others with no success. Now and again he heard the same phrase: "We do not
customarily involve ourselves with Internet disputes." He was about to give up
when he was watching the morning talk show "So Goes The Nation," which
originates in Bangor and is broadcast on FOX TV in Bangor and Portland.
Coincidentally, COMBAT's executive director was the program's guest host that
morning.

Thurston immediately contacted COMBAT. "I am frustrated past belief and angered
at my daughter's disappointment. They say COMBAT does magic, let's see. I have
enclosed my $25 membership ... go get 'em!"

Then something serendipitous occurred. In the course of COMBAT's research on Top
Sports Limited, we discovered that the company often trafficked in merchandise
they had obtained from damaged stores after calamities such as earthquake,
flood, or fire. FIRE? Didn't Dunlop/Slazenger say the racket had been damaged by
extremes of heat?

Armed with the speculation that Top Sports may have purchased tennis equipment
from a fire-damaged store, the COMBAT mediation volunteer contacted the
unresponsive company with the following, knowing full well we hoped to bluff our
way to success.

"We are convinced, after having the racket analyzed by Dunlop/Slazenger and
following up on fires in sporting goods stores in California and Nevada, that it
is likely you sold Sarah Thurston distressed merchandise while representing it
to be new. We must, therefore, insist that you tender a full refund to our
client, shipping and handling costs included. Failing that instruction, you will
leave us no choice but to refer the matter to the California attorney general,
Federal Trade Commission, and Interstate Commerce Commission for an examination
of your questionable business practices and possible misrepresentations."

Two weeks later, Sarah Thurston had her $136.29 back. "I am so impressed," wrote
Dad Thurston, "all this tax money spent on government agencies that couldn't do
anything, but a letter from COMBAT got it done!" He went on to report that, as a
loving dad, he had already bought Sarah a replacement racket (in a local store)
and told her to keep the refund for another tennis outfit.

A happy girl, a happy dad, a case closed, and a good story. Did COMBAT "ace"
that service or what?

The Latest Tennis Racquet

BYLINE: By Barbara Lloyd

SECTION: Section C; Page 11, Column 1; Sports Desk

LENGTH: 202 words


Tennis racquet design has become an engineering quest that pits technology
against last year's models. The latest design is Prince's Constant Taper System
(CTS), due on the market by September. There are two models: the CTS Approach, a
100 percent graphite racquet with maximum firmness, and the CTS Graduate, a
graphite composite that is less stiff.

''We have strengthened the tip of the racquet, traditionally the weak point, to
make the racquet firmer,'' said Bob Long, director of racquet sports for Prince
Manufacturing, based in Princeton, N.J.

The racquet is tapered from the tip of the frame, its widest point, to just
above the grip, where it is narrowest. In cross section, the frame at the tip is
25 percent wider than traditional racquets'. The GTS frame tapers from about an
inch at the tip to about three-quarters of an inch at the neck, the width
overall of a normal frame. The tapered frame is designed to lower the flex point
and expand the sweet spot.

To offset the stiffness, the handle's base is molded of thermoplastic rubber and
is designed to dampen vibration through the cushioned grip. The racquets will be
sold in two head sizes, 90 and 110 square inches, for about $200-$250.

Richard Squires, 72, Racket Sports Expert

SECTION: Section C; Column 5; Sports Desk; Pg. 16

LENGTH: 238 words


Richard C. Squires, who built a career on racket sports, including serving as
publisher of tennis magazines, died Wednesday at his home in Rowayton, Conn. He
was 72.

The cause was emphysema, his wife, Dr. Joan Finn Squires, said.

Mr. Squires won national titles in three racket sports: tennis, squash and
platform tennis. He was versatile enough to compete in a sport he had never
played before, frontenis, in the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City. Frontenis,
a Latin-American racket game played on a three-walled court, was a demonstration
sport at the Games.

He went on to a successful business career, designing and operating the Downtown
Racquet and Fitness Club in New Haven; becoming national advertising manager for
Tennis Magazine; and publishing Tennis Buyer's Guide and Tennis USTA, both of
which were owned by The New York Times at the time.

He also wrote several books about racket sports, including "Play Platform
Tennis"; he did much to popularize platform tennis.

Mr. Squires was born Sept. 27, 1931, in Manhattan and spent much of his youth in
Bronxville, N.Y. In 1953, he graduated from Williams College, where he was
captain of the tennis and squash teams.

He is survived by his wife; his son, Gary Willard Squires of Pound Ridge, N.Y.;
his daughters, Cathleen Ruth Squires of Rowayton, Conn., and Pamela Susan Reiss
of Fairfield, Conn.; eight grandchildren; and his sister, Susie Leighton of
Duxbury, Mass.

How Much String for 500 Rackets?

BYLINE: By HOWARD BLAS

SECTION: Section CT; Column 0; Connecticut Weekly Desk; Pg. 2

LENGTH: 135 words


New Haven

EVERY August, Chris Gaudreau, who owns the Racquet Koop here, and four employees
set up shop in a trailer and spend up to 17 hours a day stringing about 500
tennis rackets during the nine-day Pilot Pen tournament. The Pilot Pen,
beginning  this weekend at the Connecticut Tennis Center at Yale University,
ends on Saturday.

Mr. Gaudreau, 39, of Branford, who played tennis at Wethersfield High School and
Central Connecticut State University, started working at the Racquet Koop in
Hartford the day after he graduated from college, in 1991. Later that year, he
opened his own store in New Haven.

''We began working the Pilot Pen when it was two years old,'' in 1994, Mr.
Gaudreau said.

This year, Serena Williams, the eight-time Grand Slam champion, is making her
first appearance in the tournament.

   At Curtis Racquets we use only the best cane and do not sell inferior
products. The racquets we sell to beginners or Pony Clubs are the same racquets
we sell elite representative players. We do not differentiate and do not
compromise when it comes to Quality.  All our cane is quality Manau or Tohiti
Cane sourced from the jungles of South East Asia. Any cane that does not meet
our high standards is either returned or discarded.  The same care and attention
we give to selecting the cane for our racquets is given to selecting everything
from the string in the net to the grip on the handle. All our racquets are hand
crafted on site. The process begins by selecting the cane and matching it to an
appropriate head and finishes by platting each individual net that goes into a
Curtis Racquet. This is how we differ from our competitors. Because we are
personally involved with every step of the manufacturing process you can buy
with confidence knowing that each racquet that bears the Curtis Logo is of the
highest quality available.  We know that producing the finest polocrosse
racquets available is only one step in ensuring our customer's satisfaction. At
Curtis we pride ourselves on our after sales service. If you encounter a
problem, or your racquet requires repair, simply contact us and let us know what
we can do to help you.  Order a Curtis Racquet today and discover the difference

An upper crust, all-Male racket if ever there was one;
Centre stage

BYLINE: Pete Nichols

SECTION: The Guardian Sports Page; Pg. 7

LENGTH: 797 words


THERE is a mystery to some sports. If once you wandered on the hill at Harrow
past Winston Churchill's Alma Mater, through the churchyard where Lord Byron's
tomb contained anything but Byron and down those steep slopes, you would have
stumbled upon a walled court wherein (to give the story an antique tone) they
once played fives - and maybe still do. Children who came from schools at the
bottom of the hill had little idea what the courts were actually for. The
knowledge of certain sports set and sets you apart.

This weekend, the second leg of the World Rackets Championship takes place at
Queen's in west London. Among the general population, if the occasion has any
effect at all it is more likely to slow pulses rather than quicken them for
rackets (like real tennis, fives and the Eton wall game) has never changed the
company it keeps. James Male, an Old Radleian naturally, is the reigning rackets
world champion and has been since, it feels, they used to play against the walls
of the Fleet Prison where the sport was cradled.

If that conjures up images of Charles Dickens' dad taking on all-comers, don't
linger on them. The family Dickens would have been interred in the dungeons.
Rackets was played on what they called the Master's side by criminals with a bob
or two, who could even, if they chose, live outside the prison walls. Outmates,
you could say, and public schoolboys all, no doubt. The prison closed in 1848
and the rackets court became rubble too and sometime thereafter there was a new
branch in the family tree called squash and we all played that instead. Well,
those of us from down the hill.

Male would be the first to admit that the pond he inhabits is not a large one.
He makes no pretence. 'Public school game,' he says. In tacit acknowledgment
that there is more to sport than rackets, Male has embarked on a number of other
sporting careers during his 11-year tenure as world champion. With the Atlanta
Braves in 1994, he turned his hand to baseball. 'The owner of the club - it was
before Ted Turner bought it - saw me at the New York rackets club and invited me
down,' relates Male. The rackets star acquitted himself well enough and
estimates that, had he been 22 rather than 29, the story could have been written
differently. In August of that year, though, the strike broke and the Braves'
first concern was not to enlist an unknown Briton. Male and Michael Jordan both
went back to what they did best.

In 1996, Male went professional as a real tennis player where the competition is
hotter than rackets and princesses-to-be are press officers. Sponsorship came
from Societe Generale, the asset management company (Male describes himself as a
private investor in the stock exchange) and the objective was to become the
first player in history to hold the rackets and real tennis world titles
concurrently.

Real tennis has the same cornerstone as tennis; grand slams in Australia,
France, Britain and the United States. You must win one to qualify as a
challenger for the world championship. This round, there is only the American
title left, in February. Should Male fail to win that event, he will not qualify
for the play-off and there will be no double title and, at 34, a limited number
of years left to try.

Male has already fixed his gaze at another sport. He plays golf off a six or
seven handicap and sounds like he is straining at the leash to bring it down a
few shots. For the moment it must wait though.

Rackets carries the birthmark of elitism, but diminish the skills at your peril.
'They usually say it's like playing squash with a golf ball,' says Male and it
is decidedly not a game for those short in hand-eye co-ordination. It may not be
as quick as pelota, but then most of the time you are a lot nearer the walls in
rackets.

Everyone knows everyone else in the game and Male meets a well-known adversary
in Neil Smith, whom he beat for the title in 1995 (the last time the challenge
was fought) and in 1993 (the time before). In 1991, for a change, he defeated
Shannon Hazell, another Brit. Since Male's first win, in 1988, he has defended
the title only on those three occasions. This is his fourth.

The game is played only in England and America (where you could probably
substitute Ivy League for public school) and the two-leg final kicked off two
days ago at the Chicago Rackets Club. They sold out in Chicago, but as there are
only 130 spectator seats at the club, it didn't signify a breakthrough to the
big-time. The score came too late for this column, but we boldly predict the
predictable. Male to win comfortably overall and hang on to his title for
another few years, while in his mind's eye he is lining up a putt at the last to
win The Open at Carnoustie . . .

Pulling strings for the sport

BYLINE: NANCY MORGAN

SECTION: LARGO-SEMINOLE TIMES; TENNIS; Pg. 4

LENGTH: 723 words

DATELINE: CLEARWATER



For more than 20 years, the Advantage Yours Tennis Shoppe here has served  area
players, and last weekend it joined another effort to benefit players  from the
novice  to the highly advanced.

Advantage Yours was a testing site for the U.S. Racquet Stringers  Association
and its recently developed Certified Racquet Technician program.  Kim Cashman,
whose mother, Peg Rogers, owns the Clearwater store, tested about  12
USRSA-certified stringers from Pinellas, Hillsborough and Manatee counties.
There are just two other areas in Florida that serve as test sites - Miami and
Pensacola.

One of the primary aims of the CRT program is to improve a stringer's  ability
to know a racquet from tip to grip, according to USRSA associate  director Don
Hightower of Del Mar, Calif. The CRT program is more  comprehensive than the
original racquet stringer program the USRSA began in  1986, he said, with the
goal to reduce racquet warranty returns due to poor  stringing.

Along with Advantage Yours' leadership in racquet knowledge is its  commitment
to junior development. Volunteer work extends from free racquet  stringing for
the U.S. Tennis Association Schools Program to financial support  of the North
Pinellas Area Junior Team Tennis League for 150 players.

"I originally got into this business because of the interest of our  girls,"
said Rogers, a pharmacist for 20 years. "Both Kim and her older  sister Kathy
played tennis for Clearwater High and then attended college on  scholarships. If
there's anything we can do for the kids, we're game."

Willie Schuette, tennis professional for the City of Clearwater, feels
comfortable and confident in approaching Rogers for assistance, either
equipment or financial, in promoting junior development.

"Peg is particularly interested in municipal tennis - that's where her  girls
learned - but wants to see everybody succeed, either from the public  courts or
the country club," Schuette said.

Tennis' loss: Tennis lost a long-time supporter with the death of Louis  Presti
this month. Presti, 76, was a teaching professional and was a figure in
Pinellas tennis for more than 30 years. His unheralded involvement in junior
tennis included providing equipment for the U.S. Tennis Association Schools
Program, assisting players in acquiring college scholarships, racquet  stringing
for high school players, and providing shoes, racquets and lessons  for
participants at Clearwater's Martin Luther King Recreation Center.

Presti owned the Presti Tennis Center in Clearwater.

District meeting: A District 12 tennis meeting is Saturday at East Lake
Woodlands Country Club in Palm Harbor. Members of the district committee as
well as all tennis enthusiasts in the Pinellas-Pasco area are invited to the
tennis snack bar area for the noon-2 p.m. meeting. For more information, call
796-5559.

Summer upsets: Sydnie Zillig and Reinaldo Valor of Clearwater and Dabney  Mercer
from Seminole Lake Racquet Club - all seeded No. 2 in their respective  age
divisions - upset top seeds in the Summer Championships at Seminole Lake
Racquet Club last weekend. Zillig (girls 12), Valor (boys 12) and Mercer  (girls
16) each defeated their final opponents in three sets.

Michael Murray of Clearwater was the only No. 1-seeded player to win his  title.
He defeated Parker Collins of Seminole Lake 6-1, 6-1. Third seed Steven
Capriati of Wesley Chapel, brother of Jennifer Capriati, upset top seed Mike
Delfierro of Bradenton in straight sets in the boys 16 final.

Saab nationals: Twelve doubles teams qualified for this weekend's First  Annual
Saab World Tennis Championships in Ponte Vedra near Jacksonville.  Qualifying in
the men's A division are Mark Wagner and partner Scott Spoerl,  and Jim
Smiechewicz and Charles Wenglasz. B division qualifiers are Bill  Simmers and
Terry Rodenhaver along with the father-son team of Adrian and  Alberto Pagani.
The C division is represented by Joe McIntyre and Dave Young,  and Skip Rath and
Eric Bredal.

Qualifying in the women's A division were Judy Esteppe and Betsy Slate, and  Sue
Delie and Bonnie Resmondo. In the B division are Janice McIntyre and  Harold
Warford, and Susan Simon and Trish Mainard. In C are Becky Clamp and  Ruth Hepp,
and Lisa Smiechewicz and Pam Pagano.

About New York;
Old King Pong May Be Down, But Not Out

MARTY REISMAN hunkered down and inspected the table tennis net. Wearing a purple
shirt, red pants and a Panama hat, he looked like a retiree going to the deli
for a nosh. But the $100 bill he held in his hand made it clear he wasn't about
to retire anywhere. He folded the bill and held it against the net to check its
height. It had to be exact.

The old man with the C-note was about to risk losing 100 of them in a
high-stakes table-tennis match in Hell's Kitchen on Saturday night. Scores of
spectators lined up two rows deep to watch Mr. Reisman, 68, play Jimmy Butler, a
table-tennis champ in his 20's, in a $10,000 challenge match. Mr. Reisman, a
legendary player who has held 18 national and international titles, wanted to
prove that the hard-rubber racquet he grew up with was superior to the spongy
racquets that now dominate the sport. He was unshakable in his belief that he
could beat "the kid" if both of them used the old-style racquets that emphasized
skill rather than the sponge racquets that provide Ping-Pong pyrotechnics.

Saturday night's battle was a grudge match, and not just because he had lost
$5,000 to Mr. Butler a few months before. He has carried a grudge against the
sponge racquet since the 1952 world championship, when a Japanese player first
trotted out the new racquet to beat him with razzle-dazzle.

"The match against Jimmy is the culmination, the peak game of all the bitter
feelings that accumulated in me over the years," he said in a rapid, gravelly
voice. "To have the rug ripped out from under me was a very frustrating
experience, to be reduced and swamped by a racquet."

There is a bit of drama in this, which is typical. Mr. Reisman is known for
bringing excitement to the game that he learned to play on the Lower East Side.
He discovered he had a natural gift, which came in handy at first by earning him
dimes and quarters. Later, the money got serious, as did he. He estimates that
he has circled the globe three times in search of games.

He and his partner, Doug Cartland, played at halftime for the Harlem
Globetrotters. They used frying pans as racquets and beat out "Mary Had a Little
Lamb" as they traded shots. The musicians' union objected and forced them to
stop.

Mr. Reisman hates the sponge racquets. The hard rubber ones, he said, are an
extension of a player's skill. The sponge racquets give a mechanical advantage
that allows slow players to slam and spin the ball.

"Before, there was a dialogue between two players, wherein a 6-year-old child
could understand the dialogue between offense and defense," he said. "Today a
point is made or lost with an imperceptible twist of the wrist. For the most
part, 90 percent of the time the game is ridiculous and 10 percent it's sublime
because they can do some incredible things with the sponge. Sometimes."

FOR Saturday night's match, Mr. Butler spotted Mr. Reisman 4 points in each
21-point game. Mr. Butler also agreed not to hide the ball or stamp the floor
during his serves, common ploys in today's game. But while the serves were
silent, Mr. Reisman was not. Soon into the match, he grew irritated at some
spectators who clapped when he missed a shot.

"Let's not have any hysterics," he scolded. "It's unwarranted. It's a normal
shot to me."

When Mr. Butler missed and the crowd reluctantly clapped, Mr. Reisman nodded.
He kept up the patter during the match, apologizing to Mr. Butler when he scored
a point. Other times, he stole a few seconds to recover his breath by pretending
to be in a fog while looking for the ball. Between games, his wife, Yoshiko,
acted like a cut man in his corner, patting down his face and arms and adjusting
his pants cuffs.

"Drink," his friends urged him from the sidelines. "Concentrate. Breathe."

The game resumed, as Mr. Butler slammed a volley of orange blurs toward Mr.
Reisman. He deftly returned them in a slow, graceful arc. But it was not enough.
He lost the match in the fifth game of the third seven-game set.

Afterward, he was $10,000 poorer but still surrounded by friends. "You played a
nice game," one said. "Take a little water. You're a little cold."

"Nah," Mr. Reisman replied. "I'm ready to go again."

"This isn't sex," another friend said.

"I'm not finished," Mr. Reisman insisted. "I'm coming back here. One way or
another, I'm coming back."

Local seniors are into racket sports

BYLINE: Jim Rueda, The Free Press, Mankato, Minn.

SECTION: SPORTS

LENGTH: 531 words


July 09--MANKATO -- Betsy and Earle Peters never set out to be crusaders, it's
just kind of turned out that way.

The longtime residents, who raised two children in Mankato, are into everything
that involves a racket. If it's a tennis match, they're there; If it's
racquetball, Earle is probably not too far away. And, more recently, the
husband-wife duo has gotten into pickleball.

Betsy is 67 and Earle is 72. Their passion for everything rackets started out as
just that -- a way to have fun together and exercise.

As they've gotten older, however, they've realized how important it is for
seniors to stay active. Now they don't just participate, they also advocate.

"We're big advocates for senior recreation," Earle said. "Your quality of life
is so much better when you are out doing things."

Betsy agrees: "People are living longer so it's important to stay healthy. We
can't do what we did when we were 35, but we can still move around and exercise
and have fun doing it."

Earle is a retired pharmacist in Mankato who is also an assistant coach with the
East High School boys tennis program. Betsy had never played tennis before she
met her husband-to-be in the late 1960s, but she picked it up in earnest around
10 years ago when the kids grew up and left home.

The local pickelball movement began about three years ago. Sandy Buckley and
John Sandry were also advocates at the time and the foursome, along with others,
began spreading the word and drumming up support for the sport.

A year ago the Mankato Area Pickleball Association was formed with Buckley as
president. A few months ago the association went before the Mankato City Council
and lobbied to turn the seldom-used Tourtellotte tennis courts into a pickleball
facility. The council approved the plan.

"I think that was real win-win for everybody," Earle said. "The city had this
facility that really wasn't being used, and now pickleball players have a place
to play they can call their own. We'll be able to fit six courts on the site and
the hope is to host some tournaments in the near future."

Last month, the two Peters, Buckley and Sandry went south to compete in the Iowa
Senior Games in West Des Moines. The came back with a handful of age-group
championships and top-three finishes in tennis, racquetball and pickleball.

"That was our goal," Earle said. "The top three finishers in each state's Senior
Games in 2014 qualify for next year's National Senior Games to be held in
Minneapolis and St. Paul. That's something we think would be fun to do."

The National Senior Games typically draws more than 12,000 athletes for the
two-week event.

Betsy stresses that it's not just the Peters involved in all these endeavors.
She says there are pockets of seniors doing different things everywhere. There's
even a group that meets three times a week up at Bethel Baptist Church in
Mankato to play table tennis.

"It's really not about how well you play whatever game you're playing," Betsy
said. "It's about just getting out there and doing it. The socializing is a lot
of fun, too."

Profile of change // Sales of new Wilson racket herald a move toward wider
frames

BYLINE: DARRELL FRY

SECTION: HERNANDO TIMES; tennis; Pg. 4

LENGTH: 753 words

DATELINE: ST. PETERSBURG



ST. PETERSBURG - Tennis underwent a revolution in the early 1970s:    Metal
rackets replaced the traditional wood frames. Later in the    decade, technology
brought the oversized racket.

     Tennis rackets are taking on a new shape again.

     The Wilson Profile, a wide-frame racket, is so popular that many in    the
tennis industry predict it will change the business.

     "All the other (manufacturers) are copying it. They saw what was    going
on and are reacting to it," said Mike Barrett, tennis pro at    Nevada Bob's
Golf and Tennis Shop, in Tampa. "The Profile has put all    racket technology in
question. It's that unique."

     Donnay, Wimbledon and Pro Kennex have wide-frame rackets on the    market;
Prince, Yamaha and Head are expected to introduce versions this    year. But the
Wilson Profile has a unique feel, tennis pros say.

     Pros and manufacturers discussing the "width" of a tennis racket
actually are referring to its thickness. The hollow Profile frame,    designed
by a German inventor and patented by Wilson, is 1 1/2 inches    at its thickest
point - almost twice as thick as a conventional racket    frame, and thicker
than other wide-frame rackets.

     The extremely stiff Profile frame causes the racket to flex with    the
ball, not after the ball leaves the strings. The result, Wilson
representatives claim, is increased power and control. Wilson also says    the
extra thickness absorbs vibration, making the racket easy on the    arm and
elbow.

     In a recent World Tennis test, the Profile, made of graphite and
fiberglass, tied the magazine's testing record for "playability" and    scored
the highest combined total for power and playability.

     Power with control? Stiff but easy on the arm? Thick but light?

 Those traits are a lot to ask of a racket, but the Profile already has    a
reputation for delivering.

     "I was a 3.0 player, but with the Profile I'm a 4.0 player," said    Peg
Rogers, who owns Advantage Yours Tennis, in Clearwater. "It makes    me better
without practicing."

     "It's the best racket on the market," said Gene Metcalf of    Suncoast
Sports Unlimited, in Largo. "You're probably going to    over-hit on your
groundstrokes until you get used to it."

     Getting used to the Profile is no problem. Getting a Profile can    be.
According to Kathy Button, Wilson's director of public relations,    the company
did not produce many rackets initially.

     "We just wanted to get them out," she said. "It was a big    chance,
because it's kind of wide and big. When it's new technology, it    doesn't
always work."

     This time it has. Consumers reportedly are buying the racket as    fast as
the small shipments hit the stores - despite the suggested    retail price of $
225.

     Button said the racket, without any advertising, "is doing so well    it's
scary. We can't make them fast enough."

     Locally, the racket can be found only in tennis shops. "We've got    six
coming in next month, and they'll be gone in a heartbeat," said    Joe Majer, an
employee at Suncoast Sports Unlimited.

     The demand has forced many shops to create a waiting list. Mason    Tennis
Mart of New York City has a list of 30 to 40 names. "The few    rackets we get
will sell out in two days," an employee said.

     At Nevada Bob's, there is a waiting list of 25. "We got five    rackets in
and we sold them all immediately," Barrett said.

     Button said Wilson is manufacturing more rackets in an effort to    satisfy
the demand. No one on the pro tour uses the racket, because    Wilson has not
promoted it with players and "because we haven't been    able to get a player 12
rackets," Button said, referring to the large    number of rackets that pros
usually require.

     To complement the Profile, Wilson is developing a special string:    "ET
synthetic gut." The string is said to reduce abrasion and thus    last longer.

     Despite the early stream of favorable reviews, Wilson is not    promising
that everyone will like the racket. Some people will either    be turned off by
its price tag or its stiff feel. As Rogers of    Advantage Yours said: "Everyone
has their favorites "

Playoffs expected to generate thunderous racquet

BYLINE: Doug Smith

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 8C

LENGTH: 490 words


The month-long TEAMTENNIS season ends next week with the San Antonio Racquets
and Atlanta Thunder assured of berths in next Thursday's division playoff final.

The Racquets (11-0), led by Sammy Giammalva, clinched the Western Division
regular-season title Saturday; the Thunder (9-2), led by MVP candidate Martina
Navratilova, nailed down the Eastern title Sunday.

The top three teams in each division advance to the playoffs, with the Racquets
and Thunder receiving byes while the No. 2 and No. 3 teams meet Tuesday in
division semifinals.

The Los Angeles Strings (6-4), led by Rookie of the Year candidate Jimmy
Connors, are among the teams challenging the Racquets in the West. The Raleigh
Edge are the top challenger in the East.

The Racquets and Thunder host the semifinal winners Thursday. The championship
match is Aug. 10.

 RELIEF FROM GRAFS: Jim Levee, a fan of No. 1 ranked Monica Seles, was granted a
second temporary restraining order against Steffi Graf's father, Peter, and
brother, Michael, in a California court Tuesday.

Levee, 52, a wealthy Floridian who formerly helped sponsor Graf, claims Peter
Graf struck him during the French Open, and Michael threatened him at Wimbledon.
He sought injunctive relief for himself and friend Jill Jensen, 39, from the
Grafs ''harassing annoying or assaulting'' them.

''This is no way a reflection against Steffi,'' Levee said, ''but Jill and I
won't allow ourselves to be a punching bag.''

 STICH MOVES UP: Wimbledon champion Michael Stich moved to No. 3 in the computer
rankings. He replaces Ivan Lendl, who dropped to No. 4 and out of the top three
for the first time since August 1982. Stich, 22, of Germany, also is the tour's
leading money-winner with $ 1,021,081. ... The USTA Player Development Program
headquarters will move from Princeton, N.J., to Key Biscayne, Fla., possibly
early next year. Fans donating a used tennis racquet or new can of balls to the
International Tennis Hall of Fame will receive two complimentary tickets for the
Prudential Securities Grand Champions, Aug. 22- 25 at Newport, R.I.

 PLAYING DOUBLES: Twin girls, not identical, were born to Lendl, 31, and his
wife, Samantha, Monday at Greenwich (Conn.) Hospital. Isabelle Anita, Caroline
Elizabeth and mother are doing well, a spokeswoman said. The Lendls also also
have a 14-month-old daughter, Marika. ... Stanford's Sandra Birch and Georgia's
Al Parker lead the Volvo Tennis/Scholar Athlete Team. Birch, the 1989 and 1991
NCAA singles champion, graduated with a 3.8 grade-point average and a degree in
economics. Parker, a four-time All-American, is a finance major with a 4.0 GPA.
''Both had the option of coming out of high school to turn professional,'' said
David A. Benjamin, director of the Intercollegiate Tennis Coaches Association.
''But both opted to pursue an education while continuing their tennis careers.''

Sales of new racket herald a move toward wider frames

DATELINE: ST. PETERSBURG



ST. PETERSBURG - Tennis underwent a revolution in the early 1970s:    Metal
rackets replaced the traditional wood frames. Later in the    decade, technology
brought the oversized racket.

     Tennis rackets are taking on a new shape again.

     The Wilson Profile, a wide-frame racket, is so popular that many in    the
tennis industry predict it will change the business.

     "All the other (manufacturers) are copying it. They saw what was    going
on and are reacting to it," said Mike Barrett, tennis pro at    Nevada Bob's
Golf and Tennis Shop, in Tampa. "The Profile has put all    racket technology in
question. It's that unique."

     Donnay, Wimbledon and Pro Kennex have wide-frame rackets on the    market;
Prince, Yamaha and Head are expected to introduce versions this    year. But the
Wilson Profile has a unique feel, tennis pros say.

     Pros and manufacturers discussing the "width" of a tennis racket
actually are referring to its thickness. The hollow Profile frame,    designed
by a German inventor and patented by Wilson, is 1 1/2 inches    at its thickest
point - almost twice as thick as a conventional racket    frame, and thicker
than other wide-frame rackets.

     The extremely stiff Profile frame causes the racket to flex with    the
ball, not after the ball leaves the strings. The result, Wilson
representatives claim, is increased power and control. Wilson also says    the
extra thickness absorbs vibration, making the racket easy on the    arm and
elbow.

     In a recent World Tennis test, the Profile, made of graphite and
fiberglass, tied the magazine's testing record for "playability" and    scored
the highest combined total for power and playability.

     Power with control? Stiff but easy on the arm? Thick but light?

 Those traits are a lot to ask of a racket, but the Profile already has    a
reputation for delivering.

     "I was a 3.0 player, but with the Profile I'm a 4.0 player," said    Peg
Rogers, who owns Advantage Yours Tennis, in Clearwater. "It makes    me better
without practicing."

     "It's the best racket on the market," said Gene Metcalf of    Suncoast
Sports Unlimited, in Largo. "You're probably going to    over-hit on your
groundstrokes until you get used to it."

     Getting used to the Profile is no problem. Getting a Profile can    be.
According to Kathy Button, Wilson's director of public relations,    the company
did not produce many rackets initially.

     "We just wanted to get them out," she said. "It was a big    chance,
because it's kind of wide and big. When it's new technology, it    doesn't
always work."

     This time it has. Consumers reportedly are buying the racket as    fast as
the small shipments hit the stores - despite the suggested    retail price of $
225.

     Button said the racket, without any advertising, "is doing so well    it's
scary. We can't make them fast enough."

     Locally, the racket can be found only in tennis shops. "We've got    six
coming in next month, and they'll be gone in a heartbeat," said    Joe Majer, an
employee at Suncoast Sports Unlimited.

     The demand has forced many shops to create a waiting list. Mason    Tennis
Mart of New York City has a list of 30 to 40 names. "The few    rackets we get
will sell out in two days," an employee said.

     At Nevada Bob's, there is a waiting list of 25. "We got five    rackets in
and we sold them all immediately," Barrett said.

     Button said Wilson is manufacturing more rackets in an effort to    satisfy
the demand. No one on the pro tour uses the racket, because    Wilson has not
promoted it with players and "because we haven't been    able to get a player 12
rackets," Button said, referring to the large    number of rackets that pros
usually require.

     To complement the Profile, Wilson is developing a special string:    "ET
synthetic gut." The string is said to reduce abrasion and thus    last longer.

     Despite the early stream of favorable reviews, Wilson is not    promising
that everyone will like the racket. Some people will either    be turned off by
its price tag or its stiff feel. As Rogers of    Advantage Yours said: "Everyone
has their favorites "

Spaghetti-Racquet Ban Is Upheld by Court

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS, Dec. 7


A Federal appeals court has upheld the United States Tennis Association's ban on
the so-called spaghetti racquet. The racquet is of normal size but is
double-strung with 10 main strings and five cross-strings.

The association argued that a player using the racquet could put 30 to 60
percent more spin on the ball and that the spin also was unpredictable. It said
the racquet could change the basic nature of the game. Gunter Harz Sports Inc.
had filed an antitrust suit challenging the U.S.T.A.'s authority to ban the
racquet.

PS Racquet creditor wants stay relief

BYLINE: by Kevin Fung

SECTION: BANKRUPTCY

LENGTH: 445 words



HIGHLIGHT: Vineyard Bank seeks approval so it can continue with a foreclosure on
the real estate company.


A creditor of bankrupt PS Racquet Club Properties LLC is seeking relief from
stay so that it can continue with a foreclosure action.

At a hearing scheduled for March 3 in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Central
District of California in Los Angeles, prepetition lender Vineyard Bank NA of
Corona, Calif., will seek approval from Judge Sheri Bluebond for the motion that
would allow it to proceed with a foreclosure sale that was stayed by the
debtor's Chapter 11 filing in late October.

Palm Springs, Calif.-based PS Racquet Club Properties, a real estate development
company whose main operations consist of the restoration of an historic property
called the Racquet Club of Palm Springs, filed for Chapter 11 protection on Oct.
28, two days before the scheduled foreclosure sale. It listed assets of $42.6
million and liabilities of $15.2 million in its petition.

Vineyard Bank provided prepetition funding in the total amount of $15.18
million, of which $12.475 million had been funded, court papers show.

Vineyard stopped permitting draws against the loan in September when it failed
to come to an agreement with the debtor's principals regarding an extension to
the maturity date. The loan was declared to be in default, and the foreclosure
sale was scheduled for Oct. 30.

The Racquet Club of Palm Springs was originally founded in 1932 by Hollywood
actors Ralph Bellamy and Charlie Farrell, when they bought 200 acres of land and
built two tennis courts, court filings show. They sent invitations to their
Hollywood friends, and over the next several years, membership grew, and they
added a swimming pool and the Bamboo Lounge, a dance club, to the property.

Since 2006 PS Racquet Club Properties has been responsible for restoring a
10-acre section of the property, which will include the renovation of existing
structures as well as the construction of new residential townhouses.

PS Racquet Club Properties plans to use the bankruptcy stay to find financing to
complete the development of the Palm Springs property and then sell it so the
proceeds could be used to pay back all secured and unsecured debt. The debtor
plans to file a disclosure statement and reorganization plan before the end of
February.

The company estimates that it can complete the renovation and construction
within a year and with about $19 million in additional financing. It also
estimates that once complete, the project will be worth about $42.5 million.

The sole secured creditor is Vineyard Bank, which is owed about $12.48 million.

The largest unsecured claim is held by Mueller Design Inc. of Los Angeles, worth
$560,680.

Debtor counsel is independent practitioner Carolyn Dye of Los Angeles.

What a racket // Jack Kramer comes out with a new model

BYLINE: SUSAN BIDDLE JAFFE

SECTION: SPORTS; Tennis; Pg. 7C

LENGTH: 874 words

DATELINE: ST. PETERSBURG



ST. PETERSBURG - Jack Kramer autographed his first Wilson racquet 38    years
ago.

     Between 1949, when the Jack Kramer Autograph was first introduced,    and
1981 when it was discontinued, more than 10 million were sold. In    autograph
sports equipment, only the Ted Williams baseball glove has    outsold the racket
which for most of America became the standard by    which all wood rackets were
judged.

     After a six-year absence from the shelves and what seems like light
years of technical advances in the field of racket production, Jack    Kramer
has returned with a new graphite-fiberglass version of the    original named the
Kramer Staff.

     Under contract to Wilson until 1994, Kramer is at the Suncoast    today to
introduce the "second generation" Kramer racket to Wilson    field advisors in
the morning and to lead a public demonstration in the    afternoon at
Countryside Country Club in Clearwater.

     The beauty of the new Kramer, according to the man for whom it's    named,
is that it has the feel and playability of the original.

     "I used the same racket only slightly heavier," said Kramer of    the
original. "But the beauty of it was that it seemed to fit    everybody's game.
Men could play with it, women could play with it and    the real tough guys
could play with it.

     "The reason I selected the new racket from the the ones Wilson    offered
me is that it did what my original racket did, get good control    yet get some
speed. I decided that this racket would be good for the    heavy hitter as well
as the people who want more control."

     And though Kramer's on the road once again promoting the racket -    the
Times caught up with him by phone in Atlanta on Tuesday - the    tennis Hall of
Famer credits the success of the original racket not so    much to his talent as
a player but to Wilson and lady luck.

     "A lot of the people who stay around for a long time have a lot of    good
fortune on their side and I've been extremely fortunate," Kramer    said. Adding
to the success of his racket he believes was his reign as    pro champion for
seven years, which allowed his name to sneak ahead of    the pack.

     Kramer's success, coupled with the growing market that allowed    Wilson to
put more dollars into marketing, is what put the original    racket over the top
and allowed it to stay there for 32 years, he said.

     Returning to the marketplace wasn't, however, a sure bet for the    tennis
legend, who holds the distinction of being the youngest player    ever to
represent the United States in a Davis Cup challenge round.

     "Wilson was not sure that Jack Kramer as a name, or as a person    who had
been away from the tennis court scene, would carry anything at    all with the
public," Kramer said.

     Kramer's personal belief in both the racket and his own    marketability
was proven when the racket hit test markets in the spring    of last year.
"The people who buy the rackets, who want to sell it to make a    profit, wanted
every one they could get," he said.

     Kramer said that future sales won't be generated by his name as    much as
by the racket itself, once players at all levels begin playing    with it.

        But even more surprising to Kramer than the success his rackets    have
enjoyed at all levels of play - the Kramer Autograph was played    by 15 pros
including Tony Trabert, Arthur Ashe, Tracy Austin, John    McEnroe and Chris
Evert Lloyd - has been the growth of the sport in    general.

     "I always knew we had a sensational game to offer to those who    played it
but I never thought as many people would," Kramer said.



 In national tournaments...





   U.S Indoor: Sweden's Stefan Edberg, the No. 2 ranked player in the    world,
held off determined college student Richey Reneberg to take a    7-6, 2-6, 6-4
victory Tuesday night at the $ 315,000 U.S. Indoor Tennis    Championships in
Memphis, Tenn. Edberg, the tournament's No. 1 seed,    won the first set on a
7-5 tiebreaker before Reneberg, a junior at SMU    and an ranked 340th
internationally, took the second set.

     Earlier, unseeded Ulf Stenlund of Sweden collected seven straight    points
in a tiebreaker in an upset of No. 8 seed Anders Jarryd, also of    Sweden.

 No. 4 seed Brad Gilbert moved to the third round with a 6-1, 6-3    defeat of
John Sadri. Unseeded Greg Holmes staged a second-round upset    with a 6-4, 3-6,
6-2 victory over No. 12 seed Aaron Krickstein.

     California Slims: Stephanie Rehe and Melissa Gurney, a pair of
17-year-old Californians, got off to winning starts in the first round    of the
$ 150,000 Virginia Slims event in San Francisco. Eighth-seeded    Rehe beat Kate
Gompert 3-6, 6-3, 6-3 and unseeded Gurney downed Anne    White 6-2, 6-1 in
first-round matches. Top-seeded Hana Mandlikova plays    her first match
tonight.

Standard sports can still generate attention from inventors.

In the last week alone, patents have been approved for a new baseball, football,
golf ball, tennis racquet and boomerang.

Michael B. Maynard, an amateur tennis player in Portland, Ore., has invented an
air-cushioned racquet that he says will reduce vibration and widen the effective
hitting area - the so-called sweet spot.

An inflatable inner tube is built into the racquet's head. The tube lies between
an interior frame, to which the strings are attached, and an exterior frame,
which forms a concentric circle around it. When inflated, the tube forms a tight
seal between the two sections and absorbs vibrations transmitted from the
strings, Mr. Maynard said.

He said his main purpose was to reduce ''tennis elbow.'' In addition, however,
he said the racquet had turned out to have a larger sweet spot, although he was
not sure why.

The International Lawn Tennis Association has approved the racquet for use in
competition, but early users complained about its poor weight distribution and
balance. The Maynard Racquet Corporation is starting to market an improved model
for about $150.

Mr. Maynard received patent 4,772,021.

RACKET REPAIR IS A SPECIALTY FOR TROY MAN;
HIS EXPERTISE IS IN STRINGING, MENDING RACQUETBALL RACKETS

BYLINE: Steve Horrell; Special To The Post-Dispatch

SECTION: ALTON AREA POST, Pg. 4

LENGTH: 703 words

DATELINE: TROY


Early in Ted Williams' career, baseball legend has it that a bat company
official laid six nearly identical baseball bats before the Red Sox slugger and
challenged him to pick out the one, blindfolded, that was half an ounce heavier.
Williams did it, twice in a row.

That's the sort of thing Ralph Kusche could relate to. He is the lone employee
of Ralph's Racquets, a business he runs from his home in Troy.

He's an expert with tennis and racquetball rackets, a certified racket
technician who can calibrate the desired tension on a broken racket and mend it
for you in minutes.

Kusche doesn't sleep with rackets in the way Williams slept with his favorite
bats, but he's every bit as passionate about equipment.

Certified racket technicians not only string rackets - racquetball rackets,
tennis rackets, and, less frequently, badminton and squash rackets - they have
also studied racket technology and design enough to help players match their
playing level and style with the right racket.

Every so often, when they need someone to test their latest model, the marketing
department at Wilson, a nationally-known racquetball racket maker, seeks Kusche
out for his advice. For a few weeks, Kusche gets to play with it. Then he gives
them his insights about things such as string tension and feel. But it's
stringing he likes best and if someday his client base grows enough, he may quit
his telecommunications job at Bridge Information Systems in St. Louis and run
Ralph's Racquets full time.

"I do that mostly because I have to," he says of his day job, "and I do this
because I'm passionate about it." Ralph's Racquets is actually a small carpeted
room off the living room of his home in the west part of Troy. He begins mending
a racquetball racket by clamping the frame into place and placing the free end
of the nylon string into the grip of a rectangular machine called an electronic
tensioner, which measures string tension. The machine cost him $ 800 - $ 650
more than an ordinary string tension machine, but it's worth it: when it comes
to calibrations, it's virtually never off.

He got started in the business in 1991, after he found himself breaking his own
strings every two weeks. Now he strings two or three racquetball rackets a week
and as many as 30 tennis rackets a week during the high-school season. He
derives more satisfaction by doing racquetball rackets, since those players have
long had to entrust their rackets and their luck to people who make their living
with tennis.

"There are very few people that know how to do racquetball right," he maintains.
"The nature of the game is different from tennis and you can't just take what
works for tennis and apply it to racquetball. If you want to learn how to fix
cars, somebody can show you how to fix your car, but that doesn't mean you're
necessarily going to be able to go out and fix somebody's Cadillac."

Kusche draws clients from Madison and St. Clair counties. Most of his referrals
come from Scott Air Force Base, the YMCAs in Edwardsville and Granite City, the
Nautilus Fitness and Racquet Club in Alton, the Belleville Health and Sports
Center, and area high schools. In the fall of 1995, when ESPN2 needed something
to promote pro racquetball, its camera crews came to Troy and filmed Kusche
doing his thing. The spot aired for less than a minute, but it landed him two
unexpected clients: five-time world-champion Cliff Swain and two-time national
amateur champ, Andy Roberts. Kusche travels to the Chicago area for tournaments
and often strings 30 and 55 rackets from Friday night to Sunday afternoon.

Kusche advertises his services by leaving a calling card and brochure near the
indoor racquetball courts, and every so often he drives there to pick up rackets
that are waiting to be strung. To pick up, fix, and return, he charges about $
20 a racket. Those dropped off at his home are a few dollars less. Most rackets
take from 15 to 18 minutes to string. "I've done 'em in nine-and-a-half," he
adds.

Each stringing is a work of art that Kusche finishes off with his own
distinctive knot.

"It's like my little signature in the world," he says. "I know that I strung my
racquet if I see my knot."

Howard Head, the inventor of the Head metal ski and the Prince tennis racket,
died on Sunday at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. He was 76 years old and
lived in Baltimore and Vail, Colo.

He died of complications after heart surgery, a family spokesman said.

Mr. Head, a native of Philadelphia, graduated from Harvard in 1936 with a degee
in engineering sciences. He moved to Baltimore in the early 1940's and went to
work as an aircraft engineer for the Glenn L. Martin Company, which designed and
built planes during World War II.

When he first skied in 1947, he was frustrated by his heavy wooden skis and
became convinced that he could build a better ski out of lightweight aircraft
materials.

The following year he formed the Head Ski Company and developed the aluminum
sandwich ski. Head skis began winning wide public acceptance, and the skiers
using them won medals -- the first at the 1964 Winter Olympics.

Broader Tennis Racket

In 1971 he sold the company to AMF and took up a new pursuit, tennis, and the
quest for a better tennis racket. The result was a patent for a broader racket.
With four times the effective hitting surface of traditional rackets, the new
design soon proved popular.

Mr. Head retired again in 1982 when he sold Prince Manufacturing to Chesebrough
Pond's.

He was noted in recent years for his philanthropy. Center Stage in Baltimore
recently dedicated the Head Theater, named for the inventor and his wife,
Martha, as a tribute to their many years of support.

Besides his wife, Mr. Head is survived by a daughter, Nancy Thode of Greenwich,
Conn; a sister, Jean Cooper of Boerne, Tex.; three stepdaughters, Lynn Fritzlen
of Vail, Guerin Olsen of Darien, Conn, and Marla Croke of Telluride, Colo., and

Mr. Head retired again in 1982 when he sold Prince Manufacturing to Chesebrough
Pond's.

He was noted in recent years for his philanthropy. Center Stage in Baltimore
recently dedicated the Head Theater, named for the inventor and his wife,
Martha, as a tribute to their many years of support.

Besides his wife, Mr. Head is survived by a daughter, Nancy Thode of Greenwich,
Conn; a sister, Jean Cooper of Boerne, Tex.; three stepdaughters, Lynn Fritzlen
of Vail, Guerin Olsen of Darien, Conn, and Marla Croke of Telluride, Colo., and

Stars' Rackets: Not Just Like Ours

BYLINE: By STUART MILLER

SECTION: Section F; Column 0; Sports Desk; Pg. 6

LENGTH: 815 words


When Roger Federer decided to switch to a larger racket, it was tennis's most
buzzed-about change since Jimmy Connors flashed his neon yellow Estusa at the
1991 United States Open.

After months of hands-on tinkering by Federer, the Wilson Pro Staff RF 97
Autograph was revealed at Wimbledon, where he reached the final.

The new model harks back to the Jack Kramer Autograph, the best-selling model
for decades during the wooden-racket era. Wilson, though, says it is offering
more than a racket with Federer's signature on it.

''We want to be clear this is his actual racket, not a 'signature racket' or '
racket of choice,' '' said John Lyons, Wilson's global product director,
referring to the many rackets sponsored by top players with vague phrases like
the one put forth by the tennis company Head: ''Andy Murray's racket of
choice.''

On Head's website, the fine print for each player's racket, like Murray's or
Novak Djokovic's, says, ''Head Pro players may play with different rackets from
the model shown.''

A Head spokeswoman, Allison Barnett, declined to discuss details, writing in an
email, ''Out of respect to these professionals, we are not comfortable providing
any further information about their rackets.''

Federer said the racket coming to stores in October was ''the one I'm playing
with.''

But amateur tennis players have often been skeptical of such claims. Online
forums of tennis aficionados are filled with complaints that the pros really use
older models or even different ones repainted to look like their sponsor's
latest product, an issue that has plagued the racket industry for years. Many
people thought that Connors's famous Estusa was a repainted Slazenger Phantom.

''I don't know how prevalent that is these days,'' said Paul Annacone, a former
player and coach and now an analyst for the Tennis Channel. ''But players are
creatures of habit, and it is very difficult to get them to switch rackets.''

Last year, the company Babolat was sued in California by a customer, Payam
Ahdoot, who asserted that the phrase ''racket of choice'' meant the star used
the racket in question. Babolat argued that this was ''irrationally literal''
but decided to settle rather than slog through the courts.

''We still deny we did anything wrong,'' said Jérôme Pin, the chief executive of
Babolat USA.

The company will now use disclaimers stating that pro players may use a
different racket from the one depicted. But while Rafael Nadal uses an older
version of the AeroPro Drive, which he helped design, it is essentially the one
that is sold to customers, Pin said.

''There's a misconception that we engineer special products for our top stars
and sell something cheaper for the market,'' Pin said.

''There is not a special workshop. Nadal or Tsonga's rackets come off the same
production line and have the exact same frame as the public's rackets,'' he
added, referring to the French player Jo-Wilfried Tsonga.

Eugenie Bouchard plays with a racket right off the shelf, Pin said, but most
professionals ask Babolat to customize the weight and balance or tinker with it
themselves. Club players can also add weight using lead tape, Pin said.

Most amateur players would not play well with Federer's racket. The RF 97
Autograph weighs 340 grams (12 ounces), about 40 more than most consumer models.
This enables players to drive the ball, but over the course of a match, it could
cause late swings or muscle fatigue.

''If you're a serious player and physically strong enough, this might work,''
Lyons said. ''But honestly, a lot of players are better with our other ones.''

After Federer signed off on the RF 97 Autograph, Wilson engineers designed two
lighter models: the Pro Staff 97 and the Pro Staff 97 LS. Cosmetically the same,
the rackets have minor but crucial differences. The Pro Staff 97 has an unstrung
weight of 315 grams (11.1 ounces).

''It's still a serious player's racket, but it is more playable,'' Lyons said.
''If you like the feel of the RF Autograph but feel, 'It's a lot of racket for
me,' you can go to the Pro Staff 97.''

Like the RF 97 Autograph, that racket is made with braided graphite and Kevlar,
but Lyons said, ''We had to shift the balance point when we made it lighter.''

The Autograph's extra weight is in the handle, so it registers as 12 points
head-light (the unit measuring weight balance). By contrast, the Pro Staff 97 is
10 points head-light. For the Pro Staff 97 LS (L stands for light, S for spin),
the engineers took out the Kevlar to reduce the weight. The LS is 290 grams
(10.2 ounces) unstrung, with a wider beam and a drastically different balance (6
points head-light). It also has a different string pattern, with 18 main strings
and 16 crosses, and is more open than the 16-by-19 layout of the two heavier Pro
Staff models.

While the Pro Staff 97 can be seen as the little brother to the Autograph, the
LS is more ''like a cousin,'' Lyons said.

Profile of change // Sales of new Wilson racket herald a move toward wider
frames

BYLINE: DARRELL FRY

SECTION: CITY TIMES; tennis; Pg. 6

LENGTH: 753 words

DATELINE: ST. PETERSBURG



ST. PETERSBURG - Tennis underwent a revolution in the early 1970s:    Metal
rackets replaced the traditional wood frames. Later in the    decade, technology
brought the oversized racket.

     Tennis rackets are taking on a new shape again.

     The Wilson Profile, a wide-frame racket, is so popular that many in    the
tennis industry predict it will change the business.

     "All the other (manufacturers) are copying it. They saw what was    going
on and are reacting to it," said Mike Barrett, tennis pro at    Nevada Bob's
Golf and Tennis Shop, in Tampa. "The Profile has put all    racket technology in
question. It's that unique."

     Donnay, Wimbledon and Pro Kennex have wide-frame rackets on the    market;
Prince, Yamaha and Head are expected to introduce versions this    year. But the
Wilson Profile has a unique feel, tennis pros say.

     Pros and manufacturers discussing the "width" of a tennis racket
actually are referring to its thickness. The hollow Profile frame,    designed
by a German inventor and patented by Wilson, is 1 1/2 inches    at its thickest
point - almost twice as thick as a conventional racket    frame, and thicker
than other wide-frame rackets.

     The extremely stiff Profile frame causes the racket to flex with    the
ball, not after the ball leaves the strings. The result, Wilson
representatives claim, is increased power and control. Wilson also says    the
extra thickness absorbs vibration, making the racket easy on the    arm and
elbow.

     In a recent World Tennis test, the Profile, made of graphite and
fiberglass, tied the magazine's testing record for "playability" and    scored
the highest combined total for power and playability.

     Power with control? Stiff but easy on the arm? Thick but light?

 Those traits are a lot to ask of a racket, but the Profile already has    a
reputation for delivering.

     "I was a 3.0 player, but with the Profile I'm a 4.0 player," said    Peg
Rogers, who owns Advantage Yours Tennis, in Clearwater. "It makes    me better
without practicing."

     "It's the best racket on the market," said Gene Metcalf of    Suncoast
Sports Unlimited, in Largo. "You're probably going to    over-hit on your
groundstrokes until you get used to it."

     Getting used to the Profile is no problem. Getting a Profile can    be.
According to Kathy Button, Wilson's director of public relations,    the company
did not produce many rackets initially.

     "We just wanted to get them out," she said. "It was a big    chance,
because it's kind of wide and big. When it's new technology, it    doesn't
always work."

     This time it has. Consumers reportedly are buying the racket as    fast as
the small shipments hit the stores - despite the suggested    retail price of $
225.

     Button said the racket, without any advertising, "is doing so well    it's
scary. We can't make them fast enough."

     Locally, the racket can be found only in tennis shops. "We've got    six
coming in next month, and they'll be gone in a heartbeat," said    Joe Majer, an
employee at Suncoast Sports Unlimited.

     The demand has forced many shops to create a waiting list. Mason    Tennis
Mart of New York City has a list of 30 to 40 names. "The few    rackets we get
will sell out in two days," an employee said.

     At Nevada Bob's, there is a waiting list of 25. "We got five    rackets in
and we sold them all immediately," Barrett said.

     Button said Wilson is manufacturing more rackets in an effort to    satisfy
the demand. No one on the pro tour uses the racket, because    Wilson has not
promoted it with players and "because we haven't been    able to get a player 12
rackets," Button said, referring to the large    number of rackets that pros
usually require.

     To complement the Profile, Wilson is developing a special string:    "ET
synthetic gut." The string is said to reduce abrasion and thus    last longer.

     Despite the early stream of favorable reviews, Wilson is not    promising
that everyone will like the racket. Some people will either    be turned off by
its price tag or its stiff feel. As Rogers of    Advantage Yours said: "Everyone
has their favorites "

The Tennis Racquet, Reshaped Another Time

SECTION: Section C; Page 11, Column 3; Sports Desk

LENGTH: 179 words


It has been close to a decade since the first oversized tennis racquets came
onto the market, and two decades since Jimmy Connors played with his first steel
racquet. Now comes another oddity: a racquet that its manufacturer, Wilson
Sporting Goods Company of River Grove, Ill., says will set a new standard. A
side view of the racquet shows a tapered midsection that bulges out in the
middle to twice the size of a standard racquet. When seen head-on, it has a
conventional shape. Marketed as the Profile, the racquet is made with high-grade
graphite. It is designed to be extremely stiff but low in vibration. Zina
Garrison of Houston, ranked among the top 10 in women's tennis, has tried the
Profile. She sees it as a big help for players looking for more power in their
stroke; for her, it is a matter of learning to harness the power. The racquet
has alleviated her chronic arm problems, she said. The first shipments are due
in tennis stores next month; quantities will be limited. It will be available in
two head sizes (95- and 110-inch) and will retail for $225.

Get a grip on your tennis racket needs

BYLINE: JOE BROWN

SECTION: FLORIDIAN; DAYS OFF; SPORTSWISE; Pg. 1D

LENGTH: 691 words



A Tampa woman recently found herself short of rent money and decided there  was
only one thing to do: sell stuff.

So she excavated her closets, found all her old sports equipment and carted  it
off to a store that buys such artifacts.

The sale went well and rent looked within reach, until they came to the  last
item: her tennis racket.

"It was a Dunlop," recalled David Goodwill, co-owner of Play It Again  Sports in
Tampa, which buys and sells used and new sports equipment, "but I  remember the
lady couldn't do it. She couldn't let that racket go. She said,  "I used to
practically sleep with this.' "

As a lot of tennis (and racquetball) players know, when you finally find  your
racket, you stick with it.

But for beginners, choosing a racket can be confusing.

"Rackets are as unique as the players," said Jim McCook, a St. Petersburg
tennis enthusiast and semi-pro who repairs rackets as a hobby.

McCook, 46, wears out two or more rackets a year and a heck of a lot of  string.
He keeps up with the latest tennis technology.

"I'm getting older now," he said. "I keep looking for little  advantages."

The right racket does make a difference, McCook said, and knowing how to  choose
it can give you an edge.

How much does the racket flex? How does it generate power? How well does it
reduce shock? McCook demands answers to those questions.

"But for a beginner, I wouldn't suggest you think that much," he said.  "I
suppose the first thing a beginner would want to do is look for something
moderately priced."

Quality isn't cheap

Tennis magazine recently listed some best buys for the quality, but the  least
expensive racket listed, a Spalding InXcess 110, sold for $ 110. Next in  line
was the Wilson Pro Staff 6.0 95 at $ 119.

Racquetball rackets, smaller and less expensive, can still cost as much as  $
50.

"That's why beginners are our biggest clientele," said Goodwill of Play  It
Again Sports, standing next to several rows of used and bargain-priced  rackets.

A $ 100 racket, still in pretty good shape, he said, sells for $ 30 or $ 40.
Racquetball rackets fetch $ 5 and up.

Jim Hord, assistant tennis pro for the last 9 years at Northdale Tennis  Club in
Tampa, suggests spending $ 75 or more.

After price, the next thing to consider is racket size and weight, said  Hord,
who teaches about 80 students a week.

As far as the size of the racket's head (the area where the ball makes
contact), the rule is the same whether for tennis or racquetball: the bigger
the better.

"It's a lot easier for a beginner to develop with a larger head," Hord  said.
"It only makes sense. You're going to hit the ball more often."

In tennis, a racket with a hitting area of 110 square inches or more is
considered large.

Perhaps the most important measurement, however, is grip size, according to
Hord.

Here's how to figure out if a racket's grip is right for you:

Grip the racket as if you are shaking hands with it. Your thumb will cross  the
front of the handle and your fingers will wrap around the back. If the  grip is
the proper size, you should have enough room to place the index finger  of your
other hand on the back of the handle in between the palm portion of  your hand
and the tips of your fingers.

If there's not enough room (that is, if your fingertips wrap all the way  around
the handle and touch your palm), the handle is too small and might turn  in your
hand when the ball hits the racket. That would overwork your forearm  muscles
and could lead to tennis elbow, Hord said.

The same grip test can be used with a racquetball racket.

The weight of the racket should be considered, because too heavy a racket  will
cause fatigue sooner. Let experimentation be your best guide, Hord said.  See if
the sports shop will let you borrow or rent the

racket you are interested in for a test game. "You can only find out by  playing
with it for awhile," Hord said.

Finally, if you want to look good on the court, you must give some thought  to
style. What's hot in tennis right now?

"Anything Andre Agassi is using," Hord said.

SON WINS TITLE THAT ELUDED DAD

BYLINE: By CHARLES FRIEDMAN

SECTION: Section 11; Connecticut; Page 15, Column 1; Connecticut Weekly Desk

LENGTH: 639 words


NEW HAVEN WHEN he was known as the king of the racquet sports in the 1960's,
Dick Squires always found one national title to be most elusive - that for
squash tennis. The game, which has a tradition dating to the early 1900's, is
faster than the more popular game of squash racquets and requires quicker
reflexes. Somehow, it stymied Mr. Squires, who finished a frustrated runner-up
in the national tournament four times.

''It was just something intangible,'' he said one recent day at the busy
Downtown Racquet Club, of which he is the director. ''But it bugged me that I
couldn't win it. I guess my pride was hurt.''

Now some of his pride is restored. His son, Gary, playing in the tournament for
the first time and with little preparation, pulled a stunning upset and captured
the national title at the Yale Club in New York on April 5. At age 25, he is the
youngest ever to win the event.

Gary, head pro at the Downtown Racquet Club and a graduate of Hartwick College
in Oneonta, N.Y., was a little surprised at his success. Previously, he had not
paid much attention to squash tennis.

''I just never got around to it,'' he said, ''although my Dad talked about it a
lot.'' Like his father, he is blond, but at 6 feet 1 inch and 155 pounds, is
taller and not as muscular.

Two weeks before the tournament, Mr. Squires suggested that Gary enter the
competition.  ''I kind of hinted that it would make me feel good if he could win
the title that I could never win,'' he said. ''I thought he had a chance, even
though he was new at it.''

Squash tennis differs from squash racquets in that it is faster and uses a
bigger racquet and ball. It is not as subtle as racquets, though. Because the
ball (a regular tennis ball) comes off the walls at greater speed, one's
reflexes must be sharper to intercept it.  The rallies are shorter than in
racquets and there is less variety in the kind of strokes employed. But it
fosters contrasting styles. One can play aggressively, which is risky, or with
control, which is safer.

As a result of practice sessions between father and son, it was decided that
Gary would do better by hitting aggressively, even though he was more of a
control player in other sports.

''He had the power and speed afoot,'' said Mr. Squires. ''All I had to teach him
was tactics.'' Gary could hardly have had a more qualified teacher. Mr. Squires,
who went to Williams College in Williamstown, Mass., was the consummate
tactician; a stylist who knew how to exploit every inch of court, a sportsman
who played in an era when love of the game prevailed over everything else.

In addition to being a star in competition, he was one of the most persuasive
promoters of racquet sports, writing articles and instruction books, organizing
clubs and tournaments.

''Of all the sports,'' he said, ''I think I enjoyed platform tennis the most. At
least I won more titles in it than the others.'' Gary picked up the
squash-tennis nuances quickly. He swept through the early rounds of the national
tournament, then defeated his opponent in three straight games in the final.

''I got into a kind of rhythm and couldn't seem to miss,'' he said. His father
beamed, and said, ''A natural.'' Gary now plans to concentrate on tennis, which
he sees as offering more opportunities for fame and money. He knows the
competition is very tough, but he figures he has an edge.

''My Dad was a pretty good tennis player, and he'll be helping me,'' he said.

A whole new racket; Active fibers serve a purpose

BYLINE: mailto:ehogstrom@wcinet.comERIK HOGSTROM

SECTION: Pg. d10

LENGTH: 460 words


The ability to hit the perfect tennis shot is getting more scientific all the
time.  One of the latest developments incorporates piezoelectric fibers into a
tennis racket's throat and head. Ultimately, these fibers tighten strings, and
the more taut a racket's strings, the more powerfully a player can hit a ball.

"Piezoelectric fiber is an active fiber that does not like to be disturbed,"
said Jennifer Albert, the communications manager with HEAD/Penn Racquet Sports,
in Phoenix, Ariz.

But when these fibers are disturbed by the striking of a ball, piezoelectric
fibers react by lengthening and changing shape, she said.

They convert mechanical energy to electrical energy, and the reacting fibers
send an electrical impulse up the neck of the racket, Albert said.

"(The impulse) dampens the vibration by 20 percent," she said, "because
electrical impulses have no vibration."

It is the diminished vibration that equates to greater power, Albert said.

The fibers in the racket head create an active resistance upon ball impact that
increases torsional - side-to-side - stability in the racquet by up to 42
percent, Albert said.

The extra stiffness and stabilization cause the ball to leave the strings at the
most precise angle possible, allowing a player to control where the shot is
placed.

"For some of our most powerful rackets, we put a self-powered microchip in the
handle," Albert said.

The chip boosts the electrical energy created by the piezoelectric fibers,
further dampening the vibration.

Designers for HEAD/Penn Racquet Sports placed the piezoelectric fibers in the
racket heads of three models - the i.x3, i.x5 and i.x6. The i.x16 has a
suggested retail price of $$ @325.

Wilson Sporting Goods also market a new racket, called Triad, that tries to
eliminate vibration, said Fred Bissell, the owner of Alpine Tennis Center, 1090
Cedar Cross Road in Dubuque.

"The racket is two pieces," Bissell said, "so the vibration doesn't go from the
racket head to the handle."

The hoop and handle of a Triad racket are designed as customized components that
never touch. The components are separated by a layer of a polymer material
similar to the material used in skyscraper foundations to absorb the shock of an
earthquake.

According to Wilson Sporting Goods in Chicago, Triad models have a suggested
retail price of between $$ @189-$$ @350.

Bissell sells the Triad at Alpine Tennis Center.

Bissell said diminishing vibration could help people who complain of soreness.

"People associate vibration with a sore arm," he said.

However, Bissell thinks people experience soreness for a reason that has nothing
to do with racket technology.

"They're not hitting the ball correctly," he said.

CLARENCE PELL won the United States Racquets Amateur Doubles Championship eight
times between 1937 and 1959. His partner was Robert "Bobby" Grant, the many
times American amateur singles champion. Pell himself won the US Amateur Singles
Championship in 1958.

Son of the great American racquets champion C.C. Pell, Clarence Pell was an
important figure in the history of racquets and court tennis in America. He
served on the board of directors of the Racquet and Tennis Club of New York from
1952 to 1997 and acted as an officer for many years. He was governor of the
Beaver Dam Winter Sports Club in Locust Valley, New York, for 51 years, 16 as
president.

In his later years he retired to Rhode Island, in order to further his ambition
of restoring the court tennis court in Newport. He become the first president of
the National Tennis Court, as it became known and as such became important in
the promotion of the game in the United States.

Court tennis, also known as royal tennis or real tennis, is the forerunner to
most racquet games. It has an intricate scoring system and is played on an
indoor court. The most famous example of a real tennis court is the one built
for Henry VIII at Hampton Court Palace in Surrey.

Pell was born in 1911 in New York. He was educated at the Pomfret School, where
he excelled at ice hockey, and at Harvard University, where he played hockey and
took up racquets.

During the Second World War he served overseas as a pilot with the US Army Air
Force. He retained an interest in aviation in his professional life after the
war, becoming an aviation insurance executive. In 1968 he was appointed
director- general of Air Transport Insurance, a co-operative owned by American
airline companies. He also headed a similar organisation for the nuclear power
industry and consulted on insurance matters for the US Federal Aviation
Administration.

Pell was descended from the Englishman Sir John Pell, former owner of what is
now Westchester County in New York State. Sir John had sold 6,000 acres to the
French Huguenot founders of the city of New Rochelle for pounds 1,525. Part of
the 1689 contract stipulated that the city fathers would pay the Pell family
"one Fat Calfe". Clarence Pell took part in several ceremonies to commemorate
his ancestor's role in the establishment of the city.

Although racquets proved too fast a game for Pell in his later years, he
continued playing and teaching court tennis with great enthusiasm well into his
eighties. He was last on the court two weeks before his death.

Clarence Cecil Pell, racquet and court tennis player: born New York 26 October
1911; married 1969 Francesca Hinckley (two sons, one daughter); died Providence,
Rhode Island 12 May 1998.

Kenton Jernigan, yesterday to take the 80th United States Squash Racquet
Association men's singles championship. The scores were 15-11, 8-15, 15-7,
18-16.

In women's competition, Alicia McConnell of Brooklyn Heights held off a strong
challenge from Sue Cogswell of Manhattan to win her fifth straight title, 15-11,
14-16, 15-6, 9-15, 15-9.

The tournament, the longest running event in the sport, was held at 13 squash-
racquet facilities throughout Manhattan. Finals were played at the University
Club.

In addition to the men's and women's open events, nearly 600 amateur players
competed in 16 age-group draws.

Jernigan, a 21-year-old Harvard senior from Newport, R.I., was a heavy favorite
to take a fourth straight title and thus tie a record for consecutive victories
set by Victor Niederhoffer, who won from 1972 through 1975. But LaBossier, who
has played in Jernigan's shadow during his junior and collegiate career, had
other ideas.

Match of His Life

The 22-year-old LaBossier, playing the match of his life, took a hard-fought
first game, prevailing with excellent retrieving in crisp rail shots. Jernigan
stormed back in the second game, however, mixing his shots more effectively and
using his enormous power to keep his opponent off balance.

LaBossier, a native of Seattle, regained control in the third game, running up
an 11-2 lead. He was aided by numerous unforced errors into the tin by the
defending champion.

The fourth game was a crowd-pleasing, seesaw battle that went to 13-all, at
which point Jernigan selected a first 5-of-9 overtime. At 2-all, LaBossier won 2
straight points, the first in the backhand cross-court nick and the second when
Jernigan hit a deep backhand into the tin. Jernigan rallied for another point
but then wrongly hit a backhand reverse corner shot into the middle of the tin
to give LaBossier an 18-16 game and the national amateur championship.

LaBossier, who also upset Jernigan in last year's collegiate championships, was
elated by his victory.

''I was hitting my rail shots tighter than he was and hitting the ball more
crisply,'' he said afterward. ''I was also getting to everything he hit.''

St. Petersburg squad is headed to state again

The Racquet Club of St. Petersburg clinched a second consecutive 3.5 district
championship in the USA Senior Men's League.

The title assures the team a second straight appearance in the USA Tennis
Florida State Tournament, scheduled for May.

Last weekend, the Racquet Club downed East Lake Woodlands 3-0 in the district
final.

Tony Damouny and Steve Uebel maintained their undefeated record with a 6-2, 7-6
(7-5) victory in the No. 1 position. When Ray Cianci and Tom Stewart won in
straight sets at No. 2, the Racquet Club knew it had clinched the crown.

Bob Steele and Don Campagna rallied at No. 3 to win 6-2, 4-6, 7-5, giving the
Racquet Club a clean sweep of East Lake.

"Steve and I have played together the last three years and complement one
another's game," Damouny said.

"Steve's an all-court player, has great touch at the net and gets a lot of
putaways there," Damouny said. "I'm basically a baseliner and hit hard to help
set him up."

While Cianci and Stewart completed their match, Steele and Campagna were in a
battle.

"After winning the first set 6-2, we fell behind 3-0 in the second," Steele
said. "We were even down 5-2 in the third set before we pulled things together.

"Don has a strong serve and a solid groundstroke game. Our styles are
contrasting, with mine having more movement around the net. As regular partners
these last two years, we've learned the other's game, and that works to our
advantage."

After reaching the state semifinal round last year, the team has raised its
hopes.

"We talked at the beginning of the season and decided we would play the players
that would best do the job for us," captain Marshall Craig said.

"We wanted to put out the most competitive representative team each match, with
the intent of advancing to the playoffs."

A 7-0 record in the regular season advanced the Racquet Club to the district
playoffs.

In the first round, it beat Feather Sound Country Club 3-0. A 2-1 victory over
the Phil Green Tennis Academy moved the Racquet Club to the final with East
Lake, which had eliminated a second Racquet Club squad in the opening round.
After defeating Royal Racquet Club in a semifinal, East Lake faced the unbeaten
Racquet Club team in the championship.

"We have a group of about 40 guys at the club that are at the 3.5 level, and of
those, around 15 are very competitive," Craig said. "That's a testament to the
quality of play we have at the Racquet Club."

The squad is comprised of 11 players. Rounding out the roster are George Routh,
Russ Barlow, David Laesser and Ron Whitaker.

NET NOTES: Garrett Betsarakis upset the second seed in a 10-and-under division
semifinal, advancing to the championship in the Arbor Greene Junior Super Series
in Tampa.

When the No. 3 seed was unable to play in the final, Betsarakis was named the
winner.

Nicholas Berning teamed with Justin Herzig to reach the 14 doubles title match.

 Phillip Barlow was a 16 finalist in the Seminole Winter Classic.

 Reinaldo Valor collected two 55-and-over titles, one in the Treasure Island
Super Seniors 2002 and the other in the St. Petersburg Country Club Super Senior
Championships.

Other winners at TI were Dave Krebs (65), Bob Allen and Andy Chau (75 doubles)
and Tom Avirett and Don Wray (80). Bud Steckman took the 75 singles consolation
crown.

At the SPCC event, Krebs won a second 65 title, as well as the doubles with Al
Blackburn. Bob Meyerdierks captured the 75 crown in straight sets. Jim Vuille
won in the 90 division. And John Rensch and Rich Boddicker defeated Doug Wood
and Rob Royden in 55 doubles.

LITTLE MO: Planning is underway for the Racquet Club of St. Petersburg to host
Florida's qualifying event for the Little Mo Tournament.

It's the only national tourney for girls and boys 8-11.

The 26-year-old Little Mo is scheduled for May 11-13 at the Racquet Club. The
eight quarterfinalists in each age division advance to one of four regionals.
Regional semifinalists qualify for the nationals.

The Little Mo program is sponsored by the Maureen Connolly Brinker Tennis
Foundation. In 1953, Connolly was the first woman to win the Grand Slam at the
age of 18. An injury the next year ended her career.

For tournament information, call 527-6553.

SUPER SENIORS:  St. Petersburg Tennis Center raised its record to 4-1 with a 3-0
victory over Treasure Island Tennis and Yacht Club. Winning in straight sets
were Horst Brinkman and Allen Kline at No. 1, Doug Eadie and Tom Clark and Bill
Wallace and Ron Hild.

COMING UP: The Super Seniors Invitational - for men in singles and doubles in
the 55-and-over, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85 and 90 divisions - began Tuesday at
Seminole Lake Tennis Center and continues through Monday. For information, call
394-1733. Sarmiento's Annual Championships, for juniors, are March 23-25 at St.
Petersburg Tennis Center. Call Al Sarmiento, 360-2643.

Racket Man Courts Many Dreams; Potomac School's Allen Ranked in Three Sports

Tara Finnegan , Washington Post Staff Writer

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. D08

LENGTH: 1134 words


The den in the Allen family's McLean home is filled with a load of sports
equipment. Bradley Allen proudly takes credit for the clutter.

"One time, my brother [Yorke] and I counted at least 17 tennis rackets," said
Allen, noting the room's closet is stuffed with racket bags and stringing
machines.

Allen, who is a sophomore at Potomac School, owns most of the various rackets
and uses them all well. He is ranked nationally in tennis, squash and court
tennis, which is an older version of tennis played indoors by English and French
nobility in the 16th and 17th centuries.

Austin Snelgrove, who is a teaching pro at Regency Sport & Health Club in
McLean, coaches Allen in squash and court tennis. He said Allen's ability to
play three racket sports at a high level is rare.

"It's pretty unusual because you don't just have to have good hand-eye
coordination," Snelgrove said.

Allen is in his second year competing on the squash and tennis teams at Potomac
School. He began playing court tennis, which is not offered in high school
competition, in September 1997, after a court was built at the sports club in
McLean.

For now, Allen is focused on the tennis season. He plays No. 1 and No. 2 singles
(No. 2 when his brother chooses to compete) and is 6-0 with four wins in the top
singles spot. Allen spends most afternoons on the tennis court and practices the
other racket sports in his free time.

"It really depends on what kind of tournament I have that week," Allen said.
"Right now, I'm playing tennis and I pretty much play squash and court tennis
about two times a week."

Allen practices tennis with his brother, Yorke, who has been accepted to Duke on
a tennis scholarship. Yorke Allen dabbled in squash and court tennis, but unlike
his younger brother, he chose to stick to one racket sport.

"I tried court tennis once, and it hurt my wrist because the racket weighs a
ton. Squash is good exercise, but I'm not nearly as good at it as Bradley," he
said. "My parents and I want Bradley to settle down and just do one thing, but
that's ultimately up to him. . . . He's able to play all three sports, and he's
doing pretty well."

Last year in the 16-and-under age group, Allen was ranked as high as 19th in the
country by the U.S. Squash Racquets Association. The U.S. Tennis Association
ranked him No. 190 nationally in the 16-and-under age group, and regionally he
was ranked No. 9 by the Mid-Atlantic Tennis Association, which includes
Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia and the District.

Allen also has excelled in court tennis. Last August, he traveled to London's
Queens Club and won the British Junior Open court tennis championship in the
under-16 division.

His overall success is incentive to keep playing. "My feeling is that I'm 16
years old and I don't need to be committing myself to doing just one thing," he
said. "You'll see some kids that specialize and play just tennis. They are going
to have a high national ranking and probably play on their college team. I want
to be diversified, and I don't want to be backed into doing just tennis and then
not being able to back out of it. I want to leave my options open."

Allen picked up his first racket sport -- tennis -- at age 9. When he was 14, he
was the top-ranked player in that age division in the Mid-Atlantic region and
ranked 35th nationally. At the same time, Allen also worked to improve his
squash game. He has been the top singles player on Potomac School's squash team
for the past two seasons and has a 21-5 record.

"I've seen lots of good tennis players, and they don't necessarily make good
squash players," Potomac School squash coach Eric Wapes said. "Bradley took to
squash very quickly, and you have to be in tremendous condition to play. It is
much faster than tennis. Bradley has uncommonly good racket sense, and he's also
mentally unflappable."

Court tennis is similar to tennis -- which used to be called lawn tennis -- but
it is played indoors surrounded by four walls. There is a net at midcourt, but
the ball is served off the side walls. The sport is played with wooden rackets
that are much heavier than the high-tech ones used in modern tennis. Andy
Kinzler, head of junior development for the U.S. Court Tennis Association, said
there are nine court tennis facilities in the United States, where approximately
750 people play the sport.

The three sports require different equipment and have different rules and
scoring, but the goal for each is similar.

"Basically the idea of running the opponent out of position is the same strategy
in all of them," Snelgrove said.

Being an all-court player -- one who is comfortable at the net and behind the
baseline -- has helped Allen succeed in the three sports.

"I like to serve and volley in regular tennis and volleying is an important
aspect of court tennis," Allen added. "Court tennis is also like squash because
there are walls on all sides. In squash, you sometimes have to dig the ball out
of the corners, and that shot also translates well to court tennis."

The heavy, small-headed rackets and the heavier balls make court tennis
challenging to a novice. Snelgrove describes court tennis much like golf in
terms of the initial frustration.

"You either love it, because when you hit that one ball out of 50 right, it
feels great. Or you wind up hating it, because you can't hit the ball,"
Snelgrove said.

With college being two years away, Allen knows he may have to concentrate on one
sport to increase his chance to earn a scholarship. But if he has a choice, he
would like to continue as a two-sport athlete.

"I've thought about the college issue and I know it's difficult to play two
sports competitively in college," Allen said. "I'd like to go somewhere that has
decent teams in both tennis and squash."

Racket Sports

Tennis -- Matches are best-of-three, six-game sets or in some cases,
best-of-five sets. At 6-6 in games, a 12-point tiebreaker is played.

Squash -- World Squash Federation rules say a match consists of best-of-five
sets. Each game is to nine points. If score is 8-8, game can be played until
someone wins the next point or wins the next two in succession. Squash rackets
are lighter than both tennis and court tennis rackets.

Court tennis -- Scoring similar to tennis, except when sets are tied at 5, the
next game wins the set. Can play best-of-three or best-of-five sets. The sport
was originally played by monks in Italy and France in the 1100s, when people
used their bare hands and a cloth-covered ball. Later, wooden rackets were
incorporated. The sport became popular among royalty in the 1600s. The first
courts in the United States were built in 1876. Sophomore Bradley Allen displays
his three rackets of choice: tennis, court tennis and squash.

New Tennis Website Takes a Unique Approach to Finding Tennis Rackets

BYLINE: TennisRacket.Me

LENGTH: 410  words


Santa Rosa, CA, October 28, 2016 --(PR.com)-- Tennisracket.me, a new tennis
website, has developed a proprietary algorithm that provides a player with a
perfect tennis racket.

The usual process of finding a right racket is very tiresome for any tennis
player, as there are several deciding factors to consider before buying an ideal
racket which is neglected by many. To make this complicated procedure much
easier tennisracket.me has simplified the process by which a tennis player can
easily find a racket. The proprietary algorithm available at the website helps a
tennis player to find the most suitable racket according to their playing style
easily.

This website is created by two tennis enthusiasts, Mike Volkin, an entrepreneur
and Thomas Jensen, a tech specialist. Mike realized that it is quite difficult
to find a tennis racket online that would best suit his playing style. After
searching over several websites, he couldn't come across any, which suggested a
perfect tennis racket that matches his preferences and needs. He then discussed
this problem with Thomas and both of them understood the need of developing an
algorithm. After working for several months together, Thomas and Mike developed
an accurate algorithm that analyzes thousands of data points that help a player
find the perfect racket.

The algorithm is free of cost, it is also very easy to use and understand; a
player has to visit the website, tennisracket.me and answer the questionnaire.
These questions are very specific and enquire about the weight, playing level,
physical condition, and other important details. Once the survey is completed, a
list of tennis rackets is provided that accurately matches the playing style of
a player.

With so many tennis rackets available in the market choosing the best is a
time-consuming task. But with the aid of this breakthrough algorithm on
tennisracket.me selecting a suitable tennis racket has become much easier and
simplified.

About the Company:

TennisRacket.me was created by two passionate tennis players - Mike Volkin, who
is also an entrepreneur and marketer and Thomas Jensen, a tech specialist by
profession. This website offers a quick and easy way for players to find the
most suitable racket that works best with their style of play. The service works
through a proprietary algorithm that asks a few questions to players, collects
various specific data points and analyzes them to suggest the most suitable
racket for their game.

TROY RESIDENT MAKES RACQUETBALL HIS RACKET;
RALPH KUSCHE PUTS THE STRINGS ON SPORT'S EQUIPMENT

BYLINE: Steve Horrell; Special To The Post-Dispatch

SECTION: MADISON COUNTY POST, Pg. 5

LENGTH: 780 words

DATELINE: TROY


Baseball legend has it that early in Ted Williams' career, a bat company
official laid six nearly identical baseball bats before the Red Sox slugger and
challenged him to pick out the one, blindfolded, that was half an ounce heavier.
Williams did it, twice in a row.

That's the sort of thing Ralph Kusche could relate to. He is the lone employee
of Ralph's Racquets, a business he works at in his home in Troy.

He's an expert with tennis and racquetball rackets, a certified racket
technician who can calibrate the desired tension on a broken racket and mend it
for you in minutes.

Kusche doesn't sleep with rackets the way Williams slept with his favorite bats,
but he's every bit as passionate about equipment.

Certified racket technicians not only string rackets - racquetball rackets,
tennis rackets, and, less frequently, badminton and squash rackets - they have
also studied racket technology and design enough to help players match their
playing level and style with the right racket.

Every so often, when it needs someone to test their latest model, the marketing
department at Wilson, a nationally known racquetball racket maker, seeks Kusche
out for his advice. For a few weeks, Kusche gets to play with it. Then he gives
Wilson his insights about things such as string tension and feel. But it's
stringing he likes best and if someday his client base grows enough, he may quit
his telecommunications job at Bridge Information Systems in St. Louis and run
Ralph's Racquets full time.

"I do that mostly because I have to," he says of his day job, "and I do this
because I'm passionate about it." Ralph's Racquets is actually a small carpeted
room off the living room of his home in the west part of Troy. He begins mending
a racquetball racket by clamping the frame into place and placing the free end
of the nylon string into the grip of a rectangular machine called an electronic
tensioner, which measures string tension. The machine cost him $ 800 - $ 650
more than an ordinary string tension machine, but it's worth it: when it comes
to calibrations, it's virtually never off.

He got started in the business in 1991, after he found himself breaking his own
strings every two weeks. Now he strings two or three racquetball rackets a week
and as many as 30 tennis rackets a week during the high school season. He
derives more satisfaction by doing racquetball rackets, since those players have
long had to entrust their rackets and their luck to people who make their living
with tennis.

"There are very few people that know how to do racquetball right," he maintains.
"The nature of the game is different from tennis and you can't just take what
works for tennis and apply it to racquetball. If you want to learn how to fix
cars, somebody can show you how to fix your car, but that doesn't mean you're
necessarily going to be able to go out and fix somebody's Cadillac."

Unlike tennis, racquetball rackets lack consistency from manufacturer to
manufacturer. A few years ago, a racquetball maker designed a string that ran up
through the handle and wound around it several times.

"They came up with another one where the string actually wraps around the
frame," he said. "If you don't see it and line it up right ahead of time, it's
impossible to get it right."

Kusche draws clients from Madison and St. Clair counties. Most of his referrals
come from Scott Air Force Base, the YMCAs in Edwardsville andGranite City, the
Nautilus Fitness and Racquet Club in Alton, the Belleville Health and Sports
Center, and area high schools, including Edwardsville and Triad. In fall 1995,
when ESPN2 needed something to promote pro racquetball, its camera crews came to
Troy and filmed Kusche doing his thing. It aired for less than a minute, but it
landed him two unexpected clients: five-time world champion Cliff Swain and
two-time national amateur champ Andy Roberts. Kusche travels to the Chicago area
for tournaments, and often strings 30 to 55 rackets from Friday night to Sunday
afternoon.

Kusche advertises his services by leaving a calling card and brochure near the
indoor racquetball courts, and every so often he drives there to pick up rackets
that are waiting to be strung. To pick up, fix, and return, he charges about $
20 a racquet. Those dropped off at his home are a few dollars less. Most rackets
take from 15 to 18 minutes to string. "I've done 'em in 9 1/2," he adds.

A typical racquetball racket has 14 vertical strings that serve as base strings.
The 19 horizontal strings are weaved over and under the base string as the
tensioner pulls the string tight. It seems to be tedious work but actually,
Kusche says, it isn't.

EX-SIUC PLAYER ADVANCES TO FINAL IN MEN'S 35 TOURNEY

BYLINE: Ron Cobb Of the Post-Dispatch Staff

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 8B

LENGTH: 614 words


A championship match between former Southern Illinois University-Carbondale
teammates was shaping up as a possibility Tuesday night when Sal Castillo of El
Paso, Texas, advanced to the final of the USTA National Men's 35 Indoor at Town
and Country Racquet Club.  Castillo, a 7-5, 7-6 winner over Bob Knox of West
Richland, Wash., was a freshman at SIUC in 1973-74 when Jorge Ramirez was a
senior there. But Ramirez, the head pro at Woodsmill Racquet Club, fell one step
short of the final when he lost 4-6, 6-2, 7-5 to Gerry Berkheimer of Lexington,
Ky., on Tuesday night in the second semifinal.  In a late doubles semifinal,
Forest Lake Tennis Club pro Jim Hammond and Gil Rincon of LaPeer, Mich., faced
Castillo and Peter Bronson of Scottsdale, Ariz.  The singles final is scheduled
for 6 tonight, with the doubles final to follow.  Castillo hopes to be the third
El Pasoan to win the tournament in the last five years. Rincon, originally from
El Paso, won in 1986 and Ross Walker, now an El Paso resident, won in 1988.
''I'm kind of proud of it - three El Pasoans in the final,'' Castillo said.  ''I
just hope I can do what those guys did. There will be a little pressure on me.''
Castillo earns a living as a private tennis instructor and coach on a court in
his back yard. Many of his pupils are junior players who come across the border
from Mexico. Ramirez, coincidentally, is a former Junior Davis Cup player for
Mexico, but he and Castillo didn't know each other until they met at SIUC.
Castillo left Carbondale after one year.  He is in his first year in the
35-and-over division and is playing in his second national tournament. At the
USTA National Men's 35 Hardcourts in March in Little Rock, Ark., he won the
singles consolation title and the doubles championship.  A year ago, he said,
the Wilson Profile wide-body racket that he was using was giving him elbow
problems, and from July until March he experimented with all sorts of other
models. He took three different rackets to Little Rock and finally settled on a
''very slender Wimbledon wide-body'' that he says treats his elbow just fine.

Mar. 9--What's the deal with the Prince O3 Speed Challenge?

Well, it has something to do with tennis, a sports company -- not the eccentric
rock star who shares the same name -- and a challenge. But is it a competition?
Is it a dare to enroll in a tennis class?

Close, but not exactly.

It's actually an opportunity for tennis competitors and consumers to try out the
latest line of goods from Prince Sports under the supervision of Mountain View
tennis pros.

"Basically, the speed challenge events are part of a 24-city tour that
criss-crosses the country," said Zach Perles, a spokesman for Prince. "It allows
players of all ages and levels to test the newest and greatest technology ...
players can test their racquets against this technology."

The Prince O3 Speed Challenge will take place on Saturday at the Cuesta Park
Tennis Center in Mountain View. The event is scheduled to take place from 9 a.m.
to 9 p.m. If it rains Saturday, the event will resume Sunday. Those who
participate put themselves in position to win prizes, including a trip for two
to the U.S. Open.

"You can win a trip to that and Nick Bollettieri's Tennis Academy or to Saddle
Brook Resort in Florida," Northern California Prince Tennis representative John
Rushworth said. "You get a decoder card and hold it up to your computer to see
if you win or there's a way you can send in a card."

Since introducing an oversized racquet in 1976, Prince has received nothing but
praise from the tennis community for revolutionizing products. It stuck to this
trend in 1995 by releasing a long-body racquet and 10 years later created what
the company now calls O3 technology, a platform which serves to capitalize on
oversize string holes (O-ports) to improve upon aerodynamics.

Tennis players, since the sport relies heavily on racquet speed, continue to
ride the O3 bandwagon in an attempt to gain an edge. Last year, Prince's O3
White model was the top-selling racquet in the sport, while its Gut Duraflex
string remained the No. 1 seller for a fifth consecutive year.

"If you are late with your stroke, you won't be with our rackets," Rushworth
said.

The latest racquets based on O3 technology are called Speedport racquets. They
were launched in January and will be on display Saturday in Mountain View.
Players who attend the event can test the three newest models -- Red, Blue and
Silver -- in order to discover which model best complements their game.

"It is access to free advice and insight," Perles said. "Local area teaching
pros will be on the court running drills to help match players with the racquet
that best fits their game."

Perles is confident those in attendance will find the perfect fit, too.

"The position gives this racquet more speed through the air," Perles said. "It's
24 percent more speed than traditional racquets."

According to Perles, other important elements such as weight, precision and
power were not compromised in order to obtain this speed, while the sweet spots
on these racquets are 59 percent larger than traditional racquets as well.

KIDS GET FUN, SUN - AND RACKETS

BYLINE: By Kristy Shonka Staff Writer

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. C01

LENGTH: 459 words


The Club at Raes Creek sent out 3,500 fliers advertising Kids' Day at the Taylor
Infiniti $25,000 Women's Pro Circuit Event.

At least 65 made it into parents' hands. That's about how many kids showed up
Tuesday for an hour of fun in the sun with a little tennis instruction thrown
in. It was quite an improvement from the club's first run at sponsoring the free
clinic.

Last year's Kids' Day was rained out, and when the club rescheduled it for the
next day, eight kids showed up to be taught by 12 professionals. This year the
professionals of the future outnumbered the real thing 13 to 1.

Richard Cutler, the club's owner, said it wasn't just the sunny skies that
helped increase the turnout.

"The trick was to give away the rackets," he said.

Although a few girls came out looking like mini-pros with their tennis skirts,
rackets and bags, most kids showed up empty handed. No one left that way,
though. Every kid who showed up received a brand new tennis racket to keep.

"That might get them to go home and hit against their garage," said Henri
Elkins, the club's tennis director, who was hoping to inspire future tennis
stars through this clinic.

Jonathan and Nicholas Novajosky used to use their parents' rackets to practice
at their Martinez home. When they brought the fliers for the clinic home to
their mom, Maria Novajosky saw it as an opportunity for her sons - who just
started to play tennis - to learn a little about the sport.

And the free rackets will come in handy next week. For spring break, the family
rented a condominium in Hilton Head, S.C., and a few family tennis matches are
in the works.

"It's nice, because (tennis) is something you can do with the kids," she said.

Novajosky's boys joined the rest of the kids in learning how to hit forehand,
backhand and volley shots from the pros. The majority looked to be enjoying
themselves. From those who landed perfect shots toothers who nearly spun
themselves into the ground after swinging through a backhand attempt.

Kaysie Smashey, who was one of the most vocal of the professional players
working the clinic, wasn't too happy after she lost her first-round singles
match earlier in the day.

But she went for a run to burn off the negative energy, and it must have worked
because the kids loved her.

The feeling was mutual.

"I just enjoy seeing the kids happy," said Smashey, 24, between autograph
signings.

Her group certainly was happy after Smashey's Smashers beat pro Aleke Tsoubanos'
Slicers in a relay race. Tsoubanos had ordered a rematch, but then Elkins called
the clinic to a close by ordering a group photo.

And instead of saying the customary "cheese," waiting parents heard a resounding
shout of "tennis."

TENNIS / Rod Carlyle; Get a grip on putting powerful serves in play; Ball speed,
spin increase if proper method is used

BYLINE: By Rod Carlylesports; tennis; gwinnett/county

SECTION: GWINNETT EXTRA; SECTION J; PAGE 06

LENGTH: 275 words


The past few weeks we have been discussing the different grips for forehands,
backhands and volleys. This leaves one last shot that needs grip evaluation: the
serve.

Most people simply use the same grip that they hit their forehand with, and then
end up adjusting their swing to accommodate it. They are able to get serves in,
but they are giving up long-range improvement.

If you will get prepared to serve and then bring your racket up to the hitting
area, you will find that the face of your racket is not pointing toward the
service box. In order to get the ball to go in the court, they have to pull
their arm across their body. This does get the ball in the court, but both power
and spin are sacrificed.

The overwhelming majority of good servers use either the continental or eastern
backhand grip when serving. This allows the racket face to be in the proper
position when the racket goes to the hitting area. With the racket in position,
the server is now able to pull the racket toward the target.

Since the racket now is going the correct way, the server can dramatically
increase the speed and spin that can be put on the shot.

The next time you are watching Stefan Edberg serve, notice that his racket face
is pointing toward the ground. If you put your racket face in this position, you
will find that you now have the backhand grip.

Wouldn't it be nice to be able to serve like Edberg? A good way to be able to do
this would be to use the same grip he does.

Rod Carlyle is co-owner and teaching professional at Old South Racquet Club near
Snellville. His column appears weekly in the Gwinnett Extra.

Brief return to wood fun for tennis players

BYLINE: Ryan Severance, The Pueblo Chieftain, Colo.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 370 words


July 26--There was a decidedly old-school feel at the City Park Tennis Courts
Saturday afternoon.

A few dozen players converged there to play in a casual tennis tournament with a
catch: They had to use wooden rackets, most of which were made and used in the
1970s.

"We had one of these a few years back and it was fun. We didn't have a whole lot
of people come out because it was short notice so I wanted to do another one,"
said Chris Roman, a local tennis pro who organized the event.

"I think it's fun to get everyone out and just see what tennis used to be like,
especially for the younger kids that have these big, powerful rackets now."

Those who participated all played opponents at their same skill level. Every
round each player got a new partner to play with and competed against a new
team.

Roman said the difference between playing with wooden rackets and the more
advanced rackets used today is drastic.

"With the wood racket you really have to have a good technique because the wood
deadens the shot quite a bit," he said. "You can't hit with as much spin because
you have to hit through the ball a little more so it's more of a feel game with
the wood rackets. There's a smaller head and smaller sweet spot. With rackets
today you can still hit an off-center shot with amazing power and spin."

Daniel Hawk, a competitive 22-year-old tennis player who has played for Colorado
State University-Pueblo the past two years, had very little experience using a
wood racket before Saturday.

"I've hit a couple of times with them just messing around," Hawk said. "The head
size is a huge difference, for Roman said the weight of wood rackets is a
challenging adjustment for players to make.

sure. The weight is, too. Those are the biggest things. The ratio is just much
different with them."

Roman said the weight of wood rackets is a challenging adjustment for players to
make.

"The wood rackets are around 14 ounces which doesn't sound like a lot compared
to rackets today which are 9 ounces, but when you swing it you definitely feel
it," he said.

ON YOUR OWN;
New, Light Model

BYLINE: By BARBARA LLOYD

SECTION: Section C; Page 9; Column 1; Sports Desk

LENGTH: 244 words


Spectra, a new
synthetic fiber that
is being used in bullet
proof vests, helicopter
shields and sails for yachts,
has now found its way into tennis racquets. Ellipse Sport, a company based in
Redmond, Wash., was founded last year with development of its line of Spectra
racquets. Tom Barrows, president of Ellipse, said recently that his company has
an informal agreement with Allied-Signal, the firm that manufactures Spectra, to
be the sole tennis racquet producer using the material.

Spectra is known to be lighter and stronger than other materials used in
racquets, said Barrows. But it is difficult to get it to bond to graphite,
another major component of modern tennis racquets. Ellipse overcame the problem
by changing Spectra's characteristics. In the process the fiber is energized
with radio frequencies in a gas-filled chamber. The technique abrades the
surface of Spectra so that it will adhere to other materials.

Having introduced its first racquets, the Fusion, Fusion-S and Explosion in
February 1990, the firm began marketing its newest model, the Fusion-E, last
month. The racquet weighs 11 ounces with strings, a half an ounce less than a
conventional racquet. A pad of Spectra felt of four inches by one-half inch is
embedded in the racquet at the throat, an attempt by Ellipse to further enhance
its shock-absorbing characteristics, said Barrows.

The Fusion models sell at retail for $235. Information: Ellipse, (800) 553-7875.

Stringing In a New Direction

SECTION: Section C; Page 11, Column 5; Sports Desk

LENGTH: 235 words


When Madeline Hauptman was a graduate student in mathematics at the University
of Pennsylvania, she was taught to examine the way objects are made. She looked
at her tennis racquet and wondered why the strings were in a horizontal and
vertical weave. The snowshoes on the wall in her apartment were strung in a
third, diagonal direction.

''I asked myself why the Indians would string a snowshoe three ways instead of
two ways, as with a basket,'' she said recently. ''They must have realized that
it would be possible to distribute a man's weight more evenly across the snow if
the impact is distributed in six directions.''

In the late 1970's, Hauptman calculated a formula to determine where to drill
holes on a racquet to add diagonal strings. Then she re-strung a racquet, tried
it and decided she was on to something.

Hauptman patented the idea, but was unable to sell it to tennis-racquet
manufacturers. She sold the concept to Omega Sports, which produces racquetball
racquets. Since 1980, Hauptman said, Omega has sold more than half a million
racquets strung according to her design.

The 38-year-old Hauptman, who lives in Scarsdale, N.Y., has decided to market
the tennis racquet on her own. She has started a company called Mad Raq (for
Madeline's Racquets). The midsized version costs about $180 with strings; the
oversized racquet is $190. For information, call Mad Raq at (914) 723-1116.

RACKET SALES SHOW TENNIS GROWTH

BYLINE: Ron Cobb

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 8D

LENGTH: 1054 words


Somebody must be doing something right.  Figures made public this spring by the
American Tennis Industry Federation show that sales of tennis rackets grew by 14
percent last year, partly because of a surge in interest in wide-body rackets
and partly because of people taking up the game.  Wholesale sales were $111.8
million in 1987, $128.4 million in 1988 and $146.7 million in 1989. Those
increases are partly a result of escalating prices for rackets, but the
federation also said that the number of rackets sold jumped 16 percent in 1989,
to nearly 3.6 million.  This says more people are playing tennis, as do these
figures that indicate that most rackets sold are for youngsters or beginners: Of
all rackets sold in 1989, 2.27 million cost less than $50 at wholesale, 830,000
cost between $50 and $100, and 450,000 cost more than $100.  Keeping this growth
pattern going is what the St. Louis Tennis Industry Council is about. Headed by
local people such as Suzette Guffey, Steffen Porter and Mark Platt, the council
hopes to give the sport a shot in the arm this summer by offering free clinics
at 14 locations in July.  The 1 1/2-hour workshops will be for adults 21 years
old and over. Rackets and balls will be provided if needed. Participants will be
offered $3 discounts off $8 and $10 tickets to the Grand Champions' Budweiser
Tennis Championship, July 19-22 at Town & Country Racquet Club, and they will
receive keychains that will be good for admission to a party (free hors
d'oeuvres, cash bar) at Casa Gallardo at 12796 Manchester Road beginning at 10
p.m. July 21. Following are the sites and times of the clinics. To sign up, call

Patents;
Tennis anyone? A designer thinks he has an answer to vibrations that may cause
elbow problems.

BYLINE: By Teresa Riordan

DATELINE: WASHINGTON


BECAUSE they are both lightweight and strong, graphite tennis racquets have in
the last decade eclipsed those made of wood or aluminum. But the graphite frames
tend to vibrate more than those of other materials and therefore, some think,
aggravate such afflictions as tennis elbow.

Brett P. Bothwell, an architectural designer in Manhattan who sometimes creates
graphite furniture and also works as a tennis pro, said he had invented a way to
reduce a racquet's vibration by using air pressure to tighten its strings.

The hoop, or head, of Mr. Bothwell's racquet has an outside frame and an inside
frame between which he has fitted two air bladders resembling bicycle tire
tubes.

"As the bladders fill with air, the outer frame is pushed away from the inner
frame, thereby stretching the strings," Mr. Bothwell said. "This air system
gives the racquet an enlarged sweet spot -- that place where you feel no
vibration, just a clean, strong hit."

A hand-held carbon dioxide cartridge inserted into the racquet handle inflates
the bladders. The string tension can be adjusted by adding or releasing some
carbon dioxide. "I've designed the racquet so that you can use the same
cartridges used to inflate Reebok's Instapump athletic sneakers," Mr. Bothwell
said.

Mr. Bothwell received patent 5,458,331.

A Toothbrush For Dentures

Washing dentures can be a tricky task for those with arthritis or other physical
limitations. "If you drop and break them not only do you have the expense of
replacing them but you also have the social difficulty of being without teeth,"
said Martin Lewkowicz, a former dentist, who has designed a special toothbrush
that he said a user can grip firmly in any position.

Dr. Lewkowicz's invention is shorter and fatter than the average toothbrush and
is curvy and clad in a non-slip rubber. At its head it sprouts two sets of
brushes that meet at a slightly obtuse angle.

"Most of the other brushes on the market have thin, flat handles, which makes
them difficult to hold," Dr. Lewkowicz said. "Because of the contours and the
rubber panels on this one, you can grip it even if your hands are wet and
slippery."

Dr. Lewkowicz is executive vice president of the Ranir/DCP Corporation of
Orange, N.J., a company that makes generic dental products sold under the names
of chain stores and pharmacies. The company has shipped 250,000 brushes under
its own name and store labels since Labor Day, he said.

The brush has other uses. "It makes a fine utility brush and is super for
cleaning golf balls," Dr. Lewkowicz said.

Patent 5,465,449 was assigned to Ranir/DCP.

Keyboards For Kids

Computer keyboards for children these days come in all shapes and colors. "There
are a lot out there," said Richard Kuhlenschmidt, a former art dealer who has
just patented a keyboard. "But they are either adult keyboards with color
randomly added or they are proprietary to a certain game and can't be used for
anything else."

His keyboard is the same size and layout as most adult keyboards but the keys
themselves are 50 percent larger and the letters and numbers are written in a
big bold typeface that fills much of the surface of a given key. Letter keys are
bright yellow, number keys red, function keys green, and all other keys blue.

"I picked the colors so there would be as much contrast as possible so kids
could distinguish between different types of keys," Mr. Kuhlenschmidt said. "The
larger surface area of the keys makes it easier for a child to hit the right
one."

Mr. Kuhlenschmidt has replaced the number pad of the keyboard with an enlarged,
square cursor pad split into four triangles, each with an arrow pointing in the
appropriate direction.

"Most cursor keys are just not intuitive, and this is," he said.

Mr. Kuhlenschmidt, who is trying to license his invention, received patent
5,452,960.

Patents are available by number for $3 from the Patent and Trademark Office,
Washington, D.C. 20231.

The Wizard hits spot;
DRINKS

BYLINE: John Lewis

SECTION: GOOD TASTE; Pg. 35

LENGTH: 629 words


What does a tennis racquet and wine have in common? John Lewis finds out.

A WINE, an Australian Wimbledon singles victory and a failed tennis racquet tree
plantation in Tasmania are the ingredients of this story.

It unfolded after I received a bottle of the Holm Oak 2010 The Wizard Pinot Noir
from Rebecca and Tim Duffy's Holm Oak operation at Rowella, 40 kilometres north
of Launceston, in northern Tasmania.

The wine, which is reviewed today, is the second vintage of the marque and gets
its name from The Wizard tennis racquet used by Australia's Jack Crawford when
he won Wimbledon in 1933.

The racquet was made by the Alexander Patent Racquet Co in Launceston using
imported English ash.

Rebecca Duffy tells me the Holm Oak property was once owned by Alexander North,
a prominent Tasmanian architect, who was on the board of the Alexander racquet
company.

North decided to plant oak and ash trees on his land with the aim of supplying
wood for Alexander racquets. He was also involved in planting a larger English
ash plantation at Hollybank, near Lilydale, in Tasmania's north-east.

Sadly the wood from Holm Oak didn't meet the standards required and Hollybank
also proved a failure because the trees were planted too close together.

The Alexander factory on the corner of Abbott and Wentworth streets, Launceston,
no longer operates. In the 1930s and 1940s, however, it prospered making not
only tennis racquets, but cricket bats, badminton and squash racquets,
furniture, wooden bicycle rims and, during World War II, ammunition boxes.

Although its tree-growing experiment failed, the Holm Oak property took a
promising new turn in 1983, when the then owners established a small pinot noir
and cabernet sauvignon vineyard. These vines produced the first Holm Oak wines
in 1987 and in 1991 riesling vines were added to the mix.

In 2004 Rebecca Duffy's father, Ian Wilson, a King Island farmer, and her mother
Robyn, an island estate agent, bought the property.

Under Wilson family ownership, Rebecca made her first Holm Oak wines in 2007.

Born on King Island and schooled in Launceston, Rebecca tried her hand as a
cheesemaker on King Island, but quickly decided that wine was a far better
choice.

After graduating from the University of Adelaide wine science degree course, she
worked at South Australia's Tatachilla winery at McLaren Vale and in
California's Napa Valley.

From there she went in 2001 to Western Australia's Capel Vale wine company as
assistant winemaker, later rising to senior winemaker.

In 2006, Rebecca left WA to take charge of Holm Oak winemaking while her
husband, viticultural agronomist Tim Duffy, took on management of the
10.4-hectare Holm Oak plantings of arneis, chardonnay, merlot, cabernet franc,
cabernet sauvignon, pinot noir, pinot gris, riesling and sauvignon blanc.

Tim also oversees his parents' vineyard in Victoria's Swan Hill area that
provides the muscat a petits grains grapes used to make the distinctive Holm Oak
Moscato wines.

Rebecca and Tim, the parents of two young sons, have proved themselves expert
and innovative producers, with riesling, arneis and pinot noir. Rebecca believes
the 600-litre, $6000 seamless oval concrete fermentation vessel creates
different temperature layers, producing a vortex that keeps the lees in
suspension. The lees contain lots of dead yeast cells that over time break down
and create wines of rich creamy textures.

Rebecca matured 20 per cent of the current-release $30 Holm Oak 2012 Chardonnay
for eight months in the Nomblot and is well-pleased with the results.

They have introduced a French-made Nomblot egg to their winery and along with
the $25 2012 Riesling and 2012 Arneis, the $22 Ilex Pinot Noir, the $32 Pinot
Noir and the $60 2010 The Wizard Pinot Noir are available at
holmoakvineyards.com.au.

Streetscapes/The Racquet & Tennis Club;
A Park Ave. Anomaly Dedicated to Arcane Sports

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER GRAY

SECTION: Section 11; Page 6; Column 1; Real Estate Desk

LENGTH: 1253 words


IT'S an architectural Alamo, a masonry Park Avenue holdout now almost completely
surrounded by glass and steel buildings. Now the 1918 Racquet & Tennis Club,
between 52d and 53d Streets, home to some of the most arcane sports in the
world, is embarking on a restoration program, caused in part by the loss of some
melon-sized chunks from its terra-cotta cornice.

The Racquet & Tennis Club was established under that name in 1890 and next year
built a clubhouse at 27 West 43d Street. The club grew out of century of
organizations dedicated to the game of racquets -- a contest similar to squash
-- and dates back to the late medieval game of court tennis.

Barely two decades after the clubhouse was completed, members complained that
tall buildings blocked the light on the skylit racquet courts. In 1916 its board
of managers decided to move to Park Avenue and 52nd Street.

Park Avenue, especially the section just above Grand Central Terminal, was by
then developing as a first-class apartment house thoroughfare. In moving, the
club accepted an offer from Robert W. Goelet, a member, to build a clubhouse and
lease it to the club for a long term.

Goelet, the heir to a multimillion-dollar real estate fortune, tended to use the
architectural firm of Warren & Wetmore for his building projects; perhaps
someone else arranged for McKim, Mead & White to get the commission. The board
of managers included Harry Payne Whitney, Nicholas Biddle, Charles Scribner and
Ogden Mills.

Unlike the old cramped side-street site, the architects had a 200-foot frontage
to play with on Park Avenue, opening on a wide planted parkway street. They came
up with a solid, but elegant, brick-and-limestone design out of Renaissance
Florence, with a wide loggia at the second floor and upper floors almost without
windows, concealing the squash, racquet and court tennis playing areas.

In the frieze under the cornice they used models of their most distinctive game
equipment. According to Gerard J. Belliveau Jr., the club librarian, the longer
one is used for racquets -- a bat, according to game terminology; the slightly
shorter racquet is a court tennis racquet.

The central entryway originally gave both onto Park Avenue and, to the rear,
onto an elegant private driveway, which was later devoted to trash storage and
deliveries. On the second floor there is now a billiard room, lounge, library,
bar and restaurant and, at the center, a lounge leading out onto the loggia.

Sports take over on the third floor, with a centrally placed gym, a pool and
steam rooms on the north and a vast changing room on the south. Although not
decorated in the conventional sense, the changing room is one of the best club
rooms in New York -- rich, dark, antique, with open changing alcoves in dark
wood surrounding comfortable chairs and couches. There is no better place for an
afternoon nap in New York.

ON the fourth and fifth floors what is really special about the Racquet Club is
on display. On the south end are two court tennis courts, something like indoor
tennis courts but with some odd angles and sloping walls. Court tennis involves
rebounds off all four walls, changing boundaries, second chances and other
arcane rules more like chess than regular tennis.

At the north end there were originally two courts for racquets, but one was made
into squash courts several decades ago. The remaining racquets court is about
three times the size used for squash, with black walls and a high spectators'
gallery; most of the hardwood benches there, even though high above the court,
carry dents from the hard, golf-sized ball.

Edward F. Ulmann, a 10-time national racquets doubles champion on the club's
board of managers, calls racquets "the most difficult and fastest game in the
world."

It was apparently not all competition. In 1922 Rene LaMontagne, polo player and
club member, was arrested as a major figure in a bootlegging ring after reports
about a Racquet Club bachelor party reached Prohibition authorities. LaMontagne
was charged with selling 16,000 gallons of rye, 316 cases of Scotch, 500 cases
of gin, 9,000 gallons of wine and other spirits.

LaMontagne was sentenced to four months in prison, presaging a general
Prohibition crackdown on elite organizations previously thought to be
invulnerable. In January 1923 the club's 60-foot-long bar, called "Old Mahogany"
(it had been moved from the old clubhouse) was removed and orange juice became
the drink of choice -- or so The New York Herald reported.

Goelet died in 1941. The next year the club bought the building from the estate
just before the wave of office building construction turned Park Avenue below
59th Street from limestone apartment houses to modernist office buildings. In
his 1964 book, "Racquet & Tennis Club: Some History and Some Memories," George
Mead Rushmore noted that the change had increased interest in the club, not
necessarily for the better.

He wrote that there were now many applications from businessmen in the area who
simply "think of the club as a place to eat -- or worse, as a nice place to
bring in customers for lunch."

In the late 1970's the club was the scene of another contest, perhaps the
biggest game of real estate "chicken" ever played in New York. The Fisher
Brothers acquired the midblock site behind the Racquet Club for a new office
building, erected as Park Avenue Plaza. The developers approached the club about
a possible entrance through its building, but no deal was consummated.

AS reported by the late C. Ray Smith in New York magazine in 1978, some Racquet
Club members -- led by Jonathan Morse, an architect -- saw that the Fishers were
going to profit from the views over their building, and came up with a plan for
a 38-story hotel on top of the club, which would substantially block the views
from the 44-story Park Avenue Plaza.

There remain many questions about the feasibility of such a project, but the
adjacent developers -- pressured by their prospective tenants -- took it
seriously enough to buy the club's air rights for $5 million.

Mr. Morse still won't say if the club was ready to build, or even could have
built, the hotel. "That's a secret I'm taking to my grave," he said. But he does
believe that the resulting delays helped the Fisher Brothers. "While we were in
negotiations," he said, "the real estate market revived, and the delay resulted
in much higher rents."

The Racquet Club was designated a Landmark in 1979, and the club has filed with
the Landmarks Preservation Commission for a restoration of its exterior masonry,
which has lasted better than that of most apartment houses its age.

At the same time, the club has rewritten history in some of its interior
changes, like marbleizing the massive columns in the second-floor lounge -- they
were originally white -- and staining some woodwork (originally painted) to give
a more baronial feeling.

Many private clubs have nice sports facilities in a social context, but the
sense of the Racquet Club is single-minded dedication to sport, principally
sports that are no longer popularly played.

But Mr. Morse, whose ideas promised such drastic changes to the Racquet Club, is
no longer a member. "I've gotten too old to play much and I've gotten much more
interested in the New York Yacht Club," on West 44th Street between Fifth and
Sixth Avenues, he said. He said he had no further ambitions in the club
development area. "All I do in the Yacht Club is sail and drink," Mr. Morse
said.

Tennis
  The International Tennis Federation has outlawed the controversial
 double-strung spaghetti rackets for at least the next year by adopting a
 rule yesterday in Stockholm that, for the first time, technically defines
 which racquets will be allowed in tournaments. The racquets outlawed are
 the ones that give players unfair advantage in ball spin - like the
 double strung racquets. . . Top seed Guillermo Vilas advanced
 effortlessly into the quarter-finals of the Swiss Open in Gstaad,
 Switzerland yesterday with a 6-4, 6-2 victory over David Carter of
 Australia. Jose Luis Clerc also advanced to the quarter-finals by downing
 Hans Kary of Austria 6-1, 7-5, and will meet Tom Okker of Holland. Vilas
 will face Switzerland's Heinz Gunthardt. John McEnroe struggled to a 7-5,
 4-6, 7-5 victory over Billy Martin in a three-hour quarter-final match
 yesterday at the 300,000 round-robin Forest Hills Invitational in New
 York. He will meet Wojtek Fibak in the semi-finals.

Football
  X-rays have confirmed that tight end Peter Dalla Riva of Montreal
 Alouettes suffered two broken metacarpal bones in his left hand Tuesday
 in a 17-10 loss to Ottawa Rough Riders of the Canadian Football League.
 Doctors will wait until swelling subsides to decide whether the hand
 needs wiring and, if it does not, Dalla Riva may be ready to return to
 action in two weeks. . . Three young men who want to join the Los Angeles
 Rams' cheerleading corps of beauties called The Embraceable Ewes, filed
 suit in Los Angeles yesterday alleging sex discrimination in not being
 accepted. The men did not attend the April tryouts. Rams' spokesman Jerry
 Wilcox said the team is not opposed to male cheerleaders and added that
 men may be added next year.
                                   Hockey
  Right-winger Danny Lucas confirmed yesterday in Sault Ste. Marie that he
 has signed a four-year contract with Philadelphia Flyers of the National
 Hockey League. The 6-foot-1-inch, 190-pounder scored 50 goals and 117
 points last season with the Greyhounds.
                                  Baseball
  Houston Astros placed pitcher Joaquin Andujar on the 21-day disabled
 list effective July 8. Andujar suffered a pulled hamstring muscle in a
 game with the Chicago Cubs on June 17 and has not pitched since then. To
 replace him, Astros recalled relief pitcher Oscar Zamora from their
 Charleston farm club. . . Reggie Jackson has filed a cross-complaint of
 harassment against a woman who earlier accused the Yankee star of
 striking her in a Manhattan movie theater after he refused her his
 autograph. Casandra Small claims that the blow caused scratches and back
 pains and forced her to go to hospital. . . San Diego Padres bullpen ace
 Rollie Fingers, major-league baseball leader in saves with 19, and
 California Angels' Dave LaRoche, are front runners in the Rolaids Relief
 Man Awards competition. Fingers has 38 points based on a 4-8 record to
 lead the National League. LaRoche is 6-3 with 13 saves for 35 points to
 top American League relievers. . . Texas Rangers have optioned Pat Putnam
 to Tucson of the Pacific Coast League and placed Sandy Alomar on the
 15-day disabled list with a strained back. Al Oliver and Juan Beniquez
 have taken their places on the roster, having just come off the disabled
 list. . . The California Angels put pitcher Chris Knapp on the
 disqualified list yesterday after he refused to appear for a game against
 the Toronto Blue Jays. He was slated to start the game but, because of
 contract problems with management, refused to appear.
                                   Boxing
  Light heavyweight Tommy Evans of Richmond, Calif., scored the biggest

 Ron Turcotte, who rode the famed Secretariat to horse racing's Triple
 Crown in 1973, was listed in stable condition at Long Island Jewish
 Hospital yesterday after being thrown from his mount in the eighth race
 at Belmont Park. Turcotte was aboard Flag of Leyte Gulf when his horse
 clipped the heels of Water Malone at the start of the $25,000 feature

 He reported a problem moving his legs.
                                   Soccer
  A top Australian soccer coach, who showed his players films of Nazi
 concentration-camp atrocities to give them a killer instinct, resigned
 yesterday in Sydney because of a public outcry about his tactics. Richard
 Alagich, the 32-year-old coach of the Sydney team Manly, used films of
 the shooting and mass burial of hundreds of Jews at the Auschwitz death
 camp to put his players in a game mood.
                                  Shooting
 Alf Mayer of Kitchener emerged a triple winner Wednesday at the Canadian
 small-bore rifle shooting championships in Kitchener. Mayer won the open
 crown in the 50-metre free rifle event, scoring 2,302 of a possible 2,400

 Calgary; Cpl. Dave Haines of Winnipeg and Cpl. Ralph Comeau of Gagetown,
 N.B., - won the Hamilton Leigh Challenge Cup after beating the Scottish
 division and the crack Ghurka rifles in a tie breaking reshoot. The
 Canadians scored 341/2 against 321/2 and 32 respectively.

A terrific trip: Malone brings home silver medal

BYLINE: NANCY MORGAN

SECTION: NEIGHBORHOOD TIMES; TENNIS; Pg. 22

Joan Malone is grateful she was persuaded to participate in this year's  Senior
Sports Classic. The long-time St. Petersburg resident captured a silver  medal
in the national event in Tucson, Ariz.

In fact, Malone was one of just four tennis players from Florida to medal  in
singles.

"I never wanted to travel outside of Florida to compete," said Malone,  76, "but
I am so glad now that I went."

Malone competed in the age 75-79 division among 30 women. The former high
school teacher won four rounds to reach the final against Charlotte Decker of
California.

"There was a large range of abilities in my division," Malone said. "The  first
couple of rounds weren't too bad and then I had a really tough semifinal  before
making it to the final."

Malone lost 6-2, 6-2 to Decker but was consoled that Decker once beat DoDo
Cheney of California, winner of more than 100 gold tennis balls for national
championships.

"Playing tennis is so invigorating," Malone said. "Once I moved to  Florida, I
used to go regularly after school to play tennis."

Malone moved from New York to St. Petersburg in 1969 and taught social  studies
and coached the boys and girls tennis teams at St. Petersburg High for  nearly
15 years. In 1984, the girls team won the high school state  championship.

"I played tennis when I was a kid, but when I was raising a family I gave  it up
for 25 years," Malone said. "When I moved to Florida, tennis was  everywhere."

Malone's love for tennis goes beyond her playing at the St. Petersburg  Tennis
Center. She is involved with the center's advisory committee and  volunteers in
teaching tennis to neighborhood kids ages 5-13. Richie Terrell,  a former high
school student of Malone and currently the teaching professional  at the center,
trained Malone and a core of other volunteers to teach in the  grassroots junior
program.

Malone's enthusiasm and support for tennis - particularly at the center -  was
recognized at this year's third annual Tennis Extravaganza when she was  awarded
the Linwood Lewallen Sportsmanship Trophy.

"There were lots of incredible matches and great players at the Senior  Games,"
Malone said. "It was such an inspiring experience to see 50- to  98-year-olds
competing in a variety of sports."

Malone also competed in mixed doubles with Harry Church but lost in the  second
round.

MEN'S PLAYOFF UPDATE: Innisbrook and the Vinoy each earned 3-2 wins in the
first round of the best-two-of-three playoffs for the Adult League Tennis 3.5
championship. Innisbrook, unbeaten in the regular season, beat the Racquet  Club
of St. Petersburg and the Vinoy downed East Lake Woodlands.

Saturday, the Vinoy hosts the Racquet Club and East Lake is at Innisbrook.

Countryside Country Club and the St. Petersburg Tennis Center each defeated
their opponents 4-1 in the 4.0 playoffs. Countryside topped the Racquet Club
and St. Petersburg beat East Lake.

Saturday, East Lake is at Countryside and St. Petersburg hosts the Racquet
Club.

The Racquet Club blanked Safety Harbor Spa 5-0 in the 4.5 division and  McMullen
edged Royal Racquet Club 3-2. Saturday, Royal hosts Safety Harbor and  McMullen
is at the Racquet Club.

WOMEN'S PLAYOFF UPDATE: East Lake defeated the Racquet Club 3-2 and  Seminole
Lake topped the Vinoy by the same score in the 3.5 playoff. The Vinoy  is at the
Racquet Club Saturday and Seminole hosts East Lake.

Paradise Island beat East Lake 3-2 and will host East Lake at the Treasure
Island Yacht and Tennis Club Saturday.

CENTURY CHAMPIONS: Walt Mazurek and Jeff Winkler defended their Century
Tournament title at the Renaissance Vinoy last month with a final win over  Paul
Lederman and Norm Ott. In all, 12 men's doubles teams competed.

Each team included two players whose combined ages were at least 100 years.  It
was the tournament's second year and was coordinated and directed by  Lederman,
director of tennis at the Vinoy.

BACK TO TENNIS: A unique format of one-to-one guidance and assessment by a
physical therapist and a tennis instructor will be presented from 10 a.m.-noon
June 22 at the Golda Meir/Kent Jewish Center in Clearwater. Better Body Tennis
Clinics include a small group clinic with skill supervision and problem  solving
and is available to all levels. To register, call 796-5559.

Popular racquet club closing after 35 years

BYLINE: John Cox, The Bakersfield Californian

SECTION: BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS

LENGTH: 442 words


Aug. 31--A different kind of foreclosure crisis is spelling the end of a popular
racquet club that has operated next to Beach Park for 35 years.

Friday is expected to be the last day of operation for What a Racket, a local
institution whose seven racquetball courts, squash court, weight rooms, lounge
area and other amenities have continued to attract some 300 active members.

Doomed by the former building owner's financial troubles, the three-employee
business has been reluctant to throw in the towel, if only because of what a
vacancy there will mean for the surrounding area.

"It's going to be an eyesore," said manager Julie Flanagan, who is organizing a
demonstration Tuesday in one final push for a deal that would allow the club to
continue operating while the bank that owns the property seeks a new owner.

Club members expressed disappointment over the situation. Some have been members
for a decade or more and would drop by on lunch breaks for a game or two.

"I'm gonna miss it," said 18-year member Raul Rojas, Bakersfield's public works
director. "It's been a very close-knit group of us that've been down there for a
long time."

Jennifer Blackwood, the marketing director at Bakersfield's Klassen Corp., said
some employees of the architecture and construction firm spent time there
regularly.

"We're sorry to see it go," she said.

Designated a fitness facility by the city because of its location, the building
has had different owners over the years. Between 1997 and 2007 it was owned by
Flanagan and her former husband, William.

The party they sold it to declared bankruptcy a few years ago. Although William
Flanagan was able to keep the club open, mortgage payments were not being made.
Connecticut-based lender UPS Capital Business Credit foreclosed in February.

UPS sued Flanagan earlier this month for some $25,000 in back rent, and the
business received an eviction notice about the same time. Flanagan's offers to
buy the building have been rejected.

Julie Flanagan said she wonders why there can't be some sort of arrangement made
that would allow them to stay open -- and continue keeping up maintenance on the
surrounding area -- until the building is sold.

"Everybody's just so upset that it has to close all of a sudden with no apparent
reason," she said.

Her best hope now is that the next owner will want to lease the building back to
the business. She said the real estate agent involved in the property's
marketing has suggested that may yet happen.

Navy coach featured at book signing

BYLINE: Tennis Doug Lamartin

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. B14

LENGTH: 605  words


John Officer, the men's tennis coach at the Naval Academy, will hold a free
seminar and book signing at the Annapolis Bookstore on Maryland Ave. tonight
from 7-9 p.m. Officer just published his new book, Discovering Your Passion: The
Path of the Spiritual Warrior, to help people achieve their full potential in
life.

"We all have a spiritual side and a warrior side. The spiritual side is based on
openness, forgiveness, and a state of calmness. The warrior side is based on a
get it done (no excuses) mentality," Officer said.

Officer has also developed a series of videos about tennis that are available
from OnlineSports.com.

Officer led his team through a rebuilding season last yearto its fourth Patriot
League title in a row. This year, Navy will return most of its starting lineup,
including four all-league players (Owen Bullard, Jeremy New, Nicholas Gutsche
and Marcus Rebersak). Zach Nicholson (Jr., Bowie).

Tennis Exhibition: Jamie Peterson, the tennis director at the Chartwell Golf and
Country Club, will participate in a charity tennis exhibition with Doug Neagle,
the head pro at Gibson Island and the women's tennis coach at Towson University,
at Chartwell on Jan. 22 at 2 p.m. The match is designed to raise awareness about
Cystic Fibrosis. Peterson is the current Men's 35 state champion and a former
board member of the USTA Maryland District, while Neagle is a member of the
Salisbury University Sports Hall of Fame for tennis, and he has been a tennis
coach at the Severn School and an assistant coach at UMBC and Navy. In the
morning, Peterson will offer three hours of clinics to club members after which
he will make a donation from the proceeds to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.

Counterfeit Rackets: The Racquet Sports Industry magazine reports that
counterfeit rackets are becoming a bigger problem for industry and players too.
The Tennis Industry Association estimates that legitimate manufacturers lose $30
million a year in global sales due to counterfeits. Fake rackets can also be
dangerous for players. Bad rackets will not work as well; they won't last as
long; and even more importantly, they might lead to an injury. Anyone who has
ever suffered from tennis elbow should not want to take a chance with a phony
racket. Since many fakes may look a lot like the real thing, the best indicator
may be a price that is too good to be true. A dirt cheap price for a new racket
should raise a red flag though. Also, if a racket does not feel right, an
authorized dealer should be able to tell if it is counterfeit. To report fakes,
go to the web site, tennisindustry.org/Alert/Racquet.cfm.

Tournament News: Robert Rider (Annapolis) won the finals of the Boys 12 Singles

TUCKER'S CHARITY TOURNAMENT MIGHT BRING BIG NAMES TO TOWN

BYLINE: Gregg Wong, Staff Writer

SECTION: SPORTS; Tennis; Pg. 13C

LENGTH: 884 words


Venus and Serena Williams. Bill Cosby. Maybe even Michael Jordan.

The first Trent Tucker Celebrity Pro-Am tennis tournament, scheduled for Sept.
18-19 at 98th Street Racquet Club in Bloomington, is shooting for the stars.

And, with any luck, some of the biggest names in tennis, other sports and the
entertainment world will participate in the event, which will be a fund-raiser
for the multicultural tennis program of the USTA Northern Section, the proposed
Fred and Ellen Wells youth tennis facility in Minneapolis, Children's Hospital
and Clinics and the Make-A-Wish Foundation.

"We've got big hopes that a lot of these people will say yes," said Tony
Stingley, the Northern Section's director of multicultural tennis.

The event will be patterned after one started a few years ago by Joe Dumars of
the Detroit Pistons. Dumars brings many of the biggest names in sports to
Detroit for a fund-raising tennis event, one that will raise close to $1 million
this year for youth and minority programs in the Detroit area, Stingley said.

"We're hoping to raise $50,000 for our first year," Stingley said. "In time, we
hope to build up to what Dumars' event brings in."

Besides the Williams sisters, Cosby and Jordan, other big-name athletes or
former athletes who will be invited to participate are former Viking and current
NBC-TV announcer Ahmad Rashad; tour players MaliVai Washington and David
Wheaton; and former NBA stars Julius Erving, Mychal Thompson and Kevin McHale.

Those who have committed are the USTA's Rodney Harmon, Seattle SuperSonics
executive Billy McKinney, the Timberwolves' Micheal Williams, former Viking John
Henderson, WCCO-TV's Don Shelby, St. Paul Mayor Norm Coleman and, of course, the
host, Trent Tucker, a former Gophers and NBA star.

"If we can get the Williams sisters, it'd be great," Stingley said. "Trent is
calling Michael (Jordan) personally to extend an invitation. If he says yes,
it'd be unbelievable."

Others on Tucker's invitation wish list include Gophers men's basketball coach
Clem Haskins and local media celebrities Mark Rosen, Charlie Boone and Robyne
Robinson.

Preliminary plans call for a banquet Sept. 18 at either RiverCentre or the
Minneapolis Hilton. Teams for the next day's play will be auctioned off at the
banquet.

On Sept. 19, 16 celebrity doubles teams will compete. Play is intended to be
more for the fun of it and for the spectators than being an intense competition.

Revenue will come from ticket and sponsor sales, Stingley said. And volunteers
are being sought.

If you can help out or want more information, call Stingley at 887-5001.
Racket still illegal

Despite protests from many players and the manufacturer, the Northern Section is
abiding with the USTA ruling that the new Head titanium racket, the popular
Ti.S7, is illegal for tournament and league play.

The racket is illegal because its main strings measure 17 3/4 inches, or 2 1/4
inches longer than allowed by the Rules of Tennis administered by the
International Tennis Federation. The Ti.S5 and Ti.S6 are legal, by the way.

According to the Northern Section, if a player uses the Ti.S7 in a USTA match,
the opponent can protest at any time during the match, and the racket must be
replaced by a legal one. If the racket is used and the match is finished, the
result of the match would stand as played in good faith.

Head does have good news, though. The company's titanium rackets increased their
share of the racket market nationally by a whopping 10 percent (in dollars) for
the first quarter of 1998 over the first quarter of '97, according to Sports
Research Inc. That increase was accomplished at the expense of Wilson (down 8
percent) and Prince (down 2 percent).

Overall nationally, racket sales were down 10 percent from the first quarter of
1997. But the dollars were down only 3 percent because the average price of a
racket went up from $89.25 to $96.56.

Wilson, Prince and Head continue to dominate the racket market, selling about 85
percent of all frames for 90 percent of the sales dollars.

Drop shots

InnerCity Tennis' 10th annual fund-raising pro-am is July 20 at the Lafayette
Club on Lake Minnetonka.

ICT raises money for the Minneapolis Urban Tennis Program and other youth
programs.

The schedule calls for a pro-am at 2 p.m., exhibitions by ICT youths at 5 p.m.,
a courtside buffet dinner at 7 p.m. and an auction and raffle drawing at 8:30
p.m. The top raffle prize is a Labor Day weekend trip to New York and includes
airfare, three nights' lodging and U.S. Open and Broadway show tickets.

If you want to play, contribute or buy raffle tickets (only 200 will be sold at
$50 each), call 473-9200.

If you'll be in New York and can't get tickets to the Open, think about
attending the free-admission Open qualifying tournament Aug. 25-29, which also
is played at the National Tennis Center in Queens.

The qualifier has 128 draws for men's and women's singles, making it the
second-largest tournament in the country (after the Open itself), and offers
more than $1 million in prize money. Gregg Wong's tennis notebook appears on
Sundays. Send items of interest to him at the Pioneer Press sports department,

RACKETS; Vibrations, power keyed to equipment

SECTION: EXTRA; SECTION G; PAGE 07

LENGTH: 275 words


The last 20 years have seen sports equipment modernized in professional and
amateur use. However, none has changed as much as tennis equipment.

Tennis has run the gamut of technological improvement. Wooden rackets dominated
the 1960s, and "feel" was the buzzword for manufacturers. The introduction of
metal appeared next, followed by aluminum, graphite, fiberglass, magnesium and
composite frames that included mixtures of Kevlar, boron and ceramic fibers.

Today's buzzword is "power," and that brings into consideration a symptom
becoming prevalent, known as vibration.

With the introduction of oversized rackets and the new wider-profile frames,
power and vibration are concerns that need to be addressed.

A heavier frame will generate more power, have less vibration and have a larger
sweet spot. A frame that is more stiff will generate more power, transmit more
vibration to the arm and provide a uniform ball response over the entire racket
head. A frame that has a larger head will generate more power, have a larger
sweet spot and be more resistant to twist on off-center hits.

Today's rackets come in a variety of sizes and shapes. A few are midsize,
oversize, large-head and mid-plus. Some manufacturers measure the total square
inches of their racket heads from inside the frame, and others from the outside
perimeter.

Racket heads are oval, round, elliptical, octagonal, hexagonal and square. It is
easy to see how confusing the racket industry has become. If in doubt refer to
the above facts, all accepted by the U.S. Racquet Stringers Association, and
become educated on what kind of racket you have.

Science makes racquets better

SECTION: D; Pg. 4

LENGTH: 750 words

DATELINE: LINCOLN, NE


Scientific breakthroughs improve our quality of life in so many areas - health
care, communication, transportation and, of course, tennis.

Racquet technology is always evolving as companies strive to produce that
perfect stick that will raise everyone's game to Roger Federer's level without a
single case of tennis elbow or shoulder pain. And this year's line of racquets
is no different, according to Racquet Corner co-owners Bob and Ron Schultz.

A year ago, Prince introduced the O-Portal system in which the grommets - the
holes on the side of the frame that the string goes through - are much larger
than on conventional racquets.

Prince, the racquet of choice by Lincoln national junior champion Jack Sock,
started with two models using the O-Portal technology, but has expanded it to
five this year. The company has also added a Hybrid frame that uses both smaller
and larger grommets.

"Prince says the O-Portal system makes the sweet spot larger by 54 percent," Ron
Schultz said. "People who use it say they can feel the difference."

Head has added another component to its line of Liquidmetal racquets - the
Flexpoint. The racquet flexes more in the head area, allowing the ball to stay
on the strings longer for added control.

The Liquidmetal technology went the opposite direction when it was introduced
two years ago. That frame does not deform on impact, producing 29 percent more
power than the company's  previous racquets.

"I guess they needed the Flexpoint to curb the power," Bob Schultz said.

While Federer has been the world's No. 1 player for three years, at least Andy
Roddick can lay claim to the No. 1 racquet. The Babolat Pure Drive he's played
with since going professional in 2000 has been the world's best-selling racquet
the last three years.

He's now playing with a new model of that frame - the Pure Drive Roddick. While
it hasn't improved his results this year, his arm should be feeling better. "It
has a cortex system to dampen frame vibration, and it seems to work," Ron
Schultz said.

Wilson apparently is satisfied with its N-Code technology, which it introduced a
few years ago. That's still the cornerstone of their racquet line. Wilson
describes it as "nano-sized silicone oxide crystals that permeate the voids
between the carbon fibers in the frame" to add stability.

It's certainly worked for Federer, although Ron Schultz says the model that the
world's No. 1 player uses is not for the average player.

"It's only 90 square inches and it's heavy," Ron Schultz said. "It takes a good
player to play with it."

COURT UPDATE

By June, it appears there will be 24 new outdoor courts available to Lincoln
tennis players. University of Nebraska Campus Recreation Associate Director Bill
Goa expects the six courts at the Harper-Schramm-Smith Complex and the six on
East Campus to be ready by the end of next month, if the weather cooperates.

Both sites are ready for the plexipave top coat surface to be applied since the
post-tension concrete at Harper-Schramm-Smith and the asphalt base at East
Campus have already been laid. The courts at Harper-Schramm-Smith will be the
same color blue as the courts at the U.S. Open.

"The aggregate temperature has to be above 50 degrees to lay down the surface,
so we need to wait a little just to be safe," Goa said.

Both UNL sites will have new lighting. Goa says the Harper-Schramm-Smith
lighting will be better than what was installed at the NU Varsity Courts two
years ago. "We'll have the latest in Musco (lighting) technology," Goa said.
"These will be the best-lit courts in Lincoln."

The 12 new outdoor courts at the Abbott Sports Complex's Nebraska Tennis Center
are on a similar completion schedule as the NU courts.

The seven concrete courts at Lincoln East were slated to be plexipaved last
summer. That project now appears dead, however, because of a lack of funds,
according to Lincoln Public Schools athletic director Karen Hand.

NU COED TEAM GETS BID

Nebraska's first-year coed club team has received an at-large bid into the
United States Tennis Association  Team Tennis National Campus Championships. The
64-team event will be April 20-22 in Austin, Texas, at the 40-court Whitaker
Tennis Center just off the University of Texas campus.

Four schools from the Missouri Valley section advanced to nationals - Iowa
State, Washington University, Missouri-Rolla and NU. Iowa State defeated
Washington in the sectional finals in February in Des Moines to earn the
automatic bid.

 Title: Resisting Protection? Variations in Forms of Resistance to Protection
Rackets



 Abstract: Do the victims of protection rackets resist?

Existing research on protection rackets emphasizes two key dimensions: supply
and demand. Criminal organizations supply the use and threat of violence as part
of offering business firms protection, while the latter demand these commodities
in contexts of state absence or weakness. Securing the cooperation of firms is
central to the sustainability of the protection racket. Yet, relatively little
research theorizes if and how the victims of protection rackets might resist. I
find that not only does resistance to protection rackets occur, but that it can
also assume sharply contrasting forms. To explain this variation I construct a
political economy framework focused on the economic and political resources that
victims mobilize to mount resistance. I illustrate the framework's analytic
utility by using it to explain striking empirical variation in cases of
resistance in Medellin (Colombia), Ciudad Juarez (Mexico), San Miguel (El
Salvador), and Michoacán (Mexico). While some victims publicly contested
domination under protection rackets, others engaged in comparatively subtler
practices to negotiate the terms of their domination without bringing about the
racket's demise. Some victims resisted by coordinating with the state through
formal institutional channels; others established private armed groups to weaken
and eliminate rackets. And still others coordinated with the state but through
informal channels that advanced extra-judicial violence. The empirical analysis
demonstrates that a focus on resource endowments can help us to make sense of
such puzzling variation in forms of resistance and advance our knowledge of
criminal politics in the developing world.

Scientists get a handle on an improved racquet grip

BYLINE: MCNAMARA P

LENGTH: 572 words


The face of tennis, or in this case the handle, has been changing dramatically
in the past 15 years.

Dr Frank Katch, chairman of the science department at the University of
Massachusetts, has helped invent a handle that has six sides instead of the
conventional eight.

Research conducted by his department claim the six-sided handle gives a 14 per
cent improvement in forehand swings and 9 per cent in backhand swings.

According to Dr Katch, gripping the octagonal handle of a conventional racquet
automatically changes the orientation of the palm to the racquet face by about
six degrees.

"People have been doing this for decades, assuming the octagonal handle gives
the optimal grip, but analysis of wrist and racquet angles with a powerful
computer shows that is not the case," said Dr Katch.

The handle was designed by mathematician Andrew Brown and according to Dr Katch
it gives a huge improvement in the performance of players of all levels.

"For every 100 shots it would mean an average of 14 more accurate and more
powerful forehand shots than a traditional racquet and nine more backhand," he
said.

"I believe it could make the difference between winning and losing." Dr Katch
also claimed that further tests at a university in New Orleans showed that the
six-sided racquet could relieve widespread problems of tennis elbow.

As I have yet to use the new handle I cannot comment on it, but it would be
interesting to try it out. With tennis so competitive these days you can be sure
someone will use the handle to try to gain an advantage.

The traditional forehand tennis grip is known as a continental grip, with your
hand placed straight down the face of the handle. But today that grip has been
superseded by the western grip, enabling players to get far more topspin on
their forehand ground strokes.

The makers of the new grip claim the racquet face becomes vertical at the moment
of impact, compared to the face tilting upwards at impact with the traditional
grip.

I tend to be suspicious until I have either tried the racquet or been proven
wrong. My mind goes back to the double-strung racquet produced by West German
Gunter Fischer.

Christophe Roger-Vasselin reached the semi-finals of the 1983 French Open using
such a racquet and Ille Nastase won two tournaments with it.But it only lasted
just on a year before being banned, as it was deemed to give too big an
advantage for topspin.

Guillermo Vilas and I had a hit with the double-strung racquets in France and
could not believe what could be achieved with it in regard to topspin. Since I
did not rely on topspin, it did not affect my game dramatically, but Vilas, who
was a topspin master, became unbeatable.

The bounce he could get with the racquet meant some balls were clearing my head,
making them unplayable.

With tennis becoming so hi-tech, it does not surprise me that the new grip idea
is being put forward.After all, 20 years ago no one had heard of a graphite or
composite racquet.

I do not think there is one ranked player who uses an all wooden racquet today
and most prefer the profile racquets with wider bodies.

As for the new handle, I look forward to testing it in the near future, even if
I do have reservations because standardisation of tennis equipment has gone out
the window in recent years.

In cricket everyone has a standard set of equipment and that is the way it
should be.

Wang takes net measurement to new heights

BYLINE: SUSAN BIDDLE JAFFEE

SECTION: CITY TIMES AND INDEPENDENT; tennis; Pg. 7

LENGTH: 667 words



From the wires, word comes from Lowell, Mass., that Wang    Laboratories Inc. -
the other big computer people - has developed the    perfect tennis aid for
players who insist that it is the net's fault    whenever a shot falls short.

      Actually, the idea and design belongs solely to avid tennis player    An
Wang, chairman and chief operating officer of the multibillion    dollar
computer manufacturer.

     Unlike his predecessors in the field of tennis net height measuring    -
there have been at least six others who have tried to market a    net-measuring
device - Wang's idea is simply an update of the    traditional method, which
called for one racket to be placed on end and    another above it widthwise. The
combination of a traditional racket's    length, 27 inches, and its width, 9
inches, gave players a yardstick of    sorts that could easily determine if the
height of the net was at its    standard 36 inches or not.

     But the advent of oversized racket heads and    less-than-traditionally
shaped rackets made life on the court a little    more complicated. Simply put,
Wang has 'invented' a series of marks    that can be placed on the strings and
handle of any racket to indicate    the proportions of the traditional-size
racket. By using two rackets    with Wang's markings, players can once again
quickly measure the height    of the net.

     Can't say if it will really help, but then, it can't hurt.





      The 1987 international junior rankings are out and, from the    looks of
it, Florida's Jim Courier is the next great American hope.

     While Australia's Jason Stoltenberg and Soviet Union star Natalia
Zvereva topped the International Tennis Federation's list, Dade City's
Courier led the Americans by finishing No. 4. David Wheaton, the only    other
American in the top 10, was ranked 7th. The highest ranking    American girl was
Ann Grossman, who placed No. 22.

     According to John Treleven, administrator of junior programs for    the
ITF, the absence of American girls from the girls top 20 reflects    no lack of
talent among American juniors, but rather the fact that many    of the best
young American players are already playing professionally,    and that those
younger players still in junior competition play only a    limited number of
tournaments due to school commitments.

     ITF rankings are based on its 106 sanctioned annual junior events.





   In its February issue, Tennis magazine ranks its own picks for 1987    on
everything from the best faces of the year to the best players.

 Included in the magazine's pick of its 14 Collegiate All-American    All-Star
team members are three Florida players. Picked for the team    were Cathy
Goodrich (Florida), Ronnie Reis (Miami) and Pat Emmet    (Rollins).





   For the third year, the Eckerd Drug Co. will sponsor the Eckerd    World
Class Challenge in eight cities in the Southeast and Southwest.

 Winners of each regional tournament will then be flown to Largo to    compete
in the Grand Finale on March 19-20. On the line is a wild-card    spot in the
32-player main draw of the $ 200,000 Virginia Slims Eckerd    Tennis Open, which
gets under way March 28 in Largo.

     In addition to the two-day regional competition, Eckerd will    sponsor a
youth tennis clinic in each of the eight challenge cities for    junior players
ages 5-18.

     Locally, both the World Class Challenge and free clinic will be    held at
the Bardmoor-Stearns International Tennis Centre in Largo.

 Dates of the Tampa challenge are Feb. 27-28. The free clinic is    scheduled
for Feb. 28 at 1 p.m. Entry forms for the Tampa World Class    Challenge are
available at Eckerd stores.

When it comes to restringing their tennis rackets, Chicago Midtown Tennis Club
members know that pro shop staffer David Perez works the polyester strings like
a guitar virtuoso.

"I like the look in someone's eyes when I hand their racket back," Perez said of
his clients' gratitude. "They act as if they're holding a brand new tennis
racket."

Of the 343 Master Racquet Technicians nationwide, the Des Plaines resident is
one of only six professional stringers in Illinois who has attained this
distinguished United States Racquet Stringer Association certification.
Supported by the biggest racket manufacturers worldwide -- including Wilson,
Babolat, Head, Dunlop and Prince --the master credential separates the amateur
from the professional stringer.

"This just isn't a place where we go after school," said Perez, who strings
about 75-80 rackets a week in the pro shop for Midtown club members. "This is
where we spend our life."

According to Perez, while most sporting goods stores have staff that can
reasonably string a racket, players who are serious about improving their tennis
game know that a skilled pair of hands can make all the difference.

"Some technicians simply install strings," said Perez, who has been stringing
rackets for 13 years. "But an MRT actually works with a player to tailor the
strings and string tension to their skill set."

Time and frequency of play are two major factors that cause strings to lose
their effectiveness. The rule of thumb, he says, is to restring as many times in
a year as you play in a week. Stringing prices at Midtown range from $24-$58.

With so many rackets and strings from which to choose, Perez is frequently
approached for advice. He suggests first taking time to select the right racket,
and then concentrating on finding the right string.

There are currently about 600 different varieties of strings offered -- from
natural "gut" (produced from cow intestines) and synthetic gut, to polyester,
nylon, and (bulletproof) Kevlar. String tensions typically vary from 44-68
pounds. (Tennis pro Roger Federer prefers rackets strung between the high 40s
and low 50s. Former pro Monica Seles, similarly, cranked up her strings to 92
pounds.)

"Typically, selecting a string is done through trial and error," explains Perez.
"However, with the right expertise and guidance, the process can be shortened
significantly."

Each string has its own characteristics and benefits. The tighter the tension,
the more control. Looser string tensions, similarly, offer you more power. The
master technician's biggest challenge, he added, is to match a player's racket
not only with the right string, but the right string tension.

"It's about finding the lowest string tension that you can control," said Perez

For him, consistency day in and day out is the key. The sophisticated Wilson
Baiardo stringing machine on which he works memorizes each Midtown stringer's
personalized settings to maintain consistency.

Midtown pro shop manager Lynda Reis sees firsthand how Perez's expertise and
personalized care makes the difference for Midtown members.

"David is exceptional at what he does. He gives it his heart and soul," she
says. "He wants your racket to work for you," Weis adds. "That's what he brings
to our shop."

TENNIS If you're in need of a new racket, try out a few models at pro shop

BYLINE: Rod Carlyletennis

SECTION: EXTRA; Section J; Page 5

LENGTH: 681 words


Many people are in the process of possibly changing rackets now that Spring ALTA
season is over. The biggest problem they encounter is where to start, given the
vast number of models available, and the multitude of configurations that they
are confronted with when searching the racket displays in the shops.

With the many different shapes, sizes and materials available in rackets today,
how do consumers make sure they select the best model? With the prices of
rackets today, this does become a major concern. No one wants to pay $ 200 for a
racket and strings and then discover a week later they can't hit with it.

If you find yourself in this position, the best plan probably is to go to your
favorite tennis shop and discuss your situation with the racket specialist. Ask
for the racket expert and tell this person you need guidance.

In most cases you will be questioned about your situation, such as how often you
play, what type of game you play, etc. Upon evaluating your particular
situation, the racket specialist will be able to recommend a general class of
rackets for you to try.

Now comes what is the most important step for you - testing various models. This
is a must if you are to select the best choice. Be prepared to try several
rackets over a period of time in order to get the feel of the different models.
Also be prepared to pay for this, but you most likely will be able to work out
an agreement with the shop to have this money refunded upon purchase of your new
racket.

Upon checking with some of the area's shops, a normal situation you may be
confronted with is a daily charge of around $ 3. Make up your mind before you
start that you will try each racket for a couple of days and then return and try
another.

The better shops offer refunds on demo charges of up to 30 days. This will give
you plenty of time to test several models. You should be able to narrow your
preferences down to two or three models after a couple of weeks.

Go back and try these again to come to your final decision. What most shops will
do is subtract the demo fees from the price of the racket you purchase. Even
though this plan will take a period of weeks and many trips to the shop, you
will have the confidence that your selection was the right one and won't be as
likely to suffer buyer's remorse a few days later.

One very important point to remember is not to make your choice on what your
friends, pro or favorite player uses. Just because they play great with a
particular model does not ensure that you will. Every person hits the ball
differently, so each person will get different results from each racket.

With all the different models, shapes and sizes available, what are today's
players choosing? According to Dale Queen, owner of Your Serve, men and women
are going in different directions.

The oversize (120 square inches) and wide-bodies are the preference of most
women. The added size of these models give more power and offer more forgiveness
than their predecessors.

Queen says the trend among men is different. One of the reasons is the change in
the definition of the term midsize. It used to mean 90, but many manufacturers
are now making their midsize rackets 100 square inches. Many men find the
wide-bodies gave them too much power. The trend is to the 100-square-inch racket
faces that are also not as wide as the wide-bodies, but are wider than the
conventional frames of past years.

Racket technology is constantly changing. This process will continue as each
company tries to get an edge on the competition. Don't let this keep you from
going ahead and purchasing a new model if you need one. It takes awhile to
perfect new advances and for the players to adapt to changes. A miracle advance
will not antiquate your selection overnight, but keep abreast of changes so that
the next time you are in the market, you will again know what to demo before
purchasing.

McMullen, Racquet Club capture senior men's titles

BYLINE: NANCY MORGAN

SECTION: LARGO TIMES; TENNIS; Pg. 4

LENGTH: 1080 words



As the USA League Tennis senior division concluded, the adult program served up
action last weekend.

Despite blustery winds and inclement weather, the two remaining senior men's
division winners were determined. McMullen of Clearwater captured the 4.0 title,
and the Racquet Club of St. Petersburg won its second consecutive 3.5 district
championship.

McMullen claimed the 4.0 doubles league crown with a 2-1 win over Seminole Lake
Tennis Center.

McMullen's Scott Chambers and David Heeder defeated Tim Kahle and Harold Kligman
6-2, 7-6 in the No. 1 position, and Seminole responded with Leo Leonardi and
Larry Daum beating Peter Viggiano and Eric Watson. Doug Godinho and captain
Wendall Walker won the deciding match for McMullen with a 6-3, 6-4 decision over
Ron Klieve and Mauro Rodriquez.

"Our No. 1 won fairly easily, and their No. 3 won fairly quickly," Walker said.
"In our match, we got the edge and were able to keep it.

"Two years ago, some on this team went all the way to nationals," he said.
"Early on, we got the bug to be competitive all the way, and we're hoping we can
be."

A 7-0 regular-season record advanced the Racquet Club to the district playoffs.

The Racquet Club beat Feather Sound Country Club 3-0 in the first round. A 2-1
victory over Phil Green Tennis Academy moved the Racquet Club to the final with
East Lake Woodlands, which had eliminated a second Racquet Club team and the
Royal Racquet Club.

The Racquet Club won last weekend 3-0.

The adult division started last weekend for 39 women's teams and 36 men's
squads.

The women's 3.5 division is the largest with 18 in three flights, followed by
4.0 with 10, 3.0 with five, 4.5 with three and one 5.0 team.

East Lake's 3.0 women have advanced to state three times. This year's squad,
said captain Pam Wenglasz, has just five returning players.

"We lost some players because they moved up a level and some moved away,"
Wenglasz said. "Also, some decided not to play."

The men's division began last week for 15 teams in 3.5, eight in 4.0, five in
3.0, six in 4.5 and two in 5.0.

"There will be some intense competition in all the divisions, and especially in
the 4.5," coordinator Clark Higgs said. "Two of the favorites in the 4.5 will be
the Phil Green Tennis Academy at Safety Harbor Spa and McMullen.

"Last year, those two came down to a tie-breaker to determine the district
winner. I suspect it may be the same way this season."

The second year of the national organization's Tennis Link has been
well-accepted, said Higgs, second-year men's coordinator. Players are enjoying
easy access to the league's match results.

"It's really convenient for everyone and not limited to just the captains
recording scores on the website," Higgs said. "Anyone with a USTA membership
number can access it."

While the senior champions wait for the state tournament, scheduled for May, the
adult league continues play through May.

FIGHTING CANCER: More than $ 28,000 will be directed to the local American
Cancer Society as a result of the 19th ACS Tennis Classic.

Despite the three-day event being reduced to one day with make-ups during the
week, men's, women's and mixed doubles teams battled for bragging rights while
helping in cancer research.

The majority of the matches have been completed, with a few championships and
consolation finals yet to be played.

Capturing women's titles were Sharon Garibold and Terri Schweiger (3.0) and
Donna Bleakley and Lauren Coogan (3.5). The men's doubles champs were John
Gelestor and Larry Nickerson (3.5), Jamie Vetter and Ron Bedlack (4.0) and
Albert Alhadeff and Sam Lancred (4.5).

Dori and Mitchem Regalski won the 3.0 mixed, Mickie and John Gelestor 3.5 and
Karen Brenneman and Jerry Kelly 4.0.

LEAGUE UPDATES: A playoff Sunday between Bardmoor Golf and Tennis Club and Royal
Racquet Club will decide the district senior mixed 7.5 champion. Both teams
finished the regular season with a 7-1 record - each with a loss to the other -
and will meet at Royal Racquet Club to determine the qualifier for the state
tournament in April.

 East Lake Woodlands leads the five-team women's Suncoast Singles League. East
Lake has 28 points, followed by Bardmoor (27), Vinoy II (23), Vinoy I (16) and
St. Petersburg Country Club (12).

 The Phil Green Tennis Academy (5-0) heads the four-team super senior 3.5 north
division. In the south, Shipwatch Tennis Club is 5-0 and St. Petersburg Tennis
Center is 5-1.

At the conclusion of the regular super senior men's season this month, a playoff
between the top south and north  squads will determine which advances to the
state tourney in May.

In the super senior 3.5 women's division, Innisbrook and Bardmoor are tied at
2-1.

TOURNEY NOTES: Finalists in the Winter Wonders Championships in Clearwater
included Morgan Frank (16), Yuri Kurashima (18), Kara Kucin (10), Alex Gillott
(boys 16), Phillip Barlow (14) and Zachary Bandes (10). Ariana Zayac (10) and
Kirk Kucin (boys 12) were consolation winners. Barlow was a finalist in the 16
division of last weekend's Seminole Winter Classic.

 Garrett Betsarakis upset the No. 2 seed in a boys 10-and-under division
semifinal, advancing to the championship of the Arbor Greene Junior Super Series
in Tampa. When the No. 3 seed was unable to play in the final, Betsarakis was
named the winner. Nicholas Berning and Justin Herzig reached the 14 doubles
championship, and Kelly Nelson made it to the girls 18 final.

 Reinaldo Valor collected two men's 55-and-over titles - one in the Treasure
Island Super Seniors 2002 and the other in the St. Petersburg Country Club Super
Senior Championships. Other TI event winners were Dave Krebs (65), Bob Allen and
Andy Chau (75 doubles) and Tom Avirett and Don Wray (80). Bud Steckman won the
75 singles consolation. At SPCC, Krebs netted a second 65 crown and the doubles
with Al Blackburn. Bob Meyerdierks (75) and Jim Vuille (90) captured titles with
straight-set victories. John Rensch and Rich Boddicker defeated Doug Wood and
Rob Royden in the 55 doubles.

COMING UP: The Super Seniors Invitational - for men in singles and doubles in
the 55-and-over, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85 and 90 divisions - began Tuesday at
Seminole Lake Tennis Center and continues through Monday. Tennis competition in
the Goodlife Games begins Monday at Southwest Complex. Call Linda Kettell,

Acac Fitness & Wellness Centers opened its newest Baltimore-area health club
Monday inside Green Spring Racquet Club in Lutherville. Acac Green Spring on
Falls Road will allow racquet club and gym members to use both facilities.

Racquet club members will have access to exercise facilities, personal training
and group exercise classes such as yoga, Pilates and barre. Acac members will
have access to racquet sports and a cafe.

The fitness chain entered the Baltimore market in 2015, taking over two Maryland
Athletic Club locations in Timonium and Hunt Valley. The company also operates
two clubs in Pennsylvania and three in Virginia, and says it has more than
50,000 members. Besides fitness facilities, the clubs offer aquatics programs,
personal training, youth programs, corporate wellness and fitness for older
adults.

Ticketmaster purchases.

Customers who bought tickets through the company between Oct. 21, 1999, and Feb.
27, 2013, are eligible. The vouchers will expire in four years.

The voucher program is the result of a class-action lawsuit over ticket fees and
other charges.

Billboard magazine reports that about 50 million people are eligible to receive
the vouchers. Ticketmaster is now part of Beverly Hills-based Live Nation
Entertainment Inc.

Wave of color // Tennis whites, plain rackets fall out of favor as fashionable
players join trend toward hues

BYLINE: DARRELL FRY

SECTION: CITY TIMES AND INDEPENDENT; TENNIS; Pg. 12

LENGTH: 613 words

DATELINE: ST. PETERSBURG



ST. PETERSBURG - For the trend-conscious consumer, "tennis whites"    and
traditional equipment are staying in the closet. The latest styles    in tennis
call for colors, colors and more colors. And the rule seems    to be: the
brighter the better.

     As Americans follow the European lead this spring, everything from
rackets to clothes is painted in bright colors, with strings, grip    tapes and
other accessories to match.

     "Everything is moving toward colors," said Julie Demlow, account
supervisor for Doremus, Porter and Novelli, the New York-based
public-relations firm that represents Prince Manufacturing Inc.    "Almost every
company has introduced (a bright-colored racket)."

     Put on the back shelf are the mostly black graphite rackets that    were
the rage over the past few years. They gave way to the    still-popular white
ceramic rackets introduced last year by several    manufacturers. Now hitting
the market are rackets in red, yellow,    purple and even hot pink, with strings
and grip tape of the same    colors.

     "It's fashion and function," said Kathy Button, manager of public
relations for Wilson Sporting Goods, in River Grove, Ill. "We're    putting them
together.

     "Usually these trends begin in Europe. Over there, (the    bright-colored
rackets) are doing terrific, so we decided maybe we'd    try it over here."

     So far, Button said, the bright-colored rackets are selling "very    well
in the U.S. They're definitely the trend."

     One buyer said his sporting-goods chain looks to purchase only    rackets
and equipment with colors. "(Manufacturers) won't even bring    us any (rackets
without color), because they know we won't buy it,"    said Dale Thompson, an
assistant buyer for Robby's Sporting Goods.

     Likewise, brighter colors and designs in clothing are catching on.

 Clothing manufacturers known for their eye-catching colors and chic    designs
- Le Coq Sportif and Nike among them - are becoming even more    popular.
Conservative clothiers are turning up the hue.

     "Absolutely," Button said in assessing whether there is a trend    toward
bright colors in tennis clothes. "I think they were very    traditional before -
you know, plain sweat suits with no design. Now    they're becoming very
fashionable. It's the same with men's and women's    clothes."

     This new trend is less popular in some areas than in others. At one    St.
Petersburg store, the owner said the demand for the bright-colored    rackets
and equipment is only moderate.

     "This is a different market. It's more conservative," said Alice
Trombley of What A Racquet Sport Shop. Trombley said her store carries
colored equipment and clothing used by top professionals Yannick Noah    and
Johan Kriek and "it won't move at all."

     But in Tampa, bright-colored rackets, grip tapes and clothes crowd    the
displays in several sporting-goods stores.

     Even so, manufacturers, busy getting out their spring lines, admit    they
are uncertain how long the trend will last.

     "It may be just a slight trend," said Glen Marien, a Wilson sales
representative. "Several years ago we had the same trend in    basketball, and
it went away."

     Because several manufacturers are producing the bright-colored    rackets,
prices vary. At most area stores, the trendy rackets cost    between $ 100 and $
200, Thompson said.

PAT THINKS HE'S ONTO THE ULTIMATE RACQUET

SOURCE: QNP

BYLINE: AAPGROUP

LENGTH: 309 words


Pat thinks he's onto the ultimate racquet MILAN (Reuter)._ A new Japanese
racquet helped Pat Cash beat Spaniard Sergio Casal 6-3, 7-6 (7-5) to reach the
quarter-finals of the Italian indoor tennis championship. ""The more I play with
this racquet, the better I like it," said the world No 7 who is seeded second
here. ""I may be onto the ultimate racquet. I hope so." Cash began using the
Japanese model during Australia's successful Davis Cup tie against Mexico. His
other racquet contract had expired. ""I found a racquet with a good feel so I
thought, why not ask for a little more power as well," he said. ""I got it. What
more can you want out of a racquet? It's the most important piece of my kit."
Also through to the quarter-finals is top seed Boris Becker who was seeded to
meet Jimmy Connors in tomorrow's final. But Cash could easily upset plans. In
earlier play, third-ranked Miloslav Mecir beat Swede Jonas Svenssen 6-4, 6-0,
West German Carl-Uwe Steeb defeated fellow countryman Ricki Osterthun 7-6, 1-6,
7-5 and Milan Srejber (Czechoslovakia) outlasted Dutchman Michiel Schapers 3-6,
6-2, 6-2. In Oakland, California, top-seeded Martina Navratilova breezed to a
6-2, 6-0 win over Australia's Wendy Turnbull to advance to the quarter-finals of
the California women's tournament. Navratilova, ranked second in the world, used
her powerful serve-and-volley style to run off 12 consecutive games after
trailing 0-2 in the first set. Other seeds through to the quarter-finals were No
3 Hana Mandlikova (Czechoslovakia) and No 6 Natalia Zvereva (USSR). Mandlikova
beat South African Elna Reinach 6-7, 6-1, 6-1 while the 16-year-old Zvereva
toppled American Camille Benjamin 6-3, 6-2. PAT CASH blasts another winner past
Spain's Sergio Casal on his way to a quarter-finals berth in the Italian indoor
champs. Cash won 6-3, 7-6 (7-5).

IN BUSINESS;
Going for the Sweet Spot

BYLINE:  By DAN MARKOWITZ

SECTION: Section 14WC; Column 2; Westchester Weekly Desk; Pg. 3

LENGTH: 968 words

DATELINE: SCARSDALE


WHEN Madeline Hauptman talks about tennis racket design, a listener soon feels
as if a mathematics degree would come in handy. Words like "hypotenuse,"
"ellipses," "sine" and "co-sine" pepper her description of her search to find
just the right angle for each string to cross the others and enter a graphite
racket frame.

In fact Ms. Hauptman, a Scarsdale resident, has a graduate degree in mathematics
from the University of Pennsylvania. She also had tennis elbow, and experience
with tennis racket technology.

All of these factors combined to take her to the United States National Tennis
Center earlier this fall during the two-week run of the United States Open.
Along with Wilson, Head and Yonnex, Ms. Hauptman showed off her new design, a
racket called the PowerAngle.

"Day to night, our booth was packed with people wanting to know about our racket
," she said.

Ms. Hauptman and her business partner, David Luskin of Hawaii, came up with the
idea to string a racket diagonally, instead of perpendicularly. A third partner,
Dr. Alex Berenstein of Weston, Conn., is an investor and strategic planner in
the business.

The diagonal stringing pattern, according to the racket's brochure, "imparts
more spin, creates more power, and enables more ball control."

It goes on to say: "Impact and vibration are drastically reduced due to the
sweet spot strings being of equal length. The longer diagonal strings better
absorb the shock of the ball, thus protecting the elbow, wrist and hand from
undue stress."

"If the angle is off by one or two degrees the racket doesn't work," said Ms.
Hauptman. "There have been other diagonal rackets before, but finding the exact
angle for the ellipse was not a trivial calculation. We've eliminated what
causes vibration by doing away with a long and short string." (The ellipse is
the shape of the head of the racket.)

This is not Ms. Hauptman's first foray into the tennis racket market. In 1980,
she invented Mad Raq, which had a stringing design based on the weaving of a
snowshoe. She was featured in a First Bank of Chicago advertisement as the only
woman to invent a sports product. While no longer on the market, 500,000 Mad Raq
racquetball rackets were sold and tens of thousands of tennis rackets, mostly in
Europe.

"The royalty checks helped pay the way for bringing up my three children," said
Ms. Hauptman.

Ms. Hauptman is also a painter, and her experience using conventional rackets
led her to design the PowerAngle rackets.

"I can't paint realistically without really fine motor control," she said. "When
I played with conventional rackets my arm hurt. There are a lot of people like
me."

Most of the trial and error for the PowerAngle was done in Ms. Hauptman's front
yard. With her husband, Allen, an internist at New York University Hospital, and
her three children, Dan, 22, Nicole, 21 and Marissa, 19, all away at school,
friends like Judy Weill, working for Ms. Hauptman's homemade breads and soups,
would assist.

"She would hold the frame while I drilled it," said Ms. Hauptman. " I'd
calculate where to drill the holes, physically drill them, and then string it
up."

The result is a racket that Ms. Hauptman claims helps alleviate tennis elbow, a
condition that makes many players wish they had never picked up a racket in the
first place.

Ray Gurson, 71, a member of the tennis committee at Heritage Hills in Somers, a
large community mainly inhabited by older people, said he had been using the
racket and his elbow had not been bothering him. "It's a very light racket and
the strings seem to grip the ball," he said.

Manufactured in Taiwan and on the market since January, the racket comes in
three different model sizes, seven different colors and with two different
balance and flexibility points, and sells for $189 to $219. The company allows
buyers of the racket to try it out for two weeks. If they don't like it they can
return it and get a refund.

"A couple of people asked for their rackets to be strung tighter, but only a
handful returned it outright," said Ms. Hauptman.

Ms. Hauptman also has a track record with the Mad Raq, which David Meyers, an
owner of Tennis Professionals in Port Chester, called a "great racket, but very
hard to string."

With the PowerAngle, Ms. Hauptman said she has relished the chance to learn from
her mistakes. She has made the new rackets easier to string by manufacturing a
special string with one of the top stringing companies, Gamma.

The string is half one color and half another. The two colors correspond with
two different colored numbers on the frame. Every racket also comes with
stringing instructions.

Marc Kessler, a professional racket technician, said: "It's very intimidating to
look at and string at first, but she makes it simple by the diagram she provides
on the racket. It's like connect the dots with the different color string going
into each number. It's actually easier to string than conventional rackets."

The PowerAngle rackets are now stocked in many eastern tennis stores, including
Paragon and Princeton Ski Shop in Manhattan, Pedigree in White Plains and the
Tennis Professionals at Sound Shore Indoor Tennis Club in Port Chester, but Ms.
Hauptman would not say how many of the rackets have been made or sold. The
racket has a Web site, www.powerangle.net.

None of this means the racket will be a success in the broader marketplace.

"It's a great concept," said Karen Moriarty, another owner of Tennis
Professionals. "But I don't know if in retail it will translate."

Mr. Meyers said the biggest strike against PowerAngle is there are "established
racket companies that have been longstanding, household names to tennis players,
like Prince, Wilson and Head."

"It's very difficult to break in unless you have big advertising dollars," he
said. "But if anyone can do it Madeline can."

PRO 'CZECHED' OUT IN '79 BEFORE CHECKING INTO BUSINESS

BYLINE: Ron Cobb

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 8D

LENGTH: 840 words


When he was 22, John Molin of New York was a borderline professional tennis
player. He was good enough to be ranked No. 230 in the world but realistic
enough to have applied to Columbia University's business school.  After being
accepted, he mulled things over for a year: Should he stay on the tour or go
back to school?  Then, in a 1979 tournament in Austria, he was clobbered 6-2,
6-2 by a skinny kid from Czechoslovakia, and Molin's mind was made up.  ''I said
to myself, 'If I can't do any better against a guy like this, I've got to hang
it up.' '' Molin went on to Columbia and now runs a pension advisory company in
New York. He was in town this week and reached the semifinals of the USTA
National Men's 35 Indoor at Town & Country Racquet Club.  The skinny kid from
Czechoslovakia was Ivan Lendl.  How Soon They Forget: How could John Sadri, once
ranked as high as No. 14 in a 10-year pro caree r that ended in 1988, show up
here for the Indoor 35s with such a small arsenal of rackets? In his semifinal
victory Tuesday night, he broke strings on his top two rackets and had to play
with an inferior one he'd brought along as an afterthought.  ''I used to carry
six or seven,'' he said. ''The racket manufacturers would call me and say,
'John, can we send you some rackets? How about a half-dozen?' So a while ago I
called a manufacturer and said, 'I'm John Sadri, and I'm going to play the
national 35s. Could you send me some rackets?' And they said, 'John who?' So I
went to Wal-Mart and bought two widebodies.'' Notes from the local tennis scene:
Although the USTA Senior League for players 50 and over is set to begin June 3,
it's not too late to sign up and find a team.  League coordinator Nancy
Williford reports that more than 180 men and women and 20 teams are lined up so
far. The new league will be structured like the USTA Adult League, with three
skill levels - 3.0, 3.5 and 4.0 - except that competition will be in doubles
only.  After the season ends July 31, winning teams will advance to the
sectionals Aug. 9-11 in Kansas City. Sectional winners will advance to the
nationals next fall. For more information, call Williford at 965-9932.  After 11
years on the women's pro tour, Kim Steinmetz is back in St. Louis for good,
although she hopes to play a few USTA circuit tournaments this summer. She is
weighing options for a teaching job at one of the clubs here.  On Sunday at the
Simpson Tennis Complex in Alton, where she won the Lewis & Clark Open singles
and doubles, she said that her comeback from an injury did not go as well as she
had hoped this year.  Among the highlights of her career? A first-round upset of
Natalia Zvereva in the 1988 U.S. Open, three months after Zvereva made the
French Open final.  Texas has been the state of choice for many college-bound
St. Louis players. At the Lewis & Clark Open, there were Steinmetz (ex-Southern
Methodist, Trinity), Noel Quevreaux (ex-Southwest Texas), Blair Strassner (Rice)
and Steve Beauchamp (ex-SMU). Also in Texas are Joe Horwitz (SMU) and Teri
Martin (Texas Christian).  Martin, a sophomore, was a big reason why the TCU
women won their first Southwest Conference title and finished the season ranked
No. 23 nationally.  She was 22-7 in dual matches at No. 3 singles and 16-8 at
No. 1 doubles and was one of six players named to the All-SWC team. At
Visitation Academy, Martin won four state titles - three in singles and one in
doubles.  Kudos to Ken Flach not only for a gratis exhibition with brother Doug
at Saturday's Hall of Fame Festival, but also for coaxing a $3,000 grant from
the IBM/ATP Tour to the Triple A Youth Foundation.  Town & Tennis pro Mario
Barretto was runner-up last weekend in a prize-money tournament in Columbia, Mo.
The champ was Hakan Svensson, the 1988 and '90 winner of the Lewis & Clark Open.
Friends gathered Tuesday night at West Chester Tennis Club to say goodbye to
teaching pro Charlie Bachman, who is moving to Chicago.  The St. Louis tennis
wedding of the year took place in the Washington, D.C., area on Saturday, when
Steffen Porter of Head Sports and Suzette Guffey of Tennis & Ski Warehouse
walked down the aisle. Guffey originally is from the D.C. area.  Muny deadlines
loom: next Thursday for the Father-Son and Parent-Child (June 4-8) and June 3
for the Dwight Davis Championships (June 7-15).  The following players have been
endorsed by the St. Louis District to the national qualifying circuit, based on
the recent endorsement tournament at the Dwight Davis Tennis Center. In their
order of finish: Girls 18s: Siri Eklund, Kate Himstedt, Cynthia Kuczynski,
Jennifer Temps.  Girls 16s: Laura Guignon, Mary Rumbaoa, Sarah Mullenix and
Laura George.  Boys 14s: Jacob Hardimon, Kenny Powell, Matt Crystal, Andrew
Gitt, Randy Wolfe and Darren Bender.  Girls 14s: Brianna Lynch, Allison Flynn,
Jill Aboussie, Elissa Udell and Leslie Burkemper.  Granted injury exemptions
were Mary Ellen Strassner in girls 16s and Danny Stahlschmidt in boys 14s.  Boys
16s and 18s will play May 31-June 2.

TABITHA DONATES BOOKS TO LINCOLN CITY LIBRARIES

Tabitha Health Care Services - Nebraska's longest-serving home care and hospice
agencies - donated books to Lincoln City Libraries to promote awareness of home
care and hospice during National Home Care and Hospice Month celebrated annually
in November. Hospice of Tabitha nurse Karla Whisler, RN, CHPN, donated two
copies of "Lifetimes: A Beautiful Way to Explain Death to Children" and three
copies of "Caring For Your Parents, The Complete AARP Guide" to Suzan Connell,
coordinator of Library Resources for Lincoln.

"Lifetimes" helps explain to children the death of a pet, friend or relative.
This sensitive book, written by Bryan Mellonie, is a useful tool in explaining
to children that death is a part of life and that, eventually, all living things
reach the end of their own special lifetimes. Co-authors of "Caring for Your
Parents" and AARP experts Hugh Delehanty and Elinor Ginzler guide readers along
an innovative and resourceful path to caregiving - one that deepens the
intergenerational bond, transforming an undeniable duty into a journey of
spiritual growth and personal discovery. These books can be checked out at any

Nadal raises a racquet; Babolat taking market share from Head, Prince, Wilson

BYLINE: SUHRITH PARTHASARATHY, Columbia News Service

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. B21

LENGTH: 941  words

DATELINE: NEW YORK


When Quinn Foley wanted to swap his old Wilson tennis racquet for a new one, the
choice was easy. He found the Babolat's dazzling colours irresistible.

"Overall, the Wilson didn't feel as streamlined," said Foley, 13, who lives in
New York City. "Also, the Babolat is such a cool racquet, and what initially
caught my eye was just how awesome it looked on the shelf. When I did some
research, I realized that it's also a very good racquet."

For his friend Alexander Foy, who shifted to Babolat when he was 7, the decision
had as much to do with technical specifications as it did with the racquet's
"good looks."

"In a way it feels like the racquet makes me play better," said Foy, 13. Great
players like Rafael Nadal use Babolats, "and I think it looks really cool too.
The colours are striking and it's also a very fluid racquet."

The loyalty of fans such as Foy and Foley has helped make Babolat one of the
best-selling racquets in the U.S., despite having entered the market only in
2000. Its success is based on two factors: the racquet's uniquely appealing look
and the allure of Nadal, the world's No. 2 ranked tennis player, winner of 10
grand slam titles and Babolat pitchman, say tennis store owners. It has gained
the reputation among youngsters - and some not-so-young players - for being the
hippest racquet in town.

Tennis retailers say that they sell more Babolat racquets than any other brand
and even the competition acknowledges the company's dominance. Over the past 12
years, it has acquired a sizable chunk of the market, according to Greg Mason,
vice-president of sales and marketing at Head Tennis USA, a rival manufacturer.

Babolat, headquartered in Lyon, France, is a family-owned company that began
manufacturing tennis racquets in 1994, although it has been making strings - and
has been renowned for it - since the late 1880s.

Woody Schneider, who owns four tennis racquet stores in New York, described
Babolat's rise as a "phenomenon." He estimates that 40 per cent of the racquets
he sells are Babolat.

"In my 32 years of being in the tennis industry, I have never seen anything like
it,' he said. "You've got to think Nadal plays a big role in this. A lot of
people come to the store with their minds set on buying a Babolat. Even those
who don't have a preconceived notion often end up buying one once they take a
look at it."

Experts in the sports management field believe that while Head, Wilson, and
Prince all make "reliable" racquets, Nadal's unique appeal makes Babolat
particularly attractive to younger players.

"It certainly needs to be viewed in the context of Nadal, who is such a
compelling, magnetic figure," said Andy Dallin, co-founder of ADC Partners, a
sports management firm headquartered in Alameda, Calif.

"When Michael Jordan did a Gatorade commercial and was signed by Nike, he said,
"it made a massive difference to the brands. With Nadal, it's similar. Kids
would love to be like him - he is this macho figure who is just so captivating."

Many around the U.S. had scarcely heard of Babolat until a few years back.
Nadal's rise - in 2010, for instance, the Spaniard won three of the four grand
slams - has played a significant part in the brand's popularity for fans of all
ages.

For Dylan Gale, 31, a Florida resident who uses a Babolat Aero Pure Drive, the
company's alliance with world's top players played a direct role.

"I only knew of Wilson, Head and Prince. It was only when I saw players like
Nadal, Roddick and Clijsters playing with Babolat did I give it a try," said
Gale, referring to former world No. 1 players, Andy Roddick and Kim Clijsters.

"I think it's only natural for fans and players of all ages, including
club-level players, to want to emulate their idols. That includes buying
products that their favourite players use."

Babolat also benefited by building its connection with retailers when other
brands were concentrating on Internet sales. That allowed it to take advantage
of the tennis racquet industry's state of flux.

"They chose not to sell over the Internet initially and instead focused on local
retailers, and thereby gathered a good market share," Mason said. "But you've
got to give them credit for it."

While Babolat's popularity has had much to do with Nadal's appeal and the
brand's penchant for funky colours, the effect of the racquet's reliability
cannot be underestimated, experts said.

"Obviously, getting hold of key players like Nadal and Roddick has made a
difference," Mason said. "But it's critical you have a good product, and Babolat
makes very nice racquets."

Babolat, in a statement through its media relations agency, stressed that it's
working on all aspects of its marketability, including coming up with newer
colours to appeal to a wider demographic of players.

It declined to comment specifically on its revenues, but said its racquet sales
grew by 39 per cent in 2010 and by a further 25 per cent last year. It also
realizes the importance of its relationship with the top players.

"Long-term contracts with Tour players show confidence in the brand," Babolat
said. "Our top players have been playing with Babolat since they were young.
Thanks to the success of our Team Babolat players, we have been perceived for a
long time as being the brand of the best players in the world."

It remains to be seen, however, whether Nadal's recent defeats to Novak Djokovic
- who endorses Head - and his loss of the No. 1 ranking to the Serb will affect
the brand's popularity among youngsters.

For now, however, its reputation is secure. Foley, the 13-year old player,
summed it up: "The Babolat has got such a great face appeal to it. It's like the
Apple of racquets."

CROATIA'S IVANISEVIC RUNS OUT OF RACKETS

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. C09

LENGTH: 759 words


BRIGHTON, England Goran Ivanisevic banged to bits one racket after another
Thursday and then had none left to play with.

The result? He had to default during the final set of his match at the Samsung
Open.

The Croatian is no stranger to outbursts, but this self-destructive display in
which all three of his rackets were rendered useless might even have been a
first for him.

"I can't remember anybody ever breaking all the rackets in their bag before,"
said Gerry Armstrong, the ATP Tour supervisor.

After he smashed the last of his rackets and incurred two code violations along
the way, Ivanisevic explained his predicament to Armstrong and tournament
referee Alan Mills.

"Gerry, I have no more rackets left," Ivanisevic said.

Armstrong checked to make sure that was indeed the case, and when it became
clear no racket could be found in time, the umpire announced the default because
of a "lack of appropriate equipment."

Ivanisevic will be fined a total of $1,000 for the code violations. However, he
will not be fined for defaulting the match.

"It is not a fineable offense because the reason he didn't finish his match was
only because he ran out of equipment," Armstrong said.

Ivanisevic, furious at his mistakes, trailed 3-1 in the final set in his
second-round match with South Korea's Hjung-Taik Lee at Brighton Center.

* STOCKHOLM, Sweden Top-seed Magnus Norman and three other Swedes advanced to
the quarterfinals of the Stolkholm Open at the Royal Tennis Hall.

Norman won without hitting a ball as his American opponent, Jan-Michael Gambill,
withdrew because of a lower back injury.

Soccer

Barcelona didn't look like a middle-of-the-pack team, beating Belgium's Club
Brugge 2-0 in the UEFA Cup's third round as Rivaldo and Patrick Kluivert scored
six minutes apart in the first half.

Elsewhere, Italian League leader AS Roma beat Hamburg 1-0 when goalkeeper Hans
Joerg Butt let a long shot by Uruguayan Gianni Guigou slip through his hands at
Rome's Olympic stadium.

* Glasgow, Scotland The Glasgow Rangers signed Norwegian striker Tore Andre Flo
from England's Chelsea for a Scottish record fee of 12 million pounds ($17.2
million).

Golf

MELBOURNE, Australia Matt Kuchar birdied the first hole of his pro career in a
round of 3-under-par 69 that left him a stroke back in the Australian Open.

"It's definitely in my mind to win here," said Kuchar, the 1997 U.S. Amateur
champion who recently graduated from Georgia Tech.

Australians Peter O'Malley and Paul Gow and New Zealand's Greg Turner opened
with 68s, and Australia's Aaron Baddeley the winner last year as an amateur, was
a stroke back along with Kuchar, Australia's Robert Allenby and Sweden's Pierre
Fulke.

* SADOHARA, Japan Junko Yasui, bidding for her fourth title of the year, shot a
4-under-par 68 for a one-stroke lead after the first round of the $550,000 Japan
LPGA Tour Championship.

Cycling

BRUSSELS, Belgium Luxembourg's Benoit Joachim, a teammate of Tour de France
winner Lance Armstrong was cleared of using performance-enhancing drugs by his
national federation because of irregularities in the testing procedure.

Olympics

ATHENS, Greece Military patrols, special commando units and more than 1,000
surveillance cameras could be part of security measures for the 2004 Olympics to
confront Athens' history of attacks and bombings, sources said.

* PRAGUE, Czech Republic Emil Zatopek, the great four-time Olympic champion who
died Tuesday, will be buried in Roznov pod Radhosten, a small town not far from
his birthplace in Koprivnice.

* SALT LAKE CITY The inaugural races at the new Olympic speedskating oval in
Kearns will be moved to other venues because of a problem with the concrete
floor.

Skiing

ASPEN, Colo. Germany's Martina Ertl, the overall leader, faces an early-season
threat from Croatia's Janica Kostelic as the world's best women skiers returned
to this Colorado resort for the first time since 1988.

After three World Cup races in which she finished first, second and seventh,
Ertl has amassed 216 points. Sweden's Anja Paerson is second with 133 points,
and Kostelic a rising third at 132.

* LILLEHAMMER, Norway A season-opening World Cup Nordic ski race will be moved
to Beitostolen next week because of poor snow conditions in Lillehammer.

Track

AKRON, Ohio Sprinter Butch Reynolds, whose world record at 400 meters stood for
11 years before being broken by Michael Johnson in 1999, announced his
retirement from international competition at a charity run in his hometown.

What should the consumer be more concerned with - the type of tennis racket used
or the type of tennis string that is in it?

Manufacturers will agree that the type of tennis string you use will add to or
take away from the performance of the racket, and they often print stringing
tension recommendations on the frame itself.

There are many myths associated with stringing your racket and the effect it has
on the racket frame.

Rackets with lower stringing tensions will generate more power. Higher string
tensions will generate more ball control for experienced players.

Racket frames come in all different sizes and shapes and therefore have
different stringing patterns. A frame that has fewer strings or a lower string
density will generate more power. Frames that have longer string lengths in
their stringing pattern will generate more power. Smaller diameters generate
more power. Higher string gauge numbers translate into smaller diameters of the
string.

Spin can be directly related to the type of tennis string you use. A thinner
string will tend to produce more spin. A less dense string pattern will produce
more spin. Vibration is yet another area that influences tennis string. A softer
string, or one that has a softer coating, will tend to vibrate less. A string
that is more resilient will vibrate for a longer period of time.

String technology has become a science, as manufacturers continue to try to
reproduce the feel of natural gut strings. The marketplace is overflowing with
new tennis strings. Make sure you are an educated consumer when shopping for the
right string.

The dreaded backhand can improve with work

BYLINE: SUSAN BIDDLE JAFFEE

SECTION: CITY TIMES AND INDEPENDENT; Tennis; Pg. 8

LENGTH: 678 words

DATELINE: ST. PETERSBURG



ST. PETERSBURG - Since I first picked up a tennis racket, the bane    of my
existence has been my backhand.

     First, I hit a one-handed backhand. But then in high school, during    the
height of the Chris Evert era, I became an Evert clone - complete    with Chris
Evert tennis shoes and racket - by switching to a two-handed    backhand.

     Today, I'm back to a one-handed backhand. While the shot still    isn't my
ace-in-the-hole, I've at least stopped trying to avoid the    inevitable, thanks
to some patience and drills that took me back to the    basics.

     Step 1: For starters, without racket in hand, stand sideways at the
baseline or in front of a mirror. As if you were pretending to dance    with a
partner, extend your left hand out from your body at waist    level, bringing
your right hand or racket hand back across your body.

 Now, as if your left arm can't move, pull your right arm away from your
body. The end result should have you standing perpendicular to the    court with
your arms spread in opposite directions.

     Step 2: Place a soup can in each hand. Let the weight of the cans    direct
your backhand motion as you take an imaginary swing through the    ball. The
result should have your free arm remaining extended behind    you while your
racket hand is gently pulled away from your body.

     Work toward a fluid swing; never allow yourself to swing with a    whipped
motion. Power does not come from whipping through the ball.

     Step 3: Once you feel comfortable with the basic motion and the    idea
that neither your shoulders or feet turn toward the net, repeat    the motion
with your racket. Imagine a 5-pound weight on the tip of the    racket so that
it - and not the base of the head - leads the racket    through the swing.

     The desired motion is to drive the racket face through the ball,    leading
with the racket tip. As you swing through, try to have the    racket tip finish
level with your free hand. Also, try to hit the ball    at the lower outside
"corner" of the ball, or at what would be the 8    on the face of a clock.

     Step 4: To improve your feel for where the ball should make contact    and
how to pull the racket head through, choke up to the middle of the    racket and
hit a few balls. As you feel more comfortable, progressively    move back to
your normal grip.

     Remember, your back foot does not move or turn during the shot, nor    do
you shoulders. It is your front foot which steps forward and should    sustain
the bulk of your weight as you swing through.

Racquet club's new owners investing in facility

BYLINE: Brandon Boyd, Erie Times-News, Pa.

SECTION: BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS

LENGTH: 403 words


July 31--Tom Pakulski is creating quite a racket in Erie's tennis community.

Pakulski, co-owner of the Westwood Racquet Club, 2660 Zuck Road, has poured
$280,000 into improving the club since he and business partner Rob Lowther took
to the court -- judicial, not tennis -- in February to purchase the club for
$430,000 at a sheriff sale.

The club remains closed for the summer, but will open Sept. 6. An open house
will be held Saturday from 10 a.m. to noon.

The club's future had once been in doubt. A bank had foreclosed after previous
owner Krishnan Anandan racked up a debt of about $1 million, including taxes.

"The key was acquiring the facility," Pakulski said. "Then we needed to fix it
up."

In the months since they purchased the club, Pakulski and Lowther have repaved
the parking lot, repainted the interior, installed new showers in the locker
rooms and furnished a lounge room, complete with couches and a big-screen
television.

The changes won't all be cosmetic, however. Pakulski said he is excited about a
new "Quick Start" program, a tennis program aimed at kids 10 and under.

"It's a beginner's program with bigger, softer tennis balls, a smaller court, a
shorter net and smaller racquets," Pakulski said.

Westwood Racquet Club head pro Ric Harden, who has worked at the club for 14
years, believes the Quick Start program provides kids with a unique opportunity
to learn the game.

Pakulski is hoping the new features and programs translate into an increased
membership. He estimated last year's membership at about 225, down from about
350 in 2006 when Henry Fish, a retired chief executive of American Sterilizer
Co., owned the club.

"The hope is to grow tennis in Erie," he said. "We're hoping for 40 to 50 kids
in our Quick Start program and 250 to 260 members total this year, hopefully."

Memberships at the club last from September to May. Membership is not required
to play tennis at the club.

Pakulski said he's been encouraged by the reaction so far.

"We've heard nothing but positive things from the Erie community," he said.

BRANDON BOYD can be reached at 870-1739 or by e-mail.

When the Brooklyn Racquet Club decided to put on one of those free clinics and
exhibitions, it was understandable why COLIN DIBLEY would be a big-name
attraction for the event, which will be held Sunday starting at 1 P.M.

Dibley, after all, the former Australian Davis Cup player known for "the world's
fastest serve" (145 miles an hour), has been teaching tennis in the New York
area for years.

Less understandable was how the roster of participating pros came to include a
couple of touring players from the former Soviet Union, ALEKSANDR VOLKOV and
ANDREI CHERKASOV.

A bit of sleuthing turned up evidence that corraling Volkov and Cherkasov was an
inside job. The club's resident pro is SERGEI LEONUYK, a former Soviet star who
coached Volkov and Cherkasov in Davis Cup play.

PE-backed Prince will take a swing at Ch. 11

BYLINE: by Aviva Gat

LENGTH: 996 words


Private equity-backed Prince Sports Inc., which makes rackets for tennis and
other sports, now finds itself in a different kind of court with a prenegotiated
reorganization plan that trades its secured debt for equity.  Despite being
known for its innovative racket technology and its current sponsorship of some
of tennis' most elite players, reduced demand for its products and increased
competition over the past five years led Prince and three affiliates to file for
Chapter 11 in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware in
Wilmington on Tuesday. Besides a prenegotiated debt-for-equity swap plan, Prince
came to court with a $2.5 million debtor-in-possession loan.  Judge Kevin J.
Carey will consider authorizing Prince to use $1 million of the loan during a
hearing Wednesday, May 2. Carey will also consider other first-day motions,
including requests for joint administration, to continue using existing cash
management systems, for authority to pay prepetition and postpetition wages and
other compensation and to continue honoring customer obligations.  Carey will
also schedule a hearing on the debtor's disclosure statement.  Under the plan,
ABG-Prince LLC, owed $65 million, will acquire 100% of the reorganized equity in
the debtor.

ABG is also providing the DIP.  Under the DIP loan, Bordentown, N.J.-based
Prince must obtain approval of its disclosure statement by June 29, confirmation
by Aug. 6 and exit bankruptcy by Aug. 20. The DIP includes a $100,000 commitment
fee and accrues interest at LIBOR plus 800 basis points. It matures Aug. 20.
Owned by Providence, R.I., PE firmNautic Partners LLC, Prince is a premier
branded sporting goods company that develops, sources and markets racket sports
equipment, footwear, apparel and accessories for tennis and indoor court sports
such as squash and racquetball, according to a declaration by Prince's president
and CEO Gordon Boggis.  Prince also sponsors some of tennis' most elite
athletes, including David Ferrer, Gael Monfils, Vera Zvonareva and the Bryan
brothers.  Founded in 1970, Prince is known for innovating new designs,
including the "oversized," the "longbody" racket and other racket technology.
Its brands include Viking Athletics, which specializes in platform tennis
equipment, and Ektelon, which makes racquetball equipment.  Prince's products
are sold in 50 countries in more than 5,000 retailers. In the U.S., Prince sells
its products in specialty retail stores as well as in major sporting goods
chains. Prince also licenses its trademark for clothing and proprietary
technology patents for applications in nonracket sports categories.  In fiscal
year 2011, worldwide sales of tennis rackets and other equipment topped $59
million, or about 83% of the company's revenue. The rest of its revenue came
from its sales of equipment for squash, racquetball and platform tennis, which
generated $12 million. Platform tennis is similar to regular tennis, but is
played on a platform in a court enclosed by a screen. The rackets and balls are
also made and shaped differently.  Prince's total sales in fiscal year 2011 were
$72 million, of which $37 million came from sales in North America while $35
million came from international sales.  Nautic Partners acquired Prince from
Lincolnshire Management Inc. in August 2007. Lincolnshire, in turn, acquired the
company from Benetton Group SpA in 2003, where the business had been managed as
part of a recreational sports portfolio along with other brands including
in-line skates maker Rollerblade and ski company Nordica.  Debtor affiliate
Prince Sports Management Holdings LLC is the ultimate parent company and is
94%-owned by Nautic Partners LLC. The remaining 6% is owned by employees, former
employees and former lenders. Prince also has several nondebtor subsidiaries in
Taiwan, China, the United Kingdom, France and Italy.  Prince blamed its
bankruptcy on reduced demands for its products combined with increased
competition over the past five years. In response to its decline, in November
2010, Prince sought to sell the rights to certain brands and its operations in
China in order to pay down significant debts to its then-lenders. The process
ended in February 2011 because Prince did not receive any acceptable bids for
the marketed assets. Instead, Prince sought to upgrade its products and
incorporate new advertising strategies to increase demands for its products.
Prince then commenced a second sale process in October in hopes of selling its
assets or entering into additional licensing agreements. Prince engaged Robert
W. Baird and Co., which found that several parties were interested in acquiring
the company as a going concern.  By March, Baird was in talks with three
potential purchasers that each were offering less than Prince's outstanding
secured debt.  Meanwhile, on March 27, ABG acquired its $65 million secured debt
from GE Capital Corp.and Madison Capital Funding LLC and indicated its interest
in acquiring the company. Prince then decided a sale to ABG would be its best
option to reorganize successfully.  Under the plan, ABG would receive 100% of
the equity in the reorganized debtor and waive its rights to any deficiency
claim.  Other secured creditors and priority claims would be paid in full.
General unsecured creditors would receive a pro rata share of a distribution
fund, while old equity holders would be wiped out.  Prince owes about $10.2
million in trade debt to vendors and about $1.8 million in other payables. For
the fiscal year ending Dec. 31, Prince reported assets of $54.2 million,
including $9.7 million in accounts receivables.  In its petition, Prince pegged
its liabilities between $50 million and $100 million.  Debtor counsel is Laura
Davis Jones, David M. Bertenthal, Joshua M. Fried and James O'Neill of Pachulski
Stang Ziehl & Jones LLP.  ABG's counsel is Richard A. Chesley, Matthew M. Murphy
and Stuart Brown of DLA Piper LLP (US).

Technology causes boom

BYLINE: Greg Boeck

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 2C

LENGTH: 156 words


Technology has affected every professional sport, but perhaps none more than
tennis. The game hasn't been the same since metal rackets were introduced in
1967.

More durable than wood, steel frames added power to the game's best players. The
oversized racket, developed a decade later by Howard Head, and then the
wide-body, unveiled by the industry in 1987, changed the game even more.

Today's rackets offer up to 130 square inches of hitting area, compared with
70-80 for wood rackets. And they can weigh as little as nine ounces, compared
with up to one pound for the wooden models.

Result: lighter, more powerful weapons that brought the pro game into the radar
era.

The same player who hits a 100 mph serve with an oversized wide-body today would
serve at only 80 mph with a standard wood racket.

Said Stuart Chirls, equipment editor of Tennis magazine: ''Today's rackets have
turned some players into cannons.''

Julian Snow aged 21, sharpened his ambition of becoming real tennis amateur
champion this winter when he won his first senior championship at the Manchester
Tennis & Racquet Club yesterday defeating Alan Lovell, the current amateur
champion, 6-0, 2-6, 6-0 in the Manchester Gold Racquet final (William Stephens
writes).

Snow served a tight railroad and volleyed accurately; Lovell was loose in
forcing the dedanns, but effective when playing on the floor.


Snow with James Male won the doubles defeating Lovell and Andrew McDonald 1-6,
6-5, 6-4. John Prenn then beat Male 18-13, 7-15, 15-8, 15-4 in the racquets
singles final as Male tired.

controlsports; tennis; education; gwinnett/county

SECTION: EXTRA; SECTION J; PAGE 11

LENGTH: 380 words


Perhaps you have decided to get your racket restrung before the spring season
starts. The decision raises two questions: What string to use and what tension
to have it strung at.

The first step in answering both questions is analyzing your game. How often you
play, how you play, what kind of racket you use and how often you experience
string breakage all play a part in arriving at the answer.

Give all this information to your stringer and through a mutual discussion, you
should be able to come up with a good selection.

When all rackets were made out of wood, most were strung between 55 and 65
pounds. Then along came Bjorn Borg, who strung his around 80 pounds, so a lot of
people upped their string tension.

A couple of years later, along came John McEnroe, who was stringing his rackets
very low, down in the 40s. Many people dramatically dropped the tension.

What's best for you? The rule of thumb is the higher the tension, the more
control you have, like Borg. The lower tensions will cause some trampoline-like
effect of the ball off the strings, giving you more power for a serve-and-volley
game like McEnroe's.

Tell your stringer what kind of game you like to play and he can string your
racket appropriately.

The type of string can be the most difficult decision since there are hundreds
of choices. Generally speaking, the thinner the gauge, the more feel you have,
but also the shortest wear time.

With the advent of wide-body rackets, string wear has become a major issue. Many
people who switch to one of these new-generation rackets and put on the same
string they had with their previous racket have the strings break the first or
second time they use the racket.

Many companies have come up with what they call wide-body string. Most of it is
a thicker gauge, so the wear factor is increased.

Your stringer will be very happy to help you find the best choice of both
tension and type of string. Talk to him each time you have your racket restrung
and you will be able to get the results you want.

THE CLUB MAKES A RACQUET

BYLINE: By Tony Lombardo Staff Writer

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. B13

LENGTH: 416 words


M. Richard Cutler moved from Newport Beach, Calif., to Augusta in September 2002
with one dream in mind: to own his own tennis club.

The Club at Rae's Creek was for sale, and he liked the natural setting.

"I found it on the Internet, and I came out here," said Mr. Cutler, who also
moved his law practice to Augusta. "I thought we'd have it open in six months."

Three years and more than $2.8 million later, The Club at Rae's Creek, located
at 3206 Wimbledon Drive, is now fully operational.

The public can experience the new clubhouse and the opening of Racquets
Restaurant and Sports Bar at 7 p.m. Saturday.

Rae's Creek provides a nice setting, but the original one-story clubhouse, built
in the 1970s, was "literally falling apart," said Mr. Cutler, a tennis player
since age 8.

He started to rebuild without city approval, however, which stalled the project.
Because of misinformation, Mr. Cutler thought approval wasn't needed.

"We made a mistake in the beginning. Since then, we've done everything that's
been asked and then some," he said.

For example, when the Augusta-Richmond County Planning Commission wanted more
parking, Mr. Cutler provided it.

The club still operated without a clubhouse, but now members have access to the
three-story, 8,000-square-foot facility, which includes a fitness center,
tanning, massage facilities and a pro shop. Outside, the club has 13 tennis
courts and two swimming pools.

The restaurant and bar are always open to the public, Mr. Cutler said. Included
are an 80-inch television screen and an interactive golf simulator.

The restaurant's walls are lined with tennis rackets, part of the club's
"Ten-niseum." After almost a lifetime of collecting, Mr. Cutler has hundreds of
rackets on display, some dating back before 1900.

While the project sat in limbo, Mr. Cutler created displays for his collection.
Some along the walls of the clubhouse are dedicated to players, such as Andre
Agassi or John McEnroe, and others are organized by region.

In the men's restroom, a shrine has been created using Anna Kournikova magazine
covers.

Barbara Leisey, a club member for more than two years, said the improvements
have exceeded her "wildest dreams."

The Grovetown resident said more than tennis pros are welcome to join.

"It's a friendly club," she said. "Everyone here would enjoy playing with you
and teaching you the ropes."

She'll be dressed as a mustard bottle at the grand opening Saturday, which is
doubling as a Halloween party. Her doubles partner will be in ketchup.

Amateur players having a wide-frame affair

BYLINE: By Ailene Voisin Staff writertennis; sports

SECTION: SPORTS; SECTION E; PAGE 09

LENGTH: 665 words


While a significant percentage of professional tennis players lament the loss of
their innocence, or in this case, the demise of wood rackets, the industry is
turning a collective deaf ear.

The message is clear.

Finally, it is the masses who matter.

The tennis racket of today and tomorrow is the one favored not by the pros, but
by the vast majority of recreational players. It's a high- tech composition of
graphite and fiberglass, can be oversized or mid- sized, but invariably is bound
by the latest innovation - a lighter, wider frame that measures between 1 and 1
3/4 inches.

Representatives from Prince and Wilson, the two companies that account for
roughly 70 to 80 percent of the market share, confirm that with few exceptions,
consumers almost exclusively are opting for the lighter, wide-framed, wide-body
rackets. Regional sales manager Rick Kerpasack of Wilson suggests that only five
to eight percent will purchase conventional frames within the next few years,
and adds that consumers - not the pros - will be the equipment trendsetters of
the '90s.

"Our rackets are designed more for recreational players," he said. "The touring
pros, they're inclined to stick with what has been tried and true for them over
the years. You saw the same resistance when the oversized rackets came out.
Jimmy Connors used his T2000 forever. It seems almost ironic, but it's the
consumers who tend to drive the touring pros."

"The industry is pushing the wide-body racket," U.S. player David Wheaton told
Tennis magazine last month.  All of us are under a lot of pressure to use them.
So far, the pros can't get used to them, although the public has embraced them.
The bottom line is that the rackets the pros use are nothing like what the
public's buying, and that can't be good."

The advantages of an oversized, wide-framed racket generally are three-fold - it
enhances power, provides a larger "sweet spot" when the ball meets the racket,
and is several ounces lighter. The mid-sized racket is slightly less powerful,
but allows for creater control and maneuverability.

Yet, partly because of increasing and rapid gains in technology, teaching pros
are divided on which approach is most effective: Allowing that the vast majority
of modern rackets have the wider frames, is it more beneficial to recommend the
oversized racket for more power and a larger sweet spot, or the mid-sized racket
for increased control?

"Those are the two schools of thought," said instructor James Hunt of the DeKalb
Tennis Center, "but it basically comes down to personal taste. It's like a car.
You look at Buicks and Chevrolets and Fords, all quality products, then make a
decision, often based on the color or just a feel. Tennis is no different. And
from a teaching standpoint, it doesn't matter. I still teach the same strokes."

Said teaching pro Vic Braden, "That's absolutely true. I saw Bobby Riggs beat a
good player with a broom handle once. The strokes are what matters. Even the
strings don't matter as much as we thought."

A colleague of Braden's, Don Hightower of the U.S. Racket Stringers Association
in Del Mar, Calif., last year conducted a study of various strings to measure
ball speed. To his surprise - and contrary to common belief in the industry -
Hightower found only minimal differences. "The strings had much less impact than
we thought," he said. "We couldn't even get a standard deviation. The greatest
difference was three percent. The rackets have proven to be much more of a
factor, particularly when there is a dramatic change, say, from wood to midsize
and oversize."

Suffice to say, the oversized racket, and some variation of the wider frame, is
here to stay. Or, as Brian Van Blaricom of Nevada Bob's on Holcomb Bridge Road -
the USRSA Stringer of the Year in 1988 - put it, pointing to a wall in his shop:
"Just look at the wall. What do you see?"

Mid-size and oversize rackets . . . with wide frames.

How can younger children learn to play tennis?

BYLINE: Staff

SECTION: LOCAL SPORTS; Main Sports; Pg. B4

LENGTH: 729 words


By Patrick Swafford

wyotennispro@bresnan.net

The Joy of Tennis - Wyoming, is working with the Wyoming Tennis Association and
the Cheyenne Tennis Association to bring the new nationwide initiative
QuickStart Tennis to Cheyenne. QuickStart Tennis is an exciting new play format
for learning tennis, designed to bring kids into the game by utilizing
specialized equipment, shorter court dimensions and modified scoring, all
tailored to age and size. It is divided into two different levels - ages 8 and
under and ages 10 and under. It's the fast, fun way to get kids into tennis -
and keep them playing.

The QuickStart Tennis format works by getting kids into the game immediately.
Within the first hour of stepping onto the court, they are actually playing the
game, rallying with one another, moving around and having fun. Scaling the game
down to their size helps make the learning process easier and a lot more fun.

The majority of youth sports have followed this very formula for years. Baseball
begins with smaller bats, smaller fields and progresses from tee ball, to coach
pitch, to player pitch. Basketball and soccer also employ similar methods,
including shortened playing surfaces and appropriate sized equipment. That helps
ensure that your kids' first experiences in the sport will leave them overjoyed
not overwhelmed.

The shorter and narrower courts give kids the confidence and ability to cover
the entire court. Kids have trouble controlling full-sized racquets because they
are too long, too heavy and the grips are too large. Junior racquets are
proportionate in length and weight and have the grips that fit smaller hands.
This makes it easier to control. And balls that bounce at a height equal to
kids' playing abilities allows for better and longer rallies and allows them to
build all-court games.

By being introduced to this style of play from the start, your kids will gain
confidence by seeing their own immediate progress, making them more enthusiastic
about continuing to play and improve. QuickStart Tennis enables kids to have
more enjoyable experiences early on in the learning process and having fun is
always a factor in keeping kids involved.

Specifically here is how it works.

Equipment

Just as kids need a court that suits their size, they also need the right size
equipment. That's why both the racquet and ball are different from the equipment
adults use.

Racquets

For an adult player to succeed at tennis, racquet control is essential. The same
goes for kids. But since kids are smaller than adults, kids have trouble
controlling full-size racquets. They're too long, they're too heavy and the
grips are too large. Kids need racquets that are proportionate in length and
weight and have a grip that fits their smaller hands. For 8 and under, the
racquets are 19-, 21- or 23-inches. For 10 and under, the racquets are 23- or
25-inches.

Balls

Kids need a ball that's sized and paced to their playing abilities. A regulation
tennis ball moves too fast, bounces too high and is too heavy for their smaller
racquet. Each age group, therefore, uses a ball better suited to their size and
unique playing ability. For 8 and under, a foam ball or a very low compression
ball moves slower, bounces lower and travels less distance. For 10 and under, a
low compression ball moves a little faster and travels farther than the ball
used with the younger group, but it still has a lower bounce than the original.

Court Dimensions

QuickStart Tennis uses equipment that is scaled to the size and ability level of
young children. Eight and under children will play on a court that is 36 feet
long and 18 feet wide. The net is 18 feet long and 2-foot, 9-inches in height. A
regulation net is used on the 60-foot court for youngsters 10 and under.

Scoring

For players who are 8 and under, there are only seven points in a game, so match
play is short and sweet. Kids play the best of three games; the first to score
seven points wins the game. The first to win two games wins the match. Players
who are 10 and under play the best-of-three sets; the first to win four games
wins a set.

SQUASH: HARRIS IN RACE TO MAKE LINE-UP

BYLINE: Nick Pullen

SECTION: Pg. 41

LENGTH: 397 words


DEL Harris has raced back home in time to help Edgbaston Priory begin the
defence of their National League title tonight against Manchester at Sir Harrys
Road (7pm).

His arrival highlights the crisis in squash following the collapse of the men's
world championships in Melbourne.

Already fears have arisen over the forthcoming British Open, which is scheduled
to take place in Birmingham next April as sponsors The Eye Group have hit
financial trouble. Organisers were forced to scrap the men's championship this
weekend after 13 of the top 24 players refused to compete when The Eye Group
asked to cut prize money from $ 130,000 to $ 65,000.

Relationships between the sponsor and the Squash Rackets Association have
already become increasingly uneasy following a shortfall in funding for
association events.

This has led to the SRA issuing a writ, but already The Eye Group have produced
statements concerning next year's Open.

Despite the financial fears - some events in Melbourne will continue with the
women's, team and Masters competition going ahead as scheduled.

In the meantime Priory have altered their line-up with Harris now playing at No1
with Italian ace Davide Bianchetti at 2, Paul Lord, 3, Phillip Barker 4 and
Alison Wray 5.

It means no place for new signing Jason Nicolle who has just returned to Priory
this season following a spell with Capitol Nottingham.

Play is scheduled to start at 7pm and tickets can be obtained by contacting
0121-440-2492.

The match will also mark a final appearence from David Clarke who is set to
become the National Coach of New Zealand later this month.

Clarke has agreed to return and take charge of the side as his replacement has
still to be announced.

Maldon added: 'David will be greatly missed as he is a coach of considerable
stature.'

Edgbaston Priory spokesman Bob Malden admitted: 'The SRA haven't been seeing
eye-to-eye with the sponsors for some time and the situation in Melbourne comes
as no surprise to me.

'I understand that it was not neccessarily the cut in money that was the problem
with the players, but the fact as to whether they would get anything at all!

Harris looks set to face Manchester's Nick Taylor, who also opted out of
Melbourne, while Wray is likely to face a tough return to Priory ranks when she
takes on the much publicised Vicky Botwright.

Students make racket at Tennis Club

BYLINE: Natalie Trusso Cafarello, The Blade, Toledo, Ohio

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 437 words


March 24--Young Sylvania School students are learning a sports lesson first
hand: In the game of tennis, no one sits out on the sidelines.

About an hour before the first class bell rings at Central Trail Elementary
School on Tuesday morning, more than 75 children are jumping up and down,
cheering, and doing cartwheels as part of a game of Simon Says. It is the way
the morning Tennis Club prepares for an hour of practicing the racket sport.

The club began last year but since has grown into a morning club that teaches
the early-start basics for the game.

"We scaled down the sport for kids of all ages," Mark Faber said. Director of
Laurel Hill Tennis Club in Toledo, he and Michele Henson, Highland Elementary
School teacher, run the program. The morning club meets every Tuesday and
Thursday at Central Trail, and Monday and Wednesday at Highland. That makes for
more than 200 participants.

Assisted with parent volunteers and two professional tennis coaches, the
children learn hand-eye coordination, quickness, and other processing skills,
using smaller tennis rackets and a makeshift net made of tape held by two
chairs.

"Everyone is moving. There are no lines. Contrary to other team sports, no one
sits on the sidelines," Brian Meyer, a volunteer, said.

He was challenging the students to catch their partners' tennis racket before it
touched the ground.

Each person holds the tip of the racket with their finger, and when he called
go, they quickly switched positions, letting their finger off their rackets,
circling around to grab the other's racket before it fell to the ground.

Caleb McNeal, 11, was volleying a foam tennis ball with a friend before time was
called, and he switched to another activity station set up in the gym.

"It's cool. And I like to play tennis in the spring," he said.

His father, Edward McNeal, Jr., said Caleb, a fifth grader, has been extremely
interested in golf and tennis, so this was a good activity for him to join.

For third-grader Sydney Grill, 8, it was easy to wake up for morning tennis
practice.

"I never tried tennis before, and I want to do new things," she said, adding she
also participates in soccer and gymnastics.

Mr. Faber said he plans to increase the club coverage, eventually having a
morning club at all the elementary schools.

"We want to see the game grow."

He said that the morning club is a perfect for parents and children.

"Everyone is so programmed and has so much going on. But the morning they
already have to come to school," he said.

Squash chiefs back Nicol's English switch

SECTION: Sport, Pg.42

LENGTH: 384 words


THE Squash Rackets Association last night defended the decision of Scotland's
world champion Peter Nicol to switch his allegiance to England.

By defecting, Nicol will benefit from the 1.1million annual Lottery grant which
provides a worldclass infrastructure for the country's elite squash players.

Matt Hammond, the SRA's performance director, said: "Peter has had to watch a
number of his key opponents receive support from their own government agencies
which has enabled them to move closer to him.

"He has acknowledged that our world-class programme represents the best all
-round support programme in the world and wants to take advantage of that
opportunity."

Nicol, 27, has appealed to Scotland to allow him to defend his Commonwealth
title in Manchester next year.

The Scottish Squash Association reacted angrily to news of Nicol's decision and
the Scotland Commonwealth Games Council have the power to stop him from
representing England at the Games next summer.

Sheffield boxer Clinton Woods has set his sights on a summer showdown with
American superstar Roy Jones Junior - providing he can dispose of Greg Wright at
the Ponds Forge International Arena on Saturday night.

The Woods camp believe their man will have to be at the top of his game to beat
Wright - a late stand-in for former world champion Michael Nunn - and secure a
title shot for Jones'WBC belt.

Britain's No 1 skier Alain Baxter has joined forces with the British Olympic
Association to launch a new state-of-theart training base in Austria.

The 500,000 facilities, in Lofer, will allow British preparation for next year's
Winter Olympics to be located on the continent.

The British set-up has received a boost recently with the superb performance of
Baxter, who achieved the best-ever World Cup slalom result by a Briton,
finishing fourth in Are, Sweden, 10 days ago.

The Bob Jones/Ray Morse Memorial speedway meeting takes place at Swindon
tonight, which will see a top class line-up compete for the individual trophy.

Elite League stars Craig Watson, Ales Drymal and Lukas Drymal, compete against
Swindon's Paul Fry and Alan Mogridge.

Also in the line-up will be Michael Coles, John Jorgensen, Martin Dixon, Oliver
Allen, Rusty Harrison, Claus Kristensen and Mark Steel.

Stout adds British title to us crown

SECTION: Pg. 30

LENGTH: 144 words


Former Cheltenham College pupil James Stout can now add the British Open rackets
title to the US Open crown he won in Philadelphia last month.

Stout defeated former Harrow pupil, Alex Titchener-Barrett in the final at
Queen's Club by four games to one, 11-15,15-4,15-6,15-6,18-13.

Titchener-Barrett had previously beaten the world champion Harry Foster.

Stout was a boarder at Cheltenham College from 1997 to 2002, which is where he
found his love and skill for rackets under the careful guidance of Karl Cook,
Master in Charge of Rackets, and Mark Briers, the Rackets Professional.

Cook said: "Jamie has been in exceptional form this season, his experience at
New York Rackets and Tennis Club as assistant professional has allowed him to
hone his skills.

"Having won both titles, he now qualifies for a chance to challenge for the
World Championship title next season."

TENNIS

BYLINE: Rod Carlyle; Backswing will hinder volley at nettennis

SECTION: EXTRA; SECTION J; PAGE 06

LENGTH: 347 words


Why do so many of us have trouble with volleys? In theory, this should be our
easiest shot. All we have to do is get our racket flat in front of the ball and
let it bounce back. Where we run into trouble is trying to get the racket flat
before the ball gets to it.

The main reason people have this problem is that they are told during the first
several lessons to turn their shoulders and take the racket back. This is
correct as long as they are behind the baseline.

After perfecting this they go out to play, and in Atlanta that means doubles
most of the time. So then they are stationed at the net, and when a ball is hit
to them they execute what they have learned. If they are lucky enough to get the
racket on the ball, it usually isn't aimed right and the ball goes off sideways
and onto the next court.

The main problem here is that the ball arrives much earlier than at the
baseline, so the same approach can't be used to hit the ball back. The racket
needs to be out front early, eliminating the backswing. When you are close to
the net, the ball usually is coming at a high speed, so there is no need to hit
hard or as far as when hitting from the back of the court.

Most of you have been told not to swing at volleys, but you often still do. This
is caused by the habit of turning the shoulders.

To fully understand this, stand at the net and extend your racket forward until
it is flat to the net. Now, turn your shoulders and you will see that your
racket is going backward and is aiming toward the next court. This causes you to
hit a foul tip sideways or to have to swing at the ball in your attempt to
square up your racket.

Make volleying easy. When you first see the ball coming while at the net,
immediately extend your racket forward and square it up to the court. This will
enable you to hit a great shot.

TENNIS; Off-season is the right time to get into a different racket

BYLINE: Rod Carlyletennis

SECTION: EXTRA; SECTION J; PAGE 10

LENGTH: 445 words


You tennis game may not be the only thing you want to change during this
off-season. It's also the best time to change rackets.

If you have been contemplating such a change, it's best to do it while not
playing competition matches.

There are so many different types of rackets on the market now that feel so
differently when you hit that it's hard to find the right one. Hit with several
models to see which best fits your game.

The first step is to pick out a shop from which you probably will purchase your
racket and tell them you would like to test some rackets before deciding which
one to buy.

There probably will be a small demo charge for each one you try, but all charges
usually will be deducted from the price of the racket you ultimately buy.

With technology advancing as fast as it has in the past couple of years, it is
hard to know exactly what is the right choice for your style of play. The new
widebodies come in all sorts of configurations, each of which presents a
different playability.

Some are wide from top to bottom, some are wider at the top and taper down and
some are wider at the throat with dual tapers.

The new advance this year is weight, with some rackets dropping from 12 to 10
ounces. With such a spectrum it is very hard for anyone to say exactly which you
will like best.

With all the advanced technology that has come along, it will be no surprise to
find that prices have gone up considerably. Because of this, you want to be very
sure that you make the right choice.

The best way to do this is when you demo the rackets, use each one for some
time. Take one each time you play, not four or five. You will not be able to
make a good evaluation by just hitting for a few minutes, because there will be
a period of adjustment with each model.

Some you may like at first, but not as much as you hit with it longer. And some
that you won't like at first will grow on you the more balls you hit.

Some people pick up a racket and hit a couple of balls, love the way it hits and
buy it, only to find later they don't like it. Often, they end up selling their
now-used racket at a considerable loss.

So if you feel it is time to trade in that old wooden racket for one of the new
widebodies, this off-season is a good time to do it. Check with your favorite
pro or racket shop and tell the staff what you are going to do. I'm sure they'll
work out a good demo program for you.

Barbaro Asks an End To Some Tax Breaks

SECTION: Section B; Page 7, Column 4; Metropolitan Desk

LENGTH: 153 words


Assemblyman Frank J. Barbaro of Brooklyn, who is seeking the Democratic
nomination for Mayor, said yesterday that he favored ending tax abatement
programs that had been introduced by Mayor Koch for development in midtown and
the Wall Street area.

Mr. Barbaro's proposal was contained in a position paper on the city's fiscal
affairs. Mr. Barbaro also said that more tax auditors should be hired and that
tax appeal actions for small businesses and homeowners should be made easier.

Mr. Barbaro contended that ''even private clubs got abatements from Mayor Koch,
with the City Racquet Club getting a $385,000 break and the New York Health and
Racquet Club a $285,000 exemption.''

Mr. Barbaro yesterday received the endorsement of the Transport Workers of
America. Mayor Koch won the endorsement of the International Ladies Garment
Workers Union.

Racket smashed, trashed, treasured;
Roi Miller of Dayton gets Serena's damaged gear, plus her autograph.

BYLINE: By Marc Katz Staff Writer

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. B1

LENGTH: 278 words


DAYTON - Roi Miller showed off the ultimate souvenir this week at the Jim
Nichols Tennis Center while watching the Dayton Daily News/Montgomery County
Open.

On Monday, Miller - a 59-year-old Dayton native and resident - watched with
several others while Serena Williams practiced at the Lindner Family Tennis
Center in Mason for the Western & Southern Financial Group Women's Open. Then he
asked the question he figured everyone else was going to ask.

Miller requested the racket Williams smashed on the ground when a few strokes
didn't go her way.

"I'm a pack rat," said Miller, who runs a transportation service and also is a
local actor and singer. "I've got everything." He wanted Williams' rose-colored
Wilson racket with the white grip. The frame was cracked in about three places
and was a little lopsided, but the strings were still intact, and after all,
Williams was once the world's No. 1-ranked player and may be again. Miller asked
a guard if he'd ask Williams for the racket. He did, handing it over to the
giddy Miller, who then headed home. "I was already off the grounds when I
thought, 'I really ought to get her to sign this,' " Miller said. He turned
around and found Williams still working out. He asked the guard if he could get
Williams' signature on the racket, and even asked if she would personalize it.
"I thought she might," Miller said. "My pen was the same (rose) color of the
racket. I thought she might ask to keep the pen, too." Williams signed the grip,
"To Roi, Serena." Then she looked at Miller and held up his pen. "Trade?"
Williams said. "Of course," Miller answered.

Squash: Marshall faces official exclusion

BYLINE: By RICHARD EATON

SECTION: SPORT PAGE; Page 26

LENGTH: 324 words


A NEW and strongly-worded boycott threat by 17 leading players has brought much
closer the possibility that the Squash Rackets Association will today cancel the
men's event at next week's English national championships in Manchester.

Yesterday's statement including the names of 14 of the top 16 men, among them
the British champion Peter Marshall, publicly demands the instant and permanent
abolition of England selection and ranking criteria, and appears to leave the
SRA with nowhere to go.

The SRA has three times extended the entry deadline for the event in the hope of
a compromise, but now says it will make its final decision at 2pm today. As it
had given ground during the process of devising a peace formula - abolition of
the selection and ranking criteria this year in return for their inclusion in
future national championships with an agreed minimum level of prize money - it
is hard to see yesterday's complete rejection bringing any further positive
official response.

The SRA said that unless most of the leading players agree to participate it
will cancel the men's event, and that looks the likely outcome. Another
possibility is that the event will be held and England will subsequently send a
third-rate team to this year's world championships because participation in the
nationals has been made a condition of selection.

The only leading player apparently supporting the SRA compromise proposal is
Phil Whitlock, the England captain. ''Of course I am sympathetic to the players,
but I don't see how they will gain anything more this way,'' he said. ''I feel
bad about the whole thing because the proposal was my idea and it has led to a
kind of split.''

Whitlock would prefer the players to seek the constitutional abolition of this
selection condition by gaining representation on the SRA executive committee.
But a compromise by either the players or the SRA looks increasingly unlikely.

Mavericks moving into old Racquet Club

BYLINE: Keith Lawrence, Messenger-Inquirer, Owensboro, Ky.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 647 words


Sept. 28--The old Executive Inn Racquet Club at 817 W. First St. -- the last
remaining part of the old Executive Inn Rivermont complex -- is coming back to
life these days.

The former Shreveport-Bossier Mavericks, four-time American Basketball
Association national champions, will move its headquarters into the building on
Friday as the team becomes the Kentucky Mavericks and joins the Premier
Basketball League.

"People won't believe it's the same building," Miann Ferison, the team's
marketing manager, said Wednesday. "It's going to be our home office with a
merchandise store, ticket office, a full practice court with goals from the
Houston Rockets and training and weight rooms. It's a perfect fit for us."

The team will play its home games at the Sportscenter.

In 2013, Riverfront JAM LLC announced plans to build condos in Waterford Place,
a five-story condo complex planned for that property.

But City Manager Bill Parrish said Wednesday, "We believe that the future plans
for the site will take two to three years to mature."

Progress toward development is a multi-step process. This year, the developers
closed on the property immediately south of the tennis facility and the (condo)
project, including utility work, is part of the Downtown TIF that is being
considered by the City Commission next month," he said

The developers are in the process of conducting their due diligence in the form
of a feasibility study to best determine the kind of residential units that fit
the market and location," Parrish said.

The old Racquet Club, once the only indoor tennis facility in Owensboro, is not
a long-term location for the Mavericks, he said, "and they understand that this
is a temporary facility."

But Parrish said the city is happy the team is moving into the old building.

"The old tennis facility and parking area to the east side have been used as a
staging area for contractors and city crews doing their work downtown," he said.
"City crews have also used the building for storage during the downtown
revitalization process."

Parrish said city crews have been cleaning out the western two-thirds of the
building for use by the Mavericks as a training facility.

"We did have to replace a water heater that had gone bad, but most of the work
is in the form of touch-up paint, bush trimming, mulching the beds and the
like," he said.

With the team moving into the building, Parrish said, "The city receives rent
for an otherwise unoccupied building, has a tenant in an otherwise unoccupied
building and provides a good facility downtown for our professional team, which
aspires to be part of the NBA's D-League."

He added, "Their location will also add to the energy in our downtown."

Ferison said players won't report for practice until Dec. 29.

In the meantime, she said, the team is allowing local high school and college
teams to use the facility this fall.

A ribbon cutting and open house for the public to tour the facility is scheduled
from 1 to 1:45 p.m. on Oct. 2.

Parrish said the Mavericks are purchasing an advertising bus wrap to put on one
of the city buses to promote the team.

He said that once the Holiday Inn finishes its work on the Riverwalk from the
Owensboro Convention Center to the western edge of its property, "we intend to
open up the lot between the tennis facility and the Holiday Inn for additional
downtown parking."

Parrish said, "I see this as particularly attractive for those who want to walk
the riverfront, which will measure almost half a mile from the Holiday Inn to
River Park Center, for large events like Friday After 5, air shows, 4th of July
and the like, as well as for overflow parking for large conventions."

TENNIS CLASS

BYLINE: Rod Carlyle; To hit on just the right racket, try before you buytennis

SECTION: EXTRA; SECTION J; PAGE 08

LENGTH: 404 words


Your game may not be the only thing you want to change during this off-season.
It's also the best time to change rackets. If you have been contemplating such a
change, it's best to do it while not playing competition matches.

There are so many different types of rackets on the market now that it's very
hard to find the right one. It's best to hit with several models and see what
best fits your game.

The first step is to pick out a shop and tell them you'd like to see some demo
rackets. They will probably have a small charge for each one you try, but all
these charges will usually be deducted from the price of the racket you
ultimately buy.

With technology advancing as fast as it has in the past couple of years, it's
hard to know the right choice for your style of play. The new wide-bodies come
in all sorts of configurations, and each presents a different playability.

Some are wide from top to bottom, some are wider at the top and taper down, some
are wider at the throat and some have two tapers. The new advance this year is
weight - with some dropping from 12 to 10 ounces. With such a spectrum, it's
very hard for anyone to say exactly which you will like the best.

With all the advanced technology that has come along, it will be no surprise to
find that prices have gone up considerably. Because of this, you want to be very
sure you make the right choice.

When you test the rackets, use each one for some time. Take one each time you
play, not four or five. You won't be able to make a good evaluation by just
hitting for a few minutes, because there will be a period of adjustment with
each model.

You may like a racket at first, but like it less the longer you hit with it.
Some people pick up a racket, like the way it hits and buy it, only to find
after they play a couple of sets that they don't like it. They end up selling
their now-used racket at a considerable loss.

So if you feel it's time to trade in that old wooden racket for one of the new
wide-bodies, this is a good time to do it. Check with your favorite pro or
racket shop and tell them what you are going to do and they'll probably work out
a good demo program for you.

All a question of angle

LENGTH: 255 words


AN OHIO mathematician has invented a tennis racquet with a rotating handle that
he claims can transform hapless hackers into sure-fire smashers at the flick of
a screw.

The "index handle" racquet has a six-sided grip instead of the traditional
eight. It also lets players adjust the angle of the racquet face to conform to
their anatomy.

Inventor Andy Brown, an actuarial consultant in Cincinnati and a recreational
tennis player, blames a tilted racquet face for many of the frustrations of
beginner players.

"One guy grabs a racquet and has the face straight up and down," Brown said.
"Another guy grabs it and has the face facing up 40 degrees.The guy with the
handle facing up 40 degrees isn't going to get the ball in the court." His
racquet allows a player to adjust the angle over 60 degrees at any of 10
settings simply by loosening a screw in the bottom of the handle. Any player
will thus swing with a level racquet head, Brown says.

Joseph Hamill, a University of Massachusetts researcher, says the six-sided
handle fits the hand better and puts the wrist in a stronger position.He says it
also seems to reduce vibration that contributes to tennis elbow.

"The hot new field today is ergonomics," he said, referring to the study of
tailoring machines to their human users. "Basically, what this racquet does is
give you an ergonomic advantage." Hamill, a professor of biomechanics, compared
the new racquet with traditional ones in a study of both hackers and more
accomplished players.

Martin Luther King Park, White Bear Racquet and Swim Club and the University of
Minnesota's St. Paul Campus are three of the Twin Cities sites where free
90-minute lessons will be given this month as part of the Play Tennis America
program.

The national program, sponsored and promoted by the Tennis Industries of
America, aims to attract 500,000 new players to the game over the next three
years and also hopes to get many of the 6 million former players who left tennis
back into the game. The program is being conducted in 25 cities nationally.

Ninety-minute starter lessons will be given to new and former players, juniors
and adults by local teaching professionals, who essentially are donating their
services by getting paid just $2.50 per player. Loaner rackets will be available
at all sites.

"We want to introduce or remind people about the six 'F's' of tennis," said Jim
Baugh, president of TIA and general manager of Wilson Racquet Sports. "Those are
that tennis is fun, helps you get fit, can be played fast, helps you make
friends, is a family sport and that you can play it forever."

Local organizers hope to attract 10,000 players to the free lessons, although
5,000 might be more realistic.

Players interested in continuing after the free lesson will be offered a series
of low-cost lessons, starting at $25 for a six-week beginners program.

Dates for the lessons at Martin Luther King Park (phone, 298-5661) are June 6,
8, 13, 15 and 17. At White Bear Racquet Club (426-1308), free lessons will be
given June 14, 15 and 17. On the university's St. Paul Campus (721-0909), free
lessons are on June 21.

You must call in advance to register (and for lesson times).

Tennessee vs. Louisville

*Tim Gardner's pick: Louisville. "The only way Tennessee wins this game is if
they hit their shots from outside. With the exception of the first 10 minutes
against Butler, they simply haven't done that well enough."

*Eddie Timanus' pick: Tennessee. "Tennessee has looked a little shaky, and
Louisville has been dominant. I smell a trap."

*Jeff Zillgitt's pick: Louisville. "Still playing under the radar, the Cardinals
are talented and deep enough to reach the regional final."

Off the Court, Tennis Is in a Slump

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR

SECTION: Section 1;  Page 33;  Column 3;  Financial Desk

LENGTH: 1239 words


With the French Open under way and Wimbledon just weeks away, tennis has many
problems, even apart from Jennifer Capriati's arrest on marijuana possession
charges, the lack of strong competition for Steffi Graf in the women's division,
Pete Sampras's dullness, the proliferation of tournaments and Bud Collins's
pants.

The tennis equipment industry of racquets, balls and shoes has been reeling from
a combination of tumbling sales, insufficient technical innovation and a lack of
inspiration from the current crop of charisma-impaired players.

"The sport has no pizazz," said Bob Carr, publisher of Inside Sporting Goods, an
industry newsletter. "It's so damned elitist. The business peaked in the 70's
and died. Then money didn't go into building courts. It's a sport that requires
facilities and someone near your skill level to play with."

Retailers Pulling Back

Although the overall tennis business is showing some slight signs of
improvement, it is still trying to climb out of the doldrums.

"We've been in a free fall for the past 18 or 24 months," said Jerry Matthews,
the vice president and general merchandising manager of Herman's World of
Sporting Goods, a chain of 39 stores based in Carteret, N.J. "We've
de-emphasized tennis."

Take the situation at the Prince Sports Group, which is controlled by the
Benetton Group of Italy. Overproduction of racquets forced Prince, based in
Bordentown, N.J., to shed inventory for the last year, causing retailers to sell
for $99 Vortex racquets that previously sold for as much as $325.

"When the market went down, we had to get rid of a lot of inventory," said
Charles Peifer, the president of Prince. "It became obvious to us last March,
and we began in earnest to shake it out through February."

Sounding forlorn, he added, "We were giving some extraordinary values."

But that approach "just about destroyed the prestrung racquet business at
Herman's and Sports Authority," a chain owned by Kmart, said Mark Mason, owner
of the Mason Tennis Mart in Manhattan. Prestrung racquets generally sell for $50
to $80 and are used by less-serious players, but the huge price cut made the
Vortex an excellent buy. Prince "didn't understand what they were doing," Mr.
Mason complained.

At the wholesale level, racquet revenues in the United States fell 22 percent
last year to $123 million, from $158 million, according to the Tennis Industry
Association, a trade group based in North Palm Beach, Fla. Ball sales fell 8
percent, to $92 million. Racquet exports fell 27 percent, while ball exports
decreased 18 percent.

Leisure Competition

What else is wrong? Other activities like in-line skating and step aerobics grew
rapidly, while the growth of tennis was flat.

The industry association said that despite modest growth in recent years to 22.5
million players today, 12.5 million players have fallen away since 1978. The
Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association has produced even more worrisome
numbers, finding an 18 percent drop in players, to 14.2 million in 1993.

"But the key thing is that we haven't substantially increased the participation
of hard-core players," said Brad Patterson, the industry association's executive
director. "In 1978, it was five million. Today, it's six million."

Jim Baugh, vice president for marketing at the Wilson Sporting Goods Company in
River Grove, Ill., added: "The sport isn't marketed properly. When you think of
activities you can do for exercise, you can't pick one better than tennis. But
no one is telling the story. It comes down to leadership and not being in touch
with consumers."

Ian Arthur, marketing director at Head Sports Inc. in Boulder, Colo., commented:
"Tennis isn't cool. It hasn't been sold like the N.B.A. and the N.H.L."

Sales have petered out enough to force major sporting goods chains like Herman's
and Oshman's, which is based in Houston and has 170 stores, to scale back the
space they devote to tennis merchandise. "In our new stores, we've devoted about
10 to 15 percent less space to tennis," said David Cooley, a vice president at
Oshman's.

Simultaneously, small stores devoted to tennis have become endangered by their
inability to balance their sales with equipment for other sports, Mr. Mason
said. "I'm the only free-standing tennis specialty store left in Manhattan," he
said, recalling about a dozen rivals in the 1980's. "The mass merchants have
taken away a lot of our business."

The racquet business is dominated by Prince and Wilson, which is known for its
widebody Hammer line. Depending upon various statistical interpretations, both
say they are No. 1. The National Sporting Goods Association estimates that
Wilson has a 40 percent market share, Prince, 23 percent.

But it is a fight for the leadership of a shrinking business. According to
Sportstyle, a trade magazine, Prince's wholesale revenues fell to $50 million in
1993 from $56 million in 1992, while Wilson's fell to $44.1 million from $52.6
million. They were followed by Head, Pro Kennex, Spalding and Dunlop.

It is still a deeply competitive, if contracted, business. Ball sales, led by
Penn and Wilson, produce low profit margins, with most cans selling for $1.99.

"Our business is better than the industry's, but the industry is down," Mr.
Baugh of Wilson said. "For racquets that cost $100 or more, we increased our
market share from 33 percent to 53 percent in the first quarter this year from
last year." He said $100-plus racquets provide one-third of the market.

Since taking over Prince last fall, Mr. Peifer has laid off employees and
slashed the number of racquet models. "We've resized the division to meet the
realities of the marketplace," he said.

Products Too Durable

Part of the problem with sales of racquets priced from $150 to $300 is that
existing players do not need to replace today's better-made metal racquets
anywhere as often as they had to buy new wood models. The restringing business
also is not robust because of the improved technology.

The lack of any significantly new technology the last few years has not induced
skilled players to buy new models.

One bright spot is footwear and apparel, though the gains have been uneven. Nike
Inc.'s footwear sales in the United States fell 36 percent last year (and the
industry's wholesale revenues fell 11.5 percent, to $525 million), but this year
sales are rising on the strength of peddling personalities like Andre Agassi,
John McEnroe and Jim Courier. Nike, based in Beaverton, Ore., has the marketing
clout tennis companies lack; filming will soon start for television spots
featuring Mr. Sampras.

"We're going to show his humorous side," said David Larson, a Nike marketing
director.

But tennis equipment makers are unlikely to mount large television campaigns;
their budgets are much smaller than those of golf club manufacturers. Viewers
are more likely to see Jimmy Connors pushing Nuprin than a Prince racquet,
though the racquet maker recently signed Mr. Connors to test and endorse a new
technology being developed. It also has Michael Chang and Andre Medvedev under
contract. Head has Mr. Agassi. Wilson has Ms. Graf, Mr. Courier, Mr. Sampras and
Todd Martin.

"Agassi sells racquets," Head's Mr. Arthur said of the Radical, a bright yellow
model endorsed by Mr. Agassi and developed with him in mind. "But he sells
better when he does well" -- and he is currently ranked 19th in the world.

BASTION OF COURT TENNIS KEEPS WOMAN ON SIDELINE

BYLINE: By JAMES S. NEWTON

SECTION: Section 1; Page 29, Column 2; Metropolitan Desk

LENGTH: 950 words


On Fridays, after she finishes work as a French teacher in Manhattan, Evelyn
David boards a bus to Tuxedo, N.Y., where she spends the weekend practicing
court tennis, a sport in which she ranks among the nation's top female athletes.

Ms. David makes the 70-minute trip even though she lives just a few blocks from
two of the nation's finest court-tennis courts. At least she is told they are
two of the nation's finest. She cannot say for sure because she has never been
allowed to see them.

The courts near Ms. David's home are part of the New York Racquet and Tennis
Club, on Park Avenue at 52d Street. ''It's a men's club, and they do not allow
women to play,'' she said. ''That's all there is to it.'' Were there other
courts nearby, Ms. David said, she would not take issue with the racquet club's
rules. But there are not. In fact, there are only nine clubs in all of North
America where the ancient sport that once was the favorite of French and British
aristocrats is still played.

Court tennis resembles modern lawn tennis, which is descended from it. The
racquets are similar, and both involve two or four players hitting a ball over a
net.

But the similarity ends there. Court tennis is played indoors, and the court has
sloped walls, an array of netted pockets along the edges of the playing area and
rules for scoring that are so byzantine that even experts laugh when asked to
explain them.

Finding courts near her in such short supply, Ms. David asked to join the New
York Racquet Club. Club officials rejected her, citing the club's long all-male
tradition.

She then asked for permission to use the courts at 7 A.M., promising to be gone
by the time most of the club's members arrived. She was rejected again -
politely, she said, but firmly.

The club's secretary, Clarence C. Pell, called Ms. David a ''troublemaker'' and
said the club had no intention of waiving its rules against admitting women.

But Ms. David plans to pursue the issue and says she sees hope in efforts to
break down barriers to women in other New York clubs, specifically the challenge
by the city's Human Rights Commission to four clubs that will not accept women
as members. Although the racquet club is not one of the four, Ms. David said she
hoped that if the city prevailed, it might prompt the racquet club to rethink
her case.

But members of the racquet club remain firm. ''It may be regrettable, but my
opinion is that she is going to have to keep making the sacrifice for her sport
and commuting to Tuxedo,'' said one member of the club, who asked not to be
identified. ''I trust that she, as a sportsman, will respect the rights of
privacy and free association exercised by the club.''

Issue of Privacy

Those rights, the member said, allow a group of men to organize a club as
privately as they choose. And part of that privacy, he added, includes the right
to exclude women.

After her initial rebuffs, Ms. David appealed again several weeks ago, this time
adding a touch of urgency. Ms. David said she desperately needed more practice
time to prepare for the women's world championships, which are to be held in
England next month. She will be the only American-born woman representing the
United States at that event, Ms. David added.

But appeals to patriotism also failed to move the club.

The club's secretary, Mr. Pell, agreed with several experts that Ms. David
probably ranked in the ''top six or seven'' women players in the United States.
Mr. Pell added, however, that ''she's not really that good.''

''I'm in my 70's, and I could beat her,'' said Mr. Pell, who for many years was
the country's reigning champion in the similar sport of racquets.

Mr. Pell said the club had no plans to waive its rules for Ms. David,
championship or no championship.

Neither Mr. Pell nor the club's manager, Neville Atkins, would elaborate on the
reasons for that decision. Mr. Atkins did not return several phone calls.

One member who asked not to be named said he suspected that Ms. David had a
''second motivation'' behind her efforts to get inside the club -to open its
doors to all women.

Ms. David insists that is not her goal. Her only agenda, she says, is to
practice her sport near her home.

In the meantime, Ms. David has appealed to court-tennis officials for help.
Although she was reluctant to criticize those officials, she conceded that she
had received little sympathy from them.

''The roots of this game are primarily as a man's sport,'' said Thomas M.
Greevy, the professional at the Tuxedo Club, where Ms. David usually practices.
''You sometimes meet with resistance.''

''You have to remember that 20 or 30 years ago, there were hardly any women in
court tennis,'' said Northrup R. Knox, a onetime world open court-tennis
titleholder and a member of the New York club who described himself as
''inactive'' in its affairs.

Mr. Knox said he did not know of Ms. David's case and would not say whether he
would support a woman's effort to practice at the club. Mr. Knox belongs to one
of the other eight court-tennis clubs in the United States, and, he added, ''My
club here in South Carolina welcomes women.''

For about 30 years, court-tennis has attracted a small but faithful cadre of
women. Ms. David said several other women in New York City play the sport
seriously and probably a hundred or so around the country play it casually.

Court-tennis watchers say there are perhaps 20 active women competitors at Ms.
David's level in this country. They spend thousands of dollars for lessons and
travel expenses every year.

And, in Ms. David's case, she and club members agree that at least for the time
being, she will be paying bus fare to Tuxedo as well. z

Racquet Club team pulls out district sweep

DATELINE: ST. PETERSBURG



The Racquet Club of St. Petersburg clinched the men's 4.5 district  championship
in the U.S. Tennis Association Adult Tennis League last weekend  with a decisive
5-0 victory over challenger Belleview Mido.

As a result, the Racquet Club advances to the USTA/Adult League Regional
Playoffs in Longboat Key beginning July 25.

In Saturday's match with Belleview Mido, No. 2 doubles team Tim Brady and
Hernan Molina was the first Racquet Club team off the court with a  straight-set
win. Next, team captain Jim Cohen netted a 6-1, 6-1 victory in  the No. 2
singles position to put the Racquet Club ahead 2-0.

"My win wasn't as easy as the score appears," said Cohen. "It was a  tough one
against Chuck Pollock."

The third and determining match for the Racquet Club win was from Brian  Smith
and Brad Tushaus in No. 2 doubles. The duo pulled out a third-set  tiebreaker to
clinch the district title.

Once the team victory was known, No. 1 singles player Jim Hartley Jr. and  the
No. 3 doubles team of John O'Brien and Jan Lagergren scored wins when  their
opponents retired.

"Once the team win was known, the other players mutually retired," said  Cohen.
"Now we can prepare for the regionals. Five years ago, a Racquet Club  team
advanced to regionals and was just one match short of moving on to the  state
championships. We hope to move on."

In other playoffs, the Racquet Club's men's 3.5 team defeated a Dunedin  team
5-0 and East Lake Woodlands beat a second Dunedin team 4-1.

"The 5-0 win was not as easy as it looks," said Vince Proper, Racquet  Club's
co-captain. "We had three three-set matches."

Straight-set winners from the Racquet Club were Dave Farnsworth and Lee  Baynard
in No. 1 doubles and Proper and Nick Routh in No. 3. Pulling out the
three-setters were Pete Gairing and Jack Weldon in No. 1 and No. 2 singles and
the No. 1 doubles team of Bill Young and Bob Barlow.

In the women's 3.5 playoffs, Countryside Country Club beat Innisbrook 4-1  and
East Lake defeated Bardmoor 4-1. East Lake edged McMullen 3-2 in the 4.0
division.

SUNCOAST SINGLES: East Lake Woodlands tied Seminole Lake Racquet Club with  48
points in the seven-team Suncoast Singles League for women. Royal Racquet  Club
earned 47 points, Bardmoor Tennis and Fitness Club and the Racquet Club  of St.
Petersburg 30, Tierra Verde 23, and the St. Petersburg Tennis Center  19.

In the playoff for first place between East Lake and Seminole, East Lake  won
4-2. East Lake's Angie Dunham, Sue Delie, Trish Mainard and Janet Loomis  scored
wins; Laura Silva and Laura Rustin won for Seminole.

GIRARDI ADVANCES: Phil Girardi, a USPTR certified teaching professional,  was
promoted to the head of program development and general manager at  Angelelli
World of Tennis.

In addition, Girardi will continue teaching at both Pasadena Yacht and  Country
Club and Treasure Island Tennis and Golf Club. For activity  information, call
347-3084.

JUNIOR OPEN IN ST. PETERSBURG: The St. Petersburg Tennis Center is  registering
until June 19 for its June 22-24 state-sanctioned junior singles  and doubles
tournament.

For information, call tournament director Al Sarmiento at 360-2643 or the

TENNIS; Pro's actions speak louder than words

BYLINE: Rod Carlyletennis

SECTION: EXTRA; SECTION J; PAGE 04

LENGTH: 273 words


The most important part of a teaching pro's job is to be able to give the same
instruction several different ways.

By conveying certain concepts to a student you may be able to correct bad habits
much more quickly than sticking to the same words.

An example is the phrase "take your racket back."

Everyone is told this from the first day they pick up a racket. However, this
can be interpreted to mean different things to different people.

The elements involved include turning your shoulders and having your racket hand
in the proper position. Many people actually stick their arm straight back,
which actually is taking their racket back, but not what you really want to do.

If you will study pictures of the really good players, you will see that they
actually turn their shoulders at least until they are at right angles to the
net, if not more. This not only gets their rackets in position to hit the ball,
but also enables them to generate great power into the ball.

The second thing to notice is that their arms are bent, usually at a 90-degree
angle at the elbow, and their forearms are almost touching their bodies. This
also helps generate power by enabling the stroker to start the swing by snapping
the arm straight to begin the swing, thus generating great racket-head speed.

So the next time a friend or pro says to you, "Get your racket back," remember
what they mean.

LAS VEGAS -- Andre Agassi nearly lost two special rackets at a benefit auction
before his wife, Steffi Graf, bought them for $360,000 US.

In the live auction before Agassi's 11th Grand Slam for Children on Saturday at
the MGM Grand Garden Arena, the retired tennis star was almost ready to donate
the racket with which he won his first professional match, and the racket he
used in his final U.S. Open.

Bidding topped $320,000 before Graf intervened.

"Those rackets are supposed to stay with us," she said.

USA Adult League teams are battling in postseason

BYLINE: NANCY MORGAN

SECTION: NEIGHBORHOOD TIMES; Pg. 18

LENGTH: 1063 words


USA Adult League Tennis playoffs are under way. Area winners advance to regional
competition next month with hopes of reaching state and national championships.

Among the first to claim a division title were the St. Petersburg Country Club
2.5 and Royal Racquet Club 4.5 women's teams. This month, Countryside Mayhew
captured the women's 3.0 crown and Phil Green Tennis Academy 4.0.

St. Petersburg CC, the spring winner, beat fall champion Renaissance Vinoy 3-0
on the play of Lynne Steinweer in singles and Laurin Fronduto-Weir and Ada
Bussey in No. 1 doubles and Larene Guerrier and Karen O'Connell at No. 2.

The women's 4.5 championship came down to the season's final match. Tied with a
2-2 record, Royal Racquet beat the Vinoy 4-1.Lynn Sayler and Lara Cavanaugh (No.
3 doubles) scored the Vinoy's only points.

In the women's 3.0 four-team playoff, Countryside Mayhew eliminated Safety Nets
with a 4-1 victory and Countryside Walker defeated McMullen 3-2 to reach the
final. Countryside Mayhew won 4-1 over Countryside Walker.

Unbeaten PGTA first topped the Royal Challengers 3-2, and second-place Treasure
Bay defeated Royal Racquet 4-1 to face off in the women's 4.0 championship.

PGTA survived three third-set tie-breakers to beat Treasure Bay 4-1. Producing
Treasure Bay points were Susan Hobbs and Turtle Marshall at No. 3 doubles.

The Royal Challengers beat Royal Racquet 3-2 to finish third.

In 3.5 play, Feather Sound (9-0) is the top seed for its four-team playoff this
weekend.

"Our team has done well, and it's been a real easy team to captain," Feather
Sound's Carol Stowasser said. "We've been together a long time and are friends,
which makes it easy, too.

"We've had opportunities to go to regionals in the past, at the 3.0 and 3.5
levels, and we hope to go there and beyond this year," she said.

Vinoy (6-3) will challenge Feather Sound on Saturday, and East Lake Woodlands
(6-3) takes on McMullen (7-2). The winners meet Sunday for the division title.

Men's competition started last weekend for the top four 3.5 squads while the
second round of 4.0 was played.

In the 3.5 round robin, Shipwatch beat the Racquet Club 3-2, St. Petersburg
Tennis Center defeated Shipwatch 3-2 and McMullen turned back Racquet Club 4-1.

"We first had to play East Lake to even get into the playoffs," SPTC captain Art
Carta said. "We were tied in overall record for the fourth playoff spot. We beat
them 3-2, and it came down to the final match in No. 1 doubles."

SPTC again stretched the outcome down to the last match against Shipwatch, this
time in No. 2 singles with Matt Wilson.

Carta and Sonny DePadua posted the first victory, in No. 3 doubles, before
Joseph Bulone tied the score with a two-set win for Shipwatch in No. 1 singles.
Les Spang and John Sturgis won for Shipwatch in No. 1 doubles, but SPTC evened
it at 2 with a victory from John Green and Dale Reed in No. 2 doubles. Wilson
clinched it for SPTC with a 6-2, 6-3 decision.

"We were on the bottom of the heap last year, so it felt good to win," Carta
said. "We have a couple of different guys this year and good team chemistry.
We're looking forward to playing."

Shipwatch beat the Racquet Club behind Bulone in No. 1 singles and John Main and
Alan Smith at No. 2 doubles. John Todia collected a win by default. Duane
Dannels and Paul Hagglund (No. 1 doubles) and Neel Voss and Paul Stewart (No. 2)
posted wins for the Racquet Club.

McMullen defeated the Racquet Club 4-1, with David Laesser collecting the only
victory with a No. 2 singles decision for the St. Petersburg club.

In men's 4.0, Seminole and McMullen have beaten the Racquet Club and the Vinoy
and are set to play at 11 a.m. Saturday at Seminole to determine the overall
champion.

A rain-postponed match between Feather Sound and Royal Racquet in the 3.0
division is to be completed this weekend before the division winner can be
determined.

In men's 4.5, a showdown between fall winner Royal Racquet and spring champion
PGTA is to begin at noon Saturday at PGTA.

Division winners advance to USA Tennis Florida's West Regional Championships,
July 14-17 in Naples.

NEW AT TREASURE ISLAND: This month, Jose Campos of Lutz assumed the tennis
director position at the club. Campos, an accomplished player in the Open
division, was the head teaching professional at Cheval Country Club in Lutz for
more than 10 years. Former Treasure Island Tennis and Yacht Club director Scott

this fall.

CHARITY TOURNEY: Winning Open division teams of Janet Eschenroeder and Turtle
Marshall (women's competition), Jane Robinson and Adrian Pagani (mixed) and
Rafael Muzquiz and Gregg Strange (men) were stretched to three sets in the
Arthritis Charity Tournament at East Lake Woodlands last month. Jenny Bell and
Missi Hayslett won women's 3.5 in straight sets, as did Kim Damico and Mary

MAMARONECK: INJUNCTION GRANTED

The State Supreme Court in White Plains has granted a preliminary injunction
barring the village of Mamaroneck from giving a contract to a Long Island
developer, Sportime, for a sports complex at Harbor Island Park. The current
operator of the tennis courts in the park, Harbor View Racquet Club, had a right
of first refusal, which the court upheld. The village had argued that Harbor
View lacked the money and expertise to build the new facility. "We're looking
into an appeal," Steven Silveberg, the village attorney, said.   ROBERT WORTH

NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: FORT GREENE;
A Tennis Club (And Magnet) Risks Oblivion

BYLINE: By LYNETTE HOLLOWAY

SECTION: Section 13; Page 10; Column 3; The City Weekly Desk

LENGTH: 553 words


Seated on a red-brick terrace overlooking the small red-clay tennis empire he
spent 12 years building, Richard Northern pondered two questions: "Why can't we
stay? And why can't they build around us?"

His South Oxford Health and Racquet Club is the city's only black-owned tennis
club. It is also a popular neighborhood center of social and political activity.
Come November, though, the four outdoor tennis courts and the three-story
neo-Georgian building on the fringe of the Fort Greene Historic District are to
be demolished to make room for moderate- to middle-income housing, part of
Atlantic Center, a commercial- and residential-development plan.

The city, which owns the club's property, has offered to help Mr. Northern move.
But he has begun a letter-writing campaign, hoping to put pressure on officials
to include the building in the redevelopment plan. He has also has taken steps
to get the building landmarked, which would make it harder to tear it down.

"This club is like a little oasis," Mr. Northern said, surveying the tennis
courts, bordered by swirls of razor wire. "I'm a struggling businessman. I've
invested most of my money into this building. I have no choice but to fight to
keep the club here."

But a spokeswoman for the Department of Housing Preservation and Development,
Valerie Jo Bradley, insisted that the club cannot remain there. The building,
she said, is on 20 abandoned acres of city land that for seven years have been
intended for redevelopment. Referring to Mr. Northern, she said:

"He went into the deal with full knowledge that the land was going to be used
for future housing. We want to work with him to see that the club finds a
feasible relocation site because it does provide a good service. It just can't
stay where it is."

Community sentiment about the club, at 187 South Oxford Street next to a weedy
vacant lot off Atlantic Avenue, is somewhat mixed. Community Board 2 approved
the plan for 130 owner-occupied, three-family condominiums. But Evelyn Williams,
district manager of the board, said she had received calls from residents who
felt that closing the club would be a great loss to the neighborhood.

Mr. Northern, a veteran tennis pro, and four partners agreed with the city in
1981 to lease the property on a month-to-month basis for $550. He spent $400,000
over 12 years refurbishing the building, which was put up in 1926 and had since
fallen into disrepair. As time wore on, Mr. Northern became attached to the
building, wanting more than a month-to-month lease, and twice offered to buy it.
The city never responded, he said.

Over the years, the club, physically part of the building, has become a social
center with 85 members, half of them black and the other half white. Members
include City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman and Paul Robeson Jr. Ronald T.
Gault, a financier and former city official who is a member of Mayor David N.
Dinkins's committee on appointments, has played at the club. The Rev. Al
Sharpton used the club as primary-night headquarters last year. On Saturdays,
Mr. Northern holds free clinics for neighborhood children.

"Tennis is very important to me," he said, "because it kept me out of trouble
while I was growing up. I want to do the same for the children in this
community." LYNETTE HOLLOWAY

Players Helped by Products (at Least They Think So)

In recent years there has been a proliferation of so-called smart rackets and
other high-tech gadgets, including Sony's Smart Tennis Sensor and Babolat's Play
racket, that compile data on strokes. This fall, Babolat will introduce POP, a
wristband that will provide similar analysis when used with any racket.

Those advances in racket technology range in price from $90 to $250, but many
cheaper accessories nibble at the edges, less likely to give a top pro an edge
than to be bought by a club player looking for a slight boost or protection
against injury.

''The equipment is so inexpensive compared to other sports that you can
experiment without it costing an arm and a leg,'' said Jack Lee, 49, an
electrical engineer from Arlington, N.Y.

Do these accessories help? Or are they placebos? I asked several advanced
recreational players and experts in the tennis equipment industry about their
experiences with some popular products.

VIBRATION DAMPENERS These plastic doodads that fit between the two center main
strings at the bottom of the string bed have graced the rackets of Novak
Djokovic and Pete Sampras. Andre Agassi preferred a knotted rubber band.

Dampeners are the most prevalent tennis accessories, in the traditional button
style and the snake, which weaves in and out of the strings.

A dampener lowers the intensity of the vibrations felt in a player's arm, Daniel
Becker, senior marketing manager for Babolat USA, said in an email.

But some experts, like Todd Snyder, a teaching pro in Brooklyn, say that while
many club-level players believe the dampeners protect their arms, it is merely
wishful thinking.

''They do exactly what they're supposed to -- dampen the string vibrations,''
said Bob Patterson, special projects manager at the United States Racquet
Stringers Association. ''But to reduce the shock, you need to dampen the frame
vibration. String vibration is mostly noise -- if your racket creates a pingy
sound, it can be annoying, and this changes the sound.''

Lee, who uses dampeners, said he liked the ''satisfying thwack'' sound. But
Angus Wong, 30, a financial analyst in San Francisco, said he stopped using a
dampener when he realized that it made ''every single hit feel and sound like
you hit the ball solidly, whether you hit it in the center or if it was a
mishit.''

The two-time United States Open champion Tracy Austin never used dampeners. But
many players, including her son, she said, start using them as children because
they look ''cool and fun,'' and then it becomes a habit.

Some people use dampeners, well, just because. ''The pro at my club said I need
it,'' said Cathy Fiore, 55, from Point Pleasant, N.J. ''I don't know anyone at
the club who doesn't have one. But there's not a lot of discussion. If our pro
got a new racket, the next thing you know, there'd be 100 women at the club
using that racket.''

DEAD FRAMES The best way to protect your arm is with a racket designed to deaden
frame vibrations. Many racket manufacturers make such models, like Wilson's
Triad, Prince's O-Ports and Dunlop's new iDapt racket, which enables players to
customize certain aspects, including cushioning.

Wilson also makes Shock Shield ($7.95), an overgrip with a cushioning gel that
players can wrap on the racket handle.

''The trade-off is that upper-level players want feedback on their shots and
don't want to have everything dampened,'' Patterson said.

Michael Schaeffer, Wilson's product line manager for strings and grips, said,
''Players like and need feedback and don't really enjoy a dead frame unless it
relates to their health.''

KINESIOLOGY TAPE Stretchy adhesive strips designed to protect injuries without
restricting motions, kinesiology tape has become increasingly popular with pros
and amateurs.

Clay Sniteman, a physical therapist and medical director for the ATP Tour, said
the tape ($19.99) was less restrictive and easier to individualize than a brace
or old-fashioned hard tapes.

He said the tape did more than protect injured areas; it could also help heal. A
player with a kneecap problem can use the tape to help improve the leg's
biomechanics ''until the knee is back inside the groove,'' Sniteman said.

Fiore added, ''I had tennis elbow two years ago and wore KT Tape in two strips,
and the pain went away.''

Others think much of the benefit is simply a placebo effect. Wong said that
using the tape after rotator cuff surgery ''helped me mentally to think that
something was holding my joint together without hindering my range of motion --
and in tennis the mental aspect is so important.''

STRING SAVERS These plastic attachments to the strings ($4.99 and up) hold them
in place to reduce friction, and thus wear and tear. Put them on a racket, and
strings can be replaced less often.

But by holding the strings in place, Patterson said, the string savers reduce
the ''snap back'' that most experts say is crucial for creating topspin.

LEAD TAPE There is no arguing with lead tape ($2.50 and up). Everyone agrees: If
you add it to the hoop of the racket, the extra weight will provide more power.
But some people do not feel comfortable using lead and prefer spending more to
buy tungsten strips or pads ($9.95 and up).

Patterson cautioned using lead tape around children, and Wong warned of other
unsafe uses.

''Lead is a carcinogen, but you're not licking it, so it's safe,'' he said.

Tennis shop closing as Mundorff rides off into sunset

Sept. 26--By John Reid

Daily News Staff Writer

John Mundorff is retiring. The tiny space at 533A Ramona Ave. in Palo Alto will
never be the same after Mundorff closes its doors Tuesday.

For decades, Mundorff has strung tennis rackets at The Racket Web, a 180-square
foot hole-in-the-wall in the same building as Nola Restaurant.

Mundorff and his wife, Kathie, recently celebrated their 47th wedding
anniversary.

"Kathie has been retired five years and she wants me to join her," Mundorff
said. "We can walk and talk and play some tennis together."

John Mundorff was born in Pensacola, Fla. He originally went to high school in
Sacramento, but moved to Belmont for his senior year, graduating from Carlmont
in 1965. Mundorff met Kathie at the College of San Mateo.

The couple started stringing rackets together when they were in their 20s,
inspired by a visit to a JC Penney store in the old Mayfield Mall in Mountain
View, circa 1976.

"We bought a couple of cheap rackets and there was no one there to help us,"
Mundorff said. "We soon realized the equipment wasn't very good. It was twangy
and kept slipping."

Mundorff looked up a business in Menlo Park called, "The Racket Workshop," run
by former Stanford tennis star Alan Margot, who played professionally.

"Alan did a real good job stringing our rackets," Mundorff said. "We saw what a
difference it made."

Mundorff returned to The Racket Workshop to get more work done and was asked by
Margot if he wanted to learn how to string rackets. Mundorff was between jobs at
the time and accepted Margot's invitation.

"I worked for him for a couple years," Mundorff said. "We were working on wood
rackets where you had to drill and burn them, do all kinds of things with your
hands. He was very good at what he did and passed it on to me."

Margot grew tired of fighting the magazine trade, which offered the same service
for less. Margot attempted to sell the business.

"At the time, he wanted $25,000," Mundorff said. "It might as well been a
million for me, so I told him I couldn't afford it."

Mundorff and Kathie were walking around in downtown Palo Alto one day when they
discovered the spot on Ramona Avenue. A business arrangement was made and The
Racket Web was born.

Mundorff soon struck up a relationship with the Stanford tennis program. The
relationship lasted 33 years, finally stopping a couple of years ago.

"When I was stringing Stanford rackets, I'd come in on weekends and work all
hours," Mundorff said. "Players don't get their rackets restrung only when their
strings break. Players that play at a high level, like Stanford guys, want fresh
rackets for every match. They like a certain feel. Some kids now go through at
lot of strings because they put a lot of spin on the ball."

Over the years, Mundorff developed a great relationship with Dick Gould,
Director of Tennis at Stanford and legendary men's tennis coach.

"John is not just a racket stringer," said Gould of Mundorff. "As one of my guys
aptly put it, rather he is a craftsman -- an artisan. John is the most loyal
person you will ever meet. He took a personal interest in all of our guys. They
loved him as a person and respected his knowledge and expertise. He was truly
one of the most valuable members of our team. We all feel John's retirement is
like losing our best friend."

"Dick Gould is an amazing man," Mundorff said. "About 15 years ago, my wife had
a heart attack. I called Dick to tell him and he was over here like that, giving
me support and comfort. As soon as my wife could have visitors, Dick was the
first to visit her. It made her so happy to see him. I'm sure that helped in her
recovery. He's that kind of guy."

Mundorff recalled watching a match at Stanford before the creation of Taube
Family Stadium.

"We were sitting in these old bleachers," Mundorff said. "Dick Gould came over
and yelled at us to get down on the court and root for one of his players who
was having a tough time."

Mundorff and his wife collected several old tennis cans, some dating back to the
'30s and '40s. Most of the tennis cans displayed in his shop are from the '50s,
'60s and '70s. One of the older cans was given by Gould to Mundorff after
Stanford won an NCAA tennis title in Athens, Ga.

Five years ago, tennis legend Jimmy Connors came into Mundorff's store, standing
right in front of the counter. Connors looked to the wall on his right and there
was a large poster of Bjorn Borg on his knees at the '78 Wimbledon final,
celebrating a 6-2, 6-2, 6-3 victory over Connors. The scoreboard is shown in the
background.

"Connors looked at that picture and his face turned red," Mundorff said. "He
said, 'That was such a dog match!' I saw that match on TV. Connors' forehand
wasn't working that great that day. He didn't like that picture at all. If I
knew he was coming, I would have put something over it."

Mundorff displays posters of Stanford greats, such as Kathy Jordan and Scott
Davis. It was Davis who brought Connors into the store.

"Kathy Jordan was probably the best female player to come out of college,"
Mundorff said.

Mundorff played a lot of tennis, enough to have two hips replaced and to have
had back surgery. Kathie plays tennis at level 4.0.

Mundorff praised his longtime landlord, Phyllis Muncie, for being kind to him.
Once, Mundorff was laid up after a hip replacement. Muncie called him up to
waive two months rent.

"The landlord has been awesome," Mundorff said. "They've given me a few extra
days to move out."

Reviews of The Racket Web on Yelp.com are glowing. One review from 2011 reads:
"I cannot say enough good things about this place. John is an expert on all
things tennis. I have had several racquets re-strung here and the quality of
work is simply marvelous. John ensures that the tension in the strings is
uniform across the face of the racquet, and when one hits the ball with such a
racquet the strings do not even shift. The difference while playing with such a
racquet is palpable!"

Innisbrook's mixed doubles loss opens door to tourney slightly

BYLINE: NANCY MORGAN

SECTION: NEIGHBORHOOD TIMES; TENNIS; Pg. 26

LENGTH: 565 words

DATELINE: CLEARWATER



Seminole Lake Racquet Club served Innisbrook its first loss of the season  last
week in a USTA/Florida Section District 12 Mixed 7.5 Doubles League  match.

Kathy O'Connell and Tony Henridon defeated Dale and Malcolm Slive in two  sets,
a tiebreaker in the second in the No. 2 position to give Seminole a 1-0  lead.

Micki and John Gelester lost 6-4, 6-2 in the No. 1 slot to Wendy Kall and
Reinhard Lauterbach to even the team score 1-1.

In the No. 3 position and the determining match, Mary Wilder and Scott  Maurer
overcame a first-set loss to win 3-6, 6-4, 6-4 over Maureen and Ron  Sternberg
to give Seminole a 2-1 team victory.

"This win will make it more exciting in the league," said Micki Gelester,
captain of the Seminole team. "I won't make any predictions, but we're going  to
try our darnedest."

Seminole has two losses - to Bardmoor and Eastlake Woodlands - as does  Bardmoor
- both to Innisbrook.

In last week's competition, Bardmoor defeated St. Petersburg Tennis Center  3-0.
Erika Boardman and Bob Simister defeated Simone O'Brien and George  Pequignot
6-4, 6-1 in No. 1 and Virginia Mauldin and Darwin Chee beat Hedy  Hunyady and
Morgan O'Brien 6-0, 6-1 in No. 2. Carol Kelly and Jim Foster won  in No. 3 for
Bardmoor by default.

Seminole plays Dunedin this week, followed by Royal Racquet Club and a  rematch
with Bardmoor March 7.

Bardmoor's other match is this week with Royal. Innisbrook meets St.  Petersburg
Tennis Center and Dunedin.

Although it appears Innisbrook will hold on to its top position in the 7.5
mixed doubles league and advance to the state tournament in May, players can
never be certain how the balls will land on a given day.

MCCAIN NAMED: Kelly McCain of Largo joins Saras Arasu of Saddlebrook and
Natalie Micholich of California on the USTA Girls 14-and-under National Team.
Recently, the team returned from France and this month will compete in
international tournaments in Brazil and Portugal.

COACHES DETERMINED: Teaching professionals Maria Cercone and Kevin Quay  have
been selected to coach various junior summer events. Cercone will coach  with
Sue Berke of Miami Beach, Kiko Castillo of Fort Myers and Ricardo Acuna  of
Ponte Vedra Beach in the USTA 16 Zone Team Championships while Quay will  join
Linsley McMillion of Pensacola, Fred Kangwa of Fort Myers, Danny Witt of
Jacksonville and Mike Kypriss of Pembroke Pines in the USTA 12 Zone Team
Championships.

SENIOR WOMEN: Lakewood improved its record to 6-1 with a 2-1 victory over  Isla
del Sol in the USTA/Florida Section Senior 3.5 Women's Doubles League  last
week. Seminole Lake beat the Racquet Club 2-1 in the 3.5 South division  to
raise its record to 5-1 while the Racquet Club fell to 5-2.

Innisbrook remains unbeaten in the 3.5 North division, as is Treasure  Island in
4.0.

SUPER SENIORS: Jack Mennis of St. Pete Beach won the men's 55 title in last
weekend's Super Seniors Championships at St. Petersburg Tennis Center. Mennis
defeated Joe Pundt of Sarasota in straight sets in the final. Carol Krebs of
Tierra Verde was a finalist in the women's 55, losing 6-0, 6-3 to Longwood's
Jane Fluet.

Other winners were Liz Leigh of Tampa (women's 45), Bill Cantrell of Tampa
(men's 45), Eric Handbury of Canada (men's 35), Alex Swetka of California
(men's 75) and Bill Herring of Arkansas (men's 65).

Squash: England facing a boycott

BYLINE: By RICHARD EATON

SECTION: SPORT PAGE; Page 33

LENGTH: 326 words


THE BOYCOTT of the English national championships, which most of the leading men
have been threatening for more than a month, became a certainty yesterday.
England is thus at risk of being without a proper team for both the world and
European championships.

The Squash Rackets Association is sticking to England team criteria linking
selection to participation in the nationals (one of the reasons for the
boycott), even though it withdrew its threat to cancel the men's national
championships in Manchester next week if the boycotters refused a peace plan.
All but the England captain, Phil Whitlock, did so, thus only two of the top 16
could be in today's draw, featuring 51 mostly lesser players.

''We remain disappointed that some of the top male players have decided not to
play, but respect their freedom to make their own decisions,'' Chris Gotla, the
SRA chief executive, said.

Another shift of policy, perhaps giving England a chance of defending the
world's silver medal position it achieved last time, may also be possible. Gotla
yesterday offered to host next month's players' meeting in London, and said that
England's selection criteria, like other SRA policies, were part of ''a review
process''.

If there is no change in this, the remarkable loyalty which Peter Marshall has
shown the rebels will be tested. The British national champion has supported the
boycott even though he, like Whitlock, agrees with the peace plan, and even
though he and England's No 2, Chris Walker, remain technically eligible for
selection by England because, by qualifying for the Super Series final in
Zurich, they gain exemption from the national championships.

Marshall says he agreed to abide by a players' majority vote and for this reason
has lent his name to the boycotting list. If players on this list are excluded
from consideration from England, then Marshall and Walker will refuse, so they
say, to play for their country.

Tennis shop closing as Mundorff rides off into sunset

John Mundorff is retiring. The tiny space at 533A Ramona Ave. in Palo Alto will

For decades, Mundorff has strung tennis rackets at The Racket Web, a

Stanford won an NCAA tennis title in Athens, Ga.

Five years ago, tennis legend Jimmy Connors came into Mundorff's store, standing
right in front of the counter. Connors looked to the wall on his right and there
was a large poster of Bjorn Borg on his knees at the '78 Wimbledon final,
celebrating a 6-2, 6-2, 6-3 victory over Connors. The scoreboard is shown in the
background.

"Connors looked at that picture and his face turned red," Mundorff said. "He
said, 'That was such a dog match!' I saw that match on TV. Connors' forehand
wasn't working that great that day. He didn't like that picture at all. If I
knew he was coming, I would have put something over it."

Mundorff displays posters of Stanford greats, such as Kathy Jordan and Scott
Davis. It was Davis who brought Connors into the store.

"Kathy Jordan was probably the best female player to come out of college,"
Mundorff said.

Mundorff played a lot of tennis, enough to have two hips replaced and to have
had back surgery. Kathie plays tennis at level 4.0.

Mundorff praised his longtime landlord, Phyllis Muncie, for being kind to him.
Once, Mundorff was laid up after a hip replacement. Muncie called him up to
waive two months rent.

"The landlord has been awesome," Mundorff said. "They've given me a few extra
days to move out."

Reviews of The Racket Web on Yelp.com are glowing. One review from 2011 reads:
"I cannot say enough good things about this place. John is an expert on all
things tennis. I have had several racquets re-strung here and the quality of
work is simply marvelous. John ensures that the tension in the strings is
uniform across the face of the racquet, and when one hits the ball with such a
racquet the strings do not even shift. The difference while playing with such a
racquet is palpable!"

FAMILY AFFAIR

Mom and Dad will help major league baseball get started next month. Now, Chelsea
Clinton has been invited to throw out the first ball for a minor-league team -
Daytona Cubs.

Jordan Kobritz, general manager of Chicago Cubs' farm team, said 13-year-old
Chelsea was asked to represent young Americans at the April 12 game.

U.S. President Bill Clinton will throw out the first ball in Baltimore for the
Orioles' opener and Hillary Rodham Clinton will do the honors in Chicago when
the Cubs open their season.

RACKET CRACKDOWN

Table tennis officials are cracking down on the use of glue and other solvents
which can improve the performance of rackets.

The executive committee of the International Table Tennis Federation announced
measures Tuesday aimed at preventing the use of illegal substances at the world
championships May 11-23 in Goteburg, Sweden.

The federation barred use of rackets which contain any aromatic or chlorinated
solvents. Only rubber adhesive will be permitted.

Random tests of rackets will be conducted during the early rounds of the world
championships, and rackets of all players will be tested during the late rounds.

BAIT FOR GOLFERS

The Deposit Guaranty Golf Classic, with a small purse and heavy competition from
the Masters, will go fishing for some PGA professionals. Literally.

The Hattiesburg, Miss., tournament, in its 26th year, will hold a fishing
tournament to entice golfers.

The tournament has a $ 300,000 US purse.

"They play for over $ 1 million just about everywhere else so we have to do
something to appeal to the players," said tournament director Robert Morgan. "We
have always depended on our hospitality. The fishing tournament is just another
way for us to be hospitable to the players."

JURY IS OUT

Winnipeg general manager Cal Murphy has heard the upbeat prognosis, but he
wonders if wide receiver Larry Thompson will recover from gunshot wounds in time
for Blue Bomber training camp in June.

"Especially when it's an injury to a bone in the upper leg," said Murphy. "You
carry a lot of weight on that part of the body."

HAPPY IN TEXAS

The boobirds in Oakland loved to rag Jose Canseco. So what's it like playing
with Texas Rangers?

"I've been treated really well in Texas. Not just by the organization, but by
the fans. There was one moment last year when I struck out for the second time
in a game. I was expecting to get booed. But that didn't happen. It was
something I hadn't heard in a long time. People were saying: 'That's OK, Jose.
Get 'em next time.' That made me feel so good. That's probably one of the
biggest things that made me stay. The fans realize that I'm not a robot."

Elbow Room For British Tennis

BYLINE: Carolyn O'Grady

SECTION: PE/SPORT; CLASS RESOURCE; No.4556; Pg.6

LENGTH: 361 words


A new nationwide initiative that aims to identify and nurture Britain's tennis
stars of the future has been launched by Tim Henman, Britain's number one tennis
player.

The initiative is being run by 18 Esporta Racquets Academies in the UK, an
offshoot of Esporta health clubs. The venture is also supported by the Tennis
First Charitable Trust, of which Henman is a patron.

Tennis coaches from the clubs will form links with local schools with a view to
providing tailor-made tennis provision for pupils. Talented children will be
invited to become members of the Racquets Academies and will be helped with
coaching, trips in the UK and abroad, and equipment if necessary. (Usually,
children can only join with their parents, but this stipulation will be waived.)
According to Henman, the emphasis would be placed on encouraging children from
poorer backgrounds. "Tennis in the UK is far too often perceived as an elitist
sport for privileged children," he said. "We want to broaden its appeal."

The scheme was targeting schools and younger children because "giving children
opportunities at an early age is important - otherwise we lose them to other
sports", he said.

The scheme has already been in operation at the Chiswick Racquets Academy, where
current young stars include Joe Salisbury, 11, who is ranked joint number one in
Britain in his age group.

Joe has represented Great Britain against top players of the same age from other
countries, and reached the finals of the 11-and-under national clay court
championships this summer. He is a "scholarship player" at the Chiswick Racquets
Academy, and attends King's College Junior School in Wimbledon.

"I come out of games to practice at the club," he said. "If I didn't come here
I'd have to go quite a long way to, say, the county centre. It's easy to get
here and I get expert coaching."

Esporta Racquets Clubs are located in Berkshire, Brentwood, Brighton, Cardiff,
Chiswick, Coventry, Croydon, Glasgow, Grimsby, Hamilton, Litchfield, Manchester,
Northwood, Oxford, Poole, Southampton, Sunderland and Swansea.

CULLEN'S SUPERLEAGUE HOPES DASHED AT THE NEC

SECTION: Pg. 27

LENGTH: 907 words


American millionaire businessman Blake Cullen's hopes of fielding a Birmingham
Superleague team for next season have been dashed by the National Exhibition
Centre's contractual obligations.

Cullen has always been favourite to run a Birmingham club and last week was
involved in lengthy negotiations with Superleague chief executive Ian Taylor and
NEC events director Linda Barrow.

His expertise stems from an 11-year association with Major League Baseball club
Chicago Cubs, where he was assistant general manager and vice-president.

He also then spent 11 years helping to run the National League office of Major
League before moving into ownership, firstly with Minor League clubs and then
until recently an eight-year spell of ice hockey's Hampton Roads Admirals in
Virginia.

Cullen had been eager to switch his talent and money to across the Atlantic and
in particular with a team in the second city, quickly following the lead taken
by the owners of the Los Angeles Kings, who were recently awarded the London
franchise.

After initially being rejected by the National Indoor Arena "my first choice
venue" who refused to lay down permanent ice for a variety of reasons, Cullen
then turned to the NEC.

Change in seedings

Defending champions Jansher Khan and Michelle Martin have been seeded second by
Squash Rackets Association for the British Open Championships.

Jansher has been overtaken as men's top seed by Scotland's Peter Nicol, whom the
Pakistani beat in last year's final to clinch a sixth successive title.

Nicol has since beaten Jansher four times to become the first Briton to be
officially ranked world No 1.

Martin has won the last five British Open Finals, lately against her Australian
compatriot Sarah Fitz-Gerald, the world No 1 and world champion, who has beaten
her in just about everything over the past two years except this premier
tournament.

Grass roots boost

Small hall boxing in the West Midlands will get another boost next month when
Dave Bradley joins the ranks of promoters bidding to keep the sport alive at
grass roots level.

Bradley, who has previously been best known as the manager of highly-rated
Stourbridge cruiserweight Robert Norton, puts on his first show at West Bromwich
Baths on Friday, April 3.

Norton will be topping the bill against an as yet un-named opponent, while the
rest of the bill will be packed with local fighters.

Leicester's chance

Leicester coach Dean Richards has urged his under-strength side to take
advantage of an unexpected opportunity to impress when they line up against the
Barbarians at Welford Road today.

International calps and injuries have weakened both sides, meaning today's match
has lost some of the edge it had when it used to be staged over Christmas.

But former England No 8 Richards has told those players who are in the Tigers
side to grab the chance with both hands.

"It's a great opportunity for them. Some of the boys never thought they would
turn out against the Barbarians," said Richards.

Moor to see

Moor Green will look forward to an eye-catching friendly with a West Bromwich
Albion XI tonight at the Moorlands (7.30).

Mims hits out

Greater London Leopards coach Billy Mims hit out at England centre John Amaechi
yesterday over the star's relentless criticism of the English Basketball
Association.

Mims, whose club are top of the table and attempting to defend their Budweiser
League title, argued that the former NBA player's expectations of the cash
-strapped EBBA were too high.

And if the EBBA asked him to be a part-time England boss, he "would do the job
for nothing as long as they paid my expenses."

Mims dismissed the frustration expressed by Amaechi and other players that
national team members received only pounds 15 per day on their trip to Eastern
Europe.

The complaint was one of many listed in a public statement condemning the EBBA
for failing to support the national team.

"It's a sad day in sports when you get guys saying 'We're going to do it my way
or we aren't going to do it at all,"' Mims said.

Johnston foiled

Former world indoor bowling champion Margaret Johnston from Ballymoney was
foiled in her bid for a record equalling third British Indoors singles title
when she went down 21-11 to Scotland's Caroline McAllister.

Johnston, a twice former world champion, trailed 0-13 after just eight ends in
the British womens championships in Darlington.

And the Scot, who lost out in last year's final, went on to a comfortable 21 -11
victory.

Scotland made it a double success when Elizabeth Herd and Cath McIntosh from
Stonehaven coasted to the pairs. They defeated Belfast's Vera McCourt and Audrey
Doggart 27-17.

And England's Kath Hubbard, Di Rose and Doreen Miller from March in
Cambridgeshire captured the triples crown.

Offiah's date wth Wigan

Former Wigan favourite Martin Offiah is relishing a clash with his old team
-mates after London Broncos were paired with the hot favourites in the semi
-finals of the Silk Cut Challenge Cup.

The big guns came out of the hat together while Sheffield Eagles like London in
the last four for the first time in their 14-year history were paired with
Salford Reds.

Offiah, who collected four Wembley winners' medals during his glorious spell
with the Central Park giants, admitted that he would have had preferred to have
avoided Wigan until the final.

Sundance could lose Racquet Club theater: Upcoming renovation will make it
difficult to show movies there

BYLINE: Jay Hamburger, Park Record, Park City, Utah

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 453 words


Jan. 27--The renovation of the Racquet Club, planned to start as early as May,
will make it difficult for Sundance Film Festival organizers to use the facility
as they do now, the City Hall official who is leading the efforts to redo the
building said.

Sundance turns the gymnasium at the Racquet Club into a screening room during
the festival. The organizers also tap the tennis courts for the festival's
awards ceremony.

Under the renovation plans, it seems that there will be significant logistical
problems for Sundance. The site would be a major construction zone during the
2011 festival and work could be continuing during the 2012 edition if there are
delays. The work is projected to last 18 months, City Hall says.

Sundance has used the gymnasium as a screening room since 2005.

The plans envision razing the tennis courts where the awards ceremony is held
and rebuilding a new set of courts. The gymnasium where the screenings take
place is the only section of the existing Racquet Club that will not be torn
down during the work. But it is not clear whether Sundance could use the
gymnasium for screenings while the work is occurring around the gym.

Ken Fisher, who manages City Hall's recreation programs and is heavily involved
in the talks about the Racquet Club renovation, said officials have started
discussions with Sundance organizers about the work.

Sundance typically reviews the operations of the festival annually, and
organizers sometimes add a screening room, drop

one or shuffle the way some are used. Sundance officials recently indicated they
would discuss the Racquet Club situation after this year's festival.

Holding 602 seats, the Racquet Club gymnasium is a crucial theater for Sundance.
Of the Park City-area theaters, only the Eccles Center has a larger capacity.

City Hall plans to spend $10.5 million on the renovation, meant to update the
aging facility with numerous new recreation offerings and environmental
upgrades. The Park City Planning Commission this month approved the renovation.

Many Racquet Club users have said the work is needed to turn the facility into a
more desirable place for workouts. Some people who live nearby, though,
indicated in hearings the redone building will be too large and the Racquet Club

Two Pinellas men's teams advance to nationals

BYLINE: NANCY MORGAN

SECTION: NEIGHBORHOOD TIMES; TENNIS; Pg. 18

LENGTH: 590 words



The Racquet Club of St. Petersburg's 3.5 team and Feather Sound Country Club's
3.0 squad won adult league state titles over the weekend and will challenge for
a national title in Tucson in October.

Two adult men's teams from Pinellas qualified for the U.S. Tennis Association
national championships by winning state titles last weekend in Orlando.

Two others came close, finishing second.

The Racquet Club of St. Petersburg's 3.5 team and Feather Sound Country Club's
3.0 squad will challenge for a national title in Tucson, Ariz., in October.
Bardmoor Golf and Tennis Club's 4.0 men's team and Isla Del Sol Country Club's
5.5 squad both tied for first place with two other teams but were edged out
under a tiebreak system.

"We're euphoric," said Bob Dickerson, captain of the Racquet Club state
champions. "At the beginning of the local season, I teased that if players
wanted to go to Tucson to be on our team. Now that's really where we're going."

At the state tournament, the Racquet Club first played Daytona Beach and won 5-0
on the singles play of Mike Williams and John McQuillen and doubles success of
Scott Stewart and Scott Johnston in No. 1, Dickerson and Steve Uebel in No. 2,
and Jack Weldon and Earl Gehant in No. 3.

"The competition was very good in all three matches, even if the score doesn't
look like it," added Dickerson. "After the first match, we thought this
experience wasn't so bad since it was our first time at state, although we knew
that our next match with Ocala would be a battle all the way - and it was."

Ocala had been to the state tournament the last two years and was the most
experienced team the Racquet Club would face. Williams and McQuillen again
played incredible matches, said Dickerson, and Stewart and Johnston won again in
No. 1 doubles to clinch a 3-2 team victory.

The third and final match for the Racquet Club was against a team from Broward
County, which already had two losses. Williams won his third consecutive match
in No. 1 singles, as did Stewart and Johnston in No. 1 doubles. Weldon and
Gehant won again in No. 3, and Dickerson teamed with Bob Wahl to win at No. 2.

"To win feels really good," said Dickerson, "and we're going to continue to
drill and play as much as we can on the hard courts until nationals. If we're in
good condition, we'll give it a good shot."

Rounding out the Racquet Club team are Jeff Doty, Neil Voss, Vaughn Haight, Ray
Cianci and George Ethan Ray.

Feather Sound's 3.0 men's team defeated teams from Miami (3-2), Jacksonville
(4-1) and Naples (4-1) to advance.

JUNIORS AT NATIONALS: Former St. Petersburg resident Kelly McCain finished third
in the girls 18-and-under division at the USTA National Championships this
month. Lori Grey reached the girls 18s doubles quarterfinals with Milangela
Morales of Miami.

Also, Sukhwa Young of Wesley Chapel won the boys 14s title; Aleksey Bubis and
Brandon Wagner reached the round of 16 in the 18s, and Ryler DeHeart advanced to
the round of 32 in the 16s singles and doubles.

TENNIS ON THE MOVE: St. Petersburg will be one of the first sites for a visit by
the USA Tennis on the Move mobile unit developed by Florida's USA Tennis
coordinator, Loretta Strickland. The unit is designed to be all-inclusive
regarding tennis equipment and suitable for hosting a tennis carnival throughout
the state.

The unit will be at Tyrone Square Mall on Sept. 18 and will offer a variety of
contests, target-hitting games and rally competition.

The operator of the tennis courts at Harbor Island Park in Mamaroneck lacks the
money or expertise to build the indoor courts and multisport center that the
village wants, the village said in papers filed in State Supreme Court in White
Plains. The village has asked the court to lift a temporary injunction barring
it from giving the contract to another developer, the Long Island-based
Sportime. The current operator, the Harbor View Racquet Club, has argued that
the contract was deliberately written to exclude it.   ROBERT WORTH

Squash Rackets: Squad train with a difference

BYLINE: COLIN MCQUILLAN

SECTION: Issue 62277.

LENGTH: 246 words


Bob Lincoln, the new national coach of the Squash Rackets Association, has come
up with a novel way of preparing his England under-19 squad for the junior world
championship in Australia next spring.

Unable to secure the finance to prepare the squad as he would wish, Lincoln is
busily entering members individually in any available tournament or competition.


Squad members have picked up an impressive number of local titles in the recent
round of closed county championships, and they decimated the South of England B
tournament at Brighton last week, which was won by Paul Gregory ahead of a trio
of under-19 semi-finalists.

Gregory, aged 17, the current champion of champions, is, along with other
members of the squad, busy again this week in the American Express premier
league.

Manchester Northern, still winning despite the absence of Geoff Williams, the
champion, regained the league leadership with a 4-1 win over Dunnings Mill. Only
Gregory resisted that onslaught, beating Mark Cull in straight games.

Ahmed Safwat, the brilliant but ageing Egyptian touch player, visited Redwood
Lodge in Bristol with an Ardleigh Hall squad that missed only Robert Graham from
the cream of Essex juniors. Del Harris, aged 16, beat Jonathan Cornish; Chris
Walker, aged 18, beat Luke Gojnic; and Richard Elliot, aged 20, beat Darren
Mabbs.

Safwat gained his own reverse satisfaction with a tidy dismissal of Hesham
el-Attarl, the Egyptian junior.

O'Connor back at Saddlebrook to make it the best

BYLINE: NANCY MORGAN

SECTION: SEMINOLE TIMES; TENNIS; Pg. 4

LENGTH: 835 words



Kevin O'Connor believes competition improves quality. The recently named
director of sports marketing for Saddlebrook Resort seeks to make the resort
the benchmark name among tennis facilities.

"My goal is for Saddlebrook not to be grouped in a barrel with all the  other
academies," explained O'Connor. "We can be reference points. This is  not an
accounting business; we just want to be the best in the business."

O'Connor, a 1983 graduate of Clearwater Central Catholic, first started
full-time at Saddlebrook in 1988 as tennis coordinator after graduation from
Loras College in Dubuque, Iowa, with a major in communication and minor in
marketing.

"I was really lucky," said O'Connor. "I've never interviewed for a job.  I had
helped and taught for Howard (Moore) and Tommy (Thompson) at Hopman's  during my
college breaks and summers."

In 1991, O'Connor left the resort in Wesley Chapel to be tennis director  for
the Palmer Tennis Academy in Tampa, and remained there until last  December.

"I was recruited away from the tennis industry to be the sports marketing
director for the Wizards of the Coast, a toy and game business," explained
O'Connor. "The Wizards were interested in co-branding with sports."

O'Connor journeyed to Seattle, Wash., to learn games and study sports
franchises. Something was missing, though, for the personable young
businessman.

"The work was interesting, but I was always dealing with products and not
people," said O'Connor. "That was not fufilling - I want to make a  difference
in people's lives through tennis."

This past April while in California to see tennis professional Scott  Humphries,
whom he has coached the past 11 years, O'Connor learned that John  Evert (Chris'

 brother) had left his position at Saddlebrook as director of  sports marketing.
It was then O'Connor knew he wanted - needed - to get back  into tennis.

A meeting with Thompson at the Easter Bowl in Palm Springs, Calif.,  resulted in
interviews at Wesley Chapel with Moore and Saddlebrook owner Tom  Dempsey. Last
month, O'Connor began his new position.

"I'm back home even though I'm in a different position," said O'Connor.  "My
past history here will help me in the goal of making our programs the  best."

O'Connor, who turned 30 at the end of May, plans to make tennis at  Saddlebrook
more user-friendly, especially at the state and local levels.

For more information on tennis programs there, call 973-1111.

ADULT LEAGUE UPDATE: Women's playoffs begin Saturday for the 3.5 and 4.0
divisions. In the 3.5 competition, Countryside hosts Innisbrook and Bardmoor
hosts East Lake. East Lake travels to McMullen in 4.0.

The Racquet Club of St. Petersburg opened play in the 4.5 men's division
Saturday with a 4-1 victory over Royal Racquet. Captain Jim Cohen and Jim
Hartley Jr. won in singles, Brian Smith and Steve Reilly in No. 1 doubles, and
Mitch Lee and Hernan Molina in No. 3 doubles.

SUNCOAST SINGLES: East Lake Woodlands tied Seminole Lake Racquet Club with  48
points in the seven-team Suncoast Singles League for women. Royal Racquet  Club
earned 47 points, Bardmoor Tennis and Fitness Club and the Racquet Club  of St.
Petersburg 30, Tierra Verde 23, and the St. Petersburg Tennis Center  19.

In a playoff last weekend, East Lake defeated Seminole 4-2 to win the  league
title. East Lake's Angie Dunham, Sue Delie, Trish Mainard and Janet  Loomis
scored wins; Laura Silva and Laura Austin won for Seminole.

JUNIOR TITLEISTS: Five Pinellas players won singles titles in last month's  End
of School Classic Tournament at East Lake Woodlands. Adrian Pagani won the  boys
18 division, Aleksi Bubis the boys 16 and Billy Stagg the boys 10, all in
straight sets. Sisters Lori and Christa Grey won the girls 16 and 18 titles
respsectively.

Local consolation winners included Kyle Nelson, Mark Brown, Michelle Navas  and
Jennifer Dent.

Michael Murray of Clearwater, unseeded in the state-sanctioned junior
designated tournament at Plantation last month, reached the quarterfinals in
the boys 16 competition. Murray then lost to No. 2 seed Alan Bohane of West
Palm Beach in straight sets.

K-SWISS JUNIOR WINNERS: The Crescent Oaks 16s B team defeated Northdale of
Tampa 48-24 in the K-Swiss Junior Tournament held at Hunter's Green Racquet
Club last month.

Playing for the unbeaten Crescent Oaks team were Kerri Goldberg, Nicki  Days,
Natalie Lyman and Jason Ricci. Betty Langdon was the team captain.

East Lake Woodlands was runner-up in the 12s B competition, losing 40-21 to
Hidden Palms in the playoff.

ELEMENTARY FUN: The Second Annual Elementary School Fun Day was held on the
Fisher Field tennis courts in Dunedin last month for more than 120
fifth-graders from Sutherland, Sunset Hills, Garrison-Jones, and Highland
Lakes.

Assisting USTA area school coordinator Irene Tharin were Judy Murphy, Nancy
Kirsten, Andrea Morgan, Vince Trapano, Rafael Muzquiz and this writer.

Players play and racket evaluates

BYLINE: Mic Huber

SECTION: C; ARCHIVES; Pg. C01

LENGTH: 814 words


It had to happen.

In an increasingly social network driven world, it was just a matter of Internet
time until the tennis world caught up.

Say hello to a new tennis experience and greet a racket that connects players
with not only their inner selves but also with players around the globe.

The Babolat Play Pure Drive, the first connected tennis racket, recently made
its debut in Sarasota.

The racket looks like any other Babolat Pure Drive model, except for the bottom
on the handle ... and the price tag.

Through the racket may not appear revolutionary at a quick glance, it allows
players to track the way they play tennis, review how they hit the tennis ball,
while adding the ability to share and compare their experience with other
players in the "Babolat Community."

"It is really a cool thing and can really help a player change and improve their
game," said Phil Perella, part-owner of Total Tennis, a racket and apparel shop
where a few of the new rackets reside.

Perella spent a couple of days recently in Colorado -- near the U.S.
headquarters of Babolat -- getting a crash course in the way the racket works.
Now he is the local distributor.

"It's more for people who play a lot than it is for someone just taking up the
game," Perella conceded about the racket, which has a suggested retail price of
$399.

What the racket won't do -- even at that price -- is magically make you hit like
Nadal or Federer. What it can do is help players incrementally improve their
game by providing feedback on how they hit the tennis ball, where they strike it
on their racket, along with providing a plethora of other statistics that can be
analyzed.

It also can give an overview on a player's game by tracking what shots are hit,
while examining endurance and tracking improvements.

Players who enjoy interacting on the Internet can compare data with other people
who use the racket and chart where they rank in various categories.

Players can even access the information courtside as long as they have a
smartphone and have downloaded the proprietary app. At the professional level,
an addition to rules in 2014 will allow players to use the racket in tournaments
but they are not allowed to have smartphones courtside so they will not have
access to immediate feedback.

Where it comes more into play is during training sessions, where players at any
level can stop and take a look at how and where on the racket they are hitting
shots.

The secret of the stick is in the handle, which is packed with sensors,
including a microprocessor able to translate and record data collected while a
player is taking part in a training session or playing a match.

The data can be downloaded to a smartphone, tablet or computer with a Bluetooth
connection or through a USB cable.

A player can quickly see impact location, how much spin they use, length of play
time and even how many shots they hit in a particular rally.

In a way, it is similar to when a player watches a video and finds out that what
they think they look like. Once you see what you are doing wrong, it is much
easier to begin making corrections.

That is partly the benefit of seeing the data. It senses whether you are hitting
forehands or backhands and whether you are hitting flat or topspin.

"I thought I was hitting with more topspin than I actually was," Perella said.

Even with a new, fancy, smartphone, an older player, like the 66-year-old
Perella, finds that the primary benefit is in seeing and believing and then
working on things like hitting more topspin by brushing up more on the tennis
ball.

For younger players, those who have grown up in a world of gaming and community
sharing, there is the added lure of communicating with like-minded people online
by comparing and competing.

The only difference from the regular racket is on the butt of the handle where
there are tiny buttons to turn on the sensors and the Bluetooth pairing
capability. Babolat, after six years of research, found a way to eliminate other
material so that the racket weight remains the same.

The app makes it easy to store performance history and chart changes and
progress.

It is not without a few glitches -- sometimes there is confusion about among
first and second serves and overheads as an example. But this is new and
evolving technology and there are certain to be software upgrades available in
the future.

Though the technology is currently limited to the Pure Drive racket model, it is
expected that Babolat will soon install it in other models.

For Perella, the current challenge is getting rackets into his store, one of 10
in the state of Florida, three on Florida's west coast that have access to the
racket.

He was provided 10 last month when the company released 500 world-wide. They are
almost gone. He will be able to get another 10 this month.

Already Perella has mastered using the racket, app, Bluetooth and smartphone.
Can Twitter be far behind?

She Does It Her Way

BYLINE: By BEN ROTHENBERG

SECTION: Section B; Column 0; Sports Desk; Pg. 14

LENGTH: 906 words


After Paula Ormaechea won her first-round match at the United States Open on
Monday, she saluted the crowd in an established way: raising both arms over her
head and tapping the strings of her racket against the palm of her hand.

Using a racket as an extension of the arm to mimic applause has been done for
many years, but few players have had quite the connection between their hands
and their rackets' strings that Ormaechea does. That is because Ormaechea, 20,
strings her own rackets by hand, forgoing the professional stringing services
provided by tournaments.

Ormaechea, who is from Sunchales, Argentina, began stringing her rackets when
she was 11 and has continued ever since. Because her town of 19,000 had few
courts and no racket-stringing services, her father bought a small portable
stringing machine and taught his daughter how to use it.

''He wasn't going to do it all the time,'' Ormaechea said with a smile.

Equipped for self-sufficiency, Ormaechea moved to Buenos Aires when she was 13
to continue her training. As she rose through the junior ranks and continued her
career as a professional, Ormaechea took her 13-pound machine along with her.

''It's quite easy,'' she said of traveling with the machine. ''It's just six
kilos less of clothes, and that's all.''

In New York, Ormaechea strings her rackets in the Manhattan apartment where she
is staying during the tournament. She normally listens to music by artists like
Coldplay and U2 while she works, sometimes singing along as she pulls her
1.25-gauge Luxilon string through the holes in the racket frame, first
installing the vertical strings (called the mains), then the horizontal strings
(called the crosses).

It usually takes Ormaechea 10 to 12 minutes to string a racket, she said, or up
to 15 minutes ''if I'm lazy.''

The average time it has taken the racket stringers this year at the United
States Open to complete a racket is 16 minutes.

Todd Mobley, the head stringer in a room filled with more than a dozen
professional stringers busily working on state-of-the-art digital machines, was
skeptical of the quality of stringing that Ormaechea was able to do in the times
she reported.

''There's a right way to string one and a wrong way to string one,'' he said.
''And you can speed up the time by double pulling the strings. The novice
usually does that and doesn't know it. And they're going to lose a lot of
tension when they do that. You have to pull every single string to get an
accurate string bit.''

Mobley said he thought that ''less than a handful'' of players at the Grand Slam
level strung their own rackets, citing excess baggage fees as a primary concern.

''I guess if you were playing Futures or Challengers, there are a lot of players
that do that,'' Mobley said. ''But once you get to the higher echelon of tennis,
usually you don't ever see it.''

Ormaechea said that self-stringing was more common in Argentina and that the
160th-ranked Argentine Guido Andreozzi was another player who strung his own
rackets.

Mobley said Ormaechea's self-stringing was probably detrimental to her tennis.

''I think they're actually hurting their game,'' he said of players who string
rackets themselves. ''If you leave it to the professionals, you get it narrowed
down to what your string depth reflection is. You can't get any better than
that.''

But Ormaechea said she enjoyed the consistency that came with stringing her own
rackets. She normally sets her machine to string at 50 pounds of tension,
sometimes slightly increasing the amount of tension if she is playing at high
altitude.

''I like it because I know that the tension will be always the same,'' she said.
''It's the same machine. When you travel to different places, it's always
different. The person who will do it is different, the machine, the tension will
be more or less. It's not always the same. So I'm used to it. I know that this
is my tension, and I like it that way, so I keep doing it.''

Ormaechea and her home-strung rackets have already produced strong results early
in her professional career. She made the final of the WTA tournament in Bogotá,
Colombia, in February, and at No. 71, she is the highest-ranked South American
woman on the tour. She faces No. 16 seed Sabine Lisicki, a runner-up at
Wimbledon this year, in a second-round match that was postponed to Thursday.

Though cost was initially a reason for Ormaechea to do her rackets herself, it
would seem to be less of an issue as she becomes a more established
professional. At the United States Open, tournament stringers charge $30 per
racket, a price that Mobley said was about average on the tour. Ormaechea has
already earned $151,710 in 2013 and has added at least $58,000 by making the
second round of the Open.

Ormaechea has also occasionally helped out other players when the professional
stringers were backlogged.

''If I have a friend who needs it, I did this a few times,'' she said. ''And
once I was bored and there was some players who needed it because the stringer
was pretty full, so I did it. But actually I don't like it. I like to do my
rackets, but no more than that.''

When she is stringing her own rackets each night before matches, there is a
certain peacefulness to the task.

''I like it,'' Ormaechea said of the process. ''I do it in my free time. I can
just think about making the racket, stringing the racket and nothing else.''

She added, ''It's just a few minutes, but it distracts me from everything.''

Head USA's president is a 'hands-on CEO'

BYLINE: By Mike Gorrell The Salt Lake Tribune

SECTION: BREAKING; Tourism; Business

LENGTH: 601 words


As new president of Head USA, Kevin Kempin was thrilled to see a photo of
company-sponsored skier Lindsey Vonn atop Monday's Salt Lake Tribune sports
page.

Not just because she bounced back from an arm injury to win a third World Cup
race in three days, but also because the Head brand name on her ski was
displayed prominently as Vonn waved to a crowd afterward.

To Kempin, a Salt Lake County resident who regularly commutes to various company
offices, the photo is symbolic of Head's successful re-emergence as a skiing
power, just as it was in the mid-1950s when Howard Head's company sold more
laminated metal skis in the United States and Europe than any other company.

"We got away from the things that made Head skis successful and are resurrecting
them," said Kempin, 50, a former Utah collegiate tennis player and coach who
rose to the top of the company's American operations through its racquet sports
division.

"My goal is to make skiing or tennis easier sports for recreational athletes to
play and enjoy," he told The Tribune on Monday. "Whether you're a 'C'-level
player or a guy just coming off the tour, you want your equipment to better your
performance. We're reconnecting our athletes and the passion we have to our
equipment."

With next month's Vancouver Olympics approaching and Head having high hopes for
strong performances by Vonn and skier Bode Miller, Kempin said, "We have a
chance to make a comeback on the ski side."

"We're not where we want to be yet," he added, citing a goal of elevating Head
from its current status as the No. 4-to-No. 6 U.S. ski company.

Head USA already is No. 2 in racquet sports behind Wilson, with U.S. sales of
almost $80 million.

It's a side of the business Kempin knows well. A Chicago native, he moved to
Utah with his parents for his senior year in high school and promptly won the
state's No. 1 singles tennis title for Jordan High School in 1976.

Kempin went on to play four years at Weber State before joining the professional
ATP tour, where "I made enough in tournaments to see Europe and spend nine
months there."

After that, he taught the University of Utah women's tennis team for three years
before taking over the men's team from legendary coach Harry James.

But coaching was "never the end game" for Kempin, who was steered toward a job
with Rossignol when the French ski company was moving into tennis in the
mid-'80s. After a short stint there, he moved to then industry-leading Prince
Manufacturing, where he rose to run the company's U.S. operations.

A change of corporate ownership persuaded Kempin to move in 1993 to Head's
racquet division. He played a key role in that company's 1999 acquisition of
Penn, merging its ball-making business with Head's strengths -- making racquets,
strings and footwear.

"It's been a great fit," said Kempin, noting Penn had a 50 percent share of the
U.S. tennis ball market and a 70 percent share in racquet balls. "It made a ton
of sense for our sales reps, our sponsored athletes and our teaching pros."

With his background, Kempin was a good fit for the company's prospects of
improving its products.

"I can talk to our research and development staff as much as I can talk to [
racquet tester] Andre Agassi and our teaching pros. I'll go out and hit with
them. It's fun being a hands-on CEO."

'I just love the sport'

BYLINE: Rich Brown, The Joplin Globe, Mo.

LENGTH: 664 words


May 20--By Rich Brown

rbrown@joplinglobe.com

When it comes to tennis, Marianella Padron is amazing.

The Joplin woman, a Venezuelan transplant, developed amazing skills in the game
in just two short years. But, perhaps even more amazing is the level she has
achieved in collecting rackets over a much longer period.

"I just love the sport," said Padron, executive tennis director at Millennium
Tennis & Fitness Club. "It is something that I really cannot explain because
tennis is something that I really enjoy and love doing."

Although Padron came from her native land of Venezuela to the United States in
the eighth grade, she didn't start playing tennis until she was 16. After
graduating from high school, she returned to Venezuela to enter college and was
ranked among the top 10 women's players in her country.

"I don't have any family members who do any kind of sports, so I think this is
just natural," she said. "That is why I am in this business because I love the
sport."

While attending college in Venezuela, she lived with her parents and that is
when the idea of a racket collection occurred to her.

"My parents had a house where I had my own room so instead of a picture frame, I
said 'Oh, we can display an old racket over here," she said. "Suddenly, I got
another one ... and another one ... and, then, it got to be too many to display
on the wall, and when I got out on my own I had to find a special room where I
could store them properly."

Padron, who is 39, started that collection 15 years ago and has seen it grow to
over 2,000 rackets.

"I started with the rackets you could easily find, like at a thrift store and
Good Will, such as a Jack Kramer Wilson or a Pancho Gonzales Dunlop," she said.
"They were fairly popular at that time."

Padron, who graduated from Florida Atlantic University where she played No. 3 in
both singles and doubles, went to work at the National Tennis Center in Key
Biscayne after graduation.

"I worked with nationally ranked players and trained them," she said. "At the
time I had probably around 200 rackets. A lady gave me a tennis collectibles
book and that is when I started looking other places to acquire more rackets."

Not only did she start going to more stores but, also, began Internet searches
on EBay.

"That is when I started collecting early 1900s rackets," she said. "I collected
only wood rackets at the beginning. That is my specialty. And then after about
three years, I decided to get some metal rackets to expand the collection.

"So now I have around 2,000 wood rackets and over 200 metal ones. The oldest
racket I have is from 1890. It is a Slazenger and is called The Demon."

Padron said she has come across people who played tennis from the 1940s to 1960s
who have given her rackets.

"They said, 'Here, I am giving you these because I know you are going to
appreciate tennis, so I want you to have them,'" she said. "They knew that
whatever racket they gave me that it would stay with me."

Today her collection has even expanded beyond rackets.

"I have around 300 tennis books, the earliest dating back to 1915, vintage cans
of tennis balls, tennis presses from early years and racket canvas from the
early 1890s through 1980, as well as various other items," she said.

So where, you might ask, is this all leading?

"My goal is to have a tennis museum where I can display all my items," she said.
"I did a little research and found out there are only four tennis museums in the
world. One is the International Hall of Fame at Rhode Island and the others are
at the Australian Open site, the French Open in Paris and Wimbledon."

Racquet Club team falters in regionals

BYLINE: NANCY MORGAN

SECTION: NEIGHBORHOOD TIMES; TENNIS; Pg. 14

LENGTH: 327 words



The 4.5 men's team from Racquet Club of St. Petersburg wrapped up a  successful
season with its appearance in the Adult Tennis League regional  competition last
weekend in Sarasota.

The team faced Naples, Tampa, Fort Myers and Sarasota, finishing with a 1-3
record and losing its bid to advance to the U.S. Tennis Association state
championships next month in Orlando.

"We were proud to have gotten this far," said captain Jim Cohen. "Now  that
we're done, we'll have a little break. However, one thing about going  into
post-season play is that by the time you finish, it's only about six  months
before you start again."

The Racquet Club was a wild-card team in the local league playoffs and went  on
to defeat division champions Royal Racquet Club and Belleview Mido. .

In its first regional match, the Racquet Club lost to Naples 3-2. It evened  its
record at 1-1 by defeating Tampa 4-1 in a second match.

When Cohen and his teammates saw that Naples was 3-0 with a match  remaining,
they conceded that winning was impossible and decided to experiment  with the
lineup.

In the 3-2 loss to Naples, Jim Hartley Jr. won No. 2 singles and Brian  Smith
and Hernan Molina won No. 2 doubles.

Cohen in singles, and the doubles teams of John O'Brien and Brady Tushaus  (No.
3)  and Tim Brady and Steve Riley (No. 1) lost their matches.

The team's ninth player was Ken Heretick, who played doubles against Tampa  with
Tushaus.

OTHER ADULT TEAMS: Four of the 10 area teams advancing to regionals won  their
divisions. Advancing to next month's state tournament are McMullen's 4.5
women's team, and men's teams from Feather Sound Country Club (3.0), East Lake
Woodlands (3.5) and McMullen (4.0).

CAMP: Weekday camps are available through the week of Aug. 16 at the  Treasure
Island Golf, Tennis and Recreation Center. Players ages 8-12 are  invited for a
9 a.m. to 1 p.m. day of tennis. Call Frank Angelelli at  347-3084.

Racquet Club member finds relief at tournament

BYLINE: NANCY MORGAN

SECTION: NEIGHBORHOOD TIMES; Pg. 18

LENGTH: 864 words


No surprise, Hurricane Charley was on Joe Damouny's mind as the time neared for
him and his teammates on the Racquet Club of St. Petersburg's 3.5 squad to
travel to Daytona Beach for last weekend's USA Tennis Florida Adult League
Sectional Championships.

Also on the 24-year-old's mind was some concern with missing a day of work at a
fairly new job with a technical recruiting company in Tampa and helping at home
if the hurricane hit.

When work was canceled Friday, Damouny and his mom, Bette, left just before
midnight for the drive across the state. Arriving at 3:30 a.m. after a couple of
wrong turns, Damouny directed his focus toward the tournament.

"I guess once I started playing my match, I just didn't think about the
weather," Damouny said. "It was after we played that we learned our area was
going to be okay."

The Racquet Club had lost No. 1 and No. 2 doubles when Damouny pulled out a
third-set tiebreak victory in No. 1 singles to

give the club the first of three wins over Jacksonville.

Don Cobin followed with a third-set tiebreak victory in No. 2 singles, as did
Neel Voss and Ray Cianci in No. 3 doubles, and the Racquet Club won 3-2. The
tournament was postponed before play was complete because of the storm.

"The finish was pretty climactic with us being down 2-0 before winning the next
three," Damouny said. "It's good to win the first match and depending on how the
tournament is re-scheduled, we're at an advantage."

This is Damouny's first year on the Racquet Club team. He agreed to step in when
his dad, Tony, a regular on the squad, became ill.

Because of Damouny's youth and quickness, he was tabbed to defend one of the two
singles positions.

"I started playing tennis when I was about 5 because both my parents played,"
Damouny said. "My dad taught me, but when I was in the eighth grade, I decided
football and basketball were cooler sports. I played tennis in high school at
Shorecrest, but it wasn't a big deal then at the school like it is now."

Damouny was captain of Shorecrest's football team and plays some organized
football and basketball. Those sports, along with soccer, helped his tennis
game, he said.

Playing a power game from the baseline, Damouny relies on his forehand to set up
for another forehand, hoping to avoid a somewhat unreliable two-handed backhand.

"With my new job, I work some long hours and don't get to practice or play as
much as I would like," Damouny said. "My best strength right now is my youth.
What I need to develop is consistency."

Racquet Club captain Bob Steele has counted on Damouny's youth and quickness.

In regional competition last month in Naples, Damouny won all three of his
singles matches as well as a doubles match.

"Joe's a hard-hitter from the baseline who's played well for us," Steele said.
"For him and his mom to leave at midnight to drive to Daytona Beach shows the
commitment he has for the team. I actually had eight different possible lineups
in a 24-hour period because of not knowing who was and was not coming because of
Hurricane Charley."

Prior to the cancellation of the tournament, the McMullen 3.0 men beat Indian
Harbour 3-2, Seminole Lake Tennis Center lost its match with Gainesville 3-2 and
Clearwater 5.5 fell 3-0 to Lakeland. The Clearwater 5.0 women did not play
Friday.

The re-scheduled tourney is Sept. 10-12. By Friday, team captains and local
league coordinators will be notified, along with details placed on the
http://www.usatennisflorida.usta.com website.

NET SHOTS: Joel Samaha collected a gold ball for the boys 14-and-under doubles
title in the U.S. Tennis Association National Championships in San Antonio,

ATLANTA AT PLAY;
COVER STORY;
MAKING A RACQUET;
Titanium is the latest hot trend in tennis technology, but it's not for
everyone.

BYLINE: Todd Holcomb

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 10T

LENGTH: 1144 words


Head says its new titanium tennis racquets are the lightest, most powerful
frames ever made. Prince and Wilson, the makers of more than 75 percent of
racquets sold in the United States, would like to roll their eyes at that, but
consumers won't let them.

"The Head titanium is the fastest-selling introduction I've been associated with
in the 12 years I've been in the business," said Scott Jones, who provides
inventory for 15 pro shops in Atlanta.

Jones said the run on titanium in Atlanta is more frantic than the one he
witnessed for Wilson's wider racquets in 1987 and for Prince's longer racquets
in 1995. Whether titanium changes the way racquets are made as those earlier
innovations did remains open to question, but Head's first two titanium racquets
, the Ti.S7 and the Ti.S6, account for between a quarter and a third of racquets
sold in Jones' shops since they hit stores in January. "And that's pretty
strong," Jones said, "when you consider that's two frames compared to the 100 we
have on the wall."

So Wilson and Prince joined the titanium bandwagon last month, introducing their
own models in Atlanta at the Super Show. Those titanium racquets, plus Head's
new Ti.S5, are due in Atlanta this month.

Head, a distant third in racquet sales in the 1990s, predicts the Ti.S6 and the
Ti.S7 will be the industry's top two racquets in dollar sales this year. That
would be news. Even though Head is the racquet maker for Andre Agassi and almost
a third of the top 100 players on the ATP Tour, it hasn't had a top-five racquet
in the sales race in 15 years.

"We've had the reputation as the high-level tour player's racquet," said Carl
Helmetag, the president and CEO of Head. "What we didn't have in our line was a
racquet that appealed to the club player who was looking for a larger sweet
spot, a lighter racquet and a stiffer racquet. Titanium communicates the feature
that it's light and it's powerful."

There's no debating Head's titaniums are the lightest frames around. At 8 ounces
unstrung, they're about three-quarters the weight of most traditional racquets.
Head claims it's in the titanium, though titanium is actually three times
heavier than graphite. Head says the lighter racquet is a result of the way
titanium bonds with graphite, making for a stiffer racquet that requires less
material.

Industry leaders aren't so impressed.

"Head did a great job marketing it, but there's really no benefit of titanium,"
said local Wilson representative Klaus Dlabek. "It's a lighter racquet, but it's
not because of the titanium."

And why is lighter better, anyway? According to Head, it allows for greater
racquet head speed and maneuverability. Again, there are dissenters.

"If you have a truck traveling at 60 mph and a car traveling at 60 mph and they
collide, which one's going backward?" asked Dave Holland, Prince's director of
tennis. Holland says Head's racquets are too light. Thus Prince's new titanium
racquet, the ThunderStrike, is a bit heavier at 9.3 ounces.

Prince and Wilson remain more invested in the concept of widening the sweet spot
through more versatile string holes. This technology allows the strings nearer
the frame to cup the ball longer and control off-center shots. Prince calls the
idea Sweetspot Suspension System. At Wilson, it's Power Holes technology.

"Titanium is such a hot topic that we can't say, 'Oh, it's not appropriate.'
There are some benefits," said Heather Kinsella, Wilson's communications
manager. "But titanium is just a material. It's not a technology that's going to
change tennis like Power Holes or Hammer-weighted design."

Ultimately, the consumers will decide. THE TOP FIVE RACQUET MAKERS YONEX 1997
U.S. market share: 2 percent. Clients: Martina Hingis, Monica Seles. New models:
Super RQ-1000, $ 270 (it's humongous, 130-square inches, for "ladies and senior
players or anyone with slow swing speed"); Super RQ-700 Long, $ 220 (an
evolution of the RQ-500 that Seles uses but lighter and larger, 110 square
inches. Seles is making the switch); RD Power-10 Long, $ 195 (long- body
power-hitters racquet that Marcelo Rios used at the Australian Open). Yonex
plans a titanium racquet this next month. Technology: Isometric Square Head
Shape. Strings are of similar length, which makes for a longer sweet spot that's
higher in the head, where most people hit the ball. Note: Market shares based on
sales in specialty stores and pro shops. HEAD 1997 U.S. market share: 9 percent.
Clients: Andre Agassi, Gustavo Kuerten. New models: Ti.S7, $ 299 (the most
potent of the "lightest, most powerful racquets ever made"); Ti.S6, $ 249
(titanium in traditional head shape for more control); Ti.S5, $ 199 (Head's
newest titanium in the smallest head size, 107.5 square inches, due in stores
this month). Technology: Titanium. Head was the first to put it in a tennis
racquet. DUNLOP 1997 U.S. market share: 4 percent. Clients: Mark Philippoussis,
Wayne Ferreira. New models: Max Tech, $ 179 (a game-improvement racquet in
standard length with Vectran, which reduces vibration); Max Superlong 1.50, $
225, and 1.00, $ 200 (longer models in the new Max series); Revelation 200G, $
188 (Dunlop's newest racquet for advanced players); Revelation Tour Superlong, $
118 (longer version of the economical Revelation Tour). Technology: Vectran, a
material in the racquet throat that dampens vibration by 30 percent, lessening
the strain on the arm and shoulder. WILSON 1997 U.S. market share: 41 percent.
Clients: Pete Sampras, Steffi Graf. New models: Hammer eXtreme 3.2 Power Holes,
$ 219 (Wilson's plunge into titanium); Hammer 6.4 Power Holes, $ 179, and Hammer
6.4 Stretch Power Holes, $ 189 (enhancements of Wilson's popular "skunk" frame,
the Hammer 6.2, with Power Hole technology); Pro Staff 6.7 EB, $ 99, and Pro
Staff 5.7 Stretch EB, $ 109 (player's racquets with Even Balance design).
Technology: Power Holes. The grommets (those holes where strings meet frame) are
elongated on the inside of the racquet head, allowing the strings to move more
freely on impact. This "freedom of string" keeps the ball on the strings longer,
producing more power and directional control for off-center hits. PRINCE 1997
U.S. market share: 36 percent. Clients: Michael Chang, Jana Novotna. New models:
ThunderStrike, $ 280, and ThunderStrike LongBody, $ 325 (Prince's first titanium
frames and their largest, most powerful racquets); ThunderLite LongBody, $ 170
(a longer version of the No. 2 seller in the U.S. for 1997); Precision Equipe
LongBody, $ 205 (a longer version of Prince's top-seller for more advanced
players). Technology: Sweetspot Suspension System. See Wilson's Power Holes.
Prince innovated this technology last year and claims Wilson is just following
the leader. Sweetspot Suspension helped Prince capture three of the top five
spots in racquet sales last year.

EXCLUSIVE Federer pulls the strings in racket design World No 1 plays key role
in development of Wilson's new K-Factor, writes Mark Hodgkinson

LUDDITES will not be pleased to hear about Roger Federer the scientist. While
most tennis players take little more than a passing interest in racket
technology and development, leaving it to the manufacturers, Federer was
involved at every stage in the production of his new weapon, including testing
an extraordinary number of prototypes along the way, 87 in all.

So Federer's new racket is very much his baby. Never before has a tennis player
collaborated with a racket company like this. "A racket is very personal,''
Federer said of his Wilson K-Factor, which took some two years, and millions of
pounds, to create, starting at the 2005 Australian Open when he let it be known
he required greater control and feel off the strings without losing anything in
his shots. "I'm a bit crazy about what I have in my hand, because that has a lot
to do with how the points will be played.''

Federer was quite the science geek, according to Antoine Ballon, Wilson's global
head of marketing for performance rackets. "It's unheard of for a player to be
as closely involved as Roger was. Most players aren't that bothered, and they
just say to you, 'Do whatever you want, just don't change too much'.

"But Roger paid attention to every single detail, and wanted to be involved with
everything. It was that attention to detail, and him wanting to feel totally
comfortable with the racket, which showed me why he is world No 1. It was
incredible really,'' Ballon said.

Federer's family has a science background, as his parents met through both being
employees of a pharmaceutical company in Basle, and you can imagine the world No
1 in safety specs and exchanging his Wimbledon whites for laboratory whites. He
did not go that far. But he almost did.

"Roger is probably the only tennis player who would be prepared to work closely
with us like this,'' Ballon said.

"To be the best you have to look closely at the details,'' said Federer, who has
a title to defend at the Sony Ericsson Open, which is regularly referred to as
the most prestigious event after the four grand slams, and which starts here in
Miami, Florida, tomorrow.

"I've been working closely with Wilson, and they bring me the best technology so
I can perform as well as I can on the court. It's so interesting. Wilson always
come up with innovations. Control is an important part of my game. The racket
feels great. It's a great innovation. The game has changed.

"My strength is to be able to control my opponents, and control the points,
playing them as I want them to be played. I think I'm very good at playing both
defence and attack, and for that you need great control.''

The K-Factor racket, which Wilson regard as a substantial leap forward in racket
science, has only just been officially launched, although Federer used it at a
tournament for the first time at January's Australian Open when he eased to the
title without dropping a set all fortnight.

While some commentators lament the fact that racket technology has allowed
players to strike the ball with more power than ever before, and that the
average men's tennis match now contains more violence than a Quentin Tarantino
box-set, it was an increase in control that Federer demanded from his new
equipment. So it was significant that Federer committed a tiny number of
unforced errors at Melbourne Park.

It all began with the conversations Federer had with Wilson in Australia two
seasons ago. Towards the end of that 2005 season, Federer tried out some
prototypes for the first time. "But Roger wasn't quite happy with them at
first,'' Ballon said.

"He said that he was getting more control, but that he was also losing something
as well. But it was to be expected that he wasn't happy from the start. It was
fascinating for me to get such great feedback from a player.

"Most players don't say much, but what Roger said to me was very precise,
telling me what happened when he hit particular shots on different parts of the
racket. He was a great guy to deal with. Roger put a huge number of hours into
this.''

And it was not just the performance of the racket which concerned Federer, a man
who likes everything to be just so, as he also became the first tennis player to
personally oversee the design and colours used in the racket. That the K-Factor
is red and white is only because Federer gave his say-so - Federer, a tennis
player, a scientist and a designer. No wonder everyone else has such
difficulties trying to keep up with him.

"This was the first time we had worked with a tennis player on the colour
scheme,'' Ballon said. "We originally showed Roger 42 different drawings of
colour schemes, and then at Wimbledon last year, I met with him in his rented
house there and we looked at 15 prototype rackets with their colours.

"We spent three hours looking at the rackets that day, and eventually he chose
one in the autumn of last year after another meeting in Switzerland.''

Cosmetics concern Federer. "Players are very superstitious about their racket
and they need to feel comfortable with it, even down to how it looks,'' Ballon
said. "The prototypes he tested for performance were black. But then came the
cosmetic side. If he didn't like the design of the racket, if he didn't really
love the racket, then he wouldn't want to switch.''

But it is the performance of the racket which plainly matters most to Federer.
He is no mad scientist, the Swiss.

Royal Racquet wins third title in Area Doubles

BYLINE: NANCY MORGAN

SECTION: SEMINOLE TIMES; TENNIS; Pg. 4

LENGTH: 932 words



Royal Racquet Club has earned its third Pinellas Area Doubles League
championship, adding to titles won in 1989 and 1994.

Royal Racquet II edged Countryside I 76-75 out of 90 possible points in the
19-team league that plays five doubles positions per team.

Royal Racquet II was 18-0 overall, giving up just 14 individual matches.
Countryside I was 17-1, with its only loss to the Royal II team 3-2.

Last year, Countryside I won the PADL with a 20-0 record and outplayed  Royal II
by 12 points. In 1994, Royal II was first, again edging Countryside I  by a
point.

"It seems to depend on the day whether we or Royal win," said Kathy  Myers,
captain of Countryside I. "One thing is certain, it is never a wipeout  for
either team."

PADL, the youngest women's doubles league in Pinellas, has crowned six
different teams in its 10-year existence. Feather Sound Country Club
appropriately won in the first year in 1987 in that Rick Murray, Feather
Sound's tennis director, began the league. St. Petersburg Tennis Center won in
1988 and 1990, Countryside I triumphed in 1991 and 1995, Countryside II won in
1993, and East Lake Woodlands won in 1992.

This year's championship came down to Royal II's final match with an East  Lake
Woodlands team. A five-position sweep would clinch it; four wins would  result
in a 75-75 tie with Countryside I and a playoff between the two.

"We had four team wins before Barbara (Brutus) and I finished in No. 1,"  said
Valerie McFarland, Royal's captain. "We were in the third set and the  girls
told us what we needed to do and we won 7-5 in the third."

McFarland and Brutus were unbeaten in No. 1, as were Karen Koch and Sara  Wiand
in No. 5. Rounding out the team are Melonie Rhodes and Joan Christensen  in No.
2, Cari Reagin and Elisabeth Lufler in No. 3, and Linda Cope and Sue  Stiffler
in No. 4.

Countryside I's team included Hank Skoczen and Robin Meinrod in No. 1, Ann
Elias and Holly Loy No. 2, Diana Hoffman and Ann Beauchamp No. 3, Rose Kropke
and Kathy Myers No. 4, and Joyce Herman and Donna Boderick No. 5.

JUNIORS AT WORK: Nine girls and 14 boys from Pinellas competed in last  month's
state-sanctioned designated tournament in Tallahassee. Rain eliminated  final
matches.

Ashely Rimel, Marci Malanik, Christa Grey, Amanda Earhart and Janet Walker
competed in the girls 18 division. The second-seeded Walker reached the final;
the unseeded Grey the playoff for third and fourth places. Lori Grey, Gina
Craig, Amanda Eutzler and Sydnie Zillig were in the girls 16 division, with
third seed Grey reaching the round of 16 for the best finish.

Danny McCain, Kent Wright, Matt Brown, Jimmy Langton, Gerald Casas, John  Paul
Campbell and Matthew Stock participated in the boys 18. No. 16 McCain and  No. 7
Wright advanced to the quarterfinals. Kevin and Kinzie Wright, Joel  Berman,
Justin McNulty, Trent Cole, Kyle Nelson and Michael Murray played in  boys 16.
No. 6 Berman reached the final, and No. 16 Kinzie Wright the  third-fourth
playoff, losing to Berman 6-0, 6-0 in a semifinal.

The girls and boys 14-and-under designated tournament is April 27-29 in  Ponte
Vedra Beach.

Last weekend, No. 1 seed Marc Sawyer of Largo defeated No. 2 Maro Kim of
Casselberry 6-3, 6-0 to win the boys 12 title in the ATP Tour Junior Classic  in
Ponte Vedra Beach.

FUTURE CHAMPIONS: East Lake Woodlands Net Workers and Crescent Oaks were  tied
for first place in the Future Champions League before the spring break.  Seven
teams compete in the second-year league, including four teams from East  Lake,
two from Countryside and one from Crescent Oaks.

According to league organizer Bob Butterfield, tennis director at East Lake
Woodlands, the league was formed to provide an opportunity for team  competition
for players at the 2.5-3.5-minus NTRP levels.

TENNIS FOR LOVE: Countryside Country Club hosted its 12th Annual Love Fore
UPARC charity golf and tennis tournaments last month. The Upper Pinellas
Association for Retarded Citizens received a check for $ 31,725. In all, more
than $ 100,000 has been earned through the annual events.

Top players in the men's tennis competition were winner Tom Borzell, Bob
Anderson, Brad Wasserman, Guy Pearson and Mohsen Sofasti. Kathy Borzell won  the
women's title, followed by Libby Doub, Joyce Herman, Elaine Barrett and  Ellie
Proly.

Sofasti won the men's fastest-serve contest, as did Debbie Rothberg the
women's.

THIS WEEKEND: The Junior Grand Prix Challenger Series is Saturday and  Sunday at
the Golda Meir/Kent Jewish Center in Clearwater. The multiple match  play format
is geared to players with limited tournament competition or those  beginning
state-sanctioned events. For information, call 736-1494.

East Lake Woodlands hosts this weekend's final Virginia Slims Grassroots
Challenge for women's amateur doubles teams in the area. Teams in the 3.5, 4.0
and 4.5 NTRP levels will battle for the right to advance to a regional playoff

Inventor's hybrid sport a quick hit; Euro-Racket warmly received by athletic
clubs

BYLINE: By Scott Bernarde Staff writersports; recreation; trends

SECTION: EXTRA; SECTION J; PAGE 10

LENGTH: 472 words


Picture a game that's an unusual mix of tennis, racquetball, hockey and
paddleball, and you might come close to imagining what Euro-Racquet is all
about.

The brainchild of Fayetteville resident John Poulakis, Euro-Racquet -  which
despite its name has nothing to do with anything European - is about as unusual
a game as can be found anywhere. Played on a 40-foot long court - indoor or
outdoor - the game is kind of like dodge ball played with wooden paddles.

"I play any kind of racquet sport - tennis, pingpong and racquetball - but I
always felt like I wanted someone across from me to challenge," Poulakis said.
"I slowly thought about it and then developed it."

Poulakis, who moved to Atlanta from his native country of Greece 23 years ago
("I'm more American than Greek," he says), began working on Euro-Racquet nine
years ago. After several changes and refinements, the sport has gotten a warm
reception at about 20 metro Atlanta athletic clubs.

He started demonstrating the game a month ago and has been asked to return for
more demonstrations at several clubs. The game so impressed the people at the
Falcons Sports and Fitness Complex that the Suwanee club has taken the lead by
opening the first Euro-Racquet court in the area.

"I look for it to take off - leagues, tournaments, things like that," said Carl
Spear, director of marketing and programming at the club. "It's a good
alternative to all the other racket games.

"It has the three things I look for in a sport: education, competition and
recreation. It's easy to learn, you can be very competitive, and it's a lot of
fun. And it gets the heart going."

The game is one of many new programs Spear is trying to implement at his club.
It's been difficult to find much open time on the court, which has taken over
one of the club's racquetball courts.

"It's like a guided missile attack," said David Lockridge, a state- ranked
racquetball player. "It's really a fast sport. You can score points even if you
don't make a good shot. That's something you can't do in racquetball."

Euro-Racquet can be played in singles, doubles or even two-on-one. The court
changes from 16 feet wide for doubles play to 8 feet wide for singles. Players
face each other and stand in front of an 8-foot high net, or goal.

The object is to score points by hitting the ball into the opponent's goal.
Goals can be scored on the bounce or fly. The players use a racket similar in
size to a racquetball racket, but heavier. The ball is a tennis ball used for
peewee players.

The game is harder than it looks. With the proximity of the players and the
reaction time required using the heavy paddle, it becomes difficult to hit the
ball accurately.

"You have to be accurate, and you definitely have to have a lot of skill,"
Poulakis said.

Judge Breaks Up the Spaghetti Racket

BYLINE: By Byron Rosen, Washington Post Staff Writer

SECTION: Sports; FanFare; F2

LENGTH: 464 words


What it is isn't tennis, the federal judge decided in Omaha after disgesting
studies of what happens when players use the double-strung implement popularity
called the spaghetti racket.

So, Judge Albert G. Schatz yesterday upheld the right of the United States
Tennis Association to outlaw the thing, it has since the International Tennis
Federation barred it three years ago.

Gunter Harz Sports Inc. of Omaha, maker and marketer, sought removal of the ban
and asked $2 million damages from USTA.  Cliff Drysdale of the Association of
Tennis Professionals testified the double layer of strings enabled a player who
never could impart topspin with a conventional racket to hit great topspin lobs
with just a small adjustment in stroke.  Vic Braden, noted teaching pro, showed
that on a typical 120-foot court with 12-foot fence, such a lob hit hard enough
with a spaghetti racket could force an opponent to a 9-foot height against the
back fence to return it.

Judge Schatz: "A rule on racket specifications designed to prohibit rackets
which in part exaggerate a topspin . . . is rationally related to the goal of
preserving the character of the game of tennis." Suit dismissed. . .

Now Bob McAdoo wants to play, and grieves to the NBA Players Association because
the Detroit Pistons won't let him.  The former pro scoring champ out of North
Carolina claims he has been able since Feb. 14.  Says G.M. Jack McCloskey: "He
hasn't worked out one day since Jan. 21. . .Bob McAdoo playing the last 15 games
would do nothing for the Pistons."

Look at ex-Terp, ex-CBA Brad Davis finally making it in the NBA.  The 6-3 guard
with the good knack for assists suddenly a regular double-figure scorer for Dick
Motta at Dallas; topped a 22-point game last week with 31 against Boston
Tuesday. . .Another key NHL injury: Bob Dailey lost to the Flyers; knee torn up.
. .

New nomination for worst-behaved basketball fans: Wyoming's were witnessed" when
Brigham Young visited Laramie last week, says BYU President Jeffrey R. Holland.
Cougar players, coaches, fans allegedly pelted with rotten fruit and rocks,
among other goodies. . .Fined $750 each: Ilie Nastase and Jim Delaney, who
developed his tennis around Montgomery County, for a shoving match in Denver
just shy of fisticuffs.  Goading Nasty won, 6-3, 7-5.

NBA Commissioner Larry O'Brien issues a directive against ejected coaches
relaying information to the bench.  This wouldn't have anything to do with
Sunday when ejected Boston Coach Bill Fitch might have cribbed the CBS telecast
showing Philly's Billy Cunningham diagramming strategy?

Virginia hires two football assistants for Dick Bestwick: Colgate aide Kurt Van
Valkenburgh, and Jim Cavanaugh, offensive coordinator at Marshall -- under Sonny

same calendar year since Margaret Court in 1970, adding an Olympic gold medal to
the achievement. She was on course for another clean sweep until beaten in the
final of the French Open by Arantxa Sanchez. We shall soon know whether that was
just an off day.

Howard Brody;
Nuclear physicist who became an expert on the science of tennis and the benefits
of big rackets

BYLINE: Howard Brody

SECTION: FEATURES; Pg. 76,77

LENGTH: 710 words


During a family holiday in Florida in the 1970s, Howard Brody, a nuclear
physicist, made a discovery. It was nothing to do with the Big Bang - but
everything to do with tennis. Brody's curiosity was piqued when he noticed
someone playing with an oversized racket. He asked a coach what the benefits
were but the man did not know, so Brody decided to investigate.

His hobby soon became his life's work, as Brody became a leading expert on the
science of tennis, producing two books and numerous scholarly articles on the
subject. He held several positions on governing bodies, including membership of
the technical committee of the US Tennis Association. He often attended meetings
in tennis shoes. After his holiday, Brody corresponded with Howard Head, the
American engineer whose Prince company patented oversized rackets, and he later
become a consultant for them.

With tennis booming in the Seventies and technology becoming increas-ingly
important as players sought to hit the ball with ever more power, Brody had
found his niche. If projects such as analysing whether rubber vibration
dampeners are really worth the money lacked the seriousness of his previous work
on elementary particles, they brought him far more attention. "I discovered
things about 'sweet spots'. It was great fun and that was one of the reasons I
decided to give up particle physics and go into tennis racket physics. People
were so much more interested in it," he said. In a 1988 interview, he said that
his work required him to spend more time in a laboratory, using lasers, mirrors
and oscilloscopes to investigate what happens when ball meets racket, than on
court.

He determined that Head's oversized racket was superior since its "sweet spot"
was in the centre of the racket head rather than in the throat and because "it's
wider, which means its moment of inertia is greater. The moment of inertia is
that quantity which resists twisting. The racket therefore is more stable. If
you hit a ball off-axis it won't twist the racket as much and you don't lose as
much power." In fact, he found that there are three sweet spots on a tennis
racket, varying in location from racket to racket.

Another important discovery was that looser strings created a slightly higher
ball velocity by storing and giving back more energy, which went counter to
previous thinking and to the racketstringing habits of some of the hard-hitting
stars. However, stiffer frames, which vibrated less, were better than flexible
ones. As for reducing the risk of tennis elbow, "you should make every effort to
hit the ball close to the nodal point of the minimum vibration, which is near
the centre of the head of the racket."

Born in New Jersey in 1932, Howard Brody was a keen amateur player and was on
the varsity team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, though he was
modest about his ability. "I played on the high school tennis team for one year,
and the coach gave up," he once said. He described his brief time as interim
coach of the University of Pennsylvania men's team as the highlight of his
career. He made regular trips to Wimbledon and once had a chance encounter with
Arthur Ashe while travelling by air. "I've always wanted to meet you," he told
the former world No 1. "Dr Brody, I've always wanted to meet you," came the
reply.

He was an emeritus professor of physics at the University of Pennsylvania, where
he taught from 1959 until his retirement in 2000. He could see the tennis courts
from his office. He is survived by two daughters, Victoria Stevenson, a
financial analyst, and Deirdre Bernstein, a homemaker. His wife, Lois Chase
Brody, died in 2011.

Among the fruits of his research, he advised players to use a stiff racket for
power and control and a lightweight one if their style was based on
serve-and-volley. He found that the winning player is usually the one who has
made the fewest unforced errors and that oversized rackets were more likely to

EDITORIAL: It's the Racquet Club's time for funding

BYLINE: Park Record, Park City, Utah

SECTION: COMMENTARY

LENGTH: 441 words


Apr. 17--Good thing the renovation of the Racquet Club, a long-overdue project
that City Hall is readying to start, did not depend on a decision by a Summit
County panel that gets to suggest how the County Courthouse divvies up funds
raised by a tax meant for recreation, arts and parks projects.

The panel, known as the Summit County Recreation, Arts and Parks Tax Recreation
Advisory Committee, this week made a questionable decision by not recommending
City Hall receive the full amount of the grant that it requested for the Racquet
Club work.

City Hall is deserving of the $350,000 that it had requested, even though that
would mean all the other applications would need to split the remaining $130,000
that is available this year. The panel recommended City Hall receive $100,000,
less than a third of what was requested.

The Racquet Club renovation, indeed, will be one of the largest publicly
financed recreation projects ever undertaken in Summit County. With a price tag
of nearly $10.5 million, Park City leaders have acknowledged the importance of
the facility, and health and fitness, to the community. The Park City Council
during the impending budget talks will determine whether the renovation
proceeds.

Groundbreaking could come as early as midsummer. If it does, the $250,000 that
the Summit County panel wants rejected would have been a nice contribution to a
facility that many people outside the Park City limits enjoy. Anyone who lives
within the Park City School District boundaries,

not just people who live within the Park City limits, is allowed to use the
Racquet Club for a reduced rate designed for residents.

We understand that there is a limited amount of money available, and the Racquet
Club is recommended to receive the largest of the grants, but weighing the
renovation against some of the others recommended for funding leaves us a little
disappointed.

When the Summit County Council considers the recommendations next week, we hope
the elected officials overrule the panel and fully fund the Racquet Club
request. The other, smaller projects are appreciated for what they will bring to
their communities, but the Racquet Club renovation should take precedence this
year as it benefits many more people.

AREA TENNIS; Local teams in Pinehurst in search of state titles

BYLINE: Anna Martin

SECTION: Sports; Pg. 6C

LENGTH: 546 words


Nine Wilmington USA League tennis teams will be in Pinehurst today through
Sunday to compete in the North Carolina USA League State Championship.

The teams representing Wilmington are local winners on each level. The remaining
levels competed in the first half of the state championship June 7-10 in
Wilmington.

Teams competing in Pinehurst, captains' names and club affiliation if applicable
are as follows: women's 3.0, Ann Downing, Echo Farms Country Club; women's 3.5,
Lori Mayes, Holly Tree Racquet Club; women's 4.0, Vonda Nelson; women's 4.5,
Vickie Grzeck; men's 3.0, John Perritt, Cape Fear Country Club; men's 3.5, Mark
Gilligan, Holly Tree Racquet Club; men's 4.0, Mike Kaizar, Echo Farms Country
Club; men's 4.5, Glen Watford, Holly Tree Racquet Club.

Also, the men's 3.0 team from Holly Tree Racquet Club received a wild card to
the state tournament. The team is captained by Al Lerch.

This should be the year for some state winners from Wilmington. All of our local
levels were very competitive.

The 3.0 and 3.5 women's divisions had a playoff in May to determine the winner
of each flight, something that gave our winners great preparation for the state
tournament.

The format for state championship play is a little different than our local
format, however. In the event that players split sets, a 10-point tiebreak is
played in lieu of a third set.  No break or coaching is allowed between the
second set and the tiebreak.

Winners on the state level will advance to Louisville, Ky., at the end of July
to compete against other winners from the Southern Section, which includes North
Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Kentucky, Arkansas, Alabama,
Louisiana and Mississippi.

A day-to-day update of the Wilmington teams' results at the state championship
can be found on the Greater Wilmington Tennis Association's web site at

Good luck to all the |Wilmington teams!

STRING; Tension, type will affect controlof your gametennis; sports

SECTION: EXTRA; SECTION G; PAGE 07

LENGTH: 271 words


What should the consumer be more concerned with - the type of tennis racket used
or the type of tennis string that is in it?

Manufacturers will agree that the type of tennis string you use will add to or
take away from the performance of the racket, and they often print stringing
tension recommendations on the frame itself.

There are many myths associated with stringing your racket and the effect it has
on the racket frame.

Rackets with lower stringing tensions will generate more power. Higher string
tensions will generate more ball control for experienced players.

Racket frames come in all different sizes and shapes and therefore have
different stringing patterns. A frame that has fewer strings or a lower string
density will generate more power. Frames that have longer string lengths in
their stringing pattern will generate more power. Smaller diameters generate
more power. Higher string gauge numbers translate into smaller diameters of the
string.

Spin can be directly related to the type of tennis string you use. A thinner
string will tend to produce more spin. A less dense string pattern will produce
more spin. Vibration is yet another area that influences tennis string. A softer
string, or one that has a softer coating, will tend to vibrate less. A string
that is more resilient will vibrate for a longer period of time.

String technology has become a science, as manufacturers continue to try to
reproduce the feel of natural gut strings. The marketplace is overflowing with
new tennis strings. Make sure you are an educated consumer when shopping for the
right string.

EQUIPMENT: WEIGHT DEBATE;
 Though physics experts say lighter rackets are less powerful and have smaller
sweet spots, consumers tend to disagree.;
 Atlanta at Play: Special Tennis Issue

BYLINE: Todd Holcomb, Staff

SOURCE: AJC

SECTION: Atlanta at Play; Pg. 8T

LENGTH: 856 words

The smart buyer of a new tennis racket must take sides these days.

In one corner, there are the physicists and old-school players who contend that
lighter rackets generate less power, have a smaller sweet spot and transmit more
trauma to the elbow and shoulder than heavier rackets.

Then there are the consumers and play-testers. The 10 best-selling rackets in
America this year are all lighter than the 11-ounce average for frames
introduced two years ago. Racket reviewers seem to share the consumers' delight.

"Lightweight rackets have shelf appeal," said Dale Queen, owner of Your Serve
tennis stores in Marietta, Norcross and Stone Mountain. "When someone picks it
up, it feels good, it's easier to maneuver, and so they'll try it out."

Queen estimated that 80 percent of his racket sales this year have been those
with lightweight frames.

The flight to light in the racket industry began in October of 1997, when Head
borrowed the name recognition of titanium from golf and introduced the lightest
rackets ever made, the Ti.S6 (8.5 ounces) and the Ti.S7 (8.6). Within two months
of broad distribution, the rackets were 1-2 in sales at specialty stores
nationwide.

Wilson and Prince followed with titanium rackets of their own. Now, rackets made
with the titanium alloy account for more than a third of all sold.

"At the time, all the competitors pooh-poohed the idea of lighter rackets, but
then everybody jumped on the titanium bandwagon," said Kevin Kempin, vice
president of international accounts for Head/Penn Racquet Sports.

Wilson's latest counter has been to concede to Head the title as first with
titanium and to trumpet another space-age material, a high-pressure carbon used
in the space shuttle. Wilson calls it Hyper Carbon and brags that it is 65
percent lighter and four times stronger than titanium.

"Titanium is isotropic, meaning it's strong in many different directions when
it's actually striking the material, like in golf clubs or balls," said Jeff
Karp, director of marketing for Wilson Racquet Sports. "For tennis rackets,
you're striking the strings, not the frame, so titanium is not the most ideal
application in rackets."

Wilson's first Hyper Carbon racket, the Hyper Sledgehammer 2.0 for mid- and
low-level players, came out in November and is now No. 1 this year in sales at
specialty shops. The No. 2 seller is the Hyper Hammer 5.3 stretch, out since
February. Lindsay Davenport is playing with one, albeit a weighted-down model.

So now Kempin is doing some pooh-poohing of his own. "Hyper Carbon is a material
that's been around for a long time in rackets," he said. "We've used it; Prince
has used it. Wilson has done a great job of repackaging lightweight graphite."

Those who play-test rackets have given high marks to Wilson's Hyper Carbon
entries, just as they have done for Head's titaniums. Tennis magazine awarded
the Wilson 5.3 straight A's in power, control, comfort and stability in both the
mid- and over-size head. The only other racket given similar high marks this
year was Head's Ti.Radical, the one Andre Agassi now uses. It's for more
advanced players, 4.5 and above.

While Wilson and Head quibble over material, they do agree about the benefits of
lighter rackets, the idea that lighter means greater head speed for power and
maneuverability for control. That's a controversial subject in itself.

"A lightweight racket is a dumb idea," said Wilmot "Mac" McCutchen, a lawyer and
inventor in California who has studied the physics of tennis for the past two
years and published results and his own racket rankings on an Internet site at
www.racquetresearch.com. "Pick-up appeal is the predominant criterion, after
cosmetics, for the ignorant. An epidemic of elbow and other arm injuries has
been the result."

McCutchen's beliefs are based on physics. A lighter racket allows for a faster
stroke, but faster strokes are harder to control, and lighter rackets slow down
more on impact, causing loss of power and higher risk of injury. McCutchen notes
that Pete Sampras' Wilson Pro Staff 6.0 is weighted to 14 ounces, about the same
as the wood rackets of the '60s and '70s.

"I have zero compliments for a light racket," said Dan Cassidy, a former top-100
touring pro who teaches at Atlanta's International Tennis Academy. " It's quick,
but there's nothing behind it. You can hit a heavy, spinning ball better with
heavier racket. When you get to really, really light it's useless, unless you're
an old woman."

Naturally, the racket makers disagree.

"It's not the weight of the racket, but where you put the weight," said Wilson's
Karp. "You have to maintain the mass in the head, or the ball will push around
the racket. With Hammer technology, it's like a hammer banging a nail to
optimize the power and stability."

Said Kempin, agreeing with Karp for a change: "If you can move the racket
through the air like Andre Agassi, then yes, you'll get more power with a
heavier racket. But that's not something a recreational player can do."

"The ultimate test," said Queen of Your Serve, "is to try the racket for
yourself and then decide."

FAST FACTS
The average price for a tennis racket bought in the United States from January
to June of this year at specialty stores was $ 153.88, according to Sports
Research Inc.
A high string tension is associated with more control, a lower string tension
with more power.
Pros vary widely in the tension of the strings in their racket. Greg Rusedski,
owner of the fastest recorded serve in ATP Tour history, strings his Wilson Pro
Staff 6.1 at 48 pounds. Monica Seles strings her Yonex Super RQ-1000 Long at 90
pounds.

 QUICK TIP
"A helpful rule of thumb is a player should restring their racket as many times
in a year as they play in a week," said Jill Workman, executive director of the
U.S. Racquet Stringers Association. "So if you play three times a week, each
racket should be strung at least three times a year."

TENNIS Need volleying expertise? Takes a hint from the wall

BYLINE: By Bill Johnson STAFF WRITERtennis

SECTION: EXTRA; Section J; Page 6

LENGTH: 439 words


Let's take a lesson from one of our favorite practice partners - the wall. Most
people at one time or another hit against a wall, and quickly learn that it
never misses and returns the ball at what seems to be a faster pace.

What kind of shot is the wall hitting? It's a volley. So if we hit our volleys
just like a wall hits its volleys, we should be great volleyers. Let's examine
how the wall executes its shot, so to speak, and see how we can copy it to get
the same results.

The wall's secret is that at the time of contact the face of the wall is
completely flat and does not swing, thus meeting the ball squarely. This means
that the maximum return speed is maintained.

If the face of the wall were tilted, it would hit the ball a glancing blow, thus
taking speed off the return. What we as volleyers should do is try to emulate
the wall's action by making sure our racket face is square upon impact.

The best way to accomplish this is to extend your racket arm forward and square
the racket to the oncoming ball. Keep the face square before, during and after
the ball makes contact. You have now executed the volley the same way as the
wall and you should have a solid hit.

What causes most volley errors is we try to help the ball. This causes us to
move the racket and thus have a slanted racket face upon contact. We then either
hit a weak shot or miss it altogether.

The next question usually asked is: "How do I get power on balls that are coming
slowly?" Watch Boris Becker, Stefan Edberg or John McEnroe and you will find
your answer - with your feet. You probably have heard television commentators
say after one of the pros hits a great volley, "Look how well he closed on that
volley."

Closing in on the volley means moving your feet toward the net while hitting the
shot. You should keep the racket face square to the ball and move through the
shot with your feet, thus getting the power of your body into the shot.

Most people try to get the power from moving the racket head, causing the racket
not to be square at contact and causing an errant shot. A second advantage
gained from closing is you eliminate low volleys. By getting close to the net
before hitting the shot, the ball has to be at least three feet high or it won't
be over the net. Keep your racket head square to the ball at contact and close
on all volleys, and you will volley like the pros. And if you perfect this, you
may even volley as well as the wall.

Andre Agassi nearly lost a grip on two special rackets at a benefit auction
before his wife, Steffi Graf, bought them for $360,000US.

In the live auction before Agassi's 11th Grand Slam for Children on Saturday at
the MGM Grand Garden Arena, the tennis star was almost ready to donate the
racket with which he won his first professional match, and the racket he used in
his final U.S. Open.

Bidding topped $320,000 before Graf intervened.

"Those rackets are supposed to stay with us," she said after placing the top
bid.

Agassi offered the next highest bidder a free tennis lesson.

In all, $8.6 million was raised at the benefit. Agassi called it "an amazing
night in an amazing year."

through Evergreen Racquet Club.

The facility's indoor courts have provided shelter since 1972, which means
tennis players should send a little thanks Ben Snyder's way.

Snyder was among the club's 25 original stockholders and has served as its
president since it opened. He is currently the majority stockholder.

The tennis community will honor Snyder in a 5:30 p.m. ceremony Friday prior to
the Metro Tournament mixed doubles semifinals and finals at Bloomington High
School's courts. The tournament begins at 6 p.m. today.

"I will accept this on behalf of Evergreen Racquet Club," said the modest
Snyder. "The other honorees (Benoni Green and the late Avis Hilfinger were
honored last year) have been great tennis players. I'm not a great tennis
player, but I love tennis and have been involved in the racquet club since it
was conceived."

Snyder is quick to credit others for helping create Evergreen Racquet Club.

"Tim Ives was the real mover and shaker who conceived the idea," Snyder said.
"Ted Allsup was a CPA and he was the financial guru that kept us sound of
finance."

Ives, Allsup and Hilfinger have recently passed away, making the past year a
somber one for the 73-year-old Snyder, who lives in Bloomington.

"Avis was the matriarch of tennis," he said.

Evergreen Racquet Club was built by Felmley Dickerson Co. for approximately $1
million using the same design as a club in Bettendorf, Iowa. It originally had
six indoor courts and a squash court.

It was later expanded to eight indoor courts and has one racquetball court. The
squash court was removed to make room for a fitness center and nursery.

"We still have our original pro at the racquet club, Jim Whitman," Snyder said.
"I don't know if there's another club around that has had the same pro for 32
years."

When the club was founded, tennis ranked as the third most popular sport,
according to Snyder.

"Today it's the 23rd most popular," he said. "It hasn't thrived. Things have
changed, but fortunately our membership is still strong and thriving."

Green called Snyder "a big cog in the wheel" of Twin City tennis.

"He has always been a big supporter of the Bloomington-Normal Tennis
Association," Green said. "Through the racquet club, he's been the leading
factor of the development of the youth programs for boys and girls."

Snyder first played tennis "a little" while at Bloomington High School, but he
didn't get serious about it until age 35.

"I love the exercise, but the main thing is the friendships that you make," said
Snyder, who had to give up tennis while recovering from hip replacement surgery.

"It was the friendships and the camaraderie that I missed more than the tennis."

Now back in the swing of things, Snyder downplays his tennis ability, but he was
good enough to win the age 45 singles title of the Metro Tournament in 1985 and
teamed with Ray Davidson to win the 55 doubles crown in 1992.

Over the years he has also won tournament doubles titles in several states with
partners such as Green, Wilson Burge and Evan Strawn.

"I've had some great partners," Snyder said.

A frequent practice partner, Bob Fairbairn, said, "I doubt he will ever be a
threat to make the Davis Cup, but he's a good tennis player and a good
competitor. I prefer to play on his side than to be against him."

Snyder takes more pride in the success local high school and college players
have had thanks to the racquet club.

BHS has won 21 sectional boys titles and 18 girls crowns. The BHS boys placed in
the state's top three seven times, winning state titles in 1989 and 1992.

"It's been very rewarding to see the accomplishments, not only in tennis, but in
other ventures, of people who have gone through that tennis program," Snyder
said.

As for his own tennis, Snyder has no plans to retire.

"I hope as long as I'm on this earth," he said, "I'm still playing."

FATHER, SON OPEN STORE AND SWAP KNOWLEDGE

BYLINE: Lacey Burnette/ Of The Post-Dispatch

SECTION: ST. CHARLES COUNTY POST; Pg. 3

LENGTH: 528 words


* Bill Steevens has been restringing tennis racquets since he was young. His son
Adam is the hockey expert. Together they have opened a store in Wentzville.

While studying at a seminary, Bill Steevens was impressed by something he
learned about a Jewish tradition.

"One thing I learned, that in ancient times, it was the responsibility of the
Jewish father to teach his son a trade," Steevens recalled. "I thought about
that and thought about what I could teach my son."

Growing up in Southern Illinois, Steevens had learned to string tennis racquets
from a pharmacist who was also an outstanding amateur tennis player. The
pharmacist, Cecil Powless, would restring racquets in his business in Flora,
Ill.

"He would pay me a few dollars for every racquet I did," Stevens said. "I've
done it off and on over the last 30 years. From 1977 to 1984, it helped me and
my wife, Amy, through college in Normal, Ill. Stringing racquets helped pay for
my first child. I haven't done it much since then, just privately."

Spurred on by his studies, Steevens decided to move ahead with a longtime dream,
opening a shop where he could string racquets. A few weeks ago, Steevens and his
son, Adam, 16, opened Tennis & Hockey Specialists in Wentzville. Adam is the
hockey specialist.

"On this side of the river, as far as I know, there really isn't any sort of
tennis shop, although there might be some home-stringers," Steevens said.

"In St. Louis County, there are three really good tennis shops. I'm hoping I can
provide as a good customer service as they do."

The shop sells Wilson, Prince and Dunlop racquets, string, shoes and
accessories, as well as string and accessories from Babolat and Gamma. In
addition to restringing, Steevens does regripping on racquets.

Steevens, 48, still plays tennis, a game he was taught by a circuit judge in his
hometown of Salem, Ill."

The 350-square-foot shop at 706 East Pearce Boulevard carries more tennis than
hockey items. But Steevens expects that to change. Adam is in charge of the
hockey operations.

Adam Steevens started playing roller hockey about 7 1/2 years ago in Warrenton
and then in Wright City. He then switched to ice hockey and played for a
Wentzville C team, the St. Louis Rockets, and now plays with a Kirkwood AA team.

The shop sells Easton hockey equipment, including sticks, shafts, blades, pads,
chest protectors and skates. It's unclear whether Bill will end up knowing as
much about hockey as he expects Adam to learn about tennis in this father-son
business. But there are other opportunities; Adam has a brother, Andrew, and
four younger sisters.

Steevens, a computer programmer, said business got off to a slow start, but he's
confident that customer service will build a clientele in a market he says is
thin on competition.

And in any event, to his son, he will have passed on something about not only
stringing tennis racquets, but about starting a business as well.

stop by and watch the tournament action. Admission is $5 for the entire
tournament or $3 daily.

There will be great close up views through the spacious lounge windows. The
Racket Club is truly excited about the opportunity to host this tournament for
the fourth straight year. "Not only does this event provide the club's members
and the public a rare and special opportunity to observe great
professional-quality tennis players on court, it also allows spectators the
chance to interact closely with players when they are not competing," said Rob
Laue, club manager at The Racket Club.

This tournament is a fundraiser for the Walt Herrick, Sr. Memorial Fund. Walt
Herrick Sr. was a Crystal Lake businessman who founded The Racket Club in 1972.
The fund was created to provide scholarships to promising junior players who
would otherwise not be able to afford access to tennis lessons and memberships
at The Racket Club.

A guaranteed $4,000 prize money distribution has made this tournament one that
professionals and top local collegiate players do not want to miss.

Innisbrook men win 3.5 opener

BYLINE: NANCY MORGAN

SECTION: PASCO TIMES; TENNIS; Pg. 4

LENGTH: 563 words



Innisbrook's 3.5 men's team responded to cheers and crowd support with a 3-2
victory over the Racquet Club of St. Petersburg last week.

"We had quite a rooting section," said Joe Gari, captain of the 12-player  team.
"We have the home-court advantage in all the playoff matches, which is  a real
benefit for us."

Innisbrook faced the Racquet Club in the first match of a best-two-of-three
playoff in U.S. Tennis Association Adult League Tennis. Playoff winners  advance
to regional competition next month with hopes of qualifying for state  and
national tournaments.

Against the Racquet Club, Gari and partner Ed McGinley were first off the  court
with a 6-4, 6-3 win in No. 3 doubles. Jim Smith in No. 1 singles and  Reinhard
Lauterbach in No. 2 followed with straight-set wins for the team  victory. Bob
McKenzie and Jerry McDowell in No. 1 and Conrad Berhorster and  Willie Coquelet
in No. 2 each lost hard-fought three-set matches.

"It's nice to get that first team win under your belt," added Gari. "And  having
the home-court advantage for all our playoff matches makes for an  interesting
situation."

This Saturday, Innisbrook plays East Lake Woodlands while the Racquet Club
meets the Vinoy. Last week, the Vinoy beat East Lake 3-2.

"East Lake is our division's wild-card team," said Gari. "We beat them  4-1
during the season. They know us and we know them. I'm sure there will be  some
maneuvering going on."

OTHER MEN'S PLAYOFFS: Innisbrook's 5.0 squad blanked Safety Harbor Spa 3-0  to
clinch the local division title and will compete at the next level this  summer.
David Kall is captain of the eight-player team that includes John  Miller, Tim
Wahl, Jim Dundee, Scott Spoerl, Ryan Shaashy, Richard Scott and  Rafael Muzquiz.

Last week, Countryside Country Club defeated the Racquet Club of St.  Petersburg
4-1 in a 4.0 playoff, and the St. Petersburg Tennis Center beat  East Lake
Woodlands. This week, Countryside hosts East Lake and the Racquet  Club plays at
the St. Petersburg Tennis Center.

The Racquet Club won its first match in the 4.5 playoff, 5-0 win over  Safety
Harbor Spa. McMullen beat Royal Racquet Club 3-2. Saturday, Royal hosts  Safety
Harbor while the Racquet Club hosts McMullen.

WOMEN'S PLAYOFFS: East Lake Woodlands edged the Racquet Club 3-2 and  Seminole
Lake beat the Vinoy by the same score in the 3.5 playoffs. Saturday,  the Vinoy
plays at the Racquet Club and Seminole hosts East Lake.

Paradise Island defeated East Lake 3-2 in the 4.0 playoff and hosts East  Lake
Saturday. A Paradise win would clinch the title; a loss would force a  third
match June 21.

SENIOR GAMES: Joan Malone of St. Petersburg won a silver medal in last  month's
Senior Sports Classic in Tucson, Ariz. Malone, 76, competed among 30  women in
the 75-79 age division and won four rounds before falling 6-2, 6-2 to  Charlotte
Decker of California in the final.

Only four other players from Florida medaled in tennis. In all, more than
10,000 athletes competed in a wide range of sports.

BACK TO TENNIS: A format of one-to-one guidance and assessment by a  physical
therapist and a tennis-teaching professional is June 22 at the Golda  Meir/Kent
Jewish Center in CLearwater. A small-group clinic with skill  supervision amd
problem solving will be available to all skill levels. Call  796-5559.

KINGS POINT WILL REOPEN FULLY WITHIN ONE MONTH;
 BUSINESSMEN WHO BOUGHT 50 PERCENT HAVE SET THE GOAL "GOOD FOR THE COMMUNITY"

BYLINE: Doug Moore Of The Post-Dispatch

SECTION: ST. CLAIR-MONROE POST; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 463 words

DATELINE: BELLEVILLE


Two Belleville businessmen have purchased 50 percent of Kings Point Racquet and
Fitness Club in their hometown and plan to have the club fully operational
within a month.

Steve Wolf and Michael Riley, who own nursing homes in Belleville, Alton,
Collinsville and Columbia, purchased the club Oct. 1 from St. Louis real estate
investor Robert Kaplan.

Belleville businessmen Jack Scoville and William Dahlmann retain ownership of
the other half of the $12 million fitness club. The purchase price by Wolf and
Riley was not disclosed. In November, the Belleville Investment Group, led by
Scoville and Kaplan, purchased the club from Union Planters Bank for $2.15
million.

Wolf's sister-in-law, Paula Stone, will re-open the daycare center she ran when
the club first opened in September 1995 and was owned by Belleville businessman
John Connors. It will be called StoneyBrooke Academy of Early Learning. She will
continue to operate The Treehut Preschool and Childcare Center in Belleville.

The doors of Kings Point were locked two years ago when Union Planters
foreclosed on $19 million in loans after Connors failed to make payments.
Connors, the brother of tennis star Jimmy Connors, was one of the founders of
the Alton Belle Casino. He pledged casino stock as collateral for the loans.
After John Connors stopped making loan payments, the bank sold the stock, which
was then selling for a depressed price.

Connors has a $300 million suit pending in Madison County Circuit Court against
Union Planters over the sale of the stock. Meanwhile, a federal judge last month
refused to release Connors from the debt to Union Planters, limited to $15
million through lending agreements.

When Connors and his wife, Lynn, filed for bankruptcy in 1999, they claimed they
that had kept virtually no records of their financial condition and did not have
the means to pay off their debt.

Wolf said his goal is to return Kings Point to a full-serve fitness and tennis
club.

"Both Mike and I are tennis players and used the club," Wolf said Friday. "This
is good for the community and a reasonable investment for us as well. Our intent
is to restore it and to exceed its membership levels."

Connors was hired in June as a tennis pro at the club when it opened for tennis
only, creating 170 memberships. Connors will stay on in that capacity, Wolf
said. The club's lounge opened Friday night. The fitness center will open Nov.
15 with the daycare center to follow by the end of the year. Wolf said owners
are looking for a tenant for the vacant upscale restaurant inside the club.

"We think it's a pretty prime property for someone and a pretty easy beginning
for someone," Wolf said. " It's a fully equipped place. The restaurant was built
for banquets."

Connecting with the community;
Police captain hands out tennis scholarships as part of ongoing youth program.

BYLINE: By PATRICK M. O'CONNELL; Tribune Staff Writer

SECTION: LOCAL; Pg. C3

LENGTH: 526 words


SOUTH BEND -- Kevin Kirkland is counting on the "cool design" of his shiny new
tennis racket to pay immediate dividends on the courts this summer.

"It sparks me to play better," said Kevin, 11, a fifth-grader at LaSalle
Intermediate Academy.

The snazzy racket may not automatically produce Andy Roddick-like serves or
perfectly placed drop shots, but the mental advantage the equipment provides may
translate into instant improvement for Kevin.

And why not? When Kevin received his very own tennis racket for the first time
-- freeing him from the burden of asking his older brothers if he could borrow
theirs -- the rush has been enough to put him on top of his own little tennis
world.

South Bend police Capt. Darryl Boykins recently handed the racket to Kevin as
part of his continuing effort to give kids who normally don't have the chance to
play tennis the opportunity to take part in the action.

Boykins targets kids who "can't afford tennis, don't have access to it, or the
kids who normally would play basketball or football," he said.

Thanks to Boykins' youth summer tennis program, Kevin and Derrick Smith, a
12-year-old who attends St. Matthew's School, each received a new racket and
$500 from the United States Tennis Association.

"I've never had a tennis racket before," Kevin said. "And I have my own money to
get the tennis stuff I need."

The two boys were selected for the scholarship by Boykins because of their
enthusiastic participation in the police captain's summer tennis program.
Boykins will again host the camp this summer at Washington High School on the
city's west side.

Without the program to keep him busy during the hot, muggy dog days of summer,
Kevin said he wouldn't be spending very much time outdoors.

"I'd probably be just playing video games or watching TV or hanging out with my
friends," Kirkland said.

This summer, in addition to participating in the eight-week camp, Kevin and
Derrick be required to use part of the USTA check to enroll in a competitive
tournament. The boys can use the rest of the money for other tennis-related
equipment, clothing and private lessons. Kevin plans to buy a new pair of shoes.

Both boys also will be registered for USTA membership, and if they continue to
participate in tournaments over the years, their results will be recorded by the
organization.

The tennis program also is an opportunity for the police to connect with the
community.

"So they see you as human beings, they see you as people," Boykins said. "They
can see that we're not always arresting people. ... As a police officer or a
police department, we can provide something beneficial to the community."

The USTA also wrote Boykins a check for $1,000, which the captain plans to use
to arrange a transportation van to help kids attend the sessions and, with
school approval, build a shed near the tennis courts that will provide shade
from the sweltering summer sun.

Boykins' words to the camp attendees simply state his goal: "I want you to get
something out of it that makes you a better person."

With Gotti Away, the Genoveses Succeed the Leaderless Gambinos

BYLINE: By SELWYN RAAB

SECTION: Section 1;    Page 1;    Column 1;    Metropolitan Desk

LENGTH: 1857 words


With John Gotti and scores of other organized-crime members behind bars, law
enforcement officials say that New York's mob families are undergoing a major
power realignment, elevating to the top rung of the Mafia a man who is best
known for walking around his neighborhood in his pajamas.

Federal and state officials say that since Mr. Gotti, the head of the Gambino
family, was convicted of murder and racketeering in 1992, the rival Genovese
organization has supplanted the Gambino family as the most powerful Mafia group
in New York and the nation.

The shift has placed significant power in the hands of Vincent Gigante, the boss
of the Genovese family and now the decisive voice on the Mafia's commission, the
group that sets mobster policies and resolves disputes.

Since Mr. Gotti, 54, began serving a life sentence without parole, the officials
say, he has been confined away from the general inmate population and his
communications outside of prison have been closely monitored. As a result, his
hold on the Gambino family has loosened and the crime organization has fallen
into disarray, lacking firm leadership. The family's ranks have been whittled in
the last five years to about 200 active members from 400, according to Federal
and state investigators who work on organized-crime cases.

The Genovese family, on the other hand, has 300 members and a hierarchy
relatively unscathed by prosecutions, making it the country's strongest Mafia
force, Federal and state law enforcement officials say.

Law enforcement officials emphasize that huge amounts of money are at stake in
the shift of power. Mr. Gigante's influence on the commission, the officials
say, often allows the Genovese family to harvest the largest shares of revenue
in mutual crime ventures with other families.  On Friday, a Federal grand jury
in Manhattan charged that the Genovese family took a secret bite out of the
Feast of San Gennaro, one of the city's most popular street festivals. In a
perjury indictment, the grand jury said that Genovese members picked vendors for
the feast in lower Manhattan and siphoned off significant amounts of the rents
paid for stalls.

Law enforcement officials say that the Genovese family has risen in the wake of
the Gambino family's decline, allowing Genovese mobsters to take over some
construction and gambling rackets previously dominated by the Gambino faction.

Federal and state officials estimate that New York's five Mafia organizations --
the Genovese, Gambino, Lucchese, Bonanno and Colombo families -- annually take
in billions of dollars in illicit profits. City Police Department officials
estimate that Mafia groups and people who work for them reap more than $2
billion a year alone in profits from illegal bookmaking and gambling enterprises
in the New York area. Salvatore Gravano, the former Gambino underboss, testified
that he routinely turned over more than $1 million a year in cash to Mr. Gotti
as his share of the family's plunder from extortion in the construction
industry.

Enigma Wrapped In a Bathrobe

The Genovese family has created
the largest bookmaking and loan-sharking rings in the New York area, the
officials say. The family's other major rackets include shakedowns from
construction companies for labor peace, control of the Fulton Fish Market and
extortion of companies doing business at the Ports of Newark and Elizabeth.

As the head of the Genovese family, the 67-year-old Mr. Gigante presents an
unorthodox image for a mob titan. Since the early 1980's, he has been seen
strolling sober-faced and bent near his home in Greenwich Village, clad in
pajamas and bathrobe and mumbling incoherently.

Federal prosecutors say that Mr. Gigante, by feigning mental illness, has
managed for five years to evade trial on charges of racketeering and plotting to
murder his rival, Mr. Gotti. "Gigante still remains a very powerful figure in
organized crime," said Lewis D. Schiliro, the head of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation's criminal division in New York. "We are confident he is the boss
of the Genovese family."

New Jersey authorities say the Genovese family has also emerged as the strongest
Mafia group in that state. Robert T. Buccino, deputy chief of investigations for
the state's Organized Crime Bureau, said that the Genovese family is suspected
of being involved in gambling and loan-sharking rings and of extorting kickbacks
for labor peace from construction, garbage-removal and trucking companies.

Overall, the authorities say that from informers and wiretaps they have noticed
significant shifts in the underworld, including these:

* All five families are reinforcing their ranks in an action they call opening
the books. In 1990 they stopped accepting new members because of fears that
newcomers could be more vulnerable to Government pressure to become turncoats.
Defections and prosecutions, however, have reduced their combined rolls to about
700 active mobsters from 1,000 in the late 1980's, and the godfathers believe it
is now safe to admit carefully screened recruits.

* After four years in prison, Mr. Gotti has lost control of the Gambino family.
Although he appointed his son, John Jr., 31, as acting boss, the younger Gotti's
rank is meaningless, and most Gambino captains are acting on their own
authority.

* The Bonanno family has revived and prospered since its boss, Joseph C.
Massino, was released three years ago from prison. The family is now almost as
strong as the Gambino family.

Along with the Lucchese and Colombo families, the Genovese, Gambino and Bonanno
organizations have operated in the region for 60 years and have created the
largest and most entrenched mobster stronghold in the country, F.B.I. officials
and prosecutors say.

And even though Government efforts over the last decade have helped weaken or
virtually eliminate most of the 20-odd Mafia families in the country, the
organizations in New York have proven more resilient, officials say.

A Loosening Grip, Federal Officials Say

Still, the officials say, they have achieved significant victories against the
mob in New York City and its suburbs, severely wounding the Gambino, Lucchese
and Colombo families through the convictions of their bosses and their top
lieutenants on racketeering charges.

Additionally, prosecutions and civil suits brought since 1990 by Federal
prosecutors and the Manhattan District Attorney's office have loosened the
Mafia's hold over major unions. The cases disclosed that the five families had a
hand in milking union pension and welfare funds and used threats of violence and
work stoppages to rig contracts and to extort millions of dollars from companies
in the construction, trucking, garbage-carting, garment and newspaper delivery
businesses.

Federal and state officials and investigators, however, grudgingly concede that
no major figure in the Genovese family has become a turncoat. "Clearly, we have
not had the same impact on them as the other families," said Eric Seidel, head
of the state's Organized Crime Task Force. "They have hardly been touched."

Mr. Seidel and other officials credit Mr. Gigante's organizational skills and
tight security for keeping his family intact.

Mr. Gigante, whose underworld nickname is Chin, relays his orders through a
handful of trusted intermediaries, officials said. Secrecy is so intense, they
said, that Genovese members are forbidden to mention Mr. Gigante by name and
refer to him only by touching or motioning to their chins.

"We've had some bad breaks with the Genovese family," Mr. Schiliro, the F.B.I.
official, acknowledged in an interview. "Chin represents a difficult individual
for us. We've had him in court a number of times without final success."

Mr. Gigante was indicted in 1990 on Federal charges of bid rigging and
extortion, and in 1993 he was accused in a superseding indictment of conspiracy
to murder eight organized-crime figures and of plotting to kill Mr. Gotti.

A hearing on his mental and physical ability to stand trial will be held on
Sept. 11. Barry Slotnick, Mr. Gigante's lawyer, did not respond to repeated
telephone calls for comment on the charges against Mr. Gigante.

As evidence of Mr. Gigante's power, law enforcement officials point to the
Gambino family's acceding to his ultimate authority on the Mafia commission even
though he is accused of ordering the murders of Gambino leaders. The Federal
indictment against Mr. Gigante asserts that he wanted Mr. Gotti and several of
his captains killed because they engineered the murder in 1985 of the previous
Gambino boss, Paul Castellano.

The Unmaking Of a Family Man

The decline of the Gambino family, authorities say, stemmed largely from Mr.
Gotti's conviction three years ago on Federal charges of murder and racketeering
and the life sentence that followed. Investigators say they believe that even
Mr. Gotti's most steadfast supporters in the family realize there is faint hope
that his conviction will be overturned.

Mr. Gotti is being held in virtual solitary confinement in the Federal
Penitentiary in Marion, Ill., and officials said that his network of receiving
information from New York and transmitting instructions has been shattered.

Visitors can talk to him only over a monitored telephone, and his mail is
inspected. "By not being in the general prison population," a Federal agent
said, "it is impossible for him to keep in touch, issue orders and have control
over anybody."

Mr. Gotti's son continues to collect the "tribute," a share of the family's
income that is reserved for the boss, officials said. But they noted that prison
sentences have reduced the number of active family crews to 10 from 22 and
sharply cut the Gambino family's income.

While the Gambino family's fortunes have waned, numbers in the once nearly
moribund Bonanno family seem to be surging, officials said.  Since Joseph
Charles Massino, the 52-year-old boss of the family, was released from prison in
1992, the family has mustered 12 active crews and is considered by prosecutors
and agents to have become a formidable crime family again.

The Bonanno and the Genovese families, investigators said, are the only New York
families operating with a full hierarchy of boss, underboss and consigliere, or
counselor, who are not behind bars.

An indication of the importance attached to the regrouping of the Bonanno family
is the F.B.I.'s assignment of Bruce Mouw, who headed the squad that dug up the
evidence that convicted Mr. Gotti and his chief aides, to direct the unit
investigating the Bonanno group.

The Colombo family, which has been shattered by a murderous internal war, also
has a new leader. Investigators said that Andrew T. Russo, a capo, or captain,
was recently promoted to acting boss by Carmine Persico Jr., the family's boss
who is serving a life sentence for racketeering and murder.

Federal agents said that a shaky truce exists between two Colombo factions. Mr.
Russo is a cousin of Carmine Persico's, and agents believe he may be serving as
a caretaker boss until Mr. Persico's son, Alphonse, is installed by his father.

Question Box

BYLINE: By Ray Corio

SECTION: Section C; Page 13, Column 1; Sports Desk

LENGTH: 947 words



QUESTION: What's the closest Dave Winfield of the Yankees ever came to winning
the league's most valuable player award?

It's not as close as Dave Winfield of the Padres came to winning it nine years
ago, when he placed third in the National League. As a Yankee for seven full
seasons, Winfield has never finished better than seventh (in 1981 and 1983) in
the voting for the American League m.v.p. conducted by the Baseball Writers
Association of America, and he has never received a first-place vote. Even in
1984, when he had career highs in batting average (.340), hits (193) and runs
scored (106), Winfield placed eighth to Willie Hernandez of the Detroit Tigers.

Another Willie, Stargell of the Pittsburgh Pirates, as well as Keith Hernandez
of the St. Louis Cardinals, beat out Winfield in the 1979 National League
voting. Stargell, with 10 first-place votes, and Hernandez, with 4, shared the
m.v.p. award with 216 points apiece. Winfield was next with 155 points,
including four first-place votes, after a season in San Diego in which he batted
.308 with 34 home runs and 118 runs batted in.

QUESTION: Aside from George Steinbrenner, who were the other original members of
the group that bought the Yankees from CBS?

The syndicate of 17 that took over the Yankees on Jan. 3, 1973, consisted mostly
of Midwestern business people, plus a couple of recognizable baseball names like
Gabe Paul and Mike Burke, as well as such familiar names in the news as Nelson
Hunt of Dallas, John DeLorean of Detroit, Marvin Warner of Cincinnati and James
Nederlander of Broadway. Also among the investors were Thomas Evans, Lester
Crown, Edward Greenwald, Daniel McCarthy, Edward Ginsberg, Francis O'Neill, Jess
A. Bell, Sheldon Guren, Leslie Combs 2d, and Charlotte Witkind. Besides
Steinbrenner, only Nederlander, McCarthy and Witkind are still part of the
original Yankee ownership, which paid $10 million for the team 15 years ago.

QUESTION: Is it true that John McMullen, who owns the New Jersey Devils, once
owned the Yankees?

It's partly true because he became a part-owner in 1974 when he bought into the
investment group headed by George Steinbrenner that had purchased the Yankees a
year earlier. That was McMullen's first venture into professional sports. His
next came five years later, in May 1979, when he was part of another group that
bought the Houston Astros from the Ford Motor Credit Company. In explaining at
the time why he would foresake a role as a limited partner with Steinbrenner's
Yankees to become a majority owner with Houston, McMullen said, ''There's
nothing more limited than a limited partner of the Yankees.''

On June 30, 1982, he extended his limits farther by purchasing the Colorado
Rockies hockey franchise, moving it to New Jersey, and renaming it the Devils.
As principal owner of both the baseball team in the Astrodome and the hockey
team in the Meadowlands, he's now on the inside looking out.

QUESTION: In the recent Players International men's singles final between Jimmy
Connors and Mats Wilander, a point was won by Wilander when he placed a shot
neatly over the head of his opponent while Connors was at the net. Knowing there
was no chance to get to the ball, Connors, ever the showman, heaved his racquet
in futility at the ball, as a baseball outfielder might do with his glove on a
ball hit over his head. Connors then caught his racquet before it landed. But
what if the racquet had struck the ball and sent it back over the net where
Wilander couldn't return it? Would Connors have won the point, or would he have
had to catch the racquet in order to do so?

Catching the racquet is not the point here; throwing it is. A ball must be
struck with a racquet in a player's hand. Once he loses his grip, he loses the
point, too, whether or not the racquet makes contact with the ball on the court
or above it. So Connors really had nothing to lose by his gesture and he
probably won over the crowd. In baseball, things would have been tougher;
throwing a glove at the ball is worth three bases for the batter.

QUESTION: In college football, Dick Lynch is remembered as the halfback who
scored the touchdown for Notre Dame that snapped Oklahoma's 47-game winning
streak in the late 1950's. In pro football, his reputation was built as an
outstanding defensive back with the powerful Giant teams of the early 60's. Did
he ever perform at running back in the pros?

The only times Lynch got to run with the ball during a nine-year career in the
National Football League from 1958-66 was after he intercepted a pass or
recovered a fumble. Otherwise, he said last week by telephone from his Manhattan
office at the Discount Corporation for government bonds, ''I never had one down
in the pros.''

His most famous down in college was fourth and goal at the Oklahoma 3-yard line
with under 4 minutes to play on Nov. 16, 1957. Lynch, a halfback who also played
defensive back and ran back kickoffs at Notre Dame, swept the right side with a
pitchout and scored the touchdown that handed the Sooners their first loss in
four and a half seasons.

The following year, Lynch was drafted for his defensive skills by the Washington
Redskins, and the year after that, 1959, he joined a Giant team that would win
four conference titles in the next five years, so there was little need to
consider him for running back duties. Besides, in two of those years, 1961 and
1963, Lynch led the N.F.L. in interceptions with nine. His pro career was
curtailed by a spinal injury suffered in a game in 1966, but he closed it out
with these statistics: 37 interceptions for 568 yards and 7 touchdowns, with no
carries from scrimmage.

TENNIS Stroke technique key to power game

BYLINE: By Rod Carlyletennis

SECTION: EXTRA; Section J; Page 4

LENGTH: 316 words


Much has been written about the proliferation of power in tennis today.

Most articles seem to put most of the blame on the new rackets, specifically the
wide-bodies. However, close examination reveals the actual source to be in
stroke production rather than equipment.

The top men's players on the professional tour all use a thin-bodied racket that
has been around for several years, and the racket heads are less than 100 square
inches. In fact, almost none of the top players uses the new wide-bodied
rackets.

So where is all the power coming from? It's not racket technology; it's stroke
technology.

The teachers of just a few years ago would be appalled if they saw one of their
students 'whale' at the ball the way today's players do. Stroke technique used
to stress smooth, rather straight-armed follow- throughs.

Today, faster swings with pronounced forearm snap-ups with the hands actually
finishing over your shoulder are taught. This produces tremendous racket head
speed, which is what generates the power we now see.

The great speed we now see on serves has been developed by finding that the
pronation (rotation) of the wrist during the stroke was the secret.

Look at pictures of any current players serving and you will be able to see
their palms turning outward on the follow-through. Although the measuring
devices used to time serves today are different than those previously used, many
players of yesteryear had serves reported to be as fast as those today, and they
were using wooden rackets.

So if you are searching for that increase in power for your game, the answer may
not be in buying a new racket, but in going to your pro and learning the new
strokes that today's pros are using.

Federer goes big;
Grand Slam king joins fellow stars with larger rackets

BYLINE: Chris Chase, @chaztopher, USA TODAY Sports

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 3C

LENGTH: 439 words


Imagine Tiger Woods using a driver with a hickory shaft or LeBron James wearing
a pair of Chuck Taylors on the court. What if you had to buy Jay-Z's recent
album on cassette and watch NFL games on a 15-inch black-and-white? Can you
thrive in the present while living in the past?

That's the question Roger Federer has been asked for years, as he played with a
classic 90-square-inch racket head while his tennis peers were using modern,
oversized models that helped generate more power. Federer refused to join the
party, staying with the small racket that helped him win 17 Grand Slam singles
tournament titles and set a record for most weeks at No. 1 in the ATP rankings.
But he's struggling in 2013 and has fallen to No. 5  for the first time in
nearly 10years, so that's about to change.

Federer confirmed weeks of suspicion Tuesday, saying he would switch to a
98-square-inch racket head. It's a massive change for the greatest tennis player
of his generation, and one that puts him in line with most of the ATP Tour.
(Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal use 100-inch heads. Andy Murray uses a 98-inch
head.) The idea is that the bigger the racket, the bigger the power.

Federer had been practicing with a blacked-out racket before this week's
tournament in Hamburg. Federer faces Daniel Brands of Germany in his opening
match today.

Federer resisted change for years, much like the man whose Grand Slam record he
surpassed, Pete Sampras.

The American tennis star never went away from his tiny, 85-inch Wilson Pro Staff
6.0. When his career was done, Sampras said he regretted his lack of upgrade.

Will Federer end up regretting his decision to go bigger? Equipment changes
often stymie top golfers, such as Rory McIlroy.

Plus, if it was an easy fix, Federer would have made the switch long ago. He has
been playing for 11 years with a 90-inch frame and now, at 31 and in the
twilight of his career, he's making a major move.

More power, more stability and more precision could follow. It's also easy to
see how this could all go wrong. Perhaps he won't be able to whip his one-handed
backhand as quickly.  If he endures growing pains, how will that affect his
mental game?

He's acknowledged the psychological problem.

"It's also hard to change with all the success I've had with the racket,"
Federer told The New York Times in 2011, when he had won 16 Grand Slams with the
90-inch Wilson.

But Federer has ceded power to the Djokovics and Nadals of the world for too
long. When he was in his prime, he could compensate. Now that his skills are on
the decline, he can't afford to give up that advantage.

Federer is finally catching up with the times.

Keeping Just the Right Zing in the Strings

BYLINE: By ROJA HEYDARPOUR

SECTION: Section B; Column 3; Metropolitan Desk; INK; Pg. 2

LENGTH: 443 words


IN a windowless room next to the hair salon, past the stadiums and the vast open
spaces of the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Queens, 13 stringers
deftly lace the tennis rackets of the players who captivate fans for two weeks
every year at the United States Open.

''This is kind of the Super Bowl of stringing,'' said Ron Rocchi, the global
tour equipment manager for Wilson, which runs the stringing operation at the
tournament.

There are about 100 stringers worldwide who are skilled enough to string rackets
at the most prestigious tennis tournaments, and the group at this year's Open
works from 6:30 a.m. to midnight ensuring that players have rackets with just
the level of tension or flexibility they prefer to compete.

Not surprisingly, this degree of precision brings specialized demands from
players.

Andre Agassi, who retired from professional tennis at this tournament, employed
the same stringer for the last 15 years. Roman Prokes, 46, strung nine rackets
for Mr. Agassi on match days -- one for practice and eight for the match. Every
time new balls were used during a match, Mr. Agassi changed his racket. With so
many rackets in use, Mr. Prokes was sometimes on his feet for more than four and
a half hours without a break adjusting Mr. Agassi's most important tools. Simply
put, if too much time passed between stringings, the strings would loosen.

During a match, Mr. Prokes was not on the court, however. He was in a brightly
lighted room with the rest of the stringers, watching his boss on television and
readying himself for any problems. If a string broke, someone -- a ball boy or
girl, or a coach -- ran to the stringing room and Mr. Prokes got to work. This
was when the delicacy and challenge of the craft became visible, because he had
to string the racket quickly to get it back to Mr. Agassi, but not so quickly
that he sacrificed the quality of the stringing.

Mr. Prokes, a political refugee from what was then Czechoslovakia, moved to the
United States 30 years ago, and after working odd jobs he turned his tennis
hobby into a career by learning to string rackets. He found a job at a tennis
club in Long Island City, Queens, and worked his way up to owning a stringing
business in Manhattan, with superstar clients like Mr. Agassi and John McEnroe.

By the time the Open ends, the stringers will use enough string to stretch from
the tennis center around the Statue of Liberty and back.

As Mr. Prokes pulled the strings on Mr. Agassi's final racket for the day, he
said: ''This is the winning racket. I hope so. I hope so.'' Mr. Agassi won that
night, and delayed his retirement at least one more match.

SQUASH/Support from Barrington

SECTION: WEEKEND SPORT; IN TIME'S EYE; Pg. 17

LENGTH: 289 words


JONAH Barrington, six-times British Open squash champion, is threatening to
'throw away his crutches' and play in the British championships in Manchester
next month if leading players carry out their proposed boycott of the event.

The boycott, which the players claim would include the entire England top 20,
looks certain to go ahead following a rejection' 'of their demands yesterday by
the English Squash Rackets Association.

Now 51, Barrington, the association's director of excellence, said: "1 am
disappointed with the players' 'actions. They do not appreciate the negative
effect their actions may have on commercial sponsorship in the future. 1 am even
considering throwing away my crutches just to demonstrate my support for the
event in difficult times."

The players originally demanded increased prize-money, the restoration of the
British Closed title instead of the proposed English Closed, and the use of a
four-sided glass court at the event, which is not sponsored this year.

The association would not agree and in an effort to compromise, the players
amended their demand to a relaxation of the England eligibility rule so players
would be free to enter the tournament or not on its merits. However, that was
rejected too.

Phil Whitlock, England team captain, said: "This is just black-mail by the SRA.
They are trying to force us to play in a devalued event where the prize money is
half what it was five years ago.

 Frenchman Julien Bonetat reached the last 16 of a major squash tournament for
the first time yesterday when he scored a shock win over Adrian Davies of Wales
at the Qatar International. Bonetat swept aside the world number 17 for a
convincing 15-7, 15-12, 15-7 victory.

DEALER WARNS BUYERS;
SUNDAY SPOTLIGHT

LUXURY-car dealers in Sydney said last week they were aware of the racket in
stolen Porsches. Dale Goodman, manager of John Newell Porsche Centre in
Darlinghurst, warned that many motorists may be driving "hotter cars" than they
imagined if they had not bought their Porsches from authorised agents.

"The Californian racket sounds very, very big and I would not be surprised if
there were a few celebrities unknowingly driving around in stolen Porsches," he
said.

"If people haven't bought a Porsche from a legitimate dealer then I would
suggest they check their cars for peace of mind."

Mr Goodman said such rackets hurt legitimate dealers.

"We have always helped police in these kinds of matters, such as identifying
models," he said.

"Illegal operations like this hurt our business.

"We pay the duty and the sales tax and we have cars that are genuine. Our
business suffers when backyard dealers operate with falsified records."

His Porsche centre does not deal with private imports.

"We insist on Australian design compliance plates, which are only on cars
imported into Australia by importers or manufacturers," he said.

"The scallywag dealers must be desperate for money and there are people out
their willing to shut their eyes when they buy cars from backyard dealers who
are not registered motor traders.

"A few were advertising extensively last year and they were easy to spot
-Porsches with left-hand drive for considerably lower than normal prices."

As an example, Mr Goodman said a 1988 911 Carrera would sell in Sydney for
around $110,000.

"If it was stolen in Los Angeles and had a left-to-right hand conversion it
could sell for between $85,000 and $90,000 in Sydney.

"People are blinded by the bargain and are willing to rush out and buy it and
don't think about having it checked out."

John Thompson, from Chatswood Classic Cars, said he would refuse any offer of a
Porsche converted from left to right hand drive.

"Once we find out it has been converted, we don't want anything to do with it,"
he said.

"Not just because of the risk that it is stolen but basically because the
vehicles often do not meet design compliance plates standards and are also very
hard to sell.

"Buying a Porsche to many people is like buying a racehorse - they want to see
the log books and the compliance plates."

"People willing to buy cars without these are just looking for a bargain."

Santa Fe Open: Racquet scene seeing revival

BYLINE: James Barron, The Santa Fe New Mexican

SECTION: SPORTS

LENGTH: 615 words


May 22--Jake Matthews needed some momentum to kickstart the tennis bug at El
Gauncho Fitness Swim and Racquet Club.

He sees the Santa Fe Open as a way to help generate that.

Matthews, the tennis director at the club, is trying to reinvigorate the racquet
scene in Santa Fe -- be it tennis, racquetball or squash -- and he saw progress
this weekend with the third Santa Fe Open. The tennis/squash tournament made
steady gains in participation over the past two years after foregoing the 2014
event to reorganize it. In all, about 125 players competed in both sports at El
Gauncho, with the squash portion ending Saturday afternoon.

Tennis gets center stage Sunday as the doubles and singles finals in several
divisions will take place beginning at 9 a.m.

Matthews said the number of players overall increased by about 20 percent from
the 2015 tournament, and he credits a larger purse for the players as well as
improved sponsorship that attract a stronger field.

This year, the draw included former University of New Mexico player Sam
Iftikhar, who was the Lobos' No. 1 singles and doubles player and tours on the
Association of Tennis Players circuit.

"It's getting bigger and bigger every year," Matthews said. "This year, we were
able to have $1,500 in prize money for the tennis players and $800 for the
squash players."

As good as the money is for the players, El Gauncho also is working with the
nonprofit group Reel Fathers, which focuses on strengthening relationships
between fathers and their children through the use of film and the arts. Deborah
Boldt, Reel Fathers' executive director, said Matthews approached her group as a
way to give back to the community after many businesses threw their support
behind the tournament.

The big event for the organization was a raffle Saturday afternoon that
generated the bulk of the proceeds for Reel Fathers. Last year, it raised about
$700, and Boldt believes that total might grow this time.

"We feel very fortunate, because this is the third year we've been the
beneficiary," Boldt said. "Each year, the tournament has grown, and we're very
honored by that. The income means a lot to us."

While tennis received the bulk of the players, the squash portion of the
tournament grew to three division. The largest was the 4.0 division (based on a
players' skill level), which had nine in all. Michael Munson won that division,
but one of the more thrilling matches was for third place between Bruce
Bernstein and Donovan Duran. It lasted five games before Bernstein outlasted
Duran 11-9 to take third.

Bernstein was drawn to the sport by its parallels to racquetball, and it was one
he learned over the past five years.

"It was great to pick up something new, and it was a challenge to learn from
scratch," Bernstein said. "It's a great mental and physical workout, and I've
worked pretty hard to get better."

Meanwhile, Matthews took off his "tennis director" hat and took to the courts
for singles and doubles play, and the 2009 St. Michael's graduate comported
himself quite well. He beat the second-seeded Bobby Bull in straight sets, 6-4,
6-4, and will face Iftikhar in the open finals at 11 a.m. Sunday.

In the doubles portion, Matthews and partner Brad Lawrence will take on Iftikhar
and Bull at 9 a.m. for the open title.

"It's been great getting back out there," Matthews said. "I've really, really
enjoyed it, and the weather's been great, too."

Matthews hopes that the sunshine is indicative of what is to come for the Santa
Fe Open, and tennis in general in Santa Fe, too.

TENNIS CLASS:

BYLINE: Rod Carlyle; Time to tune up racket for new seasontennis; equipment

SECTION: EXTRA; SECTION J; PAGE 07

LENGTH: 427 words


Now that March is here, spring tennis fever will start to hit us, especially
when we experience a few 70-degree days. So now is the time to do a spring
tuneup of our tennis game.

In the past couple of weeks we have discussed changing a stroke and changing
rackets.

The off-season is the best time for changing a stroke because it takes time, and
changing while involved in matches is difficult, as you'll usually revert back
to your old comfortable way of hitting the ball.

Changing rackets is best done in the off-season so you will have time to adjust
to your new weapon. If you can play with your new racket for at least two weeks
before the start of a new season, you should get the feel for all your shots.
That way you can play with confidence when competition begins.

One item often overlooked is getting your equipment in shape. Check your strings
and grip to make sure they are ready for the new season. It is easy to see if
the grip is in bad shape, but the strings can need replacing even though they
look fine.

There are two factors related to the strings that come into play when you hit
the ball - string tension and elasticity.

It is fairly easy to check the tension. Some shops have a device to measure
string tension. One important point to remember is that the tension at which a
racket is strung is not the tension at which the racket remains. The resultant
tension is actually less. A good stringer can tell you if you have lost a
considerable amount, which means you should have your racket restrung.

The elasticity of the strings is something that you will feel. The ball will
start to feel like a baseball when you hit it, and your shots will not have any
pace on them and will start landing short.

This can happen even though your string tension remains high. That's why a
racket that has been in your closet for a year may still have good string
tension, but hit bad. The strings have lost their elasticity.

One simple way to keep your strings up to date is by having your racket restrung
as many times a year as you play a week. So if you play an average of two times
a week, have your racket restrung twice a year. Here again, the best time to do
this is between seasons so you can get used to the way it hits before you play a
match.

Next week: More stringing tips.

Donate a racquet' successful

SECTION: Sport; Pg. 26

LENGTH: 155 words


THE International Badminton Federation's "Donate a racquet" campaign for
54 countries, where badminton is being developed, have managed to collect
4,000 racquets.

The campaign, launched in November last year and ends with the Olympic
Games in Atlanta, has been a huge success considering that the target was
2,500.

The scope of the scheme was broadened with the purchase of inexpensive
racquets to supplement those donated by badminton fans around the world.

Vladislav Druzchenko of Ukraine used some of the racquets at the
European championships in April where he beat second seed Soren B.
Nielsen.

Andrew Ryan, IBF director of development and the campaign's organiser,
is pleased to hear the success of the scheme.

"It feels good to hear that Druzchenko has qualified for the mixed
doubles for the Olympics. He will be using one of the rackets under the
donation campaign in Atlanta," said Ryan.

DATELINE: Lincoln, NE


Is the Dodgers' Eric Gagne any relation to Verne Gagne, who was a great wrestler
in the 1950s and '60s? Where is Vern Gagne now? Has he died? D.J.K.

It seems on the surface they are not related.

But Eric Gagne won the Cy Young Award for the Dodgers in 2003. Verne Gagne won a
number of world titles and other championships and was the founder of the
American Wrestling Association. Eric Gagne is a Canadian and pitched at Seminole
Junior College in Oklahoma. Verne Gagne was born in Minnesota, won four Big Ten
titles and two NCAA titles.

Eric Gagne has a fastball and a great changeup. Verne Gagne had the drop kick
and the sleeper hold.

Greg Gagne, the son of Verne Gagne, was also a pro wrestler. Greg Gagne, the
baseball player for the Twins, Dodgers and Royals, did not turn to pro
wrestling. They are not closely related.

Verne Gagne is living in Minnesota and raises money for the U.S. Olympic team
and University of Minnesota wrestling. Eric Gagne is pitching for the Dodgers,
who are struggling at this point.

But here's the interesting part.

Verne Gagne had to wrestle Nick Bockwinkle and coached Ric Flair, Ricky
Steamboat and others. Eric Gagne watched Rocky and Bullwinkle, pitches with a
certain flair and has seen a steamboat. Lincoln had a secretary named Kennedy.
Kennedy was in a Lincoln convertible in Dallas. ...

Also, the Rev. Billy Graham and wrestler "Superstar Billy Graham" are apparently
not related, but both are currently evangelists.

How come in tennis you have a racket or a racquet? It doesn't make a racket
unless you throw it. J.M.

The word racket comes from the Arab word "Rahat," meaning palm of the hand.
Interestingly, Edward Farhat (real name) was known as "The Sheik" in pro
wrestling. The Sheik was not related to "the Iron Sheik." Back to tennis. Tennis
was originally played with bare hands and the "net" was a rope. By the way, the
scoring in tennis, 15-30-40 game, goes back to the game of pallone. Pallone is a
national ball game in Italy, with a wall, a midcourt line, a pallone (ball) and
a bracciale (bat). There are two teams of three players and a guy (mandarino)
who plays for both teams. There is no mention if the mandarino is related to the
red, sweet fruit that goes into a Shirley Temple cocktail.

Is it true that a golfer once keeled over from putting his golf tee in his
mouth? S.G.

Yes. You might think what happened was he also put the ball on the tee and his
playing partner smashed the side of his face with his driver. But the truth,
according to Snopes.com, was that in 1982, Navy Lt. George Prior, 30, played 36
holes of golf at the Army-Navy Country Club in Arlington, Va., and started
complaining of headaches. In a few hours, he was feverish and nauseated and
developed a rash. He died 10 days later after most of the skin from his body had
burned away and his major organs began to fail. Daconil, a fungicide that was
sprayed on the course twice a week,  was deemed the culprit.

Please help me, I'm falling at 473-7313 or at khambleton@journalstar.com.

Racquet Club men aiming for 3.5 national title

BYLINE: NANCY MORGAN

SECTION: NEIGHBORHOOD TIMES; TENNIS; Pg. 18

LENGTH: 775 words



Today and Thursday, players on the Racquet Club of St. Petersburg's 3.5 men's
team will be traveling to Tucson, Ariz., for the USA League Tennis National
Championships.

Mike Williams, the top singles player for the team, is cautiously confident
about the team's chances among 16 other teams representing U.S. Tennis
Association sections.

"Now that we've made it this far, it's really exciting," said Williams. "We've
added some depth to the team this year, and although we really didn't know how
we would do locally, we came through in the clutch. Hopefully, we'll do the same
at nationals."

After winning the local competition, regional and state play was especially
tough, said Williams, and a little luck combined with consistency resulted in
success.

"The last two years we've lost 3-2 to Hunters Green in Tampa," said Williams.
"When we beat them, we knew our depth was a key factor."

Williams and John McQuillen will fill the two singles positions at the nationals
and will be supported by Scott Johnston and Scott Stewart in No. 1 doubles, Jack
Weldon and Earl Gehant in No. 2, and captain Bob Dickerson and either Bob Wahl
or Steve Uebel in No. 3. Rounding out the team and expected to play key roles
are Vaughn Haight, Eathan Ray and Jeff Doty. Team members Neel Voss and Ray
Cianci are unable to participate.

"At our club championships last weekend, John and I won the doubles title," said
Williams. "We beat Earl (Gehant) and Jack (Weldon) in the final after they had
beaten Scott (Johnston) and Scott (Stewart) earlier. That shows how strong the
depth on our team is. On a given day, time or place, any team can beat the
other."

The Racquet Club has a practice time on the hard courts at Tucson's Randolph
Park Thursday to help acclimate to the thin air and low humidity. The team plays
twice on Friday and once Saturday in its flight of four teams. The top team in
each of four flights enters semifinal action Sunday morning, followed by the
final.

FEATURE SOUND RETURNS: At the 3.0 USA League Tennis National Championships
earlier this month, Feather Sound Country Club's men fell 3-2 in each of their
flight matches against teams from Kansas, Hawaii and California. The Feather
Sound team played a third-set tiebreaker in nine of its 15 individual matches,
winning two.

Winning for Feather Sound were Lon Caffee in No. 1 singles and Bob Dilonardo in
No. 2 against Kansas; Caffee and Hicks in No. 1 doubles and Greg Miller and
David Smith in No. 3 against Hawaii, and Caffee in No. 1 singles and Miller and
Smith in No. 3 doubles against California.

California advanced to the final, where it lost to a team from Georgia.

RACQUET CLUB WINNERS: Peter Haggar of St. Petersburg defeated Rob Perry 7-6
(7-4), 6-2 to win the men's open final in this month's Tournament Players Club
Fall Open at the Racquet Club of St. Petersburg. Howie Banfield of Anna Maria
Island won the men's 45-and-over final in straight sets.

Haggar is a 1986 graduate of St. Petersburg Catholic High School where he and
his older brothers, John and Paul, were members of the school's tennis team.
John is currently the tennis director at the Racquet Club while Peter works in
the family wholesale window treatment business.

SPEEDY RECOVERY: Al Sarmiento suffered a torn rotator cuff while competing in
the men's 70s state singles championship in West Palm Beach this month.
Sarmiento, a former club tennis director, a state-ranked player in both singles
and doubles, and a friend to tennis, is wished a full recovery from this month's
shoulder surgery.

FLORIDA TURNS 50: This weekend marks Florida's 50th anniversary as a separate
section within the USTA and it will be celebrated at the Shula Hotel and Resort
in Miami Lakes. In the past year, Florida has been among the leaders in the
17-section USTA with more than 33,000 members, including more than 500
volunteers and about 20 full- or part-time staff coordinating junior and adult
recreational and competitive programs throughout the state.

During the weekend, leaders such as Ed Turville of St. Petersburg, Florida's
first president from 1949-1951, will be recognized, volunteers achieving
outstanding success this year will be honored, and plans will be presented.

MOLINA IN CLAY COURT QUARTERS: Andres Molina, former teaching professional in
St. Petersburg now working in Tampa, reached the quarterfinals of the 128-player
draw in this month's USTA National Men's 40s Clay Court Championships in
Savannah, Ga. Jeff Davis of St. Petersburg advanced to the third round. Other
local players in the national event were Jeff Winkler, Van Gladfelter, Tom
Layton and Gewan Maharaj.

BEYOND BELIEF

BYLINE: JOHN ILLMAN

LENGTH: 403 words


THE CHAMPIONS of Wimbledon are unlikely to succumb to tennis elbow - a misnamed
condition which has given rise to a myth. The truth is that the pain and
tenderness of epicondylitis is more frequently seen in housewives who have had a
busy day stirring jam or beating pudding mixture, or in over-energetic gardeners
or DIY enthusiasts. It is a repetitive strain injury caused by microscopic tears
which develop in tendons exposed to a repeated stress greater than the tissues
can withstand.

Of course, tennis players are vulnerable - about half those playing three times
weekly are said to suffer eventually. Beginners are also vulnerable - so if, for
the first time, Wimbledon has inspired you, be careful on court. Don't overdo
it.

Many experienced amateurs suffer through playing with too heavy a racket or poor
technique. The University of California Wellness Letter gives these tips:

- Try a mid-sized racket which has a bigger sweeter spot and absorbs vibration
better than a smaller one. It plays softer and gives more power, so you don't
need to swing as hard. An oversized racket, in contrast, can in-

crease the risk of the racket twisting if you hit the ball off centre.

- Chose a flexible racket - one that is injection moulded or that contains a
high proportion of fibre glass - which will dampen shock as well. Composite
rackets with an increased ratio of nylon matrix, as opposed to epoxy resin, are
reported to be good shock absorbers.

- An increased grip size can also help. Too small a grip can lead to arm muscle
fatigue from holding the racket too tight. However, too large a grip may inhibit
power.

- Lower your string tension to dampen shock - usually two to three pounds lower
than the manufacturer's low-range suggestion. Higher string tension does give
more control, but also increases the shock to your arm after impact.

What about technique? Try to power your serve and backhand with your legs, body
and shoulders, not your wrist and forearm. The Wellness Letter also recommends:
" Beginners should learn a two-handed backhand."

Exercises also have a protective effect. Dr Robert Nirschl, director of the
Virginia Sports Medicine Institute, estimates that half tennis elbow sufferers
have major strength deficits in the shoulder and upper back, and prescribes

COLUMN: ON THE JOB

Marsha P. Hayward

Certified racquetball pro; director of programs

Wayside Racquet & Swim Club, Marlboro

Age: 60

Family: Single

Native of: Fort Fairfield, Maine, and grew up in Perth, New Brunswick, Canada.

Lives in: Hudson

Time in job: 19 years

What do you do?

"I teach people who have never played racquetball all the way to league and
tournament players. I coach, and I also manage all the racquetball programs at
the club."

What is racquetball?

"Racquetball is an indoor game in which a small ball is batted against a wall or
walls with a racquet. The racquet has a handle that's shorter than a tennis
racquet. Players alternate hitting the ball."

How did you get into this job?

"I had just moved to Hudson from Waltham in 1982. Then a cop friend introduced
me to racquetball. I fell in love with racquetball immediately. I never took
lessons, but I was always an athlete. After I played him twice, I was beating
him regularly. Then a year later, all my friends joined Wayside to play tennis,
so I did, too. I played tennis for a while, but one day I walked over to the
racquetball courts, and the rest is history. Deb Williams was the women's
racquetball coach at the time - she still lives in Upton. She said something
about me being a hot-shot tennis player, but only a B racquetball player. So, I
would play against her and she would give me tips. I wound up as her racquetball
partner for three years, and I wound up taking her job when she left the club to
raise her family. I went to Rhode Island and became AmPro (International
Professional Racquetball Organization) certified."

What did you do before you did this?

"I was an instructor of dental assisting at Boston University; I graduated seven
classes of dental assistants for BU. After that, I was the manager of the dental
department at Beth Israel Hospital."

What made you decide to change careers?

"I was 28 when my dad died (of a massive coronary). I didn't want to die young.
There was a lot of stress in my other jobs. His passing had a great deal to do
with this decision."

Who plays racquetball?

"Any one, any age, any level - racquetball is an inexpensive sport. Plus, the
stress relief and it's a great cardiovascular workout. The best part of
racquetball is meeting other people and making friends. It's not boring like
being on a treadmill for an hour."

What did you do when you first started at the club?

"I increased all the racquetball programs, leagues, lessons and junior classes
by 75 percent. We have four courts here and I began by filling all the courts.
It still remains that way today even though they say we're a dying sport - not
here!"

Do you enjoy teaching racquetball?

"I love teaching, and I love to play racquetball. One simple answer is that when
people come to me and say they want to learn to play the sport, I tell them that
when they walk onto the court and hit the ball - they will fall in love with the
game. I start kids at 5 if they're athletically inclined. John-Craig Chisholm is
19 now, and he is a nationally ranked junior player. He lives in Marlboro; I
probably taught him for 11 years. His sister, Courtney, is 16, and she is also a
nationally ranked junior champ. She was world champion in 2009."

Have you ever been nationally ranked?

"I was ranked second nationally in women's U.S. Racquetball Association Division
A in 1991."

Did you have a mentor?

"Fran Davis. She has been a national champion, the U.S. national coach and U.S.
Olympic coach. I've been to her camps. Everything I do and everything I've done
has to do with what she taught me."

What's the best part of your job?

"I don't walk onto the court - or either do any of these people who play here -
without being happy. Racquetball players are the best people ... look at them,
look at how happy they are - they don't look like they're going to the dentist."

Is there a worst part?

"Truthfully, seeing people get injured. Like when someone sprains an ankle.
Thankfully, that doesn't happen often."

Ron Hughes

SECTION: FEATURES; Pg.63

LENGTH: 686 words


* Ron Hughes, rackets player, was born on November 25, 1920. He died on July 1,
2008, aged 87

* Leading rackets professional who mentored the students of Malvern College

The former Malvern College rackets professional Ron Hughes was one of the game's
great characters who rose effortlessly above the hierarchical system which
regarded professionals as forelock-tugging servants to become one of the most
popular and widely respected players of his generation. He was also an
outstanding real tennis player and challenged for the world title in 1966.

Hughes was born in 1920 into a working-class family in Gorton, Manchester, and,
after leaving school at 14, worked first as a ballboy and then an assistant
professional at the Manchester Real Tennis and Racquet Club, a stint interrupted
by eight years' wartime service with the Royal Air Force in North Africa and
Europe, including the D-Day landings.

His athleticism and immaculate stroke play brought him scores of real tennis
titles throughout the 1950s and 1960s. He won a string of British open and
professional championships despite strong competition from stars, including
Henry Johns, Jim Dear, David Warburg and Frank Willis, and in 1965 he captured
the first open invitation tournament for the field trophy, a miniature silver
racket that remains the game's most exquisite prize.

He became a rackets professional at Malvern College in 1956, which restricted
his real tennis opportunities, as Malvern was two hours' drive from the nearest
courts. Despite this, however, he challenged Norty Knox, the American
multimillionaire amateur, in 1966 for the world real tennis title in New York,
suffering a 7-0 drubbing, mainly through lack of practice.

Hughes's greatest gift, however, was as a teacher and mentor of the young and
among his outstanding Malvernian pupils were the junior champions Philip Rosser,
David Jenkins, Andrew McDonald and the brothers Paul and Mark Nicholls, who won
a series of national schools doubles titles, Mark also twice winning the
prestigious Foster Cup singles crown during a purple patch in the mid-1970s when
Malvern dominated the game at schoolboy level.

Hughes was less interested in amassing championship trophies, however, than in
imparting his own skills and philosophy to even the least talented of his boys.
Tim Henman's brother, Mike, who spent hours a day practising rackets and having
lessons with Hughes, once asked him what his greatest moment in the game had
been, expecting him to say one of the Nicholls brothers' triumphs. He was
amazed, however, when Hughes said it was the day that one of his keenest but
least naturally talented former pupils returned from Oxford to play a practice
doubles match with a high-quality Malvern first pair. Hughes imagined that the
undergraduate would be outclassed but he played doggedly and well, remembering
all Hughes's tips - "While it's in play, you're in business" and "Take care of
the points and the games will look after themselves". Despite losing narrowly,
he gave a terrific account of himself, to the astonishment of the spectators.

For Hughes, the welfare and happiness of his pupil, the journeymen just as much
as the champions, was paramount and during his time, a record number, around 80
of the school's 600 boys, played rackets and took part in inter school matches.

Bernard Weatherill, QC, son of the former Speaker of the Commons, and Mike and
Richard Henman, who under his tutelage all became fine all-round racket sports
players, idolised him, like most of Hughes's boys, believing that the lessons
they had learnt from him were hugely character-building and helped set their
path through life. Many continued to visit him up to the day he died.

Weatherill recalls: "We all adored and loved him. He had an incredibly positive
influence on generation after generation of Malvernians, and very many of us
regarded Sundays, watching TV with his wonderfully supportive wife Vera, as a
safe haven."

Ron Hughes retired in 1986 and he and Vera celebrated 60 years of marriage in
2007.

He is survived by his wife and their son.

Twin handles prove to be double trouble; Funky rackets are helping brothers

BYLINE: Marc Weber, The Province

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A48

LENGTH: 371  words


Laugh them off at your peril.

Playing with their funny-looking, two-handled rackets that have been compared to
hedge clippers, a tuning fork, a divining rod and jumper cables, the Battistone
brothers have climbed from nowhere to the top 350 doubles players in the world.

They won their first match of the Odlum Brown Vancouver Open on Wednesday and
will play again today around 2 p.m.

Dann, 31, and Brian, 28, think if they win a Challenger event they've got a
serious shot at a U.S. Open wildcard; their freaky appeal tipping the scales.

They may be a sideshow -- a warm-up session Monday turned into an impromptu
clinic for 30 fascinated kids -- but they are one that demands to be taken
seriously.

"There's just no comparison," Dann says of hitting with two hands, gripping the
racket like a giant wishbone. "Think about moving a car. Would you push from the
middle, or would you push from the back and pull from the front?"

And with one hand, they say, there are more shots available because the handles
jut out at 35 degrees. There's also a deception element with being able to flip
the racket and dramatically alter angles quickly.

"Our first match, there were maybe 10 points we won because of the racket."

Both are former pros from, where else, Las Vegas. They quit the tour in 2000,
going on separate Mormon missions to Rio de Janeiro -- they speak Portuguese on
court -- but before Brian left he hooked up with the racket's Canadian-born
inventor, Lionel Burt.

Seeing health benefits in arm alignment and balancing out the body, Burt gained
International Tennis Federation approval.

Brian, known for his 130-mph volleyball-like jump serve (check out YouTube),
worked on the prototype before a family connection with Easton Sports sped up
the process.

"I learned to do a lot with a blowtorch, screws and welding glue," he says.

The brothers returned to the tour -- new rackets in hand -- in October 2007,
going in 50/50 with Burt on the business side. They've sold 100.

They soon won a Futures event in Baton Rouge, La.

"The highest ranking I had in doubles was, like, 800 in 2000," says Dann. "Then,
all of a sudden, I take seven years off and now we're closing in on the 200s.
That shouldn't really happen."

Squash: Sponsorship money dulls the senses

BYLINE: COLIN MCQUILLAN

SECTION: Issue 62584.

LENGTH: 419 words


Squash rackets is deeply competitive. It has been labelled boxing without brain
damage but, over the last few days, there have been certain developments to
suggest that analogy is not necessarily universal.

The successful American Express national league started its third season on
Tuesday, dominated by the introduction of lunchtime fixtures on Britain's first
permanent, transparent glass showcourt, at Cannons Club in London. The arrival
of this arena is a direct challenge to the year-old decision of the Squash
Rackets Association to subsidize its own, demountable, Perspex showcourt by
adding hire arrangements to its private usage in major tournaments.


The SRA is privately peeved at what promises to be considerably cheaper
opposition in the court-hire market, but publicly welcomes another facet in the
ever-increasing profile of squash.

Cannons stretched official goodwill further, however, by signing a private
sponsorship deal with InterCity, already heavily committed to the game. American
Express are even less enthusiastic about the arrangement; John Peterson, the
vice-president, was infuriated by the submerging of his company's identity under
the announcements of the club sponsor.

Cannons have also decided to mount a major international tournament on their new
court. 'There is a slot on the calendar just before the British Open
Championships which we have nominated for,' the Cannons manager, Gary Oliver,
said. 'We would like to make our tournament a regular warm-up event to the
British Open at Wembley, the equivalent of Queens to Wimbledon in tennis. '

A wonderful idea, until mischievous journalism promotes it into a rival to the
Open, designed to replace this prestigious tournament on the international grand
prix circuit, which itself is an interesting quantity. It exists, as yet, as the
hopeful experiment of a new body, the Men's International Squash Tournament
Council.

Its framework is the burgeoning open tournament circuit, which MISTC is doing
much to enlarge but which still depends heavily upon historic national
tournaments, such as the British Open. However, until such elements as
protection for individual organisations and sponsors are decided, the SRA
chooses not to include its major event on the list.

RESULTS: Inter-City-Cannons 4, Visco Monroe 1; Poundstretcher Dunnings Mill 5,
Arrow Village Prestwich 0; Chapel Allerton 5, Ardleigh Hall 0; Halls West
Country 1, Manchester Northern 4; Skol Leicester 4, Home Ales Nottingham 1.

You are invited to learn the game of paddle

BYLINE: NANCY MORGAN

SECTION: NEIGHBORHOOD TIMES; TENNIS; Pg. 18

LENGTH: 546 words

DATELINE: CLEARWATER



The Racquet Club of St. Petersburg, a membership-owned tennis facility, has
been busy lately and hopes to be even more so in the future.

Last month, the club opened its doors to the public, offering unlimited  play so
people can learn about the club. Last weekend, tennis director Hans  Gallauer
hosted the third and final U.S. Tennis Association Junior Satellite
Championships. This week, the Gallauer-McCain Tennis Academy begins operating
at the club. Finally, for the next three months, an open invitation is  extended
to all people interested in trying the sport of paddle.

At the satellite event, Racquet Club player Lauren "Bugsby" Bouer won  the girls
10 title and Jenna Ruth was a finalist in the girls 14. Other St.  Petersburg
winners were Kaela Kennedy (girls 12), Jessica Malmad (girls 16)  and John Brett
(boys 14).

"The tennis academy plans to cover a full level of players from the  beginner to
the nationally ranked," Gallauer said. "We especially want to  reach this
satellite level, which we think are often overlooked."

Gallauer is teaming with tennis professional David McCain, formerly of
Bardmoor, the father of state-ranked players Kelly and Dan.

Paddle was introduced to the Racquet Club by member Neel Voss, who was
intrigued by the sport while watching it on the Sunshine Network. Voss learned
more about it, tried out the sport with Gallauer and managed to get it to the
Racquet Club for a trial basis.

"Paddle involves 75 percent tennis skills and 25 percent racquetball  skills,"
Voss said. "Playing paddle can really help your tennis game."

Paddle is played on a court smaller than a tennis court, uses a racquet  similar
to the old paddleball racquet and a regular tennis ball. According to  Voss,
scoring is the same as in tennis and doubles-only is the format.

"The public is invited for a $ 5 guest fee to come to the Racquet Club to  try
paddle," Voss said. "This is the only existing paddle court in Florida  and
there are only 20 in the United States compared to 30,000 in Argentina."

Those interested in learning more about paddle can call the Racquet Club  at
527-6553.

    MIXED MEETING: Thursday is the captains' meeting day for the USTA BMW  Mixed
Doubles League. Local Coordinator Jim Adams plans to begin the league in
November with 6.5, 7.5, 8.5 and 9.5 divisions. The meeting is at 7 p.m. at
Royal Racquet Club in Clearwater. For questions, call Adams at 321-7847.

    ANNUAL MEETING: The St. Petersburg Bayfront Hilton is the host site of  this
weekend's 47th Annual Meeting of the USTA/Florida Section. More than 300
volunteers from across the state are expected to participate in teambuilding,
seminars and tennis. This year, the section reached the 30,000 member goal and
is a leader among the 17 USTA sections in membership.

    WORLD TEAMTENNIS: The top four teams from the World TeamTennis  Professional
League will compete Dec. 14-15 for the King Cup at Saddlebrook  Resort in Wesley
Chapel. Players participating this season are Martina  Navratilova, John McEnroe
and the Jensen brothers.

Groups of 20 or more can get a ticket discount; the group organizer  receives a
complimentary ticket. For information, call 538-0222.

Scottish eyes are smiling at Nicol win

Squash Richard Jago

Peter Nicol could have been forgiven if he felt ambivalent that his attempt to
become the first player to win the British Open in his home city of Aberdeen is
taking place in an tournament backed by the Eye Group.

The management company's sponsorship may have saved a British Open at risk of
collapse for the first time in its 67-year history but the tournament's full
title now sounds like a satire on the conditions faced by the defending champion
during his first-round win yesterday over a qualifier, Anthony Ricketts.

That was because the perspex court arrived in Scotland from the (English) Squash
Rackets Association so flecked with marks that only players with the eyes of an
eagle were able to locate balls clinging to the side walls.

Nicol is certainly in that category and his 1511, 1513, 159 victory over the
promising young Australian contained few alarms. He gave plenty of indications
that whatever is thrown at him against whatever background he will not blink at
handling it.

Yesterday this included an entry into the arena behind the unnerving strains of
a bagpipe and testing support from hundreds of local schoolchildren, some of
whom yelled like seagulls for two games and then departed abruptly before the
third.

Nicol nevertheless learnt enough to know that the warmish conditions will suit
his patient, manoeuvring style and they will be significantly different from
those either in Cairo or in Boston, where he has been beaten in the past three
weeks.

Britain's other world champion, Cassie Campion, also won. For the second
successive day the top-seeded Englishwoman beat an Australian, overcoming the
former world junior champion Rachael Grinham 93, 90, 94 to reach the quarter
-finals.

'I got up at 7.30am to make sure I got a practice on this," said Campion, who
had played her first round on conventional courts.

Her eye, she said without a trace of a pun, was in.

It's hip to be (in the) square again: Being twisted, warped and high-strung is
all part of the fun at festival time

DATELINE: EDMONTON


EDMONTON - When Alakazam decided to bend the boundaries of his juggling act a
bit, he thought of learning to squeeze himself through the unstrung oval of a
tennis racket.

No, too easy, he figured. So he took up the narrower, more dramatic squash
racket instead.

The 27-year-old Australian contortionist demonstrated the fruits of his twisted
labour Wednesday, wriggling his whole five- foot-11 frame through an unstrung
racket outside City Hall, and told jokes while he did it. It caught people's
attention.

"Does my butt look big in this?" he asked as the racket reached his hips after
passing his compliant rib cage.

"I just wanted to do something that would really make people stop and really
watch because juggling wasn't really cutting it," Alakazam said after the launch
of the 21st annual Edmonton International Street Performers Festival, running
Friday through July 17 in Sir Winston Churchill Square.

The festival has come home to the newly renovated square after a year in Old
Strathcona. Still, it wouldn't be at all surprising if an organization that
thrives on itinerant talent had no fixed address.

Besides the stretch of 99th Street that's usually cut off, this year a block of
102A Avenue will also be closed to traffic other than unicycles and Hokum W.
Jeebs's Piano a la Cart, a modified upright keyboard the Seattle pianist wheels
around busking sites the world over.

The square has a decided slope to it that some acts requiring a flat surface
would find precarious.

"When you're up on a ladder or up on a pole, the angle really does matter,"
admits festival director Shelley Switzer. She says the additional street space
will help deal with such concerns.

Jeebs figures he's been to at least half of the street festivals here, and this
year he's added an innovation to his appearance. Jeebs ran a silent movie house
in Seattle for 10 years, where he embellished the drama and the comedy of the
early films on a Wurlitzer organ he built himself.

Every evening at 9 in the ATB Financial tent, Jeebs will show one of the many
silent flicks from his collection. The highlight of the mini filmfest will be
Monday's screening on City Hall Plaza of Charlie Chaplin's 1925 classic The Gold
Rush, accompanied for the whole 90 minutes by Jeebs himself.

"The hook (of the filmfest) is the silent movie clowns did a lot of what street
performers get a lot of their movement from," Jeebs says. "I thought adding the
silent clowns to the outdoor festival would be nice."

The films will feature the silver-screen antics of Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy and
Buster Keaton. Admission is pay what you can.

The festival is also inviting budding jugglers and plate twirlers to Be Your Own
Busker. The ATB Big Tent program offers novices a chance to learn the street
performers' art from the pros. Kids' World is also back this year and the new
Chalk With the Chalk Chics program brings art to the street, literally.

Visitors to the square can join them daily in a real community art project.

"It's an investment in our audience, and an investment in a different way of
participating in the street festival," says Switzer, who's been running the show
for six years and became a festival volunteer in 1989.

The success of last year's temporary relocation to Old Strathcona didn't
persuade the board that the move should be permanent.

"Last year (it) was our only alternative space. It really worked for our
audiences and our artists. Coming back downtown, we get to say hello to folks
that we missed last year, and I think we're going to have a new audience join us
from the south side too that saw us last year, maybe even for the first time."

A tradition of the festival has been its Comedy Cares program. This year the
buskers will take their acts off the streets and into the Cross Cancer
Institute, Stollery Children's Hospital and WestView Health Centre in Stony
Plain.

Also returning are the two traditional indoor shows Women in Comedy this
Saturday at 9 in the Stanley A. Milner Library theatre, and Late Night Madness
at 10 p.m. on July 15 and 16, also in the Library theatre. For ticket
information on those events, call 425-5162.

The climax of Wednesday's launch saw Mayor Stephen Mandel catapult a cabbage
onto a spiked helmet donned by Toronto comedian Mike Wood, who stood awaiting
the flying vegetable in the plaza's wading pool. The spirit of improvised
silliness is back.

Thanks to Graf, Agassi rackets stay in the family

LENGTH: 1424 words


Andre Agassi almost lost a grip on two special rackets at a benefit auction
before his wife, Steffi Graf, bought them for $360,000.

In the live auction before Agassi's 11th Grand Slam for Children on Saturday at
the MGM Grand Garden Arena, the tennis star was almost ready to donate the
racket with which he won his first professional match, and the racket he used in
his final U.S. Open just weeks ago.

Bidding topped $320,000 before Graf, one of the most celebrated players in
women's tennis, intervened.

``Those rackets are supposed to stay with us,'' she said after making the final
bid.

Agassi offered the next highest bidder a free tennis lesson.

``It's all crazy money, so thank you,'' he said from the stage.

In all, $8.6 million was raised at the benefit for underprivileged, abused and
at-risk children in Las Vegas, Agassi's hometown. Agassi called it ``an amazing
night in an amazing year.''

The evening's host, Ellen DeGeneres, thanked those in attendance for giving
money to Agassi's cause ``when most people in Las Vegas give hundreds and
hundreds of dollars to the Wheel of Fortune and Roulette Foundation.''

`The Departed' arrives at No. 1

Martin Scorsese's mob saga ``The Departed'' debuted as the weekend's top movie
with $27 million, muscling out the horror prequel ``The Texas Chainsaw Massacre:
The Beginning.''

It was a record opening for Scorsese, whose previous best was $10.3 million with
1991's ``Cape Fear.'' Scorsese's films usually debut in narrower release and
gradually roll out to more theaters, but Warner Bros. decided to launch ``The
Departed'' in wide release of 3,017 cinemas.

``I think the cast was the deciding factor and the playability of the movie,''
Warner distribution chief Dan Fellman said of the film, which stars Leonardo
DiCaprio, Matt Damon and Jack Nicholson in a blood-soaked epic about moles
infiltrating the Boston police and a crime gang.

``We had a special film here. We had the cast to drive it that way, and it
worked out well,'' Fellman said.

New Line Cinema's ``Texas Chainsaw Massacre'' prequel, examining the roots of
maniac killer Leatherface and his cannibalistic family, pulled in $19.15 million
in its first weekend. The movie had a $16 million production budget.

The previous weekend's top film, Sony's animated comedy ``Open Season,'' fell to
No. 3 with $16 million, raising its 10-day total to $44.1 million, according to
studio estimates Sunday.

The weekend's other new wide release, Lionsgate's workplace comedy ``Employee of
the Month'' with Jessica Simpson, Dane Cook and Dax Shepard, debuted in fourth
place with $11.8 million.

The top-12 movies took in $102 million, up 16 percent from the same weekend last
year. Overall movie attendance is up 3 percent over 2005.

Two films debuted strongly in limited release. New Line's suburban drama
``Little Children'' opened with $108,400 in five New York City and Los Angeles
theaters.

Directed by Todd Field (``In the Bedroom''), ``Little Children'' features Kate
Winslet, Jennifer Connelly and Patrick Wilson in a satiric look at the dark
secrets underlying a neighborhood's complacent exterior. The film expands to
nationwide release by early November.

ThinkFilm's sexual romp ``Shortbus,'' directed by John Cameron Mitchell
(``Hedwig and the Angry Inch''), opened with $120,650 at six theaters in five
cities.

The unrated film features a cast of unknowns engaging in real sex as characters
work out their sexual and emotional hang-ups at a bohemian salon in New York
City. ``Shortbus'' expands to 10 more cities this weekend.

``This is what the fall movie season is supposed to be all about, with a
tremendous variety of films and genres,'' said Paul Dergarabedian, president of
box-office tracker Exhibitor Relations.

Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters,
according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final figures will be released Monday.

1. ``The Departed,'' $27 million.

2. ``The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning,'' $19.15 million.

3. ``Open Season,'' $16 million.

4. ``Employee of the Month,'' $11.8 million.

5. ``The Guardian,'' $9.6 million.

6. ``Jackass Number Two,'' $6.4 million.

7. ``School for Scoundrels,'' $3.4 million.

8. ``Gridiron Gang,'' $2.3 million.

9. ``Jet Li's Fearless,'' $2.2 million.

10. ``The Illusionist,'' $1.8 million.

Rapper arrested on weapon charge

Jadakiss was arrested on suspicion of weapon possession after a traffic stop,
the rapper's second arrest on gun charges since 2004, authorities said.

Jadakiss, whose real name is Jason Phillips, was one of four people inside the
car police pulled over Saturday, Detective Sgt. Joseph Pietropaolo said. He said
all four were charged with criminal possession of a weapon because a loaded
handgun was found inside the vehicle.

The Yonkers native, who has put out two solo albums and teamed up with Mariah
Carey on the hit single ``U Make Me Wanna'' and with Jennifer Lopez on her hit
``Jenny From the Block,'' sparked controversy in 2004 with his song ``Why,''
which contained lyrics asking ``Why did Bush knock down the towers?'' He said
later it was a reference to the president's failure to stop terrorism.

In July 2004, he was arrested on marijuana and gun possession charges in North
Carolina. Police said they found less than an ounce of marijuana and two loaded
.45-caliber pistols in his vehicle.

He reached a plea agreement the next year on the North Carolina misdemeanor
charges and paid a $900 fine.

There was no telephone listing for the rapper in Yonkers, and his Web site
listed no contact numbers.

Jolie-Pitt bodyguard in fracas

Paparazzi problems for Brangelina last weekend, as cameras forced the celebrity
couple to cut short a family outing, and one of their security guards roughed up
a British photographer.

On location in Pune, India, to shoot a movie about slain journalist Daniel
Pearl, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie had been holed up at a Le Meridian hotel,
the usual media horde outside their doors.

When the couple tried to leave the hotel Saturday, British photographer Sam
Relph of Barcroft Media attempted to take a shot. Relph told the Hindustan Times
newspaper that a security guard grabbed his neck and verbally abused him when he
refused to put down his camera.

Video of the incident was broadcast on India's CNN-IBN news channel. Two Indian
journalists complained that they, too, were threatened by the same security
guard.

Then, Sunday, the two went on an autorickshaw ride with their 5-year-old son,
Maddox Jolie-Pitt, but were forced to turn back when photographers chased them.

Publicists for the couple have not commented on the incidents -- yet.

Fox stumps for senate candidate

Michael J. Fox headlined a campaign fundraiser for Democratic Senate candidate
Claire McCaskill, but his message was broader than one Senate race.

``Contrary to what (former House Speaker) Tip O'Neil said, politics is not
local,'' Fox told McCaskill supporters Thursday at a restaurant in this St.
Louis suburb. ``What happens here does affect my three girls, my son, my wife
and me, and the 100 million Americans living with a disease that could be helped
by stem cell research.''

The actor, who has Parkinson's disease, is a strong advocate of embryonic stem
cell research. McCaskill has made support for the research a key part of her
campaign to unseat Republican Sen. Jim Talent.

Talent opposes the research as unethical, saying it destroys human embryos.

Missouri voters will consider a ballot initiative in November that would ensure
all federally allowed embryonic stem cell research could occur in Missouri. The
Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research, now the largest donor toward
Parkinson's research outside the federal government, supports the initiative.

Fox, who trembled as he spoke, said the disease has diminished some choices in
his life. But ``if I take time to live with that loss, there's no vacuum. It's
filled with opportunity.''

``I'd love to have a cure, but there's a lot of life in the fight,'' he said.

Book calls Cronkite `difficult'

The New York Post reports that Walter Cronkite's former chef is shopping a book
that portrays the CBS legend as abusive and difficult.

``He's a very difficult man. It's all about Walter,'' Terri Schwab, who worked
at Cronkite's Martha's Vineyard home for nine summers, told Page Six. ``It
always was, it always will be. It's dinner for four at 6:30, then it turns into
dinner for six, then dinner for eight. `Yes sir, yes sir, yes sir,' that's the
answer.''

To which one wonders, isn't that sort of what a private chef is supposed to do?

After loss, Racquet Club mens team members will take a break

BYLINE: NANCY MORGAN

SECTION: NEIGHBORHOOD TIMES; TENNIS; Pg. 22

LENGTH: 384 words



Marshall Craig, captain of the men's 3.5 team from the Racquet Club of St.
Petersburg, knows a good team is headed to next month's U.S. Tennis  Association
Adult League regional playoffs at Longboat Key.

Unfortunately, it's not the Racquet Club team.

Instead, East Lake Woodlands, a 4-1 winner in the determining match Sunday  at
the Racquet Club, advances to the regional July 26-28 along with nine other
area teams.

"Our match was quite exciting even though we lost," Craig said. "We had  a
spectacular season and now I think many of us are going to take a tennis
break."

Against East Lake Woodlands, Bill Young and Bob Barlow completed an  unbeaten
season at No. 1 for the Racquet Club. Teammates Lee Baynard and Dave  Farnsworth
in No. 2, and Nick Routh and Newton Rogers in No. 3 lost.

With East Lake leading 2-1 and both singles matches heading into a third  set,
rain caused a delay. The team match moved to the Renaissance Vinoy for  the two
deciding singles matches.

Racquet Club's Pete Gairing was down 5-6 in the final set at No. 1, and  Jack
Weldon was down 3-5 in the third at No. 2. Both rebounded to reach a
tiebreaker, but each lost almost simultaneously.

"The score could easily have been 3-2 for us," said Craig, "but,  definitely, a
good team will represent us at the regionals."

FINAL LEAGUE UPDATE: Countryside Country Club defeated East Lake 4-1 last
weekend to win the women's 3.5 district championship.

JUNIORS AT STATE: Kelly McCain of Largo reached the semifinals of the girls  14
division in last week's state-sanctioned singles tournament in Lauderhill.  The
second-seeded McCain finished third in the 48-player draw.

Pinellas quarterfinalists included Kelly Nelson (girls 12), Lori Grey  (girls
16), Christa Grey (girls 18), Reinaldo Valor and Michael Murray (boys  14) and
Adrian Pagani (boys 18).

Pagani reached the boys 18 consolation final and Joel Berman reached the  boys
16, but rain canceled the event.

FAMILY HOSTS WANTED: Tennis professional Krishnan Anandan of Clearwater is
seeking families willing to host youths from Spain and France next month. The
youths will participate in English classes, tennis, golf and other activities
for three or four weeks. Anyone interested should call Anandan at 462-6144.

A Wave of Innovation Is Turning Rackets Into Data Centers

BYLINE: By STUART MILLER

SECTION: Section B; Column 0; Sports Desk; Pg. 15

LENGTH: 968 words


When Paolo Palmero plays tennis, he knows his racket can improve his game, not
by adding power and spin but by measuring them.

Palmero was among 50 applicants chosen this fall to test the new Babolat Play
Pure Drive rackets with sensors that measure power and spin as well as the
contact point with the ball. Players can download the data to smartphones or
computers using Bluetooth or a USB port.

''It has given me a hard look at my game,'' said Palmero, 40, who lives in
Manhattan and works at the United Nations. ''It's a reality check.''

The Babolat Play, which sells for $399, is the latest in a wave of racket
innovation. Modest adjustments have been common in the past to increase sales of
new models, but this year, more significant innovations have been made. Head
introduced a material, graphene, meant to generate more power, and Wilson and
Prince changed their stringing patterns drastically to generate more spin.

''The tennis market is changing,'' said Roger Petersman, Head's United States
product business manager. ''It's becoming more competitive, and consumers are
smarter, so you need something new to grab their attention.''

This month, the company introduced the $399 Head Custom Made, which allows
consumers to select length, weight, balance, grip shape and material, and string
pattern for their rackets. Each one will be customized in Head's Austrian lab.

''We know what the economy has done to retail,'' Petersman said. ''People need a
reason to change rackets. This is for people who want the best, are very
particular and are not afraid to spend money.''

Eric Babolat, the president and chief executive of Babolat, said his company's
high-tech racket, 10 years in the making, went beyond individualization.

''This is not a new page, it is a new book,'' Babolat said, likening it to the
way sound changed movies and predicting that all rackets would eventually be
connected.

A new International Tennis Federation rule will allow the Babolat racket to be
used during tournament play but will prohibit players from looking at the data
during matches.

Babolat acknowledged the racket's weaknesses, including its difficulty in
discerning a first serve from a second serve. The racket's timing mechanism and
algorithms will eventually be adjusted, he said, and early adopters will be able
to upgrade the app without buying a new one.

''Until now, players have had no concrete information about their game,''
Babolat said. ''Type and number of strokes, spin level, ball impact location,
total and effective play time, power, endurance, technique, consistency, energy,
rallies -- all of this is brand-new information that has never before been
available to players. Babolat Play allows players to essentially take a picture
of their game, and understand how and where they can make key improvements.''

Testing revealed that players loved comparing measurements like power levels,
Babolat said. The data allow comparisons among Babolat Play owners worldwide,
and he said he expected that to be popular with younger players who gravitate
toward using technology for social interaction.

Although Fo Tien was among the Babolat racket testers, he said he did not feel
he was ushering in a revolution.

''It's more of a novelty for me,'' said Tien, 43, who works in finance and lives
in Diamond Bar, Calif. He was shocked to find that his hardest shots registered
in the 50s on the scale Babolat established. Rafael Nadal, by comparison, hits
in the 90s.

''But most of the data is confirming what I already knew,'' he said, adding that
he found the community aspects ''hokey.''

''I already know I hit my shots on the upper part of the hoop so the ball stays
on the string bed a split second longer,'' he said.

Tien is a 4.0-to-4.5 player on the United States Tennis Association's
self-rating scale from 1.5 to 7.0. He said that the new Babolat racket could be
good for beginners and for teaching professionals, but that it would be more
helpful for his game if the information was broken down shot by shot. ''This is
still the first generation,'' he said. ''There's a lot of opportunity there.''

Palmero, a 3.5 player, said the Babolat racket was improving his game. The
numbers provide reminders of his flaws and motivation to break his bad habits.

''I'm not as fast as I used to be, so when I run around my backhand, I'm hitting
more defensive forehands,'' he said. ''I'm also finding I hit more topspin on my
backhand in practice, then I revert to slices during matches.''

Goran Draskovic, 36, a software consultant in Orlando, Fla., said the racket was
an effective coach and ''a game changer.''

Although he is a 4.5 player, Draskovic said he discovered that he hit more shots
near the top of the racket and on the sides than he had thought.

''I had no clue I'm that bad,'' he said. ''It's helping me because I'm reducing
the percentage of off-center shots.''

Lavie Sak, a teaching pro with an engineering background, said tennis was
starved for such data, but he was moving in a different direction. This year,
Sak and Sergey Feingold founded Shot Stats to design a device to provide instant
feedback on racket head speed and a shot's rotations per minute. It will be
small enough to attach to the strings like a vibration dampener, and they hope
to make it available next summer.

''It will be more accurate than the Babolat Play because it is closer to the
contact point, and you will get instant data,'' Sak said.

Such a device appealed to Tien because it could measure his play with different
rackets or the effect of adjustments to his racket.

But Tien said much of what happened with the racket depended on the quality of a
player's footwork, so he suggested one more gadget: ''Someone should invent a
sneaker with an electronic impulse center that gives you shocks to keep you on
your toes and moving your feet.''

2 Adult League teams reach state

BYLINE: NANCY MORGAN

SECTION: NEIGHBORHOOD TIMES; TENNIS; Pg. 14

LENGTH: 825 words



Two local men's teams are a step closer to national competition.

Last month, eight local teams competed in Longboat Key in the three-day USA
Adult League West Regional Championships, with two returning as champions and
three finishing second.

Regional champions included the Racquet Club of St. Petersburg's 3.5 team and
the Bardmoor Golf and Tennis Club's 4.0 squad. Finishing as runners-up were the
Racquet Club's 4.5 men's team, Feather Sound Country Club's 3.0 women's team,
and the Renaissance Vinoy's 3.5 women's team.

The women's 4.5 squad from McMullen in Clearwater was third, as was the men's
5.0 squad based at the Treasure Island Golf, Tennis and Recreation Center.
Treasure Island Tennis and Yacht Club's 4.0 women's team placed fourth.

The Racquet Club 3.5 men helped themselves by defeating two-time regional
champion Hunter's Green 4-1 on the play of Mike Williams and John McQuillen in
singles, Scott Stewart and Scott Johnston in No. 1 doubles, and Jack Weldon and
Earl Gehant in No. 3 doubles. The Racquet Club also beat Bonita Springs and Fort
Myers 4-1 and was to challenge Sarasota in its final match but a mixup in
playing time forced a default by the Sarasota team.

"This was one of the best weekends of tennis," said Bob Dickerson, captain of
the Racquet Club squad. "We knew Hunter's Green in Tampa would be our toughest
team and we had kind of a lucky draw. We played them our first match after they
had already had a match that morning.

"That match (with Hunter's Green) was a close one, as we expected it to be, and
the other two matches were close with stiff competition as well."

This is the first trip to a state tournament for the Racquet Club team, which
also includes Jeff Doty, Neil Voss, Vaughn Haight, Ray Scianci, Steve Uebel, Bob
Wahl and George Ethan Ray, but the second for Bardmoor's 4.0 men's team (the
first was in 1997).

Gene Crouse and John Beda were the most consistent pairing for Bardmoor, scoring
victories in whatever positions they played, said team captain Dan Callahan.
Also, Jeff Sprague and Richard Farci were both 3-1 in singles.

"It seemed someone different stepped up in each match and made the difference
for us," said Callahan. "The championship wasn't wrapped up until nearly the
end."

Rounding out the Bardmoor team are Mike Collins, Doug Godinho, Bill Simmers, Don
Kirby, Tom Byrd, Brad Yerger, Tim Kahle and Matt Fox.

The USA Adult League state tournament is Aug. 13-15 in Altamonte Springs.
Joining the Racquet Club and Bardmoor men's teams will be the Safety Harbor Spa
5.0 women's team, the Feather Sound 3.0 men's team, and possibly two 5.5 men's
teams.

JUNIORS AT NATIONALS: Alexandria Liles reached the quarterfinal round in the
girls 14-and-under division of the USTA National Clay Court Championships and
advanced to the girls 14 doubles final with Anne Yelsey. The duo lost in three
sets in the national final.

Michael Murray reached the round of 32 in the boys 18s while both Reinaldo Valor
and Aleksey Bubis advanced to the round of 16. Bubis then teamed with Brandon
Wagner of Tampa and reached the round of 16 in doubles.

Former St. Petersburg resident Kelly McCain was a finalist in the girls 18s, as
was Wesley Chapel's Sukhwa Young in the boys 14s.

Marc Sawyer and Fred Johnson teamed to win their first national doubles title in
the Midwest Open Championships held last week near Chicago. They defeated a team
from Ohio in straight sets in the boys 14 division.

USA TEAM TENNIS: Pinellas County had nine of the 100 co-ed teams in last
weekend's USTA Florida Section State Championships held in Lakeland. The
south-county league sent five, including four from Lakewood Country Club and one
from the Treasure Island Golf, Tennis and Recreation Center. The north-county
league sent four.

Treasure Island's 12-and-under team finished second in its division, as did the
North Pinellas 1402 team in the 14s. The East Lake Eliminators won the 18s and
the North Pinellas 1402 squad also was named winner of the Sportsmanship Award.
These three teams are now eligible to enter the second annual Georgia Florida
Team Challenge Oct. 2-3 in Jacksonville.

Playing for the Treasure Island team were Michael Kopelman, Chad Fuss, Jason
O'Hara, Alexia Lavely, Kaitlin Holdstein and Amber Maggio. Phil Girardi was the
team coach.

SINGLES WINNERS: Joan Simmons of St. Petersburg and Ed Jagger of Seminole
outplayed their singles competition in last month's state-sanctioned Adult
Tournament at the Pro Star Tennis Club in Clearwater. Simmons won the women's
30-and-over title and Jagger won the men's 30s. Joy Ackerman of Pinellas Park
was a finalist in the women's 30s but retired in the third set. Tara Goedjen of
Oldsmar reached the women's open final.

The next area adult age-division tournament is Aug. 14-16 at Royal Racquet Club
in Clearwater. Singles and doubles, as well as husband-wife age divisions, are
offered. Call Donna Weiss at 791-8415.

Company introduces another way to string a racket

BYLINE: NANCY MORGAN

SECTION: CLEARWATER TIMES; youth sports; Pg. 4

LENGTH: 1083 words

DATELINE: CLEARWATER



CLEARWATER - When it comes to stringing a tennis racket, players    rely on
qualified and experienced stringers. But who do the racquet    stringers rely
on?

      Sporting goods manufacturers spend many hours and dollars in
researching, developing, refining, testing and promoting their findings    about
racket stringing.

      Babolat, a sports manufacturing company based in Lyons, France,
introduced an electronically-controlled stringing machine called Star    II in
February and Frenchman Nicolas Forien is traveling in the United    States
promoting the machine, priced at about $ 1,800.

      Forien was at Advantage Yours Tennis Shoppe in Clearwater Thursday    and
demonstrated Star II to local stringers.

      "We are trying to hit the key tennis markets with Star II,"    Forien
said. "I've been to Texas, California and New York. We have    found that once
we get a shop to switch to Star II, they eventually    replace all their
machines."

      According to Forien, Star II differs from other machines in three    major
ways: a more constant and overall exact string tension, a more    efficient
clamping system that prevents slippage and distortion, and    consolidation of
operation. These differences are basically the result    of having a single
circuit board responsible for the operation of the    entire machine.

      To the racket stringer, these differences should allow a more    overall
constant pull tensioning for accuracy and particular ease in    servicing.

      For the player, the electronically-operated machine should result    in a
more exact tension that creates a better feel on the racket and    overall
constant tension.

      "About 80 percent of the professionals use Babolat string,"    Forien
said. "We have tested the Star II at some of the major    tournaments this year
and the pros seem to be pleased. They may bring    in 10 rackets to string at
the same tension and they can feel any    slight difference in tension."

      Isabelle Torbert and Sandy Ellison, nationally certified racket
stringers employed at Advantage Yours, were skeptical yet, at the same    time,
impressed by Babolat's Star II.

      "As a stringer, I would have to change some habits to use Star    II,"
Torbert said. "There's a sense of comfort and confidence    involved in
stringing and there are some overall differences between    this machine and
what we have been using. Also, since Star II has been    on the market less than
a year, it hasn't really been tested -    longevity is a consideration."

      Ellison sees Star II as particularly advantageous to the    professional
but perhaps not as much to the normal club player.

      "I don't know how many of us as players can tell the difference    in a
little variance in tension," Ellison said. "In stringing with    Star II the
first time, I felt like all thumbs, so you would have to    get used to a
different technique.

      However, if Star II is used to string world-class players and they    are
satisfied, I would say that's the most valid test of all."



     Men's MABL league: Feather Sound Country Club defended its MABL    title in
the men's Clay Court Clubs of Pinellas. Last month, five    clubs, each
represented by four doubles' teams, competed in an    end-of-the season MABL
round robin at Feather Sound. Three teams from    Countryside (Mike Vitale and
Dick Nicholson at No. 1, Bob Nagli and    Dave Anderson at No. 2, and Jeff
Housman and Richard Sola at No. 4) and    one from Feather Sound (Russ Hyden and
Tom Riley at No. 3) were the    winners.

      Winners in the A Division round robin were Scott Zaccaria and    Terry
O'Grady from Treasure Island (No. 1) and Seminole Lake Racquet    Club's teams
of Dana Papolardo and Ron Townsend (No. 2), Kevin Quay and    Tommy Mullins (No.
3) and Leon Richard and Dwight Moore (No. 4).



     Juniors at Lansbrook: Jenny Graf of Clearwater did not lose any    games on
her way to the girls 16 title in the Clay Court Championships    at Lansbrook
Tennis Club in Palm Harbor last weekend. Other local    champions in the
51-player event were Gerald Casas from Clearwater    (boys 10), Ricky Blake from
Palm Harbor (boys 12) and Helen Yotseff    from Seminole (girls 14).



     Buick mixed doubles: Nora Rorabaugh and Rich Costin won the Buick
Amateur Mixed Doubles Tournament in Dunedin last weekend among eight    teams.
In the final, Rorabaugh and Costin defeated Dorothy Carson and    Dick Howarth
6-2,6-1.

      The Dunedin winners advance to sectional competition at one of 128    6
sites with the possibility of reaching the Buick World Championships in
Dallas, Texas, next spring.

      Largo hosts a Buick Mixed Doubles Tournament July 2-3 at Bayhead
Complex. Call 587-6721.

Territo and Dick Durstein.

      In Largo, Gerry Miller was first, followed by Joe Maloney and Mike
Paul. For the women, Erika Boardman placed first; Lynn Hesse, second;

 and Mary Lacey, third.

Today's rackets built to serve pros' games;
Technology gives players options galore

BYLINE: Douglas Robson, Special for USA TODAY

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 8C

LENGTH: 819 words


The days when consumers thought  they were buying the same racket off the shelf
as top pros are long gone.

At that level of the game, players work in close tandem with manufacturers to
finely tune their weapon of choice to cope with today's athleticism, power and
speed.

Here's how one company, Prince, takes clients such as Vera Zvonareva, John Isner
and doubles team Mike and Bob Bryan  through the customization process.

If starting from square one, it can take three to four days, according to Ken
Merritt, one of Prince's player development gurus. A 27-year veteran of the
industry, Merritt travels the globe helping players find the right stick. He
calls himself a racket "technologist."

Merritt explains that today's pros have the wherewithal for any number of
specifications, which means the process can be  exacting and exasperating.

The leap in technology since the early days of composite materials and larger
racket heads is staggering.

"We have some really talented engineers pushing the envelope," Merritt says.

Pros can mix and match from a smorgasbord of options ranging from a racket's
weight, thickness, balance, length, head size and string holes. That doesn't
include grips, string type and string pattern, which opens another can of
variables.

Merritt starts off by scrutinizing a player in action. He monitors the speed,
spin, height, direction and depth of shots.

Next, he tests the player's existing frame using a gizmo for three key
measurements: static weight, when the frame is resting; balance, or the center
point; and finally the dynamic weight, or how heavy the racket "feels" as it
moves through the air.

The last factor is measured by hooking the racket up to the machine, which
swings it back and forth and punches out a number.

A pro player typically uses the same basic frame a consumer buys but adjusted --
in most cases with weight added to the head or handle, and often both. That's
because the pros are doing things that demand specialized needs and far exceed
the weekend warrior's capabilities.

Prince also employs high-speed, high-definition video. The company uses
technology from software company Dartfish to track the stability of the swing
and ball characteristics of all of its top players.

To be sure, New Jersey-based Prince is not alone when it comes to racket
customization. Most of the big manufacturers, from Wilson to Head to Babolat,
have similar programs for pros and top-ranked junior players.

"Pro players are always looking for that little edge," says Ron Rocchi, Wilson's
principal  designer, who says the Chicago-based company customizes rackets for
about 125 players. "It's our responsibility to put in front of them the latest
performance-enhancing advantages that might be out there."

Men, on the whole, tend to be fussier than women when it comes to figuring out
the exact specifications.

However, it is  dangerous to generalize, and some men, such as longtime Prince
player David Ferrer, have used the same model for years or made  few
modifications once they settle on a frame.

"I don't like to change, because you know the racket is very personal for the
players," says the fifth-ranked Spaniard, who notes a small change can cause a
player to alter his swing, which could lead to injuries.

Most try to keep an open mind and check out new innovations or improvements to
frames in November and December, when the tour takes a short break.

"Each offseason, no matter how I feel, I will try something different," says No.
6 Russian Zvonareva, who switched to a frame with the EX03 technology two years
ago but also added a few grams of weight to the frame and head.

"Each player is different," she adds. "For some, if they like something, they
stick to it forever. For me, I'm quite open. I'm willing to try different
things. But sometimes I feel like the switch is necessary."

Prince places a premium on innovation and building lasting relationships with
its players, according to CEO Gordon Boggis.

"Customization is one part of the bigger picture for Prince," he says.

Some 900-1,000 pros and juniors have been through Prince's Who's Next Academy
Alliance program, in which the company teams up with tennis academies around the
world to help them find the perfect frame.

There are no plans to roll out the program on a consumer level, but Boggis
thinks that if it could be scaled out and made profitable, the demand would be
"off the charts."

For those willing to pay , independent customizers such as RPNY, Bosworth and
Priority One will provide services to the general public.

Merritt says customization boils down to three cardinal rules: "Listen, listen,
and listen."

But he says an open perspective helps.

"The ones that are always looking for something and are easy to deal with tend
to be successful players," Merritt says. "The Bryans are perfect examples. Those
guys have switched rackets three times now because they are trying to break
their own records every week."

AT&T NOTEBOOK Connors racket has old look, modern feel

BYLINE: By Glenn Sheeley STAFF WRITER

SECTION: SPORTS; Section E; Page 2

LENGTH: 458 words


Look, it's a giant licorice lollipop. It's a makeup mirror. No, it's Jimmy
Connors's new racket.

Andre Agassi calls the racket "definitely weird." Connors calls it "absolutely
the fastest racket I've ever played with."

All black with a single throat, the experimental Prince racket Connors
brandishes these days has the appearance of an old wooden Jack Kramer model, but
is super-light, flexible and composed of high-tech materials. Exactly what
materials, Prince isn't saying. But by the time the racket, which Connors has
been playing with this week at the AT&T Challenge, goes on the market this
summer, the 41-year-old lefthander will have fiddled with the specifications to
fit his needs.

"I'm hitting shots now like I used to hit on the run," said Connors Monday night
after his first ATP Tour event win in 14 months. "I'm hitting the ball with less
effort and more power than I ever have."

Prince publicist Todd Woodward said the racket "is going to be popping up in
some interesting people's hands" over the next few months. Providing some
intrigue about the racket, which will probably sell in the $ 200 range, Woodward
said, "No one's saying exactly what it's made of."

FINDING FAULT: Agassi already seems to miss Horseshoe Bend Country Club, where
he won the AT&T Challenge four times. The tournament last year moved to the
Atlanta Athletic Club, but Agassi was unable to play because of a wrist injury.
Playing singles on the AAC clay for the first time Tuesday night, Agassi said he
was "quite disappointed with the lights." Said the almost 24-year-old, "I don't
like the lights here. I don't think that you see the ball as well as you
should."

If it appears to stadium court watchers that things are tight between the back
line and the stands, Agassi thought so, too. On deep topspin-laden shots that
kick high, there's not much room between racket and cocktail glass.

"Everybody's so close," Agassi said, "it's uncomfortable in one sense. Yet, in
another sense, it's quite intimate."

Most players have either said they like the current facility better or expressed
no preference. Michael Chang said, "It's definitely more spread out. It would
seem to be a lot better for the fans."

ATTENDANCE UP: Until Wednesday night's thunderstorms, tournament attendance was
up over last year. Through Wednesday afternoon, 34,341 had attended - 7,561 on
Tuesday night. Chang, on the quality of the field at most ATP events: "Guys are
good enough today that if somebody hits a 125 mph serve against somebody who's
in his zone, people are going to get it back." . . . Connors, who faces No. 5
seed MaliVai Washington in a second- round match today, lost to him at the AT&T
last year 7-6, 6-2. He's 3-0 lifetime against Connors.

Having A Blast On The Court;
After Winning Middle States Titles, Local Teams To Compete In Nationals.

BYLINE: Kelly Smedley

SECTION: C; Pg. 6

LENGTH: 574  words

DATELINE: Lancaster, PA


Recreational tennis is hot in Lancaster County, particularly among those who
have been swinging a racket for more than 20 years.

The proof lies in the fact that three local club adult teams will compete this
fall in the United States Tennis Association National Championships. The average
age of the players from the local clubs hovers in the mid-to-late 40s. They will
be competing against players as young as 18.

"It's really weird. We could be their mothers,'' said Jenni Grove, who was a
standout tennis player at both Ephrata High School and the University of
Maryland. "I have been playing for 41 years.''

Grove, who plays for both the 5.0 women's and 10.0 mixed teams at Racquet Club
West in East Hempfield Township, will travel to Palm Springs, Calif., this week
to compete in both singles and doubles play. Unfortunately, she will miss her
induction into the Ephrata High School Sports Hall of Fame.

Grove's doubles partner is Ann Clark, who played for both Elizabethtown High
School and Elizabethtown College. Clark, who is the assistant girls' tennis
coach at Hempfield High School, said they have a pretty good chance of winning
the 5.0 doubles championship.

"I think we can beat almost anyone in doubles," Clark said. "We're old, but we
have played for a long time together."

Clark said this is the fifth time she has gone to nationals in the last 10
years. She attributes the team's success to the team's longevity coupled with
the sport's popularity in Lancaster County.

"There are more than 90 teams at Hempfield [Rec Center],'' she said. "It's
really big around here. There is good tennis in Lancaster.''

There are 184 USTA leagues in the Lancaster area playing out of Hempfield, Bent
Creek, Racquet Club West and Lancaster Tennis & Yacht Club.

There are 56 Adult leagues, 32 Senior, 14 Super Senior, 10 Tri Levl, 32 Mixed,
16 Senior Mixed and 24 Central Penn Ladies.

For the Central Pennsylvania region, there are 340 teams and 4,267 players.

To quality for nationals, the local teams won Middle States titles this summer
in tournaments at Princeton, N.J.

Kathy Oostdam, who plays with a local 4.0 club, said this is her first time
competing in nationals as a 4.0 player. Her team will compete in Tucson, Ariz.,
on Oct. 17-21. Oostdam, whose team is comprised of players from Central
Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, New Jersey and Delaware, admits she has a knack for
recruiting quality players.

"Someone told me [Penn State football coach] Bill O'Brien needs me for
recruiting,'' Oostdam joked.

Oostdam said there will be 17 teams competing at the 4.0 championship and she
feels her team has a good chance of making it pretty far in the tournament.

"We are very competitive, but there is no drama,'' Oostdam said. "The key to our
success is we get along. It makes it easier to win.''

Regardless of the results, each team is excited to be sharing the experience
with longtime friends and family.

"Our husbands are going along so we will spend a lot of time hiking, biking and
being with each other,'' Grove said. "We are competitors and friends. It should
be a lot of fun.''

nFour local seniors teams won Middle States titles last weekend at Princeton.
The winning teams:

Lancaster Tennis and Yacht Club's 3.0 senior women, captained by Cheryl
Champion; Hempfield Rec's 3.0 senior men, captained by Maggie Springer;
Hempfield Rec's 3.5 senior men, captained by Ariff Suma; and Lancaster Tennis
and Yacht Club's 4.5 senior men, captained by Mark Trach.

Graff bids $360,000 for 2 of Aggasi's tennis rackets

LENGTH: 100 words


Andre Agassi almost lost a grip on two special rackets at a benefit auction
before his wife, Steffi Graf, bought them for $360,000.

In the live auction before Agassi's 11th Grand Slam for Children on Saturday at
the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, the tennis star was almost ready to
donate the racket with which he won his first professional match, and the racket
he used in his final U.S. Open just weeks ago.

Bidding topped $320,000 before Graf, one of the most celebrated players in
women's tennis, intervened.

"Those rackets are supposed to stay with us," she said after making the final
bid.

Next wave of hi-tech racquets lands

BYLINE: STEPHANIE MYLES, The Gazette

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. C6

LENGTH: 870  words


If you wondered how a tennis racquet company gets retailers to push its
products, the answer can be found in Las Vegas.

Wilson invited 655 merchants from 55 countries to the multi-million-dollar
launch of the new K-Factor line in late February. That's 655 plane tickets, 655
multi-day hotel stays at Caesar's Palace, 655 tickets to the Cirque du Soleil's
Ka show, and 655 tickets to the men's ATP event being played there that week.

Wilson did everything but throw in a few grand in house money for the craps
tables.

The first group of five, including Roger Federer's signature stick, already is
in stores and selling briskly. The rest will be rolled out in the coming weeks.
Federer himself appeared, on a live video hookup from Dubai, expounding on the
virtues of the K Six-One Tour 90, the racquet he helped develop and began using
at the Australian Open.

It worked there; Federer won the first Grand Slam of the year without dropping a
set. It worked in Dubai. It didn't work so well this week in Indian Wells,
Calif., where Federer dropped a straight-set shocker to Guillermo Canas.

After that one, they might start calling him "K-Fed."

The difference in specs between the new weapon and Federer's previous model -
the N Six-One Tour 90 - are minimal. Rumour has it Federer didn't even play with
that one; it was a special hybrid of two older models, painted red and white.
But the new one is apparently quite different. And Federer has legitimately made
the switch.

Jean-Guy Sauve, who manages the Sportivement Votre shop in St. Eustache,
attended the launch and said the retailers were treated like royalty.

In addition to the other activities, they met top-25 players Mardy Fish and
Dmitry Tursunov, who recently signed with Wilson. Fish had long been with
Dunlop. They also spent an afternoon play-testing the new racquets.

The St. Eustache store is Wilson's biggest seller in Canada, according to Sauve.
Its first allotment of 60 K-Factor racquets sold out in a month. Reviews have
been very, very good.

Wilson also has the Williams sisters and Justin Henin in its stable. But the
three haven't yet bought into the K-Factor, at least not officially. Serena and
Venus have been playing with what are supposed to be the new-generation sticks,
but they've been painted black. Henin used her old Wilson N-Code, N-Tour 2 to
win in Dubai and Doha.

Since you asked, the difference between an "N" and a "K" is that instead of one
racquet technology, there are now four. They all start with a K: (K)arophite
Black, (K)onnector, (K)ontour Yoke and (K)ompact Centre. You don't want to know
the details. The fact that the racquet matrix, whatever that is, is "denser and
stronger" probably won't fix your wonky backhand.

But it all sounds pretty high-tech, doesn't it?

Canadian news: While many of the Canadian men, including

finalist Frederic Niemeyer, entered a $10,000 event in Hull last week, Toronto's
Peter Polansky chose a $15,000 tournament in Texas instead.

It was a good call; the unseeded Polansky won the singles, and got to the
doubles final with partner Donald Young.

It was the fourth win on the minor-league Futures level this year for the
18-year-old, and the biggest. He defeated the No. 1, No. 3 and No. 4 seeds,
players ranked up to 200 spots higher than his No. 509, in straight sets.

The victory should boost Polansky's ranking to about 435. He started the year at
No. 821.

Ban the super tiebreak: Canadian Daniel Nestor and his partner Mark Knowles lost
the first set of their first-round doubles match at Indian Wells, but stormed
back to win the second set 6-0 and were on a roll.

Then the new super tiebreak format kicked in (first to 10 points, replacing the
third set) the thinking being that doubles takes up too much time at ATP events.
Czechs Lukas Dlouhy and David Skoch won four points in that second set, only one
on their own serve. Nestor and Knowles won more points overall (66 vs. 57), but
lost basically because their opponents won one more point against serve than
they did in that super tiebreak. Not too fair.

Retired, not dead: Andre Agassi is retired, but he's still playing. He'll travel
to Santiago, Chile to play an exhibition against Marcelo Rios on March 30.

Rios, the brilliantly talented but enigmatic left-handed Chilean who briefly
reached No. 1 in 1998, is only 31; back problems forced him out early.

The two didn't play often on the Tour, which is a shame. You won't find any two
players who strike the ball more purely. And Rios beat Agassi twice and retired
once in their meetings. ...

Monica Seles never officially retired, but she hasn't played an official match
since losing in the first round of the 2003 French Open to Nadia Petrova. She'll
play some exhibitions with Martina Navratilova next month.

Don't play, look good: It seems that you don't have to actually play
professional tennis to get a clothing and shoe endorsement.

Former pro Anna Kournikova has signed to represent K-Swiss. Mostly known for its
shoes, the company has a few professional players wearing its clothes, but
nobody you'd know.

Kournikova, 25, will be featured in TV and print ads. Her actual tennis these
days is limited to exhibitions, charity events and some World Team Tennis.

Treasure Island women's team gets pleasant surprise

BYLINE: NANCY MORGAN

SECTION: NEIGHBORHOOD TIMES; TENNIS; Pg. 18

LENGTH: 746 words



Treasure Island Tennis and Yacht Club clinched the USA League Tennis senior
women's 4.0 district title last weekend. The Racquet Club of St. Petersburg
moved a step closer to the men's 3.5 championship match.

Treasure Island advanced to the national tournament last year, and was forced to
split up members this season.

"Frankly, I was surprised we won this time," TI captain Susan Hobbs said. "I
knew we would have a pretty good team, but still didn't really expect us to win
it."

Hobbs, Ann Worthington and Pat Kelly were members last year. Joining them are
Judy Grim, who has captained national qualifiers; and newcomers Marlene
Mokracek, Jane Lee Cobb, Gisela Leyva and Donna Dicus.

In Treasure Island's final match last weekend, Hobbs and Leyva won in the No. 1
position. Grim and Dicus were victorious at No. 2.

"Part of what has helped with our success has been that we've stayed pretty much
with the same partners throughout the season," Hobbs said. "We all play other
leagues, so we get plenty of practice."

Helping the team to its 9-1 record were the doubles squads of Worthington and
Mokracek and Kelly and Cobb.

The Racquet Club advanced to the men's 3.5 senior playoffs with a first-place
record in the south division. A 3-0 victory in the opening round of the
postseason put the team in the semifinals last weekend with the Phil Green
Tennis Academy from Safety Harbor Spa.

Tony Damouny and Steve Uebel remained unbeaten at No. 1 with a score of 6-3, 7-6
(4). Ray Cianci and Tom Stewart had a three-set victory to clinch the Racquet
Club's win. Rounding out the club's team are Don Campagna, Dave Laesser, Russ
Barlow, Bob Steele, George Routh and Ron Whitaker.

The Treasure Island squad is assured of a state berth  in mid-May. The Racquet
Club will qualify with a victory Saturday.

MORE SENIOR LEAGUE NEWS: Also clinching district titles were Timber Pines Tennis
Club (3.0) and Westin Innisbrook Resort (3.5) among the women and the
Countryside Country Club (3.0) and PGTA (4.5) men. The final round in men's 4.0
this weekend features Seminole Lake Tennis Center hosting McMullen Tennis
Center. The winner takes the division and advances to state. Last weekend,
Seminole defeated the Vinoy 3-0 on the play of Ron Klieve and Mauro Rodriguez,
John Beda and Larry Daum and Tim Kahle and Howard Kligman. McMullen beat East
Lake 3-0.

SUPER SENIORS:  Leaders in the USA League Tennis men's divisions are Shipwatch
Tennis Club (3.5 south) and PGTA (3.5 north). Shipwatch is 3-0, including a 2-1
win over Bardmoor on the play of Henry VanDrunen and Evan Odden and Bill
Nelligar and Rod Rodriguez. PGTA is 5-0 after a 3-0 victory against Innisbrook.

MIXED LEAGUES: With just a few weeks remaining in the USA Tennis Florida mixed
doubles leagues, the PGTA is first among the 8.5 senior teams and Royal Racquet
Club is unbeaten in the 7.5 senior division. In the adult class, McMullen is 9-0
in 8.5. Two Bardmoor teams are challenging for first place in 7.5. With no local
competition, Innisbrook's 6.5 senior squad automatically advances to state.

NET NOTES: Bob Meyerdierks defended his 75-and-over top seed with a straight-set
victory in the Super Seniors Designated Championships at St. Petersburg Tennis
Center. Second-seeded Dave Krebs won the 65 singles title and teamed with Ed
Hamilton to capture the 60 doubles award. Tom Avirett and Don Wray won the 80
doubles crown in the main draw. Leo Poulin and Phillip Bird were tops in the 70
doubles consolation format.

In the SPTC Adult Championships, played the same weekend,Judy Grim won the
women's 55 singles title and Nik Sukhasam the 35 consolation.

+In last week's Suncoast Singles League, St. Petersburg Country Club tied Vinoy
I at 2 and Vinoy II fell 3-1 to East Lake.

+Entering today's action, Shipwatch B has a 10-9 edge on Shipwatch C in the
South Pinellas Ladies Doubles League 3.0-3.5 division. Leading 3.5-4.0 is the
St. Petersburg Country Club Aces with eight points. TI Rec, the Smashers,
Shipwatch A and Vinoy B are tied for second.

Australian Open diary 2013: Hall of Fame honours raft of Aussie legends

BYLINE: Kevin Mitchellguardian.co.uk

LENGTH: 517 words

ABSTRACT

Kevin Mitchell: Rod Laver, John Newcombe and Evonne Goolagong Cawley among
greats inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame

FULL TEXT

Bernard Tomic might not be bothered about playing Davis Cup for Australia, but
there was a time when it mattered more than just about anything else - nearly as
much as beating England at cricket.

A reminder of those days arrived when a raft of great Australian players from
the past were inducted here into the International Tennis Hall of Fame.

They included Frank Sedgman, John Newcombe, Rod Laver, Margaret Smith Court,
Ashley Cooper, Pat Rafter, Ken Rosewall, Tony Roche, Lesley Turner Bowrey, Brian
Tobin, Evonne Goolagong Cawley and Neale Fraser, all of whom were on hand at
Melbourne Park to receive a Hall of Fame ring.

The Hall of Fame chairman, Christopher Clouser, said: "From record-setting grand
slam champions to unstoppable Davis Cup teams, Australia boasts a tennis history
that is among the most dynamic and storied in the world, and it is the goal of
the International Tennis Hall of Fame to preserve and celebrate that history.
These great Australian tennis legends have given so much to our sport over the
years, and we are so pleased to be able to recognise their achievements once
more with this special ring, which only the most successful and influential
individuals in tennis will have the honour of wearing."

Sentimental? Certainly. But then there was a time when sentiment was not a dirty
word.

Lendl eyes on young Murrays

Ivan Lendl, meanwhile, has his eyes on the future. His International Junior
Tennis Academy has announced a fresh intake of the world's most promising young
players this spring.

They are coming from Bulgaria, New Zealand and Russia, as well as Alabama,
Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South
Carolina, South Dakota, Texas and Virginia in the United States.

None from the UK - but then he has his hands full with one player from there in
Andy Murray. And who could deny that Lendl's association with the world No3 has
been anything but brilliant for business?

I'll break my racket if I want to

Goran Ivanisevic, in Melbourne to play in the legends' doubles with Cédric
Pioline, is as entertaining as ever.

"I don't understand the crowd," he said. "They say we need characters - then you
break the racket and they boo you. Everybody gets unhappy. I don't know why
they're unhappy. If I want to break racket, it's my racket, who cares? I change
the racket."

And who were the bat-basher's favourites in his playing days?

"I loved everyone. Actually I didn't like [Jim] Courier. I didn't have a good
record against him, but I like [Andre] Agassi, I liked to play [Boris]

Becker, [Stefan] Edberg.... Actually I hate [Pete] Sampras because he ruined my
life. I lost so many matches.

"I played Sampras 15 times; we never had a rally more than four times and they
talking they changed the rules because of me? I don't think so. That era you
have Boris Becker, you have [Michael] Stich, [Richard] Krajicek, you have
Sampras, you have me ... and the courts were bullet-fast."

And his wit remains so.

Clapping, kneeling can help your game

BYLINE: Susan Biddle Jaffe

SECTION: NORTH PINELLAS TIMES; Tennis; Pg. 4

LENGTH: 624 words

DATELINE: ST. Petersburg



ST. PETERSBURG - Sadly, none of us have perfect groundstrokes.

     Even the tennis pros with the impressive forehands, backhands and
overheads have coaches who help them maintain and improve their form.

     But even if you don't have a coach, improvement is possible if you    learn
a few simple tricks.

     Remember that improving your tennis game takes time. Concentrate on    the
basics first - make sure your foundation is solid before you try    adding the
trimmings.

     Tired of having your forehand sound more like a dull crack than a    solid
ping because the ball misses the center of your racket? Then    applaud your
forehand.

     Without your racket, stand sideways on the court as if you were    getting
ready to hit a forehand. Spread your arms apart, taking your    racket hand back
as you would normally. Your free hand should be    pointing to where you want
the ball to go. With your free hand still,    pull your racket hand through
until your hands clap. That's the motion    you want each time you hit a
forehand.

     Letting the racket head drive through the ball and catching the    racket
on the followthrough will not only give you a more solid shot,    but will give
you more control by keeping your shoulders from turning    too early.

     Are you begging for a better serve? Then kneel.

     One key to a good serve is hitting the ball with a good arm motion
instead of throwing your entire body into the serve.

     To improve your arm movement, put your racket aside and get down on    your
knees on the court. Bring your serving hand to your ear, keeping    your elbow
at the same height. Then straighten your arm as if shooting    a basketball
layup.

     The motion should be like raising your hand in class and not like
throwing a football. What this does is create a natural arc that will    help
give you a natural followthrough.

     Try hitting a few serves from this position before standing up.

     Once on your feet, put your feet together and try the same motion    with a
racket and ball. If the motion and toss are correct you should    be able to
complete your serve without pulling your feet apart. The    toss should be an
inch or two above your extended racket.

     Step three is to stand with your feet shoulder width apart and    serve.
The driving forward motion you see with better players is the    result of the
momentum of the racket tip moving through the ball. That    followthrough should
come only as an afterthought.





   The fifth annual Shade Sunscreen/Raymond James & Associates Tennis
Tournament will be held April 11-12 at the Treasure Island Tennis and    Yacht
Club. Entry fee for the doubles tournament is $ 35 per person per    event and
includes a barbecue dinner and dance April 11. The entry    deadline is April 4.

 Entry forms are available at area tennis shops and    through the American
Cancer Society.

     Eckerd Open officials still need volunteers, host families, drivers    and
a daytime volunteer coordinator to help with this year's    tournament. For more
information or to sign up, call the Eckerd Open    office at 391-9964.

     Adults interested in league play can sign up at Largo's Bayhead    Complex
for matches beginning in April. Divisions for men and women at    all levels of
play are available. For more information or to learn of    other Largo parks and
recreation department tennis programs, call Mary    at 584-8671, ext. 228.

Wesleyan's Fisher adjusts to role on another court

BYLINE: RON POWELL, Lincoln Journal Star

SECTION: C; Pg. 3

LENGTH: 603 words

DATELINE: Lincoln, NE


Two-year starter in basketball back in the swing at No. 1 for Wolves' tennis
team

Like father, like daughter.

Kylie Fisher's father, Roger, played tennis and basketball at Kearney State and
later was a teaching pro at the Lincoln Racquet Club.

After two years as a 5-foot-9 starting guard on the Nebraska Wesleyan women's
basketball team, Kylie is now on the tennis court playing No. 1 singles for the
Prairie Wolves' women's squad this spring.

Ironically, the former Lincoln Southeast state doubles champion renewed her
interest in tennis after taking a part-time pro position at the Lincoln Racquet
Club last summer.

"I started playing a little out there (at the Racquet Club), and it was fun,"
Fisher said. "I knew then I wouldn't be playing basketball this season, but I
didn't want to be sitting around doing nothing. I've played tennis all my life,
so I might as well play it in college like my dad did."

Fisher didn't touch a racquet for two years after high school. Even at
Southeast, tennis was secondary to basketball. The only tennis she played was
during the spring high school season. In the summer, her focus immediately
shifted to basketball.

As a Knight, Fisher was a three-time Class A state doubles champion with partner
Dana Tegt, winning a No. 2 title in 1999 and then No. 1 gold medals in 2000 and
'01. Prior to this tennis season, you could count on one hand how many singles
matches Fisher had played since she was 14.

"All of my doubles is played at the net, and that's why singles has been so
different for me because of all the groundstrokes from the baseline," Fisher
said. "My (ground) strokes were pretty shaky at first, but I'm doing much better
now."

She's also adjusting to the high level of competition that No. 1 singles brings.
Often at NAIA and NCAA Division III schools, the No. 1 player is far superior to
everyone else on the team. They can be top foreign players or former Division I
college players who have transferred.

Fisher's singles record is 4-11, but four of those losses have been in three
sets and another was 7-5, 7-5. Fisher owns a 9-6 record in doubles, including a
5-1 mark at No. 1 with Lauren Pfister, a former Class B No. 1 doubles champion
at Lexington.

In her first tournament last fall in Kansas City, Fisher had to face one of the
top nationally-ranked NAIA players in her first match, followed by one of the
top junior college players in America in her second.

"At that point, I was thinking, 'What have I gotten myself into?' " Fisher said.
"Playing No. 1 singles, you get everything thrown at you. It's challenging, and
that part is hard because I don't like losing."

Wesleyan coach Rick Harley has been impressed with Fisher's athletic ability. He
says the victories will come as she gains more experience.

"It's amazing what she's been able to do after not playing a (tennis) match in
over two years," said Harley, whose women's team is 5-10 overall this spring and
2-2 in Great Plains Athletic Conference play. Six of those losses have been by
5-4 scores.

"This year, it's been a matter of getting her feet on the ground and accustomed
to college tennis. Next year she'll be winning those three-set matches."

NWU's No. 1 singles player, senior Andy Huls, moved a step closer to a possible
GPAC title. The former Class B state champion from Waverly defeated last year's
GPAC player of the year, Jesse Young of Sioux Falls, in three sets Saturday.

Huls, the all-time win leader in NWU history, is 9-12 overall this spring, but
4-0 in conference play. As a team, the Prairie Wolves are 8-13 overall and 3-1
in the GPAC.

Squash Rackets: Growing interest opens the way for a second division

BYLINE: COLIN MCQUILLAN

SECTION: Issue 62708.

LENGTH: 645 words


For the second successive year the American Express Premier League produced a
tense conclusion. This week Poundstretcher Dunnings Mill fought to the last
rubber of the season to win on countback from Skol Leicester, finishing level on
94 points but ahead on match victories.

'When we started out in the 1984-85 season, there was a serious concern that a
national league would lack the commitment and involvement that squash develops
on a local level,' said Andrew Shelley, competitions manager for the Squash
Rackets Association. 'In fact interest has grown so much in the American Express
League that we are now forced to consider a second division. '


The desirability for a national league was evident some years prior to the Amex
initiative. An enormous competitive base grew throughout the country during the
1970 boom years and some 50,000 players now compete weekly in inter-club county
leagues in Britain.

It was no mere coincidence that Philip Kenyon and Kelvin Smith, the leading
players for the new league champions, dangerously delayed their departures this
week to the Spanish Open, a Grand Prix tournament carrying ranking points, in
order to help Dunnings Mill to a 5-0 victory over Nottingham.

In similar vein Ross Norman, the world champion, scurried straight from the
European Open final in Munich to support the unsuccessful attempt of InterCity
Cannons to beat Manchester Northern into third place. Stuart Davenport, the
world No. 3, stayed to lead Skol Leicester to a 5-0 victory over Ardleigh Hall
that would have won the title had Poundstretchers faltered in just one rubber.

Kenyon and company now earn significant incomes from the national league,
playing top class competition in front of partisan club crowds of a few hundreds
each week of the season. With national media and local television willing to
recognize and report it, the Amex League provides the legitimate sporting
profile its three million adherents have long insisted it deserves over other
so-called minority games.

No other country boasts such a competition. Only Jahangir Khan and the other top
Pakistanis are missing from the 100 international players and local men
contracted to national league squads. There are strong rumours that one London
club is angling to buy its way into the league with a team headed by Jahangir,
who is known to demand at least pounds 1,000 an appearance.

There is, in fact, quite a queue of wealthy and enterprising clubs anxious to
join what is now established as a successful league. There are also a number of
grumbles within the league about the expense of maintaining full professional
squads and transporting them throughout the country, not to mention to
international tournaments.

Sponsorship is a basic component of the competition, which leads to many teams
running under unwiedly titles. Leicester, for instance, run under the official
banner of Central Skol Oadby this season, while Poundestretcher Dunnings Mill,
of East Grinstead, are another mouthful.

Marcos one break from forfeit

BYLINE: Jon Ralph

SECTION: SPORT; Pg. 98

LENGTH: 329  words


IMAGINE the extreme case - Marcos Baghdatis forced to quit the Australian Open
because he ran out of racquets.

But that had been a distinct possibility, he revealed, after a dummy spit in
which he shredded four in 25 seconds and was down to his last racquet.

He was yesterday fined $800 by the Grand Slam committee for racquet abuse, small
change for a player boasting $4.6 million in prizemoney.

But he told tournament manager Craig Tiley after Wednesday night's match that he
had only one more racquet remaining after the remarkable outburst.

Joel Disbro, the tour stringing manager, said if Baghdatis had run out of
racquets he might have been forced out.

``The big players take six to eight racquets on court with them. I would image
he would have to default if he ran out of racquets,'' he said.

A wave of players yesterday weighed in with support for Baghdatis, who lost in
straight sets to Swiss player Stan Wawrinka.

Five-time Australian Open champion Serena Williams was impressed with his feat.

``I've never done that. That's impressive, wow,'' she said.

``I actually used to break a lot of racquets on the court. I sometimes break
them in practice, just not in a match any more,'' she said.

Joseph Sobek, the Inventor Of Racquetball, Dies at 79

BYLINE: By FRANK LITSKY

SECTION: Section B; Page 11; Column 1; Sports Desk

LENGTH: 788 words


Almost a half-century ago, Joe Sobek, frustrated that he could not find an
indoor racquet sport he liked, designed a new racquet, found a ball of the right
size and spring, and invented racquetball. Last Friday, he died at Greenwich
Hospital in Connecticut at age 79.

The cause was congestive heart failure, said his wife, the former Nancy
Erlichman.

According to Luke St. Onge, the executive director of the United States
Racquetball Association and secretary general of the International Racquetball
Federation, the sport Mr. Sobek invented now has 7 million players in the United
States, 8.5 million worldwide.

Mr. Sobek was the first person inducted into the Racquetball Hall of Fame. His
sport is played in 91 nations, with a lucrative professional tour in the United
States, Japan, Mexico and Canada. It is part of the quadrennial Pan American
Games, and the international federation is trying to have it added to the 2004
Olympics in Athens.

Joseph George Sobek was born April 5, 1918, in Greenwich and was raised there.
Until he retired in 1985, he had spent most of his life as a tennis and squash
racquets professional at the Greenwich Country Club; the Westchester Country
Club in Rye, N.Y., and the Fairview Country Club in Greenwich.

But it was an office job at a rubber manufacturing plant in Bridgeport, Conn.,
that led to the start of racquetball in 1950.

"For me," Mr. Sobek once said, "suddenly not to exercise regularly, sitting on
my fanny all day and watching my waistline spread was very hard to take."

He was such a good squash racquets player that he had trouble finding opponents.
He rejected handball as "too strenuous and too hard on the hands." He spurned
paddle ball as too slow. Then an idea struck, a variation of paddle ball.

Legend has it that he sawed off part of the handle of a tennis racquet. In
truth, he started with a platform-tennis paddle altered with strings. Then,
after many experiments, he found that the core of a tennis ball produced a
rubber ball smaller, softer and not as lively as a handball. Racquetball was
born.

To promote his invention, Mr. Sobek took it on the road. He founded the Paddle
Rackets Association, but he never played in a tournament. Y.M.C.A.'s, which
housed most of the nation's handball courts, would not allow professional
athletes to take part, and he had been a tennis professional on and off since
1937.

In 1968, a group of racquetball players formed an association and asked Robert
Kendler, the president of the United States Handball Association, to promote the
sport. In 1969, the new group held a national championship. Within a year, Mr.
Kendler had taken over the sport.

Mr. Sobek was out of the picture and went back to work as a tennis professional.
He insisted that he was pleased. As he told Tom Carlson for a 1979 article in
Racquetball: "I decided that things had grown beyond me and my Paddle Rackets
Association, and so I willingly let the big boys take over."

For a 1993 article in Racquetball Magazine, another publication, Sobek told Tom
Slear:

"Kendler had both the money and a proven record in handball. I was old enough to
know what happened to squash tennis. It was a good sport, but it never had a
chance because of opposing organizations. I'm just proud that something I
started has become a multimillion-dollar sport played around the world."

Those multimillions never reached Mr. Sobek. As Mr. Slear wrote:

"All those volunteer hours he spent with engineers at rubber companies designing
a suitable ball, all those late nights packaging racquets, balls and rule books
before mailing them to interested parties throughout the country. Make money?
Hell, he lost plenty and never gave a thought to making any of it back."

Mr. Sobek is survived by his wife; a son, Joseph Jr. of Irvine, Calif., from a
previous marriage; a brother, Edward of Conyers, Ga.; two sisters, Florence
Coppola of Greenwich and Barbara DiNardo of Somers, N.Y.; four stepchildren,
Peter Schuyten of Princeton, N.J.; Candace Smith of Williamsburg, Va.; Katherine
Sebestyen of Melbourne, Australia, and Vicky Suscaldo of New Canaan, Conn., and
seven grandchildren.

For Mr. Sobek, the satisfaction of invention was enough. "A sport I began for a
few friends at the Greenwich Y.M.C.A. is now played by millions of people all
over the world," he once said. "It's truly astonishing."

His sport burns almost 800 calories an hour. Power and strength are not
required, making it especially attractive to women and older men.

In addition, he said: "When you hit the ball, it makes an awful pop, and that's
just a very satisfying noise. It's an easy game to learn. In about 15 minutes of
practice, anyone can attain instant mediocrity."

Howard Brody;
Nuclear physicist who became an expert on the science of tennis and the benefits
of big rackets

BYLINE: Howard Brody

SECTION: FEATURES; Pg. 76,77

LENGTH: 694 words


During a family holiday in Florida in the 1970s, Howard Brody, a nuclear
physicist, made a discovery. It was nothing to do with the Big Bang - but
everything to do with tennis. Brody's curiosity was piqued when he noticed
someone playing with an oversized racket. He asked a coach what the benefits
were but the man did not know, so Brody decided to investigate.

His hobby soon became his life's work, as Brody became a leading expert on the
science of tennis, producing two books and numerous scholarly articles on the
subject. He held several positions on governing bodies, including membership of
the technical committee of the US Tennis Association. He often attended meetings
in tennis shoes. After his holiday, Brody corresponded with Howard Head, the
American engineer whose Prince company patented oversized rackets, and he later
become a consultant for them.

With tennis booming in the Seventies and technology becoming increas-ingly
important as players sought to hit the ball with ever more power, Brody had
found his niche. If projects such as analysing whether rubber vibration
dampeners are really worth the money lacked the seriousness of his previous work
on elementary particles, they brought him far more attention. "I discovered
things about 'sweet spots'. It was great fun and that was one of the reasons I
decided to give up particle physics and go into tennis racket physics. People
were so much more interested in it," he said.

In a 1988 interview, he said that his work required him to spend more time in a
laboratory, using lasers, mirrors and oscilloscopes to investigate what happens
when ball meets racket, than on court.

He determined that Head's oversized racket was superior since its "sweet spot"
was in the centre of the racket head rather than in the throat and because "it's
wider, which means its moment of inertia is greater. The moment of inertia is
that quantity which resists twisting. The racket therefore is more stable. If
you hit a ball off-axis it won't twist the racket as much and you don't lose as
much power."

Another important discovery was that looser strings created a slightly higher
ball velocity by storing and giving back more energy, which went counter to
previous thinking and to the racket-stringing habits of some of the hard-hitting
stars. However, stiffer frames, which vibrated less, were better than flexible
ones. As for reducing the risk of tennis elbow, "you should make every effort to
hit the ball close to the nodal point of the minimum vibration, which is near
the centre of the head of the racket."

Born in New Jersey in 1932, Howard Brody was a keen amateur player and was on
the varsity team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, though he was
modest about his ability. "I played on the high school tennis team for one year,
and the coach gave up," he once said. He described his brief time as interim
coach of the University of Pennsylvania men's team as the highlight of his
career.

He made regular trips to Wimbledon and once had a chance encounter with Arthur
Ashe while travelling by air. "I've always wanted to meet you," he told the
former world No 1. "Dr Brody, I've always wanted to meet you," came the reply.

He was an emeritus professor of physics at the University of Pennsylvania, where
he taught from 1959 until his retirement in 2000. He could see the tennis courts
from his office. He is survived by two daughters, Victoria Stevenson, a
financial analyst, and Deirdre Bernstein, a homemaker. His wife, Lois Chase
Brody, died in 2011.

Among the fruits of his research, he advised players to use a stiff racket for
power and control and a lightweight one if their style was based on
serveand-volley. He found that the winning player is usually the one who has
made the fewest unforced errors and that oversized rackets were more likely to
enhance ground strokes than serves.

He said that, in studying tennis, he came to the same conclusion that he might
have reached in quantum field theory: "You can't beat the laws of nature," he
wrote in 1987. "But you can use those laws to beat an opponent."

Howard Brody, physicist, was born on July 11, 1932. He died on August 11, 2015,
aged 83

MORRISSEY SELLS CLUB TO YMCA

BYLINE: Claudia MacLachlan Of the Post-Dispatch Staff

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. 1E

LENGTH: 747 words


Developer Joseph O. Morrissey has sold his racquet club in Jefferson City to the
YMCA for $1,175,000.  Morrissey said that he was not happy with the price, but
that he no longer wanted to manage the property because of its distance from St.
Louis.  ''It's not really a good price, but we were unsuccessful with absentee
ownership,'' Morrissey said. ''They are getting a tremendous facility at a good
price. We want to get into things that are more profitable.'' Morrissey said he
would use the sale proceeds to pay off the mortgage on the club, which he said
was about $900,000. The remainder would be used for severance pay and working
capital, he said.  Morrissey's various companies have lost about $30 million in
the last three years, according to his estimate. Last year, he was forced to put
into bankruptcy five apartment complexes in Florida, Mississippi, North Carolina
and South Carolina.  Morrissey still owns property in Gulf Shores, Ala., and
operates apartment complexes in Jefferson City and St. Joseph, Mo.  The racquet
club was built about 10 years ago, reportedly as a favor to former Gov. Joseph
P. Teasdale, whom Morrissey supported. The YMCA is buying the club with funds
from an anonymous donor, whom several sources identified as Art Firley.  Firley,
a major contributor to the Jefferson City YMCA and a board member, denied that
he was the donor. Firley said Jefferson City's Parks and Recreation Department
had been the first entity to express an interest in buying the racquet club.
''The city offered, but the private donor said the taxpayer should not have to
pay the cost,'' explained Firley.  The YMCA completed the purchase Friday and is
getting a spectacular building, says Bill Case, another board member. ''We
probably will have one of the finest Y's around,'' Case said. ''The most
exciting thing is that we are really going to have an opportunity to do more for
teens.'' The racquet club has four indoor tennis courts, six outdoor tennis
courts, nine indoor racquetball courts, a swimming pool, fitness center,
restaurant, bar and banquet facilities. Case said the YMCA planned some
renovations to accommodate indoor soccer and volleyball.  He said he was unsure
what the YMCA would do with the restaurant. The bar will be closed, Case said,
because the YMCA does not permit the sale of alcohol. ''We will honor the
banquets already on the books, and we may let them bring their own alcohol in,''
he said.  Case said the YMCA would honor all current racquet club memberships,
which total about 400. ''Membership was on the decline,'' he said.  The club was
owned by Broadmoor Country Club and Apartments of Jefferson City, a limited
partnership. The general partner was Town & Campus International, of which
Morrissey is the president and major shareholder.  Town and Campus is also the
general partner of at least four of the five apartment complexes that went into
bankruptcy last year.  Morrissey said he planned to continue operating an
apartment complex adjacent to the racquet club. ''We have no plans to sell the
apartments, '' he said.

Squash Rackets: Cannons in position at high noon

BYLINE: COLIN MCQUILLAN

SECTION: Issue 62582.

LENGTH: 569 words


Cannons Club, the fashionable sports and health centre built into the arches of
London's Cannon Street station, won last season's American Express premier
league by the narrowest of margins and at considerable corporate expense.

At lunchtime today Cannons begin their 1986-87 defence of the National League
title, this time backed by a new sponsorship deal with Inter City, the high
speed passenger service run by British Rail.


British squash boomed in the 1970s, developing from a small elitist game based
in public schools and private clubs into a classless and largely commercial
sport enthusiastically pursued by some three million players in more than 3,000
clubs around the country.

Gary Oliver, manager of Cannons Club, is one of many to believe that the sport
is approaching another surge.

'We are much more than just a squash club at Cannons, but we are determined to
be influential in the growth of the game as it reaches the international
proportions it truely deserves,' Oliver says.

If he can impress a few members and satisfy a few sponsors, neither Gary Oliver
nor the Jack Chia international hotel and health club chain for which he works
will be displeased.

The Squash Rackets Association owns its own transparent showcourt, a demountable
Perspex version, and there are permanent glass courts in far off luxury venues
such as Cairo and Muscat.

Neil Harvey and Ian Robinson, two of Oliver's professional players, actually own
the Cannons glass court through a new company, Telecourt, founded on Jack Chia
resources.

They spent most of the summer putting the deal together and anticipate home
fixtures for their own team, at lunchtimes to suit City workers.

Today, though, they convert back from businessmen to players, leading Inter
City-Cannons against newly promoted Visco Monroe, from Ossett, Yorkshire.

Seven of the world's top 10 players are registered among the 100 or so
professionals named for the ten Premier League clubs. The undefeated world
champion, Jahangir Khan, does not feature but the third ranked New Zealander,
Stuart Davenport, plays under Skol Lager sponsorship at Leicester.

The former world No. 2 Chris Dittmar of Australia plays for Visco Monroe, Gawain
Briars plays with Greg Pollard for Home Ales at Nottingham, and the British
champion, Philip Kenyon, joins Kelvin Smith for British Air Poundstretcher at
Dunnings Mill.

Even the Village Club from Prestwich, Manchester, came in as late replacement
for Armley complete with support from Arrow sportsclothes for a squad including
Ross Thorne, of Australia.

Only Ardleigh Hall, the Essex club rescued from redevelopment this summer by a
members' buy-out, Chapel Allerton and Manchester Northern are currently without
full seasonal sponsorship. Yet they still boast such players as, respectively,
Del Harris, David Pearson and Geoff Williams.

In two seasons the national league has become crucially important to squash. No
top player can afford to miss the competition offered by a league place. Leading
clubs are spending huge sums to get into the race and to win. American Express
have plainly played the card for which everyone in the game was waiting.

Crowns clinched in doubles leagues

SECTION: NEIGHBORHOOD TIMES; Pg. 14

LENGTH: 781 words


While most men's and women's teams are nearing completion in USA Senior Doubles
League competition, a few divisions have named their champions.

Among the winners are Seminole Lake Tennis Center in the 4.0 South men's
division and the Racquet Club of St. Petersburg's 3.5 South team.

"We have a better team this year," second-year Seminole captain Red McGarry
said, "as we have added enough depth to cover us on injuries, travel and family
obligations.

"We also have a philosophy where every member of the team will get into at least
two matches ," McGarry said.

Seminole is 6-0 in its division and, with just two matches remaining is
guaranteed first place.

The Racquet Club and Vinoy are battling for second. The top two teams will enter
a round-robin tournament with the top two teams in the 4.0 North division to
determine the county's entry in the state tournament.

"When we formed this team, we, of course, wanted to win," Seminole assistant
captain John Beda said.

"No. 1 for us, though, was to create team spirit," he said. "We're set up to
play everybody."

Last year the team was unbeaten until it faced Clearwater's McMullen team in the
playoff. McMullen went on to win the state and advance to the national
tournament.

"We pick the teams from week-to-week based on who's available, who's working
well together and then place them in the best position," Beda said.

"Krishnan (Anandan) at Seminole has been like our general manager and helped us
a lot with each week's roster and setting practice courts aside for us," he
said.

Joining McGarry and Beda are veteran team members Larry Daum, Maura Rodriguez,
Ron Klieve, Tim Kahle, John Leavengood, Jim Johnson, Harold Kligman and Leo
Leonardi, along with newcomers Jim McCook, Andre Cakarnis, Les Gustin, Vic
Vicander and Rick Ebelke.

Also guaranteed a spot in the playoffs is the Racquet Club's 3.5 senior men's
squad. Unbeaten in six matches, the Racquet Club is the defending 3.5 local
champion.

Returning players include captain Marshall Craig, Ray Cianci, Paul Stewart,
George Routh, Tony Damouny and David Laesser. Neel Voss, Jim Montgomery and Jim
Nieset round out the squad.

The Racquet Club will wait for the outcome of the 3.5 Central and North
divisions and enter a round-robin playoff among the three, plus a wildcard team.

Trading wins in the two-team 4.5 senior men's division are the Racquet Club and
the Phil Green Tennis Academy.

Last week's 2-1 victory, on the play of Tim Brady and Ralph Howe in No. 1 and
Jim Pesuth and Carl Stiel in No. 3, gave the Racquet Club an edge over PGTA. The
teams play three more times to determine the overall winner.

Still in the heat of competition and at the front of the pack are Bardmoor Golf
and Tennis Club's men in the 3.5 Central division; Paradise Island and Racquet
Club's 4.0 senior women's teams; Paradise Island's 3.5 senior women.

Bardmoor helped itself last weekend with a 3-0 win over Royal Racquet Club to
even its record (5-1) with McMullen. The two play Saturday at McMullen.

Back-to-back 3-0 wins for the Paradise Island 4.0 women raised their record to
4-0, an edge over the Racquet Club at 3-0. Paradise Island hosts the Racquet
Club Saturday.

Paradise Island's second-place 3.5 team faces third-place McMullen (6-2)
Saturday, while first-place Innisbrook (7-1) plays at the Vinoy (0-7).

Senior league competition concludes next month for all divisions.

A LEGEND: Tennis lost one of its best last month with the death of Jack Staton,
93, of St. Pete Beach.

Over a playing career beginning at the age of 30, Staton won 62 national titles
and played on various U.S. Tennis Association teams in international
competition.

Staton earned top adult and senior rankings, including a No. 1 world ranking in
1983. In Florida, Staton claimed top rankings over a nine-year period and was
selected to the state association's Hall of Fame in 1983.

NET SHOTS: Treasure Island's John Rensch paired with Ed Hamilton of St. Pete
Beach to defend their top seeding in the men's 60-and-over doubles division in
Naples' Julius Lesser 2003 state-sanctioned tournament.

Rensch reached the round of 16 in the 60 singles. No. 2 doubles team Peter Crewe
of St. Petersburg and Ron Tonidandel of Sarasota reached the final before losing
to the top seed.

+ This week, Bob Meyerdierks and Don Mathias of St. Petersburg are competing in
the Sterling Oaks Senior Classic in Naples.

Meyerdierks is the No. 2 seed in the 75 singles and Mathias is entered in the 65
singles.

+ Christine Guerrir of St. Petersburg played to the main-draw quarterfinal and
to the girls 18-and-under consolation final in the  Tampa Palms Junior New Year
Kickoff in Tampa.

Rackets: Silence greets rackets king; Conrad Leach talks to a champion in his
10th year on top of the world

BYLINE: Conrad Leach

SECTION: SPORT; Page 15

LENGTH: 495 words


AT THE BBC's Sports Personality of the Year awards ceremony last month, an event
designed to celebrate the best in British sport, there was one absentee who
possibly had more of a right to be there than many of the black-tie brigade. A
world champion for 10 years, who plays the first leg of his tit-le defence in
Chicago next Saturday, the No 1 of rackets, James Male, was simply not on the
list, like some rejected New Year's Eve partygoer.

Someone at the BBC must have an aversion to Male or the game of rackets, for he
applied to appear on Question of Sport in 1995 having just defended his title
against Neil Smith, his challenger again next week, only to receive a curt reply
stating the programme featured only sportsmen or women at the top of their
profession.

That is some snub for a man who chases a golf-ball-sized projectile which flies
at speeds up to and over 130mph around an area more than twice the size of a
squash court and has retained his pre-eminence for so long. And it is difficult
to see what Male, a former banker in a game that, ironically, started out 200
years ago against the courtyard walls of debtors' prisons, can do to make
himself any better.

Male, 34, can already claim with some justification to be rackets' most
successful ever exponent, being the only person to have won the world
championship four consecutive times in its two-legged trans-Atlantic format, not
to mention a mighty haul of 38 other singles and doubles titles.

But Male, an amateur, albeit a highly serious one in a sport where professionals
are in the minority, such are the small rewards on offer, has tried his luck and
coordination at real tennis as well as, more notably, baseball.  Spotted by the
owner of the Atlanta Braves as he defended his title in Philadelphia in 1993
against Smith, he travelled to Georgia the following year for a trial as a
batter. The exercise lasted more than three months, but his ambitions were
thwarted by the players' strike that was brewing at the time.

The defence in 1993 was the closest Male had come to cashing in his chips as
champion when his unique ambidextrous style, that sees him serve with different
hands and play double-handed forehands and backhands, was almost undone by the
taller, languid left-handed Smith.

Playing the best-of-seven sets, Smith won 4-2 in America, leaving him needing
three sets in the second leg at Queen's Club, London, to claim Male's crown.
Smith won the first set only for the resilient Male to haul him back and win 6-5
on aggregate in the closest final for 21 years.

Smith moved from England to America nearly 10 years ago and now has his sights
firmly set on finally avenging that defeat, knowing that at the age of 35 he is
running out of time to challenge Male. "It is something that would be great to
finish your career on, no doubt about it," Smith said.

Whether it would get him on to the BBC, though, is a different matter entirely.

Girl finds tennis racket ordered online to be lacking

SECTION: Pg. A7

LENGTH: 516 words


Though only 13, Sarah Thurston of Cape Elizabeth is serious about her tennis.

She had set her sights on a new racquet. Not just any racquet, but a braided
graphite and Kevlar Slazenger Pro X1 weighing a slight 12 ounces, sporting a
95-square-inch head and 27-inch length, with 8 points head light and a 16/18
string pattern. Don't ask what that all means. But that's exactly the racquet
Sarah wanted to suit her height (5-foot-2), arm length and strength.

Now, Sarah is one of those special people who doesn't expect Mom and Dad to pay
for everything. She spent the winter baby-sitting and saving soda bottles to buy
the coveted racquet and a new tennis outfit. By February, Sarah had saved more
than $200 and started shopping online.

Slazenger Pro X1 racquets usually retail for $149, but Sarah, a smart shopper,
discovered a "special bargain price" of $129 at Top Sports Ltd. in Burbank,
Calif. Using Dad's credit card (with permission), she ordered the racquet and a
Balle de Match girl's sunshine top and cloudy skirt for $26.99 each.

Two weeks later, UPS dropped off a package from California while Sarah paced
nervously inside the house. According to her mom, Sarah "wore a rut in the rug"
during the wait. She was in her new outfit almost before the packing box hit the
floor and, before long, she was practicing her backhand in the living room while
Mom watched the lamps and chewed her fingernails.

The only thing keeping Sarah from her destiny at Wimbledon was the 16 inches of
snow on the ground.

But surely as McEnroe will bark at a line judge, Maine's snow will melt. And
once the puddles were off the courts and the net was up, Sarah was out there on
her schoolyard court.

She hauled her little brother Timmy along as a practice dummy.

But the first time Sarah tossed her Wilson titanium tennis ball into the air, it
came down hard with a crushing right-handed service.

Something felt terribly wrong.

Instead of a "boing," she heard a "fump" (don't ask ... it's a tennis thing).
Her service came flying back, something Timmy seldom accomplished. But when she
took her next slice at the ball: "fump." The racquet was dead! There was no
"sweet spot." Every racquet has three "sweet spots." In a general sense, the
sweet spot is the area of the string bed that produces the best combination of
feel or power or ... the boing.

It was obvious that Sarah had received defective merchandise. She was crushed.

Then she talked to her dad.

Dad Thurston, who at one time had attended law school, counseled his daughter
that surely the company would send a replacement. They were soon to find out
what many Internet shoppers already know: There is nothing certain about doing
business on the Internet.

Next week we'll tell you the rest of Sarah's story.

Squash executive sees gains in his game

BYLINE: By Charlie Garfinkel

SECTION: SPORTS; RACKET SPORTS; Pg. C7

LENGTH: 724 words


Kevin Klipstein is the executive director of the United States Squash Racquets
Association. He recently told a group at the Buffalo Tennis & Squash Club that
"squash was on a major upswing in the United States and elsewhere" and that he
was thrilled to be a small part of the sport's progress.

Although Klipstein played down his role, it is evident that his enthusiastic
leadership is playing a big part in the sport's growth. He has a great passion
for the sport and has done a superb job as the sport's leader over the past nine
months.

"My purpose in coming to Buffalo was twofold," he said. "I wanted to meet the
squash people face to face in this area, and I wanted to listen to their ideas
and concerns. Fortunately, my visit more than lived up to my expectations."

He stressed that, like in any sport, young people are the backbone of squash. He
noted that White Oaks in St. Catharines, Ont., hosted a Canadian-American Squash
Challenge Invitational on Sept. 11-12 for 13-under and 15-under divisions. A
week later, it hosted the 17-under tournament.

In high school competition the USSRA National Team Championships were held at
Yale two years ago. There were 43 teams entered, an increase of 16 from just a
few years before.

"We're in the process of linking many of the high schools with colleges that
have facilities in their immediate area. We are very pleased with the overall
results that have occurred," said Klipstein, who said this was a phenomenal rise
for the high schools in the United States.

A program of which Klipstein is especially proud is the "Square Busters"
program, which has been implemented in the inner cities of New York,
Philadelphia, Chicago and Washington, D.C. The program consists of mentoring and
tutoring for children, community service projects and squash instruction.

"We are hoping to expose the program to children who haven't had an opportunity
to play the game," Klipstein said. "The total program greatly helps in giving
the children a more positive outlook about themselves and the people that they
are directly involved with."

For junior players who have already been heavily involved in the game, there is
a national tournament for players who are ranked worse than 32nd in the country.
Players who are ranked 33rd and lower will be able to compete against players
who are closer to their level of play. This helps to keep interest at a high
level for players who may not have a chance against players who are ranked
considerably higher than they are.

Health and fitness clubs are also getting more involved in squash. .

"Membership retention is actually at a higher level than the members of the
fitness programs in many health clubs. Part of this stems from the great social
aspects that squash imparts," Klipstein said.

Klipstein and the squash association are striving hard to get squash
representatives into high schools to help them set up programs in the school or
at nearby squash facilities.

College squash is also progressing well. Within the last couple of years,
universities such as Southern California, Notre Dame, Purdue and Washington have
joined the USSRA.

Klipstein said the game of squash is easier to learn today than it was a few
years ago. This is due to the ball being softer and staying in play longer. As
in racquetball, players can compete at any level, enjoy almost immediate success
and will get a workout. Best of all, they will meet many new people and
experience the euphoria the game provides, he said.

Hard ball squash is still very popular in some areas. Although it isn't promoted
as much as the soft ball, it is a good option for older players as the ball
moves faster and the game is less physically demanding. Hard ball is also the
ball of choice for doubles play.

Women's squash is also on the rise. The Junior Women's World Championships were
held in Belgium earlier in the year and the United States' team finished fourth
of 20.

"Squash is also spreading internationally and cuts across all cultures,"
Klipstein said. "That is why you see the game growing in Egypt, South Africa,
Pakistan, England, Australia and South America."

Locally, Ed Jocoy, announced that an International Junior Squash tournament will
be held at the Buffalo Tennis & Squash Club and Nichols School in January.

The Mamaroneck Village Board last week unanimously approved a contract for a
private company to build and operate a new clubhouse and multi-sport center at
Harbor Island Park but delayed awarding the contract. Some residents urged the
board to postpone action on the plan until a task force begins studying the park
in June. Others praised the board, saying the tennis courts at the park have
been poorly maintained for years. The contract would require replacing the
park's eight clay tennis courts with a faster-drying surface. The board will
vote on June 5 whether to give the contract to Harbor View Racquet Club, the
current manager of the courts, or Sportime, a Long Island-based company.

Once-little-known racket became a go-to for many

NEW YORK -- Andy Roddick recalls seeing the distinctive oval rackets with white
stripes at European junior tournaments in the late 1990s. But it wasn't until
his then-coach, former French tennis pro Tarik Benhabiles, carried the Babolat
VS frames back from France that Roddick got one in his hands.

"After about five minutes, I asked him to get me a couple more," says Roddick,
who switched and four months later was No.1 in the world junior rankings.

Roddick, now 25 and the top-ranked American at this week's U.S. Open, was not
the only instant Babolat convert. Then known primarily for strings, Babolat
(BAH-bow-lah) took a swing at the racket market in 1994 and has become the
fastest-growing maker in the world. It is third in world market share.

Babolat carefully orchestrated a U.S. launch seven years ago and now challenges
market leaders Wilson Sporting Goods, Prince Sports and Head/Penn Racquet
Sports, with 16% of the $110 million in U.S. specialty retail sales through the
first half of 2007.

Among demanding pros, Babolat has served aces: About 22% of the top 100 male and
female players use its frames, tying Wilson and Prince.

Mark Mason, owner of New York's Mason's Tennis Mart, says, "It is the greatest
phenomenon in tennis racket history."

Kevin Kempin, vice president for sales and marketing with Head/Penn, says,
"Where it was once Wilson, Head and Prince, Babolat has come along and added a
fourth competitor."

Privately held Babolat was founded in 1875 and invented the first natural gut
strings for tennis, so it had credibility when it gambled on rackets 13 years
ago.

"We were already insiders," says Eric Babolat, 37, the fifth-generation CEO of
the Lyon, France-based company. But it caught rivals flat-footed. "They didn't
think we were serious about rackets."

Tragedy nearly derailed the push into frames, though. Eric's father, Pierre,
died in the Swissair crash off Nova Scotia in 1998. At age 28, with only a few
years of marketing experience, Eric became CEO just four years into the racket
launch.

"I can say that it was a tough time, but it was clear for everyone to push the
racket part of the business," says Eric, a father of two.

"I didn't question whether I wanted to do it. I just tried," adds the CEO, who
has gone on to lead four-fold sales growth to about $116 million in 2006.

Babolat's first ace was successfully "seeding" its rackets to a generation of
talented juniors by leveraging its top-notch strings. Essentially, it told them
that to get free strings, they had to use Babolat rackets.

For its U.S. rollout, the company avoided chains and stuck with tennis-only
retailers and pro shops that would better promote the brand. It has aggressively
protected sales territories and "minimum advertised pricing," keeping margins
and retailer loyalty high.

A simple product line and a focus on improving existing products has won buyers
weary of seeing last year's racket supplanted by yet another "upgrade."

But the biggest breakthrough may have been landing Roddick. Babolat was a
growing force in Europe (its first big pro win was Carlos Moya's championship in
the 1998 French Open using the blue-and-white Pure Drive) when it signed
Roddick. The big-serving heartthrob then surged in the rankings, capped by his
2003 U.S. Open win and subsequent ascent to No.1.

"Their lightning in a bottle was getting Andy Roddick," says Don Hightower,
president of online retailer Tenniswarehouse.com, a unit of Sports Warehouse.

With Roddick and players such as triple French Open winner Rafael Nadal on
board, the Pure Drive frame hit No.1 in pro/specialty sales in September 2002
and held it all but two months through March 2006, reports researcher Sports
Marketing Surveys.

Beyond pro visibility, the rackets had to strike a nerve with club players who,
when spending $200-plus on frames, try them before buying. Light and
maneuverable, with hip looks and features such as a "woofer" system that keeps
the ball on the strings longer and vibration filtering, the rackets won both
leisure and competitive players. "They sort of invented that 'tweener'
category," Hightower says.

But just as Roger Federer has eclipsed Roddick atop men's tennis, Babolat faces
a volley of challenges.

While U.S. sales continue to grow, dollar market share growth has flattened
after peaking above 18%. Its three main rivals have new racket technologies this
year, such as Wilson's K Factor (used by Federer) and Prince's O3 line (Maria
Sharapova's choice).

"You keep wondering: Will Pure Drive keep selling?" says John Swetka, owner
Swetka's Tennis Shop in Mountain View, Calif.

As Babolat has gone from about 150 to 900 U.S. outlets, distribution has been a
challenge, and it has had to reassure retailers about territorial exclusivity.

Meanwhile, Babolat last year partnered with Michelin for its first foray into
tennis shoes.

Perhaps most telling, Babolat's small lineup and players' racket reputation have
limited headway into the oversized power frames many club players use -- a
weakness being seized upon by larger rivals. "Right now they are kind of a two-
racket company," says Jon Muir, general manager of Wilson Racquet Sports,
referring to the Pure Drive and AeroPro Drive lines.

These untapped markets could just as easily fuel Babolat growth. But this time
around, the competition won't be caught at love.

Racquet Club recognized with award: Utah Tennis Association names it
'Organization of the Year'

BYLINE: Adia Waldburger, Park Record, Park City, Utah

SECTION: SPORTS

LENGTH: 408 words


Feb. 14--A couple of weeks ago, Park City Racquet Club head pro Laurie Lambert
opened some of the best mail she had received all year.

It was a notification that the tennis club she oversees had received the 2008
Organization of the Year Award from the Utah Tennis Association (UTA). Although
this is an award for which a club could nominate itself, Lambert didn't know
that the Racquet Club's name had been thrown into the hat. When she received the
letter, she was elated.

In just the second year that the award had been given, Lambert feels pretty
lucky that her club has received it. With the outdoor recreation culture of
Southern Utah, there are a number of booming tennis clubs to compete with as
well as a slew of other strong programs spanning the state.

The Utah Tennis Association, the governing body over all tournaments within the
state, designed the award to recognize organizations that encourage innovation
and growth. The award also recognizes the organization that they feel has done
the most to further the sport in the community.

"The Park City Racquet Club has truly been the cornerstone of tennis in Summit
County and has been enjoyed by the entire tennis community and you are to be
commended for your dedication and involvement in promoting and growing the
game," said UTA president Ken Harris in a letter.

In the past year, the club has been busy. It began hosting a junior league on
Saturday nights. It welcomed youth from Heber to use the club as their home
practice

facility. Then, this summer, it teamed up with Holy Cross Ministries to offer a
six-week tennis camp to deserving children.

"We're really doing what we can to increase the tennis community," Lambert said.

The Racquet Club also hosts a number of leagues for all ages as well as local,
regional and national tournaments.

Lambert and co-head pro Bill Damron accepted the award at a banquet held in at
the Cottonwood Country Club in Salt Lake City on Jan. 29. Park City resident and
key member of the tennis community Marilyn Burrell presented the award.

7 Arrested in U.S. Effort to Stop Cuban-Cigar Sales

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

SECTION: Section B; Page 1; Column 3; Metropolitan Desk

LENGTH: 822 words


Taking aim at outlaw cigar aficionados, Federal officials have charged the
operators of an upscale restaurant and a private club in Manhattan with selling
illicit Cuban cigars to customers, and yesterday four other men were also
arrested on cigar-related charges.

On Wednesday, Federal agents armed with search warrants seized hundreds of boxes
of cigars from the walk-in humidors of the Patroon restaurant on East 46th
Street and the Racquet and Tennis Club on Park Avenue. A Federal spokesman put
their value at several hundred thousand dollars.

Robert Gressler, a manager at the men-only Racquet and Tennis Club, and Alex
Hasbany, manager of the cigar room at Patroon, were arrested and charged with
conspiring to violate the Trading With the Enemy Act by buying and selling
cigars made in Cuba. Kenneth Aretsky, the owner of Patroon, surrendered in
Federal Court yesterday and was also charged with violating the trading act. Mr.
Aretsky, a former owner of the restaurant "21," declined comment about the
charges.

The four others arrested yesterday -- identified as Kenneth Joseph, 44; Laurence
Zimmerman, an investor for whom no age was available; John Steinhardt, 44, and
Edward Marron, a 52-year-old investment banker -- were released on their own
recognizance.

"This makes no sense," said Michael Kennedy, lawyer for Mr. Joseph, who is chief
executive of W.H. Industries, a privately held manufacturer of automotive parts
in Northvale, N.J. "It is both absurd and arcane to think that an individual
American who buys a cigar from another American can be arrested for trading with
the enemy."

Some cigar-lovers also bristled in response to the prosecutions, terming the
raids a publicity stunt. "In a time when there aren't enough agents to go after
drug dealers, it seems ridiculous that they have the manpower to chase down
Cuban cigars, when it's just a matter of time before the embargo against Cuba is
lifted," said Mark Grossich, owner of the Cigar Bar at Beekman Bar and Books and
two other cigar-friendly bars in Manhattan. "Castro isn't going to be in power
forever."

Federal law enforcement officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said that
the prosecutions followed six other systematic efforts by customs agents to stem
the spread of Cuban cigars: four in Florida, one in California and one in the
District of Columbia. In April, customs officials began investigating the
shipment of Cuban cigars to an address in Connecticut, where they found lists of
clients, including businesses and private clubs, investigators said.

According to customs officials, 240,523 Cuban cigars worth an estimated $3.1
million -- or $12.99 per cigar -- were seized in the United States in 1997, more
than double the 96,216 cigars seized in 1996.

The importation of Cuban cigars is a felony under Federal law; an exception can
be made for cigars worth less than $100 that are brought in their luggage by
travelers arriving directly from Cuba.

To be sure, almost since the United States imposed a trade embargo on Cuba in
the early 1960's, American cigar smokers in the thousands have hidden verboten
stogies in their luggage in the attempt to get them past customs inspectors.

For decades, tobacconists in London, Toronto, Mexico City and elsewhere have
pursued a profitable sideline mailing contraband Cuban cigars to customers in
the United States. Usually the bands, labels and boxes are removed to prevent
their identification by postal authorities.

Run-of-the-mill tourists usually suffer no more than confiscation, but the
penalties for those importing or selling Cuban cigars in commercial quantities
can be severe: up to to 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $100,000.
Penalties in the six recent Federal prosecutions have included fines and guilty
pleas but not jail sentences.

Experts said there was an abundance of bootleg Cuban Cohibas, Montecristos,
Romeo Y Julietas and many more questionably nondescript Cuban -- and
pseudo-Cuban -- cigars available in the city and across the country.

There are dozens of "cigar friendly" bars, restaurants and clubs in New York
City catering to aficionados whose ranks have swollen in recent years. "There is
a great pressure to supply Cubans to your upscale clientele," said Jeff Tass,
who for three years owned the Havana Tea Room and Cigar House at 265 East 78th
Street, and recently reopened it as a restaurant, the Palmetta Plantation House.

"I would tell them that not only has their sale been illegal since 1961, but I
would remind them that the quality of Cuban cigars has been increasingly
inferior," he said. "These days, the Cubans are rolling just about anything that
falls off a tree."

Mr. Grossich, the Cigar Bar owner, said that the cigar fad had plateaued, but
added: "The market isn't contracting. We now have a lot of cigar smokers who are
truly aficionados, and they enjoy coming to our establishments."

Playoff-bound Racquet Club wins with depth

BYLINE: NANCY MORGAn

SECTION: NEIGHBORHOOD TIMES; TENNIS; Pg. 22

LENGTH: 592 words



Jim Cohen, captain of the men's 4.5 team at the Racquet Club of St.  Petersburg,
credits other local teams with making the St. Petersburg squad  tougher.

"Some players moved up from the 4.5 level from last year's team and some  teams
then lost some of their firepower," said Cohen, "but I believe we had  more good
teams with better depth."

Cohen said the Racquet Club strived to schedule the best team possible each
week in the U.S. Tennis Association/Florida Section adult league due to  overall
stronger teams. The Racquet Club was unbeaten until last Saturday's  match with
McMullen.

"That was our first and only loss this season," Cohen said. "We lost it  3-2."

Cohen is graced with a number of singles players to fill the team's two  spots,
unusual on most teams. He relies on Jerry Meadows, Jim Hartley and  himself for
the majority of the singles, but also utilizes Steve Riley and Tim  Brady.

"We have a fair amount of depth on our team this year," Co hen said. "We  added
Jerry and Ralph Howe to last year's team and that helped."

Hernan Molina, Ken Heretick, Mitch Lee, John O'Brien, Jan Legergren and  Brian
Smith rotate in the three doubles positions in team matches.

The Racquet Club hosts Safety Harbor Spa on Saturday for the first match in  a
best-two-of-three playoff for a berth in regional competition in July. The
Racquet Club plays McMullen on June 14, followed by the Royal Racquet Club on
June 21.

"We are familiar with most of the Spa's players and we expect it to be a  tough
match," Cohen said. "We have the home-court advantage in all the  playoff
matches, and that should be good for us."

OTHER MEN'S PLAYOFFS: Playoffs also begin Saturday in the 3.5 and 4.0
divisions. Innisbrook won the 5.0 district title and waits for the July
regional competition.

Innisbrook hosts a Racquet Club team while an East Lake team plays at the  Vinoy
in the first round of 3.5 matches. In the 4.0 playoff, another Racquet  Club
team travels to Countryside Country Club and East Lake is at St.  Petersburg
Tennis Center.

WOMEN'S PLAYOFFS: East Lake has won the 3.0 and 4.0 Nets divisions;  Paradise
Island is first in the 4.0 Sets. Saturday, East Lake and Paradise  enter a
playoff with wild-card teams from the Sets and Nets to determine the  district
winner. McMullen was first in the 4.5, as was Bardmoor in the 5.0.

JUNIOR TOURNAMENT: Siblings Kelly and Danny McCain of St. Petersburg won  their
respective age divisions in last month's End of School Classic at East  Lake
Woodlands Country Club. Kelly won the girls 16 in straight sets, as did  Danny
in the boys 18.

Rachel Silverberg of Largo outlasted Seminole's Misa Svarcova in the girls  10,
winning 6-3, 1-6, 7-5. Brandon Pierpont of St. Petersburg was a boys 12
finalist.

In consolation action in the state-sanctioned tournament, Kelly Nelson of  St.
Petersburg topped Largo's Leah Lynch 6-1, 6-1 in the girls 16. Other local
consolation winners were Amanda Yogus (girls 10), Jeswin Jolly (boys 16),
George Navas (boys 12) and Vikram Anandan (boys 10).

COUNTRYSIDE WINS CCA: Countryside Country Club recently won its first  Country
Clubs of America Challenge Cup at a tournament in Hilton Head, S.C.

The national team championship involved 25 clubs, each with two doubles  teams.
In all, 248 women competed.

Robin Meinrod and Anne Beauchamp won the 9.0 individual national title;  Janie
Bean and Sylvette Sola were semifinalists in the 8.0. Together, the two  teams
earned the overall Challenge Cup.

St. Petersburg teams win 3 USA League titles

BYLINE: NANCY MORGAN

SECTION: NEIGHBORHOOD TIMES; TENNIS; Pg. 18

LENGTH: 978 words



St. Petersburg adult teams captured three of six USA League Tennis championships
in last weekend's playoff finals.

The Racquet Club of St. Petersburg won the women's 4.0 title, the Renaissance
Vinoy the men's 3.5, and the Treasure Island Recreation Center the men's 4.5.

Also winning were East Lake Woodlands in the women's 3.0 and 3.5 divisions and
Seminole Lakes Tennis Center in the men's 4.0. Treasure Island Tennis and Yacht
Club's 4.5 women's team and Feather Sound Country Club's 3.0 were division
winners that did not require playoffs. All advance to regional competition next
month.

"The Vinoy had a good team and they were tough, but I think our experience
helped us get past them," said Patti Johnston, captain of the Racquet Club's 4.0
team. "Plus, our pro, John Haggar, was a great coach."

Linda Miller in No. 1 singles and Carol Nelson and Sonia Raymond in No. 1
doubles earned the first two points for the Racquet Club. The Vinoy's Diane
Gabay and Karen Howley took a point in No. 2 doubles, then Chris Agee and
Barbara Boucek won in No. 3 to clinch the team match. Johnston retired in No. 2
singles against Carol Fontaine.

"After I knew we won I just wanted to celebrate," said Johnston. "We had players
like Sonia, Barbara and Jean Krause that even changed travel plans to play this
match. We wanted to celebrate the win."

Rounding out the Racquet Club team are Donna Brewer, Irene Haggar, Darcy Giroud,
Martha Gilkes, Gail Razook, Sandy Martin, Gisela Levya, Mary Ellen Shevlin and
Diana Craig.

The Vinoy's 3.5 men's team thought at the beginning of the season that a .500
record would be good. As it turned out, the team was 7-1 in the regular season
and 3-0 in the playoffs. Saturday's 4-1 victory over the Racquet Club not only
clinched the district championship but also avenged last year's loss to the
Racquet Club.

"What is so special to us is that everyone on our team contributed at least
three wins during the season," said Norm Ott, the Vinoy's 3.5 captain. "It
seemed as we played day by day that someone would step up and win when we least
expected it."

In the final, Terry Brett in No. 1 singles and Don Mathias in No. 2 scored wins
for the Vinoy over Jeff Doty and Tim Bourne respectively. Pat Dines and Gordon
Nichols defeated the Racquet Club's Bob Dickerson and Tom Stewart in No. 1
doubles, but Bob Wahl and Neel Voss answered with a two-set win over the Vinoy's
Ott and Tony Gentile. Up 3-1, Sie Kamide and Don Wheeler defeated Ray Cianci and
Tony Damouny to give the Vinoy its 4-1 victory.

Also playing for the Vinoy are Jeff Szilage, Dave Calametti, Dean Lampe, D.J.
Korns, Ed Kidston and Dick Graf.

For the fifth consecutive year, according to Steve Reilly, Treasure Island
Recreation Center's 4.5 captain, the final came down to a contest with Royal
Racquet Club. This time, the Treasure Island squad blanked the opponents 5-0.

"We have a lot of respect for Royal's team and always have," said Reilly. "We
know they can sneak up on you and we know that we must plan to play well to
win."

The TI Center team won four matches in straight sets. Pat Brady in No. 1 singles
defeated Royal's Kurt Long 6-3, 6-3, and Jim Cohen in No. 2 defeated Bill
Christenson 6-3, 6-1. Robin Kippenberger and Darrel Stewart added a third win in
No. 1 doubles with a 6-0, 6-0 victory over Andy Lynn and Trace Bower, and
Steve's brother Paul teamed with Pierce Kelly to defeat Pat Siracusa and Ron
Wiser 6-4, 6-4 in No. 2 doubles. Steve Reilly and Pat Brady's brother Tim won in
No. 3 over Paul Berg and Graham Bell in a third-set tiebreaker.

Other players on the TI Center team are Ken Heretick, Ralph Howe, Jeff Juilen,
Bill Funk and Novikou Sirgei.

"We have a tremendous amount of state and national competitive tournament play
experience on this team," said Steve Reilly. "At the next level, however, we are
being cautiously optimistic about our chances. We know we must plan to play well
and there's always the luck factor."

Local league winners will face teams from Sarasota, Tampa, Naples and Fort Myers
in the regional tournament July 21-24 at Longboat Key. Those winners advance to
the state tournament in August.

A LEGEND DIES: Eddie Herr, 93, one of the founders of the USTA Florida Section
along with Ed Turville and Tom Garlough, died Saturday in south Florida. Herr
created the Orange Bowl International Tennis Tournament, the Sunshine Cup, the
Continental Players Cup and the Eddie Herr International Junior Tournament, all
of which have become recognized as among the most prestigious junior events in
the world.

JUNIOR WINNERS: Top-seeded Jose Tolentino of St. Petersburg won the boys
14-and-under singles title in last weekend's SPTC Junior Open 2000 at the St.
Petersburg Tennis Center. Tolentino held off No. 2 seed Serguei Boulanov of
Bradenton 6-4, 6-4.

Other local winners included No. 1 seed Katherine Waldthausen in the girls 14s
and Adel Nasser in the boys 16s. Elyse Roenick won the girls 14s consolation, as
did Helmut Waldthausen the boys 16s.

CELEBRATION: Royal Racquet Club is hosting a TNT Wimbledon GRASSroots Promotion

New year, new team for Super Seniors

BYLINE: NANCY MORGAN

SECTION: NEIGHBORHOOD TIMES; TENNIS; Pg. 18

LENGTH: 855 words



The USA Tennis Super Seniors League served up its first matches this week in the
men's division. Next month, women's competition begins.

Competition is Tuesday afternoons for the men and Monday mornings for the women.

Currently, only the men's 3.5 division is active with four teams in the north
and five in the south.

The north division consists of Timber Pines Tennis Club, Royal Racquet Club, the
Westin Innisbrook Resort and the Phil Green Tennis Academy.

The south division includes Treasure Island Tennis and Yacht Club, Shipwatch
Tennis Club, the St. Petersburg Tennis Center, the Renaissance Vinoy and
Bardmoor Golf and Tennis Club.

The division will have a four-team playoff for the top two teams from both the
north and south, said Seaton Kenworthy, coordinator for the men's league. The
winner will move on to the state tournament.

Treasure Island Tennis and Yacht Club is competing for the first time, with
Ralph Capasso the captain.

Joining Capasso in the first match with Bardmoor on Tuesday were Gary Cobb, Ken
Jones, Stephen Newman, John Scheidt, Dave Connally, Kurt Geer, Herb Green, Dick
Cook, Bill Hadley and Gordon Coyle.

"I'm new to the club and when I found out we didn't have a team in the super
seniors, I guess I volunteered," Capasso said.

The league continues through mid-March with playoffs slated to begin March 26.

Among the women's teams scheduled to begin competition next month are Timber
Pines Tennis Club's 3.0, Innisbrook's 3.5 and Treasure Island Tennis and Yacht
Club's 4.0 teams.

Jane Lee Cobb is captain of the TI team that includes returnees Cini Malone,
June Ide, Shari Green, Lynn Hesse, Margie Scheidt, Betty Crockett, Janice Stone
and Marcia Sedgwick along with newcomer Faye Bates.

"We're working on our partnerships now and getting in some practice matches,"
Cobb said. "Without any opponents in our division we advance directly to the
state tournament so that means we need to keep up our camaraderie and enthusiasm
until the spring.

"Plus, we have to be ready to play with a variety of people because you never
know about injuries or illnesses or anything else that could keep someone from
playing," she said.

Last year, TI's 4.0, Innisbrook's 3.5 and Timber Pines' 3.0 all advanced to the
state tournament for the women while Innisbrook's 3.5 and Timber Pines' 4.0
represented the men.

LEAGUE UPDATES: The Racquet Club of St. Petersburg netted a 3-0 win over the
Phil Green Tennis Academy in the USA Adult 8.5 Mixed League last weekend.

Straight-set winners were Maria and Don Drew in No. 1, Linda Miller and Vic
Vicander No. 2 and Sandy Martin and Jan Lagergren No. 3.

Bardmoor's Sylvia and Bob Hagerman scored the senior 7.5 team's only point
against Royal Racquet Club in its 2-1 loss.

In senior men's 3.5 action, the Racquet Club teams won 3-0 in both the south and
central divisions.

Winning in the south division were Newton Rogers and Marty Normile in No. 1,
Gary Elliot and David Farnsworth No. 2 and Bob Spiegel and Mack Hicks No. 3. In
the central division, Racquet Club's Tony Damouny and Steve Uebel in No. 1, Ray
Cianci and David Laesser No. 2 and Don Campagna and Bob Steele No. 3 all won in
straight sets.

Feather Sound's Deborah Brunt and Jan Cox in No. 1, Marilyn Quackenbush and Lucy
Read No. 2 and Terry Hubener and Dede Natale No. 3 scored wins against the
Renaissance Vinoy in the senior women's 3.5.

Patti Barlow and Elizabeth Cooke netted the Racquet Club's only point against
McMullen in its 2-1 loss.

Treasure Island Tennis and Yacht Club leads the senior women's 4.0 division with
a 4-1 record. In second-place is the Racquet Club, which handed TI its only loss
through five matches.

 NET NOTES A rematch between Lindsay Dvorak and Alexandra Cercone in the girls
12-and-under in last weekend's SPTC Junior Championship resulted in Dvorak
winning 6-4, 6-0.

Last month in the K-Swiss Christmas Bowl, Cercone beat Dvorak for the 12 title
6-3, 6-2.

Other area winners were Morgan Frank (girls 14) and Kara Kucin (10). Finalists
were Phillip Navikov (10) and George Navas (16). Consolation winners were Melisa
Smith (10), Lauren Saltiel (14), Garrett Betsarakis (10) and Keegan Smith (12).

ADULTS MEET: A captains' meeting for the upcoming USA League Tennis adult
division begins at 6:30 p.m. Thursday at the Bardmoor Golf and Tennis Club in
Largo.

Information on Tennis Link, reporting scores, 2002 league rule changes and
players' requirements will be among issues discussed.

For questions, contact women's coordinator Carol Levin, (727) 797-8416, or men's

SPORTS WORLD SPECIALS;
Eye Doctors' Advice

BYLINE: By Steven Crist

SECTION: Section C; Page 2, Column 1; Sports Desk

LENGTH: 479 words


The surging popularity of racquetball, and the continuing appeal of other
four-wall sports like squash and handball, have been accompanied by an alarming
number of eye injuries. One of the people most concerned about the phenomenon is
Benjamin Milder, an associate professor of ophthalmology at the Washington
University School of Medicine in St. Louis. He and C.A. (Dewey) Morehouse of the
Sports Research Institute at Penn State University will discuss the epidemic of
eye injuries during the national conference of the National Society to Prevent
Blindness at the Statler Hotel on Sept. 23.

''It's not surprising that there should be a injuries to the eye and face in
racquetball,'' he said. ''In doubles you have four people swinging racquets
within an area of about 20 by 40 feet and a ball whizzing around the court at
speeds of up to 140 miles an hour.  There are certainly inherent dangers of
being hit by either the ball or another player's racquet.''

Dr. Milder said it would be impossible to estimate accurately the total number
of eye injuries that occur in racquet sports during a year, but he hazarded a
guess of ''more than 20,000.'' He said he had heard other estimates that ranged
up to 70,000.

He mentioned the Spaulding Racquet Club, which has 35 clubs in the East and
Midwest with a total membership of about 75,000.  ''They estimate about 10
injuries per club per month,'' he said.  ''And about half of those injuries are
to the eyes and face. Most of those, fortunately, are of a minor nature, but not
all. Almost all of them could be prevented by eye protectors, which are now
mandatory at Spaulding Clubs for players 16 years or younger. Voluntary
compliance by adults is about 50 percent.''

Dr. Milder also spoke of the St. Louis Jewish Community Center, with 20
racquetball courts and eight squash courts.  ''In 1973 there were 150 injuries
around the eye and face from racquet sports,'' he said. ''They decided it was
carnage, unreasonable and untenable. They began an educational program about
such injuries, and in 1975 passed a regulation that everyone who went on a court
was required to wear eye protectors. The program was monitored and enforced. In
the first year, the number of eye injuries dropped from 150 to three. The point
was well made.''

Dr. Milder said that most eye protection - goggles with unshatterable plastic
lenses or safety glasses - can be easily obtained in sporting-goods stores or at
clubs.

''I'm noting more interest at community and university athletic facilities and
at many clubs in the private sector,'' he said. ''The idea of eye protection is
starting to take hold around the country.''

And With Tiger's Golf Clubs You'd Win the Masters ...

BYLINE: By PAUL BERGER

SECTION: Section G; Column 0; Style Desk; FITNESS; Pg. 6

LENGTH: 1202 words


AT a time when your iPhone case says as much about you as the music you choose
to upload, no two officemates  have the same Google home page and no true
sneakerhead would be without customized kicks, it is perhaps inevitable that the
thirst for personalization has seeped into  amateur sport.

Cyclists can spend three years' worth of vacation money on custom-built bikes
while golfers spend hours agonizing over the perfect shaft as if they were being
fitted for an Oscar-ready bespoke suit. Now it is the turn of tennis, where
players for whom mass market just won't do can take their $200 or $300 rackets
to a customizer.

One part math, two parts physics, customization promises to transform an
everyday racket into the perfect tennis machine by altering its weight, balance
or  swing weight (a combination of the weight and the balance), for about $50 a
racket. For hundreds of dollars, sometimes thousands,  a professional will
pinpoint which adjustments are necessary for your game.

Cristovao Franza, 22, the assistant director of tennis at St. Andrew's School in
Boca Raton, Fla., said tennis has been a big part of his life since he was 7. He
spends about six hours a day on court either teaching or training for
competitions. Four years ago, he  had four Head Liquidmetal Radical rackets
customized for about $60 each, and another three rackets custom built.

''It's all about confidence,'' Mr. Franza said. ''With the racket the way it was
when I bought it in the store, I didn't have the confidence to hit certain
shots.'' He chose the Head Radical because it was used by his idol, Andre Agassi
(whose  two-handed backhand is a model for   Mr. Franza's). But the racket was
so light it was hard to control, the rounded grip did not quite match his hand
and the shaft was too short.

Now, Mr. Franza said, if he hits shots correctly he knows the ball will go where
he wants. ''I am playing the best tennis of my life,'' he said.

Once the preserve of professional tennis players, racket customization is
beginning to catch on among dedicated amateurs who have heard about it in the
media or online, where racket customizers -- whose ranks have been growing in
recent years -- are easy to find.  The message boards of sites  like
tennis-warehouse.com buzz with chatter about  grip size, racket weight and
balance.

People who customize are typically the most ardent amateurs,  playing at least
three times a week in leagues or tournaments.  Chip Brenn of Sandia Racquet
Services in New Mexico says they are often more obsessed with racket
diagnostics  than professionals are. ''A pro knows what they like and they are
not going to change,'' he said. ''But recreational players are a lot more
interested in tinkering.''

The precise number of amateurs who have turned to customization is hard to pin
down, but they represent a small number of  tennis players.  About 24.5 million
Americans played tennis in 2006, according to the Tennis Industry Association,
with just over 5 million of those playing 20 or more times. Tennis retailers say
less than 10 percent of consumers request customization, while customizers
themselves admit the numbers are fairly small.

''If you told me there were 20,000 people out there who have had their racket
customized, I would be very impressed,'' Mr. Brenn said. Still, he  stopped
advertising nationwide because he couldn't meet demand.

In Mr. Franza's drive to hone his game, he turned to Warren Bosworth, 72, a
customizer in Boca Raton who has been tweaking rackets for over 30 years. Mr.
Bosworth added weight to the heads for greater control, elongated the grips and
gave the grip edges more definition. At no extra cost, he  personalized the butt
caps: ''Custom built by Bosworth for Cristovao Franza.''

Many amateurs already dabble in customization themselves, increasing the mass of
their racket by adding lead tape to the head or handle. Laurence Shanet, 41, a
television and theater director, was among the self-customizers until recently,
when he turned to Roman Prokes of RPNY Tennis in New York, because ''you can't
really get a good machine that measures weight, balance and swing weight for
less than $5,000 or $6,000.''

''Tennis is incredibly frustrating,'' said Mr. Shanet, a former junior and
college tennis player, who now plays once a week at most, ''and so the equipment
is one of those areas where you can look for an edge.''

Bob Patterson of Racquetmaxx in Alabama said ''people are talking more about
customizing rackets,'' and that 80 percent of his business is now  from amateur
players, compared with 10 percent a few years ago. Tim Strawn, a racket stringer
and the founder of www.grandslamstringers.com, said the Internet has been a huge
factor. ''Ten years ago people didn't even know these services were available,''
Mr. Strawn said.

But David Bone, executive director of the United States Racquet Stringers
Association, attributed the increase to a push from customizers, who advertise
actively online and in stores. More of his association's members are moving into
customization, he said, and more amateurs are being persuaded to use those
services.

But does it all matter to their game? Billy Martin, the coach of the University
of California, Los Angeles,  men's tennis team and a former Wimbledon
quarterfinalist, said it probably benefited only the most proficient players.
''Everybody wants to play with what the pros play with,'' Mr. Martin said. ''But
for the average Joe, I don't think it makes much difference.''

Most tennis enthusiasts know that professionals' rackets are customized to such
an extent that though they look the same as store-bought rackets, technically
they are worlds apart. These amateurs are demanding the same level of service,
but their desire does not always match their ability.

Donald Cline, the  tennis and golf buyer at Paragon Sports in New York, said a
75-year-old man came into the store requesting ''Federer's racket strung with
Federer's string.''

''The sales guy had to tell him, 'First of all, you can barely lift that racket
,''' Mr. Cline said. ''And if you use this string, your arm is going to fall off
because it will hurt so much.''

Because mass-produced rackets vary slightly in weight and balance, one of the
most common customization requests by amateurs is racket matching, said Don
Hightower, the president of the online retailer Tennis Warehouse. Players want
to be sure, he said, that if they pop a string on one racket they have a bag of
identical ones in reserve.

Popping strings is one problem. But lifelong tennis players sometimes find that
it is their bodies that wear out.  John Alper, a 55-year-old director of TV
commercials and documentaries, travels a lot  for work, but when he is home in
Florida he plays four times a week, and he  plays to win.

But Mr. Alper found his Wilson Pro Staff racket starting to become a little too
heavy. After trying a few customized rackets, Mr. Alper bought a custom-built
Bosworth racket instead. He says customization is still relatively unknown at
his tennis club, but he won't be helping to spread the word. ''I am usually a
very generous guy,'' he said. ''But in tennis I want every advantage I can
get.''

Action rolls to easy win over Racquets

DATELINE: SAN ANTONIO



The Tampa Bay Action breezed to an easy 26-20 victory over the San Antonio
Racquets on Sunday night at McFarlin Tennis Center in a showdown for second
place in the Eastern Division of World TeamTennis.

    The win, in front of 1,410 fans, improves Tampa Bay's record to 9-5 and ties
the Action for second place in the Eastern Division with San Antonio. The loss
also snaps the Racquets' three-match winning streak.

    Because the Action has beaten the Racquets in two of three matches this
season, it wins second place and collects $ 3,500 per player. San Antonio
finishes in third place and receives $ 2,500 per player.

    Originally, the winner of Sunday's match was going to host Tuesday night's
divisional semifinal. But Tampa Bay defaulted because the Tampa Bay Convention
Center already is booked for Tuesday.

    The winner of Tuesday's match travels to champion Atlanta on Thursday for
the Eastern Division final.

    "I'm really happy because the last four or five months we have told
everybody we have a great team," Tampa Bay coach Bobby Blair said. "We're
looking forward to playing San Antonio again Tuesday and going to Atlanta and
knocking the Thunder off."

    Tampa Bay seemed more aggressive than San Antonio throughout Sunday's match.
In defense of the Racquets, it was their third match in four days.

    San Antonio jumped out to a quick 6-2 lead behind the mixed-doubles team of
Ginger Helgeson and Trevor Kronemann.  Tampa Bay's Jill Hetherington and Tobias
Svantesson could not handle the powerful serves of Kronemann.

    The Action's Mikael Pernfors cut the deficit to 10-8 with a hard-fought 6-4
win over the Racquets' Jean Philippe Fleurian.

    Tampa Bay took the lead for good with a convincing 6-2 win in mixed doubles
to put it in front 14-12. The tandem of Kathy Rinaldi and Hetherington, the No.
3 doubles team in the world, was too much for San Antonio's Louise Allen and
Helgeson.

    Rinaldi increased Tampa Bay's advantage to 20-16 going into men's doubles
with a 6-4 victory over Helgeson. Pernfors and Svantesson followed with a tough
6-4 win over Fleurian and Kronemann.

Worry for title challengers; Squash Rackets

BYLINE: COLIN MCQUILLAN

SECTION: Issue 63611.

LENGTH: 503 words


Village Leisure Hotels, the early-season surprise leaders of the Pimm's Premier
League, last night forced themselves back into contention by beating Weir
Systems Surrey 4-1 in Manchester, but must worry about the form of their
Australian first string, Rodney Eyles, for vital matches over the next three
weeks.

Thanks to a workmanlike squad astutely selected and prepared by John Le Livre,
the Village Hyde resident professional, Village Leisure moved back into second
position, ahead of UTC Cannons, thanks once more to their lower-order strength.


The merit order of the Squash Rackets Association commands team order in the
league, and for the Manchester side that means that the former national
champion, Geoff Williams, appears at fifth string. Last night he defeated the
Weir Systems captain, Tim Garner, 9-3, 9-3, 9-0.

Above him, Phil Whitlock defeated Jonathen Lilley, 9-3, 9-3, 9-2, at second
string, John Ransome beat Luke Gojnic, 9-0, 9-5, 9-0, at third string and
Matthew Oxley overcame Mike Perry, 9-5, 9-3, 7-9, 9-0, at fourth string.

Le Livre was looking for a 5-0 victory to close the gap on Leeks Welsh Wizards,
who routed Allsports Northern last night at St Mellon's Country Club, Cardiff.
But Eyles, the world No. 12, went down unexpectedly to Nigel Stiles at first
string.

Stiles, ranked 29th on the England list, is better known as a doubles
specialist, but is a knowledgable competitor who has played in the Cannons lower
order in past seasons.

'Rodney has got himself wound up tight at the moment and is not even moving
properly on court, ' Le Livre said.

'Last week he lost to Brett Martin in the league and before that he lost in the
first round of the World Young Masters to Colin Keith, our own reserve player.

'I have another foreign player registered, Stuart Hailstone, of Australia, who
has been a stalwart for us in the past. I have to think about the best
long-range strategy against Northern, Cannons and Wizards over the next three
weeks.

'We can still win this title, but do I hope Eyles will work his way out of
trouble, or do I fly in Hailstone hoping he can hit league form immediately?'

Adopting the South African route could destroy the whole balance of the team. At
present, Phil Whitlock, the village second string, is ranked above Hailstone at
24 on the world list and would have to play at first string if that were
reflected on the SRA merit order.

'There are times when the merit order drives you crazy, ' Le Livre said. 'Having
the strength of Williams at fifth string is great. But not being able to include
a player as hot as Colin Keith, who could make third string in this line-up, is
just infuriating.'

RESULTS: Village Leisure Hotels 4, Weir Systems Surrey 1 (R Eyles lost to N
Stiles, 9-3, 7-9, 7-9, 9-2, 7-9; J Ransome bt L Gojnic, 9-0, 9-5, 9-0; M Oxley

4 EX-MANAGERS SUE NORTHWEST RACQUET

BYLINE: BYLINE: Scott Carlson, Staff Writer

SECTION: BUSINESS TWIN CITIES; LITIGATION; Pg. 2D

LENGTH: 423 words


Four women are suing Northwest Racquet Swim and Fitness Health Clubs for age and
sex discrimination, alleging they lost their jobs as club managers last fall to
younger men who are now earning far more than what they were paid.

In a complaint filed Wednesday in federal court in St. Paul, one woman alleges
she was fired for insufficient cause while the other three claim they were let
go as part of a management reorganization at the Twin Cities' largest health
club operator.

The four women, who say that among them they managed about half of the company's
13 Twin Cities racquet and swim clubs, are seeking unspecified back wages and
punitive damages.

St. Louis Park-based Northwest Racquet, which has about 100,000 members, on
Thursday contended the lawsuit is groundless.

"We totally restructured the company and evaluated every manager we had," said
Mark Ratner, Northwest Racquet president. "We picked people who we felt were
most competent," and the final selections included three women and one minority,
he said.

Ratner said current club managers make more money than the four women did when
they were employed with Northwest because the company dramatically increased
duties of managers under the restructuring.

"We feel we are in full compliance with the law," Ratner said. He added that
Northwest Racquet offered the women "other opportunities" in the company but
they declined.

The plaintiffs are Ruth Behn, 61, who at the time of her termination was manager
of Northwest's Moore Lake club in Fridley; Susan Dvorak, 48, former manager of
the 98th Street club in Bloomington; Marnie Gallagher, 43, former manager of
four Northwest clubs; and Leah Pierce, 34, who was manager of the Highway 100
club in Brooklyn Center.

Of the four women, Gallagher had the longest tenure with Northwest, starting as
receptionist in 1975. Other positions she held included head day-care
coordinator. From August 1993 until her dismissal, Gallagher was manager of the
Normandale, Southdale, Richfield and Midwest racquet clubs, receiving an annual
salary of about $20,500, the lawsuit alleges.

The other women's service with Northwest ranged from one year for Pierce to 10
and 11 years for Dvorak and Behn, respectively.

The lawsuit says that Northwest Racquet fired Behn without warning after she
allegedly told a maintenance manager she was upset because the company didn't
give her authorization to replace bulbs in tanning beds. The suit also contends
the other women had received positive job evaluations.

SENIOR TEAM COMPETES IN N. CAROLINA;
CLAWS AND PAWS INVOLVED THROUGHOUT THE SOUTHEAST

BYLINE: By Billy Byler Staff Writer

SECTION: NEWS TIMES; Pg. O13

LENGTH: 293 words


A local group of tennis players from the Petersburg Racquet Club has long been
competitive in tennis. The players had more than enough experience in winning
and losing on the tennis court.

They're all more than 50 years old.

They call themselves the Claws and Paws. They're a senior mixed doubles tennis
team from the Petersburg Racquet Club, but they play all over the Southeast.
They're serious about their tennis.

The team is currently in Cary, N.C., as representatives from Georgia in the
Southern Sectional Mixed Doubles Championships.

The group, made up of team captain Don Murphree, co-captain Yvonne Harrison,
Larry Bailey, Gregg Jennings, Donnalene Pullen, Richard Pullen, Mary Jane
Rekito, Jim Spangler and Joan Steinberg, has already come a long way.

Paws and Claws went undefeated as a team at the Georgia State Senior 6.0 Mixed
Doubles Championships in August. The seniors battled other teams from around the
state and fought through summer temperatures up to 99 degrees to win the
tournament by one match in Rome.

This weekend, the squad will face teams from eight other states in the Southern
Sectionals in North Carolina.

While most seniors called it quits on competitive sports years ago, the Claws
and Paws crew said the competition helps them stay fit.

"Most of them realize it is good for their health," Murphree said. "If you don't
get out there and motivate yourself and move your body, you won't have as much
fun."

Though staying healthy and having fun are positive by-products of playing,
Murphree said there's no doubt that these seniors are playing with a competitive
drive.

"With this group the idea is to try to win these tournaments," Murphree said.
"To me, that's a motivating thing when you play on teams. I'm looking to compete
and to win."

PLAYERS BECOME RETAILERS;
THE STORE'S OWNERS SAY THE GAME IS A PASSION, AND THEY WANTED TO FILL A NICHE.;

"Peter and I have always played tennis," Bill Dermody said about a passion he
and his son both enjoy. "We talked for years about how there wasn't a tennis
shop, and finding a good pair of tennis shoes in Madison was difficult."

There were golf stores, bike shops, swimwear stores, but nothing specifically
for tennis in the Madison area.

The Dermodys decided to fill the niche when they opened The Tennis Shop, 743 N.
High Point Road, in November. Bill Dermody's wife, Sarah, serves as the buyer
and does the merchandising in the store.

Peter Dermody is the general manager and his father is the president of the
company while continuing to work his information technology sales job.

The shop carries more than 50 models of adult racquets and several for children.

The shop offers a demonstration program that lets customers check out racquets
for a fee of $5 per racquet for two days. "If the customer decides to purchase a
racquet from us, we credit the service fee, up to $20, to the purchase price,"
Bill Dermody said.

Racquets are strung in-house using a variety of polyester, multifilament and
natural gut strings.

The shop provides a one-day turnaround on stringing seven days a week using
electronic stringing technology so the tension is accurate and consistent every
time.

Tennis apparel, accessories and shoes also are sold in the shop.

Bill Dermody started playing tennis in his 20s but really took up the game later
in life. "It's fun to be able to share the sport with my son," he said.

Peter Dermody played tennis at Madison West High School and has taught tennis
since 2004 at local summer clubs and Greater Madison Tennis Association
programs. In 2006 and 2007, he coached boys tennis at Monona Grove High School.

Since 2006, he has been the girls varsity tennis coach at West High.

"I love coaching," Peter Dermody said. "One of the main appeals to owning a
tennis shop is that it allows me control of my schedule, and I can keep coaching
in addition to working at the shop."

Get a handle on the tennis racket to suit your needs

BYLINE: DANA SCARTON; SCRIPPS HOWARD NEWS SERVICE

SECTION: SPORTS PLUS; FITNESS/RECREATION; Pg. C6


Shopping for a tennis racket can be more challenging than playing a few sets
against your local pro.

"Yeah, right," you say.

But a visit to your local sports store or tennis pro shop is likely to convince
you. The choices are overwhelming. And so are the $ 100-plus price tags.

Some rackets have big heads, some small heads. Some are heavy and some light.

There are rackets made from graphite and rackets made from fiberglass. There are
stiff rackets and flexible rackets.

Is your head spinning yet?

If it is, that's understandable. Unless you enter a store with a checklist of
what you need, you could end up buying the wrong racket.

But before you compose your list, you need to assess your game. Determine your
strengths and weaknesses. Are you a player who hits with power? Are you seeking
more control? Do you experience arm problems after playing?

Such determinations are important because your objective is to select a racket
that suits you and your style of play. Once you've described your style of play,
use these guidelines to help you compose your checklist.

THE GRIP:

This could be the most important part of buying a racket -- finding one with the
right grip. We're talking size here. Grips come in different sizes and it's
crucial to find one that fits your hand. Selecting a racket with a grip that is
too small can prompt you to hold the racket too tightly and that, in turn, can
trigger elbow problems.

Ask a tennis pro in your area to help you determine your grip size.

THE HEAD SIZE:

Generally, rackets are categorized as standard, midsized or oversized. The terms
refer to the size of the head.

The standards are the dinosaurs of tennis rackets. Virtually no one uses them
anymore. Standards have the smallest heads. Most wooden rackets were standards.

Midsized rackets have a larger head than standards, but the surface area does
not exceed 100 square inches. The head area on over-sized rackets exceeds 100
square inches.

"Many players like oversized rackets because you can hit an off-center hit with
less arm vibration and you can get more power," said Susan Hahn, public
information specialist with the United States Tennis Association in Princeton,
N.J.

THE FRAME WIDTH:

Wide bodies are the still the rage in tennis. A wide body is a racket with a
large frame width. The wider racket enables players to hit the ball with more
power.

Women players are especially fond of wide bodies because the rackets provide
more power on shots. But be careful. Some people find that super-wide bodies are
awkward and adjusting to it is difficult.

THE FLEXIBILITY:

Racket flexibility determines how hard a ball can be hit. Stiff rackets enable
players to hit the ball harder; flexible rackets generally result in softer
hits.

Buying a racket that's too stiff, however, can cause problems for players who
experience tennis elbow or other arm problems. It's best to select a racket that
falls in the middle of the flexibility-stiffness scale.

By now, you should be on your way to developing a checklist that suits your
tennis needs. Here are a few general shopping tips to help you get the most for
your money:

-- Test a racket before you buy it.

Many stores have "demo rackets." Basically, these are rackets that you are
permitted to take with you to test on the court.

"Although it can be tedious, this is really the best way," Hahn said. "It's too
risky to just buy a racket on speculation.

"Try to figure out the five rackets that you would be interested in. Maybe you
could determine this from just holding them in the store. Then try to demo each
of them."

-- Borrow a friend's racket.

If someone you know is playing with a racket that looks interesting to you, ask
to swap rackets for a few minutes, or even a few games. You'll be able to form a
quick opinion of the racket and whether it suits your game. And your friend
might enjoy the experiment, too.

-- Read specialty magazines. Tennis Magazine publishes a thorough racket review
every spring. If you missed this year's issue, contact your local library.

Duo has guts with strings attached

DATELINE: ST. PETERSBURG; PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti; TAMPA



Whether France or the United States wins the first-round match at the  Bayfront
Center, the winner will have Kim Cashman and Kathi Marrero to thank.

Well, sort of.

Cashman and Marrero, who work at Advantage Yours tennis shop in Clearwater,  are
the official racket stringers for the Davis Cup players. And while that  may
sound insignificant, the players say they are particular about their  racket
strings.

For instance, the players have been testing various string tensions all  week.
French pro Arnaud Boetsch has three rackets, and each is strung at a  different
tension. He chooses which one to use depending on whether he's  playing doubles,
singles or just warming up.

Players use gut strings, which cost about $ 50 per string. U.S. player Todd
Martin has his rackets strung the tightest (70 pounds), and French pros Oliver
Delaitre and Boetsch have their rackets strung at the lowest tension (54.5
pounds).

"You have to be real careful with gut," Marrero said. "We wash our hands  before
every string job to make sure we don't get any oil or dirt on the  strings while
we're working."

By the time the competition ends Sunday, Cashman and Marrero estimate they  will
have strung between 60 and 75 rackets.

"It's pretty fun," Cashman said. "When I worked the Davis Cup final at  the
(ThunderDome in 1990) I was stringing rackets from 4 o'clock to midnight  every
night."

Mac the critic

   In the latest edition of Tennis magazine, John McEnroe criticizes today's
top American pros for not always playing Davis Cup. For the first-round match
between the United States and France, top-ranked Pete Sampras and  second-ranked
Andre Agassi, who have played Davis Cup in the past, declined to  play.

"(Pete) Sampras says he's too busy (this) year to play, and I don't  understand
where that's coming from. How about not playing Palm Springs this  year?"
McEnroe said. "Doesn't anybody care about representing his country  anymore? Get
with the program. The things that count in tennis are the Grand  Slam events,
Davis Cup and the Olympics. The less they shine, the more tennis  becomes
irrelevant to most people."

Timing is everything

   The dates for the Cup first rounds will be changed next year if Russ Cline
has anything to say about it.

Cline, who is promoting the U.S.-France match, said the present date, which  was
changed this year from late March, conflicts with the Super Bowl and the
Australian Open finals. Both took place this past weekend.

"It's an extremely difficult date to sell an event," Cline said. "The
(International Tennis Federation) really needs to redo the date."

A comeback for Haiti

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti - For Canada's team, Haiti was an impoverished land
filled with American soldiers trying to rid the streets of paramilitary hoods.

"We were quite concerned," said Canadian player Grant Connell, ranked No.  7 in
doubles. "(But) we've been to so many countries that are poor, this is  as nice
as any of them."

Canada's four-player team opens first-round play today against Haiti in the
capital Port-au-Prince.

French connection

   The French are known as great lovers. According to a 1993 study by French
epidemiologists, French men reported they fall in love 4.5 times in their
lifetime, while French women fall in love three times. The study also said
French people make love, on average, seven to eight times a month.

Comparing the court surfaces

1 Clay court - The ball tends to "bite" when it hits the court and takes an
unusually high bounce.

2 Hard court - The bounce is said to be "true" because the ball bounces
cleanly.

3 Indoor carpet - The ball skids somewhat when it hits the court surface, thus
bounces low.

4 Grass court - The ball skids noticeably when it hits the court surface,  which
causes the ball to bounce very low.

SPORTS ACTIVE: THE ROUTINE: KEEP YOUR EYE ON THE BALL... OR ELSE';
  JONATHAN LARKEN, NO 2 RACKETS PLAYER IN THE WORLD Fast and furious: rackets
requires power and stamina, not to mention courage BRIAN DOWLING

SECTION: SPORT; Pg. 22

LENGTH: 538 words


Jonathan Larken is a 30-year-old living in New York and a leading figure in the
sport of rackets. Having taken up the game while at Eton College on the advice
of his father, he progressed to the final of the British Championships in
1990-91. He is ranked number two in the world, having won all the major singles
titles in America in 2002. He is soon to challenge the current world champion,
James Male, who has held that position for 13 of the last 14 years.

How would you explain rackets to those unfamiliar with the game?

It is really an extension of squash played on a court 60ft by 30ft made from
slate. Rather than the rubber squash ball, the rackets ball is made from
fibreglass. It looks, feels and bounces just like a table football. We play with
long handled, tightly strung rackets that propel the ball up to 140 miles per
hour. The rules are the same as in squash. You can only win points on your serve
and a game is won when a player gets to 15 points.

It sounds fairly dangerous...

It is dangerous, especially when playing doubles. Eye protection is worn and the
players can ask the referee for a let during play so that the chances of hitting
the opponent are reduced. If you are hit in the head by a ball travelling at
full speed, then the consequences are potentially fatal. We all have to be aware
of positioning on the court and will ask for a let rather than take a swipe if
the opponent is between the front wall and the ball.

When did you start playing rackets?

I started at Eton when I was 13 because my father advised me to give it a go;
his advice was, "Whatever you do, go and find a racket sport and you will have a
good time playing it." There are some professionals teaching at the 14 schools
in England and the 10 clubs in the UK and US.

How much does a rackets match demand physically?

The World Championship, for example, is a best-of-seven games match that could
take up to two and a half hours. There are gaps of 45 seconds between points so
it is not constant sprinting, but you have to be able to go hard for a long
period of time. It demands short-term explosive power and stamina.

What training have you been able to do?

Working in an investment bank has limited my time but since August I have
trained daily during my lunch break. The routine is similar to a footballer's
warm-up. It's an aerobic exercise programme, moving around the court every way I
can. It's designed to increase the strength in my quadriceps and improve my
breathing patterns.

What about improving your reactions?

I stand close in to one of the walls on the court and my coach hurls a rackets
ball over my shoulder. I have to turn and catch it with my right hand. To
challenge my speed around the court, I often play two against one.

How do you manage to stay calm under pressure?

I believe that mental tuning is as important as the physical training. I've been
focusing on the challenge. I think I'm ready.

Championships at Queen's Club, London, on Saturday 18 January. For tickets: 020

Rose is hounded while government pushes gambling

BYLINE: Russell Baker

SECTION: EDITORIAL; Columns; Pg. 11A

LENGTH: 807 words



Baseball's rules against gambling seem quaint in a country where    government
muscle has taken over the gambling rackets from the Mafia.

     Pete Rose, the Cincinnati nonpareil whose baseball career is now
threatened with ruin because of these rules, has not so far indicted    all
society for hypocrisy in this business, preferring to place his    destiny in
the briefcases of lawyers, a breed not given to passionate    articulations
about the moral decline of great nations.

     Being lawyers, they are reducing this great issue to a quarrel    about the
distinction between a tittle and a jot. What a pity. It would    be lovely to
see Rose rise up with the fury of a Zola and deliver a    Cincinnati "J'accuse"
against a terrible conspiracy to corrupt the    people of the great Republic.

     Yes, he might concede, involvement with gamblers was certainly a
despicable offense in 1919, the year that begat baseball's hatred of
gambling.

     Gambling was then a criminal industry operated by bad people. For
ballplayers to put themselves at the mercy of these gangsters, as the    Chicago
White Sox did during the 1919 World Series, was unforgivable    and criminal.

     That their employer was famous for cheapness and treated his    players
like sweatshop labor in no way diminished their offense.

     American views of morality have changed mightily since then,    however,
and particularly the view of gambling. Gambling, a vileness of    racketeers in
1919, is now as American as a Treasury deficit.

     Many states, seeing it as a way to fill their treasury vaults, have
taken over the old numbers racket from the Mafia and operate highly
publicized lotteries.

     These schemes bilk the suckers - or the citizens, as governmental    Nice
Nellies prefer to call them - with teasing promises of      multimillion-dollar
prizes.

     The most innocent babe living in a state running one of these    rackets is
exposed daily to government advertising aimed at making    gamblers of the
entire population.

     Tobacco companies cannot advertise cigarettes because forces of    uplift
have determined, probably rightly, that cigarettes are bad for    you and that
the power of television should not be exerted against    youthful or dumb or
innocent people to addict them to the weed.

     Nobody seems to mind, though, that governments use television to    hook
them on gambling.

     Government's love affair with gambling is not limited to passionate
promotion of the numbers racket. In New York, with its OTB    horse-betting
parlors, we have the state taking over the horse-betting    racket from your old
neighborhood bookie and his Mafia backers.

     How about those commercials for the casinos in Atlantic City? Here    we
have one of the East Coast's most highfalutin, Republican,    sober-side states,
New Jersey, endorsing casino gambling as good public    policy.

     And flooding television screens with commercials preaching the    good,
clean seaside fun of gambling in most of its forms.

     Shall we move on to Las Vegas, Reno, the entire state of Nevada, a    state
where gambling is not just a delightful source of revenue but    also an
honored, traditional way of life?

     Since 1919 there has been a complete reversal of the national    attitude
toward gambling. Once immoral, sinful, criminal, it now enjoys    moral sanctity
bestowed by its power to raise government revenues.

     There is big money in gambling. Why should government let crooks    collect
it when government can grab the lion's share by declaring    old-fashioned
rackets to be new-fangled, perfectly legal,    revenue-enhancing, public-policy
programs?

     Since about the time baseball began abandoning its traditional    towns and
moving around the country in search of bigger and bigger    bucks, it has become
increasingly evident that in America nothing is    more important than money.
Nothing.

     Government people always knew the gambling passion could be a sweet
source of revenue, but until after World War II some moral delicacy in    the
electorate restrained the politicians' urge to legalize it.

     Once we all concurred that there was nothing more important than    money,
absolutely nothing, our leaders helped us put 1919 with its    musty old moral
considerations out of mind.

     The decay is now so advanced that governments are trying to make
gambling addicts of us all. Yet baseball's moralists profess shock    about Pete
Rose. What hypocrisy. What rot.

SPORTING GEAR;
Angled-Arc Tennis Racquet

BYLINE: By S. Lee Kanner

SECTION: Section C; Page 10, Column 5; Sports Desk

LENGTH: 432 words


The first aluminum racquet introduced by Snauwaert of Belgium, manufacturers of
wood and wood-composite models, is 20 percent oversized and features a new
angled-arc head shape. The design has altered the normal arc in the upper
portion of the racquet's head to create a new shape consisting of four corners
connected with three nearly straight lines. The lower portion of the head is
unchanged, so that Snauwaert's stringing pattern of 16 main strings and 18 cross
strings can still be utilized. Snauwaert believes the angled-arc shape helps the
average player's stability and power. Other features of the aluminum model
include a stiffer yoke for shock absorption and a new, more pliable Zytel ST
string strip that allows strings to set properly. The Snauwaert Aluminum racquet
is available in different sizes and sells for $75, unstrung, at Feron's Racquet
and Tennis Shop, 55 East 44th Street, New York, N.Y. 10017, telephone (212)
867-6350.

Racquet Club men 4th in national tourney

BYLINE: NANCY MORGAN

SECTION: NEIGHBORHOOD TIMES; TENNIS; Pg. 22

LENGTH: 693 words



The 3.5 team wins several close matches to reach the semifinals of the USA Adult
League Tennis National Championships.

The Racquet Club of St. Petersburg completed its run toward a national men's
team championship last month with a fourth-place finish among 17 teams.

The club's 3.5 team of singles and doubles players traveled to Tucson, Ariz., to
compete among the nation's best within the U.S. Tennis Association's 17
sections. It was the first trip beyond regional competition for any of the 12
players.

"All of the matches were really close," said Scott Johnston, who played the No.
1 doubles position with Scott Stewart in each of the five matches at the USA
Adult League Tennis National Championships. "It was tough to get to nationals
and the competition was very even."

The club's first match in its flight was against a team from South Carolina.
John McQuillen won his No. 2 singles position in straight sets, but both
Johnston and Stewart in No. 1 and Jack Weldon and Earl Gehant in No. 3 needed
three to earn the team victory.

"After John won in singles and Scott and Scott won in doubles, we needed one
more doubles team to win over South Carolina," said captain Bob Dickerson.
"Steve Uebel and I lost a close one at No. 2 and Jack and Earl won in a
third-set tiebreaker. That's how close it was."

Against a team from Ohio, McQuillen in No. 2 singles, Mike Williams in No. 1,
and Johnston and Stewart in No. 1 doubles scored straight-set victories while
Weldon and Gehant rallied from a second-set loss to win in three sets at No. 3
for a 4-1 team score.

"Up until nationals, we as a team had only one other 3-2 team score," said
Johnston. "Our other wins had been either 4-1 or 5-0 - that shows how tough and
equal the competition was."

Williams in No. 1 singles and Johnston and Stewart in No. 1 doubles won again in
straight sets against a team from Maryland, with Dickerson and Uebel
contributing the third win at No. 2 doubles for the overall team victory.

"Both the team from Maryland and us were tied overall at 2-0 in flight
competition when we faced each other," said Dickerson. "Whoever won that would
go into the semifinal round. We're happy it was us, but it again was a close
match."

Winning all three flight matches advanced the Racquet Club to the semifinal
round with teams from Nevada, Texas and Hawaii.

Against Nevada, only Williams and McQuillen were able to win, forcing the
Racquet Club to a playoff for third place with Texas, which had fallen 5-0 to
Hawaii. The doubles teams of Johnston and Stewart in No. 1 and Weldon and Gehant
in No. 3 earned three-set victories against Texas, but the Texans scored three
wins for third place.

"This was definitely the experience of a lifetime and a great team experience,"
said Johnston. "I think everyone on our team played to their fullest of ability
and, looking back now, we're real happy."

Nevada, which handed the Racquet Club its first loss of the entire USA Adult
League season, went on to win the national championship with a 3-2 victory over
Hawaii.

TURVILLE WINS: Larry Turville, a son of St. Petersburg's Ed Turville, captured
the men's 50-and-over USTA Clay Court National Championship last month in a
32-player draw at the Bath and Racquet Club in Sarasota. In the final, the
top-seeded Turville defeated No. 2 seed Armistead Neely of Atlanta, Ga., 7-6
(9-7), 6-1.

In doubles, No. 2 Turville and partner Neal Newman of Columbus, Ohio, lost in a
semifinal match to eventual champions and third-seeded Barry Conway and Hugh
Thomson of Georgia.

Tom Grayson of Treasure Island and Anthony Ruggiero of St. Petersburg advanced
one round in the 32-team doubles draw.

THE ROCKET TO ARRIVE: Legendary tennis professional Rod Laver will participate
in a free clinic at the McMullen Tennis Complex in Clearwater from 10 a.m. to
noon Saturday. The clinic is sponsored by Pro Kennex, Advantage Yours Tennis and
Running, and the City of Clearwater Parks and Recreation Department.

After winning the first of 20 major titles at the age of 19 in 1957, Laver went
on to win Grand Slams in 1962 and 1969 and was unbeaten throughout the 1963
season.

FEDERER GIVES HIMSELF WAKE-UP CALL AT NASDAQ;
USUALLY CALM SWISS SMASHES HIS RACKET IN FRUSTRATION, THEN RALLIES TO BEAT NADAL
IN FIVE SETS

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. B02

LENGTH: 791 words


Roger Federer waited until late in the third set Sunday to unleash his most
forceful forehand, raising the racket and slamming it to the hardcourt at his
feet.

This was the winner of the ATP Tour sportsmanship award, on the ropes and
pitching a fit in the final of the Nasdaq-100 Open in Key Biscayne, Fla.

The outburst seemed to help. Twice two points from defeat, the top-ranked
Federer rallied for his fifth title this year, beating 18-year-old Rafael Nadal
2-6, 6-7 (4), 7-6 (5), 6-3, 6-1.

"I was missing one opportunity after the other," Federer said. "So I threw my
racket hard. Maybe it did me good, and I kind of woke up."

Federer, who won his 22nd straight match, had 74 unforced errors during the
3-hour, 43-minute marathon, but only 18 in the final two sets. When he shanked
an overhead to fall behind 5-4 in the third set, he slammed his racket to the
concrete -- a rarity for the serene Swiss.

"Of course it's surprising to see Federer throw his racket," Nadal said. "It
makes you think you're closer to victory, because he's frustrated."

Nadal was two points from the title in the next game and again in the third-set
tiebreaker before Federer won four straight points, the first on an 18-stroke
rally, to save the set. From there, Federer settled into his characteristic
groove.

"I just started to relax and took a freer swing at it," said Federer, who won
$533,350.

SUPER SHOW NOTEBOOK;
Former NFL cheerleaders sound off for lubricant

Gimme an L. Gimme a U. Gimme a B. Gimme an E.

Touting a lubricant for skate wheels isn't the same thrill as cheering for the
Raiders or Rams but what's a pompom girl from L.A. to do? When the two NFL teams
moved from Los Angeles, they stranded two cheerleading squads.

The women have survived as the California Fantasy Cheerleaders. This weekend,
four of them (Lisa, Melissa, Karen and Robin) have been at the Super Show on
behalf of Speed Skate Lube, signing posters and posing for Polaroids.

"We've got a lot more freedom now," Lisa said. "They wouldn't let us do things
like this. Would you like a poster?"

"I already got one," the show attendee said. "Just remember, you said you loved
me."

"I sign 'lots of love,' " Lisa said.
JUST THE SLEEVES

There are thousands of companies who want to sell T-shirts at the Super Show.
Fred Frey just wants to sell you the sleeves.

Sleeves is the name of his company that markets sleeves that go from wrist to
past the elbow and carry advertising or college logos.

"It's great for people who can't take too much sun or get chilly playing golf,
tennis or whatever."

He also makes sleeves with the Rolling Stones Voodoo Lounge logo, but Stone
Keith Richards doesn't want anyone but himself to wear them, so his order is
very exclusive.

THE DRY LOOK

Jimmy Sonoma ("I had the name before the Chevy truck did") was sitting in a
Tulipani portable hot tub getting some curious looks.

"This is the way you really should sell a spa," he said. "You sit in it without
the water to show the depth, sitting configuration, the positioning of the jets
and where they hit you."

PAM'S NEW RACKET

Pam Shriver was 16 in 1978 when she made it to the U.S. Open final using an
oversized Prince racket, a novelty at the time. She said she was the first to
play in a Grand Slam final with anything but a traditional racket.

"The oversized had a reputation of being for older players," she said,
surrounded by new rackets at the Yonex booth. "Like, if you couldn't see real
well, you needed this racket. I think my being in the final helped speed along
the process. I might have helped get that 'old player' label out of there."

The novelty today would be to find a racket with 1978's traditional- size head.

DAVIS SHARES GOLD

Three-time Olympic medalist swimmer Josh Davis was showing one of his three
golds won at the Atlanta Games at the Softub portable spa stand. "Ever hold an
Olympic gold medal?" he'd ask everyone who walked by. He said more than 100
people had handled the big gold coin Sunday.

"Probably 10,000 people have handled the medal in the last seven months," Davis
said. He's carried it to seven states. "I like to take it to schools and youth
groups and use it as a motivational thing. I'm not worried about it tarnishing.
It's 22-karat gold. If anything happens to it, the company that made it said
they'd re-dip it for me."

INSIDE LOCAL TENNIS;
Local officials to enforce ban on big Heads

BYLINE: Todd Holcomb

Officials from the Atlanta Lawn Tennis Association and USTA League Atlanta say
they will enforce a recent International Tennis Federation ruling that declared
illegal the nation's second best-selling racket, the titanium Head Ti.S7. The
racket's string bed exceeds the ITF's 15 1/2-inch limit.

"We're governed by the ITF, and the racket can't be used in USTA leagues," said
Mac MacDougal, the president of USTA League Atlanta and chairman of Georgia
Tennis Association's officials committee.

MacDougal said protests must be made before a match, adding, "A match played in
good faith stands as played."

ALTA is not bound by the U.S. Tennis Association's regulations but would follow
the USTA's stance in this case, according to office manager Rick Siebert. The
USTA has stated that its leagues and tournaments will abide by the ITF decision.

Neither ALTA nor USTA League Atlanta has received any official complaints.

All other Head rackets are legal, including the Ti.S6, which ranks No. 1 in
dollar sales since the introduction of Head's titanium line in October.

Meanwhile, Head is modifying the design of its titanium rackets to avert a
lawsuit filed by Wilson Sporting Goods, which claims that Head violated Wilson's
patent on Hammer technology. Head denied the charge but chose to avoid
litigation and said the changes won't significantly alter what are still the
lightest frames on the market.

Head has gained about a 10 percent market share in racket dollar sales this
year, mostly at the expense of Wilson. Head's titanium line is most popular
among B- and C-level players. Making it at Wimbledon Atlanta's Ansley Cargill
won a round in the Wimbledon junior girls draw this week before losing Wednesday
to Tina Pisnik of Slovenia, the world's second-ranked junior girls player, 7-6
(7-5), 6-2. Pisnik won the Orange Bowl last year. . . . Cargill and Jewel
Peterson of College Park received wild cards into the main singles draw of the
USTA Women's Challenger of Peachtree City next month. Southern champions Georgia
singles champions from last week's Southern Senior Hardcourt Open in Augusta

Senior teams advance to state tournament

BYLINE: NANCY MORGAN

SECTION: PASCO TIMES; TENNIS; Pg. 4

LENGTH: 755 words



While one team of Pasco and Pinellas players captured a 3.5 senior title to
advance to USA Tennis Florida's state competition, a second fell short of
qualifying.

Westin Innisbrook Resort's senior women clinched their USA League Tennis
division with a 3-0 win over Bardmoor Golf and Tennis Club last weekend. The
Phil Green Tennis Academy's senior men's team was eliminated 2-1 by defending
champion Racquet Club of St. Petersburg.

"We're excited, of course," Innisbrook captain Judy Murphy said. "It will be fun
to go to state again and try to qualify for nationals."

Innisbrook's Debbie McGinley and Maureen Sternberg in No. 1, Cheryl Cravener and
Reme Johnson in No. 2 and Josie Doucette and Anne Hammond in No. 3 were winners.

Rounding out the team are Joan Holland, Phyllis Gary, Sue Luidens, Bonny
Boosales, Kay Fitzpatrick and Murphy.

"McMullen was right behind us and we could have ended up tied in overall records
and individual games lost," Murphy said. "But our 3-0 win over Bardmoor and
their 3-0 loss to Countryside over the weekend took care of that possibility."

The Innisbrook squad was 11-0 and lost just four individual matches among a
possible 33.

The senior men's team, although unbeaten throughout the season, managed just one
individual win against the Racquet Club team. Ed McGinley and Skip Parker
rallied from a first-set loss to win in No. 3, 6-7 (5), 6-4, 6-2.

"I can't take anything away from them," PGTA captain Joe Gari said of the St.
Petersburg team. "They executed beautifully and I take my hat off to them. We
played all right, but they played better. We wish them all the luck at state."

Last year, the PGTA team, then based at Innisbrook, lost 2-1 to the Racquet Club
in the final playoff match. This year, the 2-1 loss was in the semifinal round.

Gari also serves as captain of a squad of super seniors who are currently in
first-place with a 5-0 team record in the north division among four teams.

"I wish we would be balancing playoffs in both the seniors and the super seniors
divisions," Gari said. "But now we'll just concentrate on the super seniors. I'm
comfortable with our lead now and we'll just see where it takes us."

Joining Gari on the super senior squad are Richard Hough, John Kuhn, Dick
Lashley, Bill Schieman, Glenn Merrer, Bob Berkstresser, Charles Hill, David
Wistsky and Willie Coquelet from the senior squad. Rounding out the team are
Woody Woodbury and Fred Elflein.

Super senior competition continues through mid-March when a playoff between the
north and south divisions will be scheduled. Currently, Shipwatch Tennis Club in
Largo leads the south division among five teams.

MORE SENIOR LEAGUE UPDATES: Treasure Island Tennis and Yacht Club clinched its
4.0 senior women's division, as did Timber Pines Tennis Club in the 3.0, and
will join Innisbrook at the state tournament in May.

Final matches in the senior men's playoffs this weekend include the Racquet Club
traveling to Royal Racquet Club in the 3.5 and the McMullen Tennis Center
playing at Seminole Lake Tennis Center in the 4.0. The winners qualify for the
state tournament.

MIXED LEAGUE UPDATES: With just two more weeks remaining in the USA Tennis
Florida mixed doubles leagues, the PGTA is first among the 8.5 senior teams and
Royal Racquet Club is unbeaten in the 7.5 senior division.

In the adult division, McMullen is 9-0 in the 8.5 while two Bardmoor teams are
challenging for first-place in the 7.5.

With no local competition, Innisbrook's 6.5 senior team automatically advances
to the state tournament.

NET NOTES: Among the finalists in last weekend's SPTC Adult Championships at the
St. Petersburg Tennis Center was No. 3 seed Daigo Sakurai in the men's open
singles division. Sakurai advanced to the final before falling 6-3, 6-4 to top
seed Ryan Rowe of Pompano Beach.

Alex Deeb, formerly of New Port Richey, reached the men's 45 singles final to
play No. 4 Ron Perry of Massachusetts. Deeb fell 2-6, 6-2, 6-2. Deeb then teamed
with Subir Mukerjee to win the 45 round-robin doubles competition.

COMING UP: The Top Gun Rookie II for junior singles competitors is this weekend
at the Arbor Greene Fitness and Athletic Club in Tampa. Call tournament director
Alan Williams, (813) 991-9741. The Arbor Super Series for juniors is at the
Arbor Greene site March 2-4. elip The Spring Adult Classic is March 1-3 at East
Lake Woodlands. Men's and women's singles and doubles in open competitions are
scheduled. Call tournament director Bob Butterfield, (727) 785-2212.

Doubles league teams preparing for playoffs

BYLINE: NANCY MORGAN

SECTION: NEIGHBORHOOD TIMES; TENNIS; Pg. 22

LENGTH: 813 words



The road to the state tournament is narrowing as playoffs begin Saturday in the
Senior Men's Doubles League.

The Racquet Club of St. Petersburg has two teams entered in the 3.5 playoffs.
The Renaissance Vinoy has one.

Rounding out the teams are Westin Innisbrook, Royal Racquet Club and Countryside
Country Club.

One Racquet Club team advanced to the playoffs by winning its division. A second
squad was forced to win its final regular season match to advance. The Vinoy
needed a victory in its finale.

Earning a first-place finish and an 8-2 overall record in the senior 3.5 south
division, the Racquet Club - with Marshall Craig the captain - will face
Countryside on Saturday in the first of three rounds to determine the overall
division winner.

Playing for the Racquet Club have been Don Campagne, Steve Uebel, Tony Damouny,
Ray Cianci, Tom Stewart, Vaughn Haight, Jack Weldon, Neel Voss and Andy McCloud.

A rain-postponed match between the Racquet Club and Innisbrook was played Monday
evening. The Racquet Club won 2-1 and advanced to Saturday's first playoff match
with a second Innisbrook team.

Clinching the Racquet Club's berth were Ron Whitaker and Nick Routh with a
straight-set victory at No. 1 and Tom Shevlin and Dave Farnsworth with a 6-3,
7-5 win  at No. 3. Captain Larry Sewall and Nick Pavonetti fought to a 7-6, 6-3
loss at No. 2.

The Vinoy defeated the first-place Racquet Club in the final match of the
regular season to secure its playoff spot against Royal Racquet Club.

In its 2-1 win, the Vinoy's Patrick Dines and Richard Graf won at No. 2. Norm
Ott and Don Mathias won at No. 3. Dick Finan and Jeff Szilagi fell 6-3, 6-4 to
Damouny and Uebel at No. 1.

  No playoffs were needed in the senior men's 4.0 division with Shipwatch Tennis
Club securing the division title and recording a 7-1 overall record.

In its final match last week with Seminole Lakes, Shipwatch's Scott Chambers and
Mike Carrigan at No. 1 and Wendell Walker andDoug Godinho at No. 2 defeated
Seminole challengers. Joh Beda and Tim Kahle fell in two sets to Seminole.

The senior women's doubles league competition continues through the end of the
month. All division winners advance to the state tournament, May 19-21 at a site
yet to be determined.

SUPER SENIORS: The women's 60-plus doubles league began Monday for four teams in
the 3.5 division.

Innisbrook won its first match 3-0 over Shipwatch Tennis Club, and Timber Pines
Tennis Club beat Bardmoor 2-1.

The 4.0 super senior team from Treasure Island Tennis and Yacht Club is
unchallenged and playing qualifying matches in the senior women's 4.0 division.
Timber Pines is in the senior 3.0.

In men's super senior action, an Innisbrook team with Joe Gari  as captain has
clinched Flight I in the 3.5 division and will face the Flight II winner. A win
Tuesday for the St. Petersburg Tennis Center team with Fred DeJohn would advance
the squad to the Feb. 27 playoff.

SPTC is in first place in its flight with a 4-0 record.

SOUTH PINELLAS: The South PInellas Ladies Doubles League enters its fourth week
of the spring session today.

Participating are two teams from St. Petersburg Country Club and the Vinoy and
one each from Feather Sound, Isla Del Sol, Seminole Lakes, St. Petersburg Tennis
Center and Treasure Island Recreation Center.

Through three weeks of competition, Treasure Island  is unbeaten in the two
doubles position format. Squad members are Sue Best, Linn Riffe, Robin Cain,
Karen Richnak, Gay Womack, Charlene Garner, Gill McDonnell, Barb Murray, Louise
Strong, Jean Simmons and Margaret Tseng.

MARATHON WINNER: Aniko Kapros, 17, of Hungary completed a streak of 14 wins to
earn her first professional tournament victory in the $ 25,000 USTA Women's
Challenger of Clearwater last week at McMullen Tennis Complex.

Kapros, the No. 2 junior in the world, won six matches in a pre-qualifying event
to reach the tournament.

Three more victories advanced Kapros to the 32-player main draw, in which she
upset third-seeded Dawn Buth of New York in the first round and No. 2 Alina
Jidkova of Russia in the final.

Buth is ranked 120th in the world, and Jidkova is 81st.

WORKSHOP: Area enthusiasts have an opportunity to learn more about USA Tennis

ROTARY CLUB RESULTS: Lynn Sayler and Margaret O'Grady finished first among seven
teams in the women's doubles round robin in the Bill Burnson Rotary Tennis
Doubles Tournament at Bardmoor Golf and Tennis Club last weekend.

teams. Ward Johansen and Ken Cherven were first in the 4.0 among eight squads.

Dishwasher complaint comes out in the wash

BYLINE: By CAROL ELLIOTT; Tribune Columnist

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. B1; ACTION LINE

LENGTH: 745 words


Please help me save $70.95. In March 2003, I purchased a Maytag dishwasher. It
worked quietly, and since it was an energy-efficient appliance, I programmed it
to operate between 12 and 2 a.m. One day, I received a notice from Maytag that
the dishwasher required the replacement of a drain hose. In August 2003, Bob's
Repair Service in South Bend did the replacement. I returned to operating it
during energy-efficient hours, never giving it another thought.

During the holidays, some friends who were visiting noticed the machine made a
racket. I called Bob's. The serviceman changed the drain pump and suggested
nothing should touch the drain hose. Several months later, I operated the
dishwasher during the day, and again noticed a racket. The serviceman checked it
out again and wrote on the invoice he found pipes vibrating. He said he would
get insulation and return to wrap the drain hose, because the hose was vibrating
against the cupboard.

Before he returned, I used the dishwasher again during the day to listen for the
racket. The noise was gone. I immediately called and canceled the service
appointment with Bob's.

Then I got a repair bill from Bob's for $70.95. I was floored! This was a Maytag
recall. Maytag ordered the hose replacement and none of this would have happened
if not for the order.

D.F., South Bend

You run the dishwasher at night, no racket. Day, you get racket. Hmm. This
sounds like a sequel to "While You Were Sleeping." While you were sleeping,
D.F., your dishwasher apparently was having a party and didn't invite you. Bob's
said the racket was due to a problem with the pipes, which was not related to
the recall, so the company feels justified in the charge.

But Bob's doesn't care who pays the bill, as long as it gets paid. And
fortunately, Maytag decided to move the matter through the cycles. The company
sent a check for $70.95 to Bob's to cover the charge. You can sleep easy now.

Nice young man

 I had trouble with my dishwasher not cleaning. I called Ace Maytag in Mishawaka
and talked to a nice young man. He told me what he thought the problem was, but
my husband could not get the dishwasher apart to try to fix it.

We took a ride out to the store. The nice young man showed my husband how to
take the dishwasher apart and he ordered some parts for us. In three days, we
had a dishwasher that worked great. The young man's name was Steve.

Thank you, Steve and Ace Maytag. The next time we need a new appliance, we will
shop at Ace Maytag.

S.W., South Bend

We'll call this column, "A Tale of Two Dishwashers." Instead of Maytag and
Bob's, we have Maytag and Ace's and Steve. But the tales have one thing in
common: a happy ending.

Start the parade

 It's January in Michiana, which means for most people, kicking the
"fender-bergs" off their cars is the biggest entertainment going. So this
announcement actually might sound exciting: This upcoming week is the
fourth-annual Get Smart About Insurance Week. Can you stand the euphoria?

Before you start shredding your policies into confetti to celebrate, the Indiana
Department of Insurance suggests this is a good time to actually read your
homeowners and auto policies. A national poll found only about one-third of
policyholders could say they understood the details of their policies "very
well." The rest of us vaguely remembered writing grocery lists on the backs of
our policies.

The department is also warning consumers about fake insurance policies. The
policies are offered by fraudulent companies, usually at a very low price. But
they don't provide any coverage, which victims sometimes find out after tragedy
has struck.

Indiana consumers can contact the department before buying a policy to avoid an
insurance scam by calling toll-free (800) 622-4461 or online at
www.state.in.us/idoi. In Michigan, residents can call the Department of
Financial and Insurance Services at (877) 999-6442 or visit the Web site,
www.michigan.gov/cis. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners also
set up a hotline at (866) SMARTWEEK. Its Web site is www.naic.org.

SQUASH HALL OF FAME INDUCTS INAUGURAL CLASS AT LOCAL CLUB PHILADELPHIA WILL BE
HOME TO THE HALL AND A SQUASH MUSEUM. SEVERAL LOCAL PLAYERS WILL BE INDUCTED.

BYLINE: Bob Ford, INQUIRER STAFF WRITER

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. C05

LENGTH: 921 words


When Hunter Lott Jr. learned he would be among the inaugural group of inductees
into the United States Squash Hall of Fame, he took the news in easy stride.

"I told my wife that, at my age, they'll elect you to anything," said the
85-year-old Lott, whose modesty belies an excellence in squash and a devotion to
racquet sports of all kinds throughout his life.

Lott and 14 others were inducted into the new Hall of Fame last night in a
ceremony at the Racquet Club of Philadelphia, where the hall and the United
States Squash Museum will be located.

The hall and museum are the first to be sanctioned by the United States Squash
Racquets Association, the national governing body of the sport, which is based
in Bala Cynwyd.

Lott, an eight-time national doubles champion and the national singles champion
in 1949, was involved for decades in youth programs at the Merion Cricket Club
and also helped raised money to assist the sports teams at Penn. The tennis
courts in front of the Palestra were named in his honor.

"My mother taught me how to play tennis, and my father taught me how to play
squash, at Cynwyd Club when I was a boy," Lott said. "I wasn't anything special
at tennis, but squash was easy for me. I can't explain why."

It became more difficult for his opponents when Lott, always slightly weaker to
backhand, perfected a "double boast shot" that took him to the 1949 national
championship.

"I got licked in the singles final before I went into the service in 1941 and I
got licked again in the finals when I got out in 1946," Lott said. "I finally
developed that backhand boast shot and won the thing. You hit the ball on the
side wall and make it go up to the front wall, then hit the floor and side wall
and nick so it won't bounce. It just rolls out, and it's impossible to get. It
took a lot of practice."

Among the other inductees were Diehl Mateer Jr., with whom Lott won three
national doubles titles after World War II. Mateer, a graduate of Haverford
College, was as adept on the left wall as Lott was on the right. Mateer would
win a total of 11 doubles championships, with five different partners. He also
won three national singles championships and two intercollegiate titles, and was
the only amateur to win the U.S. Open twice.

Also inducted:

Stanley Pearson, a player and teacher at Germantown Cricket Club, was national
champion six times between 1915 and 1923. He lost one match during that time:
the 1920 national championship. (Play was suspended because of World War I in
1918 and 1919.)

Anne Page of Philadelphia, also a four-time all-American in field hockey, was a
four-time national singles champion beginning in 1936 and two-time national
doubles champion.

Germain Glidden, a three-time national titleholder (1936-38), was a lefthander
who also won two intercollegiate titles at Harvard.

Hashim Khan, born in India and later a resident of London, moved to the United
States in 1960 at the age of 44. He won three U.S. Open championships and two
U.S. Professional championships. In 1995, he was the national over-75 champion.

Charles Brinton, who learned the game at the Merion Cricket Club, was considered
the best U.S. player in the 1940s. He won four straight singles championships,
bookended around the three years (1943-45) during which the championships were
not held. He was also intercollegiate champion in 1941 and 1942, playing for
Princeton.

Elizabeth Howe Constable, who came from a famous squash family that played at
the New Haven (Conn.) Lawn Club, won the national championship five times
between 1950 and 1959. Her mother, Margaret Howe, was a three-time national
champion, and her sister, Peggy Howe, won twice. Constable later coached the
Princeton women's team for 21 years.

Henri Salaun, a four-time national champion and winner of the first U.S. Open in
1954, went on to win an unprecedented 26 hardball titles in various age-group
categories. He has won the over-70 division four times.

Margaret Varner, a native of Texas who began playing squash at age 31 after
winning the badminton world championship, won four straight national titles
(1960-63).

Victor Niederhoffer, a five-time national champion and three-time doubles
champion from Brooklyn, N.Y., was the only man to win four straight nationals
(1972-75).

Gretchen Spruance, from Wilmington Country Club, won five national championships
(1973-74, 1976-78), five national doubles championships, and two national mixed
doubles championships.

Barbara Maltby, a Penn graduate, lost in the finals five straight times before
winning the national championship in 1980 and 1981. She also won five national
doubles championships and one national mixed doubles championship, and was the
North American Open champion twice.

Mark Talbott, considered the most dominant player in U.S. history and now the
squash coach at Yale, won a total of 180 tournaments in his career. He was the
North American Open champion five times and the North American doubles champion
four times, and teamed with Gary Waite to win the doubles world championship in
1998.

Alicia McConnell, the world junior champion in 1980, was the best women's squash
player at any level during her years at Penn. In 1982, she was national junior
champion, national champion and intercollegiate champion, three titles she
collected during a single month. McConnell, who would win seven national

Dayton Racquet Club boasts talented chef

BYLINE: Alexis Larsen

SECTION: ; Pg. E4

LENGTH: 1064 words


Joe Fish is the executive chef at the Dayton Racquet Club.

Some major talent is fueling a handful of truly stellar dishes being served to
hungry patrons at restaurants across the Miami Valley.

There exists a group of chefs and sous chefs scattered across the region that
have the kind of impressive culinary chops and experience that can help elevate
dishes and meals to lofty new heights with flavors that sing.

In my opinion Chef Joe Fish - a 1988 graduate of Carroll High School - fits
squarely into this talent category.

Culinary background

Fish, who is currently the executive chef at the Dayton Racquet Club (DRC),
graduated with honors from the Culinary Institute of America with a focus on
French cuisine after completing his four-year degree in food science and
nutrition at Kent State University.

After graduation, he spent some time abroad including a stint as an intern at
the world famous Savoy Hotel in London.

Fish went on to cook in New York City for 12 years, including time spent under
Chef Alfred Portale at Manhattan's famed Gotham Bar and Grill. In 2007, Glen
Brailey - who currently owns Spinoza's Pizza & Salad in the Mall at Fairfield
Commons in Beavercreek - recruited Fish back to his hometown to help lead his
kitchen at Pacchia in the Oregon District (in the space Salar currently
occupies).

Side project: The chef case

Not one to rest on his laurels, in 2009 Fish and his wife - Tonia - opened their
own business, The Chef Case at the 2nd Street Market, while he was still working
full-time.

One of my favorite food vendors there, the booth offers many healthy vegetarian,
vegan and gluten-free friendly options either as a meal or as salads and sides
that can be purchased by the pint to go.

A Rock'n Tofu Ruben ($6.99) and the Chef Case Sampler ($6.99) featuring a choice
of five salads or four salads and a piece of tofu (add a whole herb grilled
chicken breast for $2) are go-to favorites of mine, not to mention fantastic
French macarons made by Jen Herrera and gelato from Dolcessa.

Dharma Rolls, a tribute to well-loved vendor who left the Market years ago, are
a brand new menu item being launched at the Chef Case this week. Dharma Rolls
will be, "interesting twists on the spring roll incorporating seasonal
vegetables and ancient grains for a healthy modern grab and go lunch," according
to Fish.

Racquet Club buffets

In the 18 months Fish has been at the Racquet Club, he has created one of my
favorite dining events in town - a lunch buffet concept that is put on every
Friday that takes diners on a culinary tour around the globe.

It succeeds not only in impressing DRC customers with colorful, flavorful
presentations, but also as a training exercise for his kitchen staff in culinary
techniques needed to execute new menu items.

Each Friday buffet features a full menu of soup, two salads, three entrees, two
sides and three desserts that offer a different complex range of flavors and
cooking techniques each week - one Friday it could be foods from Southern
California, the next foods of the Czech and Slovak Republic followed by foods of
the Netherlands and then foods of Texas.

Members of the Dayton Racquet Club pay $10 to eat. An incredible breakfast
buffet offered Monday through Friday at just $5 for members is also impressive
and definitely one of the best breakfast deals in town.

"We start with whole and natural foods. Soups and sauces are all made from
scratch. Most deserts are made in house. The kitchen staff really has a passion
for what they do," said Kevin Round, general manager.

Racquet Club membership

The bar and restaurant at the Racquet Club, which opened in 1971, are only open
to members and their guests, but there have been on occasion a rare evening,
such as a First Friday, where they have opened it up to the public, so it's
worth looking out for if you are interested in trying it out.

"We are always looking to grow the membership roster. A membership is much more
affordable than you might think. We have a variety of membership categories
including fitness memberships, evening-only memberships and special pricing for
younger members. There are never any food and beverage minimums," Round said.

As a sometimes regular at the Racquet Club, I have to say that often the food is
a perfect pairing for the dramatic, exciting views of downtown Dayton that can
be savored at the top floor of the Kettering Tower - especially with the holiday
lights this time of year.

The space has a great comfortable bar and lounge that seats 50-60 or a fine
dining room that seats 70-80. It also has a private library room that seats up
to 20, an intimate wine room that seats 8, a board room that seats up to 40 and
a large private room that seats up to

250. Each room and area has an modern, elegant vibe to it that is relaxing and
not stuffy. Service is friendly and prompt and private parties for members and
nonmembers can be booked.

Racquet Club menu highlights

A cider-braised pork shank served with new potatoes, haricot vert with Creole
mustard cream and roasted apples ($25) and a sweet chili glazed salmon served
with winter greens, toasted pepitas, sweet potato puree and miso broth ($23) are
dinner entrees that do not disappoint.

Best-selling menu items include fried Brie with orange marmalade and French
bread crostini ($11), goat cheese stuffed wontons with strawberry- jalapeño jam
($9), edamame hummus with naan flatbread, olive tapenade and meyer lemon olive
oil ($10), panko crusted dijon grouper with sweet potato mash and broccoli
florets ($23) and succulent grilled lamb chops with cannellini beans, diced
potatoes, wilted spinach and mint demi-glace ($32).

The full bar has a rotating wine and beer list of at least 50 different wines
and have an inspired collection of imported, domestic and local tap beers as
well as inventive cocktails like a Blackberry Mule and the Cucumber Collins.

Sure, the drinks are nice, but it's the food from Chef Fish and his team that
keeps me coming back for more. Did I mention that Friday buffet?

Makey and Owen-Browne prove to be a dream team at Queens;
Rackets

SECTION: SPORT; Pg. 75

LENGTH: 378 words


AFTER last year's disappointment of having to pull out of the final of the over
40 National Rackets Championships through injury, David Makey and Rupert
Owen-Browne erased that memory by winning the title at Queens this time around,
writes Jon Harvey.

The pair beat former Tonbridge School pupils, John and Adrian Spurling in
boiling conditions. Both teams decided on a best-of-three match, rather than
five, due to the temperatures.

Makey, Tonbridge School's rackets professional for 31 years, managed to get to
the final of the singles, but lost to former world champion James Male.

"We played the Spurling brothers in the final - it was a great match," Makey
said. "We won the first, they took the second and we won the decider - it was a
real punishing game in the heat. I taught Adrian in his last year at Tonbridge
School in 1988.

"I also lost in the singles final to James Male, although I played well. In the
end, he won - but it was a decent scrap."

British rackets is played in six clubs and 14 schools, mainly the major public
schools like Tonbridge, Cheltenham, and Winchester. Rackets, which began in the
18th century in the two big London debtors' prisons, the King's Bench and the
Fleet, is the ancient forerunner of squash and the world's fastest ball-game
with a small white ball which cracks round the high black-walled courts at
speeds of up to 160mph. Some players wear protective goggles.

Makey explained why he still loves playing the game.

Forceful "It is difficult to master, but once you do, it's very exciting and
fun," he said. "It's a very physical, strong sport and you have to be very
forceful. Hitting the ball at high speeds is dangerous, but people don't get hit
that much - it is one of those strange things. "To play the game is very
expensive - the courts cost a lot to build and the rackets need replacing so
much because of how powerfully you have to hit the ball."

The sport is set for a massive boost in Tonbridge as the town's school is in the
process of building a brand new rackets court - which will open in January 2012.

Makey is excited about the court being built and is about to embark on a tour of
North America with nine of the school's best rackets players, which will visit
Chicago, Detroit and Canada during the 10-day trip.

What a racket // Serena rebounds, lifts US to sweep

BYLINE: Andrew Cagen

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. B1

LENGTH: 609 words

DATELINE: WORCESTER


WORCESTER - By the end of the match, Serena Williams was able to joke about the
fate of her first racket of the day because she dominated the final two sets of
a 5-7, 6-1, 6-1 victory over Anastasiya Yakimova of Belarus, which clinched the
Fed Cup Group II tie for the United States at the DCU Center yesterday.

"The ground lifted up to my racket, I don't know how it happened," a smiling
Williams said after the match. "I don't recommend it."

The racket was destroyed after Yakimova, who had trailed four games to one in
the first set, won a marathon game and then swept the next game at love, leaving
Williams frustrated at her poor play. Yakimova went on to tie the set at 4-4,
drop a game and then take another three games in a row.

"It wasn't my best day," Williams said. "That's for sure."

In the second set, Williams resurrected her near flawless game, and she,
Christina McHale and the doubles team of Liezel Huber and Venus Williams
completed a 5-0 sweep over Belarus before a crowd of 2,279. McHale defeated
Darya Kustova, 6-0, 6-1, and Huber and Venus Williams beat a tired
Yakimova-Kustova team, 6-1, 6-2.

McHale and Serena Williams had won opening-round matches Saturday.

The victory allowed the United States to advance to a playoff in April against a
country to be determined, with the winner of that tie advancing to the Fed Cup I
competition next year and a chance to win cup. The four winners from the Fed Cup
II competition and the four losers in yesterday's Fed Cup I ties will play, with
the draw for the matchups to be held Feb. 14.

Asked to rank her demolition of the racket, Serena Williams said:

"That one is way low. I've demolished some rackets. Yeah, that was nothing. That
just goes to show you how frustrated I was today.

"I haven't done that in a match in a very long time."

She went on to describe what makes a quality smashing:

"Probably a lot of power, which I have, and a tremendous amount of anger. It
just gets better when you have more anger."

She did not blame her shaky first round on her ankle, which she sprained in a
tournament before last month's Australian Open.

"My ankle's good," she said. "You know, it's not healed, but it feels fine. It's
really kind of weird. I don't understand that. But it feels fine."

In the final two sets, Serena's overwhelming serve of between 100 and 120 mph
and her winning groundstrokes overwhelmed Yakimova.

Serena caught a break when Belarus captain Tatiana Poutchek decided that world
No. 1 Victoria Azarenka, who withdrew just before the start of yesterday's play
with a back injury, could not play yesterday.

"Yes, it was," Poutchek said of whether she had considered playing Azarenka.
"But, yeah, the injury is pretty serious, and we didn't want to risk putting her
on the court. There was no chance today."

The match opened with Serena Williams losing serve with three unforced errors,
and she made numerous unforced errors after that. But Yakimova had tremendous
difficulty with her serve, double-faulting four times in losing a game that made
it 3-1. She wound up with eight double-faults in the first set and 15 in the
match.

The vociferously pro-American crowd was treated to the dancing of In Da Zone of
the Boys and Girls Club of Worcester before the tie and the music between breaks
of the Holy Cross marching band.

weird world of sport

SECTION: SPORT; Pg. 35

Sheep counting

Any sport that puts you to sleep shouldn't be a sport at all.

Still, Australia's newest sport from 2006 is all about counting sheep.

Hundreds of maddened sheep are released into a field where 10 competitors must
count them all as accurately as they can.

The ``athlete'' who guesses closest to the number of sheep wins.

Two-handed tennis

Also known as two-racket tennis, the unusual way to play the popular game of
tennis was invented by physics Professor Don Mueller, also known as Prof Tennis
or Doctor Bones, who also teaches the ``Physics of Tennis''.

There is also the Two-Racket Tennis Federation in Moscow, Russia, which calls
the new sport Distennis.

The game is played just as the traditional tennis game, except that each player
has a racket in each hand.

For those who do not have a very good backhand, this way you play with two
forehands.

But you do not have to limit yourself to that, you can have two backhands as
well.

And if you get really frustrated, you can throw both rackets at the back fence.

Athletikophobia

There are many wacky sports out there in the world, but there are also wacky
phobias as to why people don't like sports.

Athletikophobia is the fear of watching or playing sports and is a lot more
common than you might think.

The recommended way to help a friend conquer this particular fear is not to
throw tennis balls at them - no matter how funny that may be - but to slowly
introduce them to their fear and help them work through it. Then throw tennis
balls at them later.

It just goes to show that there are as many wacky fears as there are sports.

Cardboard Tube Fighting

The Cardboard Tube Fighting League (CTFL) organisers in Seattle, USA, claim it
was created out of a desperate need to better train and arm citizens with
cardboard tubes.

The first rule of CTFL is don't break your tube.

A CTFL battle involves up to 48 combatants with the winner is the last person
left holding an intact tube.

Battles are regularly held in the USA but have been fought as far away as
Brisbane.

BOOKS; Trouble in Little Hoosick; MEMORIES OF SNOW by Alison Dye, Hodder pounds
9.99

BYLINE: EMILY GREEN

SECTION: SUNDAY REVIEW; Page  35

LENGTH: 473 words


ON 15 December 1944 in a snowbound trench in the Ardennes, a shell- shocked
soldier cradles a sick comrade. The soldier is one Raymond Smith, a farm boy
from upstate New York. The boy he struggles valiantly to save is his brother,
his mother's favourite son.

Action switches quickly to a farm in upstate New York, where the once heroic
Raymond is now a drunken farm worker. It is 1949. He lies hung- over in a cot in
a litter-strewn bungalow. The mother of his four-year- old daughter lies in a
casket in the main house, where her funeral will take place later that day. He
suffers alone because he and his dead love, Barbara Jean Racket, never quite
married. Raymond Smith may have started drinking to quiet the shell-shock, but
life on the farm with his putative in-laws was another sort of trench warfare.

The Racket family is aptly named. They scream at one another constantly.  There
is Grandfather Racket, a querulous old farmer who is now grief-stricken at the
loss of his daughter. There is Howard Racket, a fat and jealous son who has left
the farm to go into his wife's undertaking firm. This wife, Shirley Racket, is
menace itself, and it is her brutal desire that provides the motor for the book.
Barren, she now plans to snatch Raymond and Barbara Jean's daughter, Lucy, on
the pretext that she can offer the little girl a more wholesome environment.
This is her funeral home, where she plans to tutor the child in "mortuary
sciences".

The Rackets' incessant quarrels have a comic simplicity (Q: "What did you put in
this soup?" A: "Don't ask me, ask Campbell's!"). Elsewhere, though, the dialogue
falters badly; Alison Dye has a poor ear for nuance.  Rather, she piles on
folksy phrases: people saying "dang this" and "dang that" in places with names
such as Little Hoosick. It is no better when she writes conversations between
lovers, or when she is putting words in the mouths of French resistance workers.

There is a deeper false note struck by this book. For the era 1944 to 1949, the
writer is too much the good modern liberal. Raymond has post- traumatic shock
disorder. Barbara Jean was less a post-war farm girl, more a prototype single
mother for the 1990s: she worked, read books voraciously and demanded
independence. She rejected communist witch hunts so early as to qualify as
prescient. Naturally, after she died, the world fell apart without her.

Insofar as the book is convincing, it is through carefully accumulated detail.
Dye's descriptions of the plowshare, folk history of upstate New York and a WWII
soldier's kit are impressive. Yet her voice begins to drone as she calmly drives
her characters to rack and ruin. Though she appears to have enjoyed some of the
folklore, it would seem, on the whole, that Alison Dye did not approve. The
story ends on a note of nihilism.

Sundance looks for Racquet Club replacement: Festival organizers 'very
concerned' about losing big theater during renovation

BYLINE: Jay Hamburger, Park Record, Park City, Utah

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 762 words


May 1--Sundance Film Festival organizers have acknowledged they are seeking
another place to show films during the 2011 edition of the festival as a
replacement for the Racquet Club should the Park Meadows facility be under
construction in January.

In an interview, though, a high-ranking Sundance official declined to detail the
locations that the organizers have researched as potential new screening rooms.
Sarah Pearce, who directs the festival's operations and is a key figure in
theater decisions, said enough study has been conducted that a decision can be
made later in the year.

Pearce, though, said there would be fewer of the prized film tickets in
circulation under any of the alternate scenarios. The screening room in the
Racquet Club gymnasium is the second-largest of Sundance's Park City theaters.
It holds 602 seats, trailing only the capacity of the Eccles Center of the local
theaters.

"It's a problem because we'll lose slots for programming and tickets for locals
and visitors alike," Pearce said in an interview, adding that, "for one year,
we'll be OK."

Pearce and other Sundance officials addressed Mayor Dana Williams and the Park
City Council recently as part of an annual review of the operations of the
January festival. The Racquet Club was briefly addressed, with Jon Weidenhamer,
a City Hall staffer involved in Sundance issues, saying the renovation of the
Park Meadows facility should interfere with one festival.

City Hall is preparing to start an ambitious

redo of the Racquet Club, with the work starting as early as midsummer. Mayor
Dana Williams and the Park City Council, who have already set aside money for
the $10.5 million project, will be asked to reaffirm the funding during this
spring's budget talks.

The gymnasium is the only section of the Racquet Club that will remain standing
under the renovation blueprints. The construction occurring all around the
gymnasium, though, will stop Sundance from using the space for a screening room.
Organizers expect to return to the venue after the work is finished, probably
for the 2012 festival.

The Racquet Club is a busy Sundance theater, showing five screenings each day.
It was added to the festival lineup in 2005 as the most significant new Sundance
theater since the Eccles Center debuted in the 1990s.

In a report submitted to City Hall, Sundance officials say they are "very
concerned about losing Racquet Club." The report said "there aren't any good
alternative venues to replace this 'in-town' 600-seat theatre."

Several highly controversial films have screened at the Racquet Club, notably
"Hounddog" for a rape scene involving underage actress Dakota Fanning in 2007
and 2010's "8: The Mormon Proposition" for its portrayal of the role of The
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the passage of a California
ballot measure against gay marriage. A screening of the documentary about the
California ballot measure prompted a demonstration outside the Racquet Club
against the Mormon Church involving a few dozen people.

The screening room at the Racquet Club, meanwhile, continues to draw scattered
complaints from a few people who live close to the facility.

Sundance officials had hoped to present an annual report about the economic
impact of the festival this year during the recent meeting, but the numbers had
not been calculated yet. The report will be submitted to City Hall later.

Another discussion between the elected officials and the Sundance side is
expected later in the year, once the festival organizers finalize their
operational plans for 2011. They normally make tweaks to the festival, but the
plans for 2011 could include more substantial alterations to address the loss of
the Racquet Club if the renovation is underway.

The 2011 festival is scheduled to run from Jan. 20 until Jan. 30.

Sundance is widely considered to be the top marketplace for independent films in
the U.S. and one of the most highly regarded festivals on the international
circuit. Some of the films that have shown at Sundance in recent years and later
became hits include "The Blair Witch Project," "Super Size Me," "An Inconvenient
Truth" and "Little Miss Sunshine."

Tampa Tennis general manager takes sport to grassroots level to try to get more
kids involved

BY JEFF BERLINICKE

Special correspondent

TAMPA -- Ron Halaka arrived at Tampa Tennis at Hillsborough Community College in
February as the general manager and immediately set about improving the club.
One of his first goals was to create a buzz for youth tennis.

"I came to HCC because I knew we had a great facility that could be first class,
and I wanted to promote youth tennis,'' Halaka said. "It started as a grassroots
effort, and now we are on our way.''

He started by creating a 10-under tennis program that uses 36-foot courts,
smaller rackets, and low-compression tennis balls that bounce lower and don't
travel quite as far. It's called QuickStart Tennis and HCC is the only tennis
club in Florida that offers it. Halaka said there are kids coming from all over
the state for the Saturday morning lessons that he conducts on the 18 courts
that are designed only for kids 10-under. The "festivals" run from 9-10:30 a.m.

On a recent Saturday, more than 30 kids showed up for lessons on the smaller
courts for a play day that followed with hot dogs and sodas, but Halaka said
that wasn't enough to satisfy him yet. He's looking for 125 kids every Saturday.

The scoring is easy for the kids to understand. They play best 2-of-3,
seven-point tiebreakers, so the matches don't go on for hours.

Halaka hasn't kept the QuickStart program restricted to HCC. He has portable
QuickStart courts that can be easily set up in schools and he has done several
clinics at local elementary schools. The courts at HCC are permanent but the
portable ones just require a net and temporary-taped lines that are easily
removed. He said he could set up inside of a school gym in minutes.

The smaller courts also make it easier for kids to improvise games in their
driveway or yard. Halaka said that kids can play baseball, football, basketball
and other sports almost anywhere, but tennis requires a dedicated facility. The
smaller, portable courts make it easier to set up in the driveway or and take up
about as much room as the typical driveway basketball court.

The rackets are smaller than regulation adult rackets, but Halaka said parents
don't need to check out every sporting goods store in town. He has more than 100
smaller rackets available.

"Kids can't use their parents' rackets because they are too heavy,'' Halaka
said. "If they hit the ball, the ball flies off the racket. With the smaller
rackets and the balls we use, it all works out perfectly. Their arms are still
developing and it is more important for them to develop their swing than to hit
the ball with a regular racket. It gets heavier as they grow up.''

Manny Lontok has two children in the program, Maia, 7, and Marcus, 5, who are
just learning the game.

"They love it,'' Lontok said. "They are blown away and don't want to leave. It's
great to see them having fun on a Saturday morning. If we can get a group of
parents involved in bringing more kids, that would be perfect.''

For kids 10-under, the United States Tennis Association offers free membership.
The USTA is also helping out the QuickStart program financially. The Florida
Section alone contributed more than $5,000 of tennis equipment and annually
directs more than 90 percent of its membership dues back into the Florida tennis
community.

"This is the best kept secret in tennis and in all of Florida,'' said Jeff
Davis, the 10-under coordinator for USTA Florida. "Everyone is blown away when
they come out, and we just need to attract more kids. We get kids from all over
the state, but we want more. We want to teach team tennis, not just individual
tennis. You can see how much fun they are having.''

Brigantine CER introduces residents to different racket sport - Pickleball

BYLINE: Caitlin Honan, The Press of Atlantic City, Pleasantville, N.J.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 591 words


Jan. 23--On a recent Tuesday night, members of Brigantine Community Education
and Recreation traded in their traditional badminton shuttlecocks and rackets
for a Wiffle ball and squared wooden paddles. The newly widespread game of
Pickleball, once limited to an older crowd in Florida, has caught on with all
ages as the CER's latest addition to its winter schedule.

"It was a backyard game," Lee Mendell, CER tennis instructor and racquet sport
director, said. "It caught on in Florida, because with the senior citizens, it's
a smaller court, less running, less strenuousness.

But, it's still a racket sport.

"It's a modified badminton, ping pong, squash, tennis. It's all the same
strokes."

At first glance, the game does not appear to differ much from a standard tennis
match. It's played on a court with a few conversions to adjust the size,
including its net, which is lowered to 34 inches, according to the USA
Pickleball Association website.

The game is fast-paced, but easier on the joints, Mendell said.

The plastic ball must bounce on each side of the court before players can hit
the ball in the air or on the "volley," and the game is typically played to 11,
Mendell explained. The "kitchen," the seven-foot rectangle taped out in the
front of the net, becomes a no-hit zone, unless the ball bounces in the area
first.

The easy-to-learn game was named after a Florida family's cocker spaniel, named
Pickles, who made a habit of chasing stray balls.

Kay Papendrew, Barbara Rote, and Libby and Bob Canavan, all of Brigantine, had
not heard of the sport until this month.

"It's the second week, and they're hooked," Mendell said of the doubles group.

Papendrew, 60, never played racket sports, but concluded that the ease of the
game made it enjoyable and suitable for anyone.

"It's a lot of fun," she said. "Every Tuesday, I'd like to come out."

Opposing teammate, Rote, 50, said she had no problem keeping up with the new
game and joined to meet her neighbors after just recently moving to Brigantine
full time from Shamong Township, Burlington Township.

"I've never heard of it until last week," she said. "We just moved to Brigantine
full time, and I figured it would be a good way to meet people."

The newly instituted program, however, has brought out more teenage players than
the intended older crowd. Mendell explained that, over the past few years, local
middle schools introduced the sport to its gym classes.

Justin Grossman, 15, now a student at Atlantic City High School, recalled
playing the game through eighth grade. Although he is not a tennis player, he
enjoys coming out to stay active with his friends.

"It's just something to do instead of sitting at home," he said.

Kerin Maguire, 17, of Holy Spirit High School is an avid tennis player and sees
many differences between her sport and Pickleball.

"It's very different," she said. "A tennis ball is lighter, so the ball goes
higher."

The Brigantine teenager recommended the game to anyone.

"It's fun, so its doesn't really feel like you're exercising."

The Pickleball season runs six weeks, ending in mid-February, with tournaments
beginning in March. The group meets from 8 to 9 p.m. Tuesday nights in the
Brigantine Community Center on 265 42nd St. The fee for the season is $15 and
those interested can call the Brigantine CER at 609-266-3323.

For all tennis players here's a good reason to get into the racket

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. F4

LENGTH: 563 words


   John McEnroe hopes eventually to win nothing more than a tennis racket at the
European Community Championship of Tennis in Antwerp, but since the full-size
racket will contain 13.2 pounds of gold and 1,500 diamonds totalling 150 carats
and worth nearly $1 million, it has some attraction. McEnroe is the defending
champion, but he has a way to go: The prize goes to the player who wins the
annual event three times in a five-year span. The first racket was won by Ivan
Lendl who captured the ECC in 1982, the ECC's inaugural year, and 1984 and 1985.
This year's winner will pocket $215,000, the loser $140,000. In yesterday's
opening matches, Tim Mayotte defeated fellow-American Kelly Jones 6-4, 6-4 and
will meet Sweden's Joakim Nystrom in the second round; Polish veteran Wojtek
Fibak posted the first upset of the tournament when he defeated 20-year-old Ulf
Stenlund of Sweden 7-6 (9-7), 3-6, 6-0 and will play Yannick Noah of France in
the next round; Anders Jarryd of Sweden defeated Wally Masur of Australia 6-2,
6-2 and will face Brad Gilbert; and Martin Jaite of Argentina downed Karel
Novacek of Czechoslovakia 7-5, 6-4 and will meet McEnroe.

Canadian advances

Andrei Olkhovski of the Soviet Union, one of four qualifiers, upset fifth seed
Todd Nelson 6-2, 7-5 in the first round of the $75,000 Bergen Open in Norway. In
other first-round matches, third-seeded Patrick Kuhnen of West Germany beat
Jerome Potier of France 6-2, 6-4 and Martin Laurendeau of Montreal downed Audun
Jensen of Norway, another wild card entry, 6-3, 7-5. The two top seeds, Milan
Schrejber of Czechoslovakia and Jan Gunnarsson of Sweden, along with American
Peter Fleming, who beat Gunnarsson in last year's final, play today.

Basketball Insult and injury

Phoenix Suns captain, forward Larry Nance will be sidelined for four weeks after
fracturing the ring finger on his right hand in Saturday night's exhibition game
in Las Vegas when he hit his hand on the rim while trying to dunk a rebound.
Adding insult to injury, he was also called for basket interference . .  Vinnie
Johnson ended his holdout with the Detroit Pistons, signing a multi-year
agreement, The 6-foot-2 guard will earn an average of $650,000 per season during
the life of the three-year agreement and will have an option on a fourth year,
according to press reports . . . The Chicago Bulls waived free agents Scott
Meents and Tom Sheehy, bringing the club roster to 18 players in advance of the
Nov. 7 season opener.

Hockey Liut sidelined

Hartford Whalers goaltender Mike Liut suffered back spasms yesterday during
practice and may be out of the lineup for the next NHL game, though the team
said his condition will be reviewed on a day-to-day basis. Goaltender Peter
Sidorkiewicz will practise with the Whalers for the next two days and will be in
the lineup tomorrow night if Liut is unable to play.

Triathlon New Zealander wins

New Zealander Richard Wells has won the Nice Triathlon in France, the first time
in its six years that an American did not win, completing the swimming, cycling
and walking events in five hours, 59 minutes, 53 seconds. American Scott Tinley
was second and France's Herve Niquet third. In the women's division, American
Kirsten Hanssen was the winner with a time of 6:54:27, followed by 1985 winner
Colleen Cannon of the United States.

SQUASH: BOYCOTT THREAT TO ENGLAND'S HOPES

BYLINE: RICHARD JAGO

SECTION: THE GUARDIAN SPORTS PAGE; Pg. 21

LENGTH: 209 words


ENGLAND will be without six of their eight leading men for next year's World
Championships in Pakistan unless a boycott of next month's National
Championships in Manchester is averted.

The boycott is threatened by seven men who are demanding a doubling of the
national championship prize money and a reversal of the decision to change the
title from British to English.

The Squash Rackets Association have now extended yesterday's entry date by three
days so the players can be made fully aware that selection for England is
dependent on participation at the nationals.

"We don't want to get into a blackmail situation - we just want to create time
for communication so that they are fully aware of the situation," said Julie
Goodacre, the SRA's events manager.

Of the seven - Peter Marshall, the defending champion, Simon Parke, Phil
Whitlock, Tony Hands, Jason Nicolle, Stephen Meads and Del Harris - only
Marshall could still play for England because he has qualified for the World
Super Series final in Zurich which clashes with the nationals.

The prize money at Manchester is 1,000 pounds. There is no sponsor and the event
is being underwritten by the SRA. In the last world championships, England won
the silver medal.

JERNIGAN GAINS FINAL

BYLINE: By EDWARD B. FISKE

SECTION: Section C; Page 5, Column 1; Sports Desk

LENGTH: 322 words


Top-seeded Kenton Jernigan of Harvard will be going after his fourth consecutive
title when he takes on second-seeded Hugh LaBossier of Yale today in the final
of the 80th United States Squash Racquets Association singles championship.

A victory by the 21-year-old Jernigan would tie the record for consecutive
victories in the sport's longest-running event. Victor Niederhoffer won the
title four consecutive years beginning in 1972.

In semifinal competition yesterday at the University Club, Jernigan dropped the
first game to Morris Clothier, a junior at Franklin and Marshall College, before
taking control and winning, 13-15, 15-5, 16-14, 18-16. In the other semifinal,
LaBossier, a Yale senior, followed a similar pattern before disposing of
fourth-seeded Jeff Stanley, a Princeton freshman, 13-15, 15-7, 15-9, 15-7.

Miss McConnell Gains Final

In the women's open competition, top-seeded Alicia McConnell of Brooklyn Heights
dropped the first two games of her semifinal match against Nina Porter of
Wilmington, Del., before going on to win by 12-15, 15-17, 16-13, 15-12, 15-7.
She will face Sue Cogswell of Manhattan in the final. Miss Cogswell defeated
Gail Ramsay of Brooklyn Heights, 15-8, 15-6, 15-11.

Six hundred of the country's top male and female squash-racquets players are
competing in 16 draws, including both open and age-group competitions. Most of
the finals will be played today beginning at 9 A.M. at the University Club.

Two championships were decided yesterday afternoon. In the men's teaching-pro
division, Greg Zaff of Newton Centre, Mass., beat Paul Deratney of Willowdale,
Ontario, 15-12, 15-9, 12-15, 15-7. In the five-man team competition, Mexico
soundly defeated Harvard I, consisting of varsity players not competing in the
open competition, 5-0. The Mexican team, made up of school and club players from
the Mexico City area, went through four rounds without dropping a single match.

Federer Unstrung

BYLINE: By PAUL BERGER

SECTION: Section G; Column 0; Style Desk; Pg. 6

LENGTH: 250 words


TENNIS fans may lust after Roger Federer's racket strung with Roger Federer's
string. But if they bought a racket customized to his specifications,  they
might regret the choice.

For one thing, such a racket would be hard to control.  ''You either have to
have a real Roger Federer fetish or really good skills,'' said Nate Ferguson of
Priority 1, based in Florida, who does customization work for Mr. Federer and
other top professionals like Novak Djokovic.  ''Of the 100 guys out there at the
top of the game, none of them play with Roger's racket.''

Ordering a racket strung the Federer way is a bit like ordering a Starbucks
coffee. Just  ask for ''a Wilson 16 gauge gut main string and a Luxilon Big
Banger ALU Power Rough cross string,'' and then hope you won't have to say it
again. The racket itself is a Wilson K Factor  Six One Tour with a
90-square-inch head. The precise weight of his customized racket is a secret.

Assuming you've overcome the hurdle of ordering the strings, you would also need
a bit of cash.

At the Madrid Masters tournament this week in Spain, Mr. Federer is playing with
12 rackets, swapping on or near every ball change and alternating string tension
depending on the bounce of the ball (and his mood), so a full arsenal of
customized Federer rackets would cost about $3,500, including the cost of the
rackets.

''The racket gives you very little as a player,'' Mr. Ferguson said. ''It's
Federer's God-given talent that creates the pace and spin.'' PAUL  BERGER

Tennis club prepares its court case: Young players given a chance to master the
basics of the game

DATELINE: BURLINGTON


When visitors enter the front door of Burlington Racquets Club, their eyes are
immediately attracted to three prominently-hung framed drawings on the lobby
wall.

Each almost laughable image by today's standards is from the early days of
tennis. One depicts women in dresses playing at Staten Island, N.Y., during the
first ladies' open tennis tournament in 1883.

Another is from the first national lawn tennis tournament three years earlier.

Elsewhere inside the Dillon Road facility are illustrations of ancient-looking
tennis racquet designs and ball construction.

All of that art work on display is in recognition of tennis past. It's
downstairs, on the artificial surface courts of Burlington Racquets, where the
sport's future is taking shape.

Assistant professional Sean Johnny is in charge of teaching the basics to a new
generation of players.

"Nine ... nine is the new record guys," Johnny said enthusiastically to a group
of young students who were lined up taking turns returning short taps, trying to
reach 10, across a scaled- down portable net from their instructor.

Johnny, a 30-year-old Burlington resident, provides racquets that have handles
three to four inches shorter than regulation so they won't seem as unwieldy for
the kids. From the outset, they learn proper grip, stroke technique, and
practise with the aid of associated fun games.

Johnny hopes to renew tennis interest among the pre-teen set with the various
programs he is introducing at both the club and at school gyms in Halton.

"Ten years ago when I was teaching in this area, (tennis) camps would be sold
out ahead of time," Johnny said. "But the game itself doesn't seem to be as
popular now. There are many more sports out there that are doing a better job of
marketing than we are."

A product of College of Charleston in South Carolina, Johnny played both the
European and American satellite circuits for a year. Currently, he is ranked No.
2 in Ontario in the men's open category.

"We're also connected with the Halton Board of Education. We're doing free
lessons. I go into the elementary schools to do their gym classes for a day.
After an introductory lesson on the basics of hitting a forehand and backhand, I
leave the program booklet along with the scaled-down nets and equipment (about
30 racquets) with the gym teacher for a week.

"If children get to play tennis in gym class, they are more apt to play the game
in their spare time. "

The program he operates at Burlington Racquets is called Court Rats and its
based upon an American system -- Play Tennis America -- which has been in
operation for about four years. A free lesson introducing the Court Rat model
will be available to anybody age 4-12 this Saturday and Sunday at 1.30 p.m.
Burlington Racquets. To register, call 681-0119.

Seles signs deal, wields new racket

BYLINE: Doug Smith

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 2C

LENGTH: 361 words


French Open champion Monica Seles returned to the women's tour Wednesday night
expecting to reap greater success swinging a different racket.

Seles, 16, of Yugoslavia, in her first competition since losing to Zina Garrison
in a Wimbledon quarterfinal, used a Yonex super midsize racket in defeating
Audra Keller 6-2, 6-2 in a second-round match at the Virginia Slims of Los
Angeles.

Seles, who had used a Prince racket since she was 10, switched Tuesday after
signing a three-year, multimillion-dollar contract with Yonex, a Japanese
company. Prince signed rookie pro Jennifer Capriati, 14, to a multiyear, $ 1
million deal earlier this year.

Seles' deal, coupled with Fila clothing and Perrier pacts and prize money,
should increase her 1990 earnings to more than $ 4 million.

''This has been a great year for me, and with Yonex, it will only get better,''
said Seles, No. 3 in the world and winner of six titles.

 SERVICE SALUTE: Wimbledon champion Martina Navratilova and Garrison are
finalists for the Billie Jean King Service Award, to be presented Saturday. The
recipient, selected by the media, is ''one who personifies by deed the spirit of
Billie Jean King.''

 LEAGUE LAUDS LLOYD: John Lloyd of the champion Los Angeles Strings is the

Far Away From Center of Tennis Universe, Holabird Serves Up Big Sales In
Equipment

Baltimore County Retailer Becomes Top-Ranked National Player With Strategic
Positioning and Personal Attention

BYLINE: By Bruce Miller; Daily Record Business Writer

SECTION: Pg. 7Atop

LENGTH: 785 words


aryland, with its rude winters, is not exactly among the nation's tennis
hotbeds. California and Florida, which provide players with a year-round season,
are clearly the undisputed co-capitals of the U.S. tennis world.
Nevertheless, California and Florida have been outmatched by Maryland when it
comes to tennis gear, as an improbably located retailer on Baltimore County's
east side has established itself as the top-ranked supplier of racquets and
other equipment.     How did Middle River-based Holabird Sports become No. 1 in
such relatively inhospitable environs? By looking beyond its local market and
serving people where they play.

In position

Located on Route 40 just outside of the Baltimore beltway, Holabird receives and
processes an astounding 4,000 equipment orders every week. Roughly nine out of
every 10 of the orders come from out of state, via either mail order or the
Internet.     It's not hard to figure out how players find Holabird. The store's
advertisements are ubiquitous in tennis circles and perhaps more prominent than
Andre Agassi's now-bald head. In Tennis magazine, for example, Holabird has a
two-page spread every issue listing hundreds of tennis products.     David
Hirshfeld, Holabird's owner, emphasizes that his company's success has
everything to do with such strategic positioning.     The store has grown mostly
through smart marketing, Hirshfeld said, explaining that instead of trying to
sell a little bit of everything, as many of the competitors do, Holabird
specializes in only a few areas.     "Our business has stayed healthy because we
specialize in only select areas," Hirshfeld said, "whereas, the majority of the
big competitors really try to do a little bit of every sport."    In addition to
tennis gear, Holabird also carries racquetball and squash equipment, as well as
running shoes.     "You really can't be a specialist when you're selling hiking
gear and fishing gear and bicycles," he added.     Hirshfeld declined to
disclose sales figures.

Greenspring's offspring

Holabird got its start as something of an offshoot to the Greenspring Racquet
Club pro shop. William Hirshfeld, David's father, has owned and operated the
Greenspring club for a quarter century.     In 1980, the elder Hirshfeld opened
Holabird Racquet Club in Dundalk. One year later, the mail-order business that
would lead to the present-day Holabird Sports was launched.     "In the
beginning we used to take the orders at the Holabird Racquet Club and fulfill
them at Greenspring," Hirshfeld said. "Then in 1985, Holabird Sports became its
own entity."    What distinguishes Holabird from its national competitors,
Hirshfeld maintains, is personalized service. While the business's Internet
presence is growing constantly and its site is consistently upgraded, Hirshfeld
questions whether e-commerce is really the wave of the future.     "I still
believe that a lot of people like to call and speak to a human and get a little
personal service," Hirshfeld said. "Service is still the key."    Holabird, for
example, does not have an automated answering service. It is this personal touch
that brings in business.     "People know that when they call us someone is
going to pick up the phone and help them right away," Hirshfeld said.
Already flourishing, Holabird may have even better times ahead of it. Tennis is
making a comeback after struggling for several years, Hirshfeld believes.
During the late 1980's and early 1990's, golf seemed to surpass racquet sports
in popularity, he said. But as people realize how expensive golf is and how
little exercise is involved, they are turning back to tennis, racquetball and
squash.     Clinton Kelly, president of the Baltimore Tennis Patrons, agrees.
   Tennis is surging again because of the public's renewed focus on physical
fitness and the increasing popularity of some professional players, from Agassi
to the Williams sisters, Kelly said.     Kelly's group, the Baltimore Tennis
Patrons, is a nonprofit group focused on providing affordable and accessible
tennis lessons in the central Maryland corridor.     The Hirshfelds, elder and
younger, Kelly added, have been instrumental in getting the nonprofit off the
ground with donations and accommodations. When Baltimore Tennis Patrons first
began its work in 1998, it taught about 200 people to play tennis. This year the
group expects about 2,000 students.     "The growth of people coming into the
sport has been phenomenal," Kelly said.     The influx of players is vital to
Holabird's future, Hirshfeld said. "The growth of the business will probably be
because of growth of the sport."

Far Away From Center of Tennis Universe, Holabird Serves Up Big Sales In
Equipment

Baltimore County Retailer Becomes Top-Ranked National Player With Strategic
Positioning and Personal Attention

BYLINE: By Bruce Miller; Daily Record Business Writer

SECTION: Pg. 7Atop

LENGTH: 785 words


aryland, with its rude winters, is not exactly among the nation's tennis
hotbeds. California and Florida, which provide players with a year-round season,
are clearly the undisputed co-capitals of the U.S. tennis world.
Nevertheless, California and Florida have been outmatched by Maryland when it
comes to tennis gear, as an improbably located retailer on Baltimore County's
east side has established itself as the top-ranked supplier of racquets and
other equipment.     How did Middle River-based Holabird Sports become No. 1 in
such relatively inhospitable environs? By looking beyond its local market and
serving people where they play.

In position

Located on Route 40 just outside of the Baltimore beltway, Holabird receives and
processes an astounding 4,000 equipment orders every week. Roughly nine out of
every 10 of the orders come from out of state, via either mail order or the
Internet.     It's not hard to figure out how players find Holabird. The store's
advertisements are ubiquitous in tennis circles and perhaps more prominent than
Andre Agassi's now-bald head. In Tennis magazine, for example, Holabird has a
two-page spread every issue listing hundreds of tennis products.     David
Hirshfeld, Holabird's owner, emphasizes that his company's success has
everything to do with such strategic positioning.     The store has grown mostly
through smart marketing, Hirshfeld said, explaining that instead of trying to
sell a little bit of everything, as many of the competitors do, Holabird
specializes in only a few areas.     "Our business has stayed healthy because we
specialize in only select areas," Hirshfeld said, "whereas, the majority of the
big competitors really try to do a little bit of every sport."    In addition to
tennis gear, Holabird also carries racquetball and squash equipment, as well as
running shoes.     "You really can't be a specialist when you're selling hiking
gear and fishing gear and bicycles," he added.     Hirshfeld declined to
disclose sales figures.

Greenspring's offspring

Holabird got its start as something of an offshoot to the Greenspring Racquet
Club pro shop. William Hirshfeld, David's father, has owned and operated the
Greenspring club for a quarter century.     In 1980, the elder Hirshfeld opened
Holabird Racquet Club in Dundalk. One year later, the mail-order business that
would lead to the present-day Holabird Sports was launched.     "In the
beginning we used to take the orders at the Holabird Racquet Club and fulfill
them at Greenspring," Hirshfeld said. "Then in 1985, Holabird Sports became its
own entity."    What distinguishes Holabird from its national competitors,
Hirshfeld maintains, is personalized service. While the business's Internet
presence is growing constantly and its site is consistently upgraded, Hirshfeld
questions whether e-commerce is really the wave of the future.     "I still

example, does not have an automated answering service. It is this personal touch
that brings in business.     "People know that when they call us someone is
going to pick up the phone and help them right away," Hirshfeld said.

for spring and summer tennis programs. In 2015, more than 50,000 young players
participated in the youth events held in March, each designed to showcase how
fun and easy it is for families to get into the sport of tennis.

Tennis is an easy and exciting way to get active - all while having fun as a

TENNIS; Suffer from scattershot volleys?; Toes will tell if stance is askew

BYLINE: Rod Carlyletennis

SECTION: EXTRA; SECTION J; PAGE 07

LENGTH: 245 words


The volley should be the easiest shot to hit in tennis. All we have to do is get
the racket face in front of the ball and let the ball bounce off it.

The obvious question is then: Why do we have so much trouble hitting it?

From my observations, the cause of most volley errors is our toes. Our toes?
Unfortunately most people turn their toes 90 degrees before the ball arrives.

If you stand facing a mirror and extend your arm forward you will see that your
racket face is flat. Now turn your toes left or right and watch your racket in
the mirror. You will find that the racket goes backward, is pointing sideways
and is behind you.

Thus, when the ball arrives it either sticks on your racket and falls to the
court behind you, or you are forced to swing, driving the ball into the back
fence.

The next obvious question is: How can I get to the wide balls without turning?

Watch the pros and you will see that they cut off the angle by closing the
distance between them and the net. They never turn their toes more than 45
degrees and they keep their racket far out front.

By doing these two simple steps you will drive a crisp ball back to your
opponents, giving them little time to react.

Keep your toes forward and your volleys will improve quickly.

tennis everyone? Get into the swing

BYLINE: MICHAEL HAUN - STAFF WRITER

All right, no more excuses. With fall weather finally creeping into Florida, the
Its too hot outside line just isnt going to cut it anymore. Its a perfect time
of year to head outdoors and get into the swing of things on the tennis court.
Whether youre new to the game, or youve let a protective layer of dust and
cobwebs cover your old racket, there is an impressive array of tennis facilities
in Volusia and Flagler counties to hold court.

Dont have anyone to play with, you say? Not to worry. There are several
organizations out there to help you find the right tennis partners, and help
keep you swinging all autumn even better, all year long. From DeLand to Daytona,
Palm Coast to New Smyrna Beach, it seems you cant throw a fuzzy yellow ball
without hitting a public court.

There are a lot of options out there, said Jody Manning with state headquarters
of the U. S. Tennis Association . Volusia and Flagler are home to a number of
courts. In fact, the USTA has set up shop at one of the newest and largest the
Daytona Tennis Center on LPGA Boulevard. If youre looking for a place to play,
Manning suggests picking up the phone before picking up your racket. The Fall In
Love With Tennis THE RIGHT RACKET If your old tennis racket is made of wood, or
if it hasnt seen any action since the Williams sisters were in diapers, chances
are its time for an upgrade. Right now many of the tennis elite, like Todd
Martin, are swinging away with rackets made of a hypercarbon material, said Dave
Brown, director of tennis at the Florida Tennis Center. The hypercarbon rackets
are strong, yet lightweight. Top-of-the-line models will set you back anywhere
from $140 to $180. Looking for something a little cheaper? Graphite rackets
light but strong are much cheaper. PLAY ON CLAY? That tennis court in your
apartment complex is most likely made of concrete. It makes for faster play, but
isnt easy on the knees and those other sensitive joints. For a change of pace,
check out a clay court.

Its a little softer, and a little slower, Brown said. And its easier on your
body. You dont wake up the next day with aches and pains.

The Florida Tennis Center offers clay court action, as do other tennis
facilities in the area. ACHES AND PAINS Exercise physiologist Richard Cotton
says take five and stretch before you hit the tennis court. Its a simple rule
that can ward off injuries. Aside from stretching, Cotton also recommends
setting up a strength-training regimen. It will improve your game, and keep you
from being unnecessarily sore the next day.

Strength training is very beneficial, both in preventing injuries and in
performance, he said.Where To Go If You Play The Florida Tennis Center wants
adults to get back into the game. The center on LPGA Boulevard is hosting a
program to help people get back into the sport on Nov. 22. For the younger set,
theres a Little Tennis Program at the Florida Tennis Center. The program, a
six-week course that takes place throughout the year, is designed for kids ages
4 to 7. For more information, call (386) 671-8903. And local tennis enthusiasts
recommend calling your city of county parks department to find out what programs
they might be offering.Wheelchair TourneyTop wheelchair-bound tennis players are
coming to Daytona Beach this weekend. The USTA center is playing host to the
2003 USTA Wheelchair Championships. The three-day event kicks off Friday with
matches throughout each day of play until Sunday. The tourney is open to the
public; for details, call (386) 671-8949.

Riverview's Sanchez happy with switch | Junior stopped playing soccer, now Rams'
No. 1 singles player

BYLINE: John Lembo

SECTION: C; FL Sports; Pg. 2

LENGTH: 515 words


FEATURED SPORT: BOYS TENNIS

SARASOTA - It wasn't long ago when Antoine Sanchez was more concerned with
kicking soccer balls into a net rather than swatting tennis balls over one.

He was sure he was going to be a soccer player.

"When you're 9," he said, "you have all those dreams of going pro."

Sanchez still has dreams and aspirations. He just plans on living them out on a
tennis court instead of a soccer pitch.

The 16-year-old is the No. 1 singles player for Riverview High and takes an
undefeated mark into today's Class 4A-District 8 tennis tournament at Sarasota
Bath and Racquet Fitness Club.

Not only is Bath and Racquet the Rams' home court, it's also home to the Celsius
Tennis Academy. That's where Sanchez had his baptism into tennis after he lost
his taste for soccer when he was around 9 years old.

"I picked it up," he said, "and started loving it right from there."

Sanchez's interest in tennis used to be strictly recreational, limited to the
occasional match with his father, Lucien, on a Sunday. Sanchez saved his
competitive juices for soccer.

But a bad experience with a coach coupled with his club moving their practices
from Sarasota to Tampa led Sanchez in another direction. His mother, Elizabeth,
is good friends with Cary Cohenour, the director of Celsius Tennis Academy.

"I was just playing it to do some exercise," Sanchez said. "Then my coach
realized I was pretty good."

The United States Tennis Association ranks Sanchez in the top 10 in his age
group for the state of Florida. A junior, he has already received scholarship
offers from Northwestern and the University of Denver - though he said he hopes
to stay in state - and he has had no trouble replacing Michael Moore as the
Rams' No. 1 singles player.

"He's very disciplined in his sports and life in general," said Holly Holton,
Riverview's boys tennis coach. "He's headed in the right direction for sure."

When he's not playing with the school team, Sanchez practices at Celsius five
days a week and spends his weekends competing in tournaments. It's a lot of
tennis, but Sanchez is well aware of the possibility of burnout and gives
himself an occasional week off to rest his body and his mind.

That's the reason he opted out of being home-schooled after one year.

"I was just playing too much tennis. I was getting sick of it," Sanchez said. "I
didn't want the same thing that happened with soccer."

A two-time All-Area first team pick, Sanchez helped the Rams reach the Class 4A
state tournament last year and won a district title at No. 1 doubles with Moore.
He hopes to repeat at doubles with his new partner, Finn Anderson, while he
takes a crack at winning his first singles title at No. 1.

The district champions at No. 1 singles and doubles clinch a berth in the state
individual tournament to be played April 11-13 at Sanlando Park, though Sanchez
could get there anyway if Riverview qualifies again as a team.

"I'm very excited," Sanchez said.

And he's very happy he chose tennis over soccer.

"If you're mentally prepared and you're playing your best tennis," Sanchez said,
"chances are, you're going to win."

In New York everybody was saying, ''Quiet!'' and ''Cool it.'' Which is a lie to
start with, but a forgivable lie, as I will explain.

Literally speaking, it wasn't everybody who was urging soft talk. In fact,
during five days on the site, I didn't meet a single human who said either
''Quiet!'' or ''Cool it.''

On the other hand, I kept reading this advice in newspapers and hearing it
during television performances, which is to say from the media, much as I hate
to say it because ''media'' is such an odious word.

The word I prefer to ''media,'' when referring to New York, is ''racket.''
Racket is part of New York's very soul. ''The rumble and the ballyhoo,'' as a
fine old song says, is indispensable to the unique music the town makes.
Nowadays the chief racket makers are no longer the subway, the rattling taxi and
the scream of an axle shattered in a pothole.

Nowadays, the basic racket of New York comes from the media. Media racket is
pervasive. Walk into your lonely room, press a button, and there it is: media
racket. Open a paper over breakfast, and there it is: media racket, like this
very column, in fact.

So, with media racket being everywhere, you naturally conclude that whatever the
media are saying is what everybody is saying, because if the media aren't
everybody, who is?

Not you, sir or madame. If you were everybody, the media bosses wouldn't
constantly take your favorite TV program off the air on grounds that nobody was
watching it, would they? Obviously, you are not everybody. Mediawise, you may
even be nobody, no matter how real you feel.

In short, there is frequently a gap between New York's famously exciting racket
and its unthrilling reality. The gap seems unusually wide this week.

Underlying the racket was a poetic image: the city as volcano of seething racial
passions likely to explode if the local Owen Glendowers summon their demons from
the vasty deep.

Glendower, you recall, was one of Shakespeare's bellicose windbags who boasted
that he could call spirits from the deep. New York is afflicted just now with
Glendowers working the race issue for political advantage by promising the city
an evil end.

Shakespeare's Percy, a sensible skeptic apparently unknown to the New York
media, disposed of Glendower by reminding the old windbag that while he, or
anyone, could easily call to rise from the deep, spirits were highly unlikely to
come.

The sassy freshness of Percy's retort is apparently beyond the New York media,
for the bombast of local Glendowers forecasting various dooms for the city is
treated as such powerful juju that media people are advising each other not to
mention it lest publicity feed the power of these windbags.

And so, ''Quiet!'' and ''Cool it'' are what everybody seems to be saying if you
make the perfectly forgivable mistake of thinking that the racket, the rumble
and the ballyhoo of New York made by the media expresses the reality of the
town.

''So,'' somebody who got good marks in school will automatically, without
thinking, ask before falling back to sleep, ''So, what is reality, O Socrates?''

Reality is a city of eight million people, most of whom seem to be doing just
about what you'd expect them to be doing if domiciled in a city of eight million
people, too many languages, too little money, too many temptations and too
little living space.

They are going to and from work, standing around on street corners, shmoozing,
breaking a few laws, making love maybe a little too freely, eating probably more
than is good for them, worrying about Yankees and Mets, grousing about the new
taxes, buying or selling umbrellas, dodging cars, polluting the air, walking the
dog, seeing a show, getting married, getting divorced, complaining about the
super, laying a bet, seeing a flick, talking to somebody's answering machine,
asking why the cops are never around when you really need them, listening to an
opera, pimping, cursing rush-hour traffic, paying for a $75 meal with a plastic
card, washing windshields to make a quarter, fighting with dry cleaners,
struggling to tell Macedonian-speaking cab drivers how to get to Soho, uttering
wonderful New York sounds like ''Enough already'' . . .

Enough already. The racket is about scattered incidents of ugly violence, which
the authorities may or may not be doing their best to deal with. The reality, to
use e. e. cummings's line about life, ''is much too busy being a little more
than everything to seem anything, catastrophic included.''

Squash: Players intensify attack

BYLINE: From RICHARD EATON in Doha, Qatar

SECTION: SPORT PAGE; Page 44

LENGTH: 315 words


DEL HARRIS reached the last 16 of the Qatar International here yesterday and
then attacked the Squash Rackets Association for the limited prize-money in the
English national championships.

The man who helped his country to a silver medal in last year's world
championships defeated another England international, Stephen Meads, 15-8,
15-14, 15-12, in the richest tournament outside the World Open. In his post-
match interview he claimed that all of the English top 20 were now prepared to
boycott next month's nationals.

''The prize-money five years ago was twice what it is now,'' said Harris, who is
reputed to have made a fortune from endorsements at the time when the event was
the British national championships. ''The SRA don't have a leg to stand on and I
think they will have to listen to us now.''

The latest fax from here demands that a professional player is given a place on
the executive committee of the SRA and that the present criteria for English
ranking and selection (dependent on participation in the nationals) be dropped.
The SRA has consistently refused to consider changing the conditions of the
tournament.

Should the leading lights carry out their threat, Jonah Barrington, the
six-times British Open champion and now the SRA director of excellence, may play
in Manchester as a gesture of support for the event. ''I am disappointed with
the players' actions,'' he said. ''They do not appreciate the negative effect
their actions may have on commercial sponsorship in the future.''

''This is just blackmail by the SRA,'' countered Phil Whitlock, the England
captain. ''They are trying to force us to play in a devalued event where the
prize-money is half what it was five years ago. We have tried to compromise, but
they have not listened at all. Unless they have a change of heart, the matter is
closed and we shall not be playing.''

SQUASH: REBELS DEFIANT TO THE END

BYLINE: RICHARD JAGO

SECTION: THE GUARDIAN SPORTS PAGE; Pg. 13

LENGTH: 278 words


AFTER weeks of player demands and official threats, the Squash Rackets
Association yesterday decided to proceed with the men's English National
Championship next week in Manchester. But it is to be boycotted by 17 leading
players, which means England could be without a proper team for the 1993 world
and European championships.

The SRA thus backed down on its threat to cancel the men's event if the rebels
rejected a pre-Christmas compromise proposal, but not upon its insistence that
selection for England depends upon participation in the nationals.

This condition - along with disagreement about prize-money levels - is one of
the main reasons for the boycott. The move is supported by every leading man
except the England captain Phil Whitlock, who is for compromise, and the ageing
former British national champion Bryan Beeson.

The men's event will therefore be run principally for the benefit of 51 lesser
lights. The SRA's chief executive Chris Gotla said simply that it "respected the
freedom [of top players] to make their own decisions" but he also appeared to be
opening the door to future compromise.

In addition to the SRA's offer to host a players' meeting in London on February
10 - a British squash professionals' association is planned - Gotla pointed out
that selection criteria are, like other SRA policies, part of a "review
process".

The current British champion Peter Marshall and the national No. 2 Chris Walker,
both exempted by qualifying for next week's Super Series final in Zurich, have
pledged solidarity with the rebels - so a joke team may represent England in
April's European championships in France.

Coppermine to buy Bare Hills fitness center

Coppermine, which operates sports facilities and youth programs in Baltimore, is
buying Bare Hills Racquet & Fitness Club off Falls Road. Terms of the deal,
expected to close today, were not disclosed. The club, located at 1420 Clarkview
Road, not far from the original Coppermine location, will be renamed Coppermine
Racquet & Fitness. With the new club, Coppermine will expand its offerings to
include racquet sports and adult fitness. Coppermine's three existing facilities
cater to youth, offering team and individual sports programs, such as
gymnastics, dance, soccer, baseball and flag football. "We have probably 5,000
adults with kids coming through every week - now we can market to them," said
Coppermine President Alex Jacobs. Bare Hill offers group fitness classes,
tennis, squash and other racquet sports. The center has about 1,400 fitness
members and 500 tennis members. Coppermine will add youth racquet sport programs
to the center, but plans to keep the club's adult fitness and class offerings,
and that the ownership transition should be seamless for members, Jacobs said.
In addition to the Coppermine Fieldhouse, nearby off Falls Road, and Coppermine
Cross Keys, the company operates Coppermine Du Burns Arena in Canton. Bare Hills
has between 30 and 40 full- and part-time employees, and will bring the
company's total head count to about 140 workers, Jacobs said.

Howard Bancorp reaches $1 billion in assets

Howard Bancorp Inc. surpassed $1 billion in assets at the end of the third
quarter, a milestone for the community bank. The Ellicott City-based parent of
Howard Bank earned $1.7 million, or 25 cents per share, in the July-to-September
period, up from an $816,000 loss the same quarter last year. The loss last year
reflected a one-time $3.3 million charge related to a data system conversion and
costs associated with its acquisition of Patapsco Bank. "The third quarter of
2016 clearly evidences the success and sustainability of our organic loan
origination engine, without the impact of newly acquired growth," said Mary Ann
Scully, the bank's chair and CEO, in a statement. "We are pleased to demonstrate
the ability to consistently expand not only our balance sheet but also improve
our return on assets, return on equity and efficiency measures." Howard Bank's
$1 billion in assets, as of September 30, represents a 10 percent increase in
assets from the same time last year. The bank has 15 offices stretching from
Ellicott City to Annapolis and Elkton.

Pattern Of Conduct KEFAUVER REPORTAGE, MAY 1951 CHAPTER 237

BYLINE: By JAY MAEDER

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 33

LENGTH: 800 words

RUDOLPH HALLEY, chief counsel to Sen. Estes Kefauver's fire-breathing national
crime committee, was known to feel that former New York City Mayor William
O'Dwyer was less an active participant in the town's racket rule than he was an
unprotesting bystander to it. There was "no proof," Halley said, that O'Dwyer
had ever engaged in a "deliberate conspiracy" to protect organized crime. The
committee's conclusions, accordingly, were revised and softened several times
before they were issued to the public on Tuesday the 1st of May 1951.

They were devastating all the same. The O'Dwyer administration now entered the
history books declared a swamp of corruption and venality presided over by a
chief executive who was, at the very least, inattentive. Precisely as had the
1945 Brooklyn grand jury presentment, the Kefauver report, for page after page,
scathed O'Dwyer's "laxity" and "glaring deficiencies," both as Brooklyn district
attorney and mayor.

His failure to follow up concrete evidence of organized crime has contributed to
the growth of organized crime, racketeering and gangsterism in New York City.
...

Neither he nor his appointees took any effective action against the top echelons
of the gambling, narcotics, waterfront, murder or bookmaking rackets. In fact,
his actions impeded promising investigations of such rackets. ...

A single pattern of conduct emerges from O'Dwyer's official activities in regard
to the gambling and waterfront rackets, murders and police corruption from his
days as district attorney through his terms as mayor. No matter what the
motivation of his choice, action or inaction, it often seemed to result
favorably for men suspected of being high up in the rackets. ...

The tendency to blame others for the ineffectiveness of official efforts to curb
the rackets and the ensuing corruption has also turned up very often at every
stage of O'Dwyer's career.

It is "apparent," the report said, "that racketeers are firmly entrenched along
New York City's waterfront, with the resulting extortions, shakedowns, kickbacks
from wages, payroll padding, gangster infiltration by unions and large-scale
gambling." Mobster Frank Costello, it continued, had been and remained "a strong
and evil influence on New York politics ... now friendly with many Democratic
district leaders. ... His sinister influence is still strong in the councils of
the Democratic Party organization."

Nodding to O'Dwyer's ceaseless blusterings that any assessment of his public
career was obliged to consider all the schools and hospitals he'd built, the
senators conceded that he had "undoubtedly accomplished many noteworthy
achievements."

IN MEXICO CITY, U.S. Ambassador O'Dwyer had no immediate comment. In Congress,
there were mounting calls for his resignation. At the White House, President
Harry S Truman announced that he had every confidence in the nation's Mexican
envoy and would not fire him. In Brooklyn, mob kingpins Joe Adonis and Albert
Anastasia assured District Attorney Miles McDonald they certainly didn't know a
thing about the unfortunate demise of their waterfront racketeer pal Philip
Mangano, whose bullet-riddled body had recently turned up in the Bergen Beach
marshes.

And in Foley Square, O'Dwyer's loyal old friend James Moran, caught in several
bald lies in his testimonies before the Kefauver committee, went on trial for
perjury in federal court.

MORAN'S DISSEMBLINGS before the senators were "part of a calculated scheme
deeply rooted in a monstrous alliance between crime and politics," bellowed
prosecutor Eugene Roth. Moran, O'Dwyer's useful Man Friday for many years and
now the first person tried in consequence of the Kefauver hearings, stonily
declined to offer any defense at all. He faced up to five years in prison, and,
on Friday the 11th, that's what he got.

The presiding federal judge had been brought in from distant Iowa for the
occasion. He made a point of not issuing ringing magisterial oratory when he
handed down the maximum punishment. "I expect the less I say about this, the
better," the out-of-towner acknowledged.

RUDOLPH HALLEY, 37 years old, was overnight, by reason of television, a national
figure. In New York City, he was as sensational a crime smasher as Judge Sam
Seabury and Special Prosecutor Tom Dewey had been in the 1930s. By the end of
May, the Liberal Party had firmly named him its candidate for City Council
president in the forthcoming fall elections and the old Fusionists were debating
his prospects as well. Here was very likely the next mayor. Democrats and
Republicans, meanwhile, contemplated with growing alarm the public clamor over a
corruption-busting grand inquisitor who showed every sign of turning into the
single most menacing political threat of their recent lifetimes.

NEW-LOOK WOODSMILL HAS COZY ATMOSPHERE, GOOD JUNIOR PROGRAM

BYLINE: Ron Cobb

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 5D

LENGTH: 1187 words


This is another in a series on indoor clubs in the St. Louis area.  If you love
tennis, you'll love Woodsmill Racquet Club. If tennis itself isn't enough,
there's always Creve Coeur Racquet Club to the northeast, Town & Country Racquet
Club to the southeast and Concord Sports Clubs farther south.  . . .  Since
Woodsmill opened in 1973, indoor tennis has been the attraction.  There's a bar
and a lounge area, but no pool, no outdoor courts, no fitness area and no
restaurant. Part of the reason is the club's location. It is tucked away in a
residential setting off Old Woodsmill Road, just north of Clayton Road in Town
and Country.  The club's vice president and manager, Bijan Zahiri, says that
plans to add amenities such as a pool and outdoor courts met resistance in the
early and mid-1980s from both neighbors and local government, even though the
club owns the land on which it would have expanded. Nearby residents worried
about the increased traffic and other activity that a bigger club would bring.
Zahiri says the club spent $30,000 in lawyers' fees and other expenses before
scrapping plans for expansion. Yet Zahiri now sounds as if he never was
convinced that Woodsmill would have been doing the right thing by growing.  His
family, which owns General Land and Racquet Sports Corp., bought the club in
1976 from original owner Jim Burst. Zahiri took over as manager in 1985 after
he'd earned an undergraduate degree at the University of Kansas and a doctorate
in business at San Diego State. ''We weren't sure if tennis was going to grow
more than it is today,'' he says. ''All of a sudden there were all these other
clubs.'' Indoor clubs within a radius of a few miles to the north, east and
south gave Zahiri pause. He wondered if enough new members could be found to
justify expanding the club.  Instead of building on, Woodsmill wound up
refurbishing what it already had.  Players who enter next week's Woodsmill
Holiday Open (entry deadline Monday; call 227-3385) will find a club that looks
brand-new. Extensive remodeling was completed in September.  The club prides
itself on a cozy, warm atmosphere.  ''People tell me they like the friendly
feeling they get when they walk in the door,'' says Nancy Pound, who has been a
teaching pro at Woodsmill for four years and the head pro since last April. The
staff also includes Dave Morris, Scott Ihrke, Nadir Djavaherian and Tim Noonan.
Pound is one of the area's most experienced pros. She has taught tennis in St.
Louis for 23 years and was a physical education teacher at a Ladue junior high
for 12 years. She also was a pro at Algonquin Golf Club and South Hampshire
Racquet Club until four years ago, when she took some time off to d decide
whether to continue teaching tennis or go back to teaching school.  It was then
that Jorge Ramirez, then the Woodsmill head pro, invited her to help run
Woodsmill's women's interclub practice, and she's been at the club ever since.
Woodsmill's interclub program is strong, with three women's teams that practice
1 1/2 hours each week in addition to their matches and two men's teams. Pound
also is proud of the way the junior program has rebounded from a slump. She says
it's snowballed so much that the staff has run out of room on its eight courts.
''We were all going to put on hard hats and build a Court 9 the other day,'' she
says.  Zahiri counts himself among the club's pupils. He played racquetball in
college, then took up tennis when he came to Woodsmill.  ''I still need
lessons,'' he says.  Pound, ever the teaching pro, adds with a smile, ''Nobody
outgrows the need to take lessons.'' Elsewhere: A dedication ceremony for the
Simpson Tennis Center at Gordon Moore Park in Alton has been set for May 5. The
Prince tennis firm is paying the tab to bring in former world champion Stan
Smith and Jack Groppel, the fitness expert for Tennis magazine and tennis
director at the Harry Hopman Tennis Academy in Tampa, Fla., for an exhibition
and clinic.  The tennis center will have eight outdoor courts, a pro shop and a
viewing platform.  Pete Sampras has committed to enter the Volvo Tennis/Indoor
in Memphis, Tenn., Feb. 18-24. Officials expect a strong field because the
tournament has been upgraded to one of eight Championship Series events on the
IBM/ATP Tour and will offer $750,000 in prize money, an increase of $500,000
over this year.  Memphis is a 4 1/2-hour drive down I-55. For ticket

TENNIS USTA Girls 14s begins this week at South Fulton

BYLINE: By Todd Holcomb STAFF WRITER

SECTION: EXTRA; Section K; Page 6

LENGTH: 300 words


One of the state's largest tournaments, the Reebok Georgia State Junior Open,
finished last week at South Fulton Tennis Center after a two- week run that drew
more than 650 players.

Now, South Fulton is getting ready for the annual USTA Girls 14 National
Championships.

"It's small," tournament director Robert Sasseville said of the national
championship for girls 14-and-under players. "It's only a 128 [player] draw.
This past week we had 340, and the week before it was 320."

Last week's portion of the Georgia Open tournament, the boys and girls 16s and
18s, drew players from California, Utah, Germany and Puerto Rico, but local
players had some success. Amy Robertson of Newnan reached the final in the girls
16s but lost to top-seeded Judith Hagedorn of Germany 6-3, 7-6. Chrissy Pietro
of Peachtree City and Heather Umbach of Newnan reached the girls 16 doubles
final, losing to top-seeded Mary Manon of Park City, Utah, and Janie Wicklund of
Dunwoody.

Girls 14 Nationals: The Girls 14 Nationals begin Saturday. Jennifer Capriati and
Mary Joe Fernandez are among those who have played and failed to win the South
Fulton tournament. Capriati played it as an 11- year-old, Fernandez at 12.
Chanda Rubin is a former champion. The top local player in the field will be
Ramsey Roberts of Peachtree City.

Tournament news: Charles Marquardt of Peachtree City was the men's 50-and-over
singles champ at last week's Crackerland Championships in Athens. He defeated
Bob Taylor of Watkinsville 6-3, 6-7, 7-5 in the final. The previous weekend,
Marquardt played for a senior team that won the USTA League Southern Section
Championships in Mobile, Ala. The team, based out of North Fulton Tennis Center,
will play for a national team championship at the 4.5 level in November in
Phoenix.

GRAPHIC: Photo: Chris Hagman Cannongate Clubs The key to hitting the volley is
starting in the correct ready position. Hold the racket firmly, and use the
continental grip. For right-handers this grip shows the index knuckle on the top
right bevel. Move your elbows slightly in front of your body and have the racket
head up so your eyes look over the top of the racket. When the ball comes,
simply turn your strings and block the ball. For racket movement on the volley,
less is more.

One of the state's largest tournaments, the Reebok Georgia State Junior Open,
finished last week at South Fulton Tennis Center after a two- week run that drew
more than 650 players.

Now, South Fulton is getting ready for the annual USTA Girls 14 National
Championships.

"It's small," tournament director Robert Sasseville said of the national
championship for girls 14-and-under players. "It's only a 128 [player] draw.
This past week we had 340, and the week before it was 320."

Last week's portion of the Georgia Open tournament, the boys and girls 16s and
18s, drew players from California, Utah, Germany and Puerto Rico, but local
players had some success. Amy Robertson of Newnan reached the final in the girls
16s but lost to top-seeded Judith Hagedorn of Germany 6-3, 7-6. Chrissy Pietro
of Peachtree City and Heather Umbach of Newnan reached the girls 16 doubles
final, losing to top-seeded Mary Manon of Park City, Utah, and Janie Wicklund of
Dunwoody.

Girls 14 Nationals: The Girls 14 Nationals begin Saturday. Jennifer Capriati and
Mary Joe Fernandez are among those who have played and failed to win the South
Fulton tournament. Capriati played it as an 11- year-old, Fernandez at 12.
Chanda Rubin is a former champion. The top local player in the field will be
Ramsey Roberts of Peachtree City.

Tournament news: Charles Marquardt of Peachtree City was the men's 50-and-over
singles champ at last week's Crackerland Championships in Athens. He defeated
Bob Taylor of Watkinsville 6-3, 6-7, 7-5 in the final. The previous weekend,
Marquardt played for a senior team that won the USTA League Southern Section
Championships in Mobile, Ala. The team, based out of North Fulton Tennis Center,
will play for a national team championship at the 4.5 level in November in
Phoenix.

GRAPHIC: Photo: Chris Hagman Cannongate Clubs The key to hitting the volley is
starting in the correct ready position. Hold the racket firmly, and use the
continental grip. For right-handers this grip shows the index knuckle on the top
right bevel. Move your elbows slightly in front of your body and have the racket
head up so your eyes look over the top of the racket. When the ball comes,
simply turn your strings and block the ball. For racket movement on the volley,
less is more.

Twin handles are double trouble; Funky rackets helping brothers

Laugh them off at your peril.

Playing with their funny-looking, two-handled rackets that have been compared to
hedge clippers, a tuning fork, a divining rod and jumper cables, the Battistone
brothers have climbed from nowhere to the top 350 doubles players in the world.

They won their first match of the Odlum Brown Vancouver Open and were set to
play again Thursday at Hollyburn.

Dann, 31, and Brian, 28, think if they win a Challenger event they've got a
serious shot at a U.S. Open wildcard; their freaky appeal tipping the scales.

They may be a sideshow -- a warm-up session Monday turned into an impromptu
clinic for 30 fascinated kids -- but they are one that demands to be taken
seriously.

"There's just no comparison," Dann says of hitting with two hands, gripping the
racket like a giant wishbone. "Think about moving a car. Would you push from the
middle, or would you push from the back and pull from the front?"

And with one hand, they say, there are more shots available because the handles
jut out at 35 degrees. There's also a deception element with being able to flip
the racket and dramatically alter angles quickly.

"Our first match, there were maybe 10 points we won because of the racket."

Both are former pros from, where else, Las Vegas. They quit the tour in 2000,
going on separate Mormon missions to Rio de Janeiro -- they speak Portuguese on
court -- but before Brian left he hooked up with the racket's Canadian-born
inventor, Lionel Burt.

Seeing health benefits in arm alignment and balancing out the body, he gained
International Tennis Federation approval.

Brian, known for his 130-mph volleyball-like jump serve (check out YouTube),
worked on the prototype before a family connection with Easton Sports sped up
the process.

"I learned to do a lot with a blowtorch, screws and welding glue," he says.

The brothers returned to the tour -- new rackets in hand -- in October 2007,
going in 50/50 with Burt on the business side. They soon won a Futures event in
Baton Rouge, La.

"The highest ranking I had in doubles was, like, 800 in 2000," says Dann.

"Then, all of a sudden, I take seven years off and now we're closing in on the
200s. That shouldn't really happen."

Learning tennis with bad bounces, champion, 86, now acing good ones

BYLINE: NOLAN HAYES nhayes@heraldsun.com; 419-6670

SECTION: FRONT; Pg. A1

LENGTH: 2206  words


Back in the 1920s, Wade MacDonald would take his tennis racket and slam balls
off a wall of Scotts School in Iredell County.

There was no real tennis court. MacDonald, nearing the end of his first decade
on Earth, just ran around on some dirt, hitting the ball with a racket his
mother won as a tournament champion at Farmville (Va.) State Teacher's College.

Nearly 80 years later, MacDonald still is running around on the dirt. But times
have changed.

The racket in his hands has evolved from heavy steel to lightweight titanium.
And the dirt on the bottom of his shoes no longer is coarse and hard. It's green
clay, smooth and fine.

"When I first started, it was dirt, sand and rocks and all that stuff," said
MacDonald, a retired teacher and coach who has lived in Durham for the majority
of his 86 years. "So if the ball kind of takes a bad hop, I'm pretty good at
adjusting quickly, because when I was banging against that school building,
there were pebbles all around. I kind of grew up on that bad-bounce stuff."

That makes the good bounces even more enjoyable. And MacDonald got plenty of
those earlier this month, when he teamed with Jim Chavasse of Raleigh to win a
national championship in doubles.

The duo won the USTA National Men's 85 Clay Court Championships in Pinehurst,
with each player earning the first USTA gold ball of his career.

"We were elated," MacDonald said.

MacDonald and Chavasse, playing partners off and on during the last 20 years,
got together for the national tournament because Chavasse -- in his words --
"finally caught up with old folks."

Chavasse, 84, is two years younger than MacDonald, so the pair had to find new
partners once MacDonald aged into the 85-and-over category. Players can play in
the 85s if they are going to turn 85 at any time during that year, so Chavasse's
Dec. 29 birthday allowed him to rejoin MacDonald for the Pinehurst tournament.

"At the beginning of the tournament, Wade and I both agreed that we wouldn't
give 5 cents for our chance of winning it," said Chavasse, who grew up in
Henderson and later attended UNC. "But we lucked up and got through it. We
played pretty well to get that."

MacDonald and Chavasse cruised into the semifinals before playing the top-seeded
duo of Irving Converse of Fort Myers, Fla., and William Kuntz of Mandeville, La.
The Triangle tandem dropped the first set before rallying to win the match 3-6,
7-5, 6-4.

MacDonald and Chavasse repeated the feat in the final, beating Barrett Scallet
of St. Louis and Norman Stoll of Grand Rapids, Mich., 5-7, 6-4, 6-2. The
championship comeback came in part because of improved play from MacDonald, who
gained better control of his topspin lob by switching rackets after the first
set.

Winning, inclusive coach

Such adjustments come naturally to MacDonald, who coached at Carr Junior High
before moving on to Rogers-Herr Middle School when it opened in the late 1960s.

He coached football, basketball, track and baseball at different times during
his career, winning several city championships. He once guided Carr to 45
consecutive victories in basketball.

Even more important, his belief in inclusion helped ease racial integration for
athletes on his sports teams. To this day, MacDonald's former students and
athletes -- black and white alike -- recognize him and share warm greetings when
he's out and about.

"Lots of people know him in town and still ask about him -- they always ask how
my dad's doing," said Stephen MacDonald, 40, the youngest of Wade MacDonald's
three children.

Yes, people still enjoy MacDonald. But most of the enjoyment today comes at
Hollow Rock Racquet and Swim Club. MacDonald joined the club years ago so he and
Stephen, who starred at Jordan and later played at N.C. State, wouldn't have to
wait for court time during the tennis boom of the 1970s.

MacDonald plays there three or four times a week to keep his strokes sharp.

"He'll play with anybody -- it doesn't matter what level they are," said Jim
McDonald, Hollow Rock's director of tennis. "If he can swing a racket and hit a
ball, he's happy to play with you -- good, bad, young, old -- it doesn't matter.
He's always willing to help people and get them in the game. He's a real
treasure."

Hard work, preparation

MacDonald gives back to tennis that way, but he also can give something else:
beatings to players half his age.

Old McDonald had a farm. But Old MacDonald has a forehand -- and he's not afraid
to use it.

"It's all fun, but you want to win," MacDonald said.

MacDonald has won several state tennis titles in his age group, but he still
works hard. To prepare for his latest triumph at the nationals, he rode a
stationary bike in his house and did plenty of work in his yard. He also reaches
into the breadth of knowledge he developed as a teacher of health and physical
education, and that leads him to cut down on his bread consumption while adding
to his water intake.

And for anyone who's wondering: Yes, he eats his Wheaties.

"It shows that he exercises and tries to stay in shape the best he can," Stephen
MacDonald said. "It's paid off."

Tough times growing up

But Wade MacDonald declines to take credit for his longevity. He praises his
"good fortune" every chance he gets and points to his "good genes." His mother,
who nearly died when giving birth to him on Oct. 5, 1917, in Rustburg, Va.,
lived to be 92. His father's mother came up four months short of reaching 100,
and one of his uncles lived to be 102.

Still, MacDonald has survived some trying times. He lived through the Great
Depression as a youngster, picking cotton for half a cent a pound until he saved
$100 and put in the bank. The bank went bust, and his hours of sweat and blood
resulted in $10.

"That was a real downer," he said, with no hint of sarcasm.

The economy also played a role in the next few years of MacDonald's life. He was
ready to end his standout career in baseball and basketball at Scotts School
after 12th grade. But his sister was in college at the same time in Virginia.
The family couldn't afford two sets of tuition, so MacDonald waited a year for
her to finish.

"I could have graduated but didn't accept the diploma," he said. "In those days,
if you didn't get a diploma, you didn't graduate, and then you could play
another year."

So "Boots" -- he always hunted and worked in the woods while wearing bright red
boots -- stayed his extra year. He headed to Erskine College in South Carolina,
the same school his principal and coach attended. He played baseball and
basketball on a scholarship that paid for half of his tuition.

MacDonald, a first baseman and third baseman, wasn't allowed to play tennis
because it conflicted with baseball. But he sneaked in a match or two when he
could.

MacDonald hung around South Carolina after his standout career -- he was
inducted into Erskine's athletics Hall of Fame in 1987 -- and taught school for
three years. After that, he returned to his family's home in Virginia to work at
Christchurch School, a tiny private school of about 60 students at the time.

Heading off to war

He was there for almost a year when one Sunday he was sitting at his desk
listening to the radio. An urgent bulletin came over the airwaves.

"It said, 'Special! Pearl Harbor,' " MacDonald recalls. "And so as time moved
on, I felt I should get in the service and do something."

The headmaster at Christchurch School -- which, coincidentally, Chavasse
attended just a couple of years earlier -- gave MacDonald permission to leave,
and he joined the Navy.

He served four years (1942-46) and worked in communications because he stated on
his application that he could type. MacDonald was part of the Utah Beach landing
in World War II and nearly was in major danger on D-Day. But a boom broke on his
ship, delaying his arrival until the day after the Allies began their invasion
of Europe.

"I missed it by one day," MacDonald said. "I was lucky, I guess, that that
happened."

MacDonald talks of the war and its casualties with sadness in his voice,
downplaying his role in the operation because he got to live a life many of his
fellow servicemen lost in 1944. But he also had some fun during his stint in the
Navy.

Baseball with a legend

After the war, MacDonald was shipped to Pensacola, Fla., where he played
baseball on a naval base with Boston Red Sox outfielder Ted Williams. Williams'
Hall of Fame career was being interrupted by his military duty, and MacDonald
says Williams wasn't much interested in naval baseball.

"Ted would stand around and talk," MacDonald said. "He always talked fishing --
that was his thing. To heck with the baseball. He would talk fishing. And he
wouldn't try. If he hit a ball that he might get a single and have to run hard
to first base, he just wouldn't try."

But the competitor in Williams came out on one occasion when some of the other
players began razzing him.

" ... I guess he got kind of [angry] with that, so the next time he came up, he
hit a ball waaaaayy out in center field," MacDonald said. "The guy had already
moved back because he knew he could hit good, and he did. He ran back just in
front of the hangar and caught it.

"It was a looooong-hit ball. There was no fence. It was just on the base, and
the airport hangar was way out there. There was plenty of room. Nobody else hit
anything anywhere near that."

MacDonald left the Navy shortly after his stay in Pensacola, and he headed to
Durham to work in a department store owned by one of his uncles. He worked there
for three years before getting back into teaching and coaching with the help of
former Durham High football coach Carey Brubaker.

Meeting wife in class

MacDonald went back to school to continue his education, attending UNC for four
summers while teaching during the fall and winter. He had to renew his teaching
certificate one more time to make it permanent, and at the suggestion of one of
his professors at UNC, he traveled to Boulder, Colo., for a change of scenery
instead of completing the work locally.

His first day of classes started poorly, and he changed one of his courses
because he thought the professor would be too demanding. MacDonald got in line
to change to another class, and he got into the one he wanted only because a guy
two spots ahead of him in line was dropping it.

MacDonald walked into his new class not expecting much.

"There were like five rows of seats, and there was a seat on the corner,"
MacDonald said. "Then there was another seat, and at the end of the third row --
I had just gotten there, and I kind of looked around, and I looked over there
and thought, 'I like that gal right there.'

"In five weeks, we were engaged. That Christmas, we were married."

MacDonald and "that gal," Barbara, enjoyed 49-plus years together. Their three
sons -- Wade Jr., Roy and Stephen -- all graduated from N.C. State and have
produced six grandchildren. The oldest, Anna, renamed her grandparents. Barbara
became Mimi, and Wade became PaPa.

Void after MiMi's death

MiMi and PaPa grew old together in the house, which was built right after they
got married. MiMi served as general contractor during the project and got the
house built to her specifications. And PaPa made sure he got the carport he
always wanted.

The couple traveled the world together, exploring the United States, Canada and
overseas. But upon return from one of their trips, a cruise, MiMi became ill.

She died soon after -- at Duke Hospital on Aug. 26, 2003. Wade MacDonald has the
date written on a slip of paper he keeps in a cabinet at their home. He has
changed little about the house since MiMi died, keeping everything just as she
left it.

"That was for Thanksgiving or something," he says, pointing to one set of
decorations. "But I just leave it there. I don't want to change it."

MacDonald also still has the scores of sympathy cards he received after MiMi's
death. They are sitting on a table because he can't bear to throw them out.

MacDonald's sorrow kept him from playing in the USTA national clay court
tournament last year. He tried to keep himself busy by gardening, making wooden
stools and doing word jumbles, activities that he still does on a regular basis.

'I've had a good life'

But something was missing.

"I just didn't have the heart to play, so I missed last year," MacDonald said.
"But this year I knew I had to get back to doing it. That helps along the way."

MacDonald's family has helped, too. Stephen MacDonald assists his father with
heavy yardwork or repair work when necessary and often brings over his daughter,
Leland, to visit her grandfather.

But PaPa still can make it on his own.

"I think the fact that he has outside activities has really helped," Stephen
said. "I've been most proud of Dad for stepping up and learning chores that he
probably hasn't done for decades. When Mom was there, that was stuff he never
did. It just goes to show you can teach an old dog new tricks."

And in this case, the old dog never forgets the tricks he already has learned.
Wade MacDonald made two 3-pointers in an Erskine alumni basketball game as a
68-year-old, and he continues to excel on the tennis court.

He knows the end will come one day -- "Time marches on," he says -- but that day
is nowhere in sight right now.

"I've had a good life," he said. "If things go bad, I can't complain. I've had a
good life."

TENNIS ACE HAD RIGHT MIX OF TOUGH, TENDER

BYLINE: ANDREW MEACHAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER

SECTION: TAMPA BAY; EPILOGUE: KEVIN MANNING; Pg. 6B

LENGTH: 668 words

DATELINE: LARGO



HIGHLIGHT: A skilled player an instructor, the Shipwatch tennis director faced
mortality with strength.


Like other professional athletes, Kevin Manning developed his share of
superstitions. He restrung his own tennis racket each week with a portable
machine, preferably the same day as the week before.

He practiced by hitting a set number of strokes every day: 150 forehands, 150
drop shots, 150 lobs. He braced himself for the worst two days after stringing
the racket because that was "bad racket day" - the day the racket's oddities
might cost him points in a match.

"He was superstitious," said Mary Jane Evertz, Mr. Manning's longtime girlfriend
and doubles partner. "You control the situation to win."

As tennis director at Shipwatch Yacht and Tennis Club, Mr. Manning set exacting
standards for his students. He watched their footwork and service motion as
carefully as their shotmaking ability.

Mr. Manning,a dedicated tennis instructor and recognized player in his age
group, died Monday of cancer. He was 53.

Around the state, Mr. Manning was known for two things: teaching and winning,
especially among men in the 50-and-older age group. He was nationally ranked in
the United States Tennis Association's men's singles; won an international
singles tournament in 2007; and was one of a handful chosen to represent the
United States in the 2008 Fred Perry Cup in Turkey, according to Shipwatch.

His career took a turn in 2008 when he was diagnosed with cancer. Doctors
removed part of his tongue and lymph nodes. He played in Turkey three weeks
after surgery. His team came in third out of 21 participating countries, taking
home a bronze medal.

Other setbacks followed. Doctors found a spot on his lung. Mr. Manning walked
the halls of Mease Countryside Hospital in his tennis clothes, and had Evertz
bring his racket-stringing machine there so he would not miss racket-stringing
day. He continued to teach.

In September 2009, he was throwing a football on the beach when he noticed
discomfort in his right arm. Two months later, he had just completed a serve
during a tennis lesson when he felt extreme pain.

"He said it felt like his arm just flew off," said Evertz, 61.

X-rays revealed a clean break in the arm. Doctors reattached the bone with
screws, but the solution proved temporary. In July 2010, they amputated the arm
Mr. Manning had used all his life to hold a tennis racket.

He stayed tough. "He said, 'This is what I was dealt, and I just have to get
through it and keep going,'" Evertz recalled.

He welcomed students who faced their own challenges.

Sallie Brierley, who has epilepsy, has struggled with her balance. When she fell
down during a lesson, "he jumped over the net," said Brierley, 60.

He put his one hand underneath her and said, "Hold on to me."

"I will remember him for that," Brierley said.

Kevin John Manning was born in Arlington, Va., the son of an Army man. He was a
football nut who also loved basketball. But he was wedded almost literally to
tennis, and never married.

Before coming to Shipwatch, he taught at several clubs, including East Lake
Woodlands and McMullen Tennis Center.

In January, former tennis pro Pam Shriver invited Mr. Manning to attend a
tournament in Baltimore as its guest of honor. He posed for pictures with Chris
Evert, Billie Jean King and Martina Navratilova.

A lifelong Catholic, Mr. Manning had been talking in recent months about death,
and seeing his parents. "If he had to (die), that's what he was looking forward
to," Evertz said.

He came to Shipwatch as his health worsened, and was there the day before he
died.

"Kevin died Monday night, and he was at the tennis club on Sunday morning," said
Shipwatch assistant pro Wendell Walker. "He was there. That's a lot to be said.
People were absolutely in admiration of that."

About 150 people gathered for a recent memorial service for Mr. Manning, held at
the tennis club.

TENNIS, OTHER RACKET SPORTS LOSING THEIR GRIP ON THE PUBLIC

BYLINE: TIM NELSON, Knight Ridder News Service

SECTION: SILICON VALLEY LIFE; Pg. 6E

LENGTH: 351 words


YOU might say tennis is going to the dogs.

The game is in such a slide that Penn Racquet Sports, the biggest ball maker in
the United States, has reported a nearly 30 percent slide in sales since 1991.
The company is now trying to sell dye-free tennis balls -- for Fido.

But it isn't just the "Sport of Billie Jean Kings," as it were, that's
suffering.

Racket sports, from badminton to table tennis, are in a serious slump, according
to a nationwide survey sponsored by the Florida-based Sporting Goods
Manufacturers Association of America. In the past 10 years, according to the
annual survey, just about every racquet sport has shown double-digit declines in
participation.

Racquetball alone is down 40 percent since 1987. Tennis is down 17 percent, and
badminton 35 percent.

But fans of the games say they don't need survey results to know something is
happening.

"I think tennis really hasn't grown for the last 20 years," says Mackie Coty,
manager at the St. Paul (Minn.) Indoor Tennis Club. A longtime tennis player and
a facility manager for almost 30 years, she says the tennis crowd has been
getting older and tournaments are on the decline.

Some fitness clubs have actually removed some tennis courts, and racquetball
clubs are on recreation's endangered species list.

So what's going on?

There probably isn't any single explanation, says Hart Johnson, a six-time
national racquetball champion who lives in St. Paul. Now 34, Johnson has played
for 26 years, and been a keen observer of the game.

He says racquetball is getting fierce competition from soccer and skating --
high-profile activities that show up on television and draw big-money sponsors.

It's not easy, either.

Stiff backs and bad knees are taking their toll among racquetball players, "even
though it's a non-contact sport," Johnson says. Aging baby boomers are instead
turning by the thousands to less strenuous pastimes, such as billiards, up
almost 20 percent in the last year alone, according to the ASD survey.
Activities such as water aerobics and walking also are growing by leaps and
bounds.

Jul. 13--At least women didn't have to burn their sports bras.

Despite a steadily growing legion of women flocking to playing fields and courts
over the years, sporting goods companies have only recently begun to sit up and
take note of the female form. Companies have long been marketing to women, but
sports equipment experts say the products were mainly smaller versions of men's
products, with little focus on differing female proportions.

Apparently, they've seen the light -- and a chance to cash in.

From snow skis to scuba suits, a new wave of kinetically correct goods is
hitting shelves at a steady pace. Newly updated kayaks come with wider, higher
seats and handles that make them easier to hoist. Soccer shoes come with
reconfigured cleats designed to cut down on injuries that plague female players.

The latest?

Head's "Airflow" tennis racket, a lightweight, ergonomic model that offers more
than just a pretty paint job, the company says. Like other new female-friendly
equipment, the Airflow racket was patterned after a woman's physical -- and not
just fashion -- needs.

"We saw a big opportunity to come up with a true performance racket for women
because the industry really hasn't done that," said Kevin Kempin, vice president
of sales and marketing for Head/Penn Racquet Sports. "There have been some
attempts over the years, but they've been mostly cosmetic -- a pink racket or a
racket that's simply just lighter -- so you end up with something that's
patronizing."

Head's Airflow line, which rolled out to Atlanta stores this week, incorporates
three major design components: a superlight weight (less than 9 ounces) that
allows for a faster swing; a lower balance point in the head area to counteract
the loss of power that often comes with the lighter weight; and a tapered grip
designed partially for two-handed backhands.

Head, the second-largest racket seller in the world, started designing Airflow
two years ago, interviewing and testing it with women in Japan, Europe and the
United States, including players in Atlanta and Hilton Head, Kempin said.

"We started with a blank piece of paper and no assumptions... The racket is the
result of what women wanted," he said.

Airflow is aimed not at seasoned pros but at the masses of women who play
recreationally, a somewhat tricky market. More women than men started playing
tennis last year, according to the Tennis Industry Association, and the number
of women who play frequently has also grown in the past three years.

However, racket sales to women have been sliding, and manufacturers are eyeing
new women's products as a way to win some consumers.

The Airflow rackets, ranging in price from $159 to $199, join the crowded field
of new rackets that normally hit the shelves each year.

Wilson, the world's largest racket seller, debuted its "W" line for women last
fall, touting a larger sweet spot, a softer grip and more shock absorption.

It seems like they're late to the game, but companies have had to wait for the
female sports market to reach a critical mass, said Tom Doyle, vice president of
information and research at the National Sporting Goods Association.

"Generally, equipment is designed at the more expert level of a sport, and until
recently, there just hasn't been the same level of participation for women. Men
are more frequent participants in generally every area of sports," Doyle said.
"Look at how long it has taken to get the uniforms just right for women's
sports. And only recently have companies begun to pay attention to protective
equipment, even with simple things like putting a spot for a ponytail in a
batting helmet."

As tennis goes, local retailers say there's no better test market than metro
Atlanta, home to the vaunted Atlanta Lawn Tennis Association, one of the largest
recreational tennis leagues in the country.

"I can really see how the ladies are going to like this racket," said longtime
player Hope Taratoot, who took the Airflow for a test spin Wednesday afternoon.
"I was impressed. It's very lightweight and very easy to maneuver. I had good
control on the ball." (Taratoot has not yet tested Wilson's new racket for
women.) Taratoot, manager of the Your Serve Tennis shop in Marietta, said women
were already asking about Airflow as soon as it hit the racks this week.

Head launched a major marketing campaign in May with tennis legend Steffi Graf,
who helped design the racket. Graf, known for swinging a Wilson racket during
her playing days, is now marketing her name with Head, which sponsors husband
Andre Agassi.

Although Graf's star power is a plus, women in general are starting to expect
equipment that's tailored to them, notes Scott Jones, owner of Serious Tennis,
an Atlanta-based retail chain.

"For many years, products didn't differentiate between male and female
customers. But recently, we're seeing soccer shoes, snow skis and other products
for women that have had very good success," Jones said.

Jones sees a similar opportunity in the tennis industry, which has historically
drawn female shoppers in with apparel more so than equipment.

"I think there could a strong demand for [women-specific] rackets," Jones said.

"What you're seeing now is probably just the tip of the iceberg as far as what's
to come."

Raids as police probe £10m international money-laundering racket

Police today smashed a £10m international money-laundering racket, arresting
nine suspects and seizing luxury cars during pre-dawn strikes across Greater
Manchester.

Officers executed search warrants at addresses in Cheetham Hill, Salford, Hale
Barns, Altrincham, Openshaw, Bolton, Oldham and Sale early this morning.

They seized a number of Porsches, a Range Rover and a Mercedes as well as
designer handbags and shoes, perfume, laptops and a 'significant' amount of
cash.

Seven men and two women aged between 27 and 50 have been arrested on suspicion
of international money laundering.

They remain in police custody for questioning.

Raids as police probe £10m international money-laundering racket

The arrests follow an eight-month investigation into a £10m money-laundering
racket said to be the work of organised crime gangs across Europe.

The raids were conducted by the north west regional crime unit, known as Titan,
and Greater Manchester Police.

Detective Superintendent Jason Hudson, Titan's head of operations, said: "The
coordinated arrests come as a result of an extensive and thorough eight month
long investigation by my team.

"This investigation into money laundering that has a reach far wider than just
Manchester, with criminal operations reaching as far as Paris, and we believe as
much as £10 million may have been moved.

"Along with our colleagues from Greater Manchester Police, we have taken a
significant step today in dismantling organised crime groups who are damaging
communities with illegal money laundering, and the other crime this funds.

"We have seized a number of high-value cars today, which I hope will show the
public that we will and do strip criminals of their assets.

"I send the message to people involved in this type of crime: your actions will
eventually catch up with you and we will knock on your door.

"I would urge decent, law-abiding members of the community who have information
about criminality where they live to share that information with their local
police force or Crimestoppers so that positive action can be taken."

 TENNIS ANYONE?;
 It's never too late --- or too early --- to get started

Eighteen-year-old Venus Williams and her 17-year-old sister, Serena, proved once
again you don't have to be an adult to be fantastic on the tennis court. The two
sisters duked it out two weeks ago for the Lipton Championship title. In the
end, Venus beat her younger sister, but the trophy still went to the same home.

With more than 15,000 juniors playing tennis in Atlanta, there's no doubt it's
popular and a game that can be picked up at almost any age.

History of the game

The origins of tennis are somewhat unknown. Some say a game resembling tennis
was played by the Egyptians and later the Greeks. But it is the French monks in
the 12th century that are credited with developing a game where they tried to
hit a ball off the wall of a courtyard --- hence the name court tennis.

Because many of the Royals were playing the game, it then became known as royal
tennis. The ball was made of cloth, wrapped so it was solid, and players used
their hands to hit it. The players got tired of using their hands and invented
rackets. The modern game of tennis began in 1873 when a British officer
developed it from the earlier game of court tennis.

Pick up a racket

To play, you'll need a racket, a can of tennis balls and a court. There are
rackets designed for kids ages 6 to 10. They are lightweight, shorter in length
and have a large head. Longer junior rackets are designed for ages 8 to 12.

You'll want to wear a pair of tennis shoes and maybe a hat if you're playing
outside. It's nice if you have someone to hit against. Some facilities have
backboards, so you don't need a partner to practice.

Getting started

If you've never played before, you might want to take a lesson from a tennis
pro. In an effort to "Grow the Game" of tennis in the Atlanta area, the United
States Tennis Association and the Georgia Professional Tennis Association will
offer free beginner group lessons May 1-16 at 30 sites in the Atlanta area.
After which, you can sign up for six lessons via the USA Tennis 1-2-3 program or
sign up for USA Team Tennis, which starts July 10. For information, or to locate
a participating facility near you, call 404-327- 5158 or visit the Georgia
Tennis Association Web site at www.georgiata.com.

The Boys & Girls Clubs of Metro Atlanta run the ACE (AT&T Challenge of
Excellence) tennis program at 18 facilities throughout the Atlanta area. More
than 400 kids participate in weekly lessons and annual tournaments. For
information or to become a Boys & Girls Club member (annual fee of $ 15), call
404-527-7100.

Toon into tennis at the Cartoon Network's Smash Tennis, which will be out and
about in the Atlanta area April 24 to 27. Costumed cartoon characters will let
you try your luck at skill contests such as Bedrock Serve-A-Rama, a speed serve
game; Dexter's Ultimate Serving Machine, which works on service return; and the
Jetson's Galactic Blast, which works on the overhead smash. Cartoon Network's
Smash Tennis will be from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. April 23 and 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. April
24 at Piedmont Park and from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. April 26 and 2 to 8 p.m. April 27
on-site at the AT&T Challenge.

So, what are you waiting for? Get out on the court and have some fun.

Finding The Will To Win;
Kania Overcomes Frustrations, Tops Jabeur For Koser Crown

BYLINE: Tim Gross

DATELINE: Lancaster, PA

Sunday afternoon was one for wilted composure and broken tennis rackets on the
sun-splashed stadium court at Hempfield Rec Center, where Paula Kania outlasted
Ons Jabeur, 5-7, 6-3, 6-4, for the Koser Jewelers $25,000 Tennis Challenge
title.

Jamie Loeb and Sanaz Marand defeated Lena Litvak and Alexandra Mueller for the
Koser doubles title.

"It was so tough after the whole week," Kania said of her first pro tournament
win of 2014, her fifth singles championship overall. "We just wanted to win so
much."

Kania's frustrations with early missed shots crescendoed throughout the first
set, as the Sosnoweic, Poland, native slammed her racket into the ground,
scattering buttons as her early 3-1 set lead shrank and disappeared.

"It was only one (service) break," Kania said of her early lead. "It doesn't
mean anything. She's such a good player. She returns very well. If you don't
serve well, the break turns on you so fast."

Kania slammed her racket when Jabeur broke her serve to take a 6-5 advantage
and, after Jabeur won the next point, Kania's frustrations boiled over by her
bench and the adjacent chair judge.

"I hit the racquet," Kania said, "and I hit the referee. I don't know if I hit
him, but it was close to him, and if something would've happened, they would've
just taken me off the court."

The outburst cost Kania a point penalty for a racket abuse violation and gave
Jabeur leverage for a first-set win.

"It's harder to stay focused," Jabeur said, "when she's throwing her racket. You
think that (the match) is over. She's mad, she's not into the game, but actually
you have to focus more to not let her come back."

Kania came back, building another 3-1 set lead, one she held on to.

"It's a new set," Kania said. "It's kind of a new life. I just tried to forget
about what happened and focus on right now."

Up 2-1 in the second set, Kania finished a long point, sending Jabeur across the
court twice for long, reaching shots before putting a winner out of reach.

"My game is to play cross-court," said Jabeur, the first Koser challenge
competitor to hail from Tunisia. "That's what I tried to do, but I missed a lot
of balls."

When Jabeur missed a shot to fall into a 4-1 second-set deficit, she slammed her
racket, drawing a warning of her own.

"When you're mad," Jabeur said, "things happen, and you have to control
yourself. Sometimes it's good to hit your racket, to let all the anger go out."

Jabeur, 176th in the International Tennis Federation rankings, and Kania, ranked
177th, split the first two sets and slogged through the first eight games of the
final set with four games apiece.

Kania rallied against Jabeur's serve to get a break and a 5-4 advantage.

"I couldn't handle my serve," Jabeur said of the final set.

With her flashpoint penalty in the past, and U.S. Open qualifying on the
horizon, Kania finished off the two-and-a-half-hour title tilt with a volley, a
fist pump and the Koser championship.

"All the matches before," Kania said of the Koser tournament, "I was quite calm,
and it was all right. Today, I don't know. Sometimes, (the nervousness) happens.
You can't change it, and you have to play with it somehow."

After the match, both finalists turned their attention to U.S. Open qualifying,
citing the chance to play hard courts in Landisville as a favorable prelude.

"Each week, each tournament is a different challenge," Kania said. "You're
always trying to play your best tennis."

In the doubles final, Marand, a University of North Carolina alum, and Loeb,
entering her sophomore year at UNC, lost the first four points of a first-set
tiebreak but rallied to win, 7-5. The momentum carried them to a quick 6-1
second set.

Some ideas for holiday gifts

BYLINE: By Charlie Garfinkel

SECTION: SPORTS; Racket sports; Pg. B5

LENGTH: 616 words


With Christmas and Chanukah fast approaching, now is the time to buy racket
sport-related items for friends, relatives, or even yourself. We are fortunate
in having three excellent facilities in Western New York where you can purchase
racket-sports merchandise.

They are: JB's Tennis Shop, 5338 Main St., Williamsville, 631-5703; Miller
Tennis Center, 5959 Sheridan Dr., Williamsville, 632-8600; and the Village Glen,
162 Mill St., Williamsville, 633-1635.

Here are some suggestions for holiday gift giving:

>Tennis rackets

*Prince ERXO3 Hybrid Gold: This is one of the most comfortable rackets ever
produced. It has a great, soft sweet spot, excellent damping technology -- which
will help those with tennis elbow -- and is easy to maneuver. The racket is very
reasonably priced at $160.

*Wilson BLX Tidal Wave: Many players and teaching professionals have given this
model accolades. It is one of the most versatile rackets on the market. Its
105-square-inch head and superior balance makes this racket a great choice for
junior players and competitive USTA players. For women the racket comes in an
alternate pink color scheme. The racket is an excellent buy at $140.

*Babolat XS, 102 and 109: The XS frames have been popular with junior and
beginning adult players. The rackets are lightweight, and yet have great
stability and feel. At a price range of $110-120 the rackets are an excellent
investment.

*Junior rackets range in size from 21 inches for the youngest players, 23 inches
for 5-6 year olds, 25 inches for 7-8 year olds, and 26 inches for 9-10 year
olds. However, you have to be cautious. Children at different ages range in
size.

Be sure to take the child you are purchasing the racket for with you to ensure
that you are getting the correct racket size for them.

***

>Footwear

*Adidas Barricade 6.0 Sneakers are great for the serious player who is looking
for durability, comfort and feel. The sneaker is available for men and women at
$110.

*The Prince T-22 is a wonderful sneaker for players who play primarily on hard
courts. It not only looks great but it also has great lateral support and
comfort for $85.

*Nike Court Mo 3: Women will love these sneakers. For only $65 they will get a
great looking shoe that has great lateral support.

***

>Other items

*The Dunlop Aerogel Pro GT retails for $100 and is one of the best selling
squash rackets on the market. It has an unprecedented combination of power and
control.

*Gearbox is fairly new to the racquetball industry but it has progressed
rapidly. It has a wide range of rackets that have proved to be popular to a wide
range of players. The rackets sell in the price range of $70-190.

*Rafael Nadal-Novak Djokovic 2010 U.S. Open Video: Djokovic played the match of
his life in the 2010 U.S. Open men's final against Nadal. His ground strokes
were penetrating, his court movement incredible, and his returns of some of
Nadal's shots bordered on the miraculous. And yet, he lost in four sets.

As good as Djokovic was, Nadal was even better. His performance ranks among the
greatest of all time. Having already won nine Grand slams, he is fast
approaching Roger Federer's astounding total of 16. Nadal is also making a claim
to be the greatest player of all time.

Buying the $24.95 video is a no-brainer. The quality of tennis has to be seen to
be believed.

*Wilson Federer BLX Tour RF Tennis Bag: Use some of your holiday money to treat
yourself. The Federer bag has multiple pockets, a shoe compartment and a thermo
guard that cuts down on exposure to the heat. The flashy looking bag is a
limited edition and isn't cheap at $90. However, it is a Federer bag, and I
guarantee you will be the envy of your opponents.

A trainer at the New York Health and Racquet Club on 57th Street in Manhattan
was in critical condition yesterday after falling seven stories through a glass
panel, the police said.

The trainer, described only as a 31-year-old man, was working at the club at 115
E. 57th Street when he stepped onto a pane of glass atop an atrium that was
covered with brown paper around 11:30 A.M., said Officer Cheryl Cox, a police
spokeswoman.

The trainer plummeted to the tiles below, the police said. He was taken to New
York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, where he was listed in critical condition.

The authorities could not say why the panel was covered or why the trainer was
walking on it.

Toretha Levy, a manager at the club, declined to comment on the fall.

Tennis in Marin: Belvedere rising - women dominate USTA league play to reach
district tournament

BYLINE: Holly Woolard

SECTION: SPORTS

LENGTH: 1262 words


BELVEDERE TENNIS CLUB has become a player and the rest of Marin has been forced
to take notice following impressive showings during United States Tennis
Association league play this spring and summer.

The Belvedere women's 3.5 and 3.0 teams won county championships last weekend to
remain unbeaten and earn trips to district tournaments. Considering BTC has been
in existence since 1957, it's hard to credit one person for single-handedly
pushing the club to the top of the USTA standings at two different levels, but
the impact of general manager Jay Potter has to be acknowledged.

"It's been quite a season for BTC having two teams go undefeated and qualify for
districts," said Potter, who left Rolling Hills for BTC in December.

The Belvedere 3.5 women edged host Rafael Racquet & Swim Club 3-2 to earn their
17th sconsecutive victory this season. Belvedere needed three-set victories from
Rebecca Aherne in No. 1 singles and Margie Barry and Julie Flaherty in No. 1
doubles to earn a coveted trip to the district tournament.

"Throughout the season we had a lot of support from our tennis director, David
Crouzet, and the general manager of BTC, Jay Potter," said captain Anastasia
Zaandam. "Their insights, support and advice were invaluable."

The BTC women head to Broadstone Racquet Club in Folsom Aug. 13-15 to compete
against three other Bay Area champions. At stake is a spot in the sectional
championships at Carmel Aug. 27-29. Sectional champions advance to USTA national
championships in October. ?

The Belvedere 3.0 women's team also had a close one in the Marin finals, but
pulled out a 3-2 victory over Marin Country Club. BTC won its 11th consecutive
match behind an inspirational victory at No. 1 doubles by captain Katie Benson
and her partner Julianne Tantum. Benson was diagnosed with breast cancer four
weeks before the season started, had two surgeries, and still found a way to
play six matches, including the county final. BTC will travel to Sunnyvale
Tennis Center for the 3.0 Districts in two weeks.

The 2.5 women's title was won by Tiburon Peninsula Club with a 2-1 victory over
Marin Country Club. Tiffany Sams won at No. 1 singles, and Cynthia Kenneally and
Julie Soja took a three-setter in No. 2 doubles to seal the win.

The 4.0 women's championship went to Piper Park, which dominated Rolling Hills
4-1. Sharon Skylor and Kit Mustola pushed their record together to 7-0 by
winning the No. 1 doubles match in straight sets. Co-captain Mary Carse won the
No. 1 singles match in a three-setter.

Harbor Point's 4.5 women's team added an exclamation point to an already stellar
season with a 5-0 victory over Marin Tennis Club. Captained by Chrissie
Costamagna, Harbor Point is such a powerhouse that it only lost six individual
matches in 11 team matches this season and did not drop a set in the playoff
final. Among the many undefeated players on the team are Kim Boyden and Kristen
Lehmkuhl, who only lost two games in the No. 1 doubles match during the county
playoff final.

In the 5.0 men's county championship match, Mill Valley beat Harbor Point 2-1.

Dan Hiddleson went a perfect 10-0 to spearhead Mill Valley's championship
season. Dave Allen and Gregory Kennett won No. 1 doubles in straight sets to
secure the trip to Districts.

Rolling Hills, which finished fourth in the regular season with a 6-6 record,
captured the 4.5 men's championship with a 3-2 victory over Harbor Point. Craig
Steiger and Anthony Delario survived a three-setter in No. 3 doubles to deliver
the victory to Rolling Hills. David Mullarkey breezed through the No. 2 singles
matches.

The season has been bittersweet for the Rolling Hills 4.0 men's team, which
defeated Albert Park 4-1. Teammate Ron Bryant survived kidney cancer this year
and rebounded to play in two matches, but was recently diagnosed with brain and
lung cancer. Rolling Hills is having a team barbecue and fund-raiser for Bryant
on Aug. 9, according to captain Jim Shroyer. On the court, Jaime Parady improved
to an 11-1 record with an easy win in No. 2 singles.

In the 3.5 men's final, Marin Tennis Club defeated Rolling Hills 3-2 by sweeping
all three doubles positions. Leading the doubles domination were Randy Tugaw and
Paul Goldfarb in No. 1.

"Marin Tennis Club provides such a great environment for attracting, developing
and supporting competitive and recreational tennis players," captain Clif
Crowder said. "It is also a very social club, which means most of our players
are also good drinking buddies in the clubhouse."

In 3.0 men, Tiburon Peninsula Club defeated Rolling Hills 3-2. TPC, which swept
singles thanks to John Minty and Josh Brier, had been aiming for the Marin title
for seven years. "Needless to say we are pretty excited," said captain Dave
Petrini. "Many of our team members have busy careers and young children. But
hard work from a core group of players and a dedicated weekly clinic at TPC paid
off later in the season as we started to win more matches."

Esurance Tennis ClassicThe field is set for the sixth annual Esurance Tennis
Classic at Harbor Point Tennis and Swim Club Oct. 2-3. Captains for the World
Team Tennis format are Billie Jean King and Anna Kournikova.

King, who founded the WTT, carts a whopping 39 Grand Slams titles into the event
that raises money to fight breast and prostate cancer, and promote youth tennis.
Others in the field include Lindsay Davenport, Tracy Austin, Pat Cash, Murphy
Jensen, Jason Gimelstob and Rick Leach. Adding color to the event will be Bud
Collins.

Gordon Smith via e-mail at gordon@harbor-point.com For more information, go to

TPC ChallengerThe Royal Bank of Scotland Tiburon Challenger is set for Oct.
9-17. The event is sandwiched between Challenger stops in Sacramento and
Calabasas, which should bolster the draw of the pro men's tournament.

Zarraonandia lands at Rolling HillsCarrie Zarraonandia, former coach at Redwood
High who spent three years teaching at Tiburon Peninsula Club, has landed at
Rolling Hills. She joins six-time Grand Slam doubles champ Ken Flach on staff at
the Novato club as QuickStart program specialist.

"This is an exciting opportunity for me," Zarraonandia said. "To be able to
teach alongside Ken - nobody has the experience Ken has."

The game plan has Zarraonandia using the USTA-endorsed QuickStart program to
help young players 6-10 years old learn the basics. As young players progress,
Zarraonandia will pass them off to Flach for that next step in becoming a top
junior player.

"If you start these kids young and they have the right teaching, think about
what they can do," Zarraonandia said. "It's so exciting to think I can pass them
off to a world-class teacher."

Family event at BelvedereBelvedere Tennis Club held a family tournament last
weekend, which drew more than 100 players.

Polo Cowan, general manager at Mill Valley Tennis Club, and his son Polo won the
Advanced Father-Son division. The Advanced Father-Daughter division was won by
Frank and Elizabeth Davis from San Rafael. The Intermediate Father-Daughter
division was won by Belvedere pro Mike Howard and his daughter Kaitlin.

Steven and Katherine Manning of Novato won the Adult Mixed title. The
Adult-Child division was won by Tad and Liza Kinney from Belvedere.

USA competition is about to heat up

BYLINE: NANCY MORGAN

SECTION: LARGO TIMES; Pg. 4

LENGTH: 1166 words


USA League Tennis is in full swing this month with action in senior men's and
women's doubles and mixed doubles in adult and senior divisions.

Twenty-seven men's teams are divided into 3 levels, 19 women's squads in 2
categories, 8 adult mixed in 2 levels and 5 senior mixed teams.

For many competitors, league schedules with prearranged opponents, times and
sites make playing simple.

For other members, the league is a way of relaxing after a stressful day of work
and other responsibilities.

The majority of players say the competition is fun and the social quality is an
added feature. Plus, there always is the hope of qualifying for that coveted
next level and perhaps reaching a national championship.

"We're having fun with our team and will probably fill the maximum 14 spots,"
said Ruby Johnson, captain of the East Lake Woodlands 7.5 adult mixed squad.

"We're a brand new team and I bribed a few to play, but we've started off well,"
Johnson said.

In East Lake's opening match last weekend against Seminole, Barbara Smith and
Ralph King won in the No. 1 position. Margie and David Young's victory gave East
Lake a 2-1 decision.

Other East Lake members are Mary Frances Warford, Laura and Terry Midden, Warren
Smith and Skip Rath.

Winning their first 7.5 adult mixed matches were Royal Racquet Club and Bardmoor
Golf and Tennis Club.

In the two-team 8.5 adult mixed division, host East Lake beat the Racquet Club
of St. Petersburg 3-0, then the Racquet Club evened the score with a 2-1 victory
on its home court.

In 4.0 North senior men's action, East Lake posted a 2-1 win over Royal Racquet
Club.

Midden and Tom Dempster and King and Rath produced East Lake's two points. John
Arnold and Bob Feder won for Royal in the top spot.

Countryside Country Club and the Westin Innisbrook Resort battled three sets in
all three positions in 3.5 North play.

Countryside came out ahead with victories from Fred Elflein and Phillip
Kallauggher (No. 1) and Robert Anderson and Ernest Dubiel. Joe Bailey and Bob
Barry accounted or Innisbrook's lone point.

McMullen's 3.5 men's team has started its season with wins over Royal Racquet
Club (2-1) and Shipwatch Tennis Club (3-0).

"We're definitely off to a good start," McMullen captain John Fleming said.
"We're gradually coming together and improving from year to year."

Fleming inherited the captain position three seasons ago from longtime McMullen
leader Jack Turk.

The first year, Fleming said, the squad did not win a match. Last season, it
managed one victory. This year is a sign of progress, Fleming said.

"Dick Lambert, Ron Whitcomb and myself have been with the team for some time,
and we're working on developing some good doubles combinations," Fleming said.

"We have regular practice times and are trying for some consistent play among
the teams."

In last weekend's match with Shipwatch, McMullen's John Colaneri and Jacob
Voreis defended the No. 1 spot, Whitcomb and Gregory Gamache played at No. 2 and
Fleming and John Johnston were No. 3.

Rounding out the McMullen team are Charles Coflin and Dick Dzik.

Seminole Lakes Racquet Club notched its third straight victory in the Senior
Men's 4.0 South with a 3-0 score last weekend against Feather Sound Country
Club.

Winning were Larry Daum and Jim McCook (No. 1), Jim Johnson and John Beda and
Red Garry and John Leavengood.

It was Daum's third straight victory and McCook's first match since playing on
the national-bound 4.0 adult regional team. Beda maintained his unbeaten record.

McMullen's 3.5 women's squad posted a 3-0 win in its match with St. Petersburg
Tennis Center over the weekend.

Producing McMullen's victories were Caryle Red and Cathy McTaggart (No. 1), Pat
Stefka and Peggi Defreitas and Eileen Kitzmiller and Nancy Haugen.

"I think most of us enjoy playing the USTA leagues because we get to play
against some different players than during the week," said Stefka, McMullen's
captain.

"A big motivation, too, is the hope of going on to the playoffs," she said.

The other McMullen members are Dorothy Frost, Helen Pugh, Judy Morris, Bea
Casanova and Roberta Cameron.

USA League Tennis will break for the holidays after the Dec. 23 matches. Play
will resume the first weekend in January.

Action continues through the end of February, when state tournament teams will
be determined.

AGASSI ACCUSED OVER 'ILLEGAL' RACKET

BYLINE: Peter Higgs

SECTION: Pg. 94

LENGTH: 242 words


WIMBLEDON referee Alan Mills will inspect Andre Agassi's racket following
allegations that it is illegal.

The matter was drawn to the referee's attention yesterday after a TV viewer
claimed a device on the racket designed to lessen vibration broke the rules.

Many players have a vibration dampener on their racket, usually made of rubber,
to lessen the chance of elbow and wrist injuries.

But the rule says the device must be near the racket handle and outside the
crossed strings.

The TV viewer claimed Agassi's vibration dampener was on the prohibited area.

The 23-year-old from Las Vegas recently changed from a Donnay to a Head racket,
claiming that the Head gave less resistance and protected the wrist injury which
threatened to keep him out of the championships.

Mills was shown a picture of the racket yesterday and said: 'It's not clear from
the picture whether the vibration dampener is on the crossed strings. I would
have to see the racket and it will be checked before Agassi plays on Monday.'

* Tennis bosses have passed on a dossier on obsessed fans to police and security
guards at Wimbledon.

The authorities were told of the players being stalked, including Germans Steffi
Graf and Anke Huber, before the championships.

A Wimbledon insider said: 'The All England Club have passed on details on
certain individuals. There is an ongoing dialogue and the police and security
are kept informed.'

THE ABATEMENT of aircraft noise over the United States Open in New York has
enabled the world's finest tennis players to interpret shots by cocking an ear
to the sound of the balls as they leave the strings of an opponent's racket.
This is part of the Stradivarius Syndrome, which has grown in importance with
the advancement of racket technology.

So much power is now available from synthetic frames that leading players are
tempted to change rackets at the drop of a point. In some cases this is done to
improve performance. In other cases, money talks.

Most rackets have merit, and the choice comes down to what suits a player best.
With so much emphasis placed on psychology these days, gurus frequently
outnumbering the umpires and linesmen, it seems odd that players are willing to
trade the security of a trusted racket for the uncertainty of a stranger.

The defeat of Monica Seles by Linda Ferrando in the third round of the US Open
provoked much discussion. Some attributed the 16-year-old prodigy's loss to the
limitations of her fast and furious two-fisted game, a style good enough to win
all but one of her previous 44 matches and land her the French Open title in
June. Others were aghast that she and her handlers had neglected to do their
homework and did not realise that her opponent had an attacking game. And could
the new racket have been a factor?

Seles recently traded her Prince for a Yonex. The change did not prevent her
from defeating Martina Navratilova in Los Angeles three weeks ago, nor did it
appear to inhibit her in the opening rounds at Flushing, which she won, 6-0,
6-0, and 6-2, 6-2. Ferrando did mention, however, that the balls did not seem to
arrive as fast on Friday as when she practised with Seles in Chicago in
February. Was this because the indoor carpet court was slicker than Flushing's
concrete, or did the racket have something to do with it?

The proverb about good workmen not blaming their tools applies as much to
big-time tennis as to other spheres of activity. Generally, however, it takes
time to adjust to a new implement. Ian Woosnam discovered this with golf clubs,
and it would probably take months for Steve Davis to break in a new cue.

John McEnroe imagined he could put more power in his elbow by borrowing a couple
of Head rackets from a practice partner, Goran Ivanisevic, on the eve of
Wimbledon. A first-round defeat by Derrick Rostagno persuaded the New Yorker
otherwise, and he is back with old faithful, the Dunlop with which he once
dominated the game.

Mats Wilander lost a good deal of desire for the game after winning three of the
four Grand Slam championships in 1988, and his subsequent performances were not
helped by a financial wrangle between his agents and racket manufacturer. Having
achieved his success using Rossignol, the Swede picked up a Prince days before
the Italian Open. The switch was temporary.

Andre Agassi announced himself two years ago by winning six grand prix titles
and then swapped his Prince for a Donnay in a deal estimated to be worth pounds
4m. Suddenly, the cocky youngster was no longer whipping forehands past his
rivals, and he reverted to Prince for a time while gradually gaining confidence
in the new racket on the practice courts.

Martina Navratilova temporarily forsook Yonex three years ago, convinced that
she could only out-hit Steffi Graf if she obtained the Dunlop racket used by the
West German. She lost to Graf in the French Open final, and then defeated her at
Wimbledon. Since working with Billie Jean King, Navratilova has realised that
experience can be a potent force allied to a positive attitude.

Boris Becker sports a new racket logo, but he admits that Estusa are producing
the Puma frames fundamental to his game. Ivan Lendl's long association with
Adidas ended when he struck a deal with Mizuno, but the former world No. 1 has
been pounding ground strokes with his old favourite at Flushing Meadow.

It took Jimmy Connors a long time to loosen his grip on a metal- framed Wilson
in order to entrust the autumn of his career to Slazenger. Rod Laver tried an
aluminium Chemard and was a grounded ''Rocket'' until reaching for a disguised
Dunlop. Even maestros find it hard to play an old tune on a new fiddle.

Over-60 tennis team shows mettle at event

BYLINE: MATT KANE - CORRESPONDENT

SECTION: SECTION A; Pg. 2A

DATELINE: PALM SPRINGS, Calif.


PALM SPRINGS, Calif. The Racquet Tennis Center in New Smyrna Beach got some
national exposure Oct. 17-19, when a team of eight men represented the facility
at the United States Tennis Association (USTA) Super Seniors 2005 Nationals held
at the Riviera Resort and Racquet Club in Palm Springs, Calif. No trophies
returned home to Florida with the team made up of Gary Culton, Marvin Schild,
Andy Aylward, Robert Bernhard, Lee Fritchie, Carl Kiernan, Gerald Verrelli and
Ron Bruckert, but they did bring home key chains and barbecue sauce gifts from
the Hawaii and Kansas City teams. The Racquet Tennis Center team, representing
the Florida region, earned respect at the national over-60 tournament, the first
for the New Smyrna Beach-based team, by beating Hawaii, Missouri and Eastern
(New York) before losing to Mid Atlantic (Maryland area) in the semifinals.

Its always better to win, but getting to the final four was an achievement, team
co-captain Schild, of New Smyrna Beach, said.

We were very pleased we beat three other teams. Both Schild and team captain
Culton, of Port Orange, admitted that the team members seemed nervous going into
the tournament.

I think everybody was a little bit nervous to start out, Culton, 67, said.

When we won a couple matches we started getting a little cocky. We went into the
semifinals thinking we were good, but we found out the other team was better.
But we are happy with what we got. We went out with the attitude that we would
do our best. Schild, who didnt want his age mentioned but is the elder statesman
of the team, also saw the uneasiness in his teammates, but also gives credit to
the Mid Atlantic team.

I think everybody was nervous that was out there because it was the first time
any of us had been out there, he said. To be perfectly honest, I think (Mid
Atlantic) was the better team. If we played them five times they would beat us
four. Even though the national hardware went to different teams, the experience
was well worth the trip for the men.To play guys from different parts of country
and find out how we rank against them is exciting. We usually only play guys
from Florida, said Culton, who is retired from the post office. Seeing guys
across the net representing different state and areas of the country was the
highlight for Schild.

I think the experience was fantastic. Because there were teams from all over the
U.S. and Hawaii, we got to mix with people we would not have met before, said
Schild, who started playing tennis at 16, and went on to play at the University
of Miami and in the Army.

We got to exchange ideas about things you wouldnt think about.Schild said ideas
about politics, sports and world events were shared. And the tournament stressed
more than just tennis.Its about tennis but they also want to promote
understanding of people in other areas of the country, he said. The doubles
tournament was made up of 16 teams representing the different sections in the
country and the matches were two sets with a 10-point tiebreaker. The Florida
team won 3-0, 3-0, 2-1 over Hawaii, Missouri and Eastern, respectively, before
falling 2-1 to Mid Atlantic in front of a small following that was made up of
their wives. They qualified for the tournament by winning the Florida regional
tournament in April.

The tennis was terrific. We were surprised with a team coming from Hawaii. We
and the Hawaii team came the longest distance, Schild, a retired attorney,
explained.

The quality of tennis was excellent because you had to win your section to get
there. The competition was terrific.

Three squads land title in men's regional championships

BYLINE: NANCY MORGAN

SECTION: NEIGHBORHOOD TIMES; Pg. 30

LENGTH: 923 words


Three adult league men's teams weathered the rainstorms and opponents last
weekend to capture USA Tennis Florida regional championships and berths in next
month's state tournament.

Finishing first were the Racquet Club of St. Petersburg's 3.5 squad, Seminole
Lake Tennis center 4.0 and McMullen of Clearwater 3.0.

The only second-place team from the area was Treasure Bay's 4.5 men, who were
edged by Naples. Placing third were women's squads, St. Petersburg Country Club
(2.5), Countryside Country Club (3.0) and Royal Racquet Club (4.0). Fourth were
the Renaissance Vinoy's 3.5 and Treasure Bay's 4.5 women's teams.

The Racquet Club of St. Petersburg presented a strong effort, said captain Bob
Steele, and utilized 13 players in the three-day event. Competing against four
squads, the Racquet Club relied on new singles players Joe Damouny and Don
Cobin, who combined to win six of eight matches.

"A big difference for our team was winning all five of our third-set
tie-breakers," Steele said." "That took a monumental effort. We used several new
doubles combos that worked well."

Steve Uebel and Don Campagna won three matches, and Ray Cianci teamed with Neel
Voss to claim three consecutive wins.

The Racquet Club beat Sarasota 3-2, Tampa 4-1 and Naples 3-2 to reach its final
against Fort Myers (2-1) with a 3-0 record.

"We knew we were in the driver's seat against Fort Myers unless they beat us
4-1," Steele said. "We only needed to win two of the five positions to win. We
were at 2-2 when we had a rain delay with Steve and Don still on court."

Not needing to continue the match, but neither team willing to default, play was
to resume. However, a Fort Myers player had left, forcing a default and giving
the Racquet Club a 3-2 win.

"It was tough playing at this level and so far, it's been a great ride for us,"
Steele said. "We have a lot of good players at the club, and our director, Andy
Veal, is generating enthusiasm and developing skills. We're now 15-1 and headed
to the state sectionals, and we're excited about that."

Other Racquet Club players competing were Dave Lesser, Paul Haaglund, Lon
Caffee, Tom Stewart, Pete Gairing, Vaughn Haight and Steele. Rounding out the
team are Marshall Craig, Russ Barlow, Jim Nieset and Jim Montgomery.

Seminole won 17 of 20 matches in its quest for a second straight title. With a
28-0 mark in Florida contests, Seminole hopes to mirror last season's results,
which ended with a trip to nationals.

"After last season, we could only keep three players from the team that went to
nationals," Seminole captain Red McGarry said. "So, we formed two teams, with
this team taking Brian Cooper, Scott Chambers and Dave Heeder."

McGarry credits a total effort for the regional title and hopes to keep that
momentum continuing to state.

Scoring seven of eight singles wins for Seminole were Cooper, Jeff Mars and Lou
Scaglione. McGarry scheduled Steve Baccich, Mike Hooper, Chambers, Heeder, Don
Kirby, Ken McWilliams and Gary Lucke in various doubles combinations that won 10
of a possible 12 matches.

Other players included Greg Burke and Todd Legault.

"I was happy I was able to schedule everyone to play a least twice, and with 13
players, that was tricky," McGarry said. "When Kevin Hayslett is able to join us
at state, that will give us a fourth singles player."

Seminole beat Naples 4-1 and Sarasota and Fort Myers 5-0. In a 3-2 win over
Tampa, Scaglione posted a 6-1, 6-1 decision in No. 2 singles for Seminole and
was joined by Baccich and Chambers winning in No. 2 doubles and Kirby and
McWilliams at No. 3.

"That was a tight one against Tampa, and we knew it would be," McGarry said. "It
was a big match for us to win. At the time, we were 1-0 and Tampa was 2-0. We
worked as a team the whole time, and it paid off for us."

After finishing second at regionals the past two years, McMullen beat Punta
Gorda and Sarasota 5-0 and Marco Island 4-1 to qualify for state.

Treasure Bay's 4.5 men beat Fort Myers 5-0, Tampa 3-2 and Sarasota 3-2, but a
3-2 loss to Naples thwarted any chance of advancing.

"It was close and the matches were tough," Treasure Bay captain Steve Talner
said. "Our team is pretty even, and I was able to use everybody. We won nine of
the 12 doubles matches and five of the eight singles. That shows how close it
was."

Paul and Steve Reilly were 4-0 in doubles for Treasure Bay.

The state tournament is Aug. 13-15 at Florida Tennis Center in Daytona Beach.
Winners advance to the national championships.

SIMMONS ADVANCES: Joan Simmons of St. Petersburg posted a 3-0 singles record to
help Tampa's 4.5 squad to a regional title.

THE SCOOP: Former playing and teaching professional Alice Valentine has traded
in her competitive racquet for Ali Scoops, an ice cream shop on Fourth Street in
St. Petersburg. Valentine, who played the Canadian and European tours in the mid
1970s, competed in qualifying tournaments for the U.S. Open and Wimbledon
championships and has been nationally ranked in the women's 35-and-older
division. In 1984, Valentine played on the 5.0 national championship team. For
13 years, she operated What a Racket, a tennis specialty shop in St. Petersburg.

JUNIORS: Emily Dvorak, Molly Smith and Anthony Barrancotto have been selected to
represent USA Tennis Florida in the U.S. Tennis Association 12 Zone
Championships, July 28-Aug. 1 in Nashville, Tenn. In all, 20 girls and 20 boys
were invited to compete in singles, doubles and mixed against USTA sections
Caribbean, Mid-Atlantic, Midwest and Southern.

SQUASH: REBELS IN PEACE TALKS

BYLINE: RICHARD JAGO IN QATAR

SECTION: THE GUARDIAN SPORTS PAGE; Pg. 14

LENGTH: 262 words


NEXT month's men's event at the English National Championships in Manchester
will be cancelled unless a peace plan thrashed out with the Squash Rackets
Association yesterday is agreed by the players who have been threatening a
boycott for the past fortnight.

The SRA considers that the disruption over who will and who will not play could
make any draw farcical, unless the rebels change their stance by January 4. But
the SRA does not say how many must change their minds.

Four out of the top 10 - including the British national champion Peter Marshall
- are said by the SRA to support its new initiative, by which the association
would abolish England selection criteria for the championships in return for
players' commitment to any future national championships with an agreed minimum
prize-fund.

Negotiations between the SRA chief executive Chris Gotla and England's captain
Phil Whitlock in London lasted several hours.

The rebels, who originally demanded increased prize-money and a reversion of the
title to British National Championships, appear to be divided. "I thought
something could have been worked out but it seems that I was wrong," Whitlock
said after yesterday's negotiations. "The vast majority think it is unworkable."

Gotla said: "It is frustrating rather than disappointing that a small element
seem willing to jeopardise everything without even offering to discuss the
matter.

Philip and I agree that the future of not only the national championships but
the whole professional game in this country is at stake."

Racquet Experts Match String and Swing

BYLINE: By JACK CAVANAUGH

SECTION: Section 12CN; Page 12; Column 3; Connecticut Weekly Desk

LENGTH: 1192 words


THE busiest tennis racquet stringers in the state work year round in a small
two-story frame house in Darien. On a recent morning Fran Bouton and Carmen
Minning strung racquet after racquet in what used to be the family room of Ms.
Bouton's home. The outdoor tennis season may be over, but business is booming at
Gut Reaction, the business operated by the two women.

Nearby, Chris Hayes of Greenwich, who teaches tennis at the Shippan Racquet Club
in Stamford, was busily stringing racquets, too, before hurrying off to classes
at Fairfield University, where he is a senior. Mr. Hayes, who played varsity
tennis at Fairfield last spring, is a part-time employee at Gut Reaction, but he
works full time during the late spring and summer. An apprentice, Fran McKinney
of Stamford, was at work on the fourth computerized Babolatstringing machine,
which shared the cramped space with a vast stock of gut and synthetic stringing
material, racquets to be strung and various other tennis accouterments.

Without ever advertising, Gut Reaction, which began 14 years ago as a one-person
operation in Ms. Bouton's kitchen, has evolved into an enterprise that needs
four people (five in the summer). They string an estimated 5,000 tennis racquets
a year, far more than any sporting goods store in the state.

The business has grown through recommendations, Ms. Bouton said. "People come in
to have their racquets strung, and then they tell their friends about us," she
said. "And most of them keep coming back."

Finding Gut Reaction is not easy. Ms. Bouton's house is set back about 125 feet
from Hoyt Street, which is also known as Route 106, and the only indication of
the business is a small sign on the mailbox at the foot of the driveway.

'I Have Better Control'

During the course of a recent interview, a steady stream of customers came to
the house to drop off or pick up racquets. Most chatted briefly with Ms. Bouton
and Ms. Minning, both of whom are accomplished players and former instructors.
The subject, always, was tennis.

"I can't believe how well I'm playing since you did my racquet," said a young
woman in a warmup suit. "The stringing has made a tremendous difference in my
game. I have better control."

Those words were music to the ears of both Ms. Bouton and Ms. Minning, who said
that a good stringing job can not only improve a player's game but also reduce
arm stress.

"Dead strings in a racquet can cause a lot of problems, and most players don't
realize how much difference new strings can mean," said Ms. Minning, a Stamford
resident, who had been a customer at Gut Reaction for about five years before
giving up her job in commercial real estate and going to work for Ms. Bouton
last February. She became Ms. Bouton's partner three months later.

50,000 Racquets in 14 Years

The gauge of the string is also important, Ms. Minning said. "A hard hitter will
usually need a thicker gauge string," she said, "while someone who doesn't hit
the ball hard can use a thinner gauge."

Ms. Bouton, who estimated that she has strung as many as 50,000 racquets in 14
years, said she enjoyed the work, even when she did it for eight or nine hours
at a time.

"It's not boring, because we take pride in what we do, and we have fun doing
it," she said. "And there are always people coming in."

Most of Gut Reaction's customers play at tennis clubs and public parks, but some
have their own courts, including the actor Gene Wilder, who lives in Stamford
and has been a customer for years.

Ms. Bouton, Ms. Minning and their employees prepare racquets for most players at
the Shippan Racquet Club in Stamford and the King's Highway Tennis Club and the
Wee Burn Country Club in Darien. Gut Reaction is also the official tennis
stringer for the West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills, Queens.

"We do about a thousand racquets a year for West Side members," Ms. Bouton said.
The club's pro, Paul Gerken, "brings them all in and picks them up while on his
way from his home in Wilton," she said.

Mr. Gerken, a native of Norwalk, was ranked among the top 20 players in the
world when he was a touring pro in the 1970's, until his career was cut short by
a torn rotator cuff.

From 1981 through 1986, Ms. Bouton also strung racquets at the United States
Open tournament in Flushing Meadows, Queens. Among her clients were stars like
Jimmy Connors, Mats Wilander, Yannick Noah and Martina Navratilova. Photos of
Ms. Bouton and many well-known pros whose racquets she has strung adorn her
walls. In addition, she was invited to prepare racquets during the French Open
in Paris in 1984 and 1985.

"Stringing at those tournaments was a great experience, but it just took up too
much time and kept me away from my business," she said.

New Career for a Nurse

Ms. Bouton worked as the head nurse in the outpatient department at St. Joseph
Medical Center in Stamford while raising two daughters. Playing and teaching
tennis at the King's Highway Club, she became interested in stringing, while
watching the club pro, Jeff Gocke.

"I tried it and liked it and then realized that there weren't many places where
you could get a racquet strung," Ms. Bouton said. "Jeff encouraged me to keep
stringing, and I borrowed $500 from my mother and bought my first stringing
machine, which I set up in my kitchen.

"At first I was mainly doing the racquets of players from King's Highway. As
business picked up, I taught my eldest daughter, Laura, who was then in high
school, how to string, and she began to help me." Laura, now 25 years old,
strings racquets at a club in Tucson, Ariz.

Ms. Bouton eventually outgrew her kitchen and moved downstairs to the family
room, where she worked alone for about five years. Now, she said, she may be
outgrowing the family room and, indeed, the house. Because of the increasing
popularity of graphite and composite racquets, fewer players request gut strings
than in the past, she said.

"About 20 per cent ask for gut, which is still the best string, while the rest
are content to use synthetics, most of which play pretty well," Ms. Minning
said. The gut strings -- which come from cow intestines and are not cat gut, as
many people believe -- range in price from $40 to $48, while synthetic strings
are from $25 to $28.

During the summer, stringers at Gut Reaction will prepare up to 60 racquets a
day.

"It usually takes about a half-hour to string a racquet, and if we have the
time, we'll do it while people wait," said Ms. Bouton, whose younger daughter,
Cheryl, is a student at the University of South Florida. "A lot of our customers
are in a hurry to have their racquets strung. And a few have left them outside
the door in the middle of the night, because they want them that same day."

Most requests are met, she said. But some are outside the realm of possibility,
like the one made not long ago by a woman customer.

"She asked us to please string her racquet so that it would give her topspin on
her backhand," Ms. Minning said with a smile. "We can do a lot of things with
tennis strings, but not that. And so we had to explain to her that that just
wasn't possible."

Racquet War success shows Pasco goofed

Considering the charms Michael Cox has unleashed to bring a certain local
newspaper columnist - *blush* - around to his point of view regarding the
proposed west Pasco softball complex, you would think he was locked in a steel
cage death match over his political future, and an approving nod from This Space
would make all the difference. (For the record: He's not.)

To be fair, Cox would like everyone to love the softball-a-palooza plan that
bears his stamp if not (yet) his name.

Alas, my objections stand. A reckless misapplication of tourist tax receipts,
the project is generic and endlessly replicable, subjecting it to competition
from similar parks in neighboring counties. Moreover, the eagerness of unelected
top brass inside the West Pasco Government Center to promote it to the top of
the to-do list sacrificed the county's built-in connections, expertise and
advantages in what could have been a regionally unique tennis complex.

Racquet War a winner

A reminder of just what appointed Pasco officials tossed out a couple of years
back was on display last weekend.

Racquet War, the brainchild of Memphis, Tenn., entrepreneurs Robin Barringer and
Oakley Foy, attracted roughly 140 tennis players to Saddlebrook Resort for a
three-day tournament that didn't end until well after sunset Sunday. About half
the competitors were commuters. The other half - from such cities as Destin,
Orlando, Pensacola, Atlanta, New York, Chicago and even Phoenix - produced, on a
typically slow, first-weekend-after-Labor Day, about 210 overnight stays, says
Saddlebrook owner Tom Dempsey.

That's 210 overnight stays for a first-year event organized by a real estate
agent and a promoter of cheerleader uniforms and camps. Next year, Dempsey says,
"he thinks they'll have 250."

"Maybe 300," says Foy, who has reserved Sept. 9-11, 2011.

The tournament was where?

The first Racquet War at Saddlebrook succeeded with virtually no marketing
assistance from Saddlebrook, no county tourist-development funding and no
dedicated structure touting the tournament's location. Without a Pasco National
Tennis Center to point to, Foy and Barringer pitched the site as "Tampa."

Listen, I know lamenting the loss of the tennis stadium falls into the category
of "Dead Horses, Beaten." And Dempsey has made it abundantly clear that even if
the door cracked open again, he's unwilling to recreate the bundle of assurances
that the place would succeed magnificently.

Still, once upon a time stadium supporters imagined plenty of weekends such as
the one just past, attracting amateur players from across the South who would
play and stay, a calendar punctuated by a couple of weeklong professional
events, college tournaments and more. But, never mind.

For now, we simply wish Foy, Barringer and Racquet War a long, happy and
remunerative association with Saddlebrook, even as we nurse skepticism about the
dubious use of tourist tax dollars proposed for Starkey Ranch wetlands.

What the pros and experts use

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 14C

LENGTH: 213 words



Here's what rackets the tennis pros are using this week at the U.S. Open, along
with the rackets some experts use and why:
- Andre Agassi: Donnay Agassi oversize.

- Boris Becker: Puma Becker midsize.
- Jimmy Connors: Slazenger Phantom wide body.
- Steffi Graf: Dunlop 200 Max midsize.

- Ivan Lendl: adidas Lendl standard.
- Martina Navratilova: Yonex RQ 180 wide body.
- David Hirschfeld, co-owner, Holabird Sports Discounters: ''I play with
anything available, if it's a wide body. It gives you a more powerful game, yet
it's easier on the elbow and arm.''
- Ram Ramnath, aeronautical engineer at MIT, a racket tester: ''Right now, I
like the Yonex RQ 200, a wide body. This particular racket is very good for feel
as well as power. It has a very true trajectory and doesn't cause any pain in my
arms.''
- Bud Collins, NBC tennis commentator and Boston Globe tennis columnist: ''I
endorse the Spalding Big Easy. It's a wide body, oversize, you name it, with
Sensathone. Don't ask me what that is.''
- Mary Carillo, CBS and ESPN tennis announcer: I use the Prince 190. It's not a
wide body. I don't have the right grip on shots to make the most use of wide
bodies.''
- Ed Fabricius, communications director for the U.S. Tennis Association: ''A
Dunlop Max Fly. I liked it when I picked it up, sort of like how you decided
which baseball bat to use as a kid.''

- And one of the better known players this year, President George Bush: Prince
graphite, oversize.

What a racquet: Jana Novotna empathized with racquet problems of her
quarter-final opponent, Magui Serna. "She broke a string at the beginning of the
second set, and I knew that from that point on she wasn't quite happy with the
racquet, or maybe it was a little too tight or something. I felt that her balls
started to be a little shorter after that."



Drop the puck: Anna Kournikova's No. 1 fan and good friend, Sergei Fedorov, has
for the most part moved easily through the ranks of the unwashed this week,
signing autographs when asked. Yesterday, after Kournikova's elimination, he
even fielded questions from a media scrum. "It's not the end of the world that
she lost today," he said. "She was coming back from a very serious injury, so
you'd expect her to have trouble going too far. She's doing her best." Fedorov
reiterated that he is "just a big fan" of Kournikova and that he enjoyed the
fact she received more attention than he did. "With the long layoff I had last
year [because of a contractual squabble with the Detroit Red Wings of the
National Hockey League], I played a lot of tennis. It's great. There's a lot of
good players right now and a lot of women. What could be more attractive than
women?"

Graf spree: Steffi Graf, who was eliminated on Thursday, accepted a wild-card
into the main draw next week at the Pilot Pen tournament in New Haven, Conn.
Novotna, Arantxa Sanchez Vicario and Kournikova are also scheduled to play in
the event as a warmup to the U.S. Open.

Martina's magic: Reason No. 3,400 to like Martina Hingis. After yesterday's
1-hour 57-minute win over Sandrine Testud, RDS tennis announcer Hélène Pelletier
-- whose on-court, post-match interviews have been splendid -- accidentally
referred to Hingis as Monica. While the crowd laughed and Pelletier covered her
face, demure Hingis took the microphone and said with a laugh, "That's okay . .
. I've had worse this week."

Sisters in a golden racquet

BYLINE: LEO SHCLINK

SECTION: Pg. 101

LENGTH: 403  words


ALICIA Molik and Samantha Stosur have been given a gold-plated incentive in
their bids to halt Serena Williams' advance on a third Wimbledon crown.

Williams, the 2002-03 champion, and sister Venus, the 2000-01 and '05 winner,
will use Wilson racquets embedded with 22-carat gold inlays.

Copying Roger Federer and Maria Sharapova's use of gold-dusted shoes, the
Williams sisters are being ''honoured'' for their performances this year by
their sponsor Wilson on the sport's greatest stage.

Serena, who could play Molik in the second round and possibly Stosur in the
round of 32, will use a pure black racquet. Venus will wield white frames.

''I can't think of a better place to play with a racquet made with real gold
than Wimbledon,'' Serena said with the type of hype likely to stick in earthy
Stosur and Molik's craw.

The Williams siblings will donate money to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation
through racquet sales. But philanthropy will be the least of their concerns over
the next fortnight.

''Wimbledon means so much to me,'' Williams said. ''This is where I want to play
my best tennis.''

Williams, winner of eight grand slam titles, has been labouring at Palm Beach
Gardens since her French Open quarter-final thrashing at the hands of eventual
winner Justine Henin.

''Well, since I lost, unfortunately, I had to go back home to the very, very hot
conditions in Florida,'' she said.

''So losing was a punishment for me to train.

''If I had won, then I would have been able to not endure the 200-degree
weather.

''I didn't take my opportunities in Paris.''

Williams opens her quest against Spain's Lourdes Dominguez Lino before meeting
either Molik or Russian Anastasia Rodionova.

Molik has not played the younger Williams since Miami 1999, when she lost in
straight sets. Her first concern will be getting over Rodionova, who is ranked
five places higher at No. 69.

Triumphant in the French Open doubles, former world No. 8 Molik retains the
grasscourt artillery to excel while Stosur, the 27th seed, faces Puerto Rican
qualifier Kristina Brandi.

Stosur edged Brandi in a tight Eastbourne clash last season and, after a tough
first-round meeting with Nicole Vaidisova at the same venue this week, the
Queenslander will be anxious to simply survive.

Perth qualifier Casey Dellacqua and Queensland veteran Nicole Pratt clash in the
first round with the winner advancing to a probable engagement with Czech 14th
seed Vaidisova.

Kiefer's flying racquet has Frenchman fuming

BYLINE: DAVID REED

SECTION: SPORT; Pg. 48

LENGTH: 790  words


MELBOURNE

A European stoush broke out at the Australian Open yesterday after German
Nicolas Kiefer threw his racquet across the net in an apparent attempt to
distract French opponent Sebastien Grosjean during a spiteful quarterfinal.

Kiefer prevailed in a gut-wrenching 96-minute final set to win 6-3 0-6 6-4 6-7
8-6 but Grosjean was seething after the match.

"I didn't know you are allowed to throw your racquet when you play," Grosjean
said. "If a ball drops from my pocket, or even the hat, we replay the point. But
it didn't happen like that."

The score was 6-5 in the fifth set when Kiefer threw his racquet as Grosjean
moved for a high volley. The Frenchman missed the volley and lost the point but
was so incensed he called for tournament supervisor Mike Morrissey to make a
ruling on whether Kiefer was guilty of hindrance. But Morrissey accepted central
umpire Carlos Bernades' view that Kiefer's racquet toss had not affected
Grosjean's shot.

The rules of the game state: "If a player is hindered in playing the point by a
deliberate act of the opponent(s), the player shall win the point."

On those grounds, Grosjean should have been awarded the point.

Replays of the incident are inconclusive on whether Grosjean saw the racquet
before he failed to make his shot. Uncertainty from Bernades on whether Kiefer
meant to throw his racquet could have made the umpire reluctant to award the
point to Grosjean. But the Frenchman had no doubt as to what should have
happened. "I think I deserved a let and we replay the point, that's the minimum.
And maybe he has to give me the point because he's not allowed to throw his
racquet if the point is not over," he said.

Kiefer said he had apologised to Grosjean and that the pair were good friends
but the Frenchman told a different tale in his press conference, saying he never
heard any apology, adding: "I mean 'friend' is a big word, I think. No, I think
I was a little bit disappointed in the way he threw the racquet on such a big
point ... that's not the way."

Kiefer defended himself against charges of poor sportsmanship, saying he was a
tense person who was "cooking" on the inside.

"Everybody has to understand, there are so many emotions and so much tension,"
he said. "You fight for four and a half hours and it happens. I thought ... I
had lost this point, then all of a sudden after he missed, the racquet went
over.

"Of course, it's not nice, but what can I do? I'm a person with so much tension.
I was surprised that I got this point, but I took it. We shouldn't talk only
about this, there were so many close calls, especially in the tie break. I mean,
(the) first point, it's clearly out, (the umpire's) not overruling it."

Kiefer now plays Roger Federer in the semifinal after the Swiss edged out
Russian Nikolay Davydenko 6-4 3-6 7-6 7-6 last night.

Raheil Qureshi, the managing squash racquets professional at the host Washington
Squash Racquets Club, won his quarterfinal qualifying match, 3-0, over John
Shellenber yesterday to advance to the semifinals of the third annual Summer
Grand Prix Series.

Qureshi, top-ranked in the area, will face professional Neil Vohr, who defeated
Anil Kapur, 3-0. Second-seeded Tom Matthews, Capitol Hill Racquet Club managing
professional, beat Jim Lubowitz, 3-0, and will play amateur Will Carlin, who
upset professional Ray Rodriguez, 3-2.

The tournament, which attracted 146 players, some from as far away as New York,
Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, is one of the largest summer squash tournaments
on the East Coast.

"Washington is the fastest-growing city for squash in the nation," Qureshi said.

Area's top juniors set to play in elite state tournament

BYLINE: NANCY MORGAN

SECTION: LARGO TIMES; TENNIS; Pg. 4

LENGTH: 1095 words



Junior competitors are making last-minute preparations for the USTA Florida
Section Closed Junior Championships that begin Saturday at sites in the Orlando
area.

Only the top 64 players (they must be Florida residents) in each of five age
divisions are invited to what many consider a springboard to national tournament
play.

"To compete and win in our state closed tournament puts a player on a long list
of highly recognizable winners," said Maria Cercone, tennis director at the
Bardmoor Golf and Tennis Club. "Some players need to do well in this tournament
to get into our quota for nationals, while others - if already ranked nationally
- can use the state closed as a tuneup for summer national tournaments."

Such is the case with Alexandria Liles of Largo. The 14-year-old was selected to
join the U.S. national 14s team this year and is training at the Evert Tennis
Academy in Boca Raton under the tutelage of Jose Lambert and Ian Meyer, former
coaches of Monica Seles.

"I'm using the state closed as a practice tournament to prepare for nationals
this summer," said Liles in a phone interview from the academy. "I think I've
improved my all-around game and am now more of a player of the game instead of
just a hard hitter."

Liles will be among the top two seeds in the girls 18-and-under division. Local
players joining her in the tournament will be Tiffanie Kalvoda and Sydnie
Zillig.

Competing in the 16s will be Kelly Nelson, Kaela Kennedy and Jennifer Dent.
Among the 14s are Katie Fenzl and Bugsy Bauer, who is coming off her first
national tournament win in three attempts. Laura Caffee, Morgan Frank, Christina
Liles, Rachel Silverberg and sisters Keilly and Courtney Ulery are in the 12s,
and Alexandra Cercone is in the 10s.

"This is Alex's first state closed tournament, and I want her to have fun," said
Maria Cercone of her daughter. "She's only 8 years old and I want her to be back
playing in the 12s. It's important that they have fun now even while they're
getting experience and learning their game."

Ben Kronk, Reinaldo Valor, R.J. Murray and Jon Brett are among the 18s while
Haley Dodson, Carl Fenzl, Fred Johnson and Patrick Gleason are in the 16s.

"I think I've improved on my consistency while I've been training for the state
closed," said Kronk. "I'm a smarter player than I was six months ago."

Kronk, an incoming senior at Tarpon Springs High School, is coached by his dad,
Paul Kronk, a former world-ranked professional player. Kronk said injuries have
limited his competition recently but that he feels ready for this weekend's
competition.

George Navas, Brandon Pierpont and Marc Sawyer will challenge in the 14s;
Nicholas Berning and Sonny Kennedy in the 12s, and Brandon Anandan and Creighton
Blanchard in the 10s.

Competition continues through June 22. A 64-draw satellite tournament is June
20-24 in Orlando for juniors not eligible for the closed competition.

USA PLAYOFFS: USA Tennis League playoffs conclude Saturday, with winners
advancing to regional competition next month in Longboat Key.

In women's competition, Feather Sound Country Club and East Lake Woodlands won
in the 3.0 division last weekend and face off at 9 a.m. Saturday at Feather
Sound. East Lake's 3.5 team can wrap up the title at Innisbrook, but an
Innisbrook win would tie East Lake with the Feather Sound-Lakewood Country Club
winner.

The Racquet Club is unbeaten in its first two 4.0 playoff matches and hosts the
Vinoy at 11 a.m. The Vinoy, like Innisbrook, could be a spoiler and force a tie
with a win. Then the Racquet Club and the East Lake-Treasure Island winner would
have 2-1 records, and a tiebreak counting total positions won would be utilized.

In men's competition, Saturday's matches will determine outright champions. The
Vinoy hosts the Racquet Club at 1 p.m. in the 3.5 division; the Racquet Club is
at Seminole Lakes Tennis Center at 10 a.m. in 4.0, and Royal Racquet Club plays
at the Treasure Island Recreation Center at 1 p.m. in the 4.5.

TNT WIMBLEDON: Royal Racquet Club has been chosen one of three area facilities
to participate in this month's TNT Wimbledon GRASSroots Promotion sponsored by
Turner Network Television. The promotion marks TNT's scheduled 60 hours of
broadcast time during Wimbledon.

From 10 a.m. to noon June 24, Royal Racquet Club and its staff will coordinate
an adult mixer, followed by lunch at noon and a Wilson Demo activity from 1 to 3
p.m. The first 100 to register and pay a $ 5 fee for the event will receive a
free T-shirt. Call 799-3200 for other information.

The other two facilities tagged for the TNT promotion are the St. Petersburg
Tennis Center (893-7301) and the City of Tampa Tennis at Hillsborough Community
College (679-1041).

PROS LEAGUE: The Pinellas Pro League meets at Lakewood Country Club June 22 for
its bi-weekly round-robin match play. Tennis directors and other teaching
professionals are encouraged to attend the session beginning at 7 p.m.  Call USA
community coordinator Jeff Davis at 360-6543.

NATIONAL CAMP: A USA Wheelchair Tennis National Junior Camp comes to the area
next week under the direction of chief instructor Nancy Olson, a world-ranked
wheelchair player and coach. Juniors of all ages and levels will participate in
warmup activities, movement exercises and games at the University of South
Florida June 22-25. For information, call camp directors Tina Dale at (561)
279-2612 or Andi Dyke at (954) 968-3434, ext. 214.

NET SHOTS: Linda Thomson and Betsy McKenna rallied from a first-set loss to
defeat Janet Eschenroeder and Caroline Sezionale 3-6, 6-1, 6-0 in the second
annual Tennis Heaven USA Ladies Invitational Doubles Tournament Sunday. Thomson
and McKenna were finalists last year, losing to Eschenroeder and Jane Flynn.

Tennis Heaven USA, currently based at the Sheraton Sand Key Resort under the
directorship of teaching professional Carl Gavine, is seeking a director for
another resort located on Florida's east coast. Call Gavine at 593-6015.

COMING UP: The St. Petersburg Tennis Center hosts its SPTC Junior Open Saturday
through Monday for players age 18 and under. Call Al Sarmiento at 360-2643. The
Tennis Challenger Series 2000 for players 16 and younger begins at 1 p.m.

Sarasota Bath and Racquet Athletic Club for a nine-day run April 15-23.

The tournament has grown from a $25,000 event when tournament founder Tony
Driscoll brought it to the area in 2008 to be played at the Racquet Club at El
Conquistador in Bradenton. It grew steadily during its six-year run at the
Tennis Gardens on Longboat Key and then was held the past two years at the
Lakewood Ranch Athletic Center.

Now the tournament moves to the Bath & Racquet Club, one of the oldest and
largest tennis facilities in the area, a place that held one of the early
Virginia Slims women's tournaments in 1976, an event where Chris Evert beat
Evonne Goolagong for the title in a field that also included a young teenager
named Martina Navratilova.

The Sarasota Open has also had a rich player history, with past winners
including Kei Nishikori, Sam Querrey, Nick

Kyrgios and James Blake.

"The Sarasota Open has been so fortunate to be held at such prestigious
facilities as the Longboat Key Club and Lakewood Ranch Athletic Center,"
Driscoll said.

"The Bath and Racquet is the best demographic location in Sarasota, being
centrally located for all residents in both Sarasota and Manatee counties," he
said. "The club has a long history of being the go-to place for players to
congregate, play and keep close ties together in the Sarasota tennis community."

The move to the Bath and Racquet has been anticipated for several months,
starting when Driscoll became the general manager of tennis at the facility and
the hesitation of the Lakewood Ranch facility to continue hosting the event. The
move allows Driscoll to have more control over the setup of the tournament and
he plans to soon move his entire tournament operation staff to the club.

Paul Lederman, the director of Athletic Center Operations at Lakewood Ranch,
said that with the number of members using the courts there, it didn't make
sense to continue to host the tournament.

"We are content with hosting the college event we have here," Lederman said
about the collegiate tournament held annually at the club in November. "It just
wasn't in our plans moving forward.

"We wish the tournament success at the Bath and Racquet Club."

The Bath & Racquet is currently undergoing major renovations and there are plans
to build a new stadium court that offers permanent seating for the tournament by
combining existing courts No. 1 and 2.

"We are excited to have a vested interest and positive effect on the club and
offering the finest world class tennis in Southwest Florida for all of
Sarasota," Driscoll said.

The increase in prize money (up from $100,000 in 2016), allows the tournament to
potentially attract higher ranked players and also lock down what Driscoll
believes is an attractive week on the tennis calendar. The new dates for the
clay court tournament are a week later than they were in 2016 and a little
closer to the French Open (May 28-June 11) as players make a transition from the
hard court season to clay courts.

Tickets for the tournament will go on sale to Bath & Racquet members and
existing ticket holders on Aug. 19 at the tournament website
(www.sarasotaopen.com) or by calling 941 444-8039 or 888 374-7834. Tickets will
be available to the general public at a later date.

In addition to the Sarasota Open, the Bath & Racquet, which hosts the Men's
50-over National Clay Court tournament in October, is bringing a pair of major
area events to the club.

Brandi's Wish, a tennis event designed to raise awareness about the dangers of
prescription drug addiction, moves from Longboat Key to the B&R and will be held
Dec. 11. The event includes music, entertainment and a tennis exhibition in
addition to a tennis tournament.

The B&R will also host the newly formed Sarasota County Championships, scheduled
to be played Jan. 6-8. Various levels of play will be available in the USTA
sanctioned event. A website (www.srqchampionships.com) is being constructed and
will be available to accept registrations beginning Sept. 1.

DATELINE: West Essex



April 2, 2001 11:17: "AGONISING" was how coach Neil Harvey described Peter
Nicol's decision to switch allegiance from Scotland to England, a move which was
accepted by the Squash Rackets Association last week.

World champion Nicol, 27, is Scottish by birth but has defected to take
advantage of the far-superior funding available south of the border.

Nicol moved to Chingford in 1991 in order to train with expert coach Harvey at
Connaught Squash Club.

Harvey told the Guardian: "This was a very difficult moral dilemma for Peter
which he agonised over for a long time.

"He has repeatedly been asked the question of how he will feel when he first
pulls on an England shirt. But he feels that whenever he plays squash he is
playing for himself.

"Scotland have benefited enormously from the fact that he was born there, but he
has received very little support from their Squash Association and everything he
has acheived in the game has been down to his hard work.

"Peter feels he is the world no.1 first and a Scotsman second."

The package which will now be available to Nicol, via a GBP 1.1m Lottery grant
to assist England's best players, will be worth an estimated GBP 30,000 a year.

The funding will pay for his travel and hotel expenses as well as coaching,
including a high-tech video analysis system.

Harvey added: "I wouldn't say the lack of support from Scotland has hindered
Peter's development as a player, in fact it has made him more determined to
prove what he can do by funding himself.

"But when we were in New York for the Tournament of Champions this year, he
realised the outstanding quality of the facilities available to the English
players."

The Scottish Squash Association has reacted angrily to Nicol's decision and may
try to pursuade the Scotland Commonwealth Games Council to prevent him from
representing England in Manchester next year.

Nicol, who won Commonwealth gold in 1998, said: "I hope it doesn't happen that
the world no.1 cannot compete at the Commonwealth Games, which is a showpiece
event for the sport.

"My involvement has to be sanctioned by Scotland and at the moment they won't do
it."

Harvey added: "The Scots are upset because they have lost a very good chance of
winning a gold medal. But if they stop him playing, they will totally devalue
the squash competition."

LENGTH: 74 words


A lot of new equipment is not needed to take up tennis. A pair of sneakers with
good support, an inexpensive racket and a can of balls should suffice. If you
don't have a racket, most tennis centers and sports stores have various kinds of
demo rackets that you can rent for a small fee. If you then decide that you want
to continue playing and want to purchase a racket, this is a good way to find
which racket is most suitable for you.

Title tourney ends Junior League play

More focused practices, opportunities to compete at other facilities and an
introduction to tournament play are among the benefits to those who participated
in the Pinellas County Junior League.

Beginning in mid October, 18 teams in three age divisions competed weekly.
Participating clubs were Royal Racquet Club, the McMullen Tennis Complex in
Clearwater, East Lake Woodlands Country Club and the YMCA North Pinellas.

Last weekend, Royal Racquet Club hosted the championship matches in each
division.

"If it were not for this league, kids at this level would have no place to play
except at their own club," said Jane Belansky, tennis director at the YMCA North
Pinellas.

"This league is a great experience for the kids and they love to go to other
clubs to play different players."

Belansky's 14-and-under, two-player squad of Dan Staffiera and Abhi Lokesh
defeated Royal Racquet's A team for the title.

"Both of these players want to make their high school teams so this is great
practice for them," said Belansky, who has been at the YMCA for 10 years.

"Dan is a real steady player and Abhi is developing some big shots."

This was East Lake's first season in the league and the club's 14-year tennis
professional, Jake Bryan, was pleased.

"This league gives the kids, especially the younger ones, the chance to play
matches that are not intimidating," Bryan said. "The league gives you a taste of
tournament competition without the big-time pressure of sanctioned tournaments."

East Lake's 12B team of Bartlett Tyler, Ali Robertson and David Sebba finished
first among six teams and beat the YMCA in the final.

To reach the 14B final round, McMullen's White team first had to finish among
the top four in the seven-team division and then beat Royal Racquet Club's White
team in a semifinal. Against Royal's Red team in the title match, wins from Jake
Gerlach and Dan Counts in singles and Gerlach and Sam Wiand in doubles clinched
the championship.

Rounding out the McMullen squad were Jordan Ollestead and Ariana Zayac.

"Definitely, the practices became more focused while the kids looked forward to
playing the matches," said Tomas Ollestead, Clearwater's teaching pro at the
McMullen Tennis Complex. "They get to play matches at their own level and I know
they like feeling they belong to a team."

The league is coordinated by Vince Trapano, teaching professional at Royal
Racquet Club, and offers six weeks of competition for a fee of $ 30.

"I've tried to make this volunteer-friendly and easy for anyone to participate
in," Trapano said. "All you need is a minimum of two players to fill two singles
and a doubles position. More and more parents are getting involved as they
realize their kids improve in their lessons when they play matches."

Trapano plans to offer another session at the end of January. For details,
contact Trapano at 799-3200 at Royal Racquet Club.

Saturday from noon to 2 p.m., Trapano and the Royal Racquet Club staff will be
hosting a Junior Fun Day for players 8 to 15. A $ 10 fee includes pizza, prizes
and a benefit for the Humane Society of North Pinellas. Call the club or e-mail
royalrc@aol.com today.

LEAGUE LEADERS: At the midway point in the Pinellas Area Doubles League,
Bardmoor III leads the 26-team women's doubles league with 44 points, followed
by a three-way tie for second place among Countryside II, Feather Sound and
Racquet Club I.

with its 3-1 win against Vinoy II in a north-south playoff. After finishing
first in the north among four teams, Bardmoor played south division winner Vinoy

Proctor.

In other playoff action, the south's second-place Vinoy I defeated north's

Rookie Upstages Agassi

BYLINE: By ROBIN FINN

DATELINE: INDIAN WELLS, Calif., March 13


With the throat of his racquet cracked from the battering it took from trying to
field sonic serves, and with a lump in his throat as he pondered fending off the
juggernaut across the net, Andre Agassi let himself become discombobulated and
let his rookie opponent become a semifinalist for the first time.

The hurricane from Spokane, Wash., Jan-Michael Gambill, the golden child with
the golden serve, selected the Newsweek Champions Cup to make his grand entrance
to the circuit. After out-acing Mark Philippoussis and outworking Jim Courier in
the previous rounds, the 20-year-old Gambill, who was facing the resurgent
Agassi for the third time in a 1998 quarterfinal, validated himself tonight with
a 7-6 (8-6), 3-6, 6-3 victory.

Agassi ruined his break of Gambill in the third game of the final set by
thumping out two double faults in the course of failing to hold serve. And once
Agassi's racquet broke in the fourth game, so did he.

Then it was just a matter of time before Gambill, with his 18 aces and a
devastatingly accurate double-fisted rallying style that conjured memories of
Monica Seles at her most dominating, pulled off the upset.

"In the second set I felt like I was breaking him down, but then my racquet
started to feel wrong, and the throat cracked, and I had to go to a new racquet
and that just rattled me," said Agassi, who, like the 126th-ranked Gambill, has
jumped 100 spots in the rankings since both were toiling on the satellite
circuit last fall.

Agassi said that Gambill, the more-than-savvy rookie who received a wild card
into this event after Boris Becker withdrew, is no fluke. "There's no question
about it; he's the best of the young guys coming up," Agassi said.

At 84, Bob Luxembourg is the face of area tennis ... and he's too busy to slow
down

SARASOTA

When Bob Luxembourg turned 70, he did not hesitate to tell his friends what he
wanted for his birthday.

"I used to kid people, saying I would make a deal with the devil if I could have
10 more healthy years," Luxembourg recalls. "Ten more years, then I would say
goodbye and that is OK." When that 80th birthday arrived and went, and he felt
fine, Luxembourg revised his goal, saying, "OK, I am going for 90 now."

Luxembourg should start thinking about 100 because, at the age of 84, he is way
too busy to slow down. Though a wrist injury has curtailed his ability to play
tennis, Luxembourg is never far from the game. He simply puts his energy into
ways to promote the sport. He has founded a magazine - Totally Tennis - that
exceeded his expectations and has become a must-have for anyone interested in
area tennis. He promotes half a dozen tennis exhibition matches and attends
almost every tennis-related event that is held around the area. Passionate and
energetic, he is a mover and a shaker in what he calls the sport of a lifetime.

"It is what is keeping me young," Luxembourg says. "I feel like I am 64. I am
not making money at it but I am having fun."

Tennis has almost always been fun for Luxembourg.

It started for him around the age of 5 when he would serve as ball boy for his
father. Born in Brooklyn, Luxembourg was playing tennis by the time he started
elementary school and rarely was far from a racket.

And he often won, beginning in high school and continuing through college and a
short stint in the Air Force.

As it often does, life and jobs have a habit of getting in the way of first
loves but Luxembourg kept involved with the game. And shortly after he married
his wife, Nordis, who he calls the love of his life, Luxembourg left the
printing business and returned to his second love in 1962 by building
Westhampton Racquet Club Resort on Long Island.

"I did it despite a lot of family objections and some people thinking I was
crazy," Luxembourg said.

What started as a tiny ramshackle place with three courts and seven members in
1962 grew to 50 members in a year's time. And by the time Luxembourg sold the
place 20 years later, it had 15 courts, 40 marina slips, 16 motel rooms, an
Olympic-sized pool, a restaurant ... and nearly 300 members.

"Most of the members were from New York and drove me crazy," Luxembourg said
about the decision to sell.

The plan was to move to San Diego but Luxembourg had a chance meeting at a
tournament with Ken Wagstaff, the owner of the Sarasota Bath and Racquet Club.
Wagstaff sold Luxembourg on the virtues of Sarasota and invited Luxembourg to
play doubles in the national 45-Over tournament held at the Bath and Racquet.

By 1980, the Luxembourg family called Sarasota home - "I fell in love with
Sarasota," Luxembourg said.

Since the move, Luxembourg has served as tournament director for countless
events, helped design the tennis facilities at The Plantation in Venice and The
Landings Racquet Club in Sarasota and also served a stint as tennis director at
The Landings.

He has also won many tennis matches, but none as satisfying as earning a gold
ball in 2003 by winning a national father-son title with his son, Erik.

A little while ago, Luxembourg got a Father's Day card from his son, who wrote
that what he remembers most is how fearless Bob Luxembourg was when they played
doubles together.

He was also fearless off the court, starting a tennis magazine at the age of 80
and - with the immeasurable help of Kathy Whyte - building into a 32-page
bi-monthly color production.

"Kathy is such a wonderful person. I think of her as my daughter," Luxembourg
says. "She is such a great editor and art director."

Though he has yet to make a profit on a single issue, Luxembourg takes
satisfaction in how many people tell him they read the magazine and love the
contents.

"To me it is a great success," Luxembourg says.

In his spare time, Luxembourg and Nordis, who skied for Norway in the 1956
Olympics in Cortina, Italy, tend to their growing garden.

"It is an energy I have inside to do things," he says about staying busy. "It is
in my DNA I guess."

About New York;
A Gradual Fade To Memories At the Baths

BYLINE: By SAMUEL G. FREEDMAN

SECTION: Section 1; Page 33, Column 1; Metropolitan Desk

LENGTH: 831 words


Hyman Cohen, the manager of the Brighton Beach Bath & Racquet Club, was sitting
in his office when his assistant arrived. ''Just lost another one,'' he told Mr.
Cohen. ''She went into a nursing home.''

The assistant handed Mr. Cohen a membership card with a photograph of an elderly
woman, hair curled and face tanned to a midsummer bronze. She had belonged to
''the Baths,'' as everyone calls the club, for more than 20 years. Mr. Cohen
shook his head and said, ''Send her the refund.''

There have been many similar moments at the Brighton Beach Baths in the past few
years, too many, in fact, for its own good. The longtime members are dying, or
going into nursing homes, or moving to Florida, and their children and
grandchildren are spending their summers in the surf at the Hamptons, not here
beside the Brooklyn boardwalk.

Nobody knows precisely how long the Brighton Beach Baths can hang on, with its
steam room and its swimming pool, its line dancing and its duplicate bridge, its
oddly affecting gingerbread architecture. The plan - at least the plan of the
owners, Alexander Muss & Sons -is to raze the 15-acre anachronism and build
2,200 condominiums and a health club on the bones of a thousand and one pinochle
games.

Some members of the club and a few residents of the surrounding neighborhood are
trying to fight the conversion, but theirs seems to be a losing battle, for the
opponent is not a rapacious landowner or the inexorable march of profit so much
as it is time itself. At 80 years of age, the Brighton Beach Baths is not much
older than many of its members.

Where 13,000 members frolicked in 1971, now only 3,270 linger. In the last year
alone, 587 regulars departed or died. The other day, as Mr. Cohen was
reminiscing about the photographs hanging in the entrance hall, two of the
remaining members entered. One wobbled in with a walker, the other sat in a
wheelchair, which an attendant guided.

Mr. Cohen turned and stepped into the courtyard next to the tennis courts. On a
brilliant July afternoon, only one of them was occupied. ''We're watching
something that was fabulous,'' he said, ''but it's not here anymore.''

The demise can be measured in more than the tennis traffic. The Brighton Beach
Baths stopped holding its beauty contest a few summers ago because there were
too few teen-agers for much competition; the ''Gorgeous Grandma'' pageant,
however, has dozens of entrants. Almost every happy memory leads to a sad
comparison with the present.

''We used to have every big-name band here,'' said Jack Verschleiser, a
73-year-old retiree from the kosher poultry business. ''We had Vincent Lopez, we
had Harold Stern, all those guys. At night there was dancing. This was the most
beautiful place in the world at one time.'' He paused, shifting from then to
now. ''These days, it's like an old age home,'' he said.

''A lot of people feel very scared,'' said Willie Chelmow, a member since 1942
who gives his age only as ''75-plus.'' ''Anybody who's had something their whole
life is afraid of losing it. They don't want to be sitting in a bench along
Ocean Parkway.'' Hadn't Mr. Cohen encouraged longtime members to join the new
club? ''They know they'd be welcome,'' Mr. Chelmow said. ''They don't know if
they'll be comfortable.''

And comfort is something the Brighton Beach Baths offered in abundance - not
material so much as emotional. Even in its dotage, the Baths evokes a sense of
neighborhood.

Each member rents his own ''bathhouse,'' which is really more on the order of a
hall closet, and most tenants decorate them -floral wallpaper here, a ''girlie''
calendar there, radios, cigars, even a toy telephone. The bathhouses are
arranged along a gridwork of cement lanes, marked by shingles announcing
''Gentleman's Alley,'' ''Great Men Only'' and ''Jerry's Bar.''

Like any decent community, Brighton Beach Baths has its own gazette, the
Beach-Nut Bugle. Mr. Chelmow began it in 1959 as a one-time lark for his
friends, but word spread and Hyman Cohen eventually gave money to underwrite it.
He even let Mr. Chelmow convert a Coca-Cola stand into a newsroom.

The result is rich and riddled with schmaltz. A typical edition of the Bugle
includes ''Society Chit-Chat'' by Mildred Tennenbaum, a list of
''Daffy-Nitions,'' and a column of ''Quotable Quotes,'' most of which Mr.
Chelmow heard from Borscht Belt comedians but attributes to his friends.

''What I'm proud of,'' Mr. Chelmow said, ''is that the Bugle has outlasted six
New York dailies.''

The question, though, is how much longer the club can last. In the waning
sunlight, there is something lovely and timeless about the club, from the
buildings that look like a set for ''The Music Man'' to the portraits of past
beauty queens, bouffant hair-dos suggesting their era.

Even at the table where Esther Stein and her friends hold their regular Thursday
mah-jongg game, the subject of age is skirted. ''We're all 39,'' Mrs. Stein
said. ''It's like 'Lost Horizon.' ''

Two firms vie for club redo deal

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

Aug. 23--City Hall says it has whittled to two the number of firms competing for
a contract to design an ambitious renovation of the Racquet Club.

Ken Fisher, who manages recreation programs for the local government, says the
two firms beat out three others to become finalists. The two are the IBI Group,
an international firm with offices in Park City, and VCBO Architecture, which is
based in Salt Lake City.

"I was hoping to get a couple more, but I think we had some good proposals,"
Fisher says.

City Hall interviews with representatives of the firms are scheduled Aug. 25.
Fisher says he hopes to present the Park City Council a contract with one of
them on Sept. 11. The elected officials must approve the contract, which Fisher
expects will be for between $500,000 and $700,000.

Fisher anticipates the firm City Hall selects will finish a final set of designs
by late next winter. Construction is scheduled to start in spring 2009, and a
builder will be selected later. City Hall has set aside $8 million for the
Racquet Club renovation, with the City Council endorsing the renovation during
budget talks earlier in 2008.

Park City officials have considered upgrading the Little Kate Road facility for
years, and there have been a series of improvements in the 22 years since City
Hall purchased the Racquet Club.

Fisher has said the planned renovations would be the most significant, however.
He has said the redone Racquet Club will not be "the Taj Mahal or anything like
that," but it will be "very nice."

Officials last spring engaged regular Parkites in talks centered on what should
be built in the renovated Racquet Club, with a crowd reviewing the options
during a May open house. The ideas have drawn a limited amount of criticism,
though, based on what the work is expected to cost.

The Racquet Club is one of City Hall's most popular recreation facilities, with
people from across the city and from elsewhere visiting it for workouts,
swimming, tennis and basketball, among other offerings.

Playing well at 12;
Metro Atlantan could be women's tennis star

BYLINE: Kelly Milner Halls

LENGTH: 475 words


Move over, Venus. Clear the way, Monica. There's a new rising star in women's
tennis. And when she's not training at Bollettieri's Sports Academy in
Bradenton, Fla., the 12-year-old calls Atlanta home.

Who is this glistening kid star, hand-picked by the man who trained tennis
superstars Andre Agassi and Monica Selles? Her name is Jamea Jackson, daughter
of former New Orleans Saints and Atlanta Falcon football player Ernie Jackson.
Last year, she was a sixth-grader at Flat Rock Middle School in Fayette County.
This school year, the family is also setting up house in Florida so that Jamea
can get the best tennis attention possible.

"This girl's got wheels," says Nick Bollettieri, the super coach at the Florida
academy.

Jamea first picked up a racket when she was 7, but even then she was thinking of
the future.

"I had just finished up a season playing T-ball," she says, "but my parents said
there was no future in it. Since I already knew it was fun hitting a ball, I
decided to try tennis."

Four years later, Jamea is considered the best 14-and-under player in the U.S.
Tennis Association's Southern section, which covers nine states.

"I've watched Jamea play over the last year and a half," says Bill Ozaki,
director of player development for the USTA Southern section, "and she has great
physical skills --- great speed, agility and hand-eye coordination. And all
those things are important. But what makes her really good is her love of
tennis. That enthusiasm helps make her game."

"The competition is pretty fun," Jamea admits, "because I really love to play.
But sometimes I get nervous the night before a match."

When that happens, Jamea does some of her favorite things.

"I do whatever it takes to relax. I watch TV or read a book like 'Sweet Valley
Twins,' or I do my homework before I play."

"I love school," Jamea says. "I think it's important not to just think about
tennis. Doing a lot of things helps with your mental attitude. And a good mental
attitude is important to playing your best game."

Jamea says her dad helped her learn that "if I wanted to be really good, I would
have to keep a good mental attitude."

Before Jamea signed at the Florida academy, she practiced on Atlanta courts for
two hours a day, up to six days a week --- "every day it didn't rain," she says.
She puts in twice the hours in Florida, but says time flies when you're having
fun. "I'm like 'Whoa, is it really time to go already?' "

"I want to be No. 1 in the world," says Jamea, whose favorite pro is Venus
Williams. "So I work hard and do my best. I try to keep my techniques tight, and
I listen to my coaches. But my dad always says, 'you've got to do the hard stuff
yourself,' and he's right. Tennis is a very individual sport. If you want to be
good, you've got to do it yourself." e-mail: nfk@ajc.com

 Jamea's advice for tennis-lovin' kids:
 Winning can't be your main mission, she says.
 "I love to win. And I win a lot. But if you want to play well, you
 can't worry about winning. You have to worry about improving your game.
 You're going to lose when you first start playing tennis, so don't worry
 about it. Just go out on the court and have fun. And keep at it."
 Graphic :
 Five facts to power your game
 1. Keep fit. Do sit-ups and leg squats. Lift light weights several times
 a week to keep your body strong.
 2. Lighten your racquet. A lightweight racquet will put more speed and
 power into your swing.
 3. Use your wrist. Lighter racquets allow you to snap your wrists, again
 to speed up your swing.
 4. Load your legs. In other words, keep your weight with your racquet.
 Your weight should shift along with your racquet.
 5. Overhit in practice. To grow more confident, practice bashing the
 ball hard when you're not in competition. That way you'll learn how hard
 you can hit and still keep the ball in play.

Newcomer wins his first tennis championship

When Matt Fox relocated to St. Petersburg, not only did his job change, but  the
26-year-old made a commitment to tennis.

"I've played tennis since I was 13," Fox said. "I decided when I came  here I
was going to join a club, get involved and play more tennis."

Last weekend, Fox completed his first B singles championship among 14  players
at the Racquet Club of St. Petersburg. A hard-fought two-set match  with Scott
Stewart gave Fox his first title.

"I only joined the club two months ago," Fox said. "I like doubles, but  I'm
much more competitive in singles. I had never played Scott before, so I  did not
know his game. I knew it would be tough."

Fox won 7-5, 7-6 (7-3).

"I think what made the difference was I attacked the net a lot - that's  not my
usual game - and it was tough for him to pass me," Fox said. "Scott  had a good
forehand and kept moving me around. I was just relieved that it was  over, and I
won."

Mal Kilbride rallied from a first-set loss to defeat Ken Heretick 3-6, 6-2,
6-3, for his first men's A championship.

"Mal is a strong 4.0 player with nice strokes and one who utilizes the  court
well," said Hans Gallauer, the Racquet Club's manager and director of  tennis
with Dave McCain. "Mal knows how to work a point and looks for his  opponent's
weakness."

The women's singles club championships are scheduled this fall.

DAVIS ON HARD COURTS: Jeff Davis of St. Petersburg finished third in last
month's National 40 Hard Court Championships in Tucson, Ariz. No. 3-seeded
Davis was competing in his first 40-and-over age division tournament after
finishing first in Florida in the men's 35-and-over division in 1996.

Davis defeated Wesley Jackson of Albuquerque, N.M., for the third-place  finish.

Next month, Davis will compete in the 16-player draw of the Atlanta Senior
Invitational.

INNISBROOK WINS SATELLITE: Innisbrook defended its title in the Satellite
Ladies Doubles League by outscoring 10 teams and earning 229 points.
Countryside Racquets was second with 208, followed by Treasure Island (201),
the Vinoy (197), Countryside Strings and Vinoy Advantage (194), Eastlake  (185),
Seminole Lake (184), Feather Sound (164), Racquet Club (160) and  Shipwatch
(143).

PADL RESULTS: Royal Racquet Club II captured the Pinellas Area Doubles  League
among 21 teams with 79 points. Countryside I also earned 79 points, but  lost
its head-to-head match with Royal. Treasure Island, the Vinoy, Eastlake I  and
II, Innisbrook, Paradise I, St. Petersburg Tennis Center and Safety Harbor  Spa
all finished in the top 10.

SOUTH PINELLAS LEAGUE: Registration for the fourth session of the South
Pinellas Ladies Doubles League continues through May 14. Teams consist of two
doubles positions in the 3.0 and 3.5 levels.

St. Petersburg Tennis Center won both divisions last session among 12  teams.

To register or for information, call Sam Vuille at 867-9105.

SINGLES LEAGUE: Eastlake edged Seminole Lake in the Pinellas Suncoast  Singles
League. Royal Racquet Club was third, Tierra Verde fourth, Bardmoor  fifth and
Countryside Country Club sixth.

PTA LEAGUE: The Treasure Island Golf, Tennis and Recreation Center begins a  new
session of Play Tennis America on Saturday. The session is sponsored by  the
U.S. Tennis Association and is an attempt to interest new or returning  players
to tennis. Call 360-6062 to register.

QUESTION BOX

BYLINE: By Ray Corio

SECTION: Section 1; Page 27, Column 1; Sports Desk

LENGTH: 997 words


QUESTION: Has there ever been a major league game in which a team scored in
every inning?

Since 1900, it's been done twice in the National League and four times in the
American League, but no team has done it in 23 years. Both National League teams
scored in all nine innings, but all four American League teams scored in only
eight innings because they were at home and never batted in the ninth. The most
recent occurences in each league took place in Chicago, where the White Sox
defeated the Boston Red Sox, 12-8, on May 11, 1949, and the Cubs were beaten by
the St. Louis Cardinals, 15-2, on Sept. 13, 1964. The linescores for each
winning team in those games: May 11, 1949 White Sox 1 1 2 1 2 1 1 3< TH>x - 12
Sept. 13, 1964 Cardinals 2 1 2 2 2 1 3<T H>1 1 - 15 The only other time a team
scored in all nine innings took place in Philadelphia on June 1, 1923, where the
New York Giants took the measure of the Phillies, 22-8, in the following
sequence: June 1, 1923 Giants 4 2 1 1 5 5 1 2 1 - 22 That game saw the Giants
collect 23 hits - 5 apiece by Heinie Groh, Ross Youngs and Jimmy O'Connell -and
the Phillies commit seven errors. QUESTION: During the 1930's, Rudy York of the
Detroit Tigers set a major league record with 18 home runs in a month. Does it
still stand?

It'll be 50 years old next month. York, a right-handed hitting catcher and third
baseman who later was a fixture at first base, belted 18 home runs in August
1937, and no slugger has ever had a better month. Willie Mays of the San
Francisco Giants came close with 17 in August 1965, and that stands as the
National League record. York hit only 17 other homers in 1937 for a total of 35.
Mays had 52 in 1965. When Babe Ruth hit 60 home runs for the Yankees in the 1927
season, the last 17 came in September, and that's the monthly record York
eclipsed, as well as the 60-year-old standard that still stands for left-handed
batters. QUESTION: In a tennis match, Player A returns Player B's serve with a
right-handed backhand shot, then switches the racquet to his left hand and
returns Player B's subsequent shot with a left-handed forehand? Is such a switch
permissible during the playing of a point?

There's nothing in the rule book forbidding it, and if a player should win a
point by going from hand to hand more than once, then he could expect a hand
from the crowd as well. Boris Becker earned one during his first-round victory
at Wimbledon two weeks ago. In a match against Karel Novacek of Czechoslovakia,
the West German star switched the racquet from his right hand to hit a
left-handed half-volley winner in the second set.

The only requirement in tennis is that one or both hands be holding the racquet
when it strikes the ball. This is true in squash racquets, too, where
switch-hitters are even scarcer than in tennis because the ball is upon the
players so quickly that there is little time to change one's mind, let alone
change racquet hands. QUESTION: How many games did Jim Kaat win in his career
and did he ever win the Cy Young Award?

In a career that established a major league record for longevity by a pitcher -
25 years from 1959-83 -Kaat won 283 games, lost 237 and is ranked 23d among
baseball's top-winning pitchers. But he never received a Cy Young Award as the
outstanding pitcher in his league even though he was just that in the American
League in 1966. Kaat pitched 305 innings and had a 25-13 record for the
Minnesota Twins that season with an earned run average of 2.74. But another
left-hander, Sandy Koufax of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League, won
27 games and earned by unanimous vote his third Cy Young Award in four years at
a time when baseball was giving out only one award for both leagues. The
following season, each league decided to honor its best pitcher, but Kaat, a
20-game winner with the Chicago White Sox in 1974 and 1975, never again came
close to getting a Cy Young.

Kaat, who came up with the original Washington Senators, then moved with them to
Minnesota, also pitched for the Philadelphia Phillies, the Yankees and the St.
Louis Cardinals, with whom he ended his career exactly four years ago at 44
years of age. QUESTION: Danny Sullivan has established himself as one of the top
CART Indy car drivers over the last three years after many years of driving in
other types of auto racing. How did he do as a Formula One driver?

Sullivan, a former New York City cab driver, did not fare too badly on the grand
prix circuit in 1983, the only year he competed, considering that his team's car
was not really competitive with the turbocharged engines of his rivals. As the
No. 2 driver for the Bennetton-Tyrell team, behind Michele Alboreto of Italy,
Sullivan's team's best finish was fifth in the Monaco Grand Prix. His 17th place
in the world drivers' standing that year was tops among rookies. QUESTION: In an
answer last month pointing out that the pro basketball and World Series
champions have never been from the same city in the same calendar year, wasn't
Baltimore incorrectly included as a city that won one title but not the other in
1971?

No question about it: the Bullets were swept in four games of the National
Basketball Association championship series by the Milwaukee Bucks in the spring
and the Orioles were World Series losers in seven games to the Pittsburgh
Pirates in the fall, so Baltimore missed out on both titles. The city was not
shut out of a sports championship that calendar year, though, for the Colts won
the 1971 Super Bowl from the Dallas Cowboys months before the Bullets and
Orioles made it to their championship series.

YOUNG RUSSIANS ON RISE AT BOROUGH TENNIS CLUB

BYLINE: BY VERONIKA BELENKAYA DAILY NEWS WRITER

SECTION: SUBURBAN; Pg. 11

LENGTH: 476 words


ANNA KOURNIKOVA got her tennis start in Moscow. Maria Sharapova went pro in
Florida. But the next breeding ground for future Russian tennis sensations could
be southern Brooklyn.

"These kids are extremely hardworking and are very goal-oriented from a young
age," said coach Noumroud Moukhapasov, 30. He travels around Brooklyn and Long
Island working with a number of young Russian-American would-be tennis prodigies
enrolled in the Stars Only tennis program.

"They are sacrificing time with friends and are spending at least three hours a
day on the courts," noted Moukhapasov.

For 13-year-old Gail Brodsky, the long hours on the court is time well spent.

"Tennis is my life, and I don't know how I could ever live without it," said
Gail, who practices under the watchful eye of her father and coach, Eduard. She
regularly plays at the Brooklyn Racquet Club in Sheepshead Bay and other courts
around the borough.

"If missing out on your childhood means traveling all over the world, then what
is your childhood?" she asked.

"I want to play the Grand Slams one day, and I want to play all the pro
tournaments - that's my dream."

The teen recently placed third in the U.S. Supernationals in the 14-and-under
category.

Gail said Sharapova and Kournikova "are both great tennis players, and a lot of
Russians are playing tennis because of them. I hope that one day, I can do the
same for tennis."

For 30 years, the Brooklyn Racquet Club has provided indoor courts and Russian
coaches to tennis pros such as U.S. Open doubles champ Max Mirnyi. He competed
in the Summer Olympics in Athens for his native Belarus, and is teamed with
Sharapova in the mixed-doubles competition at this year's Open.

Another youthful racquet club player is Andre Vorobyov, 13, who is ranked first
in the East in the boys' 14-and-under category.

"I want to be number one in the country someday," said Andre, who lives in
Midwood.

But the road to tennis stardom is not cheap. Indoor court rates in the fall and
winter average $40 an hour, and coaching fees are added to that.

"We have to play indoors for seven months, and it's hard for parents to afford
every day for three hours," said Brooklyn Racquet Club head coach Alex
Demidenko.

As a result, many local Russian-American youths ultimately forgo their dreams of
playing professionally and instead use their tennis talent to help finance a
college education.

"They play in Eastern and national tournaments and get tennis scholarships to
top schools because of it," said Demidenko, 42, who moved to Brooklyn from Minsk
- where he was a tennis pro - 11 years ago.

Still, tennis dad Eduard Brodsky took a gamble and moved with his daughter to
California, where Gail has a full scholarship to the Mark Weil Tennis Academy.

"We did what we had to do for Gail," Brodsky said. "My wife is still working in
Brooklyn, and we're in California, playing tennis."

CID busts another child trafficking racket in West Bengal, books school
principal

BYLINE: India Blooms News Service

LENGTH: 478  words


Kolkata/Jalpaiguri, Feb 20 (IBNS): After unearthing a north-Bengal based
international child trafficking racket and nabbing two women involved in it,
West Bengal Criminal Investigation Department (CID) has strengthened its probe
into the root of the racket, officials said.

Acting on a tip off, a team of CID has detained a primary schools head teacher
Chandana Chakraborty, who was also the chairperson of an NGO- North Bengal
Peoples Development Centre, earlier on Saturday and conducted raids at few
locations in Jalpaiguri district of West Bengal along with her, according to
reports. We were receiving complaints of child trafficking against two childrens
home- Ashray and Bimala Sishugriha, which were run by Chandana Chakraborty led
NGO- North Bengal Peoples Development Centre, a senior official of WB CID told
IBNS. We have arrested Chandana Chakraborty, who is also the head teacher of
Mainaguri Ananda Nagar Nimna Buniyadi Primary School, in connection with the
case and seized several important documents relating to child trafficking from
her possession, the official said. Later on Sunday, Bimala Sishugriha (Childrens
home)s Chief Adoptional Officer Sonali Mondal, who was reportedly associated
with the organization since last 20 years, was also arrested for her alleged
involvement with the racket. After recovering few documents from Sonali Mondals
possession, investigators confirmed that the child trafficking racket had
international links and they sold babies to several countries, including
Australia, Singapore, USA and UK. After going through the documents, which have
been seized so far, we have come to know that at least 17 children, aged between
3 months to 10 years, were peddled to other states of India and foreign
countries like Australia, USA, France and Singapore, an investigator told IBNS.
The NGO used to target virgin mothers and bought newborns from them. Later those
babies were sold to childless couples from other states or countries in the name
of adoption with false documents, the officer further said. Meanwhile, the CID
has lodged an FIR in the case naming at least 19 persons, including BJPs women
wing leader Juhi Chowdhury, involved in the case. However, the two arrested-
Chandana Chakraborty and Sonali Mondal- were produced in a local court on Sunday
and were sent to the state probe agencys custody for 13 days. We are currently
interrogating the duo to unearth the rackets root and catch others involved with
the child trafficking racket, a CID official said. Months ago, Bengal CID busted
another child trafficking racket, which reportedly peddled more than 50 babies
through an NGO in last two years, in West Bengals North 24 Parganas district and
besides nabbing 18 persons in connection with the case, investigators rescued at
least 32 newborn and toddlers from traffickers custody. (Reporting by Deepayan

Innisbrook set for the playoffs

BYLINE: NANCY MORGAN

SECTION: PASCO TIMES; Pg. 4

LENGTH: 623 words


The USA Tennis Adult League local playoffs are under way for men's and women's
teams. And, as often is the case, Pasco players are among the challengers.

Saturday morning, Pasco competitors play for the women's 3.5 Heron champions
Westin Innisbrook Resort and host the fall league winner Renaissance Vinoy.
Feather Sound Country Club plays at McMullen in Clearwater.

"Everybody did their share to get us where we are," said Innisbrook's first-year
captain Dale Slive of New Port Richey. "Every match we won was with a 3-2 score,
so we really squeaked it out each week."

Slive defended one of the two singles positions throughout the season and relied
on co-captain Sue Luidens, Susan Bucci, Lynn Goldman and Judy Warner to fill the
other. Since Slive had not played the weekly league circuit for several years
due to running a retail store in Pasco, she was not as familiar with other
clubs' players or those who played regularly at Innisbrook.

"The way I decided on the lineup was not to scout the other teams or look up
scores from other matches, but instead I just put out the best players we had
available for the matches. It's worked alright so far," Slive said.

Innisbrook boasts 15 players and Slive scheduled each of them to play at least
twice in the regular season. A 7-1 record attests to the strength of the team.
Rounding out the squad are Bonny Boosales, Phyllis Gary, Kay Fitzpatrick, Shirl
Ahrens, Anne Hammond, Josie Doucette, Joan Holland, Maureen Sternberg, Nancy
Kraemer and Debra McGinley.

Also entering women's playoffs are the Racquet Club vs. Royal Racquet Club and
Feather Sound against the Vinoy in 4.0. Among the men, East Lake beat Royal
Racquet Club 3-2, and the Racquet Club defeated Treasure Bay 3-2 in the first
round of 3.5 playoffs. Saturday, Treasure Bay travels to East Lake and Royal
Racquet Club is at the Racquet Club.

Winners already declared among the women are St. Petersburg Country Club in the
2.5, Countryside Country Club the 3.0 and Treasure Bay the 4.5. In men's
competition, McMullen won the 3.0, Seminole Lake Tennis Center the 4.0 and
Treasure Bay the 4.5.

SENIORS AT STATE: Last weekend, local league champions in the 4.0 and 4.5
divisions competed for state championships at the Florida Tennis Center in
Daytona Beach. In the men's 4.5, McMullen of Clearwater placed second to Orlando
among seven teams. Seminole Lake Tennis Center won its flight to advance to the
men's 4.0 semis. A 2-1 loss to Orange Park eliminated Seminole. In women's 4.0,
the St. Petersburg Tennis Center finished third in its flight. State champions
included the Orange Park men in 4.0, Orlando men in 4.5, Hunter's Green women's
4.0 and Winter Park women's 4.5.

NET SHOTS: Second-seeded Joel Samaha played through the boys 14-and-under
singles competition to win last month's state designated tournament. Istvan
Bolgar was fourth in the boys 16 division and Emily Dvorak was a girls 12
consolation finalist. Paul Polarczyk of Wesley Chapel defended his top seeding
to win the boys 14-and-under singles title in last weekend's Phil Green Tennis
Academy Summer Classic in Safety Harbor, as did Spring Hill's Jeanette McDonald
in the girls 16. No. 3 John McDonald reached the boys 16 final. Consolation
winners included Gina Schifano in the girls 16, Tara Turner 18 and Michael Wong
boys 16.

THIS WEEKEND: The Florida State Closed Mixed Doubles Championships begin
Saturday at Royal Racquet Club in Clearwater. Age divisions include open, 35 and
over, 45 and 55. Call Donna Coddington at (727) 799-3200. The SPTC Junior Open
is Saturday-Monday at the St. Petersburg Tennis Center. Singles with
consolations are planned for boys and girls 18 and under. Call Al Sarmiento,

NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: BRIGHTON BEACH;
Brighton Beach Memories, Sold!

BYLINE: By LENA WILLIAMS

SECTION: Section 14; Page 10; Column 3; The City Weekly Desk

LENGTH: 513 words


Bits and pieces of a bygone era were sold to the highest bidders last month,
when furnishings and memorabilia from the Brighton Beach Bath and Racquet Club
were auctioned off, including the Adirondack chairs where people including Mayor
John V. Lindsay and Tallulah Bankhead sunbathed by the sea.

Also sold at the Oct. 26 public auction at the club was the playground equipment
Neil Sedaka romped on as a child. The multicolored umbrellas, kitchen utensils
and card tables went too, along with signs like the one reading: "Sitting and
Smiling, Yes. Card-Playing, No."

The historic club, which was built in 1907, officially closed after the auction.
Now neighborhood residents are wondering what will become of the 15-acre
beachfront property at 3205 Coney Island Avenue.

For 13 years, residents have fought a proposal by Alexander Muss & Sons, a
Brooklyn development company that owns the property, to replace the private
club, which was known as "the subway Riviera," with a condominium complex
containing as many as 2,200 units.

Alexander Muss & Sons, which bought the club in 1955, is still listed as
principal owner in the most recent property records on file for Kings County,
which are dated March 1. Company officials did not return calls seeking comment,
but a woman who answered the phone at the Muss & Sons office said the company
had recently sold the property.

Irwin Fruchtman, a member of the Committee to Preserve Brighton Beach and
Manhattan Beach, a group opposed to the condominium project, said members had
recently met with the new owner, who he said was Joshua Muss, a developer and
nephew of the late Alexander Muss. Joshua Muss could not be reached for comment.

"The plans are to build a scaled-down 1,400-unit complex," said Mr. Fruchtman, a
former New York City Buildings Commissioner. "We will still press for public
review of any renewed land use proposals. We're also fighting to preserve
certain parts of the baths, like the carousel, which has Federal designation as
a historic landmark."

With its three swimming pools, 14 handball courts, three tennis courts, 22
paddle tennis courts, carousel, bandshell and wooden lockers, the club was a
summertime haven and a favorite of politicians.

During the 1960's, it had more than 10,000 members. At the end, nearly 2,000 men
and women in their 50's, 60's and 70's were paying $1,100 a year to share
steambaths with familiar faces.

"I began going to the club when I was a senior at Lincoln High School," recalled
one member, Madeline Weisenfeld, 76. "I fell in love with it. I took the trolley
car or my dad would drive me."

Like other members, Mrs. Weisenfeld is searching for a new retreat. She said 200
Brighton Beach club members had joined the Sea Gate Beach Club in a gated
community near Sea Gate, on the western end of the Cony Island peninsula. Others
are going to another club, Silver Gull, in the Breezy Point area of the
Rockaways.

But as Mrs. Weisenfeld said, it won't be the same. "I'm not going to see people
I've known for 40, 50 years," she said.   LENA WILLIAMS

Tennis rate racket

SECTION: DAKOTA WIRE; Pg. 1B

LENGTH: 503 words


Proposed indoor tennis rate increases stirred quite a racket this past week with
the Bismarck Park Board.

Some 20 enthusiasts gathered at the Sept. 17 meeting to protest the new playing
costs at Capital Racquet and Fitness Center.

Park board member Brian Beattie will meet with management at Capital Racquet and
players in the coming weeks to draft a compromise.

Among proposed rates questioned were raising:

* One-hour singles rates from $9 to $12 for non-members.

* 1.5 hours from $13.50 to $18 for non-member singles.

* Two-hour single play from $18 to $24.

* One hour of doubles play from $4.50 to $6.

* 1.5 hours of doubles play from $6.75 to $9 for non-members.

* Two hours of doubles from $9 to $12 for non-members.

Increases were considered for Gold member package rates for youth 12 and under,
students 13 to 17, adults 18 and older, and seniors.

Silver member package rates for families could be increased from $65 to $75 per
month.

A new $8 fee to enter the facility also is disputed by tennis players.

Board members said the new policy also ensures substitutes are paying when they
play. Board president Paul Quist said they had a situation where some
substitutes were paying on another person's membership. "They weren't paying the
entry fees or the court fees." He said some membership packages didn't require
members to pay court fees and subs were playing for free with the members' time.

"I think CRFC should charge an entry fee for people who come to work out or play
racquetball, and $8 seems reasonable," said J.D. Stephenson, a tennis player. "I
think charging an entry fee plus tennis court fees is ridiculous."

League fees have been added for those already paying for a package to use the
facility.

Some players say the proposed rates makes the game too expensive and they will
be playing less. Others worried it could hurt Bismarck's youth tennis programs.

Beattie will report on a new proposal Oct. 8.

Park district finance director Augie Ternes said it has been several years since
fees were increased. Board members said more gradual increases over the years
might be easier to accept. "This was a large increase," Quist said.

The rate fees proposed Sept. 17 can be viewed at the Bismarck Parks and
Recreation Office at 400 E. Front Ave. These are subject to change.

RACQUETS PROBLEM FOR PROS

BYLINE: By NEIL AMDUR

SECTION: Section C; Page 7, Column 1; Sports Desk

LENGTH: 647 words


Racquet switching may help some tennis players improve their strokes, but Larry
Stefanki and Van Winitsky say they have learned their lessons.

''I will never switch racquets again, no matter how attractive it seems,'' the
25-year-old Stefanki said yesterday, after having won his opening-round match
from Ramesh Krishnan, 6-7, 6-0, 6-4, in the Mercedes Tournament of Champions at
Forest Hills.

Last fall, after having lost in the second round of the United States Open,
Stefanki agreed to switch from an oversized to a midsized model. The switch
seemed logical at the time, he said, because he had used a regulation-size
wooden racquet of the same make in college, and he was ranked high enough to
receive an endorsement contract.

''I did it for financial reasons,'' Stefanki said, echoing a comment often heard
from pros in search of additional finances. ''At the time, I was ranked between
120 and 110 on the computer. But after the switch, I had 10 first-round losses
in a row, my elbow hurt, my ranking dropped to about 250 and I lost all my
confidence. Before I knew it, I wasn't getting into any tournaments, so there
was no money coming in at all. It was a nightmare.''

A Victory in Nigeria

Stefanki said he switched back again even before his endorsement contract was
formally signed. Within a month, he won a $25,000 tournament in Ogun, Nigeria,
that earned him a qualifying spot in this $500,000 event.

Winitsky said his racquet soul-searching began when he also switched from an
oversized to a mid-sized, believing that the switch would help him move from the
top 40 to the top 30. ''You find yourself getting to a certain position and feel
you're not getting high enough,'' he said after a 6-3, 6-4 victory over John
Fitzgerald, ''and you feel it's your racquet.''

Winitsky played despite being under a five-week suspension by the Men's
International Professional Tennis Council, which governs the Grand Prix. He was
involved in an incident with spectators during a non-Grand Prix event in
Antigua. But he was eligible to play here since the tournament, operated by
World Championship Tennis, is not under the council's jurisdiction.

Craig Wittus of Bloomfield Hills, Mich., and Brad Gilbert of Piedmont, Calif.,
also advanced with straight-set victories. Wittus, who also had qualified by
winning a tournament in Nigeria, beat Rocky Royer of Houston, 6-0, 6-4. Gilbert
had too much clay-court consistency for Nduka Odizor of Nigeria, 6-2, 6-2.

Bauer Is Defeated

But another promising Californian, Mike Bauer, was beaten by Peter Bastiansen of
Denmark, 5-7, 6-2, 6-0.

The program at the West Side Tennis Club seemed more like a preliminary than the
start of a W.C.T. event. The most familiar name on the six-match singles
schedule, Victor Pecci of Paraguay, failed to appear for his match with Michiel
Schapers of the Netherlands, and many spectators seemed almost as curious about
Guillermo Vilas, Henri Leconte and Jose-Luis Clerc, who were practicing on field
courts, as the activity in the stadium.

Stefanki's racquet situation is occurring with increased frequency on the
circuit as manufacturers seek to enhance their sales in a highly competitive
market by signing ranking pros. Last week John McEnroe, concerned about a
shoulder injury that was affecting his serve-and-volley game, tried a mid-sized
Dunlop graphite in Dallas, after having played for years with a regulation-size
wooden model.

Stefanki and Wittus went to Nigeria last February to improve their rankings.
''Not many people go to Nigeria,'' said Wittus, who faces fifth-seeded Vitas
Gerulaitis in the second round. ''But I was hard up for points.''

NEWS FOR KIDS PLAY FOR FREE

BYLINE: -Todd Cline

SECTION: SPORTS; Section D; Page 3

LENGTH: 576 words


You don't have to join an expensive athletic or country club to play tennis. Two
of the best places to find a court are local parks or high schools. These courts
are generally open to the public - first come first serve. But don't hog the
court. When you have finished your game, allow others to play.

As the weather warms up, it's ime to hit the courts GETTING THE TENNIS RACKET

If you ever get tired of team sports, waiting for your turn to bat or shoot,
tennis might be for you. Tennis is a fun sport that you can play against one
person, in teams of two (doubles) or even by yourself by hitting against a wall.

It's also one of the few sports that boys and girls can play together. And
tennis provides good exercise and will improve your coordination.

But tennis is not an easy game.

So News for Kids asked tennis teacher Ty Fuller, who specializes in showing kids
how to play, for a lesson.

Here are Fuller's basic tips for the tennis beginner: START SLOWLY

You can't learn everything about the game overnight. Tennis looks easier than it
actually is. Just because you hit the ball doesn't mean you've hit it correctly.
It will take several lessons to learn how to hold your arm and hit the shots.

HIT SOFTLY

This isn't baseball. No trophies will be given for balls hit over the fence. Try
to hit as many one-handed shots as possible. This will keep you from becoming a
slugger.

DEVELOP CONTROL

You want to last longer, not hit harder than your opponent. Try to keep the ball
in play and your opponent moving.

BE PATIENT

Tennis is harder to learn than most team sports. To become good, you will have
to practice the same drills over and over again.

GETTING STARTED

Luckily, you don't have to dress like Andre Agassi to play tennis. But some
special equipment is required:

A racket: You shouldn't use a hand-me-down from mom or dad because it will be
too big. But don't worry, you don't need an expensive racket, either. Fuller
suggests you buy an oversize junior racket. It will give you a bigger area to
hit the ball. You can get a decent one for under $ 25 at Target, Kmart or Toys
"R" Us.

Rackets come in different sizes. Here's what Fuller recommends for kids:

>Ages 6-8 should use a 23-inch racket.

>Ages 9-11 should use a 25-inch racket.

>Ages 12 and older should use a racket 27 inches long.

Shoes: Fuller says just about any kind of sneakers are good for beginners,
except ones with black soles. They scuff the courts.

Balls: For beginners, tennis balls are tennis balls and the only thing you need
to do is keep an eye out for a good sale. Fuller suggests using old, worn out
tennis balls. They don't bounce as high, which makes them easier to hit and
control.

TWO GOOD DRILLS

Besides being able to hit the ball over the net, one of the big tricks to
mastering this game is developing good hand-eye coordination. Here are two
drills to practice with a friend :

1. To help your ground strokes, yell "bounce" when the ball bounces on your side
of the court and "hit" as you return it. This helps you concentrate on watching
the ball all the way to your racket.

2. A volley is when you hit the ball back before it hits the ground. Put one of
those Velcro gloves - they're called "Skatch" - over your racket. (You can get
them at a toy store.) Then use the Velcro "Skatch" balls with a friend and
practice catching them on the racket. This helps you learn to keep your eye on
the ball and to hit volleys softly.

Squash: Scots out to block Nicol defection

BYLINE: Pete Nichols

SECTION: Guardian Sport Pages, Pg. 31

LENGTH: 405 words


The Scottish Commonwealth Games Council looks certain to takes steps to block
the participation of Peter Nicol, the current world and Commonwealth champion,
in next yearps games in Manchester.

The Scot wants to change allegiance and play for England in Manchester after
becoming disillusioned with the lack of financial support in the land of his
birth.

"I was stunned when I heard and I could not actually believe it," said Louise
Martin, chairperson of the SCGC.

Nicol will hold a press conference tomorrow morning but confirmed his intentions
yesterday. "There is 100% truth in this; I have been in talks with the English
set-up regarding funding through to the end of my career," he said.

Provided the Squash Rackets Association, which runs the English game, supports
the application, Nicol will be eligible for lottery funding under the English
world-class performance programme.

"I have received no help in my eight or nine years as a professional. I need
more back-up to stay at No1 and improve as a player," he said.

Yet Nicol, who is at the top of his sport's earnings tree having been top-ranked
in the world for the past 21/2 years, will probably benefit little or not at all
from the income and expenses available through lottery funding. The
28-year-old's earnings from prize money, league participation and sponsorship
are almost certainly in six figures and may well rule him out for those
payments.

However, he would benefit from the back-up programme run by the SRA, which
includes training camps and medical help.

His move would almost certainly guarantee the English team three gold medals in
the games, as the squash programme includes not only singles and doubles but the
rarely played mixed doubles.

But for the SCGC his defection would be a huge blow. Nicol is a passionate Scot
and he was heavily involved in launching the Scottish Commonwealth team's
sponsorship programme only three months ago. But he has been at loggerheads with
the Scottish SRA for some time.

The SCGC cannot prevent Nicol playing for England in world or European
championships but, because he competed for Scotland in the 1998 Commonwealth
Games, it can stop him playing for another country in Manchester.

Martin said: "Whatever country he wants to represent, he's got to get support
from the Commonwealth Games Council and the SCGC. Personally I would be very
loth to agree to that."

Mahoney can thank Graf for title

BYLINE: NANCY MORGAN

Carolyn Mahoney's interest in tennis began when the Spring Hill resident  first
watched Steffi Graf on television.

Mahoney started playing in 1990, and despite ACL surgery in 1993, is  currently
playing several times a week.

"I was totally determined to play after my surgery even though I was told  not
to," said Mahoney. "My surgery went well, my physical therapy was good,  and I
was ready to play again."

Mahoney describes her style as an aggressive net player who likes to put
pressure on her opponents, believing that will produce errors.

"Tennis is a mental game or is like a chess game," said Mahoney. "I love
setting up points, checking out the angles and watching them fall into  place."

In a recently completed women's singles league in the Hudson area, Mahoney
finished first among eight players. She was tied in total points with Monika
Feller, but edged Feller in head-to-head competition.

"Monika and I have really good matches," said Mahoney. "We're very  competitive
with each other."

Gaenor Broffel was third in the league, followed by Robin Molby, Marie  Maguire,
Janet Napolitano, Lori Jorgensen and Margaret Groth.

WOMEN'S PLAYOFFS: East Lake Woodlands earned its second win and the Racquet
Club of St. Petersburg its first in the U.S. Tennis Association Adult League
3.5 women's playoffs last weekend. East Lake defeated Seminole Lake 3-2 and
faces the Vinoy Saturday. The Racquet Club beat the Vinoy 4-1 and will play
Seminole this weekend.

Paradise Island clinched the 4.0 division by edging East Lake 3-2, as it  did in
its first playoff match.

MEN'S PLAYOFFS: Innisbrook won its second match in the USTA Adult League  3.5
division with a 3-2 victory over East Lake and the Vinoy beat the Racquet  Club
4-1 for its second win. Saturday, Innisbrook hosts the Vinoy in the
division-determining match.

In the 4.0 division, Countryside and the St. Petersburg Tennis Center  scored
wins over East Lake and the Racquet Club respectively. Saturday, the
Countryside-SPTC matchup will determine the division winner.

Royal Racquet Club and the Racquet Club were winners in the 4.5 competition
last weekend. Saturday, Royal faces the Racquet Club and Safety Harbor plays
McMullen. If McMullen and Royal win, a three-way tie will occur among  McMullen,
Royal and the Racquet Club. Then a tiebreak will be used, counting  most
individual matches won or fewest sets or games lost in the playoff series  to
determine the winner.

In the Innisbrook win last week, singles players Jim Smith and Reinhard
Lauterbach scored two-set victories in the No. 1 and No. 2 positions
respectively. Conrad Berhorster and Willie Coquelet won 6-3, 6-3 in No. 3 to
give Innisbrook the team win over the Racquet Club. Bob McKenzie and Jerry
McDowell lost in straight sets in No. 1 and Joe Gari and Ed McGinley fell in
three sets in No. 3.

SCHOOLS BREAK: The USTA/Florida Section held its third of four summer  regional
meetings at Countryside Country Club in Clearwater last weekend.  Four-year
section staffer Bob Foster provided an orientation for new  volunteers, as well
as updated information and program materials for the USTA  Schools Program.

The Schools Program provides resources, assistance and training to schools  in
an effort to introduce tennis to students. The program began in the  mid-1980s
and Florida has a core of about 150 volunteers who assist the USTA  in its
effort.

Last weekend, nearly 20 volunteers from the surrounding area participated  in a
roundtable discussion and idea-sharing at Countryside. Pasco and Hernando
county volunteers included Judy Jeanette, Linda LeClaire, Marie Maguire,
Laverne Stephens, Jim Mead and Karen Turman.

What a racquet - size matters

SECTION: Pg. 32

LENGTH: 688  words


IT HAS not only been a desire to make tennis easier to play, that has encouraged
the development of the oversized tennis racquet in the past 30 years.

Originally restricted to wood and catgut, tennis racquet size was constrained by
the strength of the materials available.

As man-made products like steel, aluminium and more recently graphite for the
bodies and synthetic strings became available; makers could expand the size of
the racquet head.

But the recent changes in racquet design are merely a reflection of more than a
century of developments in a sport where the design of the racquet has been
fluid.

Back in 1874 when Major Walter Wingfield revolutionised the marketing of tennis
by packaging racquets, nets and posts, tennis racquets were lopsided in shape,
reflecting their origins in the game of real tennis, which has been around since
the 16th Century.

The blossoming of the sport also brought out a proliferation of racquet designs
over the decades as more materials became available and opened up new design
possibilities.

Until the early part of the 20th century racquets were largely made of solid
wood, with bare wooden handles. The head shape was either a flat-top or
tear-drop design.

By the 1930s and perhaps reflecting the increasing athleticism of the players,
racquet makers began experimenting with new technologies.

One was using wooden laminates to allow combinations of strength and flexibility
in different areas of the racquet. In the USA there was even some experiments
with metal heads and even strings attached to a wood- en handle, but these
designs had limited popularity.

Makers also began the wrap the bare wooden handles in leather grips - a design
that became standard for the next 40 years or more until synthetic materials
began to make an impact there as well.

In 1968 the emergence of the Wilson T2000, the first all-metal racquet, was the
beginning of the modern revolution in tennis.

Popularised by Jimmy Connors, the racquet was lighter and more flexible than
wooden models and more importantly its structural strength allowed for the
development of bigger head sizes. In the 1970s and 80s players were offered a
bewildering array of choices as more and more materials became available to
manufacturers.

Racquets increased in size, but became lighter. Stronger materials encouraged
players to string racquets tighter, increasing the amount of power and spin they
could impart to the ball.

Today most racket frames are made from light-weight graphite or graphite
composites that incorporate materials such as titanium, kevlar or fibreglass,
giving added levels of frame flexibility, while remaining cost effective.

Modern rackets are made in a variety of shapes and lengths.

In January 1997, the International Tennis Federation introduced manufacturing
guidelines covering design dimensions. While a modern 135 square inch (340cm2)
head on a 29 inch (73.5cm) long racket remains legal, it is still twice the head
size of the older wooden rackets.

This has allowed manufacturers to open up the world of tennis to a wider market.
"~Widebody' type rackets provide greater power and possess a larger sweet spot
than conventional rackets, making them more popular with recreational players -
despite being more difficult to control because of the more pronounced
"trampoline" effect of the ball on the strings.

The grip, handle and strings of racquets have also undergone many changes in
recent decades.

Leather grips are more or less obsolete now because of its unpredictable
friction resistance.

Today, synthetic fabrics are more widely used because they can be textured or
patterned on the surface to further improve friction. .

The shaft, connecting the racket head to the handle, is another important
feature.

A flexible shaft will absorb shock vibrations better, a firmer shaft will
deliver greater power by holding the head and hence strings correctly.

Whatever their choice, players are affected by the flex of the shaft as well as
that of the head, and the characteristics of that flex vary according to the
materials used.

Next week the column will look at the evolution in design of the golf club.

Question Box

BYLINE: By S. Lee Kanner

SECTION: Section C; Page 11, Column 3; Sports Desk

LENGTH: 720 words


QUESTION: Player A, in a tennis match, lunges to return the ball near the net.
He inadvertently throws his racquet, which strikes the ball and sends it over
the net. The racquet remains on his side of the net. Player B cannot return the
ball. Whose point is it?

Player A loses the point because he threw his racquet. If he had not thrown his
racquet, but touched the net with it as he lunged for the ball, he would also
lose the point.
QUESTION: What were the final 1981-82 statistics for Larry Bird and Julius
Erving?

Bird, in 77 games: 711 field goals in 1,414 attempts for an average of .503; 328
free throws in 380 attempts for .863; a total of 1,761 points for an average of
22.9 a game; 200 offensive rebounds, 637 defensive rebounds, 447 assists, 143
steals, 254 turnovers and 66 blocked shots.

Erving, in 81 games: 780 field goals in 1,428 attempts for .546; 411 free throws
in 539 attempts for .763; a total of 1,974 points for an average of 24.4 a game;
220 offensive rebounds, 337 defensive rebounds, 319 assists, 161 steals, 214
turnovers and 141 blocked shots.
QUESTION: Why is it necessary to subtract a player's home runs in figuring his
runs-produced total?

The formula for runs-produced is runs batted in, plus runs scored, minus home
runs. This is done to avoid having the homers count twice. Runs produced is not
an official statistic and is kept only by some clubs and by some reporters.
QUESTION: If the challenger's yacht wins the America's Cup race, is the next
race conducted in the winner's home waters or does the race always take place
off Newport, R.I.? Also, with the new rules changes, can the challengers use
American technology in 1983?

The yacht club that wins the America's Cup can elect to hold the match anywhere
in the world, provided the site is located on an arm of a sea giving access to
deep water. Before the rules changes, everything on a yacht had to be from the
country it represented. Now, because of the evolution of world-wide technology,
components and equipment such as sails, spars, sail-handling equipment and
towing tanks are available to both challengers and defenders from any country.
The hulls of the 12-Meter yachts, however, must be designed and built in the
countries they represent, and all members of the crews must be nationals of
those countries.
QUESTION: How long has Barry Jaeckel been on the PGA Tour? What are his career
earnings, his earnings in 1982, and has he won any tournaments?

Jaeckel, on tour since 1975, has one victory, in the 1978 Tallahassee Open.
Through the Buick Open that ended Aug. 22, his career earnings were $346,363,
including $48,694 in 1982. He was ranked 79th among the money winners for this
year.
QUESTION: A baseball game is being played in a stadium where the bullpens are
down the left-field and right-field sidelines. A catcher, warming up a relief
pitcher, lets a ball escape him. It rolls into fair territory as an outfielder,
chasing after a fly ball, trips over the ball on the ground and misses the one
in the air. What is the ruling?

The ball is in play; the batter advances as far as he can at his own risk.
QUESTION: From the professional football camps come reports of players being
cut, released or waived. What is the difference?

There is no difference between being released or cut, and when this happens to a
player he can, if possible, make a deal for himself with another team. Under the
waiver system, a club makes a player's contract available to other teams, who
can either file a claim to obtain the player or waive the chance to do so, and
this is where the term ''waiver'' comes in. The claiming period from July
through December is 24 hours, and no waiver can be withdrawn by a club. If a
player is unclaimed and is not recalled by his original team, he is a free
agent.

Hit by cramps, Raonic loses to qualifier Harrison at US Open

SECTION: SPORT; Pg. D2

LENGTH: 661 words


NEW YORK * The cramping became so debilitating, Milos Raonic said, he couldn't
grip his racket properly.

The Wimbledon runner-up just last month, and seeded No. 5 at the U.S. Open,
Raonic began to feel pain near his left wrist midway through the second set of
what would become a stunning 6-7 (4), 7-5, 7-5, 6-1 second-round loss to
120th-ranked American qualifier Ryan Harrison on Wednesday.

Eventually, the problem spread to Raonic's right forearm. Then both thighs. Then
his left hip flexor. Afterward, his back seized up when he tried to sling his
equipment bag over a shoulder. No way to try to win a tennis match. Or to serve:
That's normally his most effective stroke, yet he double-faulted 15 times.

"It was just catching me all over," Raonic said. "I started getting small
(cramps) where I couldn't hold the racket. I couldn't switch grips from one
point to the next. There were a few points where I would hold the racket with my
left and try to stretch out my right hand in between shots - and that's not
going to work."

He was one of a trio of highly seeded players to exit Flushing Meadows on Day 3,
although the other departures were less surprising.

No. 3 Garbine Muguruza, the French Open champion, made 38 unforced errors and
bowed out 7-5, 6-4 against Anastasija Sevastova at night. All four of Muguruza's
U.S. Open appearances have ended in the first or second round. No. 9 Svetlana
Kuznetsova, the 2004 champion, took the first four games before losing 6-4, 6-4
to Caroline Wozniacki, who is unseeded but can rely on the muscle memory from
two trips to the final in New York.

Later under the lights, 14-time major champion Rafael Nadal was to face Andreas
Seppi.

Raonic was a semifinalist at Wimbledon in 2014 and at the Australian Open this
January. Then, while briefly working with John McEnroe, he beat Roger Federer in
the semifinals at the All England Club in July to reach his first Grand Slam
final.

"I was my own worst enemy today," Raonic said. "I tried the best I could to find
my way out of it. My body didn't let me."

Harrison, meanwhile, finally has the sort of breakthrough victory predicted long
ago for him. He entered Wednesday with a 1-26 record for his career against
top-10 opponents

The 24-year-old, born in Louisiana and now based in Texas, earned his first trip
to the third round at a Grand Slam tournament. He had been 0-6 in second-round
matches.

Until Monday, Harrison hadn't won a main-draw match at any major in 3 1/2 years.

"It's mental maturity, a little bit of stabilization with everything around me
that is allowing me to play with a sense of calm and also with excitement," said
Harrison, who turned pro nearly a decade ago and reached a top ranking of 43rd
in 2012. "My personality is a very fiery one. I like to be really intense when
I'm competing, flirt with that line of getting so intense that it (was) taking
me away from what I was trying to accomplish."

Last week, Harrison and his sibling Christian, 22, became the first pair of
brothers to both qualify for the U.S. Open.

"How cool," the older Harrison said, "is it to have him with me at the Open?"

While Christian lost in the first round Tuesday, Ryan took pleasure in being
joined in the third round by a couple of other Americans: No. 20 John Isner beat
Steve Darcis 6-3, 6-4, 6-7 (10), 6-3, and No. 26 Jack Sock defeated Mischa
Zverev 6-1, 6-1, 6-2.

"Good thing for Ryan. He has been around for a while, but he's still very
young," Isner said. "Good thing he's figuring it out again."

Harrison certainly was helped by his opponent's problems on a muggy day with the
temperature in the mid-80s. But he also played quite cleanly after recovering
from a double-fault that ceded the opening set: Harrison finished with 33
unforced errors, one in the last set. Raonic's total was 62, 21 in the third set
alone.

"I didn't create this pressure for myself or this kind of stress on myself,"
Raonic acknowledged. "He did that." !@COPYRIGHT=© 2016 The Daily Gleaner

On the job

SECTION: MONEY; ON THE JOB; Pg. B7

LENGTH: 693 words


Marsha P. Hayward

Certified racquetball pro; director of programs

Wayside Racquet & Swim Club, Marlboro

Age: 60

Family: Single

Native of: Fort Fairfield, Maine, and grew up in Perth, New Brunswick, Canada.

Lives in: Hudson

Time in job: 19 years

What do you do?

"I teach people who have never played racquetball all the way to league and
tournament players. I coach, and I also manage all the racquetball programs at
the club."

What is racquetball?

"Racquetball is an indoor game in which a small ball is batted against a wall or
walls with a racquet. The racquet has a handle that's shorter than a tennis
racquet. Players alternate hitting the ball."

How did you get into this job?

"I had just moved to Hudson from Waltham in 1982. Then a cop friend introduced
me to racquetball. I fell in love with racquetball immediately. I never took
lessons, but I was always an athlete. After I played him twice, I was beating
him regularly. Then a year later, all my friends joined Wayside to play tennis,
so I did, too. I played tennis for a while, but one day I walked over to the
racquetball courts, and the rest is history. Deb Williams was the women's
racquetball coach at the time - she still lives in Upton. She said something
about me being a hot-shot tennis player, but only a B racquetball player. So, I
would play against her and she would give me tips. I wound up as her racquetball
partner for three years, and I wound up taking her job when she left the club to
raise her family. I went to Rhode Island and became AmPro (International
Professional Racquetball Organization) certified."

What did you do before you did this?

"I was an instructor of dental assisting at Boston University; I graduated seven
classes of dental assistants for BU. After that, I was the manager of the dental
department at Beth Israel Hospital."

What made you decide to change careers?

"I was 28 when my dad died (of a massive coronary). I didn't want to die young.
There was a lot of stress in my other jobs. His passing had a great deal to do
with this decision."

Who plays racquetball?

"Any one, any age, any level - racquetball is an inexpensive sport. Plus, the
stress relief and it's a great cardiovascular workout. The best part of
racquetball is meeting other people and making friends. It's not boring like
being on a treadmill for an hour."

What did you do when you first started at the club?

"I increased all the racquetball programs, leagues, lessons and junior classes
by 75 percent. We have four courts here and I began by filling all the courts.
It still remains that way today even though they say we're a dying sport - not
here!"

Do you enjoy teaching racquetball?

"I love teaching, and I love to play racquetball. One simple answer is that when
people come to me and say they want to learn to play the sport, I tell them that
when they walk onto the court and hit the ball - they will fall in love with the
game. I start kids at 5 if they're athletically inclined. John-Craig Chisholm is
19 now, and he is a nationally ranked junior player. He lives in Marlboro; I
probably taught him for 11 years. His sister, Courtney, is 16, and she is also a
nationally ranked junior champ. She was world champion in 2009."

Have you ever been nationally ranked?

"I was ranked second nationally in women's U.S. Racquetball Association Division
A in 1991."

Did you have a mentor?

"Fran Davis. She has been a national champion, the U.S. national coach and U.S.
Olympic coach. I've been to her camps. Everything I do and everything I've done
has to do with what she taught me."

What's the best part of your job?

"I don't walk onto the court - or either do any of these people who play here -
without being happy. Racquetball players are the best people ... look at them,
look at how happy they are - they don't look like they're going to the dentist."

Is there a worst part?

"Truthfully, seeing people get injured. Like when someone sprains an ankle.
Thankfully, that doesn't happen often."

Irreverent Barbara Grabs the Brass Ring

Bob Levey

SECTION: STYLE; Pg. C08; BOB LEVEY'S WASHINGTON

LENGTH: 793 words


She is a writer who specializes in the arts. But she says she likes "irreverent
pieces. I think irreverence is the greatest quality anyone can have."

It'll win you Levey's neologism contest, that's for sure. And for Barbara Rich,
of Charlottesville, it just did.

Barbara was one of about 3,000 wordsmiths who took a swing at the August version
of our monthly make-up-a-word contest. The challenge was:

That sharp ping that a tennis racket makes when it strikes a tennis ball is
called . . .

Barbara's winning answer:

Thwacket.

That's a neat merger of "thwack" and "racket" -- and the "racket" piece is a
nice pun. It's racket as in what you hit a tennis ball with, and racket as in
sound. Barbara's neologism hit my ear with a sharp ping, as winning neologisms
always do. Some months, I stew and stew before choosing a winner. This month, I
pounced.

It was a good thing that Barbara Rich did the same. The same entry was submitted
by eight other contestants (Lisa Harvey, former champ Ruth Ruskin, Michael Gips,
Jean Stewart, Roger Gilkeson, Edie Huffman, Nick Flokos and Adele Leff). But
Barbara's entry reached my desk first. Under our rules, that gives her the brass
ring.

Our winner is the theater critic for a Charlottesville newspaper. She has
published short stories in three magazines, and she says she likes to do
political interviews (they test -- and hone -- her irreverence, she reports).

Originally from a city in Maryland called "Ball-ee-more" (that's how she still
pronounces it), Barbara has lived and worked in Charlottesville for 33 years.

Congratulations to her for her victory, and for her persistence. Neither of us
could remember exactly how long Barbara has been entering these contests. But
this neologism derby has been around for nearly 18 years, and Barbara has been
entering since shortly after it began.

Barbara and I agreed to delay her victory lunch either until she's up here or
I'm down there. In the meantime, I can say to her without my mouth being full of
food: Irreverence forever, and well done.

These were the Almosts and Nearlies for the August contest:

Cracket (and similar forms): Donna Brand, Joyce Small, of Herndon, Albert P.
Toner, of Arlington, former champ Marlene B. Cohen, of Columbia, former champ
Scott Burroughs, of Wake Forest, N.C., and Raffi Melkonian, of Kingdom of Fife,
Scotland.

Whacket (and similar forms): June E. Dorothy, of Adelphi, former champ Jayne
Townend, Marilyn Goldhammer, Michael Forcinito, of Rockville, Alan D. Lichtman,
of North Bethesda, Wendy Jordan, Michael Gips again and Amy Small.

Tennistinnabulation (and similar forms): Jamey Lee West, of Gaithersburg, Debbie
Fulmer, of Bethlehem, Pa., Roberta Richardson, of Bethesda, and former champ Tom
Witte, of Gaithersburg.

Crushendo: Greg Dobbins, of Arlington.

Gut Reaction: Karen E. Holt, of Charlottesville, Va.

Ballop: Ron Pytel.

Ballzooka: John Held, of Fairfax.

Tenpany: Kathy White.

Thwackhand: Jon Argaman.

Rackochet: Gina Haldeman, of Alexandria.

Vollop: Dianne Konz, of Vienna, and Sam Mecum, of Lancaster, Pa.

Wimbletone: Ben Llewellyn, of Falls Church, first, then 13 more just like his.

Wimbledin: Hank Wallace, of Northwest Washington, Phil Frankenfeld, of Northwest
Washington, and Peter Rosenquist, of Winston-Salem, N.C.

Rackhit: Wendy Jordan again.

Racketearing: Tamara R. Slaughter, of Alexandria, and Eric Pargament.

And for dessert, a wince-inducer -- Billie Jean Ping: Bill Strider, of
Gaithersburg.

After that display, I won't ask, "Tennis, anyone?" You contestants don't need
exercise. You need more food for thought. So here goes with the September
challenge:

Once upon a time, the Lindy Hop was hot. So was the Hula-Hoop. So was the pet
rock. But we live in a world of quickly changing tastes, so all these products
and pastimes that were once so hot are now cold, dead history. These former
cultural kings are called . . .

First prize will not be your very own poodle skirt or a pair of khakis with a
buckle in the back. But the winner does get a free lunch, at a restaurant of his
or her choice, in Washington or close enough not to annoy the Big Bosses.

Contest rules: You may enter as often as you like, on one piece of paper or
several. Joint entries are welcome. So are entries submitted by fax
(202-334-5150) or e-mail (leveybwashpost.com). Entries must bear day and evening
phone numbers, including area code(s). All entries become my property. Entries
will not be accepted by phone or returned. In case of duplicate winning entries,
I'll choose the one I receive first.

Please mail entries to Bob Levey, The Washington Post, Washington, D.C. 20071.
Entries for the September contest must be received by Sept. 30.

Snowbird sells its racquet, fitness club

BYLINE: By Paul Beebe The Salt Lake Tribune

SECTION: BUSINESS

LENGTH: 427 words


Snowbird Corp. has sold the Snowbird Canyon Racquet & Fitness Club at the mouth
of Big Cottonwood Canyon to a company owned by Salt Lake City businessman and
philanthropist Kevin Gates. The price wasn't disclosed.

Snowbird sold the club to Wasatch Gates LLC because of financial pressures
brought on by the growth of taxpayer-supported fitness centers in Salt Lake
County, Snowbird President Bob Bonar said.

"The racquet club over the years at times has been operationally profitable.
But, as you've seen, over the years additional facilities have been built in the
vicinity.

"Specifically, you've seen additional competition from the county. Their
beautiful tax-subsidized facilities have made it more difficult in the recent
past to operate on a solid financial basis."

Jim Braden, press secretary for Salt Lake County Mayor Peter Corroon, declined
to comment.

"We're happy, if he's happy, if he sold it for the right price," Braden said.

Salt Lake County owns 13 fitness centers. The closest to the Snowbird club is
the Dimple Dell Fitness and Recreation Center in Sandy, eight miles away.

The closest taxpayer-supported competitor is the Cottonwood Heights Recreation
Center, a mile west. It's owned by residents of the Cottonwood Heights Parks and
Recreation Service Area.

Gates has not decided what he will do with the 11-acre, 106,000-square-foot
tennis, swimming and fitness club, said Robert Taylor, Gates' attorney.

"We don't know. We're studying the options. It's probably only limited by one's
imagination at this point," Taylor said.

In a statement, Gates said, "We look forward to establishing first-class
facilities that the people of Cottonwood Heights will be proud to have as part
of their community."

The site at 7350 S. Wasatch Blvd. is "a remarkable property," said Gates, chief
executive officer of New Freedom Mortgage Corp. and founder of the Marshall
Gates Foundation, which promotes amateur sports. The foundation donated money
for the construction of Gates Field, a $2.5 million baseball field at Kearns
High School in Kearns.

The Snowbird club has about 750 fitness and tennis members. The company will
operate the club through September. Its Snowbird Sports Education Foundation,
human resources and central reservations offices will remain at the site through
July 2007.

"While it's not easy to sell a wonderful facility that many families have
enjoyed for years, we feel that the buyer and its principals make a very good
fit for the community of Cottonwood Heights," Bonar said.

Snowbird bought the club in 1990. It opened in 1974.

Kiefer's flying racquet has Frenchman fuming

BYLINE: DAVID REED

SECTION: SPORT; Pg. 48

LENGTH: 803  words


MELBOURNE

A European stoush broke out at the Australian Open yesterday after German
Nicolas Kiefer threw his racquet across the net in an apparent attempt to
distract French opponent Sebastien Grosjean during a spiteful quarterfinal.

Kiefer prevailed in a gut-wrenching 96-minute final set to win 6-3 0-6 6-4 6-7
(1-7) 8-6 but Grosjean was seething after the match.

"I didn't know you are allowed to throw your racquet when you play," Grosjean
said. "If a ball drops from my pocket, or even the hat, we replay the point. But
it didn't happen like that."

The score was 6-5 in the fifth set when Kiefer threw his racquet as Grosjean
moved for a high volley. The Frenchman missed the volley and lost the point but
was so incensed he called for tournament supervisor Mike Morrissey to make a
ruling on whether Kiefer was guilty of hindrance. But Morrissey accepted central
umpire Carlos Bernades' view that Kiefer's racquet toss had not affected
Grosjean's shot.

The rules of the game state: "If a player is hindered in playing the point by a
deliberate act of the opponent(s), the player shall win the point."

On those grounds, Grosjean should have been awarded the point.

But replays of the incident were inconclusive on whether Grosjean saw the
racquet before he failed to make his shot. And uncertainty from Bernades on
whether Kiefer meant to throw his racquet could have made the umpire reluctant
to award the point to Grosjean. But the Frenchman had no doubt as to what should
have happened. "I think I deserved a let and we replay the point, that's the
minimum. And maybe he has to give me the point because he's not allowed to throw
his racquet if the point is not over," he said.

Kiefer said he had apologised to Grosjean and that the pair were good friends
but the Frenchman told a different tale in his press conference, saying he never
heard any apology, adding: "I mean 'friend' is a big word, I think. No, I think
I was a little bit disappointed in the way he threw the racquet on such a big
point ... that's not the way."

Kiefer defended himself against charges of poor sportsmanship, saying he was a
tense person who was "cooking" on the inside.

"Everybody has to understand, there are so many emotions and so much tension,"
he said. "You fight for four and a half hours and it happens. I thought ... I
had lost this point, then all of a sudden after he missed, the racquet went
over.

"Of course, it's not nice, but what can I do? I'm a person with so much tension.
I was surprised that I got this point, but I took it. We shouldn't talk only
about this, there were so many close calls, especially in the tie break. I mean,
(the) first point, it's clearly out, (the umpire's) not overruling it."

Kiefer must now focus his attention on more pressing matters - how to beat world
No.1 Roger Federer in their semifinal.

Falling equipment sales reflect tennis' woes

BYLINE: Doug Smith

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 12C

LENGTH: 314 words


A sizable two-year dip in racket sales - from $ 170 million in June 1992, to $
107.4 million in June 1994 - signaled a drooping interest in tennis.

It was among the factors cited in Sports Illustrated's "Tennis Is Dying" story
published in May 1994.

Brad Patterson of the Tennis Industry Association agrees the sport has lost some
luster, but doesn't believe reduced racket sales should be cited as an indicator
of decline.

"In recent years, rackets have been made so well, people who bought them haven't
really needed another one," Patterson said.

A drop of 7%-8% in ball sales and a substantial reduction in recreational
players - 35 million in 1978 to 22 million in 1994 - more accurately signal the
game's fading appeal, Patterson says.

"There are just so many more things people can do today then they could do 20
years ago," he said. "Then there were no video games, no Blockbuster Video, no
beach volleyball, no skateboarding and MTV. We haven't kept up with the times."

Sports researcher Bill Lawliss says, "We're losing tennis players to other
activities at both ends of the age spectrum. Older people are switching to golf
and young people . . . don't feel tennis is as cool as it used to be."

Rick Margin of Prince attributes poor marketing at the pro level as another
reason for the public's disinterest.

"The pros have not done a good job of pushing the image of tennis so that people
other than tennis people get to know who the players are," Margin said. "Crowds
are not looking for grumpy, overpaid kids."

Margin also believes changes in tennis rules ought to be considered.

"Basketball put in a three-point rule, and football is constantly tinkering with
its rules," Margin said. "The rules of tennis are in dire need of review. Not
being open-minded about changing the rules sends a message that the sport is
arrogant, stodgy and traditional."

Cash: Wooden racket won't hinder Borg's bid

BYLINE: Chris Martin

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 2C

LENGTH: 157 words


Using an outdated wooden racket won't hamper Bjorn Borg's comeback plans,
according to Pat Cash.

The former Wimbledon champion has been helping Borg, who retired in the early
1980s after winning 11 grand slam titles, sharpen his game for his comeback at
the Monte Carlo Open April 22-28.

Cash and Borg practiced two hours a day in London until Cash left this week to
play the $ 1 million Suntory Japan Open.

''There has been a lot of talk about Borg's racket. But I tried it out and it is
actually quite powerful,'' said Cash.

''There is no point in him using a more powerful modern racket if he can't
control the ball with it. If all a new racket does is help him hit the ball
harder, but into the bottom of the net, it is not much use. He is hitting the
ball very hard and making some incredible shots,'' said Cash. ''Obviously, he is
not at his best, yet, but give him six months or so and then we will really be
able to see.''

To get ahead in the tennis racket, you'll want to learn all the angles

BYLINE: By Rod Carlylegwinnett/county; sports; tennis

SECTION: EXTRA; Section J; Page 9

LENGTH: 459 words


Many of us did not enjoy studying angles while in school, but there are three
shots we often have to hit that require understanding of one phrase we should
have learned, but may have forgotten.

"The angle of incidence equals the angle of return" is easy to understand if you
think of how pool balls come off the rails of the pool table. If the ball is hit
into the rail at a 45-degree angle, it will rebound off at a 45-degree angle.

On overheads, half-volleys, and when changing the direction of a ball when
returning a shot, knowing what this phrase means is vital.

When hitting an overhead, the ball is coming into your racket on a downward
angle. If your racket meets the ball square, the ball will angle down, usually
ending in the net. This is why your pro will instruct you to swing up when
hitting this shot. This will counteract the downward angle of the ball, enabling
you to successfully execute a well-hit smash.

When striking a half-volley, the opposite situation exists. At impact, the ball
is actually rebounding off the court upward. Most people flip the racket up when
trying to execute this stroke, usually popping the ball up and hitting the ball
long or giving the opponent an easy floater. Since the ball is angling upward
already, you have to counteract this by swinging level, and in some cases you
have to slightly close the racket face.

This enables you to hit a crisp, low ball back to the opponent. This sounds like
you will hit these low balls into the bottom of the net, but practice the flat
or closed racket face and you will find that you now will execute this shot just
like the pros.

The third instance when you need to remember the phrase is when you are in a
rally and wonder which direction to hit the return.

Most pros advise against changing the direction of incoming shots. For instance,
if your opponent hits a cross-court shot, you should return it cross-court.

It is, of course, often a good idea to change direction, such as when the entire
opposite side of the court is wide open. When you do decide to change direction,
remember our phrase of the day.

Since the ball is coming at one angle and you have decided to change the return
angle, you need to give yourself a lot of room for margin of error. So if you
are taking a cross-court shot and attempting to hit down the line, aim three
feet inside the line. This should give enough margin for error, and thus keep
you from hitting your shot wide.

Most may never use what was supposed to be memorized in geometry, but every once
in a while, something does come in handy.

Nine Yanks and a Jerk came home with a hole in it. 'What happened, Captain
Stewart?'

BYLINE: Pioneer Press

SECTION: BULLETIN BOARD

LENGTH: 1268 words


Writes Rocky of White Bear Lake: "My husband grew up in a family of four boys,
all of whom joined the military. One brother was in the Navy, two others in the
Army, and 'Rackets' joined the Air Force in December 1942.

"After going through basic training in Miami Beach, he proceeded to Armament
(weapons, explosives and heavy bomber) School in Denver. After graduation in
June 1943, 'Rackets' was assigned to the 703rd Bomb Squadron, 445th Bomb Group
at the Sioux City Air Base in Iowa, where the group took overseas training.

"While in Sioux City, a new operations officer was assigned to the squadron,
whom the men soon found out was Captain Jimmy Stewart. After two weeks, Captain
Stewart was made their squadron commander, and in October 1943, the entire 445th
Bomb Group was put on overseas alert. They then proceeded to Camp Shanks, New
York, where they eventually boarded the Queen Mary on October 31st with nine
other bomb groups, for a total of 27,000 men destined for England. They landed
on November 3, at Firth of Clyde, Scotland. From there they proceeded to
Tibenham Airbase (south of Norwich, and one of hundreds of airbases throughout
England during WW II), where 'Rackets' was stationed for 19 months with the 8th
Air Force.

"Assigned as Armorer on Ten Yanks and a Jerk, the plane Capt. Jimmy Stewart
piloted, 'Rackets' has many stories to tell of those memorable times. As lead
pilot, Capt. Jimmy Stewart flew many missions, and was admired and respected by
all the men he commanded. One mission in particular, however, really stood out.
Forty B-24s were readied and took off headed for France, to ultimately bomb a
railroad, thereby thwarting its use by the Germans. Of the 40 planes sent out,
heavy casualties ensued, and only 13 returned. One of the last planes coming
back in was Nine Yanks and a Jerk. No one initially got out, and there was a
huge hole in the plane behind the pilot's seat. The radio operator was killed
during the mission, and another crew member injured.

" 'Rackets' ran up to the plane and said to Capt. Stewart: 'Are you all right,
sir?'

"Jimmy Stewart said: 'Corporal, we got the s*** kicked out of us today!' "

Was it over when the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor?

Greenman: "Two of my favorite movie quotes are from famous comedies.

"In 'Dumb and Dumber,' one of the most famous quotes comes from Lloyd, as Mary
tells him there's a one-in-a-million chance for them to date. His response is:
'So you're tellin' me there's a chance?!'

"And from the classic 'Fletch' movie, as Fletch knocks on a cabana door, the
attractive woman who answers has just come out of the shower and is wearing
nothing but a towel. Fletch promptly asks: 'Can I borrow your towel? My car just
hit a water buffalo.'

"Great stuff."

Sounds of silence

AJ's Mom of "Casablanca-by-the-Sea" ("where the jasmine and the gardenias
perfume the air"): "One of my favorite pastimes is making compilation CDs for
friends and relations at Christmas or other special times, so I've been planning
my 'Hello, I Must Be Going' farewell one for some time now.

"AJ knows that 'Thunder Road,' by Bruce Springsteen, must be played -- and as
loud as possible. I'm hoping this will be a big party, on the order of my 21st
birthday or my St Patrick's Day wedding to his dad.

"Along with 'Thunder Road' are 'Dwelling in Beulahland,' by Helen Scheyer, a
'Morning Show' favorite, and 'The Mary Ellen Carter,' by Stan Rogers. These
three songs have given me hope in dark hours and, after 30 years, still bring a
lump to my throat. They are full of hope, not sadness."

ET's Wife of West St Paul: "ET left this world in January of 2012, after a few
years of failing health. He was almost 94 years old, but toward the end of his
journey, he took the time to write out what he wanted done at his funeral. He
hid it in an envelope at the bottom of one of his drawers. I didn't find it
until he had been gone a few days, but in time for his service at church. The
surprising thing was, we found a way to celebrate everything he wanted, and the
song he wanted was Henry Mancini's 'Two for the Road.' We had done a lot of
traveling in the 34 years we were married, and that was always what we used for
our theme. I found the tape, our music director found a way to play it over the
speakers, and it was used as the recessional.

"The lyrics are self-explanatory, I think. They are: 'If you're feeling fancy
free, come wander through the world with me, and any place we chance to be will
be a rendezvous. Two for the road, we'll travel through the years, collecting
precious memories, selecting souvenirs and living life the way we please. In
summertime the sun will shine, in winter we'll drink summer wine, and any day
that you are mine will be a lovely day. As long as love still wears a smile, I
know that we'll be two for the road, and that's a long, long while.'

"Thanks, ET, and many memories!"

Wise Old Woman of Blaine: "My choices of funeral music are recorded for the
family, but they know I won't be there to hold them to it. Some familiar hymns
include 'Now Thank We All Our God,' which was sung at our wedding and each of
the children's baptisms. The solo will be 'You Can Only Imagine,' and I've
included a prioritized list of soloists depending on who is available and
willing. The most important is the contemporary praise song 'We Will Dance on
the Streets That Are Golden,' and I don't know that anyone in our congregation
here in Minnesota knows it, so they may have to resort to a CD.

"I still need to write out my testimony, and may do a bit of a biography in my
own words.

"It is all coming together so well I'll be sorry to miss it.

Life as we know it

Al B of Hartland: "I was in a store, doing some light shopping. It was so light
that I hoped the store had a 'one item or less' checkout lane.

"After finding the thing I needed, I walked toward the checkout area. On my
journey there, I encountered a young mother in the company of four small
children who were heavily into wanting and needing. As I walked behind them for
a bit before I could find a passing lane, I couldn't help but hear them asking
for this and that. During that short period, the mother recited the 'shopping
with children' haiku. It went like this:

"No no no no no.

"No no no no no no no.

"No no no no no."

The Permanent Motherly/Daughterly Record

Hudson Grandmama: "Subject: Prom time.

"Twenty-five years ago, our daughter, Bridget, was a senior in high school and
going to her only prom. She'd found the perfect dress in a magazine: a Jessica
McClintock number in white, with pearls and sequins.

"The problem was finding it in a store. She and her friends had shopped for
several weekends at lots of stores, and although there were some nice dresses,
her heart was set on The Dress.

"One day at lunch, I stopped at a store in Ridgedale, and there it was. Most
stores didn't allow returns on prom dresses, but the salesperson said I could
take it home -- and if it wasn't the right size, I could bring it back the next
day.

"I got home from work before Bridget got home from playing tennis, so I put the
dress in her room. She was excited when she saw it -- and I'd picked the correct
size, so we had a winner.

"But the best part -- and to this day it makes me tear up -- was when I heard
her call her best friend, Rhonda, and the first words out of Bridget's mouth
were: 'Oh, Rhonda, my mom bought me The Dress.'

"Mothers of teenage girls are more often wrong than right, but sometimes, if
we're lucky, we can pull off a coup."

New squash courts spice sports menu at Buffalo Seminary

BYLINE: By Charles Garfinkel

SECTION: SPORTS; Racket sports; Pg. B8

LENGTH: 639 words


On Oct. 2 at approximately 3:30 p.m., Helen Marlette, the dean of students at
Buffalo Seminary was beaming as she witnessed the opening of the school's
beautiful new two-court squash facility.

"Two and a half years ago we realized that our old gym needed to be upgraded,"
Marlette said.

"The board and I spent many hours trying to decide how we could best utilize the
space. We arrived at a decision that we wanted to provide a sport that our
students could enjoy and utilize as a life-long sport. We also wanted a sport
that could also serve both Buffalo Seminary and the community. After
considerable research and investigation it was decided that squash would be the
best choice for our present and long range plans."

Marlette stressed that squash was an excellent choice for the school. The game
provides a great workout for two people in a small area, requires great
sportsmanship, competition and fun. The racket looks somewhat similar to a
tennis racket and is much lighter. The ball stays in play, giving each player a
chance to return the opponent's shot, which leads to long rallies. The bounce of
the ball also leads to relatively quick success in keeping the ball in play.
Equally important, the sportsmanship that the game commands is second to no
other sport.

Fortunately, Buffalo's own Gordon Anderson is one of the leading builders of
squash courts in the world. Anderson, who was once ranked No. 3 in the world and
is still one of the best senior players in the world, was magnanimous in lending
his time and expertise in helping his company build the Seminary facility and
its large viewing area.

The Bassett family was instrumental in offering a lead gift to help with the
building of the courts. Other donations followed and the facility became a dream
come true.

Seminary has 15 girls on its team, playing in a league with Nardin, Nichols, and
an independent team.

"The game of squash has really taken off throughout the country, especially at
the high school and collegiate level," Marlette said. "This past year's Junior
National Championships was the largest youth tournament of its kind in the
world."

At the college level, Trinity College of Hartford, Conn. has won the National
Team Championships an unprecedented 11 years in a row. About a year ago Sports
Illustrated wrote about Trinity's success and the fact it had won over 200
straight matches, one of the longest streaks in any sport.

Trinity coach Paul Assaiante was the featured speaker at the Buffalo Seminary
opening and conducted a clinic with Anderson for both the Buffalo Seminary and
invited Tapestry Charter and St. Monica Scholars students.

In the upcoming year, Seminary will be providing the courts to Tapestry and St.
Monica studentsat least an hour a week. This will give these students a chance
to play a sport that they otherwise might never have played.|

In addition, each student that is eligible will be getting an hour of tutoring
in reading at least once a week. Buffalo Seminary is also hoping to expand its
program to other schools in the community in the future.

Squash is offered as an elective at Buffalo Seminary to get as many students as
possible involved in the program.

"Although squash is a fun sport, it is also played at an extremely high level as
exemplified by all-time local greats such as Anderson and Rev. Bob
Hetherington," Marlette said.

Marlette hopes many of the girls who take up squash will eventually follow in
the steps of other local women who went on to star at various colleges.

These players include: Molly Anderson, Trinity; Phoebe Anderson, Brown; Mattie
McQueeney and Monica Wlodarczyk, Bowdoin; Julie Drury, Dartmouth; Laura Lynn
Drury, Penn; Erin Hart, Blake Carbone, and Sarah Kreiner, St. Lawrence; Betsy
Bloom and Sarah Bassett, Colgate and Courtney Leous, Hobart/William Smith.

Canterbury teen's return from injury 'incredible'

BYLINE: NANCY MORGAN

SECTION: NEIGHBORHOOD TIMES; TENNIS; Pg. 18

LENGTH: 599 words



Kris Goddard was back on the court this season, less that a year after
undergoing back surgery.

Kris Goddard has amazed his doctors, his tennis coach and himself.

Less than a year ago, the teenager underwent major back surgery and was fitted
with a brace from his neck to his belt line.

But this spring, Goddard, 17, played No. 2 singles and No. 1 doubles with senior
Kyle Nelson at Canterbury, reaching the Class 3A district final in both
positions and earning honorable mention on the Times all-county team. Also, he
is an honor student at the private school, where he just completed his junior
year.

"What Kris has done is incredible," said John Haggar, tennis director at the
Racquet Club of St. Petersburg and Goddard's coach at the club's Tournament
Players Academy. "After the surgery, Kris was very much out of shape, but his
timing and strokes weren't bad. I knew Kris had a lot of heart and he has
definitely shown it. Now, we treat him like he never had surgery."

Actually, Goddard has reminders of last October's surgery with four rods and
eight screws in his back. Doctors found two stress fractures in his back as well
as a cyst near his spinal canal.

"A couple of years ago, we moved here from Littleton, Colo., to train with Billy
Stearns when he was at Bardmoor," said Goddard. "I think it was when my workouts
went from a couple of hours to about six intense ones that I began to feel back
pain. Things just didn't get better, even when I took time off."

It was at last June's junior state closed competition in Orlando that Goddard
defaulted due to excruciating pain and an examination revealed the severity of
his injury.

This month, Goddard is again entered in the state closed event with hopes of
picking up where he left off.

"I am happy to play again, although I was pretty certain I would," said Goddard.
"I think I amazed my doctors, though.

"At first, I was nervous about playing. I had done pretty well in the 16s and
was motivated when I started in the 18s."

Goddard, who describes himself as an all-court player with a serve-and-volley
style, said he plays smarter now, knowing prolonged matches create a tired back.

"Since Kris has come back, we've been training to make an impression at this
month's state closed," said Haggar. "He's training hard and doing incredibly
well. Some college will be very lucky to have him."

Florida's closed junior competition is June 18-24 in the Orlando area for
players 18 and under.

ADULT PLAYOFFS: The first week of playoff action in the USA Adult Tennis League
resulted in women's wins for the Renaissance Vinoy and Feather Sound in the 3.0
and 3.5 divisions, for Treasure Island in 4.0, McMullen in 3.5 and East Lake in
3.5. Winning in the men's divisions were the Racquet Club in 3.5, 4.0 and 4.5;
Royal Racquet Club in 4.5 and Countryside in 3.5.

Playoff action continues Saturday, with a trip to regional competition at stake.

JUNIOR EVENT AT RACQUET CLUB: Axel Dumas of St. Petersburg defended his boys 12s
top seeding with a straight-set win over Robert Wald of Brandon in the final.
St. Petersburg's Kelly Nelson, No. 2 seed in the girls 18s, fell in two sets in
the final to Tampa's Lindsay Dawas, who upset the No. 1 seed in a semifinal.
Third-seeded Daigo Sakurai of Oldsmar reached the boys 16s final before losing
to top seed Francois Vandermeer of Bradenton.

Juniors should call Al Sarmiento at 360-2643 to register for the June 19-21 SPTC
Junior Open at the St. Petersburg Tennis Center. Singles and doubles with
consolations in each are offered in the state-sanctioned event.

Amelie Mauresmo won enough diamonds to last a lifetime Sunday.

Mauresmo earned a $1.3-million diamond-studded racket trophy, beating Kim
Clijsters 6-4, 7-6 (7-5) in the final of the Diamond Games.

The 8.8-pound gold racket trophy studded with 1,702 diamonds was for the first
player to win three titles in any five-year span.

"I said all week I didn't think about it, but honestly I thought about it the
whole week," said Mauresmo, who won in 2005 and last year.

SAP OPEN: Defending champion Andy Murray won his second career title,
neutralizing Ivo Karlovic's big serve to win a thrilling final 6-7 (3-7), 6-4,
7-6 (7-2) in San Jose, Calif. Murray proved to be the only player who had an
answer for the difficult serve of the 6-foot-10 Karlovic, who finished with a
tournament-record 113 aces.

OPEN 13: Gilles Simon won his first career title, beating seventh-seeded Marcos
Baghdatis 6-4, 7-6 (7-3) in Marseille, France.

BRAZIL OPEN: Wild card Guillermo Canas upset top-seeded Juan Carlos Ferrero 7-6
(7-4), 6-2 in Costa do Sauipe in his first win since returning from a 15-month
doping ban.

CHARGERS: Team officials interviewed New Orleans Saints defensive coordinator
Gary Gibbs in their search to replace the fired Marty Schottenheimer as coach.

IT'S BED AND BOUTIQUE;
 HOTEL WILL BE A SECOND ADDRESS FOR OUR GUESTS

BYLINE: LAURA DAVIS

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 7

LENGTH: 385 words


GUESTS will be able to check into Liverpool's first exclusive boutique hotel
later today.

Recently opened private members association The Racquets Club is to become the
latest in a growing list of luxury guest houses in the North West.

Boutique hotels Alias Ropewalks,in Liverpool city centr e, and Thornton Hough,
in Wirral,are also due to open their doors later this year.

Each of the eight bedrooms at the Racquets Club is individually decorated - in
styles from oriental minimalist chic with an 1850s desk and chair set and a
small garden outside the win do w, to country French with traditional,carved
beds.

Owner Martin Ainscough has filled the rooms with a blend of antiques and
contemporary fittings to reflect the decor of the club's other rooms. It will
cost pounds 80-pounds 100 a night to stay room onl y.

Mr Ainscough, who restored the building with his sister Helen, said: "The ethos
of the Racquet Hotel is to become a second address for our guests. We hope it
will offer visitors a unique accommodation experience when they stay in
Liverpool.

"We want our patrons to feel like family guests and our emphasis will be on
service that caters for the indi vidual."

Since being taken over by the Ainscoughs, the Racquets Clubhouses the relocated
wellkno wn Liverpool restaurant Ziba, a bar, private members rooms and a
smallgym.

Originally a gentlemen 's club,it had moved to its existing premises, the
Hargreaves Building on Chapel Street, after its original Upper Parliament Street
home was destroyed during the Toxteth riots of 1981.

The restoration is estimated to have cost pounds 700,000.

Boutique hotels are fast becoming the celebrity choice of places to stay when
away on holiday or business.

Didsbury House, near Manchester, has already attracted Hollywood heart-throb
Ethan Hawke, rock band Coldplay and former SpiceGirl Mel B as guests,despite
being open less than two years.

Alias Ropewalks will be housed in a con verted warehouse on the corner of
Concert Squareand SeelStreet.

The hotel will have 70 rooms and a Mediterranean -style restaurant
calledCafeParadiso.

In Wirral, property magnate Lee Magner is planning to convert part of the late
Lord Leverhulme's Thornton Manor estate into a luxury hotel and private members
club.

Another year of growth and activity at the St. Petersburg Tennis Center was
celebrated Saturday. The fifth annual Tennis Extravaganza treated guests to
fun, food and tennis throughout the day.

"Saturday's event reached my expectations," said Ray Sanderlin, chairman  of the
center'seight-member advisory committee the last four years. "It was a
successful event with lots of people of all ages having fun."

In addition to the activities, Joan Malone was recognized for her devotion  to
the center with presentation of the Linwood Lewallen Sportsmanship Trophy.

"Joan has been involved a long time and is very dedicated to the center  and its
activities," said Sanderlin. "It was good to honor her in this  way."

Hedy Hyanday was named the center's league captain of the year and Nelson  Aters
received the annual court etiquette award.

Participants were treated to a high-level, fast-paced mixed doubles  exhibition
featuring Janet Newberry, Liz Schroeder, Sam Vuille and Jeff Davis.

"The center has been around for so long and it's nice for players like us  to
participate in this event," said Davis. "We grew up as juniors on these  courts
and competed at various levels here."

Recently hired center manager Legnaly Villafane estimated there were about  300
participants.

WOMEN'S SINGLES: Six clubs are entered in this season's Pinellas County  Ladies
Suncoast Singles League. The Racquet Club, the Renaissance Vinoy,  Seminole
Lake, Safety Harbor Spa, East Lake Woodlands and Royal Racquet Club  compete
bi-weekly in six singles  positions.

Last week, Safety Harbor defeated the Racquet Club 6-0, Seminole beat the  Vinoy
5-1, and Royal Racquet tied 3-3 with East Lake. The next match is Nov.  20.

60-PLUS MEN: Shipwatch Tennis Club, Royal Racquet Club, East Lake Woodlands  and
Bardmoor Golf and Tennis Club are competing in the Pinellas Men's 60-Plus
Doubles League. Matches are on Tuesday afternoons and include five doubles
positions per team.

Last week, Shipwatch beat East Lake 5-0 and Royal edged Bardmoor 3-2.

GOOD LIFE AT SPTC: The St. Petersburg Tennis Center is the host site for  the
19th annual Good Life Games tennis competition through Friday. Women's,  men's

SOCCER BALLS STILL OUT OF BOUNDS AT RACQUET CLUB IN EDWARDSVILLE

BYLINE: Ron Cobb

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 2D

LENGTH: 1134 words


This is another in a series on St. Louis-area indoor clubs.  Joe and Constance
Krucky have owned Kettle River Racquet Club for four years and still haven't
converted it to soccer.  This probably comes as a surprise to the tennis players
in the Metro East area who were skeptical when the Kruckys took over the old
Cottonwood Racquet Club on Highway 159 in Edwardsville in December 1986. They
didn't like Joe Krucky's track record.  In 1983, he bought the Cave Springs
Tennis and Racquetball Club in St.  Peters. After one year, he took down the
nets, laid out a soccer field and changed the name to the Cave Springs Sports
Center.  Krucky's message to Kettle River players is this: Don't worry. He says
the circumstances were different in St. Peters. Only a few miles away was the
West James indoor club in St. Charles, and he surmised that only one tennis
facility could thrive in that area.  The competitive situation is better in
Edwardsville. The only other indoor clubs in the Metro East area are Oak Hill in
Belleville and St. Clair in O'Fallon.  ''We draw from as far away as 60 or 70
miles,'' Krucky said. ''To the north and east of us, there's nothing else.''
Krucky vows that he has no plans for soccer at Kettle River, although he makes
the clientele nervous when he arrives at the club carrying little soccer balls
from Cave Springs.  ''The people get in a panic,'' said Kettle River manager
Judi Joergensen. ''I say, 'No, no. That's his other club.' '' Joe Krucky is a
businessman, not a tennis player. In 1986, he was alerted by his accountant to a
newspaper ad for the bankruptcy sale of Cottonwood.  Krucky saw a potential
bargain, considering what it would cost to build a club from scratch.  ''It was
an area on the upswing,'' he said, ''and I-255 is now complete, there's a lot of
residential construction going on - expensive homes. I thought it would be a
good investment.'' He says he still is waiting for a payoff, inasmuch as much of
the money that the club has produced has gone back into the club. The
improvements have included a banquet hall that seats 300, an expanded pro shop,
a concession stand and improved lighting.  The non-membership club has five
tennis courts, five racquetball courts and also offers basketball, Wallyball,
aerobics and martial arts. A modest-but-growing junior tennis program is headed
by new pro Peter Williams, and the club fields six USTA Volvo League teams.
''We've had rough moments, but I like what I see,'' Krucky said. ''I've been
told a business like this doesn't really make money until you've been in
business nine years, although I don't know if I can wait that long to make
money.  ''But we're getting close, and I don't see any more expenditures until
the outdoor courts.'' Krucky says the foundation is in place for three outdoor
courts, but that project is several years away. He is considering installing a
sand volleyball pit outside next spring.  Joergensen, who has been at the
13-year-old club for eight years, said Krucky had an image problem to overcome
that related to more than just his soccer interests. The previous owner, she
said, ''was involved in too many others things, and the money he made here, he
used to pay other bills. When Joe bought it, people had a bad taste because of
the previous ownership.'' When the old club started requiring memberships, she
said, ''the people had a fit. There were grandiose ideas of putting in a pool
and outdoor courts, and it never happened.'' Krucky doesn't rule out a
membership policy down the road, but he knows he'll have to make the club
attractive enough to justify it.  ''When you buy something like this,'' Krucky
said, ''it takes time to nurture it, and it takes capital, too. I'm just an
average person, not a wealthy person, but I've learned a lot in my 55 years, and
I've put it to use.  Only time will tell what rewards we get out of this.''
Elsewhere: Captains of the USTA Volvo League were notified this week that,
effective immediately, they no longer must obey order of strength when making
out their lineups. In other words, they can position their players anywhere they
want, regardless of ability.  The rule ensures consistency at the local,
sectional and national levels.  Local coordinators Sue Winter and Donna
Schwartzman were against the change and would prefer that captains continue to
observe order of strength in making out lineups.

Tennis is such a simple game. There is a racket, a felt-covered ball, a net and
a court.

Compared to golf, with its ever- changing menu of high-power drivers, "hybrid"
irons, rescue clubs and new-age putters, tennis is meat and potatoes.

Or so it would seem.

But under the radar, change continues to infiltrate tennis. Call it the string
theory.

"I'm not sure a lot of people understand how much difference racket strings can
make, especially in Colorado, with our high altitude," said Adam Burbary, owner
of Denver- based tennis stores Game, Set and Match.

Even a casual fan knows that tennis rackets have changed dramatically over the
years, evolving from the tiny wooden models, to Jimmy Connors' famous steel
Wilson T2000 in the 1970s, to oversized Prince rackets in the 1980s, to
contemporary graphite models.

But nowadays, the string is the thing. Luxilon string, to be precise.

According to Time magazine, at this year's French Open, it was estimated that 65
percent of the men and 45 percent of the women use Luxilon strings. Those who
don't will use an imitation brand.

Luxilon strings are a polyester product designed by Luxilon Industries, a small
Belgian company specializing in medical sutures and bra straps. In tennis racket
stringing circles, Luxilon and similar brands are known as "poly" or "co-poly."

Luxilon strings were first popularized by Brazilian Gustavo Kuerten, who won the
French Open three times from 1997 to 2001. He generated incredible spin,
resulting in aggressive, dipping shots.

Today, players such as Roger Federer use poly strings or a hybrid combining poly
and natural gut. According to Burbary, Federer uses gut on the main
(up-and-down) strings and Luxilon for the cross strings.

"When Federer started doing that, he created the most amazing angles in the
sport," Burbary said.

To understand the genesis of tennis's string theory, a history lesson is in
order. Back in the 1970s, baseline phenom Bjorn Borg strung his wooden rackets
incredibly tight. So tight, in fact, that his rackets, or the strings, or both,
frequently broke - sometimes when they weren't even being used. What Borg was
after was controlled power and heavy topspin.

Those who watch tennis on TV today will no doubt hear commentators discuss these
newfangled strings that allow players to swing harder and with more spin than
ever before. What the pros seek is a string that allows them to swing hard, put
great "English" on the ball, yet not have a ball fly into the grandstands.

Polyester strings are becoming pervasive, displacing the old gold standard,
natural gut (strands of sterilized cow entrails). Also, poly strings are
extremely durable.

At Game, Set and Match, tennis players frequently ask about Luxilon, some
believing it a cure-all for what ails their game. The better players, especially
up-and-coming junior players, buy the poly strings.

But the so-called super string is not for the beginner or the average club
player. Burbary said that 70-80 percent of his customers are women who play in
area leagues. Many have, or have had, problems with tennis elbow. Luxilon is not
for them.

"It's a very unforgiving string," he said.

Burbary also said it's important for tennis players to understand the importance
of getting their racket strung properly, especially in Colorado where the ball
tends to fly.

"We have people come in all the time to try out demo rackets," he said. "They
will spend a lot of time picking out a racket, but a lot of players don't spend
more than five minutes thinking about the string and the right tension. They'd
be better players if they reconsidered that."

Patrick Saunders: 303-954-1428 or psaunders@denverpost.com --------- High strung

There are a variety of tennis strings on the market. A closer look:

Natural gut: Provides both power and control, but it is the most expensive
string and the least durable. Natural gut is produced by drying fibers from cow
intestine.

Synthetic gut: A widely used product, it's made from a wide range of artificial
materials, usually combining nylon and polyester. It's cheaper, more durable and
easier to manufacture than natural gut.

Polyester: These strings are typically stiff and lifeless, but very durable.
They were originally intended for highly skilled players who broke natural-gut
strings too frequently. Because of the low elasticity and low power, players are
able to swing hard and still put a lot of spin on the ball. Poly strings have
become extremely popular on the pro tour.

Tennis center racks up men's doubles wins

BYLINE: NANCY MORGAN

SECTION: NEIGHBORHOOD TIMES; TENNIS; Pg. 14

LENGTH: 578 words



The St. Petersburg Tennis Center team just keeps winning and winning in the
Pinellas Men's 60-and-Over Doubles League.

Six matches equal six wins and the lead in the 3-year-old league.

Sharing second place with a 4-2 overall record are Royal Racquet Club,
Shipwatch A and Countryside Country Club. All three have lost to SPTC; Royal's
second loss was to Countryside, Countryside's to Shipwatch A and Shipwatch A's
to Royal.

"St. Pete Tennis Center is just a tough team," said Vince Trapano, league
coordinator and teaching professional at Royal Racquet. "They have quality
players that know high-level doubles."

Against Royal Racquet Club last week, St. Petersburg won all five doubles
positions, four in straight sets. Dennis McDaniel and Dave Krebs needed three
sets in No. 2. Straight-set winners included Leo Pullen and Bob Myerdierks in
No. 1, captain John Hahn and Peter Spyers-Ducant at No. 3, Charlie Durrell and
Andy Chau in No. 4, and Michel Antoine and Doug Eadie at No. 5.

Shipwatch A defeated Countryside 5-0 last week on the play of Charles  Brusovich
and Doug Godinho in No. 1, Al Heller and Don Kelly in No. 2, Tom  Howard and
Roger Pearson in No. 3, Don Moffat and Chee Darwin in No. 4 and  Henry VanGoren
and Jerry Peace at No. 5.

Shipwatch B earned its first win last week over winless Seminole Lake  Racquet
Club. Shipwatch's wins came from John Finlayson and Bob Knoth in No.  1, Peter
Priston and Dennis Rosendale in No. 2, Johnnie Howard and Bill Grampp  at No. 3
and Ray Eichler and John Scoble in No. 4. Henry Lipps and Clare  McCreary won in
No. 5 for Seminole.

League play resumes Jan. 7.

SUNCOAST LEADERS: East Lake Woodlands leads Harbour Island by a point in  the
Suncoast Ladies Doubles League. Bardmoor is third while Cheval and Royal
Racquet Club are tied for fourth. Competition resumes next month.

WOMEN'S LEAGUE SIGNUPS: Teams may still register for the South Pinellas  Ladies
Doubles League by calling coordinator Sam Vuille at 867-9105. Each team
consists of two doubles positions for both the 3.0 and 3.5 divisions.

League play is on Wednesday mornings and begins Jan. 15.

SULLIVAN'S HOMECOMING: Lakewood Country Club was Sunday's site for the  annual
Dan Sullivan Homecoming Invitational. Forty-four players - all students  of
longtime teaching professional Dan Sullivan - competed in a round-robin  format.
The top four players - Bill Funk, Mike Reilly, Jeff Beck and Ralph  Howe -
forced a playoff with Howe taking first place.

Among players participating were tennis professional Betsy Nagelson ,  Davidson
tennis coach Jeff Frank, Jeff Davis, Drew Wager, Hugh O'Rourke, Eddie  Rese and
Ed Jagger.

MIXED UPDATE: Bardmoor raised its record to 2-1 last weekend with a 3-0 win
over St. Petersburg Tennis Center  in the U.S. Tennis Association District 12
Mixed Doubles League. Bardmoor's Kay Caldwell and Gerry Miller defeated SPTC's
Vicki and Ray Tuller in straight sets at No. 1, as did Pat and Frank Bellcourt
over Joan Malone and Ray Sanderlin in No. 3. Virginia Mauldin and Darwin Chee
needed three sets to beat Rosemary Pisani and Morgan O'Brien.

COMING UP: The St. Petersburg Tennis Center hosts the only Dec. 28-30  Pinellas
adult tournament. Tournament director Al Sarmiento is taking  registration
through today for women's and men's singles and doubles in a  variety of age
divisions. Call the center at 893-7301 or Sarmiento at  360-2643.

What you need to get started

BYLINE: Susan Stevens, Daily Herald Health Writer

When it comes to gear, tennis is easy.

Tennis whites are no longer required, though some clubs prohibit jeans or
cut-offs. Unless you aspire to Serena or Venus Williams' fashion sense, you
probably have something in your closet that will work.

And even with new high-tech materials, entry-level rackets cost less than you
might spend on your tennis shoes.

"You can get a very nice racket for under $100," says Paul Roetert, managing
director of the U.S. Tennis Association's high- performance lab in Key Biscayne,
Fla.

More important, Roetert says, is finding a racket that fits you. Rackets range
in length and the size of the string pattern; a larger racket comes with a
bigger "sweet spot," making it easier to hit the ball, but you lose some
maneuverability.

Looks for a racket that feels comfortable in your hands, says Matt Davis, head
tennis pro at River Trails Tennis Center in Mount Prospect. Make sure the grip
is the proper size; when you grasp the handle, you should have enough room to
fit a finger beneath your hand and still have your fingers touch.

"You want to have the correct grip so you don't have tennis elbow or shoulder
problems," he said.

Some rackets are designed to minimize vibration in the handle, which can make
playing more comfortable. Some are weighted more toward the handle, others more
toward the tip. String tension will also vary.

Rather than choosing a racket on your own, Roetert advises seeking help from a
certified tennis professional, who is trained to recommend rackets for specific
players.

If you're taking lessons, your instructor is a good place to start. Pro shops in
tennis clubs often will let you try a racket out before committing to a
purchase.

When you buy your racket, pick up a few cans of tennis balls as well. You'll
need them. Tennis balls don't improve with age; the felt wears off, and pressure
loss makes them sluggish.

Pros replace their balls every set. Beginners can probably get three or four
hours out of a can, said Chris Moreno, tennis pro at Naperville Tennis Club.

"If you were an advanced player, you would use a new can every time you played,"
he said.

If you're playing outdoors, consider wrist bands to keep sweat off your hands,
and don't forget sunscreen and a hat.

Sport-specific shoes are a good idea.

"Running shoes are made for running forward, where tennis shoes have better
lateral support," Roetert said. "That's crucial for good tennis shoes."

Be sure they don't have black soles that will leave marks on the court.

GRAPHIC: Why it's bad to have love - Tennis scoring proceeds from 15, to 30, to
40 to game. A score of zero is "love." If the server makes the first point, the
score is "15-love." - A player must be ahead by two points to win the game. If
the score progresses to 40-40, or "deuce," one player must first win the
advantage, and then the next point to win the game. If the server wins the
advantage, it's called "ad in." If the receiver wins the point after deuce, it's
"ad out." If the player with the advantage fails to win the next point, the
score returns to deuce. - When a player has won six games, he or she has won a
set. The first player to win two sets wins the match. - Why the funny scores?
Tennis has French and medieval origins. Love is thought to be a derivation of
"l'oeuf," or egg, indicating nothing. Deuce is a corruption of deux, meaning two
exchanges are needed to win. Because the score progresses in 15-point
increments, 40 could just be an abbreviation of 45.

The Aces will be practicing a special kind of racketeering Saturday. They close
their home schedule Saturday when they face the New York Buzz at 7:05 p.m. at
Dwight Davis Tennis Center at Forest Park. As part of their ongoing support of
junior tennis, the Aces are sponsoring Rackets for Kids. Anyone who donates a
used racket will be given free admission. Tickets normally cost $25.

The rackets will be used by members of the Aces' Kids Club, many of whom can't
afford equipment. The Aces also donate tickets to club members who cannot buy
them and stage clinics with team members.

For more information, call the Aces at 314-726-2237.

Rain on Monday night forced the Aces to move their match against the Kansas City
Explorers to Forest Lake Tennis Club after a delay. The match was originally
scheduled for Dwight Davis. It was the second time in their eight-year history
that the Aces were rained out at Dwight Davis.

LESSER RACKET GETTING LUCKY,MAY-JUNE 1936 CHAPTER 118

BYLINE: BY JAY MAEDER

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 25

LENGTH: 867 words

IN SPECIAL PROSECUTOR Thomas Dewey, the energetic young racket smasher who
visibly enjoyed making headlines every bit as much as he enjoyed smashing
rackets, Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia found a kindred spirit, and the mayor, who had
always liked to go out and, say, sledgehammer a few slot machines when he had
nothing else to do, now was moved to help out wherever he could as the freshly
appointed Dewey started rolling up dozens of convictions. In December 1935, for
example, LaGuardia personally raided the Bronx Terminal Market and issued a
citywide ban on the retail sale of artichokes. Old Ciro Terranova, the Artichoke
King, was very upset.

But there were more important targets than vegetable czars and small-time
mobsters inside the restaurant business and needle trades. In early 1936 in the
City of New York, everyone knew that the town's No. 1 crimelord was 39-year-old
Salvatore Lucania, aka Charles Luciano, aka Charlie Lucky. Luciano, though, was
an intelligent businessman, operating through shells. People whispered about
"the boss," but no one ever saw him, and no one ever dealt with him directly.
Crimebusters Dewey and LaGuardia now held a council of war, and the mayor came
out foursquare and vigorously behind Dewey's declaration that it was time to
bring the big man down.

The untouchable Luciano contemptuously laughed off the newspaper reports that
Dewey intended to nail him and went about his affairs, which included a holiday
in the salutary waters of Hot Springs, Ark. Amazed was he when he was snatched
off a resort street one day in early April and extradited to New York to stand
trial on charges that he controlled the city's $12 million-a-year vice
operations.

Police and press and underworld were equally surprised. Charlie Lucky was known
to have his hands in lots of enterprises. But prostitution was probably the one
thing he wasn't involved in.

LUCIANO WAS mortified. He was a gentleman, he sputtered; he had nothing to do
with the flesh rackets. Bookmaking he would admit to. Maybe a couple of other
dodges. But girls?

When he came to court with eight co-defendants in mid-May, his lawyers found
what they were up against. Dewey and his racket busters had spent months raiding
bordellos, jailing dozens of whores and leaning on them for testimony. A parade
of colorful floozies with such names as "Jenny the Factory" and "Cokey Flo
Brown" took the stand to drop hints that "the boss" was somebody named
"Charlie." Dewey painted them all as public heroines resolved to free the
captive city of its shackles in brave defiance of threats against their lives.
The defense painted them as lying hopheads, plainly paid off and carefully
coached. There was little question about the guilt of Luciano's co-defendants.
As for Charlie Lucky himself, the hard evidence that he was associated with any
of the rest of them was really quite thin.

He was his own worst witness, though, crumbling under Dewey's sneering
cross-examination, letting himself get caught in one untruth after another. In
particular, he swore that he didn't know Ciro Terranova. Phone records from his
Waldorf-Astoria suite quickly proved him a liar. While this had nothing to do
with the compulsory prostitution charges at hand, it did make a known gangster
out of him.

Which was enough for the jurors, who, after four weeks of trial, got the case at
9:31 p.m., Saturday the 6th of June, and came back at 5:30 a.m. Sunday with
enough guilty verdicts against Charlie Lucky to theoretically put him behind
bars for somewhere between 1,200 and 1,800 years.

What he got was 30 to 50. "But I'm innocent," he bewilderedly protested at
sentencing on the 17th. By nightfall that same day, he was behind the gates of
Sing Sing.

"WE DIDN'T think," the Daily News had to agree, "the evidence proved beyond a
reasonable doubt that Luciano was in the prostitution racket....Our feeling is
that the jury convicted Luciano and his associates more because they were
obviously dangerous racketeers than because they had been proved technically
guilty of compulsory prostitution."

Dewey, basking in his triumph, all but conceded the point himself. "This was not
a vice trial," Dewey told reporters. "It was a racket prosecution. Control of
organized prostitution in New York was one of the lesser rackets of the
defendants."

So the point was that, as Luciano's lawyers kept blustering, Dewey had sent
their man up on anything he could get. On the other hand, of course: So what?

THE FACT THAT Charlie Lucky had been, fairly unprecedentedly, convicted of an
actual crime, as opposed to merely the federal tax violations that had knocked
off Al Capone and Waxey Gordon, was not lost on fellow gangland figures who
recognized that Dewey could make even stronger cases against the likes of
themselves. The special prosecutor had already announced that his next targets
would be the labor goons Louis Buchalter, aka Lepke, and Jacob Shapiro, aka
Gurrah, both of whom were electing to make themselves scarce.

As for the shining knight Tom Dewey, people were already talking him up as the
next governor. Why, a fellow like Dewey, he probably even had the stuff to go on
to the White House someday.

Two Adult League men's teams reach state tournament

BYLINE: NANCY MORGAN

SECTION: LARGO TIMES; TENNIS; Pg. 4

LENGTH: 1123 words



Two local men's teams are a step closer to national competition after last
weekend.

Eight local teams competed in Longboat Key in the three-day USA Adult League
West Regional Championships, with two returning as champions and three finishing
second.

The Racquet Club of St. Petersburg advanced its 3.5 men's team and Bardmoor Golf
and Tennis Club qualified its 4.0 men's squad. The Racquet Club's 4.5 men
narrowly missed advancing and finished second, as did Feather Sound Country
Club's 3.0 women's team and the Renaissance Vinoy's 3.5 women's team.

The women's 4.5 squad from McMullen in Clearwater was third, as was the men's
5.0 based at the Treasure Island Golf, Tennis and Recreation Center. Treasure
Island Tennis and Yacht Club's 4.0 women's team finished fourth.

"This was one of the best weekends of tennis," said Bob Dickerson, captain of
the Racquet Club 3.5 squad. "We knew Hunter's Green in Tampa would be our
toughest team and we had kind of a lucky draw. We played them our first match
after they had already had a match that morning."

After being up 2-1 against Hunter's Green with wins from John McQuillen in No. 2
singles and Scott Stewart and Scott Johnston in No. 1 doubles, the Racquet Club
got two more victories from Mike Williams in No. 1 singles and Jack Weldon and
Earl Gehant in No. 3 doubles for a 4-1 victory.

"The match was a really close one, just like we expected it to be," said
Dickerson. "The other two matches we also won 4-1 against Bonita Springs and
Fort Myers, but both times the matches were close with stiff competition."

The Racquet Club was to play a team from Sarasota in its final match in the
round-robin format, but the Sarasota team arrived past the default time and was
declared ineligible. A win or a loss by Sarasota would not have affected the
overall outcome, said Dickerson.

While this will be the Racquet Club's first trip to the state tournament,
Bardmoor Golf and Tennis Club's 4.0 men's team is making its second since 1997.

"It seemed someone different stepped up in each match and made the difference
for us," said Dan Callahan, captain of the Bardmoor 4.0 team. "The championship
wasn't wrapped up until nearly the end."

Gene Crouse and John Beda were a consistent doubles team, netting victories in
whatever position they defended, said Callahan. The tiebreak format also worked
to Bardmoor's advantage, added Callahan, with the team winning five of eight
played.

"I can tell you it is certainly easier to play than to watch," said Callahan,
who supported his team from the sidelines. "Our matches that we won 5-0 against
Fort Myers and 4-1 over Tampa were both very close."

On the last day, Bardmoor met Naples and was down 2-1 before Mike Collins and
Doug Godinho pulled out a third-set win and Crouse and Beda added a third
position win for the team title.

"I thought we had a good shot at winning before we went to regionals," said
Callahan. "We were undefeated in the district playoffs and were on a roll with
seven consecutive team match wins."

Also playing for Bardmoor were Jeff Sprague and Richard Farci, who were 3-1 in
singles, and Bill Simmers, Don Kirby, Tom Byrd, Bard Yerger, Tim Kahle and Matt
Fox.

The USA Adult League state tournament is Aug. 13-15 in Altamonte Springs.
Joining the Racquet Club and Bardmoor men's teams will be the Safety Harbor Spa
5.0 women's team, the Feather Sound 3.0 men's squad, and possibly two men's 5.5
teams.

INTERSECTIONAL CHAMPIONSHIPS: Lori Grey of Seminole is one of six players
selected to represent Florida in next week's USTA 18 Intersectional Team
Championships in San Rafael, Calif. Reinaldo Valor of Clearwater, Aleksey Bubis
of Palm Harbor and Kyle Nelson of St. Petersburg make up half of the six-member
boys team that will play in Columbia, S.C. Competition concludes Tuesday.

ZONE CHAMPIONSHIPS: Pinellas players Elena Berry, Rachel Silverberg and George
Navas are among 25 girls and 25 boys from Florida in Nashville, Tenn., through
Friday for the USTA 12 Zone Team Championships. Round-robin team singles,
doubles and mixed doubles are scheduled with teams from the Caribbean,
Mid-Atlantic, Midwest and Southern USTA sections.

Saturday, Jennifer Dent, Tiffanie Kalvoda, Kelly Nelson and Natalie Tirapelli
will begin competition in the USTA 16 Zone Team Championships in Winston-Salem,
N.C. In all, 20 girls and 20 boys from Florida were invited to participate in
the round-robin format against teams from the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest and Southern
sections. The zonals conclude Aug. 5.

SECTIONAL CHAMPIONSHIPS: Kayla Kennedy participated on the winning girls team
and Marc Sawyer on the boys winner in the inaugural Florida Team Championships
held this month in Jacksonville. Five teams of five players each competed in
both the girls and boys 14 divisions. Loren Butler was a member of the girls
finalist team, as was Brandon Pierpont of the boys.

Also competing at the sectional contest were local players Katie Fenzl and Haley
Dodson.

LOCAL COMPETITION: Brandon Anandan of Dunedin, son of Clearwater teaching
professional Krishnan Anandan, defeated Sekou Bangoura of Bradenton, son of
Sekou Bangoura, director of the Bangoura International Tennis Academy, in this
month's Summer Classic state-sanctioned junior tournament in Clearwater. Anandan
won in straight sets in the boys 10-and-under division. Morgan Frank also won in
straight sets in the girls 10 final, and Rafael Kucharski of Clearwater was a
finalist in the boys 18s.

Joan Simmons captured the women's 30-and-over championship in the Pro Star Adult
Summer Slam held at the Pro Star Tennis Club in Clearwater. Ed Jagger won the
men's 30s singles and Shri Anandan won the 40s in the state-sanctioned event.

GREY SISTERS WIN: Sisters Christa and Lori Grey, graduates of Seminole High
School, teamed to win their second consecutive International Tennis Association
open-division doubles title in an ITA collegiate tournament staged at Georgia
Tech this month. Younger sister Lori won her second consecutive open-division
singles championship.

This fall, Christa begins her junior year at the University of Georgia and Lori
will be an incoming freshman at the Division I school. Both girls were awarded
full tennis scholarships.

YOUR CALL: According to Frank Deford in the June 28, 1999, issue of Sports
Illustrated, men's tennis is in a slump and without excitement, primarily due to
the power of the serve. Deford offered a variety of solutions, from moving the
server farther behind the baseline to making the service box smaller. Also,
Deford suggests that shorter sets and more tiebreakers would create excitement.

Squash: Menlo Park's Morgan training for Jr. World Championships

Daily News Staff Writer

Gabriel Morgan is traveling in fast squash company. Morgan, a senior at Menlo
School-Atherton in the fall, is training with professional squash players, Greg
Gaultier and Amr Shabana at a camp in McLean, Va.

Shabana, a four-time world champion, was ranked No. 1 in the world in 2006.
Coaching at the camp is Shahier Razik, a retired professional.

Morgan, a member of Team USA, is getting ready for the Junior World Junior
Squash Championships in Eindhoven, Netherlands, which starts July 21. This is
Morgan's first trip to a World Championship.

"I'm training hard," Morgan said. "I'm getting physically strong and fit. I
should be at my peak by the time Worlds start."

Morgan was an integral part of Menlo's championship tennis team in the spring,
as the Knights won the Central Coast Section and Northern California crowns.

A squash racket is a little smaller and lighter than a tennis racket, Morgan
said.

"It's racket skills," Morgan said. "I'm a finesse player and like to use my
head. I want to expose the opponent's weaknesses."

Morgan has played squash since he was 9, but kept on his tennis game, at the
same time.

"I played both sports because I didn't want to burn out playing just one of
them," Morgan said.

After training with the pros, Morgan heads to Yale University where he'll train
with the National Junior Team.

Morgan has been nominated to represent the U.S. at the 2015 Pan-American Junior
Games, Aug. 31 through Sept. 6, in Resistencia, Argentina. He will find out
within a week if he will get the nod.

"My goal is to represent the U.S. the best I can," Morgan said. "It's a great
honor."

A member of the Professional Squash Association (PSA), Morgan has a world
ranking of No. 343. He is ranked in the top five in the United States among
players under 19.

In September, Morgan plays in the qualifying round of the $100,000 PSA 2015
NetSuite Open Squash Championships, held at Justin Herman Plaza in San
Francisco.

Pinellas County dominates fall league

BYLINE: NANCY MORGAN

SECTION: NEIGHBORHOOD TIMES; TENNIS; Pg. 18

LENGTH: 958 words



Pinellas players were tops among the K-Swiss Fall League champions crowned this
month.

Seven of the 10 men's divisions, five of nine women's singles titles and one of
three mixed doubles championships were captured by county players.

For Radhika Mukkamala of St. Petersburg, the women's 4.5 champion, it was her
first time to play in the flex league.

"This league is really convenient, especially if you work," said Mukkamala, 23.
"In a league structured like this, when you have a week to play your opponent,
it's easy to find the time."

Mukkamala, a 1999 West Virginia University graduate and member of the WVU team,
hadn't had much opportunity to play since graduation.

As a result of joining the K-Swiss League, however, not only did Mukkamala
increase the frequency of playing but improved her game.

"I have always relied on my aggressive shots - both at the baseline and with my
approach shots," she said.

"I had gotten a little rusty since I hadn't been playing much," Mukkamala said.
"Playing more regularly, though, really improved that, plus I got more used to
playing on the soft surfaces."

Mukkamala posted a 5-2 regular-season record to earn a top seed. In the
playoffs, two wins advanced her to the final against Donna Seider. Mukkamala won
7-5, 6-1.

"I'm looking forward to playing the next league," Mukkamala said, "and I guess
I'll be in the next higher level. That will be a good challenge."

Also enjoying straight-set victories among the women were Martha Cornatzer
(3.5-minus), Becky Van Gaele (4.0-minus) and Anne Conseen (4.5-minus).

In 3.5, Cheryl Briske was forced to the limit but won 6-4, 6-7, 7-6 over Mary
Lynn Hanner.

The fall season wasn't John Radford's first, but it was the first time he won.

Radford finished second in the regular season and won three matches to reach the
men's 3.5-minus final with Steve Wycallis. A 7-6, 6-4 victory advances Radford
to the 3.5 division next season.

"I always try to take advantage of my topspin forehand and get to the net on my
first serve," Radford said. "Things were working for me, although it was a tough
final match."

Luis Meleadez (3.0), Mitch Golden (4.5-minus), Tim Jennings (4.5) and Frederic
Guerrier (5.0) also collected two-set victories.

John Savage scrambled from a first-set loss to capture the 3.5 title, 5-7, 6-3,
7-6. Greg Montesante won the 5.5 by a default in the title match.

Amanda Olivier teamed with Joshua Esposito to overtake challengers Jayne and
Mike Bedovsky in the 6.5 mixed doubles championship, 3-6, 6-4, 7-6.

Heather Kunkler and Kent Walling won the 7.5 mixed, and Carol Cotney and Albert
Alhadeff took the 9.5.

In women's doubles, Cindy Cooper and Dawn Embrey were first in 7.5, and Peggy
Blank and Tina Goldfield won the 6.5.

The K-Swiss Spring League is scheduled for Feb. 16-April 7. The playoff
tournament is May 4-5. Players may register through Jan. 31 by calling (727)
865-0615 or going online to www.ultimatetennis.com.

SENIOR LEAGUES: USA Tennis Florida Senior Doubles League action last week
included 2-1 victories by Treasure Island Tennis and Yacht Club and St.
Petersburg Tennis Center in the 3.5 women's division.

Scoring straight-set wins for Treasure Island over Countryside Country Club were
Margaret Scheidt and Cynthia Apter (No. 1) and Jan Hanson and Karen Winiecki
(No. 3).

St. Petersburg's Hedy Hunyady and Kathy Light rebounded from a first-set loss to
win at No. 1 in three sets. SPTC's second point came from an East Lake Woodlands
default at No. 3.

On the men's side, the Racquet Club scored a 2-1 victory over Feather Sound
Country Club in the 3.5 South division, and the Racquet Club beat Shipwatch
Tennis Club in the 3.5 Central.

Newton Rogers and Marty Normile (No. 1) and Nick Pavonetti and Gary Elliott (No.
3) won for the Racquet Club.Bob Dilonardo and Phillip Sealund (No. 2) scored
Feather Sound's only point.

David Laesser and Steve Uebel (No. 1) and Ron Whitaker and Russ Barlow (No. 3)
won for the Racquet Club. Henry VanDrunen and Buzz Zinn (No. 3) posted a victory
for Shipwatch.

MIXED DOUBLES: Bardmoor Golf and Tennis Club won its second consecutive match in
USA Tennis Florida.

Straight-set victories from Sylvia and Bob Hagerman (No. 1) and Erika Boardman
and Jim Foster (No. 3) led Bardmoor past the Racquet Club of St. Petersburg in
the 7.5 senior competition.

Rosemary and Steve Uebel earned the Racquet Club's lone point.

Bardmoor won its match in the 8.5 senior division.

In the 8.5 adult mixed action, the Racquet Club beat Royal Racquet Club with
wins from Maria Drew and Earl Gehant (No. 1) and Linda Miller and Mitchell Lee

Former pro Gadusek, new club owner thrive in business

BYLINE: NANCY MORGAN; DARRELL FRY

SECTION: NORTH PINELLAS TIMES; tennis; Pg. 4

LENGTH: 893 words

DATELINE: CLEARWATER



CLEARWATER - Call it fate, fortune or good luck, but the Royal    Racquet Club
has a successful blend with Pittsburgh's Tim Szazynski as    the new owner and
former tennis professional Bonnie Gadusek as the    tennis director.

      Szazynski's ownership and Gadusek's directorship have gone through    six
months. Both are pleased.

      "I really like teaching, although I found teaching tougher than I
thought it would be," Gadusek said. "Not only is it difficult to be    out in
the sun all day, but it's also mentally tough as you think about    each pupil
and what they need."

      Gadusek teaches more than 20 hours a week at the Clearwater    facility
and works with players ranging from tots to 80-year-olds. She    offers her
expertise to people who never have touched a racket and    those rated at the
5.0 USTA level.

      "When I first started teaching at Royal, there were some members    who
felt somewhat intimidated by the fact I had been a professional    player," said
Gadusek, who was ranked eighth in the world in 1985.    "But if they got up
enough courage to give me a try, they would see    that I could put them at ease
and make them feel comfortable on the    court."

      When Szazynski purchased Royal Racquet Club in April membership
numbered 84. It has grown to about 130. He would like the club to have    about
300 members.

      "Being in a growing area like Pinellas, and with Bonnie here and    the
levels of players we already have, Royal can easily be the mecca of    Pinellas
club players," Szazynski said.

      Szazynski has experience in building a successful club. After    starting
in the home-remodeling business in Pittsburgh and transforming    a purchased
hardware store into an athletic store, Szazynski developed    a facility with
indoor and outdoor tennis courts, a skating rink, a    mall and a golf course.
The development took five years. Membership    grew to 1,400 in four months.

      "All we need at Royal is to push the right button for    membership,"
Szazynski said. "I feel we're on schedule now."

      The combination of Gadusek and Szazynski dates back to 12 years    ago,
when Gadusek, then 13, appeared in a junior development program at
Szazynski's Pittsburgh club. After her professional playing career
(1981-1987), Szazynski approached Gadusek about teaching at a club in    Deer
Creek, Fla., that he hoped to purchase. That deal fell through,    but Szazynski
discovered Royal Racquet Club during his visit to the    state.

      "I really was eager to buy Royal," Szazynski said. "The members
attempted to purchase it on their own, but when they realized they    couldn't,
I was ready."

      Gadusek is happy working with Szazynski and teaching at Royal    Racquet
Club. She no longer plays tennis but enjoys spending her free    time shopping
or going to the beach. Her major physical activity    besides teaching involves
working out at a fitness center three or four    times a week.

      "My primary goal in teaching is to to keep everyone active and    happy,"
Gadusek said. "I'm not worried about schedules or numbers of    players. I just
want to give everyone what they want through my    teaching."

      For Gadusek, teaching has opened a new chapter in life. She likes    the
story so far.



     Fourth in East: West Virginia University freshman Michelle    Tondreault of
St. Petersburg finished fourth at the Eastern Collegiate    Tennis Championships
last week in Camden, N.J.        It was another good showing from Tondreault, a
St. Petersburg    Catholic graduate who was the university's Athlete of the Week
in    September. She has moved from sixth to fourth on the Mountaineers
women's squad this season, compiling a 7-1 record in singles    competition.



        Volvo team returns: Royal Racquet Club's 4.0 men's team finished
fourth in the nation in the USTA/Volvo team tennis national tournament    in Sea
Brook, S.C., last week. Seventeen teams qualified for the    competition. Royal
Racquet defeated four teams before losing 3-2 in a    semifinal to Missouri
Valley, the eventual national champion.



        NTRP event: Wednesday is the deadline for a sanctioned NTRP    adult
tournament scheduled for Oct.29-31 at East Lake Woodlands.

 Players with USTA ratings no higher than 4.5 should call 785-2212.



     Something for everyone: November events offer competition for all    ages.
Largo kicks off the annual Barnett Bank Good Life Games with    Senior Olympics
Nov.2 at Bayhead Complex (587-6721); Nov.5-6 is the    Clearwater Tennis Club
junior singles tournament (462-6144); Nov.11-13,    the Holiday Classic for
adults in Tampa (933-4011); Nov.12-14, adults    in St. Petersburg (894-4378)
and juniors at Innisbrook (942-2000);

 Nov.19-21, adults at Paradise Island (360-6062); and Nov.25-27, adults    at
Innisbrook (942-2000).

Tennis set to crack down on racquets

SECTION: SPORTSWEEK; Pg. 5

LENGTH: 280 words


London, Saturday.

LEADING players and racquet manufacturers have been invited to a pre- Wimbledon
summit to discuss ways of reducing the impact of technology on tennis.

Representatives from equipment manufacturers and the men's and women's tours
will attend the meeting the week before Wimbledon to debate the effects powerful
modern racquets have on the game.

An International Tennis Federation spokesman said that: "We think the time has
come when, although these racquets are very good for players of lower standard,
we've got to consider everybody."

"We've been talking a lot already, but we thought we ought to get all the
interested parties together.

Basically, we are looking at ways to make the game more entertaining."

There was widespread criticism during Wimbledon last year that the men's game,
especially on grasscourts, had become boring.

The ITF also announced that 16 wildcard places will be available in the men's
and women's singles at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta.

A maximum of four players from a country will be allowed to compete in the
64-draw singles events, with one pair from each nation permitted in the doubles.
The singles format will try to ensure that players from the same country do not
meet in the first round.

The ITF has ruled that Brazil must forfeit home advantage for its next Davis Cup
tie after failing to comply with competition regulations against the Bahamas in
February.

South Africa has been told it must accept ITF supervision next time it plays at
home after failing to provide an acceptable court for the world group tie
against Australia last month.

Play was impossible on the first day because the newly laid hardcourt surface
broke up in rain.

''Psychology is very strong in tennis,''  Eric Babolat was saying. He was
speaking to me from France, where his  family-owned company, Babolat, has its
headquarters; at age 37, Eric is  from the fifth generation of Babolats to run
it.

True enough, psychology  is important in any tennis match. But that's not really
what Babolat was  referring to. Rather, he was talking about the relationship
between a  player and his racket, how the right racket can bring to mind that
line  from ''Sweeney Todd'': ''At last, my right arm is complete!'' And from a
commercial point of view, he was talking about another kind of  psychology, the
kind that can cause a piece of sports equipment to  become the ''it'' racket.

Eric should know. Though his company has been  around since the dawn of modern
tennis itself -- his  great-great-grandfather, who sold strings for musical
instruments,  created the first natural gut string in 1877 -- it was only 13
years ago  that his father, the late Pierre Babolat, made the decision to
manufacture a racket. Six years later, in 2000, the company began  selling its
Pure Drive line of rackets in the United States.

In  retrospect, this surely ranks as one of those Harvard Business School
case-study moments. With the tennis industry in the dumps, and the  racket
business dominated by Head, Prince and Wilson, most people  thought Pierre
Babolat was nuts to get into rackets. Now he looks like a  genius. From a
standing start, the company has reached about 16 percent  market share, and it
is closing fast on Head. (Wilson is the leader,  with just under 30 percent of
the market, but it sells to big-box stores  like WalMart, which Babolat refuses
to do.) Since it introduced rackets,  Babolat's revenue has more than tripled,
to $117 million in 2006 sales.  ''They have taken tennis by storm,'' says Mark
Mason, the longtime  proprietor of Mason's Tennis Mart in Manhattan. ''I've
never seen  anything like it.''

If you play tennis, or even just watch the pros,  you've surely noticed the
Babolat phenomenon. The rackets are everywhere  -- at your local courts, and at
this year's United States Open, where a  huge number of players will be using
them.

Babolat will tell you that its  secret sauce is its patented Woofer technology,
which it says keeps the  ball on the strings a split-second longer, imparting a
trampoline-like  rebound. Others note the rackets' ''good looks,'' with their
clean and  distinctive colored lines (depending on the model). But if I were
writing the Harvard case study, I would stress something else: pure dumb  luck.
Sometimes, as the old saying goes, it's better to be lucky than  good.

Do you know about James Blake and Dunlop? Years ago, Blake began  using Dunlop
rackets, eventually signing an endorsement deal with the  company. But in 2004
he had his annus horribilis -- the broken neck, the  death of his father, the
shingles -- and Dunlop dropped him. The  following year, when Blake staged his
remarkable resurgence, he signed  with Prince. The problem was that Blake could
never get comfortable with  his Prince racket. There were even rumors that Blake
was painting Dunlop  rackets to make them look like Prince rackets. Finally,
this past May,  psychology won: he officially returned to Dunlop.

The moral of the story  should be obvious: when a player finds a ''stick'' he
really likes, he is  loath to switch -- even when someone will pay him millions
to do so. For  racket companies, there is another moral: the earlier you can get
your  racket into the hands of young, promising players, the more likely they
are to keep using it as they rise through the ranks.

Each of the four big  racket manufacturers, including Babolat, has a grass-roots
program for  getting promising juniors to use its rackets. Golf and ski
companies  have their own junior programs, but only the elite of the elites get
free equipment; in tennis, the companies compete to distribute rackets  to not
only the top 20 juniors in every country, who usually get them  free, but the
top 100, who can buy rackets at a reduced price.

Why?  Because tennis marketers are convinced that when people watch good
players, they want to try their rackets. ''A player who is ranked 80th
nationally could be the best player in some city or some big tennis  club,''
says Max Brownlee, who started up Babolat's United States  operation in 2000.
And when juniors see higher-ranked juniors using a  racket, they often want to
try it, to see if it raises their game as  well.

Most juniors eventually flame out, but some turn pro -- and thus  create another
marketing opportunity. While companies build ad campaigns  around top players
like Andre Agassi (Head) or Roger Federer (Wilson),  club players also notice
what racket their favorite player is using and  often buy an amateur version of
it. (The pros' rackets are rarely  identical to those sold at retail; pros
usually customize their  rackets.) Which brings us back to Babolat.

Babolat came to the racket  business with a big advantage: it had a lock on the
market for natural  gut strings, which are what most serious players want to
use. Babolat  strings are in such demand that the company has never needed to
offer  endorsement deals and has given them away only in the rarest of
circumstances. (Pete Sampras was one of the few players who received  free
strings.) So when Babolat started its grass-roots program, it had  the lure of
free or reduced-price strings to get juniors to use its  rackets.

And it had luck. In 1999, a year before Babolat came to the  United States and
began signing up juniors, a Babolat executive named  Luca Appino started talking
to a tennis coach named Tarik Benhabiles  about having his 17-year-old player
use Babolat. Appino, who no longer  works for the company, and Benhabiles, who
no longer coaches the player,  were old friends. At the time, the only pro using
Babolat was the  Spaniard Carlos Moya, from Majorca. He was ''a good-looking,
flamboyant  dude,'' in the words of tennis agent Ken Meyerson, but not someone
who  was going to move a lot of product outside Europe.

Benhabiles's player  was an American junior almost no one had heard of, Andy
Roddick. ''I  didn't know much about him,'' concedes Brownlee, who at the time
was  working for Prince. Back then, Roddick didn't have a big reputation; in
1999, he lost in the first round of two of the junior grand slam  tournaments.
Volkl was the only other company willing to give Roddick a  racket, but he chose
Babolat because of his coach's relationship with  Appino.

A year later everything changed. Roddick won three out of the  four boys' majors
and became the No. 1 junior in the world. Other  juniors took notice, especially
of his monster serve. Some actually  phoned Babolat in France, to see if they
too could get ''Andy's racket.''  ''If he had been out there with a
broomstick,'' says Rick Macci, who  coached Roddick between ages 9 and 14, ''I
think people would have wanted  to try a broomstick.''

Over the next three years, Roddick was the hottest  thing in tennis, an
electrifying player with a crowd-pleasing  personality. And -- how blessed can
Babolat be? -- he was American. If you  are going to sell rackets in America,
you need an American star.

Needless  to say, it wasn't long before Babolat was doing something it doesn't
often do: paying Roddick to endorse its rackets. His agent, Meyerson,
negotiated a small six-figure deal in 2000, shortly after Roddick turned  pro,
and then a much larger deal in 2003, right around the time Roddick  won the
United States Open. That deal nets him millions a year. Would  Roddick have
changed rackets had Babolat low-balled him? Probably not.  But the company
decided not to take that risk. A happy endorser is  always better than a grouchy
one.

Eric Babolat was running the company by  then. His father, Pierre, had died in
1998, in a plane crash returning  from the United States Open. Pierre got to see
Carlos Moya win the  French Open in 1998 with a Babolat racket, but he died well
before  Babolat took tennis by storm. ''I regret the most for my father that he
never got to see the success,'' Eric Babolat says. ''He was vindicated  after
his death.''

Roddick is still a hugely important endorser for  Babolat, even as he has
slipped in the rankings and Federer and Rafael  Nadal have come to dominate the
men's tour. He has a signature racket,  called Pure Drive Roddick, which earns
him royalties. When Eric Babolat  decided to get into the highly competitive
tennis shoe business a few  years ago, he quickly got Roddick to agree to wear
the shoes and signed  him up as an endorser. Today, if you go to the Babolat
display in any  tennis store in the United States, you'll see ads for Roddick
and his  racket and shoes.

But you'll also see ads for someone else: Rafael Nadal.  And here you can only
shake your head in wonder. Nadal was missed by the  grass-roots programs of the
big racket makers, yet wound up with  Babolat.

Why? Because he comes from Majorca. His idol is none other than  the original
Babolat man, Carlos Moya. Is it any surprise, then, that  Nadal would use the
same racket as Moya? Not to anyone who markets  tennis rackets.

Today, at age 21, Nadal is one of the great forces in  tennis, the one true
rival to Federer. The pace and spin with which he  hits the ball generate the
same kind of awe as Roddick's service. That  in turn leads juniors -- and lots
of club players -- to the Babolat  Aeropro, which is Nadal's racket. Not long
ago, Babolat locked up Nadal  with a 10-year deal, for a multimillion-dollar sum
that makes him among  the top racket endorsers (obviously Roddick is in the same
category).

Sales of the Babolat Aeropro, Brownlee told me, are 18 months  ahead of
projections. Then he let out a small chuckle and added, ''What  can you say?''

Harvard Business School couldn't have put it better.

Sporting Gear; Small Trailer for Camping

Compact cars save on gasoline, but they also present a storage problem for
families that do a lot of camping. The VersaTrailer is a two-wheel vehicle
designed to solve that problem. The container itself is 60 inches long, 49
inches wide, 10 inches deep and has 36 cubic feet of space. Its overall length,
including the tongue that hitches onto the car, is 102 inches. VersaTrailer,
which carries up to 1,000 pounds of equipment, has an optional plastic cover
that is waterproof and can be locked to protect the contents of the container.
The bed of the trailer tilts down for easy loading. Both end gates also fold
down to accommodate extra-long cargo. The trailer costs $399, the cover $99, and
a hitch, if needed, is $55 installed.  All can be purchased at the Hempstead
Outdoor Store, 236 Front Street, Hempstead, L.I. 11550, (516) 486-0960.

Tennis Racquet With More Power

The Vector, a new tennis racquet introduced by the AMF Head Division for the
more experienced player, has a 12 percent larger hitting area for increased
power. The racquet is 26 3/4 inches long and is constructed of high-strength
7005 extruded aluminum. The Vector has a seven-inch grip, and a longer,
elongated head shape as compared with conventional-size racquets. The
open-throat design of the mid-size Vector is said to give the experienced player
better control without loss of power or feel. The Vector is sold at most pro
shops and sporting goods stores. The suggested retail price is $85, without the
strings.

Gloves for Fishing and Sailing

Two new types are being offered by a Philadelphia concern. The Fisherman Friend
gloves are made of 100-percent cotton, have an extra wide cuff for easy removal
and are washable. They are patterned for flexibility when gripping leader wire,
securing lines or attaching bait. The Hoist 'em Tuff sailing gloves are made of
bone cowhide and are double-layered at the palms to protect against chafe or
rope burn. The fingertips are cut off for better performance of sailing duties,
and the Velcro closure at the wrist insures a tight fit. The medium fishing
gloves cost $11.95 and the large size $13.95, both six pairs to an order. The
sailing gloves, in small, medium, large and extra-large sizes, cost $13.50 a
pair. Mailing charges are not included in the price. Available from Goldberg's
Marine, 202 Market Street, Philadelphia, Pa. 19106, (215) 627-3700.

Plenty of choices for holiday gifts

SECTION: B,B; Pg. 20

LENGTH: 626 words


Phil Primerano and Lisa Noworyta are co-managers of JB's Tennis Shop. JB's array
of tennis merchandise and overall tennis equipment is second to none in Western
New York.

"Each holiday season Lisa and I are always pleased  with the outstanding tennis
merchandise that we see," said Primerano. "I really feel that the different
tennis products that are on the market this year will be especially welcomed by
the tennis playing public."

Some of the outstanding tennis products that are available follow.

Tennis Rackets

· Head Graphite XT Speed: One of the most innovative on the market, the racket
has grommets that allow a player to adjust string patterns to create more
control and spin. All three of the rackets in this series have a great feel and
provide control and power. They sell for $200 apiece.

· Wilson Rackets: The new Federer rackets, especially the Pro Staff  line, are
extremely popular, with great playability and available in three styles ranging
in price from $200-220.

· Babolat Pure Drive Play:  The rise of the popularity of Babolat rackets has
bordered on the miraculous. Presently, it's the best selling racket in the
country.

The next time you play tennis or watch matches on television you should notice
how many players are using a Babolat racket. Babolat has developed a "smart"
racket that has parameters that measure different types of ground strokes using
head speed and spin. Information is fed into your mobile device and recorded.

The racket is especially popular with teaching pros because of its ability to
help with technical lessons. This racket is also a must for the real aficionados
of the game. The racket sells for $400.

Junior Rackets

There are many rackets available for youngsters, ranging from 21 inches for
peewees, 23 inches for ages 5-6, 25 inches for ages 7-8 and 26 inches for those
9-10. There are also higher-end rackets similar to adult rackets, but they have
shorter lengths and smaller grips.

Tennis tip: Be sure to take your child with you when you go to buy them a racket
.

Footwear

Adidas Barricade 5: Adidas is making a big comeback in the tennis shoe industry.
This shoe appears to have the best durability and court feel for the really
serious player. Cost is $99 for both men and women.

Nike Zoom Vapor 9.5 Tour: Although the shoe is a bit pricey at $130, an
ultra-soft midsole and upper allow for incredible comfort and feel.

Prince T-22: Has an ultra-soft midsole that provides great comfort. The price is
$90.

Other ideas

Squash: Due to impressive coaching, junior programs and great support from local
clubs and schools, squash has seen a steady increase in the number of players of
all ages. Dunlop and Head rackets, in addition to shoes and accessories, are all
available at JB's in the price range of $90-170.

Platform Tennis: Another racket sport that is gaining popularity in the WNY
area. The game is played outside during the winter and can be played by players
at different levels. Wilson and Viking paddles sell for $100-170.

Racquetball: LA Fitness has put 3 beautiful racquetball courts in its new
facility on Sheridan Drive. There is great interest in league and recreational
play. Hopefully, they will add some more courts to their other facilities in the
area. Head and E Force are two of the leading brands in WNY. Both companies have
a great new line of rackets and shoes. Rackets sell for $70-220, and shoes sell
for $80-100.

Badminton: It's one of the leading sports in Olympic competition and is easy on
your body. Paddles range from $65 to 105.

Tennis Strings: The holiday season is an excellent time to get your racket
strung. You could also do your friend or relative a big favor by also getting
their rackets strung. Prices range from $19.99-$64.99 (for gut).

Home court rules against squash ace; Johnson suffers only second loss of season

BYLINE: By D.W. Pine Staff writersports; competition; women; ranking;

SECTION: EXTRA; SECTION G; PAGE 07

LENGTH: 410 words


Sometimes there's no place like home, as Marietta's 15-year-old junior squash
sensation Katherine Johnson found out to her chagrin this past weekend.

She's won in Philadelphia, New York City, New Hampshire, Washington, Cincinnati
and virtually every major East Coast city the past three years.

Johnson is a three-time defending National Junior Squash champion who's won more
than 24 consecutive matches and is ranked No. 1 nationally in the under-17 age
group by the United States Squash Racquets Association.

But in the first-ever junior championships in Atlanta - Johnson's back yard,
training center and home court - she lost for just the second time this season.

"It really felt different - there were people I knew there," said Johnson, who
competed in the girls under-17 division in the 1991 Coca- Cola U.S. Junior
Olympic Softball Squash tournament at Atlanta Health and Racquet Club. "It's not
fun to lose, but I know it's going to happen. I just wish it would've happened
at a different tournament.

"It losing brings you back to reality," said Johnson. "It gives me more
incentive."

Johnson, the youngest competitor in her division, won the first two games of the
championship match 10-8 and 9-3 against Blair Clarke of Virginia. She led the
third game 7-1, but then something happened.

"I had a lead, and I just let down," said Johnson, a junior at Walton High who
defeated Clark 3-0 in Philadelphia less than a month ago. "I thought I had it,
and she picked up her game."

She lost the game 10-9 and fell 9-5 and 9-3 in the final two games. But her
setback in Atlanta is overshadowed by her past success and future aspirations.

"I want to attend an Ivy League school - that's about the only place I could
continue to play squash," said Johnson, who grew tired of tennis and switched to
squash four years ago. "I never thought I would carry it this far, but coach Tom
Rumpler told me I could do it if I worked at it. He's supported me from the
start."

Squash, similar to racquetball, features rackets like those used in badminton,
and a hard or soft rubber ball that players can hit against any of the four
enclosed walls. The first player to accumulate nine points (winning by two) wins
a game in softball squash. The first player to 15 wins in hardball. Both formats
feature a best-of-five series.

"She's played a lot of sports," says Rumpler, "but she's found that squash is
the best sport there is."

Tennis is Rinehart's racket | Venice resident's game has grown by leaps and
bounds

BYLINE: MIC HUBER

SECTION: C; FL Sports; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 601 words


TENNIS: COMMENTARY

When it came time to retire, Timm Rinhart figured he would be like the countless
other guys who escaped the north with plans to while away the hours playing golf
in sunny Florida.

But not long after Rinehart, a college administrator who spent the last 15 years
of his career at Temple University, started to settle into retirement in sleepy
Venice a little more than four years ago, he picked up a tennis racket. It was
love at first sight.

"I rediscovered my love for tennis," said Rinehart, who didn't find time for the
game over a lifetime of raising a family and carving out a career.

And over the past four years, not only has Rinehart found many new friends in
the game but he has also discovered a knack for winning, much like he did
Thursday in his 7-5, 7-5 victory over Terry Tetzlaff to reach today's
championship match at the West Coast Super Senior Grand Prix at The Meadows
Racquet Club.

Last week, as the No. 2 seeded player, Rinehart won four matches to capture the
Super Senior tournament at Sarasota's Payne Park. This week he has won three
matches as the tournament's top-seeded player. Next week he will likely be the
player to beat when the senior circuit's next stop gets under way at Palm-Aire
Racquet Club.

Rinehart has been winning so much that people are beginning to spell his first
name correctly.

"I have gotten to know some great guys playing tennis," Rinehart says. "This is
a mecca for senior tennis."

And this is the season for senior tennis, with three weeks' worth of tournaments
in the immediate area and many more throughout Southwest Florida.

It is a circuit for players passionate about the game at an age where many men
are settling into a more sedentary lifestyle.

There's none of that sitting around for players like George McCabe, a former
top-ranked 80-over player in the country. Now approaching 85, McCabe played down
in the 80s this week and dropped just one game in two matches to reach the
semifinals before running into Santiago Benites, the new kid on the block.

"Giving up five years at this age is asking a lot," McCabe said after dropping a
6-0, 6-3 decision to his 79-year-old opponent.

It didn't matter that Benites didn't get to play on his lucky court No. 13 for
the first time in five matches. He was too strong, too young.

And today, in the 80-over championship match, Benites will take on James Curry,
who had to play for more than three hours to outlast Oz Winters, 2-6, 6-3, 6-4.

For McCabe, there is more tennis on the agenda. He will play down in the 80s
next week at Palm-Aire, then probably act his age and play in the 85s in the
following week's tournament in St. Petersburg.

"He just loves to play tennis," said McCabe's wife, Barbara.

And he enjoys the camaraderie, as does the majority of the tight-knit group
where winning and losing isn't nearly as important as getting out in perfect
weather, with the sunshine warming their bones and plenty of old stories to be
told.

"He is an inspiration to us guys in the 70s," said Rinehart about McCabe and his
ability to still play the game at a high level.

Youth is still on the side of Rinehart, who is a youngster in his division at
the age of 69.

The youth may have contributed to Rinehart's ability reach down for a little
extra when he faced a 0-4, 0-30 deficit in the second set. It was a similar to
the run he made after being down 5-1 in the second set in last week's final.

"This might be the year to get a national ranking," Rinehart said. "I think, if
I play enough, my goal is to crack the top 10. That might be a little
ambitious."

In the world of senior tennis, anything is possible.

New author Gayle covers his values

BYLINE: Larry Weisman; Jerry Potter; Ben Brown

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 2C

LENGTH: 611 words


Much of what Shaun Gayle reads during the NFL season involves only X's and O's.
What he writes in the offseason focuses on kids.

The Chicago Bears' veteran safety has a four-book set for kids ages 5-9 on the
market. In Shaun Gayle's Sports Tales, he gently advocates his values -
morality, decency, teamwork and humility.

"The books are for kids, but I want the parents to be part of the equation in
reading the books to the kids and in getting the message," says Gayle, 32, who
holds a degree in education from Ohio State University. "We need to learn how to
deal with one another."

In Home Run Pete, the eponymous hero (very much like Casey At The Bat) gets his
huge ego cut down and learns a few lessons about modesty and sharing. In Jill
and the Hill, a girl who stars in track finds out about caring friends.

"I wanted to make sure I didn't preach to anybody or tell them they're wrong for
not seeing things the way I do," says Gayle, who writes in rhyming couplets. "I
wanted the story to be enjoyable but for the theme to flow."

Patrick Owsley's expressive illustrations help keep the narratives moving.

Published by Victor Books, the series is available in bookstores at $ 4.99 a
book ($ 7.99 with a cassette of Gayle reading).

Promotion tale

The guys at Prince Sports Group saw a magazine photo of Princess Diana holding a
Prince tennis racket in front of her face to discourage photographers. Someone
observed, at poor Prince Charles' expense, that Lady Di had traded her frog for
a real Prince. And suddenly a promotion was born.

Starting this week, the company will trade new Prince Junior rackets - up to 200
of them - for old frogs.

Prince wants kids to send in books and toys, anything connected with frogs. The
stuff will go to Toys for Tots. And the first 200 kids get tennis rackets.
(Limit: two per family.)

Write: Turn Your Frog Into a Prince, c/o Prince Sports Group, 924 Broadway, New
York, N.Y. 10010.

Pony express

Pro football fans in Baltimore have suffered the indignity of seeing the
National Football League version of the Colts sneak away in the dead of night,
then have watched as NFL lawyers challenge the use of the Colts name by the new
Canadian Football League franchise.

So it's easy to understand how they might support today's stunt by Rouse & Co.,
the morning crew on WQSR-FM radio.

The station has ordered a truckload of horse manure to be packaged up and
shipped to NFL Commisioner Paul Tagliabue, whom they've dubbed Paul TagliaPOOH
for the occasion.

Accompanying the packages will be this ditty:

First, you took our team; then, you took our name.

This is all you left us with.

Stick this in your Hall of Fame.

Funny shot

Golfer Kim Williams isn't sure how much she has recovered physically from a
gunshot wound, but she has a healthy humor about the incident.

"I don't mean to make fun," says Williams, "but I think Target Drug Stores might
be a better sponsor for me than Bullet Golf."

Williams, 31, is in Sylvania, Ohio, where she hopes to play in the LPGA's Jamie
Farr Toledo Classic Friday. That will be six days after she was shot in Niles,
Ohio, while standing in the parking lot of a drug store.

Police are questioning a man who was target shooting near the store at the time
Williams was hit.

The bullet hit Williams in the neck and lodged near her collarbone. The doctors
who treated her have decided not to remove the bullet.

"It felt like I'd been hit by a baseball," says Williams. "I thought I'd been
hit by a golf ball. Then I realized I wasn't on a golf course."

Williams feels fortunate to be alive, but "every time I swallow, I feel that
bullet in my throat."

LENGTH: 715 words

DATELINE: ST. PETERSBURG



ST. PETERSBURG - Before this weekend is over, they will have played    more than
200 matches.

     After months of local play, players for 25 USTA Volvo teams will    meet
today, Saturday and Sunday in the Central Regional Championships    at the St.
Petersburg Tennis Center. The teams from Orlando, Lakeland,    Tampa, Sarasota,
Fort Pierce and St. Petersburg-Clearwater range in    skill levels from 3.0 to
5.0, and all are hoping to advance to the    state sectional championships, Aug.
14-16 in Kissimmee.

     This area has produced both men's and women's national championship
teams in the past. And this year, as usual, Pinellas County's District    12
teams are expected to be strong contenders in the regional    competition.

     Leading the list of local teams expected to do well are the men's    5.0
and 4.5 Seminole Lake Racquet Club teams. The St. Petersburg Tennis    Center's
womens 5.0 team has already advanced to state competition by    winning in
league play. There are so few womens 5.0 teams in the    Central region that the
league winner automatically qualifies.

     The surprise team in the District 12 playoff competition is Royal
Racquet Club's womens 4.5 team, which had a 3-5 record in    regular-season
play. Royal surprised everyone by winning both rounds of    the four-team area
playoff competition to advance to this weekend's    tournament.

     The Central Regional Championships tournament, the second of three
regional competitions, is expected to attract more than 250 players.

 Nationwide, the USTA Volvo league attracted more than 100,000 players    this
past spring.

     Final match play at the tennis center, which is located at 650 18th    Ave.
S, will begin Sunday at 2:30. For more information, call 894-4378.





   Players from the Bardmoor/Stearns International Tennis Centre did    well at
the recent national hard court tournaments held at various    sites around the
country.

     In the boys 12s, Tommy Shimada finished ranked No. 5 in the nation,
followed by Wayne Boich at No. 6 and B.J. Stearns - in his first year    in this
age bracket - who finished ranked in the top 16. Also, Boich    and Shimada were
national runners-up in doubles competition. All three    players leave Saturday
for the Boys 12 National Clay Court    Championships in Winston-Salem, N.C.
        In boys 18s, Marc Kudelko finished in the top 16. Amy Mascotti did
the same in girls 14s.

     In Southern Open play, Heather Greene and John J. O'Brien have    reached
the semifinals in the girls and boys 14s competition,    respectively.



   The Largo Recreation and Parks Department has a wide and varied    slate of
tennis activities. There are singles leagues - with a $ 10    entry fee - for
virtually all levels of play;   there is men's doubles    night each Thursday;
women's round-robin doubles every Thursday    morning; mixed doubles nights on
Tuesdays, and wheelchair tennis    practice on Wednesday evenings.

     Also, tennis lessons at the Highland, Southwest Complex in Largo    resumed
earlier this week. Richard Needham is the instructor.

     For more information about Largo programs, contact Mary Lacey at
584-8671, ext. 228.



   Al Sarmiento, tennis director at Paradise Island Golf and Tennis    Club in
Treasure Island, is directing a sanctioned adult tournament    beginning
Saturday. Five divisions for men and three categories for    women are
scheduled. Call 360-6062.



   The St. Pete Junior Championships are July 30-Aug. 2 for    18-and-under
players. Call Sam Vuille at 823-6667 before the July 27    deadline.



   Innisbrook Tennis and Racquetball Center in Tarpon Springs is the    site for
two junior competitions this month. A 16-and-under singles and    doubles
tournament began Tuesday and is followed by a 14-and-under    invitational July
25-27. Call Phillip Green at 937-3124.

   Racquets Mate is a leading racquets stringing and customising stringing
service.  Racquets Mate allows every player of tennis, squash and badminton to
experience and have their racquet strung the same as if they were a
professional.  In 2008 David completed the United States Racquet Stringers
Association Master racquet Technician Course ( USRSA MRT). In 2009 he was part
of the Wimbledon Official Stringing Service and has been since. In 2012 David
was part of the Babolat Official Stringing Service at Roland Garros. David has
also been part of the Babolat UK Stringers Team since 2010.  Why have my racquet
strung if the strings haven't broken?  Over time the stings start to loose
tension and elasticity. When this happens the strings will become "dead" and the
player will have to start applying more effort to get the same outcome as the
strings become less responsive. This is because where the strings have lost
their elasticity, when the ball comes into contact with them they do not have
the energy to "snap" back to their original position and create ball momentum.
For the player to get the same response as they were with fresh strings they
have to apply more effort and force themselves which can lead to thing like arm
and shoulder injuries.  As a rule: the number of times in a week you play on
average is the number of times a year you should have your racquet strung to
keep the strings performing well.

A Slightly Calmer Gasquet Advances

BYLINE: By LEE JENKINS

SECTION: Section 8; Column 1; Sports Desk; TENNIS; Pg. 8

LENGTH: 609 words


Richard Gasquet threw his racket again.

This time, it did not hit a linesman in the eye. This time, it did not draw
blood. This time, it did not result in disqualification.

The 19-year-old Gasquet has found safer places to dispose of his equipment.
Yesterday afternoon, he tossed his racket into the net after losing a point,
then calmly picked it up and came back for a five-set victory over Ivan Ljubicic
in the third round of the United States Open at Armstrong Stadium.

''I feel a lot better,'' said Gasquet, who is seeded 13th. ''I feel like I saw
my progress.''

He hopes New York saw it, too. Last year, Gasquet walked off the court when he
was trailing in a match at the Bronx Challenge. Then he was disqualified from an
Open qualifying match for throwing his racket. That the racket accidentally hit
a linesman and caused blood to trickle down his face did not help Gasquet's
reputation. He went home to France and met with Alain Gonzalez, a family friend
who works with troubled adolescents.

Gasquet was suffering from many symptoms of child celebrity. He was on a
magazine cover at 9, won at Monte Carlo at 15 and was hailed as the next great
French tennis prodigy. But at the start of this year, Gasquet had never won a
match in a Grand Slam event. His tantrums were significantly more celebrated
than his blistering backhand.

Like many tennis-playing teenagers, Gasquet might have just needed some more
time. He beat Roger Federer in Monte Carlo this year, reached the third round at
the French Open and the fourth round at Wimbledon. After his second-round
opponent at the United States Open retired during their match earlier in the
week, Gasquet joked with the French news media that he was supposed to be the
one who quit.

''What happened here last year was not good for me,'' Gasquet said. ''But I now
have more experience and am more mature. I worked a lot after my
disqualification, and I think I learned a lot.''

Gasquet is hardly the first young player to throw his racket, although he may be
among the first to cause real injury. Racket-tossing is a longstanding tradition
among 12-year-olds and professionals alike. Gustavo Kuerten was disqualified
from a Wimbledon doubles match in 1998 when he threw his racket in the direction
of an umpire. Guillermo Coria threw his racket at the French Open in 2003 and
nearly hit a ball girl. Tim Henman did hit a ball girl at Wimbledon in 1995, but
it was with a ball instead of a racket.

Gasquet still has a hard time keeping his racket in his hand and still makes the
unexpected part of his game. When balls carom off the back fence, he routinely
kicks them or bounces them off his head, playing hacky sack in addition to
tennis. Trailing early in yesterday's match, Gasquet irritated Ljubicic by
repeatedly calling for a trainer during changes to massage his sore right elbow.
When Gasquet took command later in the match, he no longer called for the
trainer.

''He's a little weird,'' Ljubicic, seeded 18th, said after his 3-6, 7-6 (6), 6-7
(7), 6-3, 6-2 loss. ''He can play great or he can play horrible. He's spoiled. I
think he'll grow as a person, but right now, he's a kid and he's acting as a
kid.''

Ljubicic had similar comments two years ago for Andy Roddick, whom he accused of
riling the crowd and alienating fellow players. Gasquet has been compared more
often with Rafael Nadal, who was born 15 days earlier and became a force in
tennis much more quickly.

In this year's Open, however, Gasquet is in the fourth round and Nadal is out.

Gasquet would prefer not talk about his racket-chucking any longer. A few more
victories, and the subject will likely be smashed.

Sam's making a racket;
Sport-mad Billings out to rock Aussies

BYLINE: GIDEON BROOKS

SECTION: SPORT; Pg. 52

LENGTH: 647 words


FOR all the promise of his first forays in an England shirt, Sam Billings has
accepted he is unlikely to play a part in the Ashes.

But the young Kent wicketkeeper-batsman is still hoping to play a significant
role this week, first by keeping England's momentum going in the T20 against New
Zealand at Old Trafford tonight, then putting a spoke in the Aussies' wheels at
Canterbury.

Billings will play in three different formats this week, twice for England and
once for Kent. Following the 50-over victory in Durham, he plays in Manchester
in the solitary T20 against the Kiwis, before donning the whites against Michael
Clarke's Australians in the first match of their tour, starting on Thursday.

If anyone can manage the transitions in pace and subtlety, it is Billings, whose
sporting skills stretch from cricket to football, tennis, rackets, squash and
golf.

The Kent player was once offered a trial with Tottenham after scoring a
hat-trick against them for his club Corinthians FC, and his skills at rackets -
a game he describes as "a bit mad, like squash on speed" or "posh squash", where
the ball travels at speeds north of 160mph - are considerable.

Rugby, golf and countystandard tennis complete the sporting CV, but it will be
with bat in hand that he can most influence the relative momentums of England
and Australia.

And he is hoping that, like Alastair Cook, who jolted the Australians in 2005
with a double century at Chelmsford, he can knock Clarke's bowlers out of their
stride at the St Lawrence Ground.

"I will be playing there if selected," said Billings. "The boys have been going
well in the T20 stuff, so hopefully that will be a really good test and a great
opportunity for me personally and for the team.

"First, we have to turn over New Zealand here, which will help keep the momentum
going for England ahead of the Ashes."

Billings is in the vanguard of England's one-day revolution; a young, highly
skilled T20 operator. Like Jos Buttler and Jonny Bairstow, his multisports skill
set is impressive and contributes to the handeye co-ordination required.

"It certainly helps with the slogging - especially the rackets," said Billings.
"A lot of good cricketers have historically been good at rackets. Sam Northeast
at Kent has been walloping it everywhere recently and he's a national rackets
champion.

"I dabbled a bit in football back in the day and scored a hat-trick against
Tottenham Academy. It got me a trial but I didn't go because I was on tour in
Barbados with the South of England Under-14s.

"I enjoy all kinds of sports. It's good to take different aspects into your
cricket. Playing other sports also takes a bit of pressure off your cricket
because it was always going to be the only one I would play to a professional
level."

Billings' first few steps in international cricket have been suitably assured
and his partnership with Bairstow in Durham, coming to the wicket at 45-5 and
leaving at 125-6, having smashed 41 in 30 balls, was his best moment so far.

"The ODI series was a great start and it is very much as we mean to go on, but
it is only a start. We want to take this team further forward," he said.

"Hopefully that series has generated a bit of interest around the country and
got people behind the England team going into the Ashes. That is surely a good
thing."

With little relevant context in which to place this one-off match, England may
be keen to have a look at Essex left-armer Reece Topley, a specialist T20 pick,
with Mark Wood likely to be rested if they go that way.

Hampshire's James Vince could be the unlucky man to miss out.

ENGLAND (probable): Roy, Hales, Root, Morgan (capt), Stokes, Bairstow, Billings,
Rashid, Willey, Topley, Finn.

NEW ZEALAND (probable): Guptill, B McCullum (capt), Williamson, Taylor, Elliott,

Assemblyman Jared Huffman easily defeats Roberts

BYLINE: By Richard Halstead Marin Independent Journal

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 422 words


Assemblyman Jared Huffman was sailing to an easy win Tuesday night over his
Republican opponent, Tiburon investment adviser Dan Roberts, in the race for the
new 2nd Congressional District seat.

With 35 percent of the vote counted, Huffman had a 70 percent share and Roberts
had 30 percent.

Huffman, 48, will go to Washington, D.C., after serving the maximum allowable
three terms in the state Assembly. Before joining the Assembly he worked as an
attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council and served 12 years on the
board of the Marin Municipal Water District.

Huffman will take the place of Rep. Lynn Woolsey, D-Petaluma, 75, who is
retiring after serving 20 years as Marin County's representative in Congress.

Huffman will be leaving the California Legislature, where Democrats rule, and
joining the Republican-dominated House of Representatives.

"That's going to be a change, and I'm going to have to find a way to be
effective with the hand that is dealt me," Huffman said.

"I will reach out," he said. "I will try to build some relationships and make
some friends across party lines even as I work in the years ahead to try to
change the majority to Democratic."

Huffman said he was encouraged Tuesday by President Obama's victory and the
Democrats' ability to maintain control of the Senate.

"I think there is a statement there that the public has seen enough of this
extreme ideology above everything else," Huffman said.

He added, "We're really struggling right now with the question of whether our
government is entirely about ideology or whether it is about problem solving.
I'm going to do my best to be on the problem-solving side."

Huffman said his top priorities will be working to get Americans back to work by
pushing for increased investment in critical infrastructure, education, clean
energy solutions and bolder action to end the mortgage foreclosure crisis.

Roberts had to cope with a preponderance of registered Democrats in the district
and a dearth of campaign funds. Huffman collected more than $1.3 million in
campaign contributions compared with about $44,000 for Roberts. Roberts
attempted to compensate for his lack of financial backing by contributing
$210,000 of his own money to his campaign.

Roberts said he had no regrets, however.

"I think democracy and voice are very imporant," Roberts said. "I just didn't
attract enough of the independents or Reagan conservative Democrats, and Jared
ran a strictly on the message campaign, and it resonated."

OBSERVER;
'J'Accuse' For Pete Rose

BYLINE: By Russell Baker

SECTION: Section 1; Page 23, Column 6; Editorial Desk

LENGTH: 743 words


Baseball's rules against gambling seem quaint in a country where government
muscle has taken over the gambling rackets from the Mafia.

Pete Rose, the Cincinnati nonpareil whose baseball career is now threatened with
ruin because of these rules, has not so far indicted all society for hypocrisy
in this business, preferring to place his destiny in the briefcases of lawyers,
a breed not given to passionate articulations about the moral decline of great
nations.

Being lawyers, they are reducing this great issue to a quarrel about the
distinction between a tittle and a jot. What a pity. It would be lovely to see
Rose rise up with the fury of a Zola and deliver a Cincinnati ''J'accuse''
against a terrible conspiracy to corrupt the people of the great Republic.

Yes, he might concede, involvement with gamblers was certainly a despicable
offense in 1919, the year that begat baseball's hatred of gambling.

Gambling was then a criminal industry operated by bad people. For ballplayers to
put themselves at the mercy of these gangsters, as the Chicago White Sox did
during the 1919 World Series, was unforgivable and criminal.

That their employer was famous for cheapness and treated his players like
sweatshop labor in no way diminished their offense.

American views of morality have changed mightily since then, however, and
particularly the view of gambling. Gambling, a vileness of racketeers in 1919,
is now as American as a Treasury deficit.

Many states, seeing it as a way to fill their treasury vaults, have taken over
the old numbers racket from the Mafia and operate highly publicized lotteries.

These schemes bilk the suckers -or the citizens, as governmental Nice Nellies
prefer to call them - with teasing promises of multimillion-dollar prizes.

The most innocent babe living in a state running one of these rackets is exposed
daily to government adver-tising aimed at making gamblers of the entire
population.

Tobacco companies cannot advertise cigarettes because forces of uplift have
determined, probably rightly, that cigarettes are bad for you and that the power
of television should not be exerted against youthful or dumb or innocent people
to addict them to the weed.

Nobody seems to mind, though, that governments use television to hook them on
gambling.

Government's love affair with gambling is not limited to passionate promotion of
the numbers racket. In New York, with its OTB horse-betting parlors, we have the
state taking over the horse-betting racket from your old neighborhood bookie and
his Mafia backers.

So New York kids also grow up marinated in OTB commercials which spread the
gospel that playing the ponies is a good, healthy and possibly enriching thing
to do.

How about those commercials for the casinos down in Atlantic City? Here we have
one of the East Coast's most hifalutin, Republican, sober-side states, New
Jersey, endorsing casino gambling as good public policy.

And flooding television screens with commercials preaching the good, clean
seaside fun of gambling in most of its forms.

Shall we move on to Las Vegas, Reno, the entire state of Nevada, a state where
gambling is not just a delightful source of revenue but also an honored,
traditional way of life?

Since 1919 there has been a complete reversal of the national attitude toward
gambling. Once immoral, sinful, criminal, it now enjoys moral sanctity bestowed
by its power to raise government revenues.

There is big money in gambling. Why should government let crooks collect it when
government can grab the lion's share by declaring old-fashioned rackets to be
new-fangled, perfectly legal, revenue-enhancing, public-policy programs?

Since about the time baseball began abandoning its traditional towns and moving
around the country in search of bigger and bigger bucks, it has become
increasingly evident that in America nothing is more important than money.
Nothing.

Government people always knew the gambling passion could be a sweet source of
revenue, but until after World War II some moral delicacy in the electorate
restrained the politicians' urge to legalize it.

Once we all concurred that there was nothing more important than money,
absolutely nothing, our leaders helped us put 1919 with its musty old moral
considerations out of mind.

The decay is now so advanced that governments are trying to make gambling
addicts of us all. Yet baseball's moralists profess shock about Pete Rose. What
hypocrisy. What rot.

Racket spots are prime real estate

BYLINE: Dick Evans

SECTION: SECTION D; Local Notebook; Pg. 6D

LENGTH: 566  words


The Los Angeles Times ran an interesting story about the rise and fall of tennis
popularity in Southern California, which may have similar ramifications in many
parts of the country. The story pointed out that "some 36 million Americans had
rackets in their hands" and court time was so cherished that the Lindborg
Racquet Club charged $1,200 a member way back in the late 1970s. As property
value shot up, tennis popularity slipped down and so the Lindborg Racket Club
became 10 times as valuable as the original investment and was sold to a church
group for $5.2 million. In Florida, recreation sports like bowling, tennis and
golf occupy land that is becoming increasing valuable with every passing month.
So it's no surprise to discover that tennis property in Volusia County is being
coveted by developers. The News-Journal ran a Jan. 23 story about the soaring
land development in Palm Coast that is having repercussions on the Palm Coast
Players Club, which opened 23 years ago on a beautiful parcel of land near the
Intracoastal Waterway. And stories are filtering out at Pelican Bay about the
Country Club leaders possibly selling the tennis property (located about a mile
away) and building four new clay courts on the actual site of the Pelican Bay
Country Club's clubhouse. Doug Booth, executive director of USTA Florida and a
man who keeps his finger on the tennis pulse across the country, was not
surprised when he read the L.A. Times story. "I think that sports properties are
becoming more valuable, especially in the Sunbelt states," said Booth. "And it's
not just happening to privately owned tennis facilities. "You can't stop supply
and demand and if you have a piece of property that is more valuable for homes,
condos or businesses then we have to deal with that reality." But he found a ray
of sunshine in the property dilemma, pointing out that the Palm Coast tennis
leaders took their playing plight to civic leaders and the City Council agreed
to spend $1 million on a new public owned 10-court tennis complex that is
scheduled to open this fall on Royal Palms and Belle Terre parkways. "The tennis
group really worked hard with the city leadership on this tennis proposal and
should be applauded," Booth said. Rightfully so, Booth does not think that
community owned tennis facilities should be expected to turn a profit any more
than public playgrounds, parks, boat ramps, swimming pools, beaches, golf clubs
or basketball courts should beexpected to turn a profit. They all are built
primarily for the pleasure of the taxpayers. GVTL QUESTION: 3 VS. 4? Last year
the Greater Volusia Tennis League voted to reduce the number of teams necessary
for a league match from four to three. That new format gave smaller clubs a
fairer playing field and also reduced the number of forfeited matches each week.
Now the GVTL is revisting the decision, probably because the larger and stronger
teams have more player who are eager to play each week. Executive Director Jean
Wilkes says the GVTL Format Committee wants to find out how the membership feels
about the new three team format vs. the old four team format system. If you are
a GVTL member, you should let your feelings known by going to the Internet and
vote on the GVTL webpage, which is located at www@gvtl.net The deadline for
voting is Monday Feb. 13 and you only can vote once even if you play on two or
three teams.

South-county clubs win in USA League playoffs

BYLINE: NANCY MORGAN

SECTION: NEIGHBORHOOD TIMES; TENNIS; Pg. 26

LENGTH: 867 words



The three-week playoff series to determine local winners in USA League Tennis
began last weekend. Winners advance to regional play next month with state
championship berths on the line. State winners continue on to national play in
the fall.

Patti Johnston credits the third-set tiebreak win by the No. 1 doubles team of
Jean Krause and Sonia Raymond as the pivotal victory for the Racquet Club's 4.0
team against East Lake Woodlands. Undefeated Linda Miller also earned a point in
No. 1 singles for the Racquet Club, as did Irene Haggar and Carol Nelson in No.
3 doubles.

"We got a little bit lucky," said Johnston, the captain. "East Lake has a really
steady doubles team that was unbeaten and I tried to match up with them in No.
2. I played with Chris Agee and hoped with my chip and Chris' slice we'd give
them trouble. It was close, but they won."

The Racquet Club now faces the Treasure Island Tennis and Yacht Club squad,
which beat the Vinoy in its first playoff match, on Saturday.

"We played them pretty much straight up," said Ann Worthington, captain of the
Treasure Island team of its lineup with the Vinoy. "It was close, but I think a
key match for us was our win in No. 3 by Turtle Marshall and Lynn Klein."

Also winning for Treasure Island were Pat Kelly in No. 2 singles and Susan Hobbs
and Patti Prestera in No. 2 doubles. The Vinoy's wins came from Diane Gabay in
No. 1 singles and Karen Howley and Penny Robbins in a third-set tiebreak in No.
1 doubles.

In other women's playoff action, Feather Sound Country Club and East Lake
Woodlands won in the 3.0 division, as did Feather Sound and East Lake in the
3.5.

The Vinoy's 3.5 men's team squeaked past East Lake in its first match with
singles wins from Terry Brett in No. 1 and Don Mathias in No. 2, and a doubles
win from Don Wheeler and Sie Kamide in No. 2.

"I think we were really lucky," said Norm Ott, the Vinoy's captain. "We knew it
would be tough - East Lake was unbeaten in its division - and it was."

Also in the men's 3.5, the Racquet Club defeated wild-card team Dunedin 4-1.

In men's 4.0 competition, Seminole blanked Countryside 5-0 and the Racquet Club
beat Shipwatch 4-1. The Treasure Island Recreation 4.5 squad blanked McMullen
5-0 and Royal Racquet Club defeated the Racquet Club 3-2.

The second round of playoffs is Saturday, with finals June 17.

EAST LAKE RESULTS: More than 250 players supported last month's 10th annual
Morton Plant Mease Hospital Charity Tennis Tournament at East Lake Woodlands in
Palm Harbor. The three-day doubles competition was a benefit for the Powell
Pavilion for Cancer Research and Services.

Yuka Tanaka and Mayo Fukata captured the women's open division while Ann
Worthington and Susan Hobbs won the 4.0, Maureen Sternberg and Debbie McGinley
the 3.5, and Ginger Pfeiffer and Kathleen Annichiarico the 3.0.

Tanak teamed with Jeff McQuinn to win the mixed open title, Diana Gabay and Wimm
Brown won the 4.0, Jeanette and Steve Squitiro the 3.5, abd Anna Maria and
Vincent Addonisio the 3.0.

McQuinn paired with Jim Curran to win the men's 4.0 doubles title, and Squitiro
teamed with Tom Frank to win in 3.5. Bob Dickson and Howard Raphan won the 3.0,
Kevin Bachmann and John Young the 4.5, and Curtis Ingram and Kevin Manning the
men's open.

NET SHOTS: Bugsy Bauer won her first national tournament this month in Peachtree
City, Ga. The girls 14-and-under fifth seed lost no sets in four matches, and in
the final of the Peach State Junior Tennis Classic she defeated No. 4 Melissa
Mang of Louisiana 6-3, 6-3.

Also competing were Kelly Nelson, who reached the girls 16s quarterfinal round,
and Rachel Silverberg, who won the girls 12s consolation. Courtney and Keilly
Ulery also were in the girls 12s.

Diana Fodor won the girls 18s title in last month's End of School Classic held
at East Lake Woodlands. Also winning were Katherine Waldthausen (14s), Morgan
Frank (12s), Michael Tarkowski (18s) and Tim Shadrick (16s).

Consolation winners included Tiffanie Kalvoda (18s), Danielle Epstein (14s),
Carl Fenzl (18s), Adel Nasser (16s), Austin Marr (14s) and Creighton Blanchard
(12s).

JUNIOR DESIGNATED: Alexandria Liles won five matches, all in straight sets, to
successfully defend her top seeding in the 18s division of the Gulfstream
Designated at the Delray Beach Tennis Center last month.

Unseeded Tiffanie Kalvoda won four matches in the girls 18s consolation. in the
girls 16s, No. 6 seed Jennifer Dent won three matches in the feed-in
consolation, as did R.J. Murray in boys 18s.

COMING UP: Royal Racquet Club is offering a Fun Night this Friday for juniors of
all levels between the ages of 6 and 16. A $ 5 fee includes match play,
rallyball, games, target tennis, prizes and pizza from 6 to 8:30. Call the club

SCOUTING;
Borg Sees Mayor, Is Doin' Just Fine

BYLINE: By Thomas Rogers

SECTION: Section 1; Page 45, Column 1; Sports Desk

LENGTH: 289 words


Bjorn Borg was wielding a tennis racquet as he stepped out of a pearl gray
stretch limousine at City Hall yesterday, but the 27-year-old former champion
was there to give his racquet away, not to resume the career he ended a year
ago.

''I am very happy not playing on the tour,'' said Borg, who has played only
occasional exhibitions since announcing his retirement 14 months ago. ''It had
stopped being fun. I play about four to six hours a week now, with my wife or
with friends, and that is enough to keep me happy.''

Borg and his sometimes doubles partner, Vitas Gerulaitis, were welcomed by Mayor
Koch and 30 schoolchildren from P.S. 75 in Manhattan, who received free racquets
and tips on play. The idea was to promote a charity match April 12, when Borg,
Gerulaitis, John McEnroe and others will play in the ballroom of the Sheraton
Centre Hotel to benefit the Vitas Gerulaitis Youth Foundation. The Foundation,
established in 1977, sponsored clinics for 30,000 children last year and gave
away 12,000 racquets.

''It's not just for underprivileged kids,'' Gerulaitis said. ''A kid could drive
up in a limousine and we'd take him. The idea is to introduce kids to tennis,
because it's a lifetime sport and a great way to meet people and make
contacts.'' Borg, who will play exhibition matches in Phoenix on Sunday, in

of his time at his home in Monte Carlo.

He said he plans to play in a Grand Prix tournament in Stuttgart, West Germany,
next July. ''You must understand,'' he added, ''I love tennis. I want to play
more exhibitions and get into better shape. But not the rest of it, the tour.
I'm very happy with what I'm doing.''

WORLD

GAME WON, PORSCHE LOST

The home of goalkeeper Pepe Reina was burgled as he helped Liverpool reach the
Champions League final on penalties, Merseyside Police said on Wednesday. The
24-year-old Spanish international, who saved two spot kicks in the semifinal
shootout against Chelsea, had a number of items stolen from his home in Woolton,
Liverpool. The player's Porsche Cayenne was taken and found burnt out. A Bang &
Olufsen entertainment system, paperwork and jewelry were also taken. Merseyside
Police were called and said the burglary happened while Reina was performing
heroics at a noisy Anfield. It is the latest footballer's home to be targeted by
thieves in the city. Reina's club teammates Jerzy Dudek, Daniel Agger, Peter
Crouch and Florent Sinama-Pongolle, as well as Everton's Andy Van der Meyde,
were all burgled last year.

Lendl racket-less

Former world No. 1 Ivan Lendl revealed on Wednesday he does not have a single
racket left from his playing career. The American of Czech origin told German
magazine Stern he has given away all of the rackets from a glittering career
which saw him win $21 million and 94 ATP tour titles. "I do not have any tennis
racket left," said the 47-year-old, who retired in 1994. "I gave them all away.
When I want to play, I have to borrow one."

Kenyans snub awards

Kenya's top marathon runners, led by three-time Boston marathon champion Robert
Cheruiyot, on Wednesday snubbed a government award ceremony in reaction to a
statement by the country's sports minister over their earnings. Sports Minister
Maina Kamanda had said the runners, who have dominated the big city marathon
races in the past month, did not deserve to be given more money by the
government but only the recognition considering they were already winning bigger
prize money overseas. "Even if the government wishes not to recognize us, we can
as well refuse to represent the country in the Olympics and the Commonwealth
Games," Cheruiyot told reporters at another award presentation ceremony on
Tuesday. "Other countries are doing it and I don't know why Kenya is an
exception," he said.

HOLEY MOLEY

Jacqueline Gagne has been a Tiger on the golf course in recent months. The
Rancho Mirage, Calif., resident has reported eight hole-in-ones between Jan. 23
and April 24. "It's almost like we have a ladies event now and you expect
someone to come in and say Jackie had a hole in one and you'd just go, 'Which
hole?' " Robert Barnes, director of golf at the Mission Hills Country Club, told
the Desert Sun. Gagne, 46, took up golf in earnest in 2003. She's now known
around the course as the hole-in-one lady. Gagne reported her first seven aces
in about 65 rounds. Mike McJilton, a professor in the College of the Desert's
math department, said the odds on that were 113,527,276,681,000,000-to-1.

THEY SAID IT

From Chris Foster of the L.A. Times: "When the New York Rangers and Buffalo
Sabres went into overtime Saturday, NBC was forced to postpone the documentary
Barbaro: A Nation's Horse. So now it can officially be said: the NHL is beating
a dead horse.

TAKE A SHOT AT TENNIS;
BLOCK PARTY AT SCHENLEY COURTS INVITES PEOPLE TO PICK UP A RACKET

BYLINE: Jack Kelly, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette

SECTION: HEALTH WEDNESDAY; Pg. G-2

LENGTH: 512 words


If you are a tennis player, or would like to be one, the U.S. Tennis Association
and Pittsburgh's Parks and Recreation department want you to come to a party.

The USTA and Citiparks will hold a "tennis block party" from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m.
Saturday at the Schenley Park tennis center.

Admission is free. There will be prizes, refreshments, games and expert
instruction for all who attend.

Those interested in attending the party need bring only themselves. Rackets and
tennis balls will be provided.

"Tennis is fun," said Bob Ruzanic, 69, the representative for the Allegheny
Mountain District of the USTA, which consists of 26 western Pennsylvania
counties and the four counties in the panhandle of West Virginia. "We want to
remind people of how much fun it can be."

The 10 members of the Allegheny Mountain District's board will be among the
instructors for Saturday's party. They'll be joined by the tennis staff of the
Pittsburgh Parks & Recreation Department, four board members from the USTA's
Middle States section (Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware and the West Virginia
panhandle), and some pros from area clubs.

* For small children who've never played tennis before, one court will be
divided into "family fun zones," where kids will bat a transition ball over
reduced-size nets.

A transition ball is a foam ball a little larger than a regular tennis ball.

Transition balls make the game more fun for novices who tend to spend more of
their time chasing missed balls than in playing the game.

"They bounce just like a tennis ball, but they don't roll nearly as far," Mr.
Ruzanic said. "Playing with one raises your level of ability at least three
levels."

* For older children, there will be "Tennis 101," where instructors will teach
the basics of how to hold and swing the racket, serving and volleying.

* On at least one court, instructors will put those who wish to try it through a
cardio tennis workout.

Cardio tennis, developed by the USTA and only recently being introduced in area
clubs, is "a basic physical workout using a tennis racket," Mr. Ruzanic said.

* There will be a prize court, where participants can win tennis shirts, hats,
shorts, or other prizes, if they can strike them with a ground stroke from the
base line or a volley from the net.

* Another court will be set up as a speed gun court, where players can measure
the speed of their serves.

Most of the courts at the Schenley Park Center will be demonstration courts,
where players can try out the latest rackets while volleying with, and getting
pointers from, the pros.

For the really skilled, there will be a king-of-the-hill "champions of the
court" competition in which a competitor can remain on the court until bested by
a challenger in abbreviated tennis matches.

"We're going to adapt the games to the number of people who come," Mr. Ruzanic
said. "We don't want to have people standing around."

The party Saturday is one of more than 100 tennis block parties the USTA will
sponsor around the country this summer.

"We want people to come to enjoy the lifelong benefits of tennis," Mr. Ruzanic
said.

SIX FORMER PROSECUTORS CALL MISS HOLTZMAN UNSUITABLE

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ

SECTION: Section B; Page 1, Column 5; Metropolitan Desk

LENGTH: 891 words


Six former local prosecutors, including the city's Fire Commissioner and Mayor
Koch's coordinator for criminal justice, described former Representative
Elizabeth Holtzman yesterday as unsuited for the post of Brooklyn District
Attorney, for which she is seeking the Democratic nomination in the primary
Sept. 10.

Speaking for the six, Fire Commissioner Charles J. Hynes said Miss Holtzman ''is
the one who has the potential to politicize the office.''

''I feel she will feel some obligation to the Kings County Democratic Coalition,
which is backing her,'' he said at a news conference at the St. Moritz Hotel in
Manhattan with Miss Holtzman's opponent, Norman J. Rosen, and the incumbent
District Attorney, Eugene Gold.

Mr. Hynes said that the prosecutors had taken sides in the race because of a
statement by Miss Holtzman that she would ''curb the influence of political
clubhouses'' and that under her the office would ''commit itself to a
nonpolitical, merit-based hiring and promotion policy.'' He called it ''a bad
rap'' on the Brooklyn District Attorney's office.

Miss Holtzman Responds

Miss Holtzman said in a telephone interview yesterday that she had been
''talking in general terms - not particularly - about the Brooklyn District
Attorney's office.''

She dismissed Mr. Hynes and another of the six former prosecutors, John J.
Keenan, now the chairman of the Offtrack Betting Corporation, as being ''cronies
of Mr. Gold.''

''They used to work in that office,'' she said.  Mr. Hynes was head of the
Rackets Bureau in Brooklyn from 1970 to 1973, and was first assistant to Mr.
Gold for two years before leaving in 1975. Mayor Koch's criminal-justice
coordinator, Robert G. M. Keating, was Mr. Gold's chief assistant from 1977 to
1980. Both men joined the Brooklyn office in 1969 when Mr. Gold became District
Attorney.

Mr. Keenan, a former chief assistant district attorney in New York County, said
that ''the office of the District Attorney should be manned by a human who is a
professional prosecutor and not a politician constantly seeking higher office.''


Others Backing Rosen

The three other prosecutors at yesterday's endorsement of Mr. Rosen were Carl
Bronstein, a former chief of the Rackets Bureau in the Bronx; Robert Hill
Schwartz, a former deputy chief of the Rackets Bureau in the Bronx, and Michael
Armstrong, the former District Attorney of Queens County.

Mayor Koch said yesterday that he was ''neutral at this moment'' in the
campaign. He made appearances with both candidates at Brighton Beach on the same
day last week.

Meanwhile, Miss Holtzman released a list of 51 former and current prosecutors
who have endorsed her. They include a former United States Attorney General,
Benjamin Civiletti; the current New York State Attorney General, Robert Abrams;
the Watergate counsel, Samuel Dash, and the Watergate prosecutor, Richard
Ben-Veniste.

''I was quite frankly distressed that she implied that the office had been a
fiefdom of the political machine in Brooklyn,'' Mr. Hynes said.

He said that he, Mr. Keating and 25 other assistant district attorneys had
joined the office after replying to an advertisement placed by Mr. Gold in The
New York Law Journal.

Letter to Gold Is Released

The Rosen campaign yesterday released a letter from Miss Holtzman addressed to
Mr. Gold on July 27, in which she wrote that she wanted to ''clarify a
misunderstanding which may have arisen following the announcement of my
candidacy.'' Miss Holtzman wrote that ''I indicated that I would use the
principle of merit selection in the hiring of District Attorneys. When
specifically questioned as to any critique I might want to offer regarding
current hiring practices in the Brooklyn District Attorney's office, I
specifically declined to offer any comment, explaining that I had no firsthand
factual information regarding procedures in use at this time.'' Miss Holtzman
wrote an accompanying note to Mr. Gold saying that he should feel free to
release the letter and that she would be happy to do so herself.

Mr. Gold said at yesterday's news conference: ''She now says that when she was
asked about the hiring practices, that she didn't know.  That is kind of
incredible.''

Miss Holtzman reiterated her contention that Mr. Rosen, who is Mr.  Gold's
executive assistant, was the ''candidate of the Brooklyn machine.''

''Norman Rosen is Meade Esposito's boy in this race,'' she said.  Mr. Rosen has
been endorsed and is being actively assisted in his campaign by the Brooklyn
party chairman, Meade H. Esposito.

Mr. Rosen said yesterday that he had been a captain in the 41st Assembly
District's Democratic Club before joining the District Attorney's office in
1969, but that he had ''never been a member of a political organization while at
the District Attorney's office.''

Mr. Rosen's campaign staff failed to file a financial report required by the
City Board of Elections on Monday. Mr. Rosen said he did not know that the staff
had not filed it, and added that he did not know why.

ENTRIES are invited for the 2011 Rochdale Observer Men's Bowls Tournament which
will again be supported by Hughes Gas Wisely.

If a preliminary round is needed it will be on Friday 27 May. The first round
(64 players) is on Friday 17 June and second round on 1 July.

The third round and quarter-finals will both be played on Friday 15 July, with
the semi-finals, final, and juniors' final on Saturday 23 July.

Times for all rounds down to finals day will be 6.30 to 7pm for practice, 7pm
start, 7.30pm strike-out. Closing date for entries will be Friday 13 May, and
the opening draw/draws will be made the following Sunday.

The competition is open to all bowlers affiliated to a recognised bowling club
situated within the circulation areas of the Rochdale Observer, Heywood
Advertiser and Middleton Guardian, plus those who play for a recognised club in
a league within those areas whose club might be outside the areas.

The entry fee is  £5 per bowler, and ALL entries must go to Tim Rothwell, 17
Shawclough Way, Rochdale, OL12, 7HF. Cheques should be made payable to the
Central Lancashire Mens Bowling League.   WOOD Cup holders Milnrow get their
season under way tomorrow with a friendly at Lancashire League club Enfield. The
match, which will be 40 overs per side starts at 12.30pm.   TABLE TENNIS: Alpha
Whitworth B reached the Mixed Team Handicap Final after a thrilling victory
against their A team club colleagues. All the B team players scored consistently
well in the level doubles and only just missed out on taking the last game. Gary
Pollock and Kerrie Lawler began the mixed games with a 21-20 win for the B team
which they followed with another 11 points in the second game. John Nuttall and
Janet Beardmore then put the A team back on track with 21-8 and 21-11 wins only
for the next two games to be shared. With the A team now unable to score maximum
points, the B team kept up their high scoring. Their three game wins proved
vital to the result, as only 23 points separated the teams at the finish. In
last Saturday's final against Lancs Racquets, Alpha started nervously and found
it hard to collect points. Conversely, Racquets played with confidence, keeping
their opponents scores low. The exception was the 13 points won by Gary Pollock
and Martin Wolfenden in the first men's game. Ve Nutter and Joyce Ogden took 14
points in their ladies games but Racquets ended the level doubles well ahead.
With the momentum firmly in Racquets' favour, Alpha struggled to get any rhythm
into their play but David Columbine and Ve Nutter gave their team hope with 10
points in the second mixed game. Thereafter, Racquets tightened their grip on
proceedings by not conceding more than seven points in any of the last six
games. Despite the handicap added to Alpha's tally, Racquets took the trophy by
47 points. Mixed Team Handicap semi-final: Alpha Whitworth A 366 Alpha Whitworth

GRAPHIC: Rochdale Sacred Heart 5 Pennington 2 A HAT-TRICK from ex-Rochdale star
Mark Stuart gave Rochdale Sacred Heart victory over Pennington F.C in a
Manchester league game on Tuesday at Fox Park. Pennington put Hearts on the back
foot early on and it was no surprise when they took an early lead. This seemed
to wake Hearts up and they equalised when Salford pressurised the keeper into a
mistake that left him with a nice tap in to equalise. Soon after that debutant
Stuart nodded in number two after fine work from Thompson and Salford. Stuart
and Thompson both missed easy chances before the break to all but wrap the game
up for Hearts. In the second half, the next goal was always going to be
important and Stuart duly obliged for Hearts with a neat finish from the edge of
the box. In one-way traffic after that skipper Ben Fielding's header made it 4-1
before Stuart celebrated his hat-trick after good work from the impressive Mikey
Aston. Pennington grabbed a late consolation. Hearts entertain Chapel Town on
Saturday at Fox Park with a 2pm ko.

York Twp. blast athletic center to get new home: It is expected to acquire
Yorktowne Racquet, Fitness and Sports Complex.

BYLINE: Jessica Milcetich, York Daily Record, Pa.

SECTION: BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS

LENGTH: 387 words


May 22--By the end of the month, Heritage Hills Golf Resort and Conference
Center and the Blast are expected to acquire Yorktowne Racquet, Fitness and
Sports Complex, said Matt DeRose, a general partner at Heritage Hills.

The operation will be called The Blast at Heritage Hills, and be housed in
Yorktowne's East Prospect Road facility in York Township.

All the sporting events previously offered at the Blast will continue, said
Renny Picchini, co-owner of the Blast. This includes leagues in soccer,
basketball, lacrosse, field hockey, volleyball and the Kidz Blast.

The old Blast facility on Grumbacher Road in Manchester Township closed after
the winter session ended in March to prepare for the move to the new facility.

"We're making every effort to be open for Blast operations by the fall,"
Picchini said.

In order for that to happen, the facility will undergo significant renovations
and upgrades, Picchini said.

The racquet and fitness center currently offers a variety of sports and exercise
equipment, including weights, cardio equipment, group fitness classes,
volleyball and tennis courts.

"All the activities currently at the racquet and fitness center are planned at
this point to remain," DeRose said. "Some will be at lesser capacity in order to
make room."

The number of tennis courts will be reduced, DeRose said, but he didn't know how
many, or if the change would be permanent.

The plans for the new look of the facility are not yet finalized, Picchini

said. DeRose added the new business plan would be completed by the end of the
summer.

Yorktowne Racquet and Fitness owner Joe Glitz declined comment.

AT A GLANCE

Heritage Hills Golf Resort and Conference Center partnered with the Blast to
acquire Yorktowne Racquet, Fitness and Sports Complex.

Blast sports will move to the Yorktowne facility with a scheduled fall opening.

Current Yorktowne programs are expected to continue.

When burnout creeps in, give it a rest

BYLINE: By Charlie Garfinkel

Chris Sadkowski is one of the finest all around racket stars ever produced in
Western New York. He started playing tennis at age 5 and was already playing
tournaments at 8. He went on to star in tennis and squash at Nichols School and
the University of Pennsylvania. Sadkowski and Dirk Dugan won the National Public
Parks Tennis Doubles in the early 1970s. In 1973, Sadkowski was a finalist in
both the city tennis and squash championships.

At age 23 he suddenly stopped playing tennis and squash and didn't pick up a
racket for almost eight years. In Sadkowski's own words, "I was burned out from
playing racket sports nonstop all of those years." Now living in Boston, he
plays once or twice a week for enjoyment.

Jeff Boychuk was another great local tennis player who had wins over Rev. Bob
Hetherington and Seth Bowen in the mid 1970s. He, too, stopped playing in his
mid 20s, citing "burnout." He now lives in Toronto and plays occasionally.

Anthony Mazareigos, 17, was No. 5 in The Buffalo News tennis rankings. He stated
that he has periodically suffered from burnout and it has greatly affected his
game. By taking short breaks from tennis, he now is playing better than ever.

Tournament and recreational players both suffer from burnout at different times.
What can they do about it?

The following suggestions could be helpful:

*Change your routine. One of the surest ways to burn out is to keep playing
without taking a break or changing your tennis regimen. When we are playing
badly we often feel that we need to keep playing to work through it. Nothing
could be further from the truth.

Even professional tennis players try to take at least one day a week off from
playing and sometimes two.

Most of us don't play six or seven days a week. However, you should try to add
variety to your game, such as playing against new opponents or playing more
doubles than singles.

*Take a break. If you dread going to the tennis courts because you feel totally
burned out you must take some time off. Usually, a week to 10 days is helpful in
recharging your tennis batteries. Anything longer than that could result in
great disappointment when you do return to play.

When you decide to take your break be sure to work on your fitness by doing
cardio and weight work. This is imperative and should also be done when you are
playing tennis to ensure that you are in top physical shape.

Working out, in addition to playing, will keep your body limber and will reduce
your chances of suffering serious injuries.

*Develop your mental game. You can't be thinking about your profession, your
spouse and kids, and other distractions while you're playing. Concentrate on
each and every point. Instead of worrying about winning every match, strive to
work on improving your game.

*Prepare for a tournament. Some tournament players feel that they have to play
up to the day before a tournament starts. They are only thinking of fitness and
their stroke production. Unfortunately, rest rarely enters their mind.

Of course, preparing for a tournament is important. However, you also need to
prepare time to rest. You should realize that making time for relaxation is just
as important as working on your strokes and fitness.

*Take lessons. There are many fine tennis professionals in the Western New York
area. They will be able to see what stroke weaknesses you have and can give you
valuable tips for strategy and playing mentally tough.

*Get a new racket. Sometimes trying or purchasing a different racket has worked
wonders for my game. Sometimes a lighter or heavier racket can do the trick. Be
sure to demo at least three rackets before you decide on purchasing a new one.

Talking Points

Frustration got the better of Ryan Harrison in his Olympic tennis debut on
Saturday.
The 20-year-old from Austin, Texas, ended play with a mangled racket when he
lost to Santiago Giraldo of Colombia 7-5, 6-3.

He slammed his racket to the grass in anger after losing the next-to-last game,
and when he double-faulted on match point, he broke his racket by again spiking
it.
Then it seemed as if he was called to the principal's office on Sunday, doing
an interview with NBC's Pat O'Brien at Wimbledon and apologizing for his
actions the previous day.
Harrison had nothing to apologize for. He is far from the first tennis player
to break a racket in frustration and hardly the first to do it on the Wimbledon
lawns.

The Brickyard 400 used to be the new and cool thing in NASCAR.
It seemed as if every inch of bleachers were taken at the Indianapolis Motor
Speedway, just like the heyday of the Indy 500.
Sunday's race at Indy was a typical example of what all NASCAR tracks are
experiencing these days -- fans are staying home in droves.
Cool or not, NASCAR is not what it once was.
That is really too bad, because the NASCAR calendar has a few must-see events
-- and the Brickyard is definitely one.
Even if the television ratings prove strong (and it will be tough going against
the Olympics this year), race organizers need ticket sales and sponsorships to
keep their date in the NASCAR calendar.
Otherwise, it will go dark.

Double champions
- what a racquet!

SECTION: Sport: squash, Pg.30

LENGTH: 185 words


TWO top North Lincolnshire squash players achieved a rare feat when they were
both crowned county champions in different categories - both using the same
racquet.

Paul Hornsby scooped the title of Lincolnshire Senior Champion for the third
year running at the recent championships in Grantham, writes Paul Gilder.

And Alan Borrill, a member of Listy's Sports Club with Paul, took the over 35s
title for the second year in succession.

But a broken racquet early on in his defence of the title meant Alan had to
carry on using Paul's racquet, which proved to be a lucky omen.

Paul, who is the club professional at Listy's, plays for a team in Pontefract in
the Yorkshire league and a team from Manchester in the Lancashire league.

He has recently started a junior coaching group in Scunthorpe and anyone who is
interested in taking part has been urged to contact the club on (01724) 280132.

LOCAL TENNIS;
Gibson fund grows locally

Atlanta has been a leader in a national fund-raising effort to assist Althea
Gibson, the terminally ill and destitute former Wimbledon and U.S. Open
champion. The Atlanta Friends of Althea Gibson and the Georgia Tennis Patrons
Foundation, Inc., have received up to $ 20,000 in donations and pledges since
last November, when Gibson's plight became public knowledge, according to
Patrons Foundation executive director Carolyn Cotton.

A gift of $ 5,000 along with numerous notes from fans were sent to Gibson in
East Orange, N.J., around Christmas, and another $ 10,000 was sent this month,
Cotton said.

One contributor, Angela Russo of Marietta, wrote: "Thank you for your
inspiration and the example of your life. You taught me that triumph is
overcoming obstacles and not giving up. Allow me to remind you now not to give
up."

Gibson, 69, became the first African-American tennis star in the 1950s, the
first to win a Grand Slam tournament.

To contribute to the ongoing fund, make checks payable to GTA Patrons
Foundation, Inc./Friends of Althea Gibson. The address is GTA Patrons
Foundation, 6100 Lake Forrest Drive, Atlanta, 30328.

BECKER'S RACKET

Local artist Christopher Parrott last week donated to the Collegiate Tennis Hall
of Fame in Athens one of the rackets used by Boris Becker when Becker won
Wimbledon as a 17-year-old in 1985. Parrott, the son of former AT&T Challenge
tournament director Brian Parrott, got the racket from Becker some months after
Becker's first Wimbledon victory. Parrott, 11 at the time, had compiled a
scrapbook of newspaper clippings highlighting Becker's emergence on the pro
tour, including his first pro victory in the U.S. (in a Portland, Ore.,
tournament Brian directed) and West Germany's victory over the U.S. in Davis
Cup. When Becker returned to Portland for an exhibition that year, Christopher
showed him the scrapbook. "Boris was mesmerized by it," Brian Parrott said. "It
was like his sudden rise to fame was flashing before his eyes." Becker thought
it was a gift, and Christopher obliged after giving it some thought. Becker gave
him the racket just before heading home. The racket's connection to collegiate
tennis is dubious, unless it's the fact Becker beat the 1979 NCAA champion,
Kevin Curren, in that memorable Wimbledon final.

Making a racket with his racquet: Destinite adds to his collection of winning
hardware

BYLINE: Andrew Metz, Destin Log, Fla.

SECTION: SPORTS

LENGTH: 395 words


Feb. 27--Don't let his warm demeanor and friendly handshake fool you. Jon
Wuerffel is a competitor.

The father of world-class athletes and a perpetual seeker of thrills, Jon is
probably the last person you want to oppose on a racquetball court.

Fresh off another great showing at the Florida State Singles Racquetball
Championships at the Sarasota Bath & Racquet Club, Jon was able to walk away
with the silver and bronze medals, a humble result for this frequently decorated
sportsman.

"It's real fast," said Jon, 64. "You can't play easy and win."

Jon's second-place finish came in the 60-plus Division, a group he has dominated
the past two years with two gold medals. His bronze came in the 45-55 A
Division.

But Jon wasn't the only Wuerffel decorated in the championship. His daughter,
and former Destinite, Sarah, achieved first place in the Women's 35-plus
Division and finished second on the Open bracket.

"It is a real accomplishment," said Jon. "She was playing against multiple
national champions."

Jon, a retired lieutenant colonel chaplain, started playing racquetball in 1977
for the Air Force's team. This eventually led to an Air Force Masters
Championship in 1986 and a silver medal at nationals in 2000 -- the same year
that his son, Danny, was named MVP of the World Bowl for the Reign Fire of NFL
Europa.

After flexing so much athletic muscle at this year's competition, you would
assume that much of Jon's concentration and effort are directed at racquetball.
But the sport is just another hobby for Wuerffel.

"I play too many other sports to devote as much time as everyone else," said
Jon. "I also fish, scuba dive and ride mountain bikes, and my favorite is riding
off-road."

He often takes dirt bike trips to Colorado where he enjoys trail riding.

"A healthy lifestyle is important," said Jon. "Mental, physical and spiritual
health are all a part of it. Older people think they can't keep their bodies in
shape, but they can. That goes for young people, too."

Local teams advance to Central Florida regionals

BYLINE: Nancy Morgan

SECTION: CLEARWATER TIMES; Tennis; Pg. 4

DATELINE: CLEARWATER



CLEARWATER - The USTA/Volvo team-tennis concept is catching on    locally.
Forty-one teams and 550 players participated in District 12    competition this
year - an increase of 170 players from 1987.

     This weekend in Lakeland, the district winners play in the Central
Florida regionals. Winners there advance to the state tournament in    August.

      USTA/Volvo team tennis is designed to define ability levels to    equalize
competition - like handicapping in golf. Levels run from 3.5    to 5.0. All
levels have two singles and three doubles positions, except    the 5.0 level,
which has one singles and two doubles.

     At the men's 5.0 level, the St. Petersburg Tennis Center    outperformed
the Royal Racquet Club and Lakewood Country Club,    finishing 6-0.

      "We had a lot of input from our players all season," St.    Petersburg
captain Walt Mazurek said. "We're close and bring a lot of    competitive
experience into the regionals."

      Jeff Winkler and Robert Wolfman lead the St. Petersburg team with    a
three-year .950 winning percentage at No.2 doubles.

      In men's 4.5 competition, the Seminole Lake Racquet Club finished    with
a 9-1 record and beat McMullen Tennis Center in a playoff.

      "This is the most competitive league I've played in the last 10    years,"
Seminole captain Andy Lynn said. "The local teams were strong    and equal.
We'll find out how good we are as a team in regionals."

      The Royal Racquet Club of Clearwater has two teams advancing to
regionals. The men's 4.0 and 3.5 teams won their respective divisions    with
7-0 records. Last year, both teams advanced through their    regionals to state
competition.

      The Royal 4.0 team, with all but one player older than 40, edged
Paradise Island (6-1) in the regular season with a 3-2 team win that    included
a third-set tiebreaker won by captain Dick Whissel.

      Buck Freeman, captain of the Royal 3.5 team, is confident. "We're
strong all around. Seminole (5-2) gave us the most trouble this year,"    he
said. "We were runner-up in the state competition last year and    plan to go to
nationals this year."

      In the women's competition, East Lake Woodlands won the 4.5    division
with a 10-0 record.

      "Our team took clinics, practiced, and worked hard on their games
during the season," East Lake captain Jean Lipton said. "I think we    have one
of the strongest 4.5 teams in the area."

      In the women's 4.0, McMullen Tennis Center is the district    champion.

     "We have a lot of depth in our singles positions and used four    players
this year," McMullen captain Cathy Carbo said. "I felt the    league was more
competitive this year than in years past, and hopefully    that competitive
experience will help."

      It is the second year for Dunedin in the USTA/Volvo league, and    the
women's 3.5 team completed the season 10-0. That Dunedin squad lost    just
eight of 50 individual positions and won seven team matches 5-0.

      "I think we're better-structured as a team," 3.5 captain Cheryl    Berendt
said. "We regularly practiced several times a week, and the    whole team was
supportive each week at matches."



        Designated champions: Vickie Stilwell won the women's 35 singles
title in the Designated Summer Championships at Vero Beach last weekend    and
teamed with Cassie Pluymers, formerly of Safety Harbor, to win the    35
doubles. Also, Stilwell won the Firecracker Classic at Innisbrook    July 2-4.



        Sunshine State Games: Karen Smith of Clearwater won the women's    35
singles division in Jacksonville last weekend. Vicki Knauff of Largo    finished
third.

Sports Mom: Ultimate Utility Player;
Local athletes share stories about mothers

BYLINE: NICK DASCHEL Columbian staff writer

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. b1

LENGTH: 925 words


Behind most extraordinary athletes is a mother of many talents.

She drives car pools, slices oranges for snacks, organizes candy sales, hunts
down athletic shoe bargains, keeps the scorebook.

And occasionally, dodges a tennis racket.

Dodge a tennis racket?

"I must have been 10 or 11 at the time," said Brett Pierce, a tight end for the
Dallas Cowboys and a graduate of Columbia River High School. "I was always a
real competitive kid, almost to a problem. I was at an age where I wanted to
beat my parents and everybody else.

"I'm playing tennis with my mom (Carol) one day, and I'm not doing too well.
She's whipping me pretty good. I'm getting kind of mad, and I figure, if I hit
the ball as hard as I can, she can't hit it back and it's my point. Well, that
doesn't work. Next thing you know, I throw my racket at my mom and walk off the
court.

"Threw my racket right at her. She made me go see the school counselor the next
day."

While maybe not as dangerous as Pierce's story, other prominent local athletes,
like soccer player Tina Frimpong, Richie Sexson of the Seattle Mariners, Rian
Lindell of the Buffalo Bills and Dan Dickau of the Boston Celtics, shared
anecdotes and memories about their mothers with The Columbian for Mother's Day.

Memories of Mom, from Clark County athletes

Tina Frimpong

Defender, U.S. Soccer

Local connection: Hudson's Bay graduate

Mother's name: Eka

Her influence on Tina and sports growing up: "My mom was the mom that really
didn't know much about soccer. To this day, I still wonder how much she knows.
But she was always at the games, sitting in her lawn chair with her blanket and
coffee. And she cheered loud. My sister and I could always hear her during the
games. To this day, I can still hear her voice in my ears. She was always so
supportive of us."

Her influence now: "She provides me with more mental support now. She's always
asking me how 'my heart is doing' and reminding me about some physical things,
like making sure I ate well and drank enough water. Even though we don't talk
about soccer much, I feel she is a huge part of my soccer life."

Jock or not a jock: "She actually ran track and loved running, and even today,
she gets a workout by going to the gym, but I would not call her a jock. She's
more of a walker nowadays."

Brett Pierce

Tight end, Dallas Cowboys

Local connection: Columbia River graduate

Mother's name: Carol

Her influence on Brett and sports growing up: "She kept me very well fed and I
was never malnourished. I don't know if I would have been as big as I am if I
hadn't ate like I had. She took the low intensity approach, which was kind of
nice. Strike out three times, and she still thinks you had a good game."

Her influence now: "We're a little more separated now because of the distance,
but whenever there's a big decision to be made, like when I got traded from
Baltimore to Dallas, she's interested. I like to bounce ideas off her. She gives
me a much different perspective than a lot of people can. She's in it for what's
best for me."

Jock or not a jock: "She's pretty athletic. A good golfer; the last time we
played, she beat me. I don't recall her throwing any clubs, though. Growing up,
my brother and I made fun of her not playing sports. She's not the most
coordinated human being I've seen. But she's a good golfer and a good ping pong
player."

Richie Sexson

First baseman, Seattle Mariners

Local connection: Prairie graduate

Mother's name: Allison

Her influence on Richie and sports growing up: "Probably more than anything
else, just supporting me and being there. Mom was always the team mom, bringing
the oranges to the soccer game. Mom couldn't care less how I did. She just was
always there. A very calm person. She didn't care if we were 0-for-3, 0-for-4,
touchdown, no touchdown."

Her influence now: "Just a comfort. She's my family. I've got a lot of people
pulling me different ways; they love you when you're doing great, but when times
are bad, not so much. With mom, it doesn't matter."

Jock or not a jock: "Not really, because when she was younger, they didn't
really allow it. She's 60 now. Back in the '50s, athletically it wasn't cool for
women to play sports. She was a good athlete. She likes to play tennis, and
she's pretty active."

Rian Lindell

Kicker, Buffalo Bills

Local connection: Mountain View graduate

Mother's name: Karla

Influence she had on Rian and sports growing up: "I played all the sports. She
was a football fan. She was a big soccer fan, too, and she got me into that
sport. But she didn't push me either way."

Her influence now: "She knows a lot more about what's going on than I do. She
knows all the stories. She keeps up pretty well. She definitely stays up on
everything. She's a fan of whatever team I'm playing for."

Jock or not a jock: "She was definitely a tomboy growing up. They didn't have a
lot of sports, though. Now, she's big into playing golf. She's pretty athletic,
but her knees aren't holding up too well from the soccer days."

Dan Dickau

Guard, Boston Celtics

Local connection: Prairie graduate

Mother's name: Judy

Her influence on Dan and sports growing up: "She was at every single game. It
wasn't as important to her that I play great. She just wanted me to have fun. My
mom is really low key."

Her influence now: "Not too much. I think the first couple (NBA) years was tough
for her because I wasn't playing very much. She enjoys watching me play. I know
she liked last year. I called home every few days and it sounded like she was
having fun."

Jock or not a jock: "Not an athlete, although I don't know if I want to answer
that."

Seniors take spotlight in state tourneys at Pinellas sites

BYLINE: NANCY MORGAN

SECTION: NEIGHBORHOOD TIMES; TENNIS; Pg. 18

LENGTH: 887 words



Adozen area adult teams will join more than 120 others in state competition this
week at three clubs in Pinellas County.

Fifty-two teams in the Super Seniors Doubles League for players at least 60
years old begin play in the USTA Florida Section state championship Thursday,
and 82 more in the Seniors Doubles League for those at least 50 begin
competition Friday.

Vying for USTA Florida Section titles in the super senior division are Timber
Pines Tennis Club (3.0), the St. Petersburg Tennis Center (3.5) and Shipwatch
Tennis Club (4.0) in the men's competition, and Timber Pines Tennis Club in the
3.0 and 3.5 women's divisions.

"We'll go with the lineup that won the local playoff for us and probably have
Michel Antoine and Brian Limberg play in our second match," said Fred DeJohn,
captain of the St. Petersburg Tennis Center team.

Heading that lineup for the opening match at Royal Racquet Club at 8 a.m.
Thursday will be DeJohn and Charles Dorrell in No. 1, Nick Karamessinis and
Woody Woodbury in No. 2, and Bob Allen and Andy Chau in No. 3. The opponent will
be a team from Ormond Beach.

"Since we finished the local season, we have been practicing playing a third-set
tiebreaker, which is the format we'll play at state," said DeJohn. "Otherwise,
we're doing what we think we need to do to be prepared."

This is the third consecutive trip to state for the SPTC. Last year, it
qualified in the senior league and in 1998 it advanced in the super senior.

"We won the super senior local playoff at Royal Racquet Club last month," said
DeJohn. "We think playing state there will be good luck for us this week."

Senior teams competing include Feather Sound (3.0), Innisbrook (3.5), Treasure
Island Tennis and Yacht Club (4.0) and Royal Racquet Club (4.5) for the women,
and Innisbrook (3.5), McMullen of Clearwater (4.0) and Safety Harbor Spa (4.5)
for the men.

The Treasure Island Tennis and Yacht Club was unbeaten in the regular season
among four teams and brings state and national experience to its first match at
11 a.m. Friday at Royal Racquet Club against Ocala. Judy Grim was on a team that
advanced to the nationals in 1996 and 1997; Pat Kelly and Susan Hobbs also were
on the 1997 team.

"After the team went to nationals three years ago, they had to split up and we
didn't have a team in 1998," said Patti Prestera, Treasure Island's captain.
"Susan and I formed a team last year and we went to state where Ocala eliminated
us. This year, we plan to beat them."

Prestera plans to place herself and Hobbs in the No. 1 position, Kelly and Lynn
Klein in No. 2, and Ann Worthington and Joan Plaster in No. 3. Grim, Gail
Nickerson and Margie Scheidt also will be used during the four-day competition.

"I really think we have a good team and a good chance at making it to nationals
again," said Prestera. "With the use of the third-set tiebreaker, what we need
to do is win the first set so we can set the pace in the second set."

The top four teams in their respective divisions advance to semifinal and final
play Saturday for the super seniors and Monday for the seniors. Preliminary
matches will be played at Royal Racquet Club (799-3200), Countryside Country
Club (796-1136) and St. Petersburg Tennis Center (893-7301). Super senior finals
are at Countryside; seniors are at Royal Racquet Club.

PRO LEAGUE: The Pinellas Pro League, sponsored by the Suncoast Tennis
Foundation, makes its debut at 7 p.m. May 25 at the Treasure Island Recreation,
Tennis and Golf Center. The format will include singles, doubles and/or mixed
doubles for club tennis directors and head and assistant teaching professionals
in social, competitive play.

The league will move throughout the county on a bi-weekly basis. For more
information, call USA community coordinator Jeff Davis at 360-6543.

K-SWISS LEAGUE: The spring session of the K-Swiss Tennis League concludes this
weekend with a tournament at the Cheval Country Club. Semifinals are Saturday
and finals Sunday.

Registration for the summer session continues through May 30 and includes men's
and women's singles, women's doubles and mixed doubles. Call 865-0615.

TEAM TENNIS: This summer's USA Team Tennis for youths ages 18 and under will
include the Red division for beginning players ages 6-12, White for intermediate
levels 10-14, and Blue for beginner to advanced level players 13-18. Players
should call Sam Vuille (867-9105), Phil Girardi (360-6062) or Doug Woods
(893-7301) by the June 16 deadline.

MORE JUNIOR EVENTS: This weekend, the McMullen Tennis Complex hosts Memories in
Clearwater, a state-sanctioned juniors singles competition for players 18 and
younger. Call tournament director Krishnan Anandan at 669-1919 today to beat the
entry deadline. Next weekend, juniors will be vying for a position in the
64-player draws of the third state-sanctioned designated singles tournaments for
the 18s, 16s, 14s, 12s and 10s. The May 27-29 competition is scheduled in the
Delray Beach area, with players accepted based on standings of the week during
the selection process. Topspin TV, a CBS show that highlights tennis from a
young person's point of view, is seeking youths 17 and younger who have
developed a creative talent associated with tennis. Contact the show through the
USTA communications office at (914) 696-7000.

Sporting Gear; Spring-Loaded Tennis Racquet

BYLINE: By S.Lee Kanner

SECTION: Section C; Page 11, Column 5; Sports Desk

LENGTH: 425 words


The Bancroft Slingshot tennis racquet is designed primarily for weekend players
who seek to improve their game. The racquet incorporates a spring system
embedded in the rim of the aluminum head. The strings are run through the tiny
steel springs in the top and in both sides of the head. The springs compress on
impact, hold for a split second, then release the ball, providing extra power
with no loss of control for the average player. The Slingshot has an open throat
design and a yoke piece that elongates the sweet spot. The grip is nine and a
half inches long, which is helpful for players using twohanded strokes. The
Slingshot, a product of the Bancroft Sporting Goods Company of Woonsocket, R.I.,
is made in light and medium weights and in different grip sizes. The racquet,
which can be used by both men and women, is pre-strung with tournament nylon and
comes with a cover. It sells for $109.99, at Herman's four stores in Manhattan
and at Herman's at Roosevelt Field in Garden City, L.I., and Paramus, N.J.

Insulated Apparel for Hunters

Manufacturers of camouflaged hunting garments are now using the Thinsulate
thermal insulation that provides warmth with less bulk.  Columbia Sportswear has
introduced a vest and a parka with that insulation, which is a blend of
polyester and polyolefin fibers. The nylonlined vest has a polyester and cotton
overshell, extra-large pockets with inside shell loops, and a high
corduroy-lined collar.  The parka, also nylon-lined, has a cotton-blend outer
shell, the same outer pockets and collar as the vest, an inside zip-closed
pocket, Velcro cuffs with corduroy lining and a snap closure over a two-way
zipper. Both are available in tan camouflage. The vest costs $44.95 and the
parka $75.99, at Ramsey Outdoor Stores, 226 Route 17, Paramus, N.J. 07652, (201)
261-5000.

Help for Aching Athletes

The Gillette Deluxe Heat Wrap/Cold Wrap offers three kinds of relief for
athletes with minor aches, bumps or bruises. A flexible electric pad, with three
settings - low, medium and high - provides dry heat. A special sponge insert
that fits inside the pad provides moist heat. A cold-pack insert, which is
stored in the refrigerator when not in use, is the third feature. The Heat
Wrap/Cold Wrap measures 6 inches by 20 inches and features Velcro fasteners,
belt loops, special shoulder loops and a vinyl liner. A small switch light
indicates when the heat unit is on and illuminates the setting. The set is
available for $25 at The Cellar at Macy's Herald Square store.

Die-hards are the lifeblood;
Racquetball is alive and well

BYLINE: By MARK BRADFORD; Tribune Staff Writer

SECTION: LOCAL; Pg. B6; SPORTS & RECREATION

LENGTH: 479 words


It is an easy sport to learn, this racquetball.

There isn't a lot of walking involved, because the balls all tend to bounce
right back to you.

There are not a lot of long windsprints involved.

The games are fairly short, with most 3-game sets being completed in less than
75 minutes, including breaks between games.

Yet, locally, the sport has fewer people playing it these days.

Long time manager at the South Bend Racquet club Roger Heise was around when
there were more players than there were courts available.

"I can't explain it myself," Heise said. "We used to have a lot more players and
leagues, now we have about 160 players/members and we are down to two league
nights."

Racquetball was the new sport in the 1980s, when TV shows like Thirty-Something
featured actors playing the sport on their shows. These days, Heise admits,
there are so many more things that people do.

Michael Ghyselinck, manager at the Michiana YMCA, said he has seen a decline in
the sport since its heyday in the late '70s and early '80s.

"Actually, it is cyclical," he said. "There are so many options for kids these
days and they get put on so many sports teams as a kid that they get burned out,
I think.

"Then again, earlier this year we had about 20 students from St. Joseph's High
School come over here and learn to play handball. Our courts (the Y has seven
courts) are still busy, especially in the evenings and there are a lot of
die-hard players out there who enjoy the game. When we have our once-a-month
kids' night, the courts are always full."

The current decline in popularity does not take away the appeal of the
fast-paced sport.

"It is probably one of the easiest sports to learn and play," Heise said. "It is
very inexpensive to get started and you don't need a lot of protective gear or
uniforms, although we recommend goggles.

"In all my 25 years here, we have only had one injury that required an ambulance
and that was an unfortunate heart attack, so we recommend that anyone looking at
trying the sport either check with their doctor or at least work up to it slowly
if they have any issues like that. But other than that, you will get hit in the
back with a ball occasionally or have a pulled muscle or two, so the sport is
very safe."

It can also be a social sport.

"I would guess that 90 percent of our membership for racquetball is male," Heise
said. "But this is a sport that men and women can play equally well and we have
several couples here who play each other for something to do together."

Leagues are another way of making the sport social.

"Right now we have an A League and B league," Heise said. "Our spring sessions
have fewer players but our winter session has up to 10 players. We have had
players as old as 60 in the league but for the most part our A-League players
are in their 30s and B League are in their 40s."

HardKohr to sell business to Heritage Hills

BYLINE: Ashley M. Wislock and Sean Adkins, York Daily Record, Pa.

SECTION: BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL NEWS

LENGTH: 627 words


June 07--YORK, Pa. --

HardKohr Sports & Fitness in York Township will soon be under Heritage Hills
ownership, said Matt DeRose, owner of Heritage Hills.

Owner Jim Kohr sent out an email message shortly before 10 a.m. letting members
know that he plans to sell his business to Heritage Hills Golf Resort &
Conference Center, with whom he had been locked in a four-year legal battle.

"I have tried my best at making this business successful," stated Kohr in the
email. "I have had so many people help me financially along the way, for that I
am grateful.

"I feel horrible about the situation. I will work at paying off my debts, but
please be patient as I figure out the best course of action. I am sure many of
my financial supporters are anxious to see some type of re-payment plan. I want
you all to know that I used your money in good faith when I thought I had the
financing in place and was ready to move forward."

Kohr said his financing fell through one day before he planned to buy the
building in which his club his based.

HardKohr and Heritage Hills have sparred over the building, at 2810 East
Prospect Road, since 2008, when Kohr purchased the Yorktowne Racquet, Fitness
and Sports Complex, which operates on Heritage Hills property.

DeRose said the lease for Yorktowne Racquet had been terminated; Kohr said he
believed the lease was still good for five years.

What ensued was a lengthy legal battle, during which Heritage Hills attempted to
get HardKohr evicted from the property. A judge denied that motion in June 2009.

Operations at HardKohr will continue as normal under Kohr's business, DeRose
said. "Right now, the plan is to maintain the club as it exists today through
end of the summer," he said.

Once the legal paperwork goes through, the fitness center will come under the
Heritage Hills name, DeRose said. The building will be used for tennis and
fitness long-term.

DeRose said he is "relieved" the four-and-a-half year legal sparring over the
property is finally coming to a close.

"We're excited about opportunity," he said. "It's a shame that (Heritage Hills)
and Jim Kohr had to go through all this."

DeRose didn't know how long it would take for the club to transition to Heritage
Hills ownership, but said the process should be "fairly quick."

Details of the court case:

In June 2008, Kohr bought Yorktowne Racquet & Fitness Club, which eventually
became Hardkohr Sports & Fitness.

Almost immediately, both Kohr and Heritage Hills, the owner of the building
which houses the club, fell into a dispute over the lease agreement regarding
the property. At the time, Heritage Hills stated that it had terminated
Yorktowne Racquet's lease agreement during the same period that Kohr was
finalizing his plans to buy the business.

Both Kohr and Heritage Hills turned to the York County Court of Common Pleas to
settle the dispute.

From June 2008 through June 2010, Yorktowne Racquet underpaid its rent owed to
Heritage Hills, according to court document. In addition, Yorktowne Racquet
failed to pay rent for April, May and June 2010.

Based on that default, Heritage Hill again terminated the lease on July 2, 2010
and stated that Yorktowne Racquet was in debt for $52,648.56, according to court
documents.

In November 2011, Heritage Hills filed a complaint with the York County Court of
Common Pleas claiming that Yorktowne Racquet is liable to Heritage Hills for
$193,982.22.

That amount represents the balance of the principle of a 2003 loan that
Yorktowne Racquet agreed to pay the original owner of the land at 2810 E.
Prospect Road. That land was eventually sold to Heritage Hills.

Baxter feels at home in tourney

NATIONAL MEN'S 50: Sarasota resident grew up on Bath & Raquet courts

Rill Baxter's tennis career reached full circle Monday at the Ken Wagstaff
Memorial USTA National Men's 50 Clay Court Championships being held at the
Sarasota Bath and Racquet Club.

The lifelong Sarasota resident learned how to play the game from the Wagstaff
when he was only a child.

In fact, Baxter was on hand when Wagstaff opened Sarasota Bath and Racquet on
Oct. 1, 1969 -- and even before that.

"I was with Ken when he was looking at this property when it was just a big
field," Baxter said after winning his match Monday, 6-1, 6-1, over Alex Kor of
Maryland in the Round of 64.

"He told me then he was going to build the nicest tennis club in Florida."

Wagstaff's widow, Penny Wagstaff, is the tournament director.

Besides playing at the facility as a child, Baxter also played there as a member
of the Riverview High boys tennis team during his high school days before
playing tennis collegiately at Pepperdine University in Malibu, Calif.

After college, Baxter turned pro.

"I was lucky enough to travel all over the world playing professional tennis in
my 20s," Baxter said.

"I've played in about every country in the world, basically. It was a remarkable
experience."

Baxter let tennis stay on the backburner for some time as he established his
career at Morgan Stanley Wealth Development, where he has worked for the past 20
years.

But after winning a 45-and-over tournament in Tampa last September, he got busy
on the courts once again.

Baxter lost to Michael Tammen, this week's No. 1 seed of Portland, in the
semifinal round of the Men's National Indoor tournament earlier this year.

Baxter is seeded No. 4 among the tournament's 128 entrants, vying for the
national clay title at 50- and-over.

"I just wanted to get a feel and get rid of some of the pre-tournament jitters,"
Baxter said after breezing past Kor. "It's still a little hard to relax even
though I've been trying to get loose."

Baxter is scheduled to play Arizona's Tom Breece this morning in the Round of
32.

"I try not to look at the draw," Baxter said. "I just try to play the field. In
senior tournaments anything can happen in this heat and humidity."

Baxter has played in major tournaments before, but this one is special because
of Wagstaff and where it is being played.

"This place has a great tradition," Baxter said. "There are a lot of people who
have wonderful feelings about this place."

Planned journalistic mission is in disarray; scope drastically cut

At a time when the journalism world was struggling with intense financial
pressures brought on by digital transformation, Pierre Omidyar's bold plan was a
source of great excitement for those who care about the field.

The eBay founder was going to sink $250 million into a brand new news outlet
that would publish ambitious articles about significant subjects.

But not just that. In a blog post last December, Omidyar said his new venture
would cover "politics, government, sports, entertainment and lifestyle, arts and
culture, business, technology, and investigative news."

Omidyar thought that creating a large general-interest site would help ensure a
large audience for the audacious investigative stories he anticipated.

That was then.

Nearly a year in, Omidyar's First Look Media empire consists solely of The
Intercept, a digital magazine headed by Glenn Greenwald of Edward Snowden saga
fame that focuses on government surveillance and related topics.

The fate of a second digital magazine, Racket, is uncertain. Conceived as a
satirical publication in the tradition of the late great Spy, Racket has yet to
publish news, but certainly has been making news.

Last week the top editor, Matt Taibbi, known for his biting articles in Rolling
Stone, left the company before a single issue was published. A remarkable piece
on The Intercept, packed with candid details rarely seen in an article on the
behind-the-scenes goings-on of a publication's parent company, painted a
devastating portrait of disarray. Not just at Racket but at First Look Media in
general.

And Omidyar has drastically curtailed the scope of the mission. He has scrapped
the idea of building an omnibus overarching website. And he has jettisoned the
plan to create a large collection of single-topic digital magazines such as The
Intercept. Instead, Omidyar said, "We'll begin by building out the two we've
started and then explore adding new ones as we learn."

That was before Racket blew up. There's no shortage of lessons to learn from
that fiasco.

The shrinkage of Omidyar's grand plan is truly disappointing, if not surprising.
At a time when the journalism business has been thoroughly disrupted, the need
for new approaches and new players is intense.

And while The Intercept is publishing some strong material, a highly specialized
website is a far cry from the far broader vision first articulated by Omidyar.

What went wrong? Well, lots of things. The article in The Intercept reveals a
severe culture clash between the rules-oriented Silicon Valley crowd at the helm
and the freewheeling journalists they had hired.

Also, starting a massive journalism undertaking of the kind envisioned by
Omidyar is a complicated challenge. As The Intercept article stated, "First Look
and the editorial staff it hired quickly learned that it is much easier to talk
about ... high-minded, abstract principles than it is to construct an
organization around them."

But perhaps the most daunting obstacle was the lack of a clear vision. Look at
successful web start-ups -- as diverse as Politico, BuzzFeed and ProPublica, not
to mention an array of local news ventures -- and you'll see they all have a
laser focus, a distinct identity.

There's no doubt Omidyar had great intentions. He believes in journalism as a
force that can make society better. His foundation has contributed to journalism
initiatives in the past, and in 2010 he launched the Honolulu investigative and
public affairs website Civil Beat.

But while he sought advice from knowledgeable people, Omidyar is not a
journalist or a figure familiar with that idiosyncratic field. If he were he
would have anticipated the managerial difficulties he has encountered.

In his blog post announcing the narrowing of the enterprise, Omidyar
nevertheless emphasized his unflagging determination to build a valuable news
outlet.

"I am committed to creating a journalistic organization that has a major and
positive impact for the greater good -- and doing so with a start-up spirit of
trying new things, learning as we go and following an iterative process," he
wrote. "We will take lessons from failures and apply them to the next things we
try."

Let's hope he can pull it off. Journalism needs all the help it can get.

USA Adult League titles on line this weekend

BYLINE: NANCY MORGAN

SECTION: NEIGHBORHOOD TIMES; TENNIS; Pg. 22

LENGTH: 878 words



The USA Adult League playoffs have come down to their third and final weekend.

Saturday, the Racquet Club of St. Petersburg has three men's teams in contention
for district championships while four other teams are unbeaten: the Treasure
Island Tennis and Yacht Club's 4.0 women's team, the East Lake Woodlands and
Renaissance Vinoy 3.5 squads, and Feather Sound Country Club in the 3.0.

Last Saturday against the Bardmoor Tennis Club, Treasure Island won all five
positions to boost its confidence for this Saturday's match with East Lake.

"We're a strong team and hard to beat, although, like any other team, on any
given day we are beatable," said Heather Nicoll, Treasure Island's captain.

Earlier in the season, Treasure Island lost 3-2 to East Lake.

Winning for Treasure Island last weekend were Barbara Kalvoda and Kathy Moll in
No. 1 and No. 2 singles respectively, and the doubles teams of Christy Monroe
and Nicoll, Susan Hobbs and Gale Nickerson, and Darlene Winterroud and Cecelia
Tucker.

"We're optimistic about our chances this weekend," added Nicoll, "but we know it
won't be easy."

Men's coordinator Peter Laker expected the men's competition - particularly in
the 4.0 division - to be very competitive and that's the way it has turned out.

"Saturday's match with Bardmoor is going to be very tough," said Ben Godwin,
captain of the Racquet Club's 4.0 squad. "We lost 5-0 to Bardmoor early in the
season and then won 3-2 against them. I think the singles positions are going to
be key for us."

In last weekend's match with Countryside, Nga Duong won in three sets in the No.
1 spot, as did Bill Young and Todd Myers in No. 1 doubles. Pete Wills and Bob
Barlow in No. 3 doubles added a third win.

"We probably have had the best year with our singles players," said Godwin, "and
have four players to rely on - that's rather unusual for a team."

In addition to Duong, Joe Chambers, Mal Kilbride and Gary Lucke are available
for the two required singles positions. Last year, the Racquet Club represented
the area in regional competition and hopes to do so again.

In other men's matches, the Racquet Club faces Royal Racquet Club in the 3.5 and
4.5 divisions. Racquet Club wins would determine the district champion; losses
would force a tiebreak situation in the 3.5 division while Royal would be named
the 4.5 champion.

After this weekend, winning teams will prepare for the regional competition July
23-25 in Longboat Key. Beyond that are the state and national championships.

JUNIORS AT STATE: Local juniors travel to the Orlando area this week to prepare
for competition in the USTA Florida State Closed Singles Championships. State
champions will be named in four girls and four boys divisions.

Area players in girls competition include Sydnie Zillig, Nicole Cercone and
Kristin Rannala in the 18-and-under division; Natalie Tirapelli, Alexandria
Liles, Kelly Nelson, Tiffanie Kalvoda and Janna Ruth in the 16s; Kaela Kennedy
in the 14s, and Rachel Silverberg, Elena Berry and Christina Liles in the 12s.
Cercone is the No. 10 seed in the 18s and Liles is No. 4 in the 16s.

Boys entrants are Michael Murray, Kyle Nelson, Jonathan Brett, Kris Goddard and
Brad Wells in the 18s; R.J. Murray, Lou Scaglione and Kevin Zimmerman in the
16s; Brandon Pierpont, Fred Johnson and Greg Bulleit in the 14s, and George
Navas in the 12s. Michael Murray is the No. 1 seed and Nelson is No. 6 in the
18s, R.J. Murray is No. 10 in the 16s, and Navas is No. 6 in the 12s.

TENNIS IN THE SUNSHINE: The 20th annual Sunshine State Games include
state-sanctioned tennis competition for juniors and adults in singles and
doubles and will be staged July 8-11 at the Hillsborough Community College
Tennis Complex in Tampa.

Juniors will compete in age divisions 18 to 10; adults in six skill-level
divisions. Cost is $ 10 for junior singles and $ 7.50 per person in doubles.
Adults may register for singles with a $ 15 fee and $ 10 for doubles. Entry fee
includes a SSG T-shirt by the July 2 deadline. Call Mike Sophia at (352)
955-2120.

CENTER SPORTS CAMPS: Gary Bond, teaching professional at the St. Petersburg
Tennis Center, began a weekly tennis and sports camp for youth ages 5-17 this
week and it will continue through Aug. 6. Girls and boys are offered a variety
of sports to learn to enjoy as a lifetime activity. The camp runs 9 a.m. to 3
p.m. at a cost of $ 65 per week or $ 20 daily. For information, call the center
at 893-7301.

FREE LESSONS: Opportunities for free youth tennis lessons are available by
calling 536-8136 and speaking with a representative of the Tampa Bay Youth
Tennis Academy. All ages and levels are encouraged to become involved.

TEAM TENNIS: Registration continues through Friday for this summer's USA Junior
Team Tennis for players age 6 and older. Two divisions are offered: Red for
players ages 6-12 at the 1.0 to 2.5 levels according to Junior National Tennis
Rating Program (JNTRP) guidelines, and White for those 10 and older at the

30 for a current USTA member; $ 36.50 for first-time USTA membership enrollment.

Riverview rolls into finals 5-0 | Rams sweep singles matches vs. Tampa Plant

BYLINE: Doug Fernandes

SECTION: C; FL Sports; Pg. 2

LENGTH: 323 words


BOYS REGION TENNIS: CLASS 4A-4

SARASOTA - Even without Tuesday's sun, there was a warm feeling of familiarity
for Holly Holton and her Riverview High boys tennis team.

Last year en route to a spot in the state tournament, the Rams' sixth team berth
in Holton's seven years as coach, Riverview defeated Tampa Plant in the regional
semifinals.

Tuesday afternoon, the Rams once again faced the Panthers in the Class 4A-Region
4 semifinals. And, once again, the outcome was the same, as Riverview advanced
to the regional final with a 5-0 victory at the Bath & Racquet Fitness Club.

Riverview will stay home at the Bath & Racquet to host that final on Thursday at
3 p.m., against the winner of the St. Petersburg High-Steinbrenner regional
semifinal.

The Rams won their seventh-straight district crown with a victory over St. Pete,
then kept up their strong play against the Panthers, district runners-up.
Riverview swept singles play, making doubles action unnecessary.

The Rams' No. 1 player, Antoine Sanchez, defeated Plant's Thomas Harmon 6-2,
6-3. At No. 2, Riverview's Finn Anderson beat Marshall Echevarria 7-5, 6-3. Ram
Gabriel Von Kessel, at No. 3, defeated Stephen Echevarria 6-2, 6-1. Riverview's
No. 4 player, freshman Charlie Putrino, beat Adrian Mendoza 6-1, 6-4. And at No.
5, Ram Brandon Lup, the only senior on the team, defeated Alex Lachat 6-1, 6-0.

Holton said a key to this year's team is each player caring about the other.

"They support each other, and even when I'm coaching (one of them), they're
always like, 'how's so-and-so doing?' Tennis is an individual sport, but they
work very well together and they get along well."

Holton's team this season has been strengthened at two spots. The freshman
Putrino stepped into the No. 4 spot, and Anderson transferred from Wyoming to
fall in behind Sanchez at No. 2. The two also form the Rams' top doubles team.

"As a coach," Holton said, "you always like to get a nice new surprise."

Foot Behind Head, Woody Harrelson Goes Positively Yogic

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

SECTION: Section C;  Page 3;  Column 1;  Living Desk

LENGTH: 1216 words


WE were entering the fourth chakra, the chakra of love.

So where was Woody?

It seemed that Mr. Harrelson was tied up in Brooklyn on the set of his next
film, "Money Train." That explained his late entrance at the New York Health and
Racquet Club, where he has been teaching a yoga class twice a week with his
personal trainer.

Somewhere between the time a dozen or so club members gathered in a circle to
pass along a kiss, cheek by cheek, and the moment they broke off as partners for
a little mutual torture, Mr. Harrelson breezed in and assumed position, ready to
twist and contort his body with the person he calls his "guru man," Ken Scott
Nateshvar.

Clearly, Mr. Harrelson, 33, who made his television name playing the hapless
second-fiddle bartender on "Cheers" and has since made a handful of successful
feature films, does not need a day job.

He is teaching something called "yogassage" -- a partner-style form of yoga in
which two people take turns bending, stretching and flipping each other over --
because, he says, he feels the message of the "yin and yang thing," the "union
of body and spirit" that yoga imparts should be shared with strangers.

On a whim, Mr. Harrelson and Mr. Nateshvar decided to teach a class during the
few months they are here shooting "Money Train," and the Health and Racquet Club
on 13th Street was happy to give them space. Members have been permitted to take
the class, which ends this week. "Tesh and I have always wanted to teach
together," Mr. Harrelson said, referring to his trainer, who goes by that
nickname. "We want to get yoga out there."

Mr. Nateshvar, a yoga teacher for 15 years and a former gymnast, has done the
lotus position with plenty of movie stars and, he said demurely, with Hillary
Rodham Clinton. Right now, he follows Mr. Harrelson on his various projects
around the country.

"Yoga is extremely important in my life," said Mr. Harrelson, whose looks and
demeanor resemble those of his character from "Cheers" (awkwardly youthful,
slightly tan and in need of a haircut) rather than of the man he played in the
1994 movie "Natural Born Killers" (excessively cranky, constantly sneering,
generally unpleasant).

"Partner yoga enhances the balance, and what the world needs right now is more
balance," he said.

As the two-hour class heated up on a recent Monday night, Mr. Nateshvar and Mr.
Harrelson called out instructions to each exerciser as he or she tried to drag a
partner by the feet into a position meant to be therapeutic. While the rest
struggled to pin their partners to the ground and to wedge elbows under their
shoulder blades, the two teachers pulled and stretched each other limb by limb,
not unlike wet laundry, in the center of the room.

Was this man spread-eagle in the air, supported only by Mr. Nateshvar's feet,
the Inner Woody, the real yogi-in-the-making?

The room of participants -- some of them fellow Nateshvar disciples and others
tenderfeet who were doing their best to remain still despite the fact that their
partners were trying to force their heads through their locked ankles -- looked
on in awe.

Next, the classmates sat locked back to back, one leaning forward, the other
struggling for balance. They reached behind their heads and grabbed each other's
faces. Then, one partner would lie on the floor only to be lifted by the feet
and swung gently but firmly from side to side, as if to dislodge a few quarters
and a subway token or two.

The class ended with a demonstration of advanced techniques, which involved Mr.
Nateshvar, who appeared to be made of Silly Putty, balancing Mr. Harrelson
precariously on the tips of his fingers. Finally, they folded into each other
like a huge pair of sweat socks.

Only then did Mr. Harrelson, whose face had remained in a focused frown
throughout the class, break into an actual grimace of pain. He moaned. He made
that yoga sound -- "ooh ooh ohh ummmmm" -- and he looked as if he might start
weeping at any moment.

At that point it was hard to imagine that this man had made his name by
exchanging vacuous banter with a barmaid named Carla. Could he really slide out
of this human gridlock to announce he was out of vermouth?

The next day, in an interview on the set of "Money Train," which co-stars Wesley
Snipes, Mr. Harrelson explained how he had become interested in yoga several
years ago when he met Mr. Nateshvar at a retreat.

"I had tried yoga before, but it meant nothing to me until I met Tesh," he said.
"He just blew away every concept I ever had about it."

With the kind of lopsided grin often found on the faces of cute high-school
hockey players, Mr. Harrelson shared some world views.

"We live in a white, male-dominated world, economically and politically," said
the white male actor, stretched out on the floor of his trailer while his
partner, Laura Louie, who gives him shoulder rubs between scenes, kept their
2-year-old daughter, Deni Montana, occupied outside. On a nearby table sat a
book, "Taoist Secrets of Love: Cultivating Male Sexual Energy," and several
bottles of carrot juice. The cramped trailer smelled vaguely like a medicine
cabinet full of vitamins.

"I think it is imperative that we all find balance," he said. "We need to take a
breath and slow down, and that is how I originally got into it. I needed to slow
down. My brain was always in a fairly manic state of frenetic energy. The
mind-set I got into is what I think most actors get into. We need to succeed --
TV star, movie star -- you know, where does it end? With Tesh, I started to find
my balance. To learn to relax, to access my energy."

He elaborated on his theory of balance: "When you are in your teens and 20's,
your kundalini energy gets rooted down in the lower chakra," he said, referring
to the lowest and most sexual of the seven energy centers of the body according
to Hindu and Buddhist traditions.

"The thing yoga does is loosen up the spine," he said. "With a loose spine, the
energy can go up to the crown chakra, and that is where you find the balance --
once that whole kundalini stuff is running up the spine."

Mr. Nateshvar, who wandered into the trailer, explained that kundalini, Sanskrit
for "power of mother nature," really means "universal life energy." It is
unclear how the energy of the universe ended up in Mr. Harrelson's spine, but
still, it sounded nice.

Mr. Harrelson's love for yoga is so great that he has incorporated it into his
new film. It was his idea, he said, to pull his leg behind his head, a yoga
position, while seated on a bar stool. The position takes lots of coaching from
Mr. Nateshvar.

During the scene, Mr. Snipes picks up Mr. Harrelson and carries him through the
bar, in position. After it is shot, Mr. Snipes calls out: "Am I the only one
here who saw that it was Tesh who put this guy's foot behind his head? Am I?"
Mr. Harrelson laughs and limps away.

Back in the trailer, the actor and his trainer go into bear-hug position. "Tesh,
you're amazing."

"No, you're amazing."

They sit down to partake of plates of vegetarian takeout, along with Ms. Louie
and Deni.

Even Deni, apparently, has picked up some yoga. "She can push me into a
stretch," Mr. Harrelson said, flopping down into cobra position to demonstrate.
"She also does the downward dog."

National tourney berths are on the line

Area teams travel to Daytona Beach this week to challenge for bragging rights in
the Florida Sectional Senior Doubles League Championships.

The winners advance to national championships.

Sectional competition opens Friday at the Florida Tennis Center for the Treasure
Bay 4.0 women's squad and the Racquet Club 4.5 men's team. McMullen of
Clearwater plays in the men's 4.0 division.

"We have a good group of players and strong doubles team combinations, but I'm
still a little nervous about the competition," Treasure Bay captain Patti
Prestera said. "With players now rating themselves, it will be interesting how
even the levels are going to be.

"We have 10 players going, each with set partners," Prestera said. "I plan to
keep them together unless there are injuries and we have to mix them up."

Teams include Prestera and Carol Hancock, Barbara Brutus and Hank Skoczen, Lynn
Klein and Pat Kelly, Marion Murch and Ria Graham and Ann Worthington and Susan
Hobbs.

First up for Treasure Bay on Friday is Sarasota, followed by Naples and
Gainesville on Saturday. Sunday morning is the semifinal round for the top team
in each of three flights, along with a wild-card squad. The championship match
is at noon.

In 2001, Prestera, Klein, Hancock, Worthington and Hobbs were members of a 4.0
senior team that won state and advanced to nationals.

The Racquet Club squad also has some national championship experience.

Tim Brady, Ken Heretick, Ralph Howe and Michael Reilly have played in nationals,
captain Bill Young said.

"I would say that just about everyone on our team has had some postseason
playing experience," Young said. "That competitive experience is definitely
helpful to all of us when we go to the next level."

Young partners with Mike Carroll, Brady with Howe, Jim Pesuth with Carl Stiel
and Jan Lagergren with Heretick.

Mitch Lee has played with several partners, and Reilly's status is unknown due
to his work schedule.

"At the 4.5 level, there should be a lot of charging the net and aggressive
play," Young said. "That's really the only way to play 4.5 doubles, and that
will be our goal."

In the 4.5 Flight II competition, the Racquet Club faces Orlando on Friday,
Ormond Beach on Saturday and Pensacola on Sunday. The winners of Flight I and II
battle Sunday at noon for the title.

In all, 13 teams are in the 4.0 women's event and three in 4.5. Men's squads
include 13 in the 4.0 class and eight in 4.5.

SUMMER LEAGUE: This week marks the beginning of the Pinellas Tennis League, a
three-position women's doubles circuit.

In the Tuesday division are Treasure Island Tennis and Yacht Club, the Phil
Green Tennis Academy at Safety Harbor, Feather Sound Country Club, Seminole
Lakes, McMullen and Bardmoor Golf and Tennis Club.

Thursday's division includes Seminole, Shipwatch, McMullen, Westin Innisbrook
Resort, the Renaissance Vinoy and Bardmoor I.

The winner will be determined by greatest sets won.

NET SHOTS: Andres Molina defended his top seed to win the men's 45-and-over
title in the Temple Terrace Adult Championships.

Rafeal Kucharski finished first in the men's open 32-draw. Michael Halisky,
assistant teaching pro at St. Petersburg Country Club, reached the semifinal of
the men's open by eliminating the No. 1 player.

Royal Racquet Club II was first among 27 teams in the Pinellas Area Doubles
League with 103 points.

Bardmoor III was second with 96, followed by Seminole Lakes (94), Racquet Club I
and Vinoy I (93).

Pat Bellcourt and Sylvia Hagerman defended the No. 4 doubles position for
Bardmoor Golf and Tennis Club, the two-time champion Racqueteers team.

BETWEEN THE LOBS, IT'S LOLLIPOP TIME

BYLINE: By FRANK LITSKY

SECTION: Section 11NJ; Page 1, Column 1; New Jersey Weekly Desk

LENGTH: 856 words


EDGEWATER HIROSHI SUDA stood at the net, knees bent, his racquet at the ready.
The ball came straight at him, and he punched a two-handed forehand volley
across the net.

Then he sucked his thumb.

Moments later, Hironori Kondo ran to his backhand side for a ball. He drew the
racquet back and hit the ball.

Then he ran to his mother and held her by the legs.

Hiroshi is nearly 4 years old, and so is Hironori, his best friend. They are not
quite ready for Wimbledon or Flushing Meadows, but they have been taking weekly
tennis lessons since June and are thriving.

''Sure, they're young,'' said Roberto Coriat, who is teaching them, ''but we
believe anyone 3 years old should be able to play tennis, or at least learn. We
started our daughter, Cynthia, at 3 and our son, Robert, at 4, and they're
playing in junior tournaments now.''

Mr. Coriat is the tennis director at the Binghamton Racquet Club. He teaches
people of all ages, but prefers children ''because they're easier to deal
with.''

The lessons for his prodigies last no more than 30 minutes. The children do not
stand at the base line and belt the ball; instead, they stand near the net and
Mr. Coriat throws the ball at them underhand. They swing at it with scaled-down
racquets that cost $10 or $12.

''The idea is to make contact with the ball,'' he said. ''They can do that, and
it's exciting for them. So they enjoy it and they want to come back. They're
good kids. Watch what they do when the lesson is over.''

When the lesson ended, 100 balls littered the court.

''All right,'' Mr. Coriat said, ''who can pick up all the tennis balls on his
side first?''

Hiroshi and Hironori grabbed every ball in sight, making a game of a normally
tedious job.

''It's psychological,'' Mr. Coriat said. ''Create a competition, and they'll
play all day.''

The children have been going to the club since they were old enough to walk.
Kiyoko Kondo and Teruko Suda, their mothers, play tennis there, too; they are
among the many women who, when they are on the court, leave their children in
the club's nursery.

Both families come from Tokyo and live in Fort Lee. Meiji Kondo is a stockbroker
in New York City, and Yoshiaki Suda is an executive in Rockleigh for Takasago
USA, which produces chemical materials. They, like their wives, play tennis.

The parents say they are not interested in preparing their sons for careers in
tennis.

''I don't want Hironori to be a pro or a tournament player,'' Mrs. Kondo said,
''but I want to give him a sense of doing all kinds of sports. Roberto tells him
to keep his eyes on the ball. That's fundamental to all sports.

''Hironori does everything. This year at the pool in our apartment building, he
swam without water wings and went 15 meters.''

The tennis lessons were Mrs. Kondo's idea. In June, she said, she and her
husband were playing tennis, and Hironori was sitting on a bench outside the
court, watching them play.

''I want to play,'' he said.

His mother took it from there.

The first lesson, Mrs. Kondo recalled, did not go well. Hironori thought he
could play right away, she said. Instead, Mr. Coriat threw the ball at him and
told him to catch it. Three-year-olds miss more than they catch, but
coordination started to come.

Mrs. Suda said that she, too, wanted a well-rounded son.

''We want to let Hiroshi know the fun of life,'' she said. ''He has been taking
piano lessons since January, and he likes it. I don't know if he's a good piano
player, but he looks forward to his lessons.''

Mr. Coriat, a 38-year-old Venezuelan, looks forward to the lessons.

''We had five youngsters come in for lessons,'' he said. ''All were 3 1/2 years
old, but some had little coordination or concentration, and we asked their
parents to wait until next year.''

Mr. Coriat is serious about his students. Both Hironori and Hiroshi speak
English and Japanese, and during the lessons their mothers are never more than a
few steps away.

Mr. Coriat has taken lessons in Japanese, and is bilingual when he urges his
pupils to ''come here,'' ''go there,'' ''watch the ball,'' ''racquet in
position'' or ''turn.''

Between lessons, there is homework. The mothers put their sons through movement
drills at home, throwing balls and having them catch them. They work on
coordination.

Mr. Coriat is a strong believer is tennis for children. His club is the site of
his R. C. Tennis Academy, where he teaches 100 children 4 and older. With
financial help from Hudson Toyota in Jersey City, he has sent his best pupils to
tournaments in Venezuela and Puerto Rico.

''That's incentive for them,'' Mr. Coriat said. ''Tournaments are nice, but not
the most important thing. When the kids are playing tennis, you know where they
are.''

Except, of course, when someone like 3-foot-3 Hiroshi or 3-foot-5 Hironori is
barely visible above the three- foot-high net. But they quickly become visible
as they walk away, dragging their racquets and giggling.

''These lessons are a good idea,'' Mr. Coriat said. ''I don't know if they'll
become good tennis players, but they're having fun playing tennis. And that's
the whole idea.''

Squash is her racket;
Sandy Springs girl aces in the sport

BYLINE: Linda Jerkins

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 03D

LENGTH: 565 words


Almost every day, 14-year-old Michelle Quibell picks up her Prince racket and
hits the court.

But Michelle is not a tennis ace. She's one of the best young squash players in
the United States --- and the world.

"It's a fast, fun game," said Michelle, a ninth-grader at the Marist School in
Atlanta. "But many people I meet have no clue about what squash is."

Squash, which is often compared to racketball, is a challenging racket sport
played on an enclosed, four-wall court.

Popular throughout the world, it's a fast-growing sport with adults and kids in
the Atlanta metro area.

Michelle, of Sandy Springs, started playing competitively when she was 10. You
might say she inherited her talent for the fast-action sport. Her mom, Lana, was
once a national champion squash player.

Michelle also finds time to play soccer. In squash she is ranked No. 2 in the
United States among junior girls in the under-19 age division.

"Playing up --- in an older age division --- gives me more competition,"
Michelle said. She often plays against men because they offer her the kind of
challenge she wants.

Last summer, Michelle won the Dutch Junior Open in Amsterdam. Next July, she
will play in the world's junior championship in Belgium.

"Michelle is a talented, smart player," said Tom Rumpler, her coach. "Most of
all, she has the desire. She wants to be the best."

This week Michelle is in Stuttgart, Germany, with the U.S. women's team at the
women's world championship sponsored by the World Squash Federation.

What does Michelle think of being the youngest member of the five-woman team?

"It was an honor to be asked to play," she told News for Kids.
 Get geared up to hit the court Racket: Squash rackets resemble badminton
rackets, but they're more sturdy. Prices range from $ 30-$ 150. Balls: Squash
balls are about the size of a golf ball and come in four varieties, ranging from
very slow to fast. The different kinds of rubber balls are coded with colored
dots. Most players use a yellow-dot ball, though red is often used for teaching
because it bounces better. Other basics: Shatterproof goggles ($ 20-$ 30) and
athletic shoes, such as tennis or volleyball shoes.
 What's it all about?

In squash, one player hits the ball against the front wall of a four-wall court.
The other player tries to return the ball before it has bounced more than once
on the floor. Points can be won only by the server.

When the server loses a rally, the opponent becomes the server. The first player
to score 9 points is the winner. A match consists of the best three out of five
games.
 Did you know? The game of squash has also been known as squash rackets. The old
game of rackets was first played in the 18th century in Fleet Prison in London.
As a way to pass the time, the inmates took to hitting a ball against the prison
walls. A hundred years later, rackets players in England invented squash as a
practice game. The game got its name from the soft or "squashy" ball used. ---

Racket Maestro Makes His Annual Migration

BYLINE: By KENNETH ROSEN

SECTION: Section SP; Column 0; Sports Desk; Pg. 10

LENGTH: 903 words


Many people who love tennis and play regularly within New York's five boroughs
know Woody Schneider. At one time or another, they need him. And so do their
rackets.

Each year -- just before the estimated 700,000 attendees throng the U.S.T.A.
Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Flushing, Queens, for the United
States Open -- the pro shop he operates there is emptied, closed and repurposed.

Schneider and his business partner, Joan Dziena, run NYC Racquet Sports and two
branches of Grand Central Racquet in Manhattan, but they also have managed the
National Tennis Center Pro Shop since 2005 on a year-to-year contract.

Before this year's United States Open begins on Aug. 31, they will have moved
the merchandise in the pro shop, which covers some 2,000 square feet, to their
Manhattan locations. The business closes (this year from Aug. 8 to Sept. 13),
and a big-name libation lounge sometimes takes its place. After the tournament,
the pro shop can reopen.

Synonymous with tennis and racket stringing for more than three decades,
Schneider had a humble beginning, and his career is dotted with diversions like
the annual uprooting from Queens. Much like the history of his stores, he is
forever at war with renovations, disruptions and construction.

''I should have gone into the scaffolding business,'' Schneider said recently
while he and Dziena plotted the annual migration of the pro shop from Queens.
''No matter where I've been, I've been affected by construction.''

In 1975, working at Commuter Sports Center for Marvin Weiss -- at the time the
owner of three stores inside Grand Central Terminal -- Schneider weathered
changes brought on by the construction of the Grand Hyatt New York hotel and a
face-lift to the terminal's Beaux-Arts facade.

But by 1991, Weiss, who for 30 years leased the sporting goods store, a
bookstore and a card boutique from Metro-North, owed about $182,000 in back
rent. Though most of the unpaid rent came from the bookstore, he closed all
three stores on New Year's Eve, leaving Schneider on his own.

After the closure, Schneider rented a small space in 1992 below the private
tennis court of Donald Trump inside the terminal. He dedicated the shop, the
beginning of Grand Central Racquet, to racket stringing.

The foot traffic past his shop in those days was about the same as the yearly
attendance at the Open. What no one told him was that an enormous renovation
would soon disturb his setup.

At the start of 1994, an overhaul began, Schneider said, and about 10 business
were allowed to stay in Vanderbilt Hall and operate out of free-standing,
hand-built shanties. He strung rackets for hours at a time, using a machine that
looks like a kitchen mixer with horse shoes where a bowl should be.

''It was a big disappointment because, the original space, we literally had tens
of thousands of people walk past us every single day,'' Schneider said.

Construction continued to hamper his business, lasting into 2000. Schneider
eventually moved to a kiosk next to a watch repair service in the terminal
between Tracks 38 and 39. He had also gone into business with Gene Scott, then
the publisher of Tennis Week magazine, who had rented a store on East 44th
Street near Madison Avenue and needed help running it.

Schneider operated the Grand Central kiosk and store simultaneously. He used
Post-it notes for price tags, and by 1998 Schneider ran the business outright,
turning it into the second branch of Grand Central Racquet.

Dziena was dating Schneider around the time the business expanded, and they
caught the eye of Bill Mountford, the former director of tennis at the United
States Tennis Association, who approached them about running the organization's
pro shop.

However, there was the catch that required closing up and moving the pro shop
during the annual tournament on the U.S.T.A. grounds. Around October 2010, after
Schneider and Dziena signed another annual contract with the U.S.T.A., Grand
Central Terminal underwent more renovations, including opening the Trump tennis
court to the public as the Vanderbilt Tennis Club, and Schneider again found his
business surrounded by scaffolding in the northwest corner of the terminal.

''That just completely devastated business,'' he said. ''People believed we were
out of business.''

However, Schneider and Dziena survived with support from loyal customers and the
U.S.T.A., which did not respond to requests for comment.

At NYC Racquet Sports, which they opened in 2009 on West 35th Street, Dziena sat
behind a desk in an upstairs loft while Schneider sat nearby and showed a
picture on his cellphone of the vacant pro shop.

Dziena talked about the retractable roof at Arthur Ashe Stadium, scheduled for
completion in 2016, and she prompted Schneider to plug their newest endeavor, a
racket courier service for at-home pickup and delivery. Schneider joked that he
might take one of the racket-stringing machines home with him in case of a
late-night job. ''I'm thinking of it,'' he deadpanned.

As they plotted the logistics of this year's migration from Queens, a sidewalk
shed and concrete barriers obscured their storefront on Madison Avenue.
Nevertheless, they were again ready for the move, as they have been now for 10
years, no matter the challenge.

''Listen, a Jewish boy from Queens was not meant to drive a U-Haul truck, I'm
telling you,'' Schneider said. ''It's not pretty.''

TENNIS: Rod Carlyle Generating topspin on the ball requires the proper
stroketennis

SECTION: EXTRA; Section J; Page 9

LENGTH: 413 words


One of the most requested lessons pros are asked for is to teach their students
how to hit topspin. The pros hit so hard and have the ball clear the net by
several feet, only to have the ball dip suddenly inside the baseline. This is a
desirable shot to possess.

To be able to generate topspin properly, you first have to understand how it is
initiated. Unfortunately, if you listen to most of the commentators on
television, it sounds as if you take your racket and pull it over the top of the
ball. If you attempt to hit topspin in this manner, you quickly find out that
all you do is hit the ball straight down into the ground. Obviously, if you hit
the top of the ball, it goes down.

Topspin is achieved by starting your racket below where impact will take place,
and hitting up and through the ball, finishing high.

If you watch most of the pros hit their groundstrokes, you will find that they
finish most of their swings with the racket going over their shoulders.

If you are just starting to learn how to hit topspin, feel like you swing your
racket from below your knee, pull out toward your target and then relax your arm
and let your elbow bend so your hand pulls up and over your shoulder. When
watching pros such as Andre Agassi or Michael Chang hit their two-handed
backhands, it appears that they actually hit the stroke with their racket on the
follow-through. This severe pulling up on the ball generates the topspin, not
coming "over the ball."

Most of the top players do change grips to enhance the amount of topspin they
achieve. By having their racket face closed at point of contact, they get more
of a brushing action on the ball, causing more spin and thus a more severe dip
on the ball. However, the severe topspin shots such as Bjorn Borg used to hit
are not used as much recently, as players have opted for a semi-western grip
instead of the full western. The semi-western allows the players to hit the ball
much faster, since the more spin you put on a ball the slower it travels.

Adding topspin to your game is a great decision, but your best bet is to
schedule a private lesson with your pro and learn how to hit it correctly. Not
only will you learn faster, you will likely also not develop the elbow problems
many people do when they try to "hit over the ball."

Online pharmacy racket: probe to examine links abroad

BYLINE: Express News Service

LENGTH: 335  words

DATELINE: Mumbai


Probe into the multi-state Internet pharmacy racket has exposed the use of
Internet to trade in contraband substances.

The Narcotics Control Bureau had arrested a Navi Mumbai-based supplier Ram Patel
for supplying banned and illegal drugs through the fraudulent online pharmacy.

Two other involved, Hyderabad-based Imran Khan and Venkatesh Rao, were arrested
earlier for their role in the racket. The entire operation took five months.

While Khan's role was to ensure that the drugs ordered online reached the
clients, calls were being handled by eight employees at his call centre Limra IT
Solutions. Rao, a software diploma holder, allegedly ensured that he brought his
share of clients via e-mail. The probe has now shifted to Hyderabad as the
racket mostly operated from there.

Yashodan Wanage, NCB zonal head for the western region, said, "The inbox of Rao
has shown close to 5,000 pending orders on psychotic substances and oxycodone
and hydrocodone drugs at the time of arrest."

The mails showed that the online portal had clients in Australia, Europe,
Malaysia and USA. "But what interested us is the manner in which the business
operated. There were unified hubs for each region and country. So for all the
clients from America phone calls and e-mail orders were consolidated at a single
point. In case of USA it was a hub in New York," said Wanage. The advantage of
such a channel is that "there is very limited area for leaks".

The entire logistics was allegedly catering to a foreign cartel as it took the
NCB atleast five months to intrude and make contact with the portal moderators
and suppliers. "They were clear that they would not take any Indian orders as
they did not want trouble," said Wanage.

The inbox showed that the clients were made to believe that the portal was a
foreign one, while all the drugs were being sent from India via couriers through
consolidated hubs where the source destination's identity is concealed. "The
couriers were being wrongly declared at the exit airports," he added.

'Boom' Serves And Slow Courts

SECTION: Section 8; Page 11; Column 2; Sports Desk

LENGTH: 207 words


To the Sports Editor:

Robin Finn writes that wide-body racquets have speeded up the serve and made the
game faster ("Does Power Tennis Make Poor Tennis?" in The Times, March 8). Then
why aren't players storming the net behind every serve since a faster "boom"
serve should favor the server and volleyer?

I suggest that in spite of the wide-bodied racquet and speed of serves, the
balls now are less live, and the hard courts are slower; the ball sits up and it
is more difficult to put a ball away. The big serve-and-volley game, however,
still works on the faster grass surface. That's when power servers and volleyers
like Edberg, Becker and Stich have the advantage.

Finally, shoulder and elbow injuries as Finn mentions may be caused by using
today's racquets and trying to hit the big serve (although metal and graphite
racquets were originally sold as an aid in helping absorb the shock to the elbow
caused by wooden racquets). But is there a correlation between arm injuries and
the slower courts and deadened balls? And aren't tennis players -- from pre-teen
to adult -- playing practically year-round? Many former tournament players used
to break the season by resting.

REVIVAL NETS CLUB OWNER A NEW RACKET

Operators of the new $ 7 million King's Point Racquet Club and Fitness Center in
west Belleville say they're getting a bounce from a revival in local interest in
tennis.

King's Point has run smoothly in its first month of operation, Ken Hayden, the
club's general manager, said.

"It's going better than we thought it would," he said. "Our tennis operations
probably couldn't be better. People I know who had quit tennis for years are
coming back here to play.

"It's something new and exciting for them," he added.

Hayden was hired by John Connors, the developer of King's Point, to manage the
new club at the end of South 74th Street in Belleville, between Illinois routes
13 and 15.

The club, which opened Sept. 18, has six outdoor lighted tennis courts and eight
indoor courts. It also has a 25-yard-long outdoor swimming pool; sun decks and
snack bar; a 12,500-square-foot fitness center with aerobics, an
exercise-machine room, lockers, showers, a sauna and whirlpool; a restaurant and
a deli; a lounge and bar; a day-care area with a capacity of 110 children; an
outdoor children's play area; and an atrium viewing area over the indoor tennis
courts.

Everything except the swimming pool has been opened to members, Hayden said. The
pool will open late next spring.

The day-care center opened almost two weeks before the rest of the club. The
day-care center helps to serve, not only club members, but also the new Magna
Bank operations center next door. That building has 750 employees and no
day-care, Connors has said.

King's Point has about 80 full-time employees.

Hayden said Carli's Restaurant at King's Point is open to the general public for
lunch and dinner Monday through Friday, and for dinner only on Saturday and
Sunday. The separate deli is open for lunch and dinner seven days a week. The
restaurant also has banquet rooms.

The restaurant has hired as its chef Mike Hogan, who worked for several years at
Tony's Restaurant in downtown St. Louis, Hayden said.

Connors, the brother of tennis star Jimmy Connors, has said he's been able to
book all the courts at King's Point for eight to 10 hours a day while charging $
18 to $ 23 an hour for court time.

Connors said he decided to build the new club in part "to give something back to
the city of Belleville," where the famous family grew up.

John Connors and some partners had a successful business venture a few years ago
in starting the original Alton Belle riverboat casino. Connors and new partners
have since formed Vision Gaming Inc., which is developing casinos in Cripple
Creek, Colo., and at Las Vegas, Nev.

Connors said King's Point is the first major tennis and fitness club to be built
in the St. Louis area in the last 25 years.

He said he believed interest in tennis was growing after waning in the last few
years. "You can see it on a daily basis, with the youth starting to play again
on public courts," he said.
