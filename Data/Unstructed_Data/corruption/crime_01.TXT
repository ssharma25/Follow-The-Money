CITY RANKS NO. 1 IN CRIME PER CAPITA, FBI REPORTS;
POLICE CHIEF DISPUTES FINDINGS FOR '98: "CRIME HAS BEEN GOING DOWN"

BYLINE: Bill Bryan; Of The Post-Dispatch

SECTION: NEWS, Pg. A1

New FBI crime statistics put St. Louis at the top of the nation's major cities
in overall crime rate, but police officials and others doubt the accuracy of
that report.

The FBI recently released preliminary statistics showing that in 1998, the city
ranked No. 1 in crime per capita, which is total crimes adjusted for population
size.

Police officials say that ranking is not an accurate picture of crime in the
city. They point out that in 1998, crime fell in the city of St. Louis in all
categories except larceny. Larceny includes the theft of auto license tags, a
persistent problem in major cities in Missouri, where the tags are valuable.

"It's not a fair comparison to look at it on a per capita basis," St. Louis
Police Chief Ron Henderson said Thursday. "It's not an accurate representation
of what has happened with the St. Louis crime rate for the last several years.
Crime has been going down here."

St. Louis had a total of 51,459 crimes in 1998, slightly more than the 51,214
crimes in 1997.

The 1998 crime numbers include 113 murders, 168 rapes, 3,500 robberies, 5,067
assaults, 9,042 burglaries, 26,893 thefts, 6,676 motor vehicle thefts and 661
arsons.

The preliminary statistics include only city numbers, none for St. Louis County
or the surrounding municipalities in the metropolitan area.

The FBI's ranking is based on its Uniform Crime Reports for 226 major cities.
The data are reported by police departments. Some police agencies, including
Philadelphia's, have been accused of under-reporting crime.

The total numbers of reported crimes are then divided by population numbers to
arrive at a crime rate. That rate is expressed in this report as the number of
crimes per 100,000 people.

By dividing St. Louis' population of 344,153 (according to the FBI) into its
51,459 total crimes, St. Louis had 14,952 crimes per 100,000 people living in
the city.

Atlanta was second in the country with 14,031 crimes per 100,000, and Orlando,
Fla., was third with 14,003.

Kansas City was ranked seventh; it had 53,727 crimes, but its population is
larger than St. Louis'.

That population adjustment means that Detroit ranked 9th with 1.17 million
crimes; better than Topeka, Kan., and Flint, Mich. And Orlando and Tampa ranked
higher in crime than Miami and Detroit.

Per capita crime statistics also negatively affect major cities because they
measure residents but not transients and commuters in cities, said Capt. Dave
Heath, acting chief of detectives for the St. Louis Police Department.

"We have a total population in the city of 2 million on any given day," he said.
"It's not accurate to just look at the permanent population of a city."

Serious crime has fallen sharply in recent years. St. Louis in 1998 had its
lowest number of homicides since 1964, Heath added.

St. Louis has a spotless record for accurately reporting all its crimes to the
FBI, Henderson said, unlike other cities. St. Louis' crime numbers also are
independently audited, officials have said.

Other cities don't do as good a job counting, Henderson said.

A recent investigation by the Philadelphia Inquirer showed that the 1998 numbers
provided by Philadelphia police did not comply with the FBI standards for
reporting crimes, significantly affecting that city's crime rate. Some serious
crimes were being mischaracterized and understated, the paper found.

St. Louis' larceny numbers are being overstated because they include the license
tag thefts, which have a high dollar value because of the thieves' efforts to
avoid the cost and expense of getting licenses renewed, vehicles inspected and
cars registered.

"Every license tab that's stolen is counted as a theft, and every window that's
broken is marked down in the numbers," Henderson said.

Many of the country's other major cities contain suburban settings, but St.
Louis does not, police officials said. And most of St. Louis is poor; but other
major cities such as New York and Los Angeles show a more diverse economic base,
affecting crime trends, Henderson and Heath said.

If St. Louis' metropolitan area were compared with the metro areas of those
cities, Henderson said, this area would fare well. Total crime and crime rates
are lower outside the city limits.

Overall, crime rate is down

DATELINE: WASHINGTON



While it remains unacceptably high, serious crime in the first six months of
1994 fell by 3 percent nationally from the same period last year, the FBI
reported Saturday.

The semiannual decline followed annual decreases of 2 percent in 1993 and 3
percent in 1992.

Florida, however, led the country in total crimes in 1993. Dade County, for
instance, took first place in property crime and in violent crime with a total
of 135 of these crimes committed for every 1,000 Dade residents, the FBI
reports in the newest edition of its annual publication, Crime in the United
States.

The agency also examined past and present homicide patterns to find an
unprecedented shift in national murder patterns during the 1990s, with a sharp
increase in random killings by strangers.

"Every American now has a realistic chance of murder victimization in  view of
the random nature the crime has assumed," the FBI said in the report.

"The advent of this trend has generated a profound fear of murder  victimization
in that the circumstances surrounding homicides are perceived to  be more
irrational."

The FBI said the public's concern about more vicious and senseless murders  also
reflects involvement by younger victims and killers, with more juvenile  gang
homicides in the past decade.

Federal officials offered no explanation for the overall downward crime  trend
and cautioned against too much optimism.

"Any decline in reported crime is welcome, but the level of crime is still
unacceptably high and it must be substantially reduced," said a statement
accompanying the report.

The FBI divides serious crimes into two categories, reported from cities  with
populations of at least 100,000:

Crimes of violence: murder and non-negligent manslaughter, forcible rape,
robbery and aggravated assault. Tampa-St. Petersburg came in 10th nationwide  in
this category; Jacksonville ranked sixth.

Crimes against property: burglary, larceny/theft and motor vehicle theft.  While
Dade County easily led in this category, Broward and Palm Beach counties  ranked
fourth and sixth nationwide, respectively, both in overall crime and in
property crime.

The report's final figures showed an estimated 14.1-million serious  offenses
were reported in 1993 to law enforcement agencies across the nation,  or 5,483
crimes for every 100,000 inhabitants.

Aggravated assaults accounted for 59 percent of the violent crimes reported
last year. Robberies comprised 34 percent; forcible rapes, 5 percent, and
murders, 1 percent. Firearms were the weapon of choice in 32 percent of all
murders, robberies and aggravated assaults.  Crime

Violent Crime Drops 2 Percent; Total Crime Rises in New Jersey

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY,  Special to The New York Times

SECTION: Section B; Page 6; Column 5; Metropolitan Desk

LENGTH: 582 words

DATELINE: TRENTON, June 24


For the first time since New Jersey began compiling statewide statistics on
crime 25 years ago, the state recorded a decrease last year in each of four
categories of violent crime -- homicide, rape, robbery and aggravated assault.

The state's 15 largest cities continued to lead the list in the number of all
crimes, but when the report compared where crime was rising fastest, suburban
and rural areas led urban neighborhoods, according to a report released today.

The figures, released on the eve of the Legislature's planned vote on the state
budget, immediately became enmeshed in the political fighting between the
Democratic administration and the Republican legislative majority.

In a statement accompanying the report, Attorney General Robert J. Del Tufo said
that the Republican budget proposal, especially $39.6 million in cuts to his
department, "places in grave danger and jeopardy the physical and economic
well-being of the citizens of New Jersey."

The Attorney General and Gov. Jim Florio also used the release of the report to
renew the administration's attack on a Republican plan to repeal the state's ban
on assault weapons.

421,663 Reported Offenses

The Senate president, Donald T. DiFrancesco, said Mr. Del Tufo's comments were
politically motivated.

"I think he's wrong," Mr. DiFrancesco said. "I think he's saying that because
the Governor's people think they have to scare people."

Overall, there were 421,663 reported criminal offenses in New Jersey in 1991, an
increase over 1990 reports of less than one-half of 1 percent, according to the
Uniform Crime Report, a tally of crime data from local, state and Federal police
agencies.

That increase compared with an overall increase of 2 percent for the Northeast
-- which includes the states of Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New
Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Vermont -- and a 3 percent
increase nationwide.

While violent crimes increased by 5 percent nationwide, they decreased by 2
percent in New Jersey and by 1 percent in the Northeast as a whole. Nonviolent
crime increased by one-half of 1 percent in New Jersey and decreased in the
Northeast region at a similar pace. Nonviolent crime in the entire country
increased by 2 percent.

"Our tough drug laws, gun laws and community policing initiative have clearly
been a contributing factor in reducing the number of murders, rapes, robberies
and aggravated assaults," Mr. Del Tufo said.

Camden was the state's most crime-ridden city, followed by Newark, Jersey City,
Trenton and Paterson. But overall, every category of crime decreased in urban
areas from 1990.

With robberies and homicides showing the biggest increases, crime in suburban
and rural areas increased in every category except for aggravated assault and
motor vehicle theft.

Despite the overall 2 percent drop in violent crime, the state had the
second-highest number of reported violent crimes since it began its Uniform
Crime Report in 1967. There were 49,119 violent crimes reported last year,
compared with the record 50,067 in 1990, the report said.

Motor vehicle thefts, assaults against police officers, and drug arrests
decreased. Burglaries, larcenies, bias incidents and domestic violence all
increased.

Officials expressed particular concern about an 18 percent increase in reported
bias crimes -- from 824 in 1990 to 976 in 1991 -- and a 10 percent jump in the
number of domestic violence offenses, 55,698, including 61 slayings.

South, tourist areas hit hard

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 9A

LENGTH: 292 words


Tourist areas and Southern urban areas have the nation's highest overall crime
rates, according to FBI crime statistics.

USA TODAY analyzed crime data in all metropolitan areas with populations above
100,000: the cities plus their suburbs.

The study found crime looks dramatically different when urban areas are viewed
as a whole.

The metro areas with the highest crime rates in 1994 were:

-- Miami-Dade County.

-- Gainesville, Fla.

-- Tucson, Ariz.

-- Myrtle Beach, S.C.

-- Tallahassee, Fla.

By comparison, the Detroit area ranked 82nd in total crime, despite its bad
reputation.

The safest metropolitan area: Johnstown, Pa.

Why was the crime rate so high in many areas not normally known as crime-ridden?

Southerners tend to settle disputes themselves, leading to fights,
criminologists say. Also, more crimes are always committed when the weather is
warm.

The tourist areas suffered from high levels of theft, from shoplifting to
purse-snatching. Also, tourist areas become much larger cities during tourist
season, so their average population may be greater than Census figures indicate.

"We do not have a serious felony crime rate in this area," says Capt. Warren
Gall of Myrtle Beach, S.C., although his area ranks fourth in property crime and
18th in violent crime.

Gainesville had high rates of many crimes: rape, aggravated assault and theft.
But the 38,000-student University of Florida campus, located in Gainesville,
didn't have crime rates any worse than other large universities.

The FBI prefers using metro areas, rather than cities, to compare crime rates.
But both metro areas and cities make for imperfect comparisons because cities
are so different: Some have inner cities; others sprawl like suburbs.

Unlike the Canadian system, criminal law in the U.S. is a matter of state
jurisdiction, with some exceptions (drug offences and inter-state crimes, for
example, fall under federal law). As a result, the U.S. has not one criminal
justice system, but 51 (counting the federal level). Both laws and punishments
vary, sometimes widely, from state to state.

This variation produces, in effect, dozens of experiments in crime control. Can
a jurisdiction curb crime by putting more offenders in prison longer? Most
criminologists think not. State-by-state comparisons suggest they are right.

Take New York State. The spectacular decline in crime in New York City between
1992 and 1997 is justly famous. Less well known is the fact that over that same
period, the number of state prisoners (the vast majority of whom are from New
York City) grew slowly compared to that in other states. In fact, over those
five years, New York State prison expansion was the second-slowest in the U.S.

Over the same period, California's prison population grew nine times as fast as
New York's. But the incidence of crime in California did not drop by the same
proportion. On the contrary, violent crime fell far more sharply in New York
State, with the drop in California only reaching 40 per cent of the decline in
New York State.

Or consider the two Virginias. West Virginia boosted its prison population by
131 per cent over the last decade and saw a four-per-cent drop in crime. Across
the border, Virginia's prisons grew by 28 per cent, while the state enjoyed a
21-per-cent drop in crime.

Broader comparisons underscore the fact that stuffing prisons is an ineffective
way to control crime.

Louisiana, Texas, and Oklahoma have the three highest incarceration rates at
793, 779, and 681 per 100,000 population respectively (excluding inmates in
federal and county institutions). North Dakota, Maine, and Minnesota have the
lowest rates at 146, 130, and 129 per 100,000 respectively (almost as low as
Canada's 119).

And yet, despite the immense gap in incarceration between the top three states
and the bottom three, the states with high incarceration rates are not safer
places. In fact, North Dakota has the lowest violent crime rate in the United
States. Maine ranks 48th; Minnesota, 39th on the index of violent crime in the
U.S.

Louisiana, with the highest incarceration rate in the U.S., has the
seventh-highest rate of violent crime. Texas is 19th; Oklahoma, 21st.

In fact, states that use prison less tend to have lower violent crime rates. New
Hampshire and Vermont, which have low rates of incarceration, fall just behind
North Dakota as the states with the least violent crime.

On the other hand, states with a high rate of incarceration tend to be plagued
by crime. Florida and South Carolina, both of which have high imprisonment
rates, are near the top of the violent-crime list.

Of course this evidence, while suggestive, is not hard proof. It could be that a
low crime rate simply means there are fewer criminals to put in prison. It's
also true that any number of other differences between the states may account
for their varying crime and imprisonment rates, including degrees of
urbanization, economic development and cultural norms. It's obviously not just
crime policy that sets Minnesota apart from Louisiana.

But even when very similar states are compared, it becomes clear that putting
more people in prison doesn't cut crime.

Consider Louisiana and Mississippi. Louisiana's incarceration rate is more than
50 per cent higher than its neighbour's, yet crime rates in the two states are
all but identical.

Or consider Minnesota and Wisconsin. While Minnesota has a Canadian-style
incarceration rate of 129 prisoners per 100,000 people; its neighbour has a more
typical American rate of 380. Despite this enormous gap, the two have nearly
identical violent-crime rates: Wisconsin is 42nd among the states, while
Minnesota is 39th.

Perhaps most telling are the Dakotas. North Dakota's low incarceration rate of
146 per 100,000 is far outstripped by South Dakota's 347 per 100,000. And yet
South Dakota has marginally more violent crime than its northern namesake.

All of this suggests something many criminologists have argued for years:
Criminal justice policies have little effect on broad crime trends. The slogan,
"tough on crime" is a misnomer: Harsh punishments may be tough on some criminals
but they have never been tough on crime.

Nassau Is Maligned on Crime Rate, Study Says

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON

SECTION: Section B;  Page 7;  Column 4;  Metropolitan Desk

LENGTH: 447 words

DATELINE: MINEOLA, L.I., Nov. 20


If people in Nassau County are inordinately afraid of crime, blame Joel Rifkin
and Colin Ferguson, a professor of criminology said in a study on crime released
today.

The professor, Harvey Kushner, said crime in Nassau is at its lowest level in 20
years, and much lower, on a per capita basis, than in either New York City or
Suffolk County.

In the study, Professor Kushner attributed the perception of a high crime rate
here to high-profile cases like those of Mr. Rifkin, the serial killer, and Mr.
Ferguson, the gunman who killed six people aboard a Long Island Rail Road train.

"This is not to say that Long Island hasn't had its fair share of crimes that
justify national attention," Dr. Kushner said in the report. "But an eager media
spends a disproportionate amount of air time playing the 'crime card.' Clearly,
a blitzkrieg of media coverage is bound to make people fearful of crime."

Dr. Kushner is the chairman of the Department of Criminal Justice at the C. W.
Post Campus of Long Island University in Brookville. He prepared the crime
study, released today, at the request of Denis E. Dillon, the Nassau County
District Attorney.

His report links Nassau's low crime rate to demographic factors, like an aging
population and a high median income.

"Take, for example, Nassau County's number of intact families, among the highest
in the nation," Dr. Kushner said. "The 1990 census reports that more than 66
percent of Nassau's families are headed by traditional married couples."

He said he did not mean to denigrate the single-parent family. But, he said,
"The traditional intact family, like income, is a correlate of a low crime
rate."

Reported incidents of crime in neighboring Suffolk County have also dropped
since 1994, according to the study. Suffolk, however, had 33 percent more crimes
than Nassau in 1994, with almost twice as many of murders, burglaries and
larcenies.

The difference between crime rates in Nassau and New York City is even more
dramatic, according to Dr. Kushner's report.

The 1994 crime rate for every 100,000 people in New York City was 7,235.7. In
Suffolk it was 3,852.2, and in Nassau it was 2,645.6. In Westchester County, the
rate was also higher than in Nassau, at 3,522.7, according to the Federal Bureau
of Investigation.

Dr. Kushner, who based his study on the F.B.I. data, found that violent crimes
like murder are less frequent in Nassau than in other counties near major cities
across the country. His study included statistical crime data for Broward
County, Fla., near Miami; Oakland County, Mich., near Detroit; Terrant, Tex.,
near Dallas County, and Orange County, Calif., near Los Angeles.

Atlanta ranks low as healthy place for kids;
Crime rate is cited in national report

BYLINE: Mara Rose Williams; STAFF WRITER

SECTION: LOCAL NEWS, Pg. 1C

LENGTH: 337 words


Atlanta ranks as one of the least healthy cities in the country for children in
a national study to be released today.

The city's high crime rate is the primary reason it was ranked 200th out of 207
cities graded by Zero Population Growth, which describes itself as the nation's
largest grass-roots organization concerned with population growth.

The Children's Environmental Index suggests that "smaller cities provide a
better environment for children," said Sharon Pickett, who directed the research
and edited the index.

The index surveyed cities of 100,000 people or more and the largest city in a
state, according to Pickett. The rating is based on the assumption that factors
such as pollution, teen pregnancy, poverty and crime "have a profound influence
on a child's ability to grow into a healthy and productive adult."

According to 1993 statistics, Atlanta led all large cities in violent crime
rate. Because crime creates such a dangerous and unstable environment for
children, it weighed heavy on Atlanta's ranking, the study said.

Last month, based on FBI crime figures, Atlanta was ranked fourth in violent
crime, but that was among cities of more than 250,000 residents. Newark, N.J.,
which took over the top spot among most violent cities in the nation, was the
second unhealthiest city for children.

Also pointed out in the index is the correlation between the social economic
problems that were used as indicators.

For example it stated, "In Atlanta, Georgia, the city with the worst violent
crime rate, 43 percent of children live in poverty, and its 8.5 percent
unemployment is above the average."

"I'm sure that Atlanta is not proud of that rank," said the Rev. Joseph Lowery,
president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. The SCLC two years
ago launched a stop-the-violence campaign in Atlanta targeting the city's youth.

"But you can't deny, Atlanta is a violent city," Lowery said. "It's crime rate
is much too high, and its children are too much at risk."

Violent crime down, but murders up in small towns

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3

LENGTH: 442 words


It seems that a cynic could read newspaper headlines and news articles on the
Internet and conclude that the world is populated by robbers, rapists and
murderers.

But we all know that's not true.

In fact, overall violent crime in the United States was down 4 percent in 2011
compared to 2010, according to the FBI, which collects crime information from
law enforcement agencies across the country.

And violent crime has decreased at least 3.5 percent every year going back to at
least 2007, according to the FBI.

According to a , murder was down 1.9 percent from 2010 to 2011, and forcible
rape, robbery and aggravated assault all dropped 4 percent during that time as
well.

Property crime fell 0.8 percent, along with arson at a dip of 5 percent, but
burglary rose 0.3 percent.

Murders spiked in smaller towns, but more on that later.

The FBI does not have town-by-town breakdowns of crime, but did look at crime
rates by U.S. region.

In the Midwest, defined by the FBI as Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio,
Wisconsin, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, South Dakota and North
Dakota, violent crime fell 4.9 percent overall.

The region also exceeded national declines in forcible rape (down 4.2 percent)
and aggravated assault (down 6.1 percent). However, the decreases in property
crime (down 0.4 percent), robbery (down 2.9 percent) and arson (down 4.6
percent) weren't as great as the national average. Burglaries also rose 1.2
percent in the Midwest, according to the report.

The bad news is murder was up 0.6 percent in the Midwest, the only region out of
four where there was an increase.

The region that saw the largest drop in homicides, 6.1 percent, was the
Northeast, which the FBI defines as Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New
Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont, New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.

The area with the most significant drop in forcible rape, down 6.6 percent, was
the West: Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, Wyoming,
Alaska, California, Hawaii, Oregon and Washington.

Burglaries were up 3.2 percent in the Northeast, but down 1.2 percent in the
South: Delaware, the District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, North
Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, West Virgina, Alabama, Kentucky,
Mississippi, Tennessee, Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas.

Across the country, cities of 1 million or more saw a 4 percent decrease in
homicides. Cities of 50,000 to 99,999 saw a 14.4 percent drop in murders.

But in towns of 10,000 to 24,999, murders jumped 9.2 percent from 2010 to 2011.

And in towns of fewer than 10,000 people, homicides rocketed a staggering 18.3
percent.

Rocky Mountain States Resisting Move to Broaden Hate-Crime Laws

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

SECTION: Section A; Page 16; Column 2; National Desk

LENGTH: 825 words

DATELINE: DENVER, Feb. 4


Last fall, national revulsion over the killing of Matthew Shepard, a gay college
student in Wyoming, seemed strong enough to push legislatures in the Rockies to
expand hate-crime laws to include sexual orientation.

But this winter lawmakers in Colorado, Idaho, Montana and Utah have defeated
bills that would add sexual orientation to categories of people protected by
existing hate-crime laws. In Wyoming legislators have defeated all efforts to
pass that state's first hate-crime law.

In New Mexico, which has the region's lone Democratic-controlled legislature,
lawmakers are expected to pass a hate-crime bill that includes sexual
orientation. But Gov. Gary E. Johnson, a Republican, has vowed a veto, saying,
"All crimes are hate crimes."

Kerry Lobel, executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, a
Washington group that pushes for hate-crime legislation, said: "We are
incredibly disappointed. We looked to the Wyoming Legislature for leadership and
legislation, not lip service."

The votes came as the Federal Bureau of Investigation on Jan. 21 released its
latest tally of hate crimes. In 1997, sexual orientation was the motivation for
14 percent of reported hate crimes, or 1,102 crimes out of 8,049, the bureau
said. Under the bureau's voluntary reporting system, police departments covering
about 80 percent of the country's population report their hate crimes.

Forty states have some kind of hate-crime legislation, generally laws that
increase fines and add jail time for crimes motivated by hatred of a specific
group. Of those states, 19 have laws that specify sexual orientation as a
category for protection. Ten states, largely in the South and Southwest, do not
have any hate-crime legislation.

Outside the Rockies, legislatures in Hawaii, Oklahoma, and Virginia are
considering hate-crime bills that include sexual orientation.

Antipathy toward hate-crime legislation seems to stem from several factors,
including a belief that the laws would confer special rights on the groups named
and a backlash against publicity resulting from the Shepard killing.

Sally Vaughan, a resident of Remington, Wyo., complained two weeks ago at a
legislative hearing in Cheyenne about what she called "the vicious smear
campaign" by the national press in its coverage of Shepard killing. Wyoming
became the true victim of bias crime, Ms. Vaughan said.

Doug Thompson, who recently formed a Wyoming group called Citizens for Equal
Protection, urged lawmakers in Cheyenne to protect all citizens "and not just a
few groups who claim victim status."

Gov. Jim Geringer, a Republican, gave general support to a hate-crime bill but
also warned legislators about yielding to "external pressure."

In the end, a hate-crime bill that six weeks ago seemed destined for passage
died yesterday in the Senate Judiciary Committee.

"The part of the bill that made people the most uncomfortable was the provision
for sexual orientation," State Senator John C. Schiffer, a Republican who is the
committee chairman, said today, adding, "My feeling right now is that the
committee is tired of discussing bias crimes."

A Democratic member of the committee, Senator Rae Lynn Job, said, "A lot of
people felt that by passing this we were going to give some people more
protection than others."

In Montana, a bill to add sexual orientation to an existing hate-crime bill last
week died in committee. In its place, the State Senate passed a bill that would
allow a judge to increase penalties for a crime motivated by hate, but it did
not specify any protected groups.

"The language is over broad, vague, lacking in specific terms and will be
constitutionally challenged," State Senator Steve Doherty, a Democrat, said. "It
is nice-sounding fluff."

The campaign to add sexual orientation to the list of hate crimes has been
hampered by the reluctance of the Shepard family to allow their son to become a
martyr for a political cause.

"It's a very frightening concept as a parent that your son now becomes a martyr,
a public figure for the world," Mr. Shepard's mother, Judy Shepard, told
"Dateline NBC" in an interview that is to be broadcast on Friday night. "He's
just our son."

In December, Mrs. Shepard and her husband, Dennis, set up the Matthew Shepard
Foundation, saying in a statement, "The foundation will be dedicated to the
principle of helping people move beyond tolerance to embrace and rejoice in
diversity."

Last month, in Casper, Wyo., the family's hometown, Mrs. Shepard announced an
International Hike Against Hate and Violence to stretch 2,500 miles from
Skagway, Alaska, to Laramie, Wyo., this summer.

In an interview for the March issue of Vanity Fair, Mrs. Shepard described
Matthew as having the posture of a victim.

"He was the kind of person whom you just look at and know if you hurt him that
he's going to take it, that there's nothing he can do about it, verbally or
physically," she said.

Serious Crimes Fall for 8th Consecutive Year

BYLINE: AP

SECTION: Section A; Page 21; Column 4; National Desk

LENGTH: 543 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 7


Serious crimes reported to the police dropped in 1999 for an eighth consecutive
year, down 7 percent from the year before and the longest-running crime decline
on record, the Federal Bureau of Investigation reported today.

The bureau's preliminary figures for 1999 extended a trend that began in 1992
and that is now almost three times longer than the previous record decline, the
three years from 1982 to 1984. The F.B.I.'s crime records go back to 1960.

The nation's longest crime increase, from 1965 through 1969, came as baby
boomers reached the crime-prone ages of 15 to 25, said Prof. Alfred Blumstein of
Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.

Some experts pointed out that the current decrease in crime was slowing in the
nation's largest cities, calling it a reminder that crime rates could not go
down forever.

Big cities "are the leaders both on the way up and on the way down," Professor
Blumstein said.

In New York City, the number of reported homicides rose slightly in 1999, to 671
from 633 the year before.

The F.B.I. figures, reported by 17,000 police agencies across the country,
showed that all seven major types of crime were down in suburbs, rural areas and
cities of all sizes.

The violent crimes of homicide, rape, robbery and aggravated assault fell a
combined 7 percent, led by homicide and robbery, each down 8 percent. Rape and
assault were down 7 percent each.

The property crimes of burglary, auto theft and larceny-theft also decreased a
combined 7 percent, led by an 11 percent drop in burglaries. Auto theft was down
8 percent, and larceny-theft, 6 percent.

"Now is not the time, however, to become complacent," Attorney General Janet
Reno said. "Let's try harder. We must redouble our efforts by providing
alternatives to crime, as well as tough enforcement."

Both Democrats and Republicans pointed to anti-crime measures they had
championed.

President Clinton said the report "confirms that our anti-crime strategy -- more
police officers on the beat, fewer illegal guns and violent criminals on the
street -- is having a powerful impact."

Mr. Clinton pushed through funds for 100,000 more local police officers and
signed the Brady bill into law, requiring background checks for gun buyers.

Orrin G. Hatch, the Utah Republican who is chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, said the results "were largely due to the leadership at the state,
local and federal levels of Republicans committed to arresting, prosecuting and
incarcerating violent criminals."

Legislation backed by Republicans has provided $700 million a year for prison
construction, Mr. Hatch said.

Academic experts credited both parties' favorite anti-crime remedies but also
factors beyond their control, like the aging of baby boomers past crime-prone
years.

The F.B.I. report said homicide was down 2 percent in cities over 500,000, 7
percent to 14 percent in smaller cities, 12 percent in suburbs and 17 percent in
rural areas.

Over all, serious crimes dropped 10 percent in the West, 8 percent in the Middle
West, 7 percent in the Northeast and 4 percent in the South.

Crime was down 7 percent in rural areas, 8 percent in suburbs, 7 percent to 8
percent in cities under 500,000 and 6 percent in cities over 500,000.

Crime-Fighters Come To Town

FEDERAL AGENTS REASSIGNED TO TEAM UP WITH POLICE

By ELAINE SILVESTRINI and VALERIE KALFRIN

The Tampa Tribune

TAMPA -- The Justice Department on Thursday unveiled an initiative to attack
violent crime in 15 cities, including Tampa, but provided few specifics as to
how the plan will work or how the cities were selected.

It did say that two of Tampa's highest crime neighborhoods, Jackson Heights and
Sulphur Springs, will be the focus of Violent Crime Impact Teams led by agents
of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives working with other
federal agencies, as well as city police.

The teams will use "cutting-edge technology" and other federal resources to
identify and prosecute habitual, violent offenders.

U.S. Attorney Paul Perez said the program involves no extra federal money,
relying instead on moving existing resources.

A Justice Department news release said this initiative "has placed teams
consisting of ATF agents, U.S. marshals, DEA agents and federal prosecutors in
each selected city over the past several weeks."

Local federal officials said the program will mostly involve reassigning agents
and prosecutors already based in Tampa.

ATF spokesman Carlos Baixauli said two ATF agents will be temporarily
transferred from other areas of the country. They will work with two local
enforcement groups consisting of at least 10 agents each who are being taken off
their normal duties.

Federal agents have been at work with the Tampa Police Department's street-level
antidrug squads for more than a month, Police Chief Stephen Hogue said. They
have helped with narcotics investigations and elected to prosecute several of
those arrested through the federal courts.

"Where we can get the most bang for our buck is where they'll be prosecuted,"
Hogue said.

The initiative was announced Thursday morning in Washington by U.S. Attorney
General John Ashcroft. A news conference held by local federal and city
officials in Tampa followed.

"We are determined to drive down violent crime everywhere," Ashcroft said,
"especially in those places where habitual offenders are concentrated and
communities live in fear of the violent and predatory."

He said the 15 cities were selected on the basis of violent crime statistics and
other factors.

"In each city, they looked at a number of things, including the violent crime
and homicide rates," said Justice Department spokesman Michael Kulstad. "They
also looked at cities where they felt they could make the biggest difference.
And that's kind of an arbitrary thing to explain, but those are the things they
looked at."

In addition to Tampa, the cities identified for the initiative are: Albuquerque,
N.M.; Baltimore; Chattanooga, Tenn.; Miami; Richmond, Va.; Greensboro, N.C.;
Tulsa, Okla.; Pittsburgh; Las Vegas; Columbus, Ohio; Philadelphia; Los Angeles;
Tucson, Ariz.; and the Washington, D.C./Northern Virginia region.

Ten of the cities selected for the initiative are in states expected to play
important roles in the presidential election, and questions of political motives
are bound to arise in an election year.

"I don't think there's any connection," Perez said.

According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, violent crime has declined
steadily nationwide since 1994. There were 22.8 violent crimes per 1,000 people
older than 12 reported in 2002, a decline of 7.7 percent from the year before,
records show.

Tampa's reported violent crime has declined at a similar rate, according to FBI
statistics. There were 19.82 violent crimes per 1,000 people in the city in
2002, a decline of 6.7 percent from 2001. Estimated figures for 2003 show 18.05
violent crimes per 1,000 people, a decline of 8.9 percent.

Of the 15 cities involved in the initiative, Tampa had the second-highest
violent crime rate in 2002, behind Baltimore. Other cities with high rates, such
as Detroit and Atlanta, were not included in the program.

The FBI defines violent crimes as murder, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated
assault.

Authorities said the initiative will last six months.

Hogue was invited but couldn't attend the ATF news conference, saying he was
scheduled for state-mandated training.

Ralph Ostrowski, special agent in charge of the Tampa ATF, was out of town and
did not attend.

Hogue said he met with federal investigators, the U.S. attorney's office and the
state attorney's office months ago to discuss the initiative.

"We met all the players, but they haven't rolled out all the details yet," he
said.

The police department is not receiving extra money from the program, Hogue said.

Federal officials approached Tampa months ago about the initiative. "I'm not
sure what their criteria was, but I'm glad they did," Hogue said. "I appreciate
all the help I can get. I'll take all the people they want to send here."

Tampa Neighborhood Watch Association President Marilyn Durst suggested
authorities should inform residents about "what they're doing and why now,
because those questions will arise."

"I think we have a tremendous need to be a little more creative and forceful in
addressing our crime issues," she said. "Any help we can get to address violent
crime and persistent violent crime is a good thing."

Mayor Pam Iorio said she wasn't worried about the negative attention that could
come from Tampa making the government's list of targeted cities.

"I'm not concerned about the image. I'm concerned about the reality," Iorio
said. "We look at the sheer numbers and we say, 'We can do better.' "

Bay Area Had Fewer Violent Crimes In '06

BYLINE: VALERIE KALFRIN, The Tampa Tribune

SECTION: METRO; Pg. 4

LENGTH: 636 words


NUMBER OFF 18% IN TAMPA, 4% IN ST. PETE

By VALERIE KALFRIN

The Tampa Tribune

TAMPA - The latest federal crime statistics and a criminologist's independent
analysis offer some good news about violent crime in the Bay area.

According to the FBI's annual Uniform Crime Report, released Monday, there were
fewer violent crimes reported in Tampa, St. Petersburg and Clearwater last year
compared with all of 2005.

The area's crime rate also ranks comparatively low when calculated using
population.

The FBI each year collects information about seven violent and property crimes
from participating law enforcement agencies nationwide. The violent crimes are
murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, rape, aggravated assault and robbery. The
property crimes are burglary, larceny and auto theft.

The federal crime report shows the number of violent crimes dropped 18 percent
in Tampa, 4 percent in St. Petersburg and 13 percent in Clearwater last year.

Criminology professor Richard Rosenfeld of the University of Missouri-St. Louis
placed the crime drop into a larger context. Rosenfeld and other criminologists
released their rankings Tuesday of 300 metropolitan statistical areas and
violent crime rates, calculated from the number of crimes per 100,000 residents.

On the list, the Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater area ranks 37th out of 300, or
in the top 12 percent, with 709.2 violent crimes per 100,000 people. This area
also includes Largo.

In sheer population size, however, this area ties Baltimore-Towson, Md., as the
15th largest, with 2.7 million people.

On Rosenfeld's ranking, the Memphis, Tenn., area has the highest violent crime
rate per 100,000 residents. Gainesville ranked seventh. Orlando-Kissimmee tied
at 13th. Tallahassee ranked 26th. Panama City-Lynn Haven ranked 29th, and
Miami-Fort Lauderdale-Miami Beach ranked 31st.

The full list is available at www.crimetrends.com/id4.html.

Rosenfeld said he prefers to compare areas from the FBI's report instead of
individual cities because the larger areas include suburban populations.

Rosenfeld and his colleagues also adjusted the homicide rates of 65 cities,
including Tampa and St. Petersburg, based on these crime-influencing factors:
unemployment, poverty, racial composition and female-headed households.

With the adjusted ranking, Tampa has fewer homicides "than one might expect
given the conditions there," and St. Petersburg has just what the criminologists
expected, Rosenfeld said.

According to the FBI's report, the rate of violent crime nationwide rose for the
second straight year. It is the third-lowest total in the past two decades.

Local cities showed increases among individual categories of violent crime.

Tampa had 25 homicides last year, compared with 20 the previous year, the
statistics show.

The number of homicides dropped in St. Petersburg, from 30 in 2005 to 21 in
2006, and in Clearwater, from nine in 2005 to four in 2006.

Tampa and St. Petersburg each recorded an increase in robberies, 4 percent in
Tampa and 7 percent in St. Petersburg.

St. Petersburg also recorded a 10 percent increase in the number of rapes.

The FBI statistics do not match exactly the statistics released this year by the
Tampa police because of classification differences in two categories.

The Tampa police Web site reports in 2006 there were 158 sexual batteries -
which include rape, sodomy and fondling - and 2,445 aggravated assaults.

The FBI classifies sodomy and fondling as "aggravated assault," so the federal
agency's statistics show 133 rapes reported in Tampa and 2,470 aggravated
assaults, a police spokeswoman said.

Data Hint Crime Plunge May Be Leveling Off

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD

SECTION: Section A; Page 22; Column 4; National Desk

LENGTH: 463 words


Serious crime declined in the first six months of 2000 compared with the same
period in 1999, but only by three-tenths of 1 percent, the smallest decrease
since the nation's crime rate began falling in 1992, according to a report
released yesterday by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

The report also found that while the number of murders fell 1.8 percent
nationwide in the first half of the year, many cities, led by New York, Los
Angeles, Dallas and New Orleans, had an increase in murders for the first time
since the early 1990's.

The statistics raised some concern among law enforcement officials and
criminologists that the enormous crime drop of the past eight years might be
ending. "We seem to have hit bottom," said James Alan Fox, the Lipman Family
professor of criminal justice at Northeastern University in Boston.

"To some extent, we are victims of our own success," Professor Fox said. "With
eight straight years of declining crime rates, we are at a level that is
difficult to continue and certainly hard to improve upon."

Since 1991, when serious and violent crime peaked, the drop in the crime rates
has averaged about 7 percent a year. So the three-tenths of 1 percent decline
for the six-month period seems particularly small, several experts said.

But they cautioned that a half-year was too short a period to draw firm
conclusions, and that some of the figures in the report were fragmentary and
contradictory. Also, virtually all the measures that contributed to the drop in
crime are still in place: more criminals in prison, innovative police
strategies, intense community efforts to work with troubled young people, a
waning of the crack cocaine epidemic and a strong economy providing more jobs in
poor neighborhoods.

The bureau's report, known as the Uniform Crime Report, is based on arrest
figures supplied by local police forces and measures four violent crimes --
murder, robbery, rape and aggravated assault -- and four property crimes --
burglary, petty theft, motor vehicle theft and arson. It does not include drug
arrests.

While murder was down 1.8 percent in the first half of 2000 and robbery was down
2.6 percent, rape and aggravated assault were both up seven-tenths of 1 percent.
Burglary decreased 2.4 percent in the first six months, and arson was down 2.7
percent, but petty theft was up one-tenth of 1 percent and motor vehicle theft
was up 1.2 percent. Crime fell in the Northeast, the Midwest and the West but
rose in the South by 1.2 percent.

Among those cities with more murders in the first six months of 2000 were New
York, with 344, compared with 335 in the first half of 1999; Los Angeles, with
247, up from 196; Dallas, with 115, compared with 88, and New Orleans with 117,
up from 86.

VIOLENT CRIME IS BELOW AVERAGE

BYLINE: By Jeremy Craig Staff Writer

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B01

LENGTH: 334 words


Augusta is a safer city for residents than Savannah or Valdosta, but violent
crime did increase slightly last year, according to FBI reports released this
week.

In its newest annual report, the FBI reported that violent crime nationwide was
down 3 percent in 2003 from 2002, with about 475 violent crimes per 100,000
people.

The rate for the Augusta metropolitan statistical area (MSA) - which includes
Burke, Columbia, Richmond, Aiken and Edgefield counties - was about 390, lower
than the national average.

However, the rate was about 315 in 2002, and 342 in 2001, FBI data show.

FBI statistics for years before 2003 do not include Burke County as part of the
Augusta metro area.

Violent crime rates factor in reported murders, rapes, robberies and aggravated
assaults.

Augusta's violent crime rate was at the lower end for Georgia.

The highest rates in the Peach State were recorded in Rome and Savannah, with
about 558 violent crimes per 100,000 people.

The Atlanta metro area - home to more than 4.5 million people - had a rate of
about 513.

Property crimes in the Augusta region were above the national average, and
figures dropped less than 1 percent from 2002 to 2003.

The national average is 3,588 for 2003. Augusta's rate is 4,072.

Macon led Georgia, with a property crime rate of 6,078.

East of the Savannah River, some South Carolina metro areas had higher crime
rates than any metro area in Georgia.

In South Carolina, the highest violent crime rate was in the Florence area.

Even though the entire Florence metro area had roughly the population of
Richmond County alone in 2003 - just less than 200,000 people - the FBI showed
about 1,045 violent crimes per 100,000 people.

The metro area with the lowest violent crime rate in the state was Greenville,
with 606 violent crimes per 100,000 people.

The highest property crime rate in the Palmetto State was in the Myrtle Beach
area, with about 7,440 property crimes per 100,000 people.

Violent Crime Declines 8 Percent in Big Cities

BYLINE: AP

SECTION: Section 1;  Page 25;  Column 1;  National Desk

LENGTH: 453 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 12


Violent crime in large cities dropped 8 percent in 1995, leading the way for a
smaller decline across the nation, the Federal Bureau of Investigation reported
today.

The bureau's annual crime survey also showed the lowest murder rate in a decade
in 1995 and the lowest overall rate of violent crime since 1989.

The survey was compiled from crimes reported to more than 16,000 law-enforcement
agencies covering 95 percent of the nation's population. In May, the bureau
released preliminary figures indicating the declines.

With crime an issue in the Presidential campaign, President Clinton quickly
claimed credit for the decrease.

He said in a statement, "Our anticrime strategy -- to put more police on the
street while working to get drugs, gangs and guns out of our neighborhoods -- is
working."

The President cautioned, however, that the nation still "must bear down even
harder on violent juvenile crime."

Christina Martin, campaign spokeswoman for Bob Dole, the Republican Presidential
candidate, said, "Clinton's words of self-congratulation are a shallow attempt
to divert attention from the massive increase in teen drug use under his watch."

Attorney General Janet Reno attributed the improvement to "many different
causes, including our bipartisan efforts to give local law enforcement the tools
they need to combat crime."

But she warned: "This is no time to rest on our laurels. Crime is still too
high."

The findings for 1995 showed an 8 percent drop in violent crimes for a second
consecutive year in the cities with populations of more than one million:
Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia, Phoenix and San
Diego.

Violent crimes include murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault.

Nationally, the number of violent crimes dropped 3 percent as the rate of
violent crimes per 100,000 population declined 4 percent. The number of crimes
covered in the F.B.I.'s reporting system was 13.9 million in 1995, representing
5,278 offenses for every 100,000 inhabitants.

The number of reported crimes of all types was down 1 percent from a year
earlier, while the crime rate declined 2 percent per 100,000, the study said.

There were 21,597 murders reported in 1995, 7 percent lower than 1994 and 13
percent below 1991. The murder rate was 8 per 100,000 population. Forty-nine
percent of the victims were black and 48 percent white.

Fifty-five percent of those murdered were slain by strangers or unknown persons.
Among the women murdered, 26 percent were slain by husbands or boyfriends. Wives
or girlfriends killed 3 percent of the men murdered.

The 97,464 forcible rapes reported to law enforcement, the fewest since 1989,
represented a 5 percent drop.

Logan, Danville make high-crime list

BYLINE: Rusty Marks, Staff writer

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. P1B

LENGTH: 495 words


Full list of the top 15 towns, 5B

TOP 15 FOR PROPERTY CRIMES

The 15 towns where residents are most likely to be victims of property crimes,
according to NeighborhoodScout.com:

1. Island Vista, Calif.

2. Logan, W.Va.

3. Schofield Barracks, Hawaii

4. Huntsville, Ala.

5. Oklahoma City

6. Austin, Texas

7. St. Louis

8. St. Petersburg, Fla.

9. Seattle

10. Berkeley, Calif.

11 and 12. Columbus, Ohio

13. Danville, W.Va.

14. Memphis, Tenn.

15. Portland, Ore.

Don't leave your purse unattended in Logan or Danville.

According to a recent study by researchers for online search engine
NeighborhoodScout.com, both Southern West Virginia towns are on the list of
places you're most likely to have your house or car broken into.

Researchers used data from 17,000 law enforcement agencies and FBI crime data to
compare crime rates in 60,000 neighborhoods around the United States. They then
used the information to determine the top 15 cities where residents are most
likely to be victims of property crimes - car thefts, break-ins and burglaries.

The Web site is designed to help homebuyers find out more about areas where they
might be moving and buying a house.

According to their research, Logan is the second most likely location to be the
victim of a property crime. Isla Vista, Calif., was first on the list.

Danville, in Boone County, came in at No. 13, ahead of Memphis, Tenn., and
Portland, Ore. Other towns where residents are likely to be separated from their
worldly goods include Huntsville, Ala.; Austin, Texas; and Seattle. Two
neighborhoods in Columbus, Ohio, came in at No.11 and No. 12 on the list.

If the Web site's information is correct, residents of the two zip codes that
make up the Logan area have a one in one chance of being a crime victim over the
course of a year, making a robbery or burglary practically a sure thing.
Residents of the three zip codes that make up Danville and the surrounding area
have a 50-50 chance of being crime victims.

Andrew Schiller, founder and chief executive officer of NeighborhoodScout.com,
said the listings were not based on the overall number of property crimes, but
on the comparative crime rates of different communities. "This was not looking
at violent crime," Schiller said.

The ZIP code areas studied by researchers go well beyond Danville and Logan city
limits to take in large portions of Boone and Logan counties. Schiller said the
area included in the Danville statistics is made up of 4,357 people, while the
Logan area comprises 1,072.

The news might not be all bad for Web-browsers thinking about moving to West
Virginia on a whim. In another study, NeighborhoodScout.com researchers
determined that Wheeling is 15th on a list of the 100 safest cities with
populations over 25,000.

Schiller said he has gone whitewater rafting in West Virginia and has friends
who went to Marshall University.

"West Virginia is a beautiful state," he said. "I've been there numerous times."

Crime Rate in New York City Fell 8 Percent in Early '99, F.B.I. Says

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN

SECTION: Section B; Page 5; Column 3; Metropolitan Desk

LENGTH: 433 words


Despite an uptick in the homicide rate, New York City's overall crime rate fell
by 8 percent during the first six months of the year, compared with the same
period last year, according to preliminary figures released yesterday by the
F.B.I.

The drop showed New York City slightly behind the national decrease of about 10
percent in the overall crime rate. Both New York City and the nation showed an 8
percent drop in violent crimes -- homicides, rapes, robberies and aggravated
assaults.

The city showed a sharper drop in crime than the average for the seven other
cities with populations of more than 1 million people. The rate for violent
crimes and for crimes over all for all eight big cities, including New York,
fell by 6 percent.

Within the metropolitan region, however, New York City's smaller neighbors
tended to show steeper drops in crime than New York City did, an analysis of the
F.B.I.'s figures showed.

The 11 cities in the New York region with populations over 100,000, taken as a
whole, showed a 15 percent drop in the violent crime rate, compared with New
York City's 8 percent drop.

During the first sixth months of last year, New York City was the
sixth-least-violent city in the region. This year it was seventh, after
Hartford, which saw a 23 percent drop in violent crimes during the first six
months of this year.

Alfred Blumstein, a professor of urban systems and operations research at
Carnegie Mellon University, said that the steeper decreases in the cities
surrounding New York could be a sign that New York City is reaching the point of
diminishing returns in its remarkably successful battle against crime.

"Given that New York City was one of the first places where the decline started,
and where it has been particularly steep," Professor Blumstein said, "it has got
to, at some point, level off."

Homicides in New York City jumped 14 percent during the first half of this year,
to 341 from 299. In the 11 cities outside New York for which the F.B.I. released
statistics, homicides also increased, about 12 percent, to 100 from 89.

The 11 cities in the region for which statistics were available were Albany and
Yonkers; Newark, Jersey City, Elizabeth and Paterson, N.J.; and Bridgeport,
Hartford, New Haven, Stamford and Waterbury, Conn.

Of those cities, New Haven had the highest overall crime rate and Newark the
highest violent crime rate. Stamford had the lowest violent crime rate, while
Yonkers had the lowest crime rate over all.

New York City had the third lowest overall crime rate in the region, after
Yonkers and Stamford.

Irvine crime rate sixth-lowest in nation, says FBI

BYLINE: By Jeff Collins , For Irvine World News

SECTION: IRVINENEWS

LENGTH: 411 words


Irvine had the sixth-lowest crime rate among large cities throughout the nation
last year, according to FBI preliminary figures released last week.

It takes more than police to cut crime, said Police Chief Dave Maggard.

Citizens play an important part. So do politicians.

``All of those things in combination contribute to a safe standard and a very
high quality of life,'' Maggard said. ``It's not just the police department that
keeps crime low.''

It's that combination that has kept Irvine and Huntington Beach among the
nation's 10 safest big cities for more than a decade, according to Maggard and
Kenneth Small, his Surf City counterpart.

Huntington Beach had the eighth-lowest rate for communities with 100,000 or
more, according to the crime figures released last week.

The Orange County Register calculated the rankings based on the FBI's
preliminary 2003 report of ``index'' crimes, such as murder, rape, robbery,
burglary and auto theft.

The report included crime statistics for 228 of the nation's biggest cities.

In all, seven of Orange County's eight biggest municipalities were among the top
40 safest cities in the country.

Mayor Larry Agran said his city's continued investment in public safety is
paying dividends.

Under the latest initiative, the Police Department assigns teams of officers to
specific regions in town.

That reinforces the connection between citizens and officers, Agran said, which
in turn, results in more effective law enforcement.

The result: ``People can walk their neighborhoods any time of day or night,''
Agran said.

Most Southern California metropolitan areas ranked in the lower half of U.S.
cities in 2003: Long Beach ranked 55th; San Diego, 69th; Los Angeles, 82nd; and
Riverside, 97th.

San Bernardino's crime rate ranked 50th from the bottom at 178, the figures
show.

The 10 highest crime rates were mainly in Southern and Midwestern cities: St.
Louis, Mo.; Little Rock, Ark.; Atlanta, Ga.; Tampa, Fla.; Orlando, Fla.; Tucson,
Ariz.; Memphis, Tenn.; Oklahoma City; Macon, Ga.; and Salt Lake City.

F.B.I. Says Crime in Northeast Fell 8 Percent in First Half of '93

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 5


Crime in the Northeast declined 8 percent this year, the highest drop of any
region, the Federal Bureau of Investigation reported today.

Across the country, violent crime during the first six months of 1993 fell 3
percent from the same period in 1992, while the number of property crimes
dropped by 5 percent, according to preliminary findings of the F.B.I.'s Uniform
Crime Reporting program.

In New York State, serious crimes reported to the police decreased 5.9 percent
during the first six months of the year. If the pattern holds, 1993 will be the
third consecutive year of declining crime in the state, the report said.

New York City saw a 5.6 percent drop in reported crimes, while upstate New York
saw a 6.8 percent decline.

In New Jersey, crime in the four largest cities also dropped, the F.B.I.
reported.

The four cities with populations of at least 100,000 recorded a total of 36,821
violent or property crimes, plus another 179 cases of arson, from January to
June of this year. That compares with 40,879 crimes and 173 cases of arson from
January through June 1992.

"The small reported declines may be positive, but I doubt most Americans will
draw much comfort from them because the levels of violent crimes and drug
trafficking remain so staggering," said the F.B.I. Director, Louis Freeh.

Reported crimes declined 7 percent in the Middle West, 4 percent in the South
and 2 percent in the West.

Overall, New York State experienced declines in every major crime category,
including a 5 percent drop in violent crime, a 1 percent drop in homicide, a 1.2
percent drop in rape, a 6.3 percent drop in robbery, a 7.5 percent drop in
burglary and a 9 percent drop in car theft.

New York City reported a slight increase in forcible rape, 1.4 percent, but
crime in every other category fell. For upstate New York, there were declines in
every category except homicide, which jumped 12 percent, from 117 to 131.

In Newark, reported crimes dropped by 2,841 incidents, or 13.7 percent, to
17,896, the F.B.I. said. In Jersey City, a decline of 1,657 crimes to 8,712
incidents translated into a 15.9 percent decline, while the 193 fewer crimes in
Elizabeth, down to 4,646, accounted for a drop of 3.9 percent.

But Paterson offered an anomaly.

Crime there rose by 633 incidents, or 12.9 percent, to 5,567, driven principally
by 584 additional cases of burglary and a mixture of more robberies, aggravated
assaults and larceny-thefts. Arson, tallied separately, also increased.

Crime statistics show violence down in traditional American big-city areas

BYLINE: JONATHAN FREEDLAND; THE GUARDIAN

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. D11

DATELINE: WASHINGTON


New York, Washington and Los Angeles breathed a sigh of relief Monday after FBI
figures revealed that none of them is America's most crime-ridden city.

Newark, New Jersey, had the highest rate for violent crimes. Newark, an
industrial city, had 19.3 cases of homicide, rape, aggravated assault and
robbery per thousand residents. Close behind are St. Louis and Atlanta, venue of
the 1996 Olympic Games.

New York's exclusion from the crime Top 25 was a one of several surprises in the
FBI statistics, which included evidence that although random killings are up,
overall U.S. crime is down.

Tourists will note that Florida has two places in the crime Top 10, Miami and
Tampa, at Numbers Four and Five respectively. Embarrassingly for President Bill
Clinton, his home town, Little Rock, Arkansas, is Number Six.

Big Apple less rotten

New York officials celebrated the city's FBI ranking as America's 27th-most
criminal city. Mayor Rudolph Guiliani said tourists should come to the Big Apple
without fear. Los Angeles -- notorious for drive-by shootings and drug gangs --
showed a 15-per-cent drop in violent crime, making it Number 20.

The cities stack up somewhat differently when the rates are studied for
homicides alone. Gary, a suburb of Chicago, was the most murderous city, with 89
homicides for every 100,00 people. New Orleans was next, closely followed by
Washington with 78.

Nationally, violent crime was down four per cent on the previous year. Yet fear
of crime is rising, and a growing number of Americans are arming themselves for
the first time.

"I think it's good news overall, but there's bad news hidden within," said James
Alan Fox, dean of criminal justice at Northeastern University in Boston.

New trends

The numbers, he said, "obscure the fact that there are two opposite crime trends
going on: The baby boomers are getting older and less violent, and the young are
getting more ruthless.

"The violent crime rate among adults has been dropping," he said, but "the rate
of violence among juveniles has been skyrocketing. The overall numbers that we
see here do not reflect that at all."

Of the 24,526 murders in the U.S. in 1993, 53 per cent were committed by
assailants unknown to their victims. Until now, most homicides were the work of
relatives or friends. The result is that, even if crime rates are falling, most
people fear violence more.

The now random nature of the crime gave every American a realistic chance of
becoming a murder victim, the FBI study said.

Hate Crime Reporting Uneven;
Miss. Cites None, Following Trend In Much of South

BYLINE: Darryl Fears; Washington Post Staff Writer

SECTION: A-SECTION; Pg. A03

LENGTH: 540 words


The FBI released its yearly hate crime statistics yesterday, showing that more
than 9,000 offenses were committed  because of race, ethnicity, religion, sexual
orientation or  physical or  mental disability last year, an 8 percent increase
over the year before.

But the report came under criticism because of wide discrepancies in the numbers
reported by the states.

California reported the most hate crimes -- 1,604. New Jersey and Michigan
reported 1,541 hate crimes combined. Virginia reported 389 hate crimes, a high
among Southern states, and Maryland reported 218. One city reported more hate
crimes than at least 10 states: Washington, with 64.

Northern states reported hundreds more hate crimes than Southern states, despite
the South's troubled racial history and the fact that most of the victims of
hate crimes were black. Georgia, Kentucky and North Carolina reported  fewer
than 230 hate crimes combined. Louisiana, where civil rights protesters marched
in Jena, a rural town  where nooses were hung on a tree last year, reported 27
-- seven more than Rhode Island. Alabama reported one hate crime; Mississippi
zero.

Heidi Beirich,  director of research and special projects for the Southern
Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala.,  which studies hate groups, said many
states are dismissive of hate crimes.

"I would say Southern states are the absolute worst," Beirich said. "You have
states like California and New Jersey that report hundreds of hate crimes --
because they do a good job."

Alabama, she said, does not consider crimes linked to sexual orientation  to be
hate crimes. "That's one example of why hate crime statistics are basically a
worthless number. It's not the FBI's fault."

"I really don't have an explanation for the discrepancy because it's really a
voluntary reporting system," said Steve Fischer, an FBI spokesman. "There's no
mandate from the FBI that states have to participate."

The scope of hate crimes appears to be larger than the 2006 statistics show, as
indicated in a November 2005 special report by the Justice Department.

In  "Hate Crimes Reported by Victims and Police," an article based on the
National Criminal Victimization Survey and Uniform Crime Reporting, statistician
Caroline Wolf Harlow said the nation had an annual average of 210,000 hate
crimes between July 2000 and December 2003. About 92,000 crimes were reported to
police, Harlow wrote.

An ordinary crime becomes a hate crime when  a perpetrator chooses a victim
because of a particular characteristic, Harlow wrote. It can be  skin color,
sexual orientation, physical disability or religion. And there must be evidence
that   hate prompted the crime.

According to the FBI's latest report, most people who commit hate crimes are
white -- about 59 percent. Twenty percent are black.

In incidents involving racial bias alone, blacks represented  66 percent of the
victims, the report said. Jews were more often the victims of religious
violence, at 65 percent. Hispanics were more likely to be the targets of ethnic
crimes, at 63 percent, and gay men, at 62 percent, were the most common victims
of attacks related  to sexual orientation.

"It's great that they collect this data," Beirich said, "but it doesn't tell you
a whole heck of a lot."

Policy brief focuses on violent crime in Buffalo

BYLINE: Daily Record Staff

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 539  words


Buffalo has fewer police officers per capita than many other cities in New York
and nearby states, a condition reinforced by a 13 percent drop in officers per
capita between 2000 and 2005, according to the most recently released Regional
Institute Policy Brief, "Violent Crime in the City of Good Neighbors. " This is
especially noteworthy given the city's relatively high violent-crime rate, which
in 2005 exceeded that of Syracuse, Rochester and New York City. According to the
brief's comparison of officer and crime levels in northeast and midwest cities
with 150,000 or more residents, Buffalo is one of only a few cities to have both
a higher violent-crime rate and lower officer levels than the group average.

Regional Institute Director Kathryn A. Foster noted, however, that Buffalo's
higher-than-average violent-crime rate is not necessarily the result of its
lower-than-average officer levels. "This analysis indicates that cities with
violent-crime rates similar to Buffalo's tend to have more officers," she said,
adding that officer levels often reflect a city's crime rate, not vice versa.
"In the group of cities we examined, the tendency is low officer levels in
cities with low violent-crime rates and high officer levels in cities with high
violent-crime rates. " Buffalo is not an anomaly with regards to its shrinking
officer levels. Between 2000 and 2005, many cities reduced their police forces
to cope with limited resources. In Detroit, where the violent-crime rate is 70
percent higher than in Buffalo, police levels fell by almost 15 percent.
However, other major cities in upstate New York added to their officer levels,
including a five percent jump in Syracuse. With respect to changes in violent-
crime levels, Buffalo mirrors most major cities in the midwest. After steady
declines during the 1990s, violent-crime rates have risen gradually in mid-sized
cities like Buffalo. During the first five years of this decade, violent crime
in Buffalo increased 11 percent, 11 percent in Cleveland, 7 percent in Detroit
and Pittsburgh, and 6 percent in St. Louis. Very large cities such as New York
City and Chicago have been bucking this trend, with their violent-crime levels
falling sharply through the 1990s and steadily through 2005. "Crime is a very
complex issue and experts have had a difficult time pinpointing the sources of
recent declines and increases in violent crime," said Peter A. Lombardi,
institute policy analyst and Policy Brief author, adding that demand for certain
narcotics, unemployment levels and law enforcement tactics are among the many
factors believed to influence violent-crime rates. "Consequently, and
appropriately, municipalities often pursue multi-pronged strategies to prevent
and prosecute crime," Lombardi said. This was apparent in Buffalo Mayor Byron
Brown's 2007 State of the City Address, in which he proposed tactics ranging
from a gun buyback program to increasing police presence citywide. "Violent
Crime in the City of Good Neighbors" is the institute's seventh brief since it
initiated the Policy Brief series in August 2006 to inform regional issues with
timely, reliable data and analysis. The series is available online at

Reported Hate Crimes On the Rise; Blacks Are Targeted Most, Records Show

SECTION: A SECTION; Pg. A10

LENGTH: 508 words

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Aug. 6



Reported hate crimes are on the rise in the United States, and African Americans
continue to be victims of such acts more often than any other group, experts
said today.

A review of federal crime records indicates that from 1991 to 1997, 40 percent
of hate crimes were committed against African Americans, 15 to 20 percent
involved religious targets, 9 to 14 percent gays, 5 percent Asians or Latinos,
and less than 1 percent Native Americans or the disabled.

Hate crimes against Latinos, however, appear to be on the rise, said Valerie
Jenness of the University of California at Irvine, one of several experts who
briefed reporters on the situation at the annual meeting of the American
Sociological Association.

"We've had a documented, reported rise [in hate crime statistics], but we don't
know if that's an actual rise or one caused by increased reporting," Jenness
said.

However, it would be "absolutely fair" to assume that more such crime occurs
than is recorded in the federal government's official crime reports, because not
all acts are reported by victims, she said. Experts also have long criticized
some law enforcement agencies for not properly documenting hate crimes.

Hate crimes account for only a fraction of 1 percent of all offenses reported in
the United States.

Most of those committing such crimes, Jenness said, "are not members of any
organized hate groups" but tend to be young white men, acting in informal groups
where the victims are usually outnumbered.

Abby Ferber of the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs reported that
white supremacist groups are increasingly turning to the Internet to recruit
members, though it appears that many more young white men read the literature
found there and elsewhere than actually join such groups.

Last year there were 537 active white supremacist groups identified in the
United States, with a membership of up to 200,000 in all, she said.

Benjamin Smith, 21, who grew up in a prosperous suburb of Chicago, had ties to
the World Church of the Creator, a white racist group based in East Peoria, Ill.
Smith's two-day shooting rampage last month targeted blacks, Jews and Asians in
Illinois and Indiana and left two men dead and nine others wounded.

Benjamin Matthew Williams, 31, and James Tyler Williams, 29, two brothers from
Northern California who were charged with murder last month in the deaths of a
gay couple and are suspects in arsons at three Sacramento area synagogues, also
had links to the World Church of the Creator, authorities said. Investigators
also found hate literature published by other white racist groups in the
brothers' home.

The appeal of groups such as the World Church of the Creator, Ferber said, is to
young white men who fear they will never do as well as their parents did
economically and for whom "the American dream seems like an impossibility."

As a result, some young white men face a "crisis of masculinity" and are
attracted to hate groups by the promise of regaining power, she said.

DROP IN NY CRIME BAFFLES EXPERTS;
The fear of violence persists despite the statistics, writes Clifford Krauss

BYLINE: Clifford Krauss

SECTION: THE GUARDIAN FOREIGN PAGE; Pg. 6

LENGTH: 947 words


BEHIND the bloodcurdling headlines crime in New York City is dropping. And
dropping fast.

Murders, which had been falling gradually over the previous three years, dropped
sharply, by nearly a fifth, last year.  Overall, 350 fewer people were killed in
1994 than in the year before, and 650 fewer than in 1990, when murders - many of
them fuelled by the crack epidemic - reached a peak.

Shootings dropped by more than 15 per cent, police statistics show. And almost
every type of reported felony declined in frequency last year, with car thefts,
grand larceny, burglary and robbery all dropping by more than 10 per cent.

Violent crime remains a constant menace.  The nearly 1,600 homicides committed
in 1994 are still about four times the 390 killings the city recorded in 1960.
And most crimes are committed by teenagers.

But coming after the staggering increases in crime through the late 1980s, - a
period that culminated in mid-1990 with senseless killings and the tabloid
headline plea to the mayor, David Dinkins, to "Do Something, Dave" - the latest
figures show a surprising reversal.

The changes are mirrored in many cities across the country. Overall, 22 of the
country's largest cities have reported at least modest declines in felony crime
this year - with San Francisco, Seattle, Los Angeles, El Paso, Texas, and San
Antonio, Texas, reporting even steeper drops than New York for the first six
months.

Per capita, many of those cities still have worse crime problems than New York.
In the first half of 1994, New York ranked 22nd in reported crime, falling from
18th in the same period the year before.

Criminologists offer a number of theories - intensified police efforts,
demographic shifts, a growing number of criminals behind bars - but no single
explanation.

"It's possible it is due to a fluctuation in the age of the population with
fewer people in the crime-committing ages of 16 to 23," said Joan McCord, a
Temple University criminologist.

"It's possible that the increasing concern people are showing about crime is
helping to define better values, as people speak more loudly on the issue.  As
far as advances in policing go, there are so many experiments around the country
that it's hard to tell which ones are effective."

But even in places with big declines in crime, or those where crime has not been
a problem for years, there is disbelief that the situation is improving. Brigid
McGinn, aged 33, a Brooklyn graduate student, still worries about her family's
safety, even though her tree-lined block in the Park Slope section of Brooklyn
did not record a single violent crime in 1994.

"I'm still very much on guard when I walk out the door," said Ms McGinn, who has
two young children.  "Maybe I'm beginning to feel safer, but it's harder to take
down your guard when it's been up so long."

Some sociologists and criminologists say many people's fears stem less from the
numbers of crimes committed and more from the types of crimes and their
viciousness - particularly teenage crime.

Experts note that while crimes committed by people over the age of 35 are
plunging, teenage crime remains high. And those crimes are more unpredictable
than those committed by older criminals.

Violent crimes down nationally but up in some Utah cities

BYLINE: By Nate Carlisle The Salt Lake Tribune

SECTION: NEWS; State

LENGTH: 571 words


The FBI on Monday released preliminary data showing violent crime in the western
United States, which includes Utah, decreased by 5.8 percent last year while
property crimes took a 2.5 percent dip.

The agency has not yet released statewide crime data for Utah, but it released
statistics for the state's four cities with populations of at least 100,000.

Violent crime was stagnant in Salt Lake City, and property crime declined 4.7
percent.

The state's second-most populous city, West Valley City, had a 5.1 percent
increase in violent crime, but property crimes dropped 8.3 percent.

West Jordan had a 51 percent increase in violent crime from 169 in 2009 to 255
in 2010. But property crimes declined 14.9 percent. West Jordan's per capita
violent crime rate remains much lower than Salt Lake City and West Valley City.

West Jordan Police Sgt. Drew Sanders said the increase may reflect changes in
recent years to the departments reporting system.

"We've worked to get it to reflect better what's actually occurring," Sanders
said. For example, he said the department previously categorized incidents by
the topic of the initial complaint. However, an officer who investigates a
report of an unruly teen may find evidence of an assault, a sex crime or another
violent offense.

"Before, they might have just reported it as an 'ungovernable juvenile,' " in
accordance with the original police call, Sanders said. "We've changed how we
code things, how we train our officers to view things that need to be reported."

Sanders noted that the department hadn't had a chance to review all the
statistics in the report.

Violent crime increased 11 percent in Provo, but the city still reported far
fewer numbers of such crimes than the other Utah cities of 100,000 or more.
Property crimes in Provo decreased 8.6 percent.

Other states in the FBI's western region are Alaska, Arizona, California,
Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington and
Wyoming.

Nationwide, levels fell with a 5.5 percent drop in the number of violent crimes
last year and a 2.8 percent drop in the number of property crimes, according to
the FBI. The last nationwide increase in violent crime was in 2005, the FBI
said.

The FBI reported that violent crime fell in all four regions of the country last
year -- 7.5 percent in the South, 5.9 in the Midwest, 5.8 percent in the West
and 0.4 percent in the Northeast.

The bureau's preliminary statistics for 2010 are based on information from more
than 13,000 law enforcement agencies.

Nationally, murder and non-negligent manslaughter declined 4.4 percent, forcible
rape decreased 4.2 percent, robbery declined 9.5 percent, and aggravated assault
was down 3.6 percent.

The downward trend for murder and non-negligent manslaughter was especially
pronounced in the nation's smallest cities, where it went down 25.2 percent for
cities with less than 10,000 people. Murder actually rose 3 percent in cities
with populations of 250,000 to half a million.

In regard to property crimes, motor vehicle theft showed the largest drop in
2010 -- 7.2 percent -- followed by larceny-theft, which was down 2.8 percent and
burglary, with a decline of 1.1 percent.

AU Center disputes survey on crime near city's colleges

BYLINE: Lyda Longa, Staff

SOURCE: CONSTITUTION

SECTION: Local News; Pg. 6E

LENGTH: 669 words

A report predicting the risk of becoming a victim of violent crime in
neighborhoods surrounding U.S. universities has angered Atlanta University
Center students and administrators.

The study lists the west Atlanta community that borders the AU Center as the
most dangerous of the neighborhoods around the nation's colleges and
universities.

The list of 25 schools is topped by Morris Brown College in the 600 block of
Martin Luther King Jr. Drive. LeMoyne-Owens College in Memphis earned the No. 2
spot. Spelman College, Clark Atlanta University and Morehouse College followed
to complete the top five in the survey. All five are predominantly black, as are
the neighborhoods they are in.

Georgia State University and Georgia Tech ranked 13th and 19th, respectively.

The AU Center schools are within Atlanta's Zone 1 police precinct, considered by
Atlanta police to be the second-most-dangerous among the city's six police
zones. Police officials did not comment on the report as they have not seen it,
said APD spokesman John Quigley.

The survey does not measure actual crime rates but rather predicts the risk of
crime for the coming year through a computer model that uses socioeconomic
factors such as household income, family structure, migration patterns, housing
values and average level of education. It did not take into account race or
ethnic origin.

Current crime statistics for Zone 1 were not available, but a homicide study
showed it had the second-highest number of homicides in the city in 1996 and
1997. In 1996, there were 63 murders in Zone 1; in 1997, 43. None was on the
college campuses. The area around the colleges makes up two of the zone's 13
beats.

"We really were very disturbed by the report," said Samuel Jolley Jr., executive
director and chief operating officer for Atlanta University Center Inc., the
consortium that manages the four main colleges at the AU Center. " There is a
misapplication of data that shows a correlation between the crime data of a
community and the crime inside the campuses."

The report is the first effort between APBnews.com and CAP Index Inc. The former
is a year-old, online news service specializing in crime, justice and safety
issues. The latter is a 12-year-old security company that prepares neighborhood
security reports and surveys for banks, fast-food chains and retailers.

Officials at both organizations said the report was created as a tool to help
parents and students take security precautions.

"I think parents want to know this information for their children," said Robert
Figlio, chief executive officer of CAP Index, based in Exton, Pa. "We believe
parents and their kids should know the makeup of the neighborhoods that surround
the schools they've chosen to attend."

Mark Sauter, chief operating officer at APBnews.com., based in New York City,
said the online service wanted to issue the report because colleges and
universities often underreport campus crime.

A handful of students, school officials and a nonprofit organization that
represents 19 private and public colleges in the city and the metro area echoed
Jolley, saying the survey tarnishes the schools' reputations.

"The report is inaccurate and misleading," said Elisher M. Ferrell, a
spokeswoman for Morehouse College. "It does not consider actual crime that takes
place within the college campuses, or crimes that involve students who live
within those campuses. Simply because a college is located in an area that is
economically disadvantaged does not mean that the students are at great risk of
personal crime."

Clark Atlanta student Ethel Johnson, editor of the school's newspaper The
Panther, agreed. She said the report doesn't take into account efforts by the
Atlanta Housing Authority, Spelman and Morehouse to revitalize some of the
neighborhoods near the AU Center.  "We feel this is just another one of those
studies that's meant to attack predominantly black colleges located in
underprivileged neighborhoods," she said.

ST. LOUIS RANKS HIGH IN CRIMES; NUMBERS SKEWED BY POPULATION LOSS, BOUNDARIES,
OFFICIALS SAY

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 11A

LENGTH: 621 words


Although St. Louis' crime numbers are dropping, the city remains near the top of
national crime rankings based on 1994 FBI figures released Sunday.

Among cities with a population of more than 250,000, p St. Louis ranked second
behind Newark, N.J., for crimes per 100,000 people. At the same time, the FBI
report shows that St. Louis had a 3 percent drop in violent crime and a 1
percent drop in property crimes from the previous year.

Outgoing city Police Chief Clarence Harmon says he's not surprised by the city's
high rank. "We're losing population at such a prodigious rate that our relative
standing doesn't change, even though we're having some dramatic declines in
crime," he said.

In murders, St. Louis saw a 7 percent drop last year from 1993 - but still
ranked third, behind New Orleans and Washington.  In the category of property
crimes, St. Louis was third behind Tampa, Fla., and Miami.

U.S. News & World Report ranked the cities, based on an analysis of the FBI's
new crime figures.

The city Police Department's figures for the first 10 months of 1995 show even
sharper drops compared to the same period in 1994 - about 20 percent fewer
murders and a 10 percent to 11 percent drop in crimes against people, a
department spokesman said.

City officials say St. Louis' national ranking is unfairly skewed because most
other cities have larger geographic areas within their boundaries. St. Louis has
not changed its boundaries since 1876, when it split from St. Louis County.

According to the FBI figures, overall crime in Missouri rose 5 percent in 1994,
and 0.6 percent in Illinois.

Nationally, the FBI said the total number of crimes against people and property
dropped 1 percent - led by an 8 percent drop in violent crime in cities with
more than a million residents.

But arrests of youths under age 18 for violent crimes surged by 7 percent. The
FBI report showed that the number of teens under 18 arrested for murder rose
158.3 percent from 1985 through 1994.

"That's the dark cloud behind the silver lining of the nice drop" in total
reported crime, Alfred Blumstein, a professor at Carnegie-Mellon University in
Pittsburgh, said. "There's less crime from older offenders but more crime among
younger offenders."

"This is the calm before the crime storm," said James Alan Fox, dean of
Northeastern University's college of criminal justice in Boston. "An impending
crime wave of teen violence is facing us as the adolescent population begins to
rise in America. There are 39 million children under age 10, more than we've had
for decades."

The FBI's annual count of seven major crimes reported to police found 13,991,675
offenses last year - a 1 percent drop from 1993. The total peaked at 14.8
million in 1991.

The violent crimes counted are murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault; the
property crimes are burglary, larceny and auto theft. The figures are drawn from
reports by 16,000 police agencies. Justice Department surveys consistently show
that less than half of all crime, even violent crime, is reported to the police.

The nation's rate of violent crime was 716 offenses for every 100,000 residents.
The violent crime rate, which adjusts for population growth, was down 4 percent
from 1993 but remained 29 percent higher than in 1985.

Other highlights of the FBI report include:

Murders in 1994 dropped 5 percent to 23,305, the lowest since 1989.

Aggravated assault, having increased steadily since 1983, dropped 1 percent.
Reported rapes dropped 4 percent from 1993, but this is considered the least
reliable figure in the report.

Property crimes dropped to 12.1 million offenses and to the lowest rate - 4,658
per 100,000 residents - since 1984.

Durham murders, assaults reflect national increase in violent crime

BYLINE: From staff and wire reports

SECTION: INSIDE FRONT; Pg. A3

LENGTH: 593  words


Murders and aggravated assaults increased in Durham last year, reflecting the
first national increase in violent crime since 1991, according to FBI data.

While the city saw a 2 percent drop in property crimes, a triumph Chief Steve
Chalmers attributed in March to the effects of gang suppression, aggravated
assaults climbed dramatically -- a 16 percent increase from 626 in 2004 to 726
in 2005.

The number of murders in the Bull City increased 9 percent from 32 homicides
reported by police in 2004 to 35 in 2005. That number does not include an
officer-involved shooting and a shooting death that was ruled a justifiable
homicide.

Robberies in the city fell from 814 in 2004 to 627 in 2005, despite a 4.5
percent national increase.

Nationwide, murders rose 4.8 percent, meaning there were more than 16,900
victims in 2005. That would be the most since 1998 and the largest percentage
increase in 15 years.

Murders soared from 59 to 104 in Birmingham, Ala., up 76 percent; from 59 to 85
in Charlotte-Mecklenburg County, a 44 percent increase; from 89 to 126 in Kansas
City, Mo., a 42 percent rise; from 87 to 122 in Milwaukee, a 40 percent jump;
and from 79 to 109 in Cleveland, a 38 percent increase.

Cities with 50,000 to 500,000 people recorded the largest increases in murder,
on average.

Despite the national numbers, Atlanta, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Los Angeles and
New York were among several large cities that saw the number of murders drop.

The overall increase in violent crime was modest, 2.5 percent, which equates to
more than 1.4 million crimes. Nevertheless, that was the largest percentage
increase since 1991.

The FBI data, compiled from reports by more than 12,000 law enforcement
agencies, does not contain overall crime numbers in any category nor does it
offer any explanation for the changes. The FBI's final annual crime report comes
out in the fall.

Criminal justice experts said the statistics reflect the nation's complacency in
fighting crime, a product of dramatic declines in the 1990s and the abandonment
of effective programs that emphasized prevention, putting more police officers
on the street and controlling the spread of guns.

"We see that budgets for policing are being slashed and the federal government
has gotten out of that business," said James Alan Fox, a criminal justice
professor at Northeastern University in Boston. "Funding for prevention at the
federal level and many localities are down and the [National Rifle Association]
has renewed strength."

But, Fox said, "We're still far better off than we were during the double-digit
crime inflation we saw in the 1970s."

Robberies were up 4.5 percent and aggravated assaults 1.9 percent, according to
preliminary data. Alone among violent crime categories, the number of rapes fell
1.9 percent.

Violent crimes peaked at 1.9 million in 1992 and fell steadily through the end
of that decade. The number has been relatively stable for the past six years.

Crime last year increased in all regions, although the 5.7 percent rise in the
Midwest was at least three times any other region's. These states make up the
Midwest: Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri,
Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota and Wisconsin.

Fox cautioned against reading too much into year-to-year changes in individual
cities, saying some differences result from random variation and marked swings
the previous year. Also, some large statistical increases result from some small
numerical changes.

In Hartford, Conn., for example, murders jumped more than 50 percent, from 16 to
25.

Serious crimes   up 2 per cent,   FBI report says

BYLINE: WS

DATELINE: Washington DC


Washington Star
  WASHINGTON - Serious crime in the United States increased slightly in
 1978, rising 2 per cent above the level of the preceding year, for a
 total increase of 9 per cent in the past five years, the Federal Bureau
 of Investigation reported yesterday.

The rate of serious crime nation-wide was 5,109 offences per 100,000
 inhabitants.

The FBI's Uniform Crime Reports - so called because they tabulate
 seven selected offences on a uniform basis - show the Washington
 metropolitan area as having the ninth-highest crime rate among the 15
 metropolitan areas with a population exceeding 2 million.

Leading the list was the San Franciso area with 8,046 offences per
 100,000 inhabitants, followed by Los Angeles, Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston,
 New York City, Baltimore, Detroit and Boston metropolitan areas in that
 order.

Metropolitan areas with serious crime rates lower than the rate here
 included St. Louis, Chicago, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Nassau and Suffolk
 counties in New York, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.

The report, covering only 1978, gives no hint of a rise in crime
 during the first half of this year. The FBI reported earlier this month
 that in the first half of 1979, serious crime rose 9 per cent over the
 comparable period of 1978.

Attorney-General Benjamin Civiletti called the most recent increase
'disturbing.' However, public opinion polls indicate that crime ranks  behind
inflation, unemployment and other

CRIME RATE DECLINE CONTINUES;
MANY THEORIES: EX-CHIEF MCNAMARA CITES THE
SMALLER NUMBER OF YOUNG MALES.

The dips in crime reported by many South Bay cities in 1994 are part of a
national trend that saw crime rates drop for the third year in a row, according
to figures just released by the FBI.

However, while property crimes and homicides generally fell, such cities as San
Jose, Sunnyvale and Fremont saw an increase in some violent offenses,
particularly aggravated assault.

Just why did violent crime nationwide fall 4 percent last year and property
crime 3 percent? Law enforcement officials are quick to take credit, and some
criminologists also point to new police programs. But others say it's all merely
the result of changing demographics.

Among those who credit the cops is Chuck Wexler, executive director of the
Police Executive Research Forum, a national organization that studies areas of
policing. He noted that in many cities, police officers have worked with
community members to reclaim parks, blocks and whole neighborhoods once overrun
with crime.

"Crime will never be the sole province of the police," Wexler said. "It
transcends any particular agency. Police working with local community groups to
get at the reasons behind crimes is why this decrease is occurring."

But Joseph D. McNamara, former San Jose police chief and now a research fellow
at the Hoover Institution, argued that programs such as these have never made a
real impact on the crime rate historically.

Instead, he attributed the drop in the crime rate to the decline in the
population of males age 14-24, the group that commits the most crimes. He warned
that the crime rate will rise again by 2000, as the number of males of that age
group grows an estimated 20 percent from today's totals.

"I guess the message is: Don't take the bars off your windows or do away with
your alarms, but don't get hysterical, either," McNamara said of the newly
released statistics. "The good news is that crime has declined . . . but the
challenge to the country is to find new ways to intervene as that (young male)
segment of the population grows again."

Fremont Police Chief Craig Steckler already knows the effects that type of
population can have on a community. In an exception to the national and South
Bay trend, overall crime in Fremont was up more than 18 percent from 1993.

Steckler couldn't explain precisely why the city had 57 more robberies and 201
more aggravated assaults in 1994 than in 1993, but he noted that his department
has been experiencing more problems with gangs lately.

To combat that, the city will begin placing police officers in high schools and
developing more after-school programs for youths, he said.

With Sunnyvale recording a significant dip in property crimes and a slight
increase in violent crimes -- six more rapes, four more robberies and four more
aggravated assaults from 1993 to 1994 -- city officials saw no cause for alarm.
Indeed, some officials believe the attention violent crimes have drawn in the
media lately has only led more people to report such crimes.

"There used to be a day when someone got punched in the nose and wouldn't report
it. Now, they do," said Sunnyvale Public Safety Capt. Steve Pigott. "I think
when citizens become more informed, they report more."

Although San Jose remains one of the safest large cities in the country, and
homicides fell from 41 in 1993 to 33 in 1994, the city did record a 19 percent
increase in aggravated assaults over that time period. Police spokesman Officer
Louis Quezada said that until he analyzed the numbers more closely, he wouldn't
be able to determine whether the increase was the result of gang violence.

On a more optimistic note, he pointed out the statistics show how extremely
capable area medical centers are in saving critically wounded people. When that
happens, the victims are classified as aggravated assaults rather than
homicides.

Violent crime breaking into mid-size cities

BYLINE: Tom Squitieri

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 8A

LENGTH: 380 words


Just as murder in big cities no longer has seasonal boundaries, ''big- city''
murder and violence now are knocking down geographic boundaries.

Preliminary 1991 FBI figures released Sunday show violent crimes had their
largest jump (8% over 1990) in mid-sized cities - population 100,000 to 499,000
- while violent crime edged up just 2% to 4% in the largest cities.

''Crime is beginning to peak in cities like New York and Los Angeles,'' said
James O'Kane, a Drew University sociologist.

One reason: Economic and other pressures are sending young males - the group
most likely to commit crimes - to other areas of the country.

''It's more than lights in playgrounds,'' O'Kane said to drops in crime. ''It's
much larger demographic and social forces.''

The 1991 murder rate was 9.9 per 100,000 people, second only to 1980's 10.2
rate.

The Midwest, traditionally an area producing lower crime rates, had an 8%
increase in violent crime and a 12% increase in murder. The West saw violent
crime rise 7%, with murders rising 10%.

Some reasons for those increases are the same as the ones that set big cities on
record murder paces for the past four years, criminologists said:

- Drugs and the easy availability of firearms.

- Economic problems that beset the nation are especially trenchant in smaller
towns.

- Gang-related problems have spread and become ingrained throughout the USA.

''We have a society, we have an economy, we have a way of thinking that produces
aggressive individuals,'' says Martin Schwartz of Ohio University.

''That 'me-first-ism' kind of thinking - when you combine it with the easy
availability of murderous weapons - makes it extremely easy to have high (crime
numbers) and very difficult to do something about it.''

The Justice Department statistics come at the start of the 13th annual National
Victims Rights Week - underscoring concerns that decreases in spending will
exacerbate the problem.

''We need renewed programs on crime prevention and improved rights and services
for crime victims,'' said John Stein, deputy director of the National
Organization for Victims Assistance.

Says Schwartz: ''The problem is so keyed into our society from one end to
another that those of us in criminology have no hope for a quick fix.''

Harsh crime analysis disputed;
Atlanta second from bottom in safety, Web site study claims.;
2008 FBI statistics are a mixed bag for city.

Atlanta is the nation's second least safe city, according to an independent
analysis of FBI crime statistics that's been disputed by some experts.

The ranking, compiled by the Web site Real Clear Politics, was derived by
dividing the total crimes detailed in the FBI's report by city population.
Atlanta's per-capita crime rate measured at 16 percent.

"Determining whether a city is safe or not is not as easy as that," said Chuck
Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, which has
representatives from law enforcement agencies nationwide.

"That's a very simplistic approach."

The annual FBI statistics, released last week, have been a mixed bag for
Atlanta. The positive: Violent crime decreased 8.3 percent in 2008 compared with
2007, with 672 fewer such incidents.

Property crimes, however, rose 7.6 percent in Atlanta; nationwide, a 1.6 percent
decrease was reported --- the first time property crime fell since 2003.
Burglaries and larcenies were both on the rise locally, the FBI said.

Whether perception or reality, crime has become a major concern for Atlantans,
and it has emerged as the leading issue in the upcoming mayoral election.

"That's certainly what a lot of Atlantans I've talked to have felt," said Kyle
Keyser, director and co-founder of Atlantans Together Against Crime. "They feel
like it's dangerous, regardless of what neighborhood you live in."

After Memphis, with an 18 percent crime rate, Atlanta, San Antonio, Detroit and
Milwaukee ranked as America's least safe cities, according to the Real Clear
Politics analysis.

The safest? New York City, with a per-capita crime rate hovering at 4.2 percent.
The rest of the list, in order: San Jose, Calif., Los Angeles, San Diego, El
Paso, Texas, Honolulu, Denver, Boston, Las Vegas and Louisville, Ky., which has
a 10 percent per-capita crime rate.

On its official Web site, the FBI cautions against using its stats to compare
which cities are safe or not.

The head of Atlanta's Police Foundation said he's more worried about future
results.

The city had 1,784 officers in 2008 --- "the most officers we ever had," said
David Wilkinson, president and CEO of the APF. "That is why the city had a good
year last year with crime statistics. Since that time, with budget cuts and
police furloughs, we're in a very dangerous situation right now."

Atlanta Mayor Shirley Franklin and Police Chief Richard Pennington could not be
reached for comment Sunday.

Thefts solved by DNA analysis;
Usageexpandsin non-violentcrime

BYLINE: Richard Willing

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 1A

LENGTH: 480 words


The national database of criminals' DNA, designed by the FBI to help solve rapes
and murders, increasingly is being used to identify suspects in unsolved
burglaries and other property crimes, a USA TODAY review of state crime lab
records shows.

In 10 states -- Alabama, Florida, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri, New Mexico, Ohio,
Oregon, Virginia and Wisconsin -- the total number of DNA matches in property-
crime cases has exceeded the number of matches in violent crimes, the review
indicates. Other states also are reporting increases in property-crime matches:
Of Georgia's first 171 matches, only 13 involved DNA from the scenes of unsolved
burglaries. Of the 300 matches that followed, 79 were in burglary cases.

Oregon state police DNA analyst Brian Ostrom says there are many reasons for the
rise in property-crime matches. DNA testing has become more sophisticated, he
says, allowing analysts to draw genetic profiles from evidence left at burglary
scenes -- palm prints, cigarette butts, sweat stains on gloves and masks --
nearly as easily as they can get profiles from blood or semen at the scenes of
violent crimes. And government grants for testing evidence, initially limited to
violent crimes, now can be used to analyze DNA from property crimes.

Since 1990, the states, the federal government and the military have collected
DNA from those convicted of felonies -- serious crimes punishable by more than a
year in prison -- and stored the genetic profiles in computer databases. Several
states collect DNA from those convicted of misdemeanors, such as minor assaults.
With FBI software, the profiles are compared with DNA from crimes. The system
was designed to "solve violent crimes," its mission statement says.

The database contains DNA profiles from about 3.5 million people and has scored
matches in about 38,000 cases, FBI scientist Thomas Callaghan says. The  system
adds about 25,000 profiles a month.

The FBI does not keep track of the types of crimes for which the system scores
DNA matches, nor does it track how many matches produce arrests or convictions.
USA TODAY compiled statistics on matches by reviewing records in the 20 states
that account for about 85% of the system's matches.

Critics say using DNA to solve non-violent crimes could raise privacy concerns
by dramatically expanding the database. Some question spending millions of
dollars to probe such crimes. "For what it does in terms of cost, and in threats
to civil liberties, (the database) has to justify itself much better,"
University of Minnesota political science professor Jay Aronson says.

Backers of expanded DNA testing say burglars often go on to commit more serious
crimes. In Alabama, about 80% of the rapes solved via DNA databasing in the past
five years were linked to criminals whose DNA was taken after a burglary
conviction, state forensic biology chief Angelo Della Manna says.

Crime rate continues descent

BYLINE: Richard Willing

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 647 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON


WASHINGTON -- The USA's violent-crime rate continued to drop last
year, falling to its lowest level since the government began measuring
it in 1973, the Bureau of Justice Statistics reported Sunday.

The bureau's National Crime Victimization Survey estimated that
violent crime struck 33.7 of every 1,000 Americans 12 or older
last year. That was a 10% decrease from 1998 and a 50% decrease
from 1993, when violent crime began to plummet.


Survey takers asked 77,750 people whether they had been victims
of crime in 1999. For purposes of the survey, violent crime included
rape, sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault and simple assault.

"This is especially good news because it shows that the crimes
going down are not just murder, which is rare, but the everyday
crimes that get in people's faces and erode the quality of life,"
says Jack Levin, a criminologist at Northeastern University in
Boston.

Among the survey's other findings:

* Fewer burglaries caused the property crime rate to drop
almost 10% from 1998 to 1999, from 217 crimes per 1,000 households
to 198.

* A nearly 11% decline in simple assault, the most common
violent crime the survey measures, accounted for most of the overall
decline from 1998 to 1999.

* Robbery and aggravated assault declined slightly, while
rapes increased from 110 per 1,000 people to 141.

* Last year, violent crime rates fell most dramatically
for men, white people, city dwellers and people earning more than
$ 75,000 annually.

* The rate at which black people were victims of violent
crime -- about 42 per 1,000 people -- remained static from 1998
to 1999, while the white victimization rate fell from 36.3 per
1,000 people to 31.9.

* People living in the West were most likely to be victims
of violent crime, at a rate of nearly 37 per 1,000 people. Northeasterners,
with 29.6 violent crimes per 1,000 people, were least likely.

Murder was not included in the survey. Preliminary FBI data suggest
that murders declined from 16,914 in 1998 to 15,561 murders last
year. However, the number jumped in several cities, including
Honolulu, Sacramento, San Diego, Albuquerque, Denver, Phoenix
and Jacksonville, Fla.

Students of crime trends ascribed the continuing decline to a
combination of factors: new policing methods, tougher sentencing
and parole guidelines, a vigorous economy, better security in
public places and improved crime-fighting technology, including
computer targeting of high crime areas.

"It's hard to single out one thing, but (overall) it seems we're
doing a lot of things right," says Gerald Robin, a criminology
professor at the University of New Haven in Connecticut.

"The decline in simple assault is especially encouraging," he
said. "It may show that crimes like domestic violence are now
getting the attention that used to be reserved for more high-profile
crimes."

Susan Herman, a victims advocate, called the survey's findings
"good news" but urged greater government effort to help victims
recover.

"We've created a national commitment to bring crime down," says
Herman, executive director of the National Center for Victims
of Crime in Arlington, Va. "We haven't been nearly as creative
in thinking about helping victims rebuild their lives."

Violent and non-violent crime costs about $ 450 billion annually,
she says. Victims receive $ 265 million in compensation from state
and federal governments.


Acts against people, property decrease

from 1993 through 1999. Declines in the rates of selected crimes:

Picked pockets or purses-60.9%
Attempted theft-56.9%

A Decline in Crime for 15th Year Is Found in a Survey of Households

BYLINE: AP

SECTION: Section A; Page 12; Column 1; National Desk

LENGTH: 459 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 8


The rate of crime reported in a survey of American households dropped last year
to 23.7 percent, continuing a decline that began after 1975, according to a
Justice Department report.

The report, made public Wednesday by the department's Bureau of Justice
Statistics said the crime rate improved in virtually all categories but still
reflected wide disparities by region, wealth and race.

The statistics are from the National Crime Victimization Survey of people at
least 12 years old who live in about 50,000 households nationwide. The survey
includes information on crimes not reported to the police, although murder is
not included because the data is solely from crime victims.

The rate of crime reported in the survey is higher than that reported by the
Federal Bureau of Investigation. Criminologists consider the survey a more
accurate reflection of the level of crime than the bureau's Uniform Crime
Reports, which are based on crimes reported to the authorities.

The report said most of the reduction in crime was the result of a decline in
thefts. The percentage of members in households reporting a personal theft
dropped to 10.5 from 11.2, while the percentage of households in which there was
a theft directly from the home declined to 7.5 from 8, the report said.

The West was the most crime-prone region, with 27.9 percent of households
affected, while the Northeast had the best rate, 19.8 percent, the report said.
The rates were 24.3 percent for the South and 23 percent for the Midwest.

Homicide Rate Is UP

The 23,440 homicides reported last year were the most for any year, but the
number would not influence the overall crime percentages, given the 34.8 million
crimes reported in the survey. .

In 1975, the first year of the survey, 32.1 percent of the nation's households
reported experiencing a crime, and the rate has been declining each year since
then.

There was notable improvement in the overall rates for households headed both by
whites and by blacks, but a substantial difference remained.

The two races experienced about the same rate of crime in 1975, with 33 percent
of black households and 32 percent of white households victimized by at least
one crime of violence or theft. By contrast, the level last year was 27.8
percent for black homes and 23.1 percent for white homes. The figures were 29.1
percent for black homes in 1989 and 24.3 percent for white homes.

Last year, 31.3 percent of Hispanic households suffered a crime, as against 23.1
percent of non-Hispanic homes, it said.

The overall number of households that experienced a crime last year was 22.652
million, or 23.7 percent of all households, the report said. In 1989, the
figures were 23.221 million, or 24.6 percent.

IT'S OFFICIAL: LONDON OVERTAKES NEW YORK IN NON-VIOLENT CRIME

BYLINE: Ed Vulliamy

SECTION: THE GUARDIAN HOME PAGE; Pg. 2

LENGTH: 477 words


LONDON has a 57 per cent higher burglary rate than New York and there are now
fewer burglaries per head in Los Angeles than in Sydney, Australia.

The latest astonishing crime statistics in the United States show overall crime
levels in America tumbling, especially non-violent crime in the two largest
conurbations, New York and Los Angeles.

The Warren Legal Institute - part of the University of California at Berkeley -
today publishes an analysis of official crime figures which shows "property
crime" in the US falling to all-time lows since 1980.

The drop in property crime, which includes burglary, larceny and car theft, has
been so steep that the overall crime rate in the US ranks alongside the
Netherlands, New Zealand, Australia and Canada.

Those countries now have just as many criminals per head as America, says the
institute's director, Franklin Zimring.

He says property crime has increased in virtually all industrial societies,
apart from the US.  Property crime in Germany is up by 177 per cent since 1980
and up by 600 per cent in Italy.

The fall in US property crime, Prof Zimring says, has been overshadowed by the
continued high levels in violent crime. There are seven property crimes for
every one violent crime. But the latter (although also falling recently) remains
a scourge in American society and has led to demands for tougher policing and
sentencing.

Violent crime in the US has increased since 1980 by 6 per cent, although it has
fallen since 1990.

Property crime, meanwhile, has fallen by 17 per cent since 1980 and more
dramaticaly since 1990. Burglaries are down by 44 per cent, with a remarkable
drop from 1,250 per 100,000 people in 1990, to 900 in 1995 - the first time the
figure has gone below 1,000 since modern record-keeping began.

The most dramatic drop was in San Diego, California, traditionally presented as
teeming with illegal Mexican immigrants for whom thieving is a way of life. In
fact, despite years of mass immigration, burglary fell by 69 per cent, car theft
by 61 per cent and larceny by 37 per cent, according to police figures.

San Diego police attribute the fall to "the end of the professional burglar".
Criminologist Scott Decker, author of a book about armed robbery to be published
this month, told the New York Times: "One of the most remarkable things about
the decline in burglary is that it is so substantial that it is unprecedented in
magnitude compared to any other fluctuation in crime rates over the past
century."

Prof Zimring said he thought the drop in property crime underscored a
fundamental point about America's crime problem: "What we have is not a crime
problem, but a problem of lethal violence. That is a special issue."

Citing France and Britain, he said: "Many nations have high levels of crime
without high homicide rates."

Report: Two Illinois cities among the nation's Top 10 most dangerous

BYLINE: Kevin Hoffman, Reboot Illinois

SECTION: NATIONAL POLITICAL NEWS

LENGTH: 699 words


Oct. 01--Two Illinois cities ranked among the nation's Top 10 most dangerous
cities with populations under 200,000, according to a new analysis of the latest
FBI crime data.

Law Street Media's "Crime in America 2016? rankings, which uses the FBI's 2014
violent crimes statistics, show crime rates nationwide dropped by roughly 1
percent over the year.

From Law Street on its methodology:

Law Street used the FBI's four major violent crime categories -- murders,
aggravated assaults, robberies, and rapes -- to create a standard measure of
violent-crimes-per-100,000 people among all cities reporting crime data to the
FBI. This allows year-to-year and city-to-city comparisons. To derive the ratio,
the total number of violent crimes reported to the FBI is divided by the city's
population, with the result then multiplied by 100,000. The formula for this
calculation is shown below:

Violent Crime Rate = (Total Violent Crime in a City/City Population) x 100,000.
Crime ratings were further broken down by population, with 200,000 used as the
dividing point.

Illinois is one of three states to have multiple cities appear on the list. The
violent crime rate in the state capital increased 5 percent over the year,
propelling Springfield from the No. 11 spot the previous year to No. 7 in this
year's rankings. There number of rapes increased by 26 to 97, which Law Street
says could be a result of the FBI's revised and broader definition of rape.

Despite a 10 percent decrease in its violent crime rate, Rockford remains the
second most dangerous city with a population below 200,000. Incidences of rapes,
robberies and aggravated assaults all declined, including the number of murders,
which dropped from 19 to 17 over the year.

Colo. cities score in safety Ft. Collins 14th in magazine poll

BYLINE: Denver Post Staff and Wire Reports

LENGTH: 794 words

Money Magazine lists two Colorado cities in the top 10 percent of its safest
cities in the United States.

The state also scored one more in the top fourth, still another in the top
third, another in the top half, and the last Colorado city listed was among the
best of the rest.

Fort Collins leads the Colorado parade with its listing as the 14th safest of
202 cities in America ranked by the magazine. Lakewood is Money's 17th safest.
Others are Colorado Springs, 41st; Aurora, 56th; Pueblo, 85th; and Denver,
109th. Amherst, N.Y., is No. 1 Amherst, N.Y., is ranked as the safest city in
the United States. Newark, N.J., is the most dangerous, for Money's money.

But the news was not welcomed by everyone.

"How can we be rated fifth safest by one analysis of FBI statistics and 56th by
Money Magazine?" asked Aurora Mayor Paul Tauer.

Crime has been down for the last five years, and the city has implemented
innovative anti-crime programs that other jurisdictions are copying, he pointed
out.

Fort Collins Acting Police Chief Bud Reed had a positive reaction.

He said he hopes the city's record can be maintained as Fort Collins continues
to grow. The community's population has swelled dramatically during the past
decade to about 103,000, and crime there has followed that upward trend.

Money searched out the crime issues of greatest concern to Americans to
determine its rankings. Break-ins are most feared A nationwide telephone poll of
501 people, conducted in October for the magazine by Roper Starch, found the
issue that respondents feared most was that someone will break into their home.

Two-thirds of those surveyed said burglary was a serious or somewhat serious
threat to themselves and their families. Other responses included car theft, 61
percent; robbery, 60.5 percent; aggravated assault, 50 percent; rape, 48.5
percent; and murder, 40 percent.

The magazine then asked Morgan Quitno, a research firm based in Lawrence, Kan.,
that specializes in crime statistics, to identify the safest and most dangerous
cities in the United States by adjusting the FBI's 1995 crime statistics to give
greater emphasis to the crimes that the respondents considered most threatening.

The 10 safest cities, in descending order, were: Amherst; Thousand Oaks, Calif.;
Irvine, Calif.; Simi Valley, Calif.; Sunnyvale, Calif.; Virginia Beach, Va.;
Livonia, Mich.; Plano, Texas; Madison, Wis.; and Mesquite, Texas, according to
the survey which appears in the magazine's 1997 Forecast issue, available on
newsstands Dec. 2.

The 10 most dangerous cities were: Newark; Atlanta; St. Louis; New Orleans;
Detroit; Baltimore; Miami; Washington; Flint, Mich.; and Birmingham, Ala.

Amherst, a suburb of Buffalo with 107,000 residents, had the nation's lowest
rates for overall violent crime and burglary. Amherst Police Chief John Askey
attributed the city's safety more to its suburban setting and affluent,
well-educated population than to any special crime-fighting prowess by his
force.

"Most cities with populations of more than 100,000 are urban settings where
there is street crime, crowded living conditions and high levels of poverty,"
Askey told the magazine. "Amherst is more like a big quiet suburb than a city,
so we don't have those problems."

Authorities in the Colorado cities credited their showing in the crime
-comparisons to community policing policies and crime-fighting partnerships with
residents.

Lakewood involves the community with helping itself in stopping crime, said
Police Chief Charlie Johnston. Officers on the street work with residents to
identify the underlying problems.

"We attack problems rather than attacking symptoms," he said.

Lt. Alan Scott of the Colorado Springs police said his community is "a
comfortable place in which to live. Our economy is good, and our population is
spread out over 180 square miles. All that helps. Also, there is a lot of
community connection with the department, so we do a lot of things in
partnership." SAFE CITIES The 10 safest cities, in descending order, and

Poll: Get tougher on crime / 80% willing to pay for more police

BYLINE: Sam Vincent Meddis; Robert Davis

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 1A

LENGTH: 272 words


A frightened and fed-up USA wants to get even tougher on crime - and is willing
to pay at least part of the bill.

With crime a major issue in Tuesday's state and local elections, a USA
TODAY/CNN/ Gallup Poll shows:

80% favor putting more police on the streets - and paying higher taxes to do it.

82% want to make it harder to parole violent inmates.

79% want tougher sentences for all crimes.

75% want to make it harder for those charged with violent crimes to post bail.

"There is not only crime but a fear of crime," says Chuck Wexler of the Police
Executive Research Forum, a think tank.

The poll of 1,244 adults, taken earlier this month, shows nearly 90% believe the
USA's crime problem is growing.

But recent FBI statistics show a 4% drop in overall reported crime in 1992.

The difference between perception and reality, experts say, is due in part to
the growing number of headline-grabbing crimes across the country.

"It's understandable that the fear is worse," says ex-New York City police
commissioner Patrick Murphy.

The poll also shows:

86% say courts don't deal harshly enough with criminals.

43% say there's more crime in their neighborhoods than a year ago; 17% say less.

64% want stiffer gun laws.

The three most critical factors thought to be causing crime are drugs, lack of
moral training at home and guns.

TV's influence, an issue in the news, was also cited.

On other crime fronts, the Brady Bill's chance of passage increased this week
when it was broken out from the crime package now in Congress.

The bill requires a 5-day waiting period and background check on handgun buyers.

The Tips Line Joins Gun and Nightstick in Fighting Crime

BYLINE: By GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE

SECTION: Section 1;   Page 61;   Column 1;   Metropolitan Desk

LENGTH: 768 words


On Sept. 4, a day after thieves fled with $1.25 million in jewelry from
Tiffany's, detectives from the New York Police Department's Crime Stoppers Unit
fielded a call.

"Teddy did it," the anonymous caller said.

"Teddy who?" the detective asked.

"Theodore Johnson, who works at a midtown store," the caller replied. "He is
selling jewelry in the streets."

Three days later, Mr. Johnson was arrested with several rings still in his
pocket, and the police ultimately arrested five others in the crime.

Detectives say they were able to solve the Tiffany robbery, and several other
widely publicized crimes -- like the rape of a woman on the Coney Island
boardwalk -- with the help of a simple telephone call by an anonymous tipster.

The callers took advantage of the Crime Stoppers line, in which the department
pays informants for tips that later result in indictments. In less than 20
years, Crime Stoppers -- which also operates in 600 other communities throughout
the country -- has become one of the fastest growing and most visible anticrime
programs in the country.

Crime Stoppers was started in Albuquerque in 1976 by a detective and has since
spread from large cities like Boston to tiny hamlets like Grenada, Miss. The
programs, which operate independently from each other, are also found in
countries like Canada, the United Kingdom and Israel.

"I think it's probably the most successful police initiative in the country,"
said Gregg Roberts, program director of the New York City Police Foundation, a
civilian nonprofit organization that administers the program. "It's the best way
for private citizens to help the police department remove dangerous criminals
from our streets."

The program has become the video-age equivalent of the wanted poster, a product
of an era when lawmen in a dusty frontier town would offer a bounty for the
capture of an outlaw. The modern-day version, however, relies primarily on
television, but also uses radio and newspapers to publicize unsolved crimes. It
has been instrumental in 78,470 convictions and the recovery of about $2.8
billion, while paying more than $32.4 million in rewards, according to Crime
Stoppers International, a clearinghouse of programs throughout the world.

While the New York program started in 1983, since William J. Bratton became
Police Commissioner, in January, there has been renewed emphasis on publicizing
Crime Stoppers as an effective tool to help fight crime.

Visitors to police headquarters at One Police Plaza, in lower Manhattan, are
greeted by a giant Crime Stoppers poster with a picture of a hidden face holding
a phone. In addition, every news bulletin released by the police includes the
Crime Stoppers number, (800) 577-TIPS. And Crime Stoppers posters featuring such
make-believe crime fighting phantoms as the Lone Ranger and Zorro have become
part of the decor inside the cubicles of central booking offices throughout the
city.

"It's based on trust and cooperation," said Lieut. Richard S. Kuberski,
commanding officer of the Crime Stoppers Unit. "The detective develops a
relationship with the caller and they work together to solve the crime."

Over the 11 years of its existence in New York, the police have credited Crime
Stoppers with solving 493 murders, 808 robberies and 39 rapes. Those tips have
resulted in awards of $354,000 to callers, financed by the New York City Police
Foundation.

Some criminologists say that while the program is indeed effective at solving
certain crimes, it has little impact on crime over all, despite vast publicity
about the program.

"It's making a very small dent in a large problem," said Dr. Dennis Rosenbaum, a
professor of criminal justice at the University of Illinois at Chicago. "It
gives the impression that this is the most effective way to fight crime or this
is all we need to do to fight crime."

But Sgt. Susan Cassidy, of the department's Crime Stoppers Unit, said the
program can be an effective way to solve tough crimes.

"It's just another tool available to the detectives out in the field," Sergeant
Cassidy said. "It does not by any means replace our traditional investigative
methods. Before Crime Stoppers, it took detectives hours pounding the pavement,
knocking on doors to get a bit of information."

In the Crime Stoppers office, a large room on the 13th floor at One Police
Plaza, about a dozen detectives work phones that seem to ring incessantly.
Handling as many as 100 calls a day, the detectives cajole callers into giving
more information that may provide them with tips to solve a fresh case or a
long-unsolved one.

City fifth in violence crime

BYLINE: Shaun Sutner, TELEGRAM & GAZETTE STAFF

SECTION: LOCAL NEWS; Pg. A3

LENGTH: 532 words

DATELINE: WORCESTER


While the city's property crime rate has gradually declined by more than 30
percent over a 15-year period, its violent crime rate has not changed, according
to a new report by The Research Bureau.

Meanwhile, Worcester's violent crime rate ranks it fifth among the 10 largest
New England cities - with a rate of violent crime that is higher than Providence
and Boston, but lower than New Haven, Conn., Springfield, Hartford and
Bridgeport, Conn.

In 2010, there were 35.6 percent fewer property crimes in Worcester, such as
burglary, larceny, theft, shoplifting and vandalism, than there were in 1995,
but only 2.1 percent fewer violent crimes such as murders, assaults and
robberies, according to the bureau's report, "Benchmarking Public Safety in
Worcester: 2012."

The report, which consists mainly of charts and short explanations of the
statistics, is the eighth such public safety benchmarking report that has been
issued by the bureau, an independent nonprofit funded by corporations,
foundations, universities and individuals that tracks the city's finances and
administration.

Police Chief Gary J. Gemme said he is reviewing the report.

While Worcester had more violent crime overall than Providence, the Rhode Island
city with which it is often compared, Providence generally has had more murders
than Worcester. In 2010, Providence had 15 murders compared to Worcester's
seven; in 2009, Providence had 24 murders, while Worcester had seven.

The report also found that in 2010, Worcester ranked sixth of the 10 biggest New
England cities in terms of police staffing levels.

Waterbury, Conn., Providence, Bridgeport, New Haven, Conn., Hartford and Boston
all had more uniformed employees on average per 1,000 residents, according to
data compiled by the bureau from the FBI's 2010 crime survey.

With a staffing rate of 2.3 uniformed employees per 1,000 residents, Worcester
has more uniformed officers than Springfield, Manchester, N.H., and Stamford,
Conn. The 2.3 rate is above the average rate of 1.8 for cities with 100,000 to
250,000 residents, according to the FBI.

The report also evaluated the effects of the economic recession on crime rates
and staffing levels in the Worcester Police and Fire departments.

The recession had no significant effect on crime trends in the city, with
similar rates for murder, shootings, aggravated assault, robbery, burglary,
shoplifting, larceny, prostitution and drug offenses from 2007 to 2011.

However, the number of uniformed positions in the Worcester Police Department is
down 11 percent since the late 1990s, with 64 fewer positions since 1998, a
decline of 11 percent.

Fire Department staffing levels are also down, but only 2 percent, or eight
positions, the report said.

Firefighter workloads have increased, but mainly in emergency medical services.
The number of structure fires decreased from 716 in 2002 to 627 in 2011, while
first responder and rescue calls shot up from 14,624 to 19,857 over the same
period.

Emergency medical service workload for UMass Memorial EMS rose more than 30
percent from 2002 to 2011, while the average response time declined by 55
seconds, according to the report.

Drugs fuel 3% rise in crime rate

BYLINE: Sam Meddis

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 1A

LENGTH: 292 words


The USA's crime rate rose again in 1989 for the fifth straight year and law
enforcement officials blame the 3 percent jump on illicit drugs.

Preliminary figures from the FBI's 1989 crime report, released Sunday, show:

- Violent crime up 5 percent - with robbery showing the biggest increase, 7
percent.

- Property crime up 2 percent; motor vehicle thefts had the biggest increase, 9
percent.

''The crime engine is being driven by drugs,'' says Hubert Williams of the
Police Foundation, a leading law enforcement research organization.

A USA TODAY computer analysis of the crime statistics for cities with
populations of 100,000 or more found:

- Atlanta had the highest overall crime rate - 20,690 crimes per 100,000
population.

- Elizabeth, N.J., between 1988 and 1989, had the highest increase in overall
crime at nearly 22 percent.

- Washington, with 434 homicides, had the highest murder rate - 71.85 per
100,000.

Sen. Joseph Biden Jr., D-Del., chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, says
the drug war needs to be focused more on addicts than casual users: ''The
persons who commit the most violent crimes are the persons who are addicted ...
and they are increasing.''

Biden calls for more treatment facilities to get addicts off drugs and more
prevention programs to cut the growth in addicts.

Building more prisons alone won't solve the problem, experts say. More than
700,000 inmates are held in state and federal prisons - more than double the
number in 1980.

University of Chicago criminologist Norval Morris, co-author of Between Prison
and Probation, recommends alternative punishments for drug offenders - for
example, rigidly enforced drug treatment in the community with random drug
testing in some cases.

SERIOUS CRIME DOWN 3% IN '82

BYLINE: UPI

SECTION: Section D; Page 13, Column 1; National Desk

LENGTH: 409 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 11


The number of serious crimes reported in the United States dropped 3 percent in
1982 and the crime rate dropped 4 percent, the sharpest declines in six years,
the Federal Bureau of Investigation said today.

The bureau's annual uniform crime report, which compiles information from 15,000
law-enforcement agencies, said 12.9 million serious crimes were reported to the
authorities in 1982, down from 13.3 million in 1981.

The crime rate, a comparison between the number of serious crimes reported and
the total population, was 5,553 for every 100,000 people.

The bureau had reported the trend this spring in issuing preliminary figures.
Attorney General William French Smith said he was pleased that the crime
statisics showed a decline, but he noted they were 47 percent higher than a
decade ago.

''We are glad we won a battle,'' he said, ''but we are still in a war.''

Another report, issued last Sunday, said the number of Americans victimized by
crime fell 4.1 percent in 1982, the largest drop since the National Crime Survey
started 10 years ago. That survey showed there were 39.8 million incidents of
crime against people, down from 41.5 million in 1981.

James Fyfe, a criminal justice professor at American University, said the drop
in the number of crimes was likely due to the aging of the baby boom generation;
people are committing fewer crimes as they grow older.

''You have to rememeber you are talking about reported crime,'' Mr. Fyfe noted.
''An awful lot of crime is not reported, particularly in the areas most affected
by crime - like the ghetto where people have given up.''

The number of serious crimes in New York State dropped 5.9 percent in 1982, but
the crime rate, which fell 6.3 percent, was still substantially higher than the
national average. The number of serious crimes in New Jersey declined by almost
8 percent, and in Connecticut by 6 percent.

According to the report, murder declined nationwide by 7 percent, robbery was
down 6 percent and forcible rape dropped 5 percent. Aggravated assault, the only
index crime to increase in volume, was up 1 percent.

In property crimes, burglary decreased 9 percent, motor vehicle theft dropped 2
percent and larceny-theft declined 1 percent.

The crime index showed declines of 6 percent in the Northeastern states; 5
percent in the North Central states, and 3 percent in the West. Southern states
registered virtually no change in totals for the last two years.

CRIME FALLS BUT FEAR RISES

BYLINE: Jonathan Freedland In Washington

SECTION: THE GUARDIAN FOREIGN PAGE; Pg. 10

LENGTH: 345 words


NEW YORK, Washington and Los Angeles breathed a sigh of relief yesterday as an
FBI league table revealed that none of them is America's most crime-ridden city.

The winner is Newark, New Jersey. And close behind it are St Louis and Atlanta,
venue of the 1996 Olympic Games.

New York's exclusion from the crime top 25 was one of several surprises in the
FBI statistics, which included evidence that although random killings are up,
overall US crime is down.

Newark, New Jersey - an industrial city - had 19.3 cases of homicide, rape,
aggravated assault and robbery per thousand residents, the highest in the
country.

British tourists will note that Florida has two places in the crime top 10,
Miami and Tampa, at numbers four and five respectively.

Embarrassingly for President Clinton, his home town, Little Rock, Arkansas, is
number 6.

New York officials celebrated the city's FBI ranking as America's 27th most
criminal city. The mayor, Rudolph Giuliani, said tourists should come to the Big
Apple without fear.

Los Angeles - notorious for drive-by shootings and drug gangs - showed a 15 per
cent drop in violent crime, making it number 20.

Meanwhile, in the separate homicide league table, New Orleans retained its
unwanted position as the US murder capital. The city reported 48 murders for
every 100,000 people in 1993.

Richmond, Virginia, was the surprise runner-up, and Washington, DC - where
shootings are a daily occurrence - slipped to third place.

Nationally, violent crime was down 4 per cent on the previous year. Yet fear of
crime is rising, and a growing number of Americans are arming themselves for the
first time.

Of the 24,526 murders in the US in 1993, 53 per cent were committed by
assailants unknown to their victims. Until now, most homicides were the work of
relatives or friends.

The result is that, even if crime rates are falling, most people fear violence
more.

The now random nature of the crime gave every American a realistic chance of
becoming a murder victim, the FBI study said.

LAWRENCE, Kan. (AP) Ä Louisiana is the country's ""Most Dangerous State,'' while
North Dakota is the fourth safest, according to a survey by a Kansas publishing
company. Vermont was found to be the safest of the 50 states, according to ""
Crime State Rankings 1994,'' a book published over the weekend by Morgan Quitno
Corp.

of Lawrence and based on key crime statistics. Scott Morgan, president of the
publishing company, said the rankings are based on 16 factors, including overall
state crime rates, juvenile crime statistics, crime clearances, police
protection and expenditures and the change in crime rates over the past five
years. In all, Louisiana ranked No. 1 in two of the 16 categories Ä its murder
rate of 17.4 per 100,000 residents, and its prisoner incarceration rate. The
state had 478 people in state prison per 100,000 residents, compared to the
national average of 303 per 100,000. Maryland was ranked the second most
dangerous state, followed by Texas, Illinois and Florida. Rounding out the top
10 were California, Nevada, New York, Arizona and South Carolina. Maine followed
Vermont as the state considered safest. Next came Iowa, North Dakota, West
Virginia, New Hampshire, Nebraska, South Dakota, Kentucky, Montana and Wyoming.
The book ranks the states in more than 450 categories, and Morgan said the 16
factors considered the most critical were used in determining which states are
most dangerous. Morgan said his company goes beyond the FBI's annual crime
reports in compiling its statistics. On the overall crime rate, Louisiana ranked
fifth with 6,546.5 crimes per 100,000 residents in 1992. Florida was first, with
8,358.2, followed by Texas, Arizona and California. In violent crime, Florida
was again leader, followed by New York, California, Maryland and Louisiana.
California, the nation's most populous state, led the nation in murders and
non-negligent manslaughters in 1992 with 3,921, or 16.5 percent of the national
total.

POLICE SAY ARRESTS ON COAST HALT BID BY ORGANIZED CRIME

BYLINE: AP

SECTION: Section A; Page 13, Column 3; National Desk

LENGTH: 443 words

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Oct. 28


An attempt by organized crime to take over $1 million-a-week bookmaking
operations here was cut short today with the arrests of 20 people, including the
reputed leader of organized crime in Southern California, the police said.

Among those arrested was Peter John Milano, ''considered to be the head of
organized crime'' in Southern California, police Chief Daryl Gates said.

The investigation, called ''Operation Lightweight,'' began in the spring, was
suspended during the Summer Olympics and resumed immediately afterward, Chief
Gates said at a news conference.

''We feel the name is appropriate because organized crime is such a lightweight
in Southern California,'' said Chief Gates, who referred to Southern California
crime families as ''the Mickey Mouse Mafia.''

The arrest warrants charged the 20 suspects with conspiracy to commit
bookmaking.



Bookmakers Were 'Squeezed'

''The investigation identified eight bookmakers who were being squeezed for
either money or a percentage of their operation,'' he said.

He said seven bookmaking locations were seized and that it was estimated that
approximately $1 million in wagers were being handled at those locations each
week.

Some of the bookmakers approached ''were scared,'' he said. ''The important
thing here is that bookmakers in Southern California are not organized. We have
managed to keep organized crime from doing that.''

Mr. Milano appeared to be overseeing the operation and those involved reported
to him, Detective John Motto said. ''If organized crime exists here in Los
Angeles, this fellow would be the boss,'' he said.



Son Said to Control Crime Empire

PROVIDENCE, R.I., Oct. 28 (AP) - Raymond J. Patriarca has taken control of his
late father's organized crime empire in New England, according to an affidavit
from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, filed in Federal District Court in
Boston.

Federal investigators and Attorney General Dennis J. Roberts 2d of Rhode Island
have said they could not comment on the six-page affidavit, which asserts that
New England crime families chose Mr. Patriarca, 39 years old, to replace his
father, Raymond L. S. Patriarca, who died July 11 at 76.

Mr. Roberts said the younger Mr. Patriarca controlled a crime network involving
gambling, loan sharking, prostitution and pornography in the six New England
states except for southern Connecticut.

The affidavit was filed by the Justice Department's Organized Crime Strike Force
as part of the Federal Government's attempt to prevent the release of a reputed
Boston crime figure, Gennaro J. Angiulo, who is jailed awaiting trial on
racketeering charges.

U.S. WILL PAY FOR 738 OFFICERS IN HIGH-CRIME AREAS

BYLINE: From News Services

SECTION: NEWS, Pg. 2

LENGTH: 401 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON


* The $ 106 million program is an experimental effort to be paid for with money
granted under the 1994 crime law.

President Bill Clinton stepped up federal crime-fighting efforts Friday with an
announcement that the government will pick up the entire cost of hiring more
than 700 police officers to patrol high-crime neighborhoods.

The plan expands an existing federal aid program for local law enforcement that
Clinton said has put more than 75,000 police officers on the streets and cut
crime.

"There are still some neighborhoods in America, and too many of them, where
crime hasn't receded far enough or fast enough," Clinton said in an appearance
in the White House Rose Garden of a group of police officers.

"We need to do more. We have to focus our resources on high-crime, high-need
neighborhoods to bring the benefits of community policing to every community,"
the president said.

"And in the difficult areas, that means we have to reach a critical mass of
police officers and community policing before it can make the necessary
difference," he said.

The $ 106 million program announced by Clinton is an experimental effort to be
paid for with money granted under the 1994 crime law. The law aims to help local
communities hire 100,000 more police officers over six years by providing
federal money for 75 percent of the cost.

The new program will waive the matching requirement for hiring 738 officers in
18 high-crime neighborhoods, thus leaving the federal government to pick up the
entire tab.

Money will be used, for example, in Chicago to fight drug-related crimes, in
Baltimore to fight drugs and violent crimes, in Miami to patrol neighborhoods
along the Miami River, and in Hartford to fight resurgent gang activity, Clinton
said.

Other eligible cities are Camden, N.J.; Bessemer and Birmingham, Ala.; Flint and
Muskegon, Mich.; Fresno and San Bernardino, Calif.; Fort Pierce, Fla.; Monroe,
La.; Greenville, Miss.; Buffalo, N.Y.; McAllen and El Paso, Texas; and
Cleveland.

Clinton also announced the release of $ 116 million to 553 police departments
under the regular police-hiring program. This will allow for the hiring of 1,748
officers, bringing to more than 75,000 the number of police officers hired under
the program.

He said the program was also under budget, raising the possibility that more
than 100,000 officers could be hired under the program.

Topic: CRIME ON CAMPUS;
Colleges are taking crime more seriously

BYLINE: Pat Ordovensky

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 15A

LENGTH: 664 words


Michael Clay Smith, 46, is university legal counsel and associate professor of
criminal justice and higher education administration at the University of
Southern Mississippi at Hattiesburg. Smith, a former district attorney and chief
deputy attorney general of West Virginia, is the author of Coping with Crime on
Campus. He was interviewed by USA TODAY's Pat Ordovensky.

 USA TODAY: In the past, colleges and universities have been reluctant to report
crimes on campus. Has that started to change?

SMITH: All of a sudden, within the last few months, my sense is that colleges
and universities are recognizing that it's appropriate that they be honest about
crime statistics, rather than explicitly or implicitly covering them up.

 USA TODAY: You're saying university officials were covering up?

SMITH: For a long time, they were covering up - sometimes out of simple bad
faith, other times out of a benign attempt to ignore the whole problem.

 USA TODAY: Why do you think this is changing?

SMITH: The first thing is all this publicity by the press. It has raised the
consciousness of administrators about the problem. College presidents are
basically public relations people. They don't worry about how many assaults or
abductions or break-ins there are. But when it's on the front page of USA TODAY
they start to worry about it.

 USA TODAY: Is that because parents are concerned about campus crime?

SMITH: When my little girls go to college in a few years, one of the things I'm
going to look at is how safe the place is. A few years ago, I'd be looking only
at academics. The presidents are starting to realize that safety is an issue in
attracting warm bodies to their campuses. With the constituencies of colleges
and universities concerned about it, the administrators have to be concerned.

 USA TODAY: Could it be that they weren't aware of the problem?

SMITH: Really, many administrators were not aware of the extent of the problem
because they weren't asking the right questions. And those on campus who knew
the extent of the problem had no way through the existing administrative
machinery to get anyone to pay attention to them. The publicity made
administrators aware of the extent of crime. It has also made them aware of the
lawsuit liability against their institutions and against them personally.

 USA TODAY: Is there a liability for failure to warn students about crime?

SMITH: If they fail to warn when they should warn, and if they fail to provide
adequate protection. Courts have held universities and specific vice presidents
liable in large damage suits by students injured in crime. In each of those
cases, the college knew of the crime problem but failed to disclose the hazard
and failed to provide adequate security. The legal word involved is
''forseeability.'' Juries found it was foreseeable to the university in each of
those cases that the subsequent crime would happen, yet they failed to warn and
failed to protect.

 USA TODAY: How reliable are the crime statistics we're now getting?

SMITH: All crime statistics are unreliable. Crime studies show only about 50% of
all felonies are ever reported to the police. There is a lot of politics that
goes into reporting crime statistics, and that's more true on campuses. It may
not be that an order came down from a vice president to hide crime statistics,
but rather that the police chief or someone sensed what would happen if figures
got out that were rather high.

 USA TODAY: What would they be afraid of?

SMITH: It would not only alarm and upset the administrators, but it might look
like campus security wasn't doing a very good job. Administrators are
desperately trying new ways to recruit students, and that's antithetical to
saying to a student, ''We want you to come, but it's a dangerous place if you
get here.''

 USA TODAY: Last year, a law was passed in Pennsylvania requiring colleges to
report crimes. Will the threat of similar laws have any effect in other states?

SMITH: More are coming to see that as less of a threat. If everybody's got to do
it, then it will be OK if we do it. It sort of gets people off the hook.

 USA TODAY: Do you think more states will pass these laws?

SMITH: It's going to become law in more places. I don't think the colleges are
going to fight it. They don't dare. It'll just look too bad. College
administrators really want to do the right thing, and it's easier if everybody
has to do it.

Metro transit crime down but tops other cities;
Metro's crime rate has declined from 2010 but still tops transit systems in
other cities

SECTION: A; Pg.4

LENGTH: 228  words


WASHINGTON (AP) - Metro says serious crime has declined on the Washington-area
transit system from 2010, but its crime rate was still higher last year than at
five other major transit agencies.

Metro released a five-year crime report Wednesday. It listed 1,898 serious
crimes last year, the majority of them thefts of some kind. Last year's figure
was a decline from a six-year high of 2,270 crimes in 2010.

There was a five-year lows in 2011 for crimes on buses and in parking lots and
for motor vehicle thefts, according to the report.

The Washington Examiner (http://bit.ly/xHwAb9 ) reports Metro's crime rate is
still higher than that in statistics from transit agencies in New York, Los
Angeles, Boston, Atlanta and Philadelphia.

Metro had 5.52 crimes per million riders, while New York's vast subway system
had 1.55 crimes per million trips.

But Metro spokesman Dan Stessel says it's nearly impossible to draw clear
comparisons without knowing how each transit agency reports crime.

Some agencies, like New York City, don't have parking facilities to patrol,
while many of Metro's serious crimes are related to parking lots, Stessel said.
Some transit agencies, including New York and Los Angeles, don't have their own
police departments, so that can affect how crimes are reported and counted, for
example, if a crime happens on a sidewalk near a subway station, he said.

Put officers where most crimes occur

SECTION: EDITORIAL; Pg. A4

LENGTH: 365  words


The recent spate of murders in Durham is a sobering reminder that crime is a
tenacious problem. Progress will take a smart, consistent effort over many
years. We can't allow ourselves to get discouraged.

Durham is hardly alone in its battle. Every city has crime, and many are worse
off than Durham. A disheartening trend in many cities that had been making gains
against crime is that the gains are being reversed. Violent crime is on the
upswing in many cities, including Baltimore, Atlanta, Philadelphia, Washington,
D.C., and Oakland, Calif.

Fortunately, in Durham, the statistics in most areas are declining. Overall
crime was down 10 percent in the first quarter of 2007 as compared to 2006.
Violent crime fell by 8 percent and property crime was down by 10 percent. The
exception was a 10 percent increase in assaults.

We need to keep crime trends moving in a downward direction. So we were pleased
that the City Police Department is using methods that have been working in other
cities -- most notably New York and Los Angeles -- to make solid, measurable
progress against crime.

Using a statistical analysis, the Durham Police Department has identified a
two-square-mile area that is the most affected by crime in the Bull City. It is
probably no surprise that the area is in Northeast Central Durham, around Alston
and Angier avenues. The area has the most reports of shots fired, the most
violent crime incidents and the most gang members in residence, police say. It
also accounts for 19.8 percent of the city's violent gun crimes.

Speaking to a recent meeting of the Religious Coalition for a Nonviolent Durham,
Police Major Jim Bjurstrom outlined the program.

"We finally really focused on the numbers and we have a plan for what we need to
do," he said.

Police didn't want to release any further details about their activities in the
neighborhood, presumably so as not to tip off the criminals. But the idea --
targeting areas where the crime occurs -- makes a great deal of sense. We hope
the Police Department sharply increases the number of officers in the area to
drive out the violent criminals. And we hope police officials will soon be ready
to share the results with the public.

Stadium safety survey: Turner Field area is worst

BYLINE: Lyda Longa, Staff

SECTION: Local News; Pg. 1E

LENGTH: 670 words

A new study that looks at safety around baseball parks across the country found
that the communities surrounding Turner Field collectively have the highest
incidences of violent crime, followed closely by ballparks in Chicago and New
York.

The survey, completed last month by Philadelphia-based Crimes Against Persons
Index, looked at areas around 28 major ballparks and stadiums in the United
States. The statistics were garnered from socioeconomic information from census
tracts, and 10 years of incident reports from police departments in each city
surveyed.

The neighborhoods included in the study however, stretch as far as six miles
from each stadium.

Turner Field, Comiskey Park in Chicago, Yankee Stadium in New York and the major
ballparks in St. Louis and Baltimore took the top ratings in the survey.  The
stadium with the safest surroundings is The Ballpark in Arlington, Texas.  The
field is in a suburb surrounded mostly by massive parking lots.

Although the immediate area surrounding Turner Field is a mixed residential
landscape that includes high-end townhomes and the Victorian charm of Grant
Park, the neighborhoods located farther out include some of the city's toughest
streets.

Nonetheless, critics of the study say that is too wide an area to form a proper
assessment of crime around Turner Field.

"I don't buy it," said Paul Zucca, chairman of Neighborhood Planning Unit W, the
group that covers Grant Park and East Atlanta. "I'm sure you would have crimes
committed in the area when you have 50,000 people at Turner Field and when you
have thousands of people visiting other attractions in the area. But I think a
six-mile swath is too wide an area to be effective to the stadium."

Officials at Turner Field and Comiskey Park in Chicago, rated the second most
dangerous, said using a decade's worth of police reports for the survey's
results is misleading because inner cities change significantly. Spokesmen for
both parks said their stadiums are heavily protected by police - -- including
off-duty officers --- on game days.

But CAP Index chairman Robert Figlio said the danger of becoming a victim of a
violent crime near a stadium is strongest when there are no events at the
ballpark.

Obviously, if the neighborhoods located six miles from the stadiums are to be
included, said Atlanta police spokesman John Quigley, then certainly some of
Atlanta's worst areas --- such as The Bluff in Zone 1 and Metropolitan Parkway
in Zone 3 --- qualify for the study.

"It's ludicrous to include such a large area," Quigley said. "The area inside a
circle with a six-mile radius is 113 square miles. This entire city is 131
square miles. The radius they look at includes significant portions of DeKalb
County, most of East Point and some portions of College Park."

But crime travels, Figlio said, and a stadium, like a mall, is not just
patronized by the people who live closest to it.

"Obviously crime occurring in the inner bands closest to the stadium would be
the most significant, but there is also crime closer to the outer bands of each
stadium's radius," Figlio said. "Crime moves and affects the areas closest to
the stadium."

Joe Perry, a revitalization activist who also works with a church ministry group
in Summer Hill, one of the neighborhoods closest to the stadium undergoing a
major face lift, agreed. Perry believes most of the crimes committed in the area
near the ballpark are the handiwork of non-residents.

"The stadium is in the inner city and that will bring problems," Perry said.
"There is a lot of revitalization in the area with beautiful homes going up. But
there are also some dilapidated sections. I do believe criminals come in from
the outside because they perceive the stadium attracts people with money."

'Plague' of crime hits rural areas

BYLINE: Sam Vincent Meddis; Rebecca Buckman

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 11A

LENGTH: 316 words


Small-town USA is losing its relative immunity to drugs and violence, according
to a new Senate report that found an ''astonishing'' increase in rural crime.

''America's rural towns, villages and small communities are suffering a plague
of violent crime, drug trafficking and drug abuse,'' says Sen. Joseph Biden Jr.,
D-Del., chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who announced a bill Tuesday
to combat the trend.

While total crime is still significantly lower in rural areas, the crime rate
increase there surpasses many urban states, the report said. Among the findings:

- Most rural states - those with 50 persons or fewer per square mile - had
greater increases in violent crime over the past year than did New York City.

- One of every 10 cocaine addicts lives in a rural state.

Drug dealers are increasingly moving out of major cities into rural areas
''looking for new, fertile territories,'' says director Michael Gimbel of the
Office of Substance Abuse in Baltimore.

''We're not immune from anything,'' says Helena, Mont., assistant police chief
Michael Bloom. ''Drugs and alcohol problems ... have really influenced
(domestic) violence.''

Tom Pagel of Wyoming's Division of Criminal Investigation sees ''a much greater
propensity for weapons in drug offenses than we used to.''

Biden's bill would provide $ 50 million to increase drug treatment and
prevention programs, and $ 50 million for state, local law enforcement. Also, it
would create rural task forces of federal and local law enforcement officials,
while allocating $ 45 million to hire at least 350 Drug Enforcement
Administration personnel to expand rural probes.

But increased law enforcement efforts could increase the violence by upping the
potential profits from drug dealing, warns Arnold Trebach, author of The Great
Drug War. ''It's going to feed the more violent nature of some people.''

Pataki Says He Delivered on Promises; Experts Aren't So Sure

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ

SECTION: Section B; Page 6; Column 1; Metropolitan Desk

LENGTH: 743 words

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 7


Gov. George E. Pataki used his election-year address to the Legislature today to
remind New Yorkers that he had delivered on the major campaign pledges he made
four years ago: creating jobs, reducing crime, cutting taxes and shrinking the
welfare rolls.

But interviews with experts in each of those areas raise questions about some of
the Governor's claims. Here are some of the victories Mr. Pataki touted, and the
experts' assessments:

Crime

Mr. Pataki boasted that the streets of New York State are far safer today than
they were three years ago, when, he said, the state led the nation in violent
crimes. But according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, New York's rate of
violent crime three years ago was really seventh, behind Florida, California,
South Carolina, Nevada, Louisiana and the District of Columbia.

Mr. Pataki also claimed that the tough anti-crime measures he pushed through the
Legislature, particularly the enactment of the death penalty and the elimination
of parole for violent offenders convicted for a second time, had contributed to
the state's plummeting crime rates.

But most experts say that a direct link between enacting the death penalty and
deterring crime is difficult to prove, and that the parole change, enacted in
1995, is too new to have had any effect. They also say that the state's drop in
crime has been driven by trends in New York City, where Mayor Rudolph W.
Giuliani has employed new and aggressive police strategies.

For instance, there were 1,171 fewer murders in New York City in 1996 than in
1991; statewide, there were 1,214 fewer murders in 1996 than in 1991.

"No one attributes the drop in crime in New York City to policies coming out of
Albany," said Robert Gangi, executive director of the Correctional Association
of New York. "Rather, it's a result of demographic patterns, new police
strategies and a truce among rival drug gangs."

Job Creation

 Jobs will surely be a major campaign issue this year, and Mr. Pataki today
touted New York as a leader in job creation since he took office. "When I was
elected, New York State was 49th in the nation in creating jobs," he said. "Now
we are sixth."

But economists said the numbers Mr. Pataki cited were a bit misleading. New York
did indeed create more jobs in absolute numbers, 236,400, between 1994 and 1997.
But in terms of percentages, New York went from 48th to 42d in job growth during
those years, according to the Fiscal Policy Institute.

"Counting jobs is inappropriate for state-by-state comparisons," said Jennifer
McCormick, an analyst with the Fiscal Policy Institute. "Using this measure, the
third most populous state, New York, has to eke out a 1 percent increase to beat
out the 38th most populous, Nevada's 6 percent employment increase."

Taxes

 One of the Governor's least disputed claims was his assertion that New York
State had become a leader in cutting taxes. "We've cut so many taxes -- in so
many different ways and so many times -- that it would take me 10 minutes just
to read you the list," he said.

According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, New York has led
other states in cutting taxes for the three years that Mr. Pataki has been in
office: $944 million between 1995 and 1996; $1.9 billion between 1996 and 1997
and $803 million between 1997 and 1998. In all, New York's tax cuts amounted to
more than 38 percent of the $10 billion in tax cuts enacted nationwide in the
three years.

"Those are very impressive figures," said Ronald K. Snell, the director of the
economic and fiscal division for the conference of legislatures.

Welfare

 The Governor said his administration had succeeded in freeing many people
trapped in a culture of dependency fostered by old welfare programs. He said the
number of people on public assistance had been reduced by 456,000, to 1,191,000
from 1,647,000, since he took office.

The numbers have indeed plummeted, but many experts contend that the numbers
have been largely driven by experiments in welfare overhaul by local
governments, though some of those programs required approval by the state.

In New York City, the rolls have declined by 338,000, to 822,117 from 1,160,593
three years ago. "The city's welfare program has driven the state decline," said
Tony Coles, Mayor Giuliani's welfare adviser. "But the Governor has been helpful
in advocating legislation that has been helpful to our program."

Get tough on teen crime? Look close;
there's a catch

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 12A

LENGTH: 295 words


Gun-toting teens are a popular target for people's fears about crime. Just ask
people who responded to a new USA TODAY/CNN poll.

They're plainly frightened by the rise in violent crime over the past five
years, especially by youthful offenders. And high among the solutions they
support is treating more youthful offenders as adults.

That get-tough call is the same as people have demanded on other aspects of the
crime problem.

Since 1980, state and federal authorities, responding to public worries about
drugs, have enacted stiffer and stiffer sentences for drug-related crimes. But
stop a moment for some questions:

Why has violent crime in Wisconsin doubled along with its incarceration rate?

Why has California's violent crime rate spiked up by two-thirds since 1975 as
the state quadrupled the rate of incarceration?

Why, after billions have been spent to triple the prison population since 1980,
don't we feel safe?

And why should we believe that trying teens as young as 13 in adult courts and
giving them the same sentences and treatment as adult criminals will work any
better?

More hope lies in approaches that focus on community-based efforts to steer
teens away from crime - a growing trend around the country.

Black men in Milwaukee and students from Rutgers University in New Jersey, for
instance, donate time to tutoring potential problem youngsters.

Time will be needed to measure the success of such programs. But they certainly
make more sense than tossing more money at solutions that are failing.

It should be obvious by now that the answer to crime won't be found only in law
books or cell blocks. The solution begins with families and communities, and
until some answers emerge from them, crime is only likely to get worse.

WASHINGTON WHITES FOUND MORE LIKELY TO BE CRIME VICTIMS

BYLINE: AP

SECTION: Section B; Page 9, Column 1; National Desk

LENGTH: 427 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 29


White residents of the nation's capital are almost twice as likely as black
residents to be victims of violent crimes, which contradicts the national trend
in urban crime, according to a Government study released today.

The Bureau of Justice Statistics study found that 110.2 white people per 1,000
said they were were victims of violent crimes in Washington, as against 57.4
black people per 1,000.

The findings were based on interviews with a random sample of District of
Columbia residents who were 12 years old and older. Based on the 1980 census, 70
percent of Washington's 668,000 people are black.

The crimes in the study included robbery and assault, but not murder, in the
period May 1982 to April 1983. The interviews were conducted from May 1983 to
August 1983.

The study focused on which people are victimized by certain crimes, rather than
on whether crime generally is going up or down.

Gary L. Abrecht, director of planning and development for the District of
Columbia Police Department, said: ''I would be very surprised if it were true.
Our figures would not support such a large disparity.''

Whites are victimized by robbery in the city at a considerably greater rate than
blacks, Mr. Abrecht said, but blacks are much more likely to be victims of
homicide and rapes.

Education Also Weighed

The study, conducted for the statistics bureau by the Research Triangle
Institute of Research Triangle Park, N.C., also found that Washington residents
with more than a high school education were crime victims almost twice as often
as Washington residents who had less education, 92 people per 1,000 as against
49 people per 1,000.

Analysts in the study weighed such factors as education levels of victims in
Washington but could not explain the racial trends.

An analyst for the statistics bureau, Patrick Langan, said the findings were not
unique to Washington, even though they go against the national trend.

Previous surveys showed that blacks were more often the victims of crimes in
Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Baltimore,
Cleveland, Dallas, Denver, Newark, Portland, Ore., and St. Louis.

The study also compared crimes in the capital to crimes reported by residents in
nearby suburbs in Maryland and Virginia and in other cities.

Black people in nearby suburbs appeared to be victims of violent crimes more
often than white people: 72.7 black people per 1,000 as against 59.1 white
people per 1,000. The results were based on interviews with people living in
Maryland and Virginia suburbs.

Crime survey cites city Publisher says St. Louis is the second-worst city for
crimes in the nation. Mayor's office calls the survey 'totally bogus.'

ST. LOUIS - The city is once again the runner-up in a yearly ranking of the
worst U.S. cities for crime.

An always-controversial report released over the weekend by publishing firm CQ
Press ranked St. Louis in second place behind Camden, N.J.

Last year's list put St. Louis at No. 4.

The publisher's 16th annual report ranks 393 cities (with at least 75,000
people) based on 2008 crime statistics published by the FBI. Rounding out the
top five worst cities for crime are other familiar names on CQ's list: Oakland,
Calif., Detroit, and Flint, Mich., respectively.

In 2006, St. Louis was labeled worst in the nation for crime - just ahead of
Detroit - shortly after the St. Louis Cardinals defeated the Detroit Tigers in
the World Series. In 2007, St. Louis had the No. 2 spot.

This year, New Orleans - which earned the unwanted tag of having the most crime
in last year's rankings - dropped to sixth worst.

The city with the best ranking this year is Colonie, N.Y., a suburb of Albany.

O'Fallon, Mo., which had enjoyed a third-best crime ranking in last year's
ranking, dropped to 14th best.

The publishing firm also ranked the largest 332 metropolitan areas. St. Louis
came in at 103. (Pine Bluff, Ark., had the worst ranking, and metropolitan State
College, Pa., had the best.) Last year was the first time the publisher
eliminated the "most dangerous" label, which critics have called inaccurate and
inflammatory.

CQ Press defends the yearly ranking by saying it raises awareness about crime by
analyzing the most comprehensive collection of available crime data. But
criminologists and city officials, especially those whose cities fare poorly,
routinely blast the list as meaningless and damaging to cities' reputations. The
FBI also warns against city-by-city comparisons because cities compile
statistics differently.

On Sunday, Kara Bowlin, a spokeswoman for Mayor Francis Slay, called the ranking
"stupid" and "totally bogus." She said the yearly ranking hurts tourism and
business and fails to present an adequate picture of crime in St. Louis.

"It gives people a scary image of St. Louis," Bowlin said, pointing to dropping
crime rates in St. Louis over the past three years. Crime was down about 9
percent in the city in 2008 from the previous year, and 15 percent from 2006 to
2007.

CQ's rankings are based on FBI crime data for murder, rape, robbery, assault,
burglary and auto theft.

Violent crime on rise for first time in 5 years

BYLINE: Maria Newman

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 6

LENGTH: 390 words


Violent crime increased last year in the United States for the first time in
five years, up 2.5 percent from the year before, with the biggest increases in
murder in the nation's medium-size cities and in the Midwest.

A preliminary 2005 crime report issued by the Federal Bureau of Investigation
shows the total number of murders went up 4.8 percent from the year before. St.
Louis, Missouri; Houston, Philadelphia and Milwaukee saw an increase in the
number of murders, while cities such as New York, Los Angeles and Miami saw a
decline.

In the violent crime category, only rape saw a decrease, falling by 1.9 percent.
Robberies increased overall by 4.5 percent. Cities with populations of more than
500,000 people saw the biggest rise in violent crime, with an increase of 8.3
percent. In the Midwest, violent crimes increased by 5.7 percent.

After years of declining numbers, law enforcement officials and other experts on
crime cautioned that this latest report does not necessarily mean crime will
start to run rampant again.

James Alan Fox, a professor of criminal justice at Northeastern University in
Boston, said that, after dramatic decreases during the 1990s, the crime rate
overall from 2000 to 2004 was ''essentially flat.''

''Now the challenge isn't so much to make the crime rate go down more, because
that's not necessarily realistic, but the challenge is to make sure that the
small blip doesn't become a big one,'' he said.

He also noted that some cities where murders went up in 2005 have seen small
fluctuations in recent years.

The FBI annual report is drawn from reports gathered by state and local law
enforcement agencies around the country. They measure four violent offenses
(murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault) and four property crimes
(burglary, larceny, auto theft and arson). It does not measure drug crimes.

The report showed that cities with populations from 100,000 to 249,999 had the
greatest increase in the number of murders, up 12.5 percent. Cities with 500,000
to 999,999 inhabitants experienced the greatest increases in both robbery, 9.9
percent, and aggravated assault, 8.5 percent.

The number of offenses of forcible rape decreased in all city population groups,
except in those cities with fewer than 10,000 residents, where the number of
forcible rape offenses was up 1.5 percent from the 2004 level.

Violent crime on the rise

BYLINE: Reuters

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. B8

LENGTH: 429  words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON


WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- More murders and robberies in 2006 sent U.S. violent
crimes higher for the second straight year, the FBI said Monday, with the
increase blamed on gangs, youth violence, gun crimes and fewer police on beats.

The FBI reported that the number of violent crimes nationwide went up by 1.3
percent last year, following a 2.3 percent increase in 2005. That had been the
first rise in four years and the biggest percentage gain in 15 years.

The report showed that murders in big cities jumped last year by 6.7 percent.
Robberies, an important indicator of crime trends, increased 6 percent
nationwide.

Cities with big increases in the number of murders included Orlando and Miami in
Florida; Oakland and San Diego in California; Phoenix, Ariz.; Corpus Christi,
Tex.; Grand Rapids, Mich.; Reno, Nev., and Little Rock, Ark.

Even though the higher violent crime numbers had been expected, they still
represented bad news for Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, who has targeted
violent crime as a top priority for the U.S. Justice Department.

A department study released last month of 18 metropolitan areas cited more
violence by local gangs or street crews, a greater prevalence of guns in the
hands of criminals and younger, more violent offenders as key reasons for the
rising crime rates.

Criminologists agreed with those reasons and also said there are fewer police on
the beat. They cited the Bush administration's shift in emphasis to prevent
terrorism since the Sept. 11 attacks and funding cuts for programs to put more
police officers on the street.

"The fact that we are seeing these increases several years in a row should be a
wake-up call,'' said James Alan Fox, a professor of criminal justice at
Northeastern University in Boston.

"There's a tendency to think the sky is falling. It's not,'' said Fox, noting
the increases have been relatively small. ''We're not talking about an epidemic
here.''

David Kennedy, director of the Center for Crime Prevention and Control at the
John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, said the crime problems appear
to be spreading to medium-sized and smaller cities.

He said the emergence of deadly drug crews or street gangs can have a
potentially profound impact on a city's homicide or gun assault rate.

Lawrence Sherman, director of a criminology center at the University of
Pennsylvania, called it an unusual pattern that murder is going up in some big
cities, down in others.

One possible explanation is that some police departments are doing much more to
catch people illegally carrying concealed weapons, he said.

Sure, crime's on the decline. That doesn't mean we shouldn't fight it

It wasn't long after Shawn Beauchamp was released from prison, having served a
40-month term for breaking and entering, assault and robbery, that he was shot
to death in Winnipeg's North End. Mr. Beauchamp, 26, was a former gang member
apparently trying to go straight. "He wanted to quit the gang," his cousin told
the CBC. "But the only way you get out of the gang is in a box."

Mr. Beauchamp was Winnipeg's first homicide victim of 2009. That year,
Manitoba's capital would go on to claim the title as Canada's deadliest big
city, with a record 32 homicides in the urban area and its suburbs. It also took
the crown in 2008, and though the rate dropped last year, the city is already on
track to eclipse its previous record: Six people have been killed so far in
2011.

In the debate over the federal government's tough-on-crime bills, the standard
response of opponents has been to point to one fact: Crime in Canada is falling.
But averages hide a lot of variations. A deeper look at the country's crime
statistics reveals a more complex picture - and may help to explain the appeal
that a tough-on-crime stance has for the Conservatives and their core voters.

Where is crime highest in Canada? In the West, the Tory heartland. Statistics
Canada's crime-severity index, a measure combining the number of offences and
their seriousness, shows crime still high in the West. Saskatchewan, the
province with the highest overall index score, was roughly twice as crime-ridden
as Ontario or Quebec in 2009. Manitoba, which topped the index, had more than
twice as much violent crime as Ontario or Quebec.

And the discrepancy is not just East-West. It is also North-South. Crime rates
in the United States have been plummeting for two decades, dropping far faster
than in Canada. In fact, crime has fallen to such a degree in the U.S. that a
comparison of data for the most recent year available, 2009, reveals that some
cities in Western Canada are now more dangerous than many in the U.S.

For example, Winnipeg's homicide rate is more than double that of the nearest
big U.S. city, Minneapolis-St. Paul. Its rate is higher than Boston's. Higher
than San Diego's. It's even slightly higher than New York's, if you include the
Big Apple's suburbs.

And Winnipeg is not alone. You're more likely to be murdered in Edmonton than in
the much larger cities of San Jose, Calif., Salt Lake City, Utah, or Austin,
Tex. The homicide rate in Vancouver is higher than in Portland, Ore., and the
same as in neighbouring Seattle. In 2009, Edmonton, Winnipeg and Vancouver had
higher homicide rates than almost any city in the Northwestern U.S.

Crime rates are much lower east of Manitoba and, as a result, relative to
population, Canada has only about a third as many homicides as the United
States. (Homicide is often used as a proxy for crime when doing comparisons
because, unlike with other crimes, there are no problems of reporting,
definitions or fudging of data.) This is another argument that critics of the
Conservative crime strategy repeatedly make: Over all, crime rates are still
lower in Canada than in the U.S.

The U.S. comparison may be flattering to Canada, but it's not the ideal
benchmark. Why not? Because the U.S. is still the most crime-ridden country in
the developed world. Aiming no higher is setting the bar pretty low. (And, as
Western Canada shows, sometimes we're not even clearing that hurdle.)

The homicide rate in Canada is higher than that of most industrialized
countries, often by wide margins. We have 39 per cent more homicides per capita
than Australia, 41 per cent more than the United Kingdom, 50 per cent more than
Poland, twice as many as Sweden, three times as many as Norway and nearly four
times as many as Japan.

And Canada has no reason to be smug about crime when compared with what could be
the best standard of all: Canada. According to Statscan, the crime rate today is
more than double what it was in the early 1960s. And the rate of violent crime
is more than four times higher. The homicide rate? About a third higher. Yes,
crime has been on the decline since the 1990s. But that's only after shooting up
over the previous three decades.

All of which doesn't mean that the crime-reduction measures proposed by the
Tories are necessarily the right ones. But anyone who claims that the government
is going after a problem that doesn't exist - anyone who says, 'Move along, no
crime to see here' - isn't telling the truth.

Another argument you hear in the Canadian crime debate: The U.S. experience
proves incarceration doesn't reduce crime. A generation ago, the U.S. decided to
fight crime by imprisoning more criminals, ending up with more people behind
bars than almost any country on Earth. Yet it still has high rates of violent
crime. Ergo, imprisonment doesn't work. If anything, imprisonment increases
crime. Right?

Maybe not. The American strategy has been exceptionally expensive and has had
deeply unpleasant side effects, but when it comes to reducing crime, it appears
to have worked, at least somewhat. According to University of Chicago economist
Steven Levitt, who spent much of his time analyzing crime data before he became
famous for co-writing Freakonomics, the sharp increase in the number of
Americans in prison and the sharp drop in U.S. crime are closely related. His
research says the former helped cause the latter by deterrence and through
"incapacitation," a creepy technical term for the fact that someone cannot rob
your house while he is locked up in the Big House.

In a 2004 study, Prof. Levitt concluded that the growing number of Americans
behind bars was responsible for about one-third of the enormous drop in crime in
the 1990s. (Other factors he identified were the hiring of more police, the end
of the crack epidemic and, controversially, the legalization of abortion - which
ensured that fewer unwanted children were born.)

Many American scholars disagree with Prof. Levitt, and there's a real debate
over why crime has fallen in the U.S. It's exactly the kind of serious debate
that we should have in Canada. The government hasn't exactly been promoting
thoughtful discussion, but neither have its "crime-what-crime?" critics.

Canada's crime problem is hardly an out-of-control epidemic. It's not even a
crisis, except in a few places such as Winnipeg. It's a problem that has been
trending, slowly, in the right direction. But it's a bit premature to be
declaring victory. More than two million crimes were reported to the police in
2009, including 443,000 violent crimes, 205,000 break-ins and 108,000
motor-vehicle thefts. And those figures greatly understate the problem:
According to Statscan's most recent survey of victims, only 31 per cent of
criminal incidents were reported to police in 2009, down from 37 per cent in
1999.

The numbers sure don't sound like a clarion call to complacency.

CRIMES DECLINE IN CITIES, SAYS FBI; ST. LOUIS, ST. LOUIS COUNTY AMONG AREAS WITH
DROPS

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 276 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON


Violent crime in large U.S. cities dropped 8 percent in 1995, leading the way
for a less dramatic decline across the nation, the FBI reports.

The annual crime survey by the FBI also shows the lowest murder rate in a decade
- and the lowest overall violent crime rate since 1989.

St. Louis had 205 homicides in 1995, a 19 percent drop from 1994, and the lowest
total since 1990.

The crime rate in the city, including both property and violent crimes, declined
by 4.5 percent in 1995. The city had 14,289 violent crimes in 1994 and 12,103 in
1995.

In St. Louis County, the number of most violent crimes dropped in 1995. The only
exception was homicides.

The county had 42 slayings in 1995, the same as in 1994, both down from 61
homicides in 1993.

In Missouri, violent crimes dropped 9.9 percent, while the murder rate dropped
16.2 percent.

The FBI compiles it's report from about 16,000 law enforcement agencies
nationwide. It was released Saturday.

Attorney General Janet Reno attributed the apparently improved statistics to
"many different causes, including our bipartisan efforts to give local law
enforcement the tools they need to combat crime."

Reno warned, however: "This is no time to rest on our laurels. Crime is still
too high."

The 8 percent drop in violent crimes the 1-million-plus cities - Phoenix, Los
Angeles, San Diego, Chicago, New York, Philadelphia, Dallas and Houston - was
the second consecutive year of decline.

Violent crimes include murder, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated assault.
The number dropped 3 percent nationally; the rate of crimes per 100,000 people
dropped 4 percent nationally.

FEDERAL GRANTS TO HELP COMMUNITIES HIRE MORE POLICE;
 PRESIDENT CLINTON SAYS THE AID WILL GO TO CITIES THAT AREN'T ENJOYING THE
NATIONAL DECLINE IN CRIMES.

BYLINE: Associated Press

SECTION: FRONT, Pg. 4A

DATELINE: WASHINGTON


To help communities that have not shared in the nation's falling crime rate,
President Clinton said Friday the Justice Department will provide money to help
hire 700 more police officers to walk the beat in 18 American cities.

''There are still some neighborhoods in America, and too many of them, where
crime hasn't receded far enough or fast enough,'' Clinton, flanked by a dozen
uniformed officers, said in a Rose Garden announcement.

Nationwide, the crime rate is at its lowest point in 25 years, Clinton said, but
that has not eased problems in some urban pockets. Hartford, Conn., for example,
has seen a new surge in violent gang activity, he said.

''We have to focus our resources on high-crime, high-need neighborhoods to bring
the benefits of community policing to every area. In the difficult areas, that
means we have to reach a critical mass of police officers and community policing
before it can make the necessary difference,'' he added.

Offering a few examples, the president said Chicago's police department would
get an extra 150 officers to fight drug-related crimes, Miami would get another
170 to take back the streets along the Miami River, and Baltimore an extra 100
to fight drugs.

The Justice Department grants are being offered under the COPS community
policing program. That program, which seeks to put 100,000 extra police officers
on the streets, was part of the 1994 crime law.

The new grants are more flexible than the original COPS grants, officials said.
With these grants, police can use the funds to target a special problem, such as
drug activity or gangs, in a particular community.

Cities receiving grants are Baltimore; Bessemer, Ala.; Birmingham, Ala.;
Buffalo, N.Y.; Camden, N.J.; Chicago; Cleveland; El Paso, Texas; Flint, Mich.;
Fort Pierce, Fla.; Fresno, Calif.; Greenville, Miss.; Hartford, Conn.; McAllen,
Texas; Miami; Monroe, La.; Muskegon, Mich.; and San Bernardino, Calif.

Those cities were chosen because they have high rates of both crime and poverty,
a White House official said.

Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., an author of the 1994 law, said the grants can
only help a declining trend in crime to continue.

''The crime bill was the first national policy on crime, and the results are
clear: Crime is down 20 percent across America,'' Schumer said. ''By 1999, the
crime bill will have put 100,000 new cops on America's streets. That makes
everyone feel safer - except criminals.''

The latest grants will help bring the number of new officers to 75,000, Clinton
said.

ST. LOUIS AMONG MOST VIOLENT CITIES IN U.S.; ALTHOUGH CITY CRIME RANKED 2ND IN
'94, IT DROPPED SLIGHTLY, FBI SAYS

BYLINE: Michael D. Sorkin Data Analysis By Jim Mosley Of the Post-Dispatch Staff

St. Louis was the second most violent city in the United States last year.

It nearly reached Newark's record as the most violent place in the country,
according to FBI statistics analyzed by the Post-Dispatch.

The analysis compares violent crimes - murder, rape, robbery and assault - with
the population sizes of 193 municipalities.

Nationwide, crime dropped last year. In St. Louis, violent crime dropped 2
percent.

Even so, St. Louis had more violent crimes for its population size than bigger
cities with reputations for violence: Atlanta, Miami, Chicago, Washington, New
York and Los Angeles.

Nationwide, the city's murder rate ranked fifth. s

"People have a right to be scared, and they have a right to be angry," said
Mayor Freeman Bosley Jr.

While crime is down slightly, fear of crime is up, Bosley said. People are
angry, he added, over recent high-profile murders:

- Russian immigrant Olga Maxiaeva, 27, was driving home on Interstate 64
(Highway 40) Feb. 20 when someone dropped a huge rock from an overpass through
her windshield. .

- Architect Jeffrey Krewson, 42, was parking his car March 23 in front of his
family's home in the Central West End. As his wife and two children sat in the
back, a carjacker shot Krewson in the neck.

- Melissa Gail Aptman, 22, was leaving a restaurant in the city's Dogtown
neighborhood May 5, two weeks before she was to graduate from Washington
University. Two carjackers shot her, then shot and raped her girlfriend, 20. The
girlfriend survived.

- Travis Charleston, 16, a sophomore and ROTC student at Beaumont High, was in a
car at a service station at North Grand Boulevard and Natural Bridge Avenue when
he was mistaken for another youth and shot.

Charleston was one of nine people shot in a 13-hour period two weekends ago.
Five of the victims were ages 14 to 16.

Police Chief Clarence Harmon said his department has taken steps, and will take
more, to fight crime:

Creating more foot and bike patrols, targeting high crime areas and working on a
crisis intervention program to steer families to social service agencies.

Although St. Louis is building more prisons and putting more police on the
streets, Harmon said, that's not the answer.

In the long run, he said, nothing is likely to change unless the city develops
what he called a Marshall Plan to deal with the causes of crime:

Poverty, teen-age pregnancy, high-school dropouts, the lack of family values,
the city's eroding tax base and a population that continues to decline as its
residents flee.

"Those are not all cop problems," he said.

Bosley sounded a similar theme:

"You could put a police officer on every corner and you wouldn't solve the
problem," he said.

He noted plans to build new jails in the state, including a city jail downtown.

"After these jails are built, people will be standing in line to get in them,"
Bosley said. "More people will be arrested, more people will be arrested, more
people will be sentenced."

None of that will end violence, and government can't stop crime, Bosley said.

He asked: How can you prevent homicide, a crime of passion?

The solutions, if there are any, he said, will come from families, schools and
churches - places where respect can be taught.

"We've got to face the stark reality that we've got a lot of people who don't
have structure in their lives, who don't have a sense of responsibility and
don't have respect for other people."

Mapping Crime Hot Spots

SECTION: Section 4; Page 8; Column 1; Editorial Desk

LENGTH: 400 words


Making police commanders accountable for crime reduction may seem
common-sensical, but it is not routine in most police departments around the
country. The New York Police Department, which now operates under this
principle, offers proof to other cities that it can be effective.

The strategy relies heavily on the use of computers to pinpoint hot spots of
crime so that precinct commanders can respond quickly to squelch the outbreak.
This approach is at least partially responsible for the city's dramatic decline
in crime rates. Jack Maple, a deputy under former Police Commissioner William
Bratton, developed the method and has spread word of its impact to other urban
centers with daunting crime problems. In New Orleans and Newark, his tactics are
getting impressive results, in part because they force officers out onto the
streets. Birmingham, Ala., is another city looking at this approach.

Easy-to-use computers and inexpensive software make it possible for the police
to create detailed daily maps showing when and where crime is occurring.
Precinct commanders and their superiors can then deploy more officers to those
areas. A rise in crime on a given street, which would be hidden under aggregate
statistics, is made plainly visible almost instantly. This transparency makes it
easier to hold commanders accountable.

In New Orleans, Mr. Maple's maps made clear that officers had to be stationed at
housing projects, where a huge proportion of the city's crime was committed.
Since making that change, violent crime in New Orleans is down 22 percent from
last year. Computer mapping is one reason Newark, which recently hired Mr.
Maple, has reduced its crime rate by 13 percent from last year.

Hot-spot mapping is not the sole reason for safer streets in New York. Cracking
down on low-level offenders, a shift in drug-trafficking patterns and stricter
sentencing also have helped. Some criminologists fear that a high-accountability
regime, marked by computer mapping, can create pressures that demoralize a
police force. Another potential problem is that precinct supervisors may be
tempted to underreport crimes. Those are serious concerns that require strong
management. New York's record suggests that the hot-spot strategy can increase
police accountability for positive results. Experience elsewhere appears to show
that this approach can be successfully exported.

Slower Growth in Number of Prisoners

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD

SECTION: Section A; Page 10; Column 4; National Desk

LENGTH: 981 words


The rapid growth in the number of people in the nation's jails and prisons
slowed last year for the first time in a decade, according to a study released
yesterday by the Justice Department, reflecting at least in part a decline in
the crime rate over the past five years.

At the end of June 1996, there were 1,630,940 people in Federal and state
prisons and local jails, an increase of 4.4 percent over the previous year,
compared with an average annual growth rate of 7.8 percent in the last decade,
the study found.

The growth rate slowed most noticeably in city and county jails, rising only 2.3
percent last year after increasing by an average of 6.9 percent over the
previous decade. Inmates sentenced to jail usually serve a term of a year or
less.

The slowing in the overall growth rate "is good news; it could be an early
reflection in the incarceration rate of the drop in crime over the last five
years," said Alfred Blumstein, a professor of criminology at Carnegie-Mellon
University.

But Professor Blumstein and some other experts tempered their enthusiasm, noting
that a slower growth rate in one year could be a random fluctuation. It will
take a few years to confirm whether this is a real trend, he said, noting that
the slowdown was not dramatic and that the incarceration rate grew last year
despite the five-year drop in the crime rate.

In fact, Franklin Zimring, the director of the Earl Warren Legal Institute of
the University of California at Berkeley, suggested that because the
incarceration rate has continued to increase even as crime has fallen, the
number of people in prison "tells us more about our feelings about crime and
criminals" and about changes in sentencing laws than about the the actual crime
rate.

The total number of people in jails and prisons doubled over the last decade and
tripled over the last 20 years as politicians pushed for tougher sentencing laws
and for building more prisons in response to mounting public fears about violent
crime. The national incarceration rate was 615 inmates per 100,000 Americans
last year, up from 313 per 100,000 in 1985.

One reason it is difficult to calculate precisely why the incarceration rate
goes up or down is that there is enormous variation in prison populations among
states and regions. The new study found, for example, that the District of
Columbia had the highest number of prisoners per capita, 1,444 per 100,000
residents, followed by Texas with 659, Louisiana with 611 and Oklahoma with 580.
But states in the northern Midwest and northern New England tend to have much
lower rates. North Dakota had 90 per 100,000, followed by Minnesota with 108 and
Maine with 112.

The South had the highest imprisonment rate with an average of 487 prisoners per
100,000 people, and the Northeast had the lowest, with 306.

An important factor in explaining why the prison population has continued to
grow, while the crime rate began to decline in 1992, experts say, is that the
crime which has led to the largest increase in incarceration, the sale and
possession of drugs, is not counted in the F.B.I.'s crime index. Over the last
10 years, Professor Blumstein estimated, drug offenders accounted for about half
the growth in the prison population.

The crime index tracks four violent crimes (murder, aggravated assault, robbery
and rape) and four property crimes (burglary, auto theft, arson and larceny, or
minor thefts like like shoplifting). Murder has dropped the fastest of the
crimes included in the index, though the murders make up only a very small part
of the total number of crimes.

Another reason the number of prison inmates has continued to increase, despite
the decline in serious and violent crimes, is that it often takes a year or
longer for offenders to be tried and sentenced to prison.

It is unclear whether the slower growth in the prison population could be
interpreted as a sign that tougher sentencing laws are successful. While experts
agree that building more prisons may reduce crime by removing some career
criminals from the streets, they have long argued about whether the threat of
harsher sentences deters criminals.

Professor Zimring said he was skeptical about a deterrent effect because the
prison population has tripled in 20 years while the crime rate has oscillated in
a slim range.

But Steven Levitt, an economist at Harvard University who studies the
effectiveness of prisons and police, said, "The underlying amount of crime would
have grown faster had we not locked so many people up."

To measure the effectiveness of imprisonment in reducing crimes, Professor
Levitt has studied the results of successful prisoner lawsuits to reduce
overcrowding.

In 12 states where such suits resulted in a judge's decision to reduce
overcrowding, he said, the growth rate of those states' prison population was 12
percent slower than that of the nation over the next three years, while the
violent crime rate in those states exceeded the national average by about 10
percent. Similarly, the property crime rate in those 12 states surpassed the
national average by about 6 percent in the three years after the lawsuits.

Although Professor Levitt acknowledged that using prisons to fight crime was
costly in both human and dollar terms, he said the new figures showing slower
growth in the incarceration rate "are a very clear indication" of the nationwide
drop in crime since 1992. "I would not be surprised over the next five years to
see more falling crime rates accompanied by continuing small increases in the
prison population," he said.

"It is conceivable that we have gotten over the hump, or cleared the peak of the
fight against crime," Professor Levitt said.

The new report released yesterday was written by Darrell Gilliard and Allen J.
Beck of the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the statistical arm of the Justice
Department.

The crime rate in four suburban counties - Hudson, N.J., Westchester, N.Y.,
Nassau, L.I. and Fairfield. Conn. - in the New York region a year ago dropped to
its lowest level in four years, according to the F.B.I.'s index crime
statistics. The decline largely reflected a continuing decrease in property
crimes like burglary and larceny. Violent crimes like murder, robbery and
aggravated assault are roughly what they were five years ago. The suburban
figures show a pattern similar to New York City's: Reported crimes moved to
record heights in 1989 or 1990, then fell off slightly in the last two years

CORRECTION:

The Pulse chart in the Metro Section yesterday about suburban crime misstated
the rate of motor vehicle theft in Fairfield County, Conn. The correct rates
were 807 per 100,000 residents in 1988, 1,018 in 1989, 1,067 in 1990, 1,166.3 in
1991 and 976.6 in 1992. Those figures exceeded the rates in Westchester County,
N.Y., and Nassau County, L.I., but were lower than those in Hudson County, N.J.,
and New York City.

ASIA CRIME GROUP HELD ACTIVE IN U.S.

BYLINE: By SELWYN RAAB

SECTION: Section A; Page 1, Column 1; National Desk

LENGTH: 818 words


Attorney General William French Smith said yesterday that while the Federal
Government had achieved ''its greatest successes ever'' against traditional
organized-crime groups, ''new crime cartels'' from Asia were spreading to the
United States.

Mr. Smith was the first witness to testify as the President's Commission on
Organized Crime opened three days of hearings that will focus principally on
Chinese and Japanese crime groups that the commission said had emerged in New
York and other major cities.

The commission heard testimony from six law enforcement agents and from two
disguised undercover witnesses - dressed in monklike hoods and robes - about the
activities of new Chinese factions in the United States and Canada that have
apparent links to long-established criminal groups in Hong Kong and Taiwan.

The agents testified about secret Chinese organizations known as triads, which
they said compelled new members to drink human and chicken blood at initiation
rites and to swear loyalty oaths to their leaders. Disloyal members are punished
by being crippled or are assassinated, the agents said.

In the domed, marble-columned Federal Hall in lower Manhattan, the witnesses
also told of investigations that had uncovered evidence apparently connecting
triad leaders in Hong Kong to tongs, or Chinese fraternal organizations that
have long existed in America, and to street gangs in New York City, Boston,
Chicago, San Francisco, Oakland, Calif., and Toronto.

''In my judgment, we may be witnessing nothing less than the beginning of the
end of the traditional organized crime that has plagued our nation for so many
decades,'' Mr. Smith said, referring to the organizations known as La Cosa
Nostra and the Mafia.

''During my four years as Attorney General,'' he said, ''I have been continually
impressed with the degree to which organized crime has entered a new historical
phase - its international phase. This development is directly related to drug
trafficking, a very lucrative enterprise.''

Federal Judge Irving R. Kaufman said the hearings would reveal that Chinese and
Japanese criminal organizations in America ''have developed ties with
traditional organized crime'' and that ''law enforcement authorities are seeing
increased evidence of such cooperation and coordination.''

An Executive Order


The 19-member commission was established by President Reagan through an
executive order on July 28, 1983. It has a mandate to analyze organized- crime
activities in the country and to recommend proposals for dealing with such
problems.

Mr. Kaufman, who is a judge in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit, said the commission would soon issue its first report that would
describe how organized crime launders - or legitimizes - money obtained through
illegal activities.

According to Judge Kaufman, the Asian groups control the importing of heroin
from Southeast Asia's Golden Triangle - Thailand, Burma and Laos. The triads,
through their relationships with American tongs and street gangs, are
responsible for about 20 percent of the heroin now smuggled into the country,
James D. Harmon Jr., the commission's chief counsel, estimated.

Besides trafficking in heroin and cocaine, witnesses said, the Chinese crime
groups are involved in extortion, gambling, robberies and prostitution.

'Virtually Unnoticed'


Judge Kaufman said many of the Asian groups had been operating ''virtually
unnoticed'' by the public. ''We can not ignore this threat on American life,''
he added.

Two witnesses, David Williams, a commission investigator, and John T. Feehan, a
special agent of the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration, identified the
leader of the Chinese crime group in New York as T. C. (Eddie) Chan.

The agents and Mr. Harmon said Mr. Chan was a former police sergeant in Hong
Kong and, after emigrating to New York in 1975, had operated several
restaurants. Mr. Chan was said by the agents to have been the former head of the
On Leong tong, one of the most important civic groups in Chinatown.

Contempt Proceedings


Mr. Harmon said that Mr. Chan had ignored a subpoena to testify and that
contempt of court proceedings against him would be started.

Two witnesses who were not identified were disguised in hoods and robes and
testified behind a screen, with their voices distorted through a special audio
scrambler. Mr. Harmon said the security measures were necessary because staff
investigators spotted Chinese gang members on the street outside the hearing
room.

One of the unidentified witnesses, whose comments indicated that he had been a
member of a New York gang, the Ghost Shadows, said that the group had obtained
guns from ''the Mafia'' and that about 100 of its 200 members were Vietnamese
refugees.

The hearing will resume today at 10 A.M. in Federal Hall at 26 Wall Street.

Crime in perspective

LENGTH: 567 words


No level of crime higher than zero is acceptable, of course, but FBI data
released this week for crimes committed in 2012 helps put things in perspective.
Utah remains one of the safest places in the United States, and crime nationwide
is not a growing problem. That may come as a surprise to some. This isn't to say
all is well.

Despite low crime rates statewide, Salt Lake City saw a 12 percent rise in
property crimes, including a 15 percent increase in auto thefts. Even when the
capital city's figures are included, however, such crimes decreased statewide.
Nationally, violent crimes rose 0.7 percent, while property crimes declined by
about as much. The figures paint a different picture than the one portrayed by
well-publicized random mass killings, such as the one last week at the U.S. Navy
Yard in Washington, D.C. Those crimes, heinous though they are, represent a
rare, unique and vexing sort of problem, the causes of which are difficult to
assess or prevent. The chances of becoming a victim of such a crime are tiny,
and the rate of such crimes has remained fairly steady for decades. The irony is
that while those tragedies generate talk among politicians about stricter gun
controls, existing laws have not prevented crime rates from dropping to near
record low levels in parts of the country that used to be danger zones. In Los
Angeles, for instance, violent crime is at a level not seen since the mid-1950s,
according to a statement Police Chief Charlie Beck made to the Daily News.
Despite the bombing at the marathon finish line in Boston on Patriots Day this
year (a crime not counted in these figures but that wouldn't change the overall
rate much), that city's crime rate also is little changed after decades of
steady decline. Americans should be grateful for these figures. If states had to
deal with rising crime rates at a time of economic distress, that would further
burden already stressed state budgets. Why is the rate of crime so relatively
low? That question is almost as difficult to answer as why people commit crimes.
Demographics may have something to do with it. The nation is aging, and young
people tend to be more disposed to committing crimes. Incarceration rates remain
high, as well. Some people credit aggressive policing tactics. The answer may
lie in bits and pieces of all of the above. All is not well in every part of the
nation. The cities of Detroit and Flint, Mich., have unusually high murder
rates, and Chicago's murder rate rose precipitously. But that leads us to the
other perspective brought about by the FBI figures. Crime is a local problem.
There is little people in Utah can do to help folks in Michigan make
neighborhoods safer, but there is much people can do to help their own
neighborhoods. Salt Lake City police spokeswoman Lara Jones told KSL.com that
Utahns "tend to look out for each other." "When something happens in a
neighborhood, people get outraged," she said. That sense of community is an
important ingredient for making homes and families safe. Neighbors must look out
for each other. Neighborhood watch programs, properly and safely administered,
help people remain vigilant. Salt Lake City must find a way to keep its crime
levels under control. All Utahns have an interest in keeping their capital and
flagship city safe. But Utah's overall rank as the sixth safest state, despite a
healthy growth rate, is good news.

City ranks high in FBI crime index ratings

Despite the routine finger-pointing toward the East and West Coasts in terms of
who has the worst crime rates, middle America needs to take a look in the
mirror.

According to the new Federal Bureau of Investigation's Uniform Crime Reports,
the national crime index rate for 2002 was 4,118, which reflects the total
number of offenses per 100,000 residents.

The report identifies U.S. cities with the highest and lowest rates of crime
during 2002.

While the Northeast sailed through with the lowest index rate of the four
regions at 2,889 offenses per 100,000 residents, the South reigned with the
highest at 4,722 offenses.

The top-10 cities with the worst crime rates - starting with the worst - were
Tuscon, Ariz.; Memphis, Tenn.; Miami; Phoenix-Mesa; Little Rock-North Little
Rock, Ark.; San Antonio; Baton Rouge, La.; Stockton-Lodi, Calif.; Oklahoma City
and Honolulu.

According to the study, per 100,000 residents, Oklahoma's crime index is 6,467.
Tulsa's was 5,133.5 offenses.

The breakdown for Oklahoma City includes murder, 4.6; rape, 59.8; robbery,
128.9; assault, 350; burglary, 1,222.2; larceny, 4,245; auto theft, 456.

The top-10 cities with the least crime - starting with the best - are
Nassau-Suffolk, N.Y.; Middlesex-Somerset-Hunterdon, N.J.; Ventura, Calif.;
Monmouth-Ocean, N.J.; Bergen-Passaic, N.J.; Scranton-Wilkes-Barre-Hazleton,
Penn.; Harrisburg-Lebanon-Carlisle, Penn.; San Jose, Calif.; Pittsburgh and
Orange County, Calif.

The FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting Program Crime Index used for the study
consists of the combined rate of murder and non-negligent manslaughter, forcible
rape, robbery, assault, burglary, larceny and auto theft per 100,000 population.
This study considered 331 U.S. metropolitan statistical areas. The data was
taken from the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting Program report for 2002.

Drugs, poverty cited in rise in criminal activity

BYLINE: Sam Vincent Meddis

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 11A

LENGTH: 630 words


The crime rate in the USA continues to rise, despite an unprecedented crackdown
by law enforcers.

An FBI report released Sunday shows violent crime up 10% in 1990, and crime
overall up 1%.

Barry Krisberg, director of the National Council on Crime and Delinquency, says
part of the problem is that children of the baby-boom generation are growing up.

In addition, he says more children are growing up in poverty at a time when the
safety net of the child welfare system has deteriorated.

Darrel Stephens of the Police Executive Research Forum says crime in the USA
also is ''being driven by the problem of drug abuse.''

He says addicts rob for money to buy drugs, while turf battles among traffickers
and drug deals that go sour result in killings and assaults.

The nationwide crackdown on drug abuse also may be swamping law enforcers'
abilities to deal with other crimes, says Eric Sterling of the Washington- based
Criminal Justice Policy Foundation.

The new FBI statistics follow two other government reports last week that show
the U.S. jail population hit a record 400,000 inmates in 1989 - a 77% increase
since 1983. About 40% of the growth resulted from increases in the number of
people held for or convicted of drug charges.

''Our hospitals are in crisis, our jails are in crisis, our courts are in
crisis,'' says Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., chairman of a House narcotics
committee.

A Justice Department crime victim report in March, based on a random survey,
found a 4% drop in personal crimes such as rape, robbery and assault. But it did
not include homicide, violence against children under 12 or commercial crime.

Clinton Backs Expanding Definition of a Hate Crime

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET

SECTION: Section A; Page 20; Column 1; National Desk

LENGTH: 586 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 10


Uncertain of the scope of the problem or how best to address it, President
Clinton convened a White House Conference on Hate Crimes here today, saying that
such acts "strike at the heart of what it means to be an American."

In an address starting the daylong conference, Mr. Clinton endorsed forthcoming
legislation that would add crimes committed against people because they are gay,
lesbian, female or disabled to the list of Federal hate crimes.

Federal hate crimes now include crimes committed against people because of their
race, religion, color or national origin. The new legislation, sponsored by
Senators Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Arlen Specter,
Republican of Pennsylvania, would also eliminate a requirement that the crime
occur while the victim is engaged in a "federally protected" activity --
enrolling in school, for example.

Mr. Clinton also announced a package of modest Federal initiatives to combat
hate crimes. And he took advantage of the setting -- an auditorium at George
Washington University crowded with civil rights advocates, educators, law
enforcers and victims of hate crimes -- to restate his support for Bill Lann
Lee, his contested nominee for assistant attorney general for civil rights.

Mr. Clinton said that members of the Senate Judiciary Committee were blocking
the nomination of Mr. Lee "because he supports his own President's position on
affirmative action."

"All I ask the Senate committee to do is just to send his name out," he said.
"They don't even have to make a recommendation; just let the Senate vote." On
Sunday, Senator Orrin G. Hatch, the Utah Republican who is chairman of the
committee, called the nomination "dead."

In 1996, there were 8,759 hate crimes reported to the Justice Department, up
from 7,947 in 1995. But since jurisdictions define hate crimes differently and
reporting is voluntary, White House officials cautioned that those numbers were
unreliable. They said that there were no statistics to indicate whether
organized hate groups, like the Ku Klux Klan, were on the rise or dissipating.

The decision to hold today's conference grew out of preparations for Mr.
Clinton's yearlong initiative to improve race relations.

Mr. Clinton participated in an hourlong workshop this afternoon, listening as a
California legislator, a New York educator, a Seattle student and others talked
about grappling with hate crimes and discrimination. He appealed to them for
advice, receiving in return mostly praise for steps he had already taken in
underscoring the problem.

Arturo Venegas Jr., chief of the Sacramento Police Department, warned that there
was "no magic bullet" to end hate crimes.

While several participants emphasized that schools could teach children the
dangers of prejudice, Tammie Schnitzer, who as a private citizen in Billings,
Mont., rallied her city against a rash of anti-Semitic crimes four years ago,
said education was not sufficient.

"This problem is far deeper," Ms. Schnitzer said. "I have to teach my
grandparents before I teach my kids."

Mr. Clinton announced today that all United States attorneys would "establish or
expand working groups" to focus on combatting hate crimes. He said the Justice
Department would assign at least 50 more Federal Bureau of Investigation agents
and prosecutors to enforce the hate crimes laws. And he said the Department of
Housing and Urban Development would provide for stiffer fines against people who
discriminate in housing.

Lewis & Clark crime victim institute builds clinics nationally

BYLINE: The Daily Journal of Commerce

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 347 words


The National Crime Victim Law Institute at Lewis & Clark Law School has received
$775,000 to create five new crime victim rights clinics around the country. The
grant was awarded by the Office for Victims of Crime in the Office of Justice
Programs for the U.S. Department of Justice.

The clinics will provide free legal representation to crime victims in
Sacramento, Calif.; Upper Marlboro, Md.; St. Louis, Mo.; Albuquerque, N.M.; and
Columbia, S.C. A clinic already established in Tempe, Ariz., will continue to
receive funding. Currently, all states have statutes guaranteeing victims of
crime specific rights during the criminal justice process, and 33 states have
state constitutional amendments guaranteeing these rights. According to the
institute's executive director Doug Beloof, these rights are not actively
enforced, which can lead to further victimization for crime victims during
criminal proceedings.

"These clinics are designed to ensure that victims of crime have independent,
pro bono, legal representation throughout the criminal justice process," said
Beloof.

The locations were chosen because the applicant organizations demonstrated
dedication to victims' issues, their state laws provide strong rights for crime
victims, and the clinics present a geographic distribution that will help
victims nationally, according to Beloof.

The Victims' Legal Assistance Project, a collaboration between Arizona Voice for
Crime Victims and the Arizona State University College of Law, was the first
state law clinic to provide legal assistance to crime victims. The grant to the
institute will continue funding the Victims' Legal Assistance Project and will
allow its model to be replicated in other states.

The National Crime Victim Law Institute, established at Lewis & Clark Law School
in 2000, is a nonprofit research and educational organization whose staff
members assist attorneys in providing direct legal services, file amicus briefs
to advocate for victims, conduct research, and provide information on issues
concerning victims' legal rights.

Computer can predict when, where crimes will occur: Model can forecast type,
number of offences within 10-block area

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH

PITTSBURGH -- More than a decade of extensive crime data collection matched with
new technology may soon allow police to predict, to a surprising degree of
accuracy, the number and type of crimes that will occur in a given neighbourhood
one month in advance.

Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University plan to release software later this
summer that, according to computer models, can forecast the number and types of
crimes that will occur within a 10-block area, with a 20-per-cent error rate.

"This is the next generation of crime mapping," said Wilpen Gorr, a Carnegie
Mellon professor of public policy and management information systems.

While the computer model seems to be an eerie precursor to the futuristic world
Steven Spielberg created in his film Minority Report last year, Mr. Gorr points
out that the program will not be able to predict exact crimes. In the film
starring Tom Cruise, police officers can predict crimes before they happen --
and then arrest the offenders before they offend. Mr. Gorr's computer model will
predict the frequency and type of crimes, and their general location.

To do that, researchers used crime data from Pittsburgh and Rochester, New York,
collected between 1990 and 2001. With models similar to those used in
macroeconomics to warn of recession or inflation, Mr. Gorr said researchers
matched criminal reports, 911 calls on shots fired, and census data, along with
a mishmash of yellow page listings and seasonal variations, to predict crime
numbers.

The ethnic makeup of neighbourhoods was not considered, however, poverty levels
and the number of single-mother households were used.

After running 36,000 separate forecasts for the month ahead based on a decade's
worth of crime data, researchers successfully predicted how many burglaries,
arsons, aggravated assaults, car thefts and other crimes would take place in the
next month in a 10-block area, Mr. Gorr said.

"It's surprising that it worked at all and the 20-per-cent error area was
impressive," Mr. Gorr said. The new system also forecast crimes that would not
likely have been anticipated using traditional crime mapping, he said.

"I think more impressive is that 30 to 40 per cent of the crimes committed could
be seen as a real big surprise, something you would not have expected in that
area at that time."

Homicide and some other major crimes were not included because they are scarce,
relative to offences such as larceny, Mr. Gorr said.

USA TODAY/CNN/Gallup POLL / Expats fear crime back in the USA

Many U.S. citizens are victims of crime while living overseas, yet many still
perceive the USA as a more violent place than their host country.

"Crime actually is one of the main reasons I'm afraid to go home to America,"
says Joan Hoffsten, 39, a Buffalo, N.Y., native. She has been abroad for six
years and currently lives in Linkoping, Sweden, with her Swedish husband and
three-month-old daughter.

"It's safe here," says Hong Kong resident Barbara Ross, 28, from New York City.
"Whenever I go home (to the USA), I'm holding onto everything."

Of the nearly 900 people who responded to a recent USA TODAY International
write-in survey, 27% said they had been the victim of a non-violent crime - such
as theft - since moving abroad.

Three percent said they had experienced violent crime while overseas. The
average length of time respondents had lived abroad was four years.

"You have much greater concerns for your family living in the States than here
in Norway," says Mark Shahly, 38, who moved to Harfsfjord from Houston 18 months
ago. "The kids can wander around anywhere they want to at night without risk of
being shot or dragged off someplace."

He says Norwegians perceive the USA as being more violent than it really is but
concedes that when he visits the USA, "I'm a bit more fearful now, particularly
in the big cities."

As the City Grows Safer, Crime Loosens Its Grip on the News

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

SECTION: Section 1; Page 35; Column 2; Metropolitan Desk; Second Front

LENGTH: 1780 words


It was a slow news day in the depths of summer. Thirteen Ohio factory workers
had won a $296 million lottery. The Hamptons were gearing up for a visit by the
Clintons.

WCBS-TV, Channel 2 in New York City, chose a different bit of news to lead its 6
P.M. newscast on July 30: seven women had been harassed over the previous two
months on a jogging path in Westchester. Once, a man fondled himself as a woman
passed by. Several other times, someone tried without success to grab one of the
women, the station reported.

Since no one had been hurt or arrested (the police were not even sure if they
had one or several suspects), the incidents might seem an odd choice as the top
news in the nation's largest city. In the early 1990's, when the New York crime
rate was much higher, the report would have been unlikely to make the broadcast,
much less lead it.

The selection reflects some of the significant changes on New York's television
news broadcasts and in its newspapers as the city's crime rate has dropped for
the last half-dozen years. The crime stories reported by the local news
organizations these days are noticeably different, having a greater emphasis on
sexual attacks and child abuse. There are more reports on crimes in the suburbs
and the outer reaches of the region, as well as stepped-up coverage of the inner
workings of the Police Department itself, including police misconduct.

But it is in the sheer numbers of reports about crime -- particularly in New
York City's three major daily newspapers -- where change is most pronounced. In
the first two weeks of May 1994, for example, there were 120 articles on crimes
in the city in The Daily News, The New York Post and The New York Times. In the
first two weeks of May this year, there were only a third as many articles about
crime in the three newspapers: 44 altogether, including several on crimes in the
suburbs. On many days in May, there was no crime news at all in The Daily News
or The Post, where once it was a staple.

On local television news, which has been criticized for years for its daily diet
of murder and mayhem, there appears to be a reduction as well, though much more
modest. It is impossible to quantify, because news directors at New York's major
network-owned stations refused to make available videotapes or written records
of old broadcasts.

There is no rigorous independent survey that analyzed the contents of local news
four or more years ago. But many current and former television news executives
say that for many years at least 30 percent to 40 percent of the reports on
local newscasts were about crime. The New York Times analyzed 20 news broadcasts
on the three network-owned stations with the largest audiences -- WCBS-TV,
WNBC-TV and WABC-TV -- over four weeks this summer, and crime was the subject of
27 percent of the reports.

On some evenings, reports about crime represented a majority of the reports on
local news programs, and many minutes of air time at the start of the broadcasts
were devoted to them. But on other nights, crime news was relatively brief and
came late in the programs.

These changes are largely a consequence of the remarkable decline of violent
crime in New York, where the number of killings has diminished from 2,245 in
1990 to 767 last year. At the current rate, there would be fewer than 600 this
year, the lowest total in three decades.

Alterations in news coverage also reflect deliberate decisions, especially by
people who manage local television news operations, to adjust somewhat the tone
and content of their daily reports. "There is a positive feeling overall, and I
think reporters and editors come into the workplace feeling that, because we all
live in the same community," said Bill Carey, news director of WCBS-TV. "We look
for stories that are relevant to the life that we live."

Many reporters and editors say the changes are also the result of Police
Department policies that make it more difficult to get information on crime and
access to police officials.

Six or seven years ago, when there were nearly six killings a day in New York
City, on average, the basic question for crime reporters was which of the grisly
homicides to cover. There was seldom time to report on other kinds of crime or
on the Police Department as an institution. Crime news often crowded out other
subjects on television like politics or education.

"Today, there is less and less crime that is worthy of any coverage," said Bart
Feder, news director at Channel 7, WABC-TV. "This is an opportunity to fill the
shows in a more interesting and diverse way. I think there is more commitment at
all the stations to enterprise reporting, to investigative reporting, to
honest-to-goodness journalism."

Mr. Feder's counterparts at other New York City stations offer the same
assessment, and on some nights there is evidence to buttress their view. But
careful viewing of the 6 P.M. and 11 P.M. news programs also offered
considerable evidence to the contrary.

Some nights, stations compensate for the city murder gap by covering crimes
committed in other places and by reporting on local crimes that, not long ago,
would have passed unnoticed.

A few weeks ago, for example, Channel 7 sent a reporter to Westchester for a
long piece on the expanded use of unmarked police cars on highways to counter
road rage. Local stations also reported in recent weeks on the arrest of a man
in Freehold, N.J., accused of stabbing his wife; a sexual assault on an employee
of a Bronx motel, and a double homicide in Bayonne, N.J.

But there were also recent examples of more ambitious journalism on local
stations, reports on serious subjects that might have had difficulty getting on
the air when television news was overwhelmed by body bags.

On Aug. 28, Channel 4 broadcast a long report on how the stock market's slide
might affect New York City's budget. The previous week, a Channel 4 reporter
assessed the accuracy of campaign advertisements by Democratic candidates for
governor and the United States Senate.

Many journalism professors and critics contend there is still too much crime on
local television. "There's no question that it is still the predominant item,"
said David Klatell, head of the broadcast program at Columbia University's
Graduate School of Journalism. "Television news has always been a much more
emotive and emotional medium than a logical one, and so the fear of crime
persists even if the reality doesn't. It's much easier to cover crime than to
cover the school system or race relations."

Mr. Klatell worked with a group of academic researchers who began to study the
content of local television news two years ago. They analyzed broadcasts in
eight cities on four nights during the 1996-97 television season. The survey
showed that 27.2 percent of the air time on New York City newscasts was devoted
to crime, well above the eight-city average of 20.2 percent. A similar analysis
of the television season that ended last spring is not finished.

Some former broadcast executives credit NY1 News, the all-news cable station,
with influencing coverage on the larger network-owned stations. Since it started
in 1992, NY1 has tried to balance crime news with beat reporting on everything
from government and schools to the subway and neighborhoods.

Steve Paulus, the senior vice president for news at NY1, said that his station
was devoting less time to crime these days. "Where a police reporter would have
covered the crime of the day," he said, "the police reporter is now more likely
to be covering Police Department issues."

Paradoxically, the reduced crime rate may sometimes cause journalists to react
more strongly to major crimes. The decline in crime means that "those that do
occur take on a prominence, seem more newsworthy than they did in the past,"
said Arthur Browne, the managing editor of The Daily News. "There is an added
shock value now when they happen."

Many reporters who regularly cover the police say that another factor in the
decline of crime news is that the police share information less readily and are
generally less cooperative. Some police reporters said that they could usually
get enough information to report breaking crime news, but that it was often
difficult if not impossible to learn enough for analytic or other enterprise
pieces.

"This administration has made a concerted drive to keep bad news out of the
papers and off the screen," said Gabe Pressman, the veteran television reporter
who is president of the New York Press Club.

Whether it is by design or by chance, the decrease of crime news in the city's
papers is startling. On May 4, for example, there was a single crime article in
The Daily News, buried deep on page 24: a 13-year-old Long Island boy had been
shot in the shoulder by a stray bullet, possibly from a nearby shooting range.
The Times, in its local pages, had one reference to crime: a few sentences on a
sexual abuse case in Syracuse. The following day, there were no reports on crime
in The News, The Times or The Post.
 On May 6, there was one article in The Post, on page 7, about the arrest of a
substitute teacher in Queens accused of hitting students with a chair. The News
put the same report on page 8, next to an article about an investigation into
whether police officers had covered up for an off-duty detective involved in a
car crash. The Times carried an article on the substitute teacher on page B1.

That week, and the following one, the front pages of New York's tabloids --
where crime once was king -- were taken up with the Knicks' playoff chances, new
cancer drugs and the final episode of "Seinfeld."

"There are really two possible explanations for this," said Mitchell Stephens,
acting chairman of the journalism department at New York University. "One is
that the reality has changed and news reflects reality. I tend to doubt that.
The other is that competitive organizational pressures in the news business are
responsible for the waxing and waning of crime coverage."

Mr. Stephens, who has a new book on video and television called "The Rise of the
Image the Fall of the Word," said the arrival of New York Newsday in the 1980's
led to a brutal circulation war in the city. In time-honored American fashion,
he said, newspapers sought circulation by concentrating on crime. The death of
New York Newsday eased the circulation wars, he said, reducing pressure on
editors to pursue crime.

Mr. Stephens also offered a second theory for the diminished attention to crime
by the New York news organizations. "Maybe people are feeling less paranoid," he
said, "and it is harder to push those buttons."

Camden crime rate is second-highest, national study says

BYLINE: By Kristen A. Graham; Inquirer Staff Writer

LENGTH: 429 words


Camden had the second-highest crime rate in the United States last year,
according to an annual study released Sunday by CQ Press.

Though the ranking isn't good news, it's an improvement for Camden, which in
2008 had the highest crime rate in the country. This year, St. Louis won that
dubious distinction, followed by Camden, Detroit, Flint, Mich., and Oakland.

Philadelphia was ranked 30th among 400 cities. Among the cities with population
of more than 500,000, Philadelphia had the seventh-highest crime rate, behind
Detroit, Baltimore, Memphis, Washington, Atlanta, and Indianapolis.

The 10 big cities with the lowest crime rates included New York City, Los
Angeles, San Diego, and Seattle.

The crime rate was calculated using 2009 data for six categories: murder, rape,
robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, and motor-vehicle theft. The cities
ranked must have a population of at least 75,000.

Camden, with a population of about 79,000, was named the most violent city in
the United States by the CQ Press in 2004 and 2005. In 2006 and 2007, it was
ranked fifth.

There have been 33 homicides this year in Camden.

The study has been criticized as simplistic by some law enforcement officials.
Its rankings compare incidences of crime by population, but do not figure in
other factors.

Camden Mayor Dana Redd blasted the survey in a statement released Sunday and
called for residents to "denounce the CQ report."

"It is unfortunate that this flawed report continues to be published for the
sake of making a buck," Redd said. "In fact, our latest data shows that overall
crime is at a 40-year low in Camden."

Redd invited outsiders to "come see the revitalization effort taking place in
Camden."

Redd and Police Chief Scott Thomson said that year-to-date crime has dropped 9
percent. The year-to-date homicide and manslaughter rate is down 33 percent,
officials said.

Camden, however, faces potentially huge budget cuts and may have to lay off
police officers next fiscal year.

Jason Laughlin, spokesman for Camden County Prosecutor Warren Faulk, said that
because the survey is based on 2009 crime numbers, officials had expected Camden
to rank high in the survey.

"You can argue with the methodology of the survey, but the city has a lot of
problems," Laughlin said.

Laughlin said that his office is targeting violent crime in Camden. A task force
will examine all homicides and nonfatal shootings in an attempt to improve the
rate of those crimes which are solved and the rate at which convictions are won.

Durham ranks low in violent crime;
Comparison places city, county below similar-sized areas

DURHAM -- When compared to similar cities, Durham comes in at the low end of the
spectrum when it comes to violent crimes, according to the 2007 Crime
Comparative by the Durham Convention and Visitors Bureau.

When compared to 10 other Southeast communities with similar populations and
socioeconomic makeup, the city of Durham ranks seventh for total number of
violent crimes per 100,000 residents and the county ranks ninth. The three
communities that had fewer violent crimes than the city of Durham in the
comparison were Winston-Salem, Savannah, Ga., and Raleigh. Of the 11 communities
used in the comparison, Chattanooga, Tenn., had the most violent crimes per
100,000 residents.

Among North Carolina cities, Greensboro ranked No. 3, Winston No. 8 and Raleigh
No. 11.

For property crimes, Durham city ranked sixth among the 11 southeast
communities. Durham city and county ranked ninth. Chattanooga again topped the
list with the most crimes and Raleigh had the fewest property crimes.

The comparison also offers a broader national scope, comparing Durham to 29
other communities across the country. For violent crimes per 100,000 residents,
Durham city ranked 22, and Durham city and county came in at No. 26.

Local officials said they aren't surprised Durham was one of the lower-crime
cities.

"Durham has always been at or below the average," said Reyn Bowman, bureau
president and CEO.

He added that the reason Durham seems to have the perception of being more crime
-riddled than it actually is, is because of media coverage.

"Durham is the only city in the state that is covered by two major dailies. That
results in twice the coverage, the headlines popping up on the Internet show
twice the crime when it's really twice the coverage," Bowman said.

Chief Deputy Wes Crabtree at the Durham County Sheriff's Office agreed.

"Comparisons are never a perfect meter and the way crime is reported in Durham
has a direct impact on how people think of it," he said. "There is a lot of
crime and there is a lot of stuff that needs to be taken care of, but is it any
worse than anywhere else, I don't think so."

But the heightened perception of crime in Durham may not be a bad thing.

"I think it's the case that Durham has the image that Durham is more dangerous,
so there are higher rates of guardianship," said Ken Land, professor of
demographic studies and sociology at Duke University.

VIOLENT CRIMES FEW IN AUGUSTA

BYLINE: By Jeremy Craig Staff Writer

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B01

LENGTH: 328 words


If you live in metro Augusta, you might have a good chance of getting your house
broken into or your property stolen.

But your chances of getting hurt or killed in a crime are lower than in most
areas of Georgia, and significantly lower than in most of South Carolina, new
FBI data show.

In 2005, there were 392 violent crimes per 100,000 people in the Augusta area,
the FBI said, and 4,519 property crimes per 100,000.

The national rates per 100,000 people in 2005 were 469 for violent crimes and
3,430 for property crimes.

The data were released in the FBI's annual report, Crime in the United States,
last week.

For reporting purposes, the FBI defines metro Augusta as Burke, Columbia,
Richmond and McDuffie counties in Georgia and Aiken and Edgefield counties in
South Carolina.

Even with a population of more than 4.8 million, metro Atlanta was not the most
violent place in Georgia, the FBI numbers say. It's Brunswick, with more than
700 violent crimes per 100,000 people in 2005.

In South Carolina, the Flor-ence area led in violent crime, as it has for the
past several years, with nearly 1,300 violent crimes per 100,000 people in 2005.

Comparing property crime rates, Myrtle Beach, S.C., and Macon, Ga., led metro
areas in each state, with more than 6,000 property crimes per 100,000 people in
each area.

The numbers come from the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting program, which has kept
track of national crime rates since the 1930s.

They're the numbers often cited by chambers of commerce, the media, tourism
organizations and other entities with an interest in crime.

Richmond County Sheriff Ronnie Strength said he doesn't look at the annual FBI
numbers.

"I quit looking at those years ago," he said.

The sheriff said he looks at the number of crimes reported by his own department
when comparing crime rates, because the sheriff's office breaks down crime into
narrower, more accurate categories.

Mayors sound alarm on crime / They'll map a plan of action for Clinton

BYLINE: Sam Vincent Meddis

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 494 words


Big-city mayors gather in Chicago today for an "emergency" meeting to help map a
national anti-crime plan for President Clinton.

"The feeling among mayors and police is focused these days more than ever before
on the epidemic of crime that's occurring around the country," says Louisville
Mayor Jerry Abramson, president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors.

The mayors' alarm over crime comes as the Justice Department reported Sunday
that overall crime fell 5% nationally last year.

Yet mayors' crime concerns are justified, law enforcement experts say, because
violent crime is becoming increasingly concentrated in urban areas.

"The level of crime has gone up dramatically over the past five years," says
Greensboro, N.C., Police Chief Sylvester Daughtry, president of the
International Association of Chiefs of Police. "And we see no signs that it's
decreasing."

Minorities, the poor and those living in cities felt the greatest brunt, says
Sunday's report by the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics:

For blacks, the 1992 violent crime rate was the highest recorded - nearly 15
robberies for every 1,000 blacks, compared with fewer than five for every 1,000
whites.

Residents of central cities were robbed at a rate more than three times that of
people living in non-metro areas.

Fear of crime knows no geographic boundaries. In a USA TODAY/CNN/Gallup Poll
last month, 90% said crime got worse in 1992.

Politicians' concerns are amplified by the public's anti-crime outrage in recent
elections, with candidates such as New York City Mayor-elect Rudolph Giuliani, a
former federal prosecutor, capitalizing on a law-and-order theme.

In the election wake, the U.S. Senate voted for a $ 22 billion anti-crime plan,
including money for 100,000 extra police officers - nearly double the money that
Clinton had sought.

Today's Chicago meeting will include mayors and police chiefs from nearly two
dozen of the nation's largest cities.

They want to exchange crime-fighting techniques - like the community policing
program in Kansas City, Mo.

There, Police Chief Stephen Bishop says homicides in housing projects were cut
50% by taking police out of cars and putting them on foot patrols.

Mayors say they also want to develop an "action plan" for the federal government
that goes beyond the crime bill and addresses root causes, such as poverty,
deteriorating housing and poor education and job training.

But some experts are skeptical about how much the federal government can
accomplish, unless community business leaders, health providers and education
officials also join in.

"If it were within the power of an individual, like a police chief, we would
have found a solution by now," says Hubert Williams of the Police Foundation, a
law enforcement research organization. "Getting resources is important - but not
the heart of the problem."

City's Crime Rate Falls to 12th in U.S.

Boston had the highest crime rate among the nation's 25 largest cities last
year, with 14,146 crimes for every 100,000 people, while New York dropped to
12th place, according to a list compiled by the New York City Police Department.

The list was based on preliminary figures reported this week by the Federal
Bureau of Investigation. There were seven categories of crime -homicide, rape,
robbery, assault, burglary, larceny and car theft.

New York City, whose rate was 10,265, was ninth last year. Boston was not ranked
then because its figures were not available, according to Sgt. William E. Gusa
of the New York City Police Department's crime analysis unit.

St. Louis, second this year, was first last year.  The cities and their 1981
rate of crimes were given as: Boston 14,145.5 St. Louis 13,828.5 Dallas 12,342.4

SBI REPORT / Police chief credits neighborhood watch programs; Crime dips, but
violence up

BYLINE: By MORGAN LEE, Staff writer

SECTION: Local/Regional; Pg. 1A

LENGTH: 513 words


A 3 percent drop in all crime in Wilmington last year is due to increased
vigilance by neighborhood watches, Police Chief John Cease said Monday.

A dip in burglary and larceny led the drop in the crime rate for the city,
according to a State Bureau of Investigation report on crimes statewide. In
overall crime, Wilmington fared better than several other medium-sized cities
and the state in the annual report.

But the report also had bad news for the area. Illegal drugs continue to fuel an
increase in violent crimes even as police average 150 drug arrests a month, the
chief said.

Wilmington had 28 more violent crimes in 1997 than 1996, a 4 percent increase.
About one in every 10 crimes was violent.

Preventive measures like neighborhood watches helped law enforcement nudge down
property crimes 4 percent, Chief Cease said. The decrease in crime is even more
pronounced considering Wilmington's population growth, he said.

"Crime is going to go up proportionally," said Chief Cease. "Even when we see a
plateau in the number, I'm encouraged by that."

The violent crime categories that showed an increase - murder and robbery - are
the most difficult to prevent, according to Chief Cease. "The chances of being
there as a police officer are very small," he said. "That doesn't mean that the
crime isn't important."

He said the number of aggravated assaults, the largest category of violent crime
in Wilmington, decreased 9 percent.

The majority of violent crime can be attributed to the drug trade, Chief Cease
said.

"That's why we need to have somebody kicking in with drug prevention and
treatment," he said.

Other medium-sized cities in the state saw the number of crimes increase.

In Greenville, crime increased 8 percent; in Rocky Mount, 9 percent; and in
Asheville, 10 percent.

Jacksonville had less crime overall - and less violent crime. And big cities
such as Charlotte-Mecklenburg and Winston-Salem also saw overall declines.

The overall crime rate in North Carolina declined by 1 percent in 1997 and the
murder rate dropped 5 percentage points, continuing a five-year trend, Attorney
General Mike Easley said.

The rate of violent crimes increased by 3 percent, fueled by a 5 percent
increase in the robbery rate, but property crimes decreased by 1 percent. From
1993 to 1997, the violent crime rate has decreased 11 percent and the murder
rate is down 29 percent.

Metro's Plan to Shift Patrols Questioned; Putting More Officers on Trains Could
Result in Rise in Auto Thefts, Officials Say

Alice Reid, Washington Post Staff Writer

SECTION: METRO; Pg. D01

LENGTH: 1012 words


Metro's move to put more police on trains after three recent subway robberies
may make passengers feel safer, but some area officials worry that shifting
officers from station parking lots could make riders more vulnerable to Metro's
most serious crime problem: auto theft.

Robberies aboard trains are rare for Metro, which is relatively safe compared
with other U.S. subway systems. But as is the case across the Washington area,
auto theft at Metro garages and parking lots has been rising in recent years.
More than 200 cars have been stolen from Metro's nearly 33,000 spaces so far
this year; there have been hundreds of other incidents in which thieves have
broken into cars and stolen money, cassettes, gym bags and other items.

Of the 11 Metro stations with the highest incidence of serious crime this year,
all but Metro Center have parking lots, which are filled each weekday with
hundreds of cars that commuters leave for hours at a time.

Many stations -- such as Deanwood, Rhode Island Avenue and Anacostia -- are in
parts of the District where crime rates are relatively high, while others --
such as Greenbelt and Vienna -- are in suburban areas surrounded by enormous
parking lots. At nearly all of these high-crime stations, car theft is the
biggest problem, statistics indicate.

Fairfax County Supervisor Gerald E. Connolly, whose Providence district includes
the Vienna station with its nearly 3,500 parking spaces, is demanding that Metro
officials not pull back from patrolling lots in order to put more officers on
trains.

"While I applaud your efforts to take decisive action against the rise in crime
on the Red Line, I am very concerned about the crime rate at the Vienna
station," Connolly wrote to Metro General Manager Richard A. White.

The challenge for Metro -- which at a time of stagnant ridership is reluctant to
spend much to increase its 240-person police force -- is to keep passengers
feeling secure without dropping its guard to car thieves. Metro has little
choice but to respond aggressively to high-visibility crimes on trains,
regardless of their rarity, because they produce fear, crime specialists say.

"Fear of crime is every bit as significant as crime itself," said Patrick
Murphy, a former New York City police commissioner who heads the national
Conference of Mayors' crime division. "You have to address that fear."

Attacks inside subway cars can be especially threatening.

"I think it's the sense of no exit, the loss of control," University of Maryland
criminologist Lawrence Sherman said. "It's the lack of any self-determination.
It's an exaggerated fear."

Metro Police Chief Barry McDevitt said he is looking for creative approaches to
crime prevention, such as analyzing data to see whether there are times when car
thieves are less likely to strike and then possibly freeing up some officers to
ride trains during those hours.

"We want to get more bang for our buck," McDevitt said. "We're not just robbing
Peter to pay Paul."

Despite the expense of hiring more officers -- about $ 68,000 an officer in
annual salary and benefits -- some transit officials say Metro might have to
bite the bullet.

"How much is enough?" Metro board member Carlton R. Sickles asked. "If it's
necessary to take officers out of parking lots to put them on trains, then
perhaps we don't have enough."

To counter passenger fear and deter future crime, McDevitt wants the officers he
does have to be more visible.

"We had gotten away from patrolling trains because there were so few crimes on
trains," he said. "Now, they'll be riding the trains, and going in and out of
cars, slamming those doors" at either end of each car.

Metro still has very little crime, especially compared with the communities
surrounding parts of its 89.5-mile rail system.

"Metro is fairly pro-active. Take graffiti. They erase it as soon as it occurs,"
said Joe Zelinka, public safety chief at the Metropolitan Washington Council of
Governments. "They take care of small things so they don't turn into big
things."

Much of the crime that does occur is committed by pickpockets. Already this
year, there have been 121 incidents, an increase over last year's 116. Forty-six
of those were at Metro Center, the system's most crowded station.

Many other crimes on Metro station property -- which includes not only station
platforms and trains but also station entrances and bus bays -- are caused by
young people and reflect the area's rising rate of juvenile crime, McDevitt
said.

The suspects in all three robberies aboard the Red Line this month were
described as young males.

Even when no crimes occur, groups of youngsters can unnerve some passengers.

"I was at a transit conference recently in London, and the accents were
different, but the problems were the same. You have loud and boisterous youths
in a confined space, and people feel threatened," Metro Deputy Police Chief
Polly L. Hanson said.

Young people also are the most prevalent car thieves in Metro's lots and
garages, McDevitt said.

"Unfortunately, auto theft is juvenile-driven," he said. "Most of our stolen
cars are taken for joy rides."

Some of the parking lots popular with thieves are near high schools. Both the
Vienna and Huntington stations in Northern Virginia, which have large parking
lots, are popular with auto thieves and are within a mile of high schools.

Despite this month's robberies, most passengers interviewed said they feel safe
on trains. But some worry about the parking lots.

Simpson, a computer specialist from Clinton who was heading to her car at the
Anacostia station's garage one recent afternoon, said she feels safe commuting
but worries when she reaches the lot.

"This being a secluded area, with stairwells, this is where police are needed
most," she said. However, she said, she's never had a problem in two years of
parking at the station.

Patent lawyer Robert Sterne, 45, of Oakton, said that his car was vandalized at
the Vienna lot and that he now drives a pickup truck to the station.

SECRET TIPS HELP SOLVE CRIMES

BYLINE: By CAROLYN BATTISTA

SECTION: Section 11CN; Page 18, Column 6; Connecticut Weekly Desk

LENGTH: 924 words


IN recent months an anonymous phone call helped the Willimantic Police
Department find and arrest a suspect in an armed robbery of a convenience store.
Another call helped the department make arrests in a drug case.

Although the callers never revealed their names, the first collected a reward of
$150 and the second, a reward of $200, because the Willimantic department works
with one of the state's five Crime Stoppers - organizations that provide both
anonymity and rewards (of up to $1,000) to callers supplying the police with
information leading to arrests for felonies.

Crime Stoppers work with the police in more than a dozen Connecticut
communities, and three more Crime Stoppers, involving nearly 30 communities, are
being planned. The Greater Waterbury Crime Stoppers, the state's oldest, was
formed in 1982; the Norfolk-Canaan Crime Stoppers, the newest, got under way
late last month.

''People see that Crime Stoppers is helping dramatically,'' said Virginia M.
Allen, director of the Crime Stoppers unit of the State Police in Hartford. She
added that as existing programs succeeded, she expected to see more communities
become interested in having their own Crime Stoppers.

Waterbury launched its program after studying the nation's first Crime Stoppers,
formed in Albuquerque, N.M., in 1976. In 1984, the state legislature created an
advisory council, attached to the Department of Public Safety, to encourage more
communities to start Crime Stoppers.

The Crime Stoppers unit of the state police was established in 1985 to help
communities start programs, by training program coordinators, for example. Each
Crime Stoppers is a private nonprofit organization, but the state pays the
salaries of the state police unit for Mrs. Allen and a secretary.

A statewide organization, Crime Stoppers of Connecticut, raises funds to help
start local programs and to operate News Alert, which sends out news releases on
particular unsolved crimes and asks people to call 1-800-445-TIPS with
information.

Each local Crime Stoppers operates independently, with a board of directors that
sets up and publicizes a telephone line that callers can use to give information
to the local police. The local boards also raise money for rewards.

Mrs. Allen said that Crime Stoppers nationwide had helped to solve more than
130,000 cases but that she did not yet have figures on the number of cases in
Connecticut.

Captain Harry Boyce of the Waterbury Police Department said the Greater
Waterbury Crime Stoppers program had resulted in more than 200 arrests for
homicides, armed robberies, rapes, drug dealing and other felonies. ''People
don't like to reveal themselves,'' Captain Boyce said, ''but they feel
comfortable with this.''

When the police receive a Crime Stoppers call, they assign the caller a code
number, which is used in any subsequent calls. The caller need never reveal his
or her name, even after an arrest is made and a reward is in order. Local police
recommend an amount for each award, based on the severity of the crime. The
boards of the local Crime Stoppers make arrangements to give the money to the
caller at an agreed upon location or to send it to a post office chosen by the
caller. Captain Boyce said that Waterbury awards had ranged from $100 to $500.

The callers, Captain Boyce noted, range from ''good citizens that refuse the
reward'' to prostitutes and drug dealers who feel somebody has wronged them.
''They call in to get even,'' he said. Sometimes, he added, streetwise people
figure, ''I know what's going on; I'll make a few bucks.''

Captain Boyce also cited a man whose call backfired. He had reported the names
of two suspects in a burglary. Instead of getting an award, the caller was
arrested along with the other suspects, the captain said.

The Northeastern Connecticut Crime Stoppers, organized in March of this year,
works mainly in Windham, Willimantic and Mansfield. It also covers Ashford,
Chaplin, Columbia and Coventry. The Willimantic Police Benevolent Association
recently raffled off government bonds to add $575 to the organization's coffers,
said Anthony Mamunes of the Willimantic Police.

Arthur Delmonte, crime prevention coordinator for the Bridgeport Police
Department, said he has been urging clubs to raise money for rewards for the
local Crime Stoppers, which began in June. ''Getting the money is the hardest
part,'' Mr. Delmonte said.

The Canaan-Norfolk Crime Stoppers was recently formed after local merchants
experienced several fires, said Richard Hefter, the president of Optimum
Resources of Norfolk. After one suspicious fire, Mr, Hefter recalled, ''one
merchant got a call from a distraught woman who said, 'I know what hap pened,
but I can't talk about it.' ''

Now looking to start a regional Crime Stoppers is the Law Enforcement Council of
Eastern Connecticut, an administrative arm of the police in Clinton, East Lyme,
Groton, Ledyard, Montville, New London, North Stonington, Norwich, Old Saybrook,
Plainfield, Putnam, Stonington and Waterford. ''We've been getting names of
people who might serve on the board of directors,'' said Frederick H. Avery Sr.,
director of the council.

Mrs. Allen said that Northwest Connecticut Crime Stoppers (for Torrington and
Winchester) is also in operation. She said other communities planning to start
Crime Stoppers included Enfield and neighboring towns (East Windsor, Granby,
Sommers, Suffield, South Windsor, Windsor and Windsor Locks) and Middletown and
its neighbors (Cromwell, East Hampton, and Portland).

F.B.I. SAYS CRIME REPORTS IN THE U.S. ROSE 4% in '85

BYLINE: UPI

SECTION: Section A; Page 10, Column 4; National Desk

LENGTH: 484 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 24


Reported crime jumped 4 percent in 1985, with even bigger increases in the South
and West, after declining the three previous years, the Federal Bureau of
Investigation said today.

But experts agreed that the overall increases in all categories of crime and all
regions of the country were not statistically significant and that it was too
early to predict a trend.

The bureau, releasing its Uniform Crime Report, said the biggest leap, 8
percent, showed up in the South. Crime rose 5 percent in the West, 2 percent in
the Northeast and stayed the same in the Middle West, the report said.

Crime statistics fluctuate and a one-year change is not particularly
significant, according to Richard Bennett of American University. Trends over
long periods are more significant, he said.

It Dropped in Earlier Years

Before the 1985 increase, the agency reported, crime dropped 3 percent from 1981
to 1982, 7 percent from 1982 to 1983 and 2 percent from 1983 to 1984.

''No matter how we try to explain crime rates going up, we don't seem to do it
very well,'' said Mr. Bennett, who is working on a worldwide study of crime
statistics. ''The increase is not very big and it may just be a random
increase.''

Robert Figlio, an expert on crime figures at the University of Pennsylvania,
said, ''We have to wait several years to see if we've got a real trend.''

The figures showed that New York City recorded almost as many murders as Detroit
and Los Angeles combined, although the number, 1,384, was smaller than in 1984.

Motor Vehicle Theft Up 6%

Motor vehicle theft and aggravated assault jumped 6 percent, larceny theft and
violent crime 5 percent, property crime and forcible rape 4 percent, robbery and
arson 3 percent, burglary 2 percent and murder 1 percent.

Four major cities reported more than 500 murders in 1985: 666 in Chicago; 635 in
Detroit, up from 514 in 1984; 777 in Los Angeles, up from 759 in 1984, and 1,384
in New York City, down from 1,450 in 1984. Houston also registered 457 murders
in 1985, down from 473 in 1984.

There were no comparison figures for Chicago from 1984.

The nation's big cities recorded the most forcible rapes, with those reporting
more than 1,000: New York with 3,880, up from 3,829 in 1984; followed by Los
Angeles, 2,318, down from 2,347 in 1984; Chicago, 1,792; Houston, 1,711, up from
1,269 in 1984; Detroit, 1,579, up from 1,519 in 1984; Dallas, 1,149, up from
1,022 in 1984, and Philadelphia, 1,021, up from 937 in 1984.

Areas where declines in crime were reported included a drop in property crime of
1 percent in the Middle West; murder decreased 3 percent in the Northeast and 1
percent in the South; robbery decreased 2 percent in the Middle West; burglary
decreased 3 percent in the Middle West; motor vehicle theft decreased 1 percent
in the Northeast and 2 percent in the Middle West and arson dropped 1 percent in
the Middle West.

Murders, assaults take U.S. crime up

BYLINE: STEVEN EDWARDS, CanWest News Service

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A14

LENGTH: 303  words

DATELINE: NEW YORK


The United States became a more dangerous place in 2005, with more murders,
robberies and aggravated assaults leading the largest annual rise in the violent
crime rate since 2001, the FBI reported yesterday.

The number of murder victims exceeded 16,900 while there were at least 92,837
forcible rapes and almost 420,000 robberies.

Among big U.S. cities, Dallas emerged as the most dangerous, with economically
depressed Detroit a close second, while New York again enjoyed being dubbed the
safest.

Experts differed on whether the statistics show the United States to be
significantly more dangerous than Canada, with one leading scholar arguing most
crime rates are similar except for homicide.

"The U.S. is higher in gun crime, but Canada has higher burglary rates, it has
higher theft rates, it has equivalent assault rates: it is a high crime
society," said Marcus Felson, a professor at the School of Criminal Justice of
Rutgers University in Newark, N.J. "Western Canada is a very high crime society,
while eastern Canada is moderate like New York, but that's partly for the wrong
reason, namely it is too cold in winter to commit much crime."

Statistics Canada will publish Canada's 2005 crime statistics next month, but
annually warns against comparing them with the FBI list because the Canadian
roundup considers a greater number of violent offences.

Individual spikes in violence are explainable.

For example, the arrival in Houston of thousands of people fleeing Hurricane
Katrina-ravaged New Orleans - long known as a high crime city - could have
contributed to the 23-per-cent rise in the Texas city's murder rate, to 334 from
272.

"When new teenagers show up, they upset the pecking order," said Felson, whose
latest book, Crime and Nature, explores crime's symbiotic relationships with
society's legal activities.

Dec. 19--Crime statistics always generate a lot of buzz when they're released.

Law enforcement officials either tout them or dismiss them, depending on where
their city or metro area landed.

The latest list comes courtesy of CQ Press, which released "City Crime Rankings
2010-2011: Crime in Metropolitan America."

It came out last month and got some press coverage, generally for cities that
had the highest crime rates, such as St. Louis followed by Camden, N.J.;
Detroit; Flint, Mich.; and Oakland.

Poor Oakland.

Yuba City and Marysville didn't make the city list because their populations
aren't big enough.

But don't forget the Metropolitan Statistical Area. Yes, thanks to the Census
Bureau back in the 1980s, Yuba and Sutter counties became one for various
statistical and other governmental purposes.

So while most of the publicity went to the crime-ridden cities, there was also a
crime ranking of 347 metro areas, including, as it's called, Yuba City.

So where did the Yuba City MSA rate? Actually, fairly well.

Leading the way for crime was, of course, the Detroit metro area.

In the listing of highest to lowest crime rates, Yuba-Sutter was 216th. In fact,
this metro area's crime score was -23.03, meaning its composite crime number was
below the national rate.

Actually, Yuba City was far better off than Chico (117th) or Sacramento (88th).

(There was also a listing of lowest to highest. Same crime score, but in the
reverse order. Yuba-Sutter? It ranked at 132 in this list.)

Oddly, Yuba-Sutter had roughly the same level of crime as the New York-White
Plains metro area, which is something to ponder.

The crime score was based on reports of incidents, such as murder, rape,
robbery, aggravated assault, burglary and motor vehicle theft. CQ crunched its
figures based on FBI reporting for 2009.

CQ, which has been compiling these numbers for almost two decades, acknowledged
that not everybody is in agreement when it comes to quantifying crime rates and
trends.

"The FBI, police, and many criminologists caution against rankings according to
crime rates. They correctly point out that crime levels are affected by many
different factors," CQ said in a press release.

Some of those factors include population density, composition of the population
(particularly the concentration of youth), climate, economic conditions,
strength of local law enforcement agencies, citizen attitudes toward crime,
cultural factors, education levels, crime reporting practices of citizens and
family cohesiveness.

While some may dismiss crime ranking as "simplistic" or "incomplete," CQ said,
"this criticism is largely based on the fact that there are reasons for the
differences in crime rates, not that the rates are incompatible.

"The rankings tell an interesting and an important story regarding crime in the
United States. Annual rankings not only allow for comparisons among different
states and cities, but also enable leaders to track their communities' crime
trends from one year to the next."

Violent crime rate lowest since 1978 Overall crime is down also, new FBI report
says

BYLINE: Toni Locy

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 596 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON


WASHINGTON -- Crime across the USA was down for the eighth straight
year in 1999, resulting in the lowest rates for murder and violent
crime in decades, according to a new FBI report.

In its annual crime report, the FBI says serious crime -- murder,
rape, robbery and aggravated assault -- dropped by 7% last year
from 1998. The violent crime rate of 525 offenses per 100,000
inhabitants last year was the lowest rate since 1978. Last year's
murder rate of nearly six per 100,000 inhabitants was the lowest
since 1966.


But criminologists say the numbers show signs that the party is
almost over. "The 1990s have been wonderful," says James Alan
Fox, professor of criminology at Northeastern University in Boston.
But "all good things must end."

The decreases in murder in large cities slowed in 1999, dropping
3%, compared with an 11% fall in 1998. Fox says it reflects what's
happening in large cities such as New York and Boston, where the
numbers of homicides are creeping back up.

Fox says that such increases are inevitable. "It's Newton's Law
of Criminology. If he had studied criminology, he would've said
what goes up, must come down. And what comes down, must go up."

The FBI's report is based on figures it receives from police departments
that willingly participate. Not all departments do, but the annual
numbers are the most comprehensive available.

Property crimes -- burglary, larceny, arson and motor vehicle
theft -- also fell 7% last year compared with 1998. Aggravated
assaults accounted for 64% of violent crime, while robberies made
up 29%. Murder accounted for 1% of violent crime.

There also was a slight increase in murders and robberies committed
with guns. In 1999, firearms were used in 65.2% of the murders,
compared with 64.9% in 1998. Guns were used in 39.9% of the robberies
committed in 1999, compared with 38.2% in 1998.

Alfred Blumstein, director of the National Consortium on Violence
Research in Pittsburgh, says the increase in gun-related crime
is a "blip" and represents a leveling off after a drop from
1997 and 1998.

The South, the country's most populous region, still leads the
country in crime, accounting for 41% of the total. The West had
23% of reported crimes, while the Midwest and Northeast were responsible
for 22% and 14%, respectively.

So why is crime continuing to decline? Criminologists such as
Blumstein and Fox say no one factor deserves all the credit. Rather,
it is a combination of efforts.

Blumstein, co-editor of The Crime Drop in America, scheduled
to be released soon, says crackdowns on guns, particularly efforts
aimed at taking them out of the hands of juveniles, is a major
factor. Gun violence by juveniles played a key role in driving
up crime rates in the late 1980s, Blumstein says.

Criminologists say federally mandated background checks on gun
buyers have helped. So has the incarceration boom, fueled by an
increasing number of states that have limited or banned parole.
There are more than 2 million inmates in state and federal prisons.

Blumstein says changes in the drug markets and a reduced demand
for drugs have contributed to the drop. The economy also deserves
credit, he says. Drug-dealing and other crime holds less allure
when people can get jobs, he says.

DEBATE;
President is right to focus on crime

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 8A

LENGTH: 448 words


Crime. Violent crime. It's everywhere. We are all at risk.

One in 133 of us will be murdered, the Justice Department estimates. Five of six
will be robbed, raped, assaulted.

No wonder people, even in small towns, are putting bars on their windows. No
wonder even rural residents lock their gates behind them. They're scared.

That's no way to live. Families are being held prisoners in their own homes.
Criminals are controlling the streets.

President Bush took an important step Monday to ''take back the streets.'' He
proposed a $ 1.2 billion plan to hire new federal agents and prosecutors, build
new prisons and increase the penalties for gun-related crimes.

Some people, like the writer across this page, say that's a mistake. They say he
should treat the causes of crime instead of the symptoms. That's not enough.

Ending hunger, homelessness and poverty and improving education are important
national goals.

But our homes and streets won't be safe until criminals know they will be
arrested, prosecuted and imprisoned for breaking the law.

Crime isn't a problem just in New York, Los Angeles or Chicago - big cities with
a violent crime rate 57% higher than small-town USA.

It's also a problem in small cities where violent crime is growing three times
faster than in metropolitan areas.

Just this past weekend, a 9-year-old and his mother were attacked in their
Ballwin, Mo., home and stabbed by two teenagers. Two men sitting at a bar in
Dayton, Ohio, were killed when a young man began shooting because the bartender
asked for his ID.

Bush's anti-crime proposal is just a step. Nothing more. His proposals apply
basically to federal crimes. They are not going to eliminate crime. Make no
mistake about that.

But someone has to provide leadership. Someone has to set the tone. Someone has
to emphasize that fighting crime will cost money. A lot of it.

That someone must be the president. He's the one who can focus national
attention. He's the one who can set national priorities.

And, appropriately, the president challenged local officials - state governors,
city mayors and county officials - to enlist in the war on crime.

The war cannot be fought without them.

Cracking down on crime means state and local governments, like the federal
government, will need more police, more prosecutors, more judges and more
prisons.

State and local officials will have to provide the leadership to convince their
constitutents that fighting crime has a price tag. But that it's worth the cost.

Congress should weigh Bush's proposals with caution. Civil liberties must not be
trampled in panic.

And the president should not waste time waiting for a study to decide whether to
ban assault weapons that are made to kill people. No study is needed. Ban them.

But families shouldn't have to barricade themselves in their homes at night.
They shouldn't be behind iron bars and locked doors.

Criminals should.

City fifth in violence crime

BYLINE: Shaun Sutner

SECTION: LOCAL NEWS; Pg. A3

LENGTH: 548 words

DATELINE: WORCESTER


WORCESTER - While the city's property crime rate has gradually declined by more
than 30 percent over a 15-year period, its violent crime rate has not changed,
according to a new report by The Research Bureau.

Meanwhile, Worcester's violent crime rate ranks it fifth among the 10 largest
New England cities - with a rate of violent crime that is higher than Providence
and Boston, but lower than New Haven, Conn., Springfield, Hartford and
Bridgeport, Conn.

In 2010, there were 35.6 percent fewer property crimes in Worcester, such as
burglary, larceny, theft, shoplifting and vandalism, than there were in 1995,
but only 2.1 percent fewer violent crimes such as murders, assaults and
robberies, according to the bureau's report, "Benchmarking Public Safety in
Worcester: 2012."

The report, which consists mainly of charts and short explanations of the
statistics, is the eighth such public safety benchmarking report that has been
issued by the bureau, an independent nonprofit funded by corporations,
foundations, universities and individuals that tracks the city's finances and
administration.

Police Chief Gary J. Gemme said he is reviewing the report.

While Worcester had more violent crime overall than Providence, the Rhode Island
city with which it is often compared, Providence generally has had more murders
than Worcester. In 2010, Providence had 15 murders compared to Worcester's
seven; in 2009, Providence had 24 murders, while Worcester had seven.

The report also found that in 2010, Worcester ranked sixth of the 10 biggest New
England cities in terms of police staffing levels.

Waterbury, Conn., Providence, Bridgeport, New Haven, Conn., Hartford and Boston
all had more uniformed employees on average per 1,000 residents, according to
data compiled by the bureau from the FBI's 2010 crime survey.

With a staffing rate of 2.3 uniformed employees per 1,000 residents, Worcester
has more uniformed officers than Springfield, Manchester, N.H., and Stamford,
Conn. The 2.3 rate is above the average rate of 1.8 for cities with 100,000 to
250,000 residents, according to the FBI.

The report also evaluated the effects of the economic recession on crime rates
and staffing levels in the Worcester Police and Fire departments.

The recession had no significant effect on crime trends in the city, with
similar rates for murder, shootings, aggravated assault, robbery, burglary,
shoplifting, larceny, prostitution and drug offenses from 2007 to 2011.

However, the number of uniformed positions in the Worcester Police Department is
down 11 percent since the late 1990s, with 64 fewer positions since 1998, a
decline of 11 percent.

Fire Department staffing levels are also down, but only 2 percent, or eight
positions, the report said.

Firefighter workloads have increased, but mainly in emergency medical services.
The number of structure fires decreased from 716 in 2002 to 627 in 2011, while
first responder and rescue calls shot up from 14,624 to 19,857 over the same
period.

Emergency medical service workload for UMass Memorial EMS rose more than 30
percent from 2002 to 2011, while the average response time declined by 55
seconds, according to the report.

FBI: Violent crime down in Dayton;
Statistics, however, show that property crimes have increased.

BYLINE: By Doug Page Staff Writer

SECTION: LOCAL; Pg. A3

LENGTH: 295 words


DAYTON - The FBI's 2010 preliminary snapshot of Dayton crime showed violent
crime was down 8 percent for the first six months of the year, while property
crimes increased 6 percent when compared to the first half of 2009.

FBI figures for all of 2009 showed violent crime in the city dropped 8 percent
when compared to 2008. Property crime also was down in 2009 by 5 percent.

Part of the surge in property crime through the first half of this year can be
traced to burglaries.

"The vast majority of the complaints that come into the district headquarters
are about break-ins of cars and houses," said Maj. Mark Hess, head of patrol
operations. FBI figures showed reported burglaries rose from 1,276 in 2009 to
1,429 in the first half of this year. Theft from vehicles is not tracked by the
FBI. Police department statistics, however, show that through the first half of
2010 there were 909 such thefts compared to 739 during the same period in 2009.

The FBI reported violent crimes in Dayton dropped from 739 in the first six
months of 2009 to 680 in the first half of 2010. Property crimes rose from 3,931
in the first half of 2009 to 4,170 through this June.

Nationally, the FBI data indicated the nation saw a 6.2 percent decrease in the
number of reported violent crimes and a 2.8 percent decrease in the number of
reported property crimes in the first six months of this year compared to the
same time period of 2009.

All of the six Ohio cities with a population more than 100,000 - Akron,
Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus, Dayton and Toledo - showed decreases in
reported violent crimes. Only Cleveland and Columbus showed a decrease in
property crimes. Toledo data was excluded from property crimes data because it
did not conform to the reporting standards, the FBI said.

Statistical snapshot;
West Virginia often ranks near high or low in the nation

BYLINE: Paul J. Nyden

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. P7A

Statistics about crime rates, geography, labor and employment patterns portray
West Virginia as an interesting place, with those numbers often near the top or
bottom of national lists, according to the 2006 Statistical Abstract of the
United States, published by the U.S. Census Bureau.

Mountain State residents were much less likely to be victims of violent crimes -
murders, rapes, robberies and aggravated assaults - than people in other states.

In 2003, 258 out of every 100,000 West Virginians were victims of those crimes,
compared to a national average of 475 of every 100,000 people.

Only eight states, all with large rural populations, had lower violent crime
rates: Idaho, Utah, Wisconsin, South Dakota, New Hampshire, Vermont, Maine and
North Dakota. In the state with the lowest rate, North Dakotans suffered only 78
violent crimes for every 100,000 residents.

West Virginians were less likely to be victims of identity theft than people in
all but four other states: Vermont, Maine, North Dakota and South Dakota.

In 2004, just 34.2 of every 100,000 West Virginians were victims of identity
theft. States with the highest rates were Arizona, Nevada, California and Texas.
Washington, D.C., had a higher rate than any state.

Geography and voting

West Virginia has the smallest water surface of any state in the country, and
almost all that water is flowing down creeks and rivers. The Mountain State also
has a few man-made lakes, such as those created by the R.D. Bailey Dam and the
Summersville Dam.

The other states with the lowest percentages of water surface are arid
Southwestern states - New Mexico and Arizona - or small New England states -
Vermont, Connecticut and New Hampshire.

The federal government owns 8.2 percent of all the land in West Virginia, in
places like the Monongahela National Forest and the New River Gorge. That figure
is well below the national percentage of 29.6 percent.

The federal government owns nearly 92 percent of the land in Nevada, including
major military bases and training areas, and two-thirds of all the surface area
in Alaska, Utah and Idaho.

Federally owned lands make up less than 1 percent of the surface in five states:
Connecticut, Rhode Island, Maine, New York and Iowa.

West Virginia ranked 43rd in the number of toxic waste sites. It had only nine
Environmental Protection Agency Superfund sites in 2004.

States with the most Superfund sites were New Jersey, 114; Pennsylvania, 96;
California, 95; and New York, 91.

The highest temperature ever recorded in West Virginia was 112 degrees
Fahrenheit in Martinsburg on July 10, 1936. The lowest was minus 37 degrees in
Lewisburg on Dec. 30, 1917.

The percentage of West Virginians of voting age who cast votes in recent
national elections has been slightly below the national average.

In the 2000 presidential election, 46.1 percent of all West Virginians over 18
voted. In 2004, 52.8 percent did.

In 2004, the national voting rate was 55.5 percent. More than 70 percent of all
eligible voters went to the polls in Minnesota, Maine and Wisconsin.

Employment and wages

West Virginia has the lowest percentages of adults over 16 - both male and
female - holding jobs of any other state in the nation.

In the Mountain State, 60.8 percent of all adult men held jobs in 2004, while
49.1 percent of all adult women did. National averages that year were 73.3
percent for men and 59.2 percent for women.

More than 80 percent of all adult males in three states held jobs: Nebraska,
Colorado and Minnesota. More than two-thirds of all adult females in four states
were working: South Dakota, Minnesota, Nebraska and North Dakota.

The average annual pay earned by a West Virginia worker in 2003 was $29,284,
compared to the national average of $37,765.

Workers in four Northeastern states enjoyed the highest average annual pay:
Connecticut, New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts. Workers in only six states
had a lower average wage than West Virginia: Montana, South Dakota, Mississippi,
North Dakota, Idaho and Arkansas.

The percentage of workers organized in labor unions has been dropping
dramatically across the country, but West Virginia has always been above the
national averages.

Nationally, for all jobs, the percentage of union workers dropped from 20.1
percent to 12.5 percent between 1983 and 2004. Nationally, for private sector
jobs only, that percentage fell from 16.5 percent to 7.9 percent for those same
years.

In West Virginia, 26.1 percent of all private-sector employees were union
members in 2003, a higher percentage than any other state in the nation.

By 2004, union workers were only 10.5 percent of the West Virginia work force,
dropping it to eighth in the country.

The drop in union workers came largely from the decline in jobs in the state's
major industries, including coal, chemicals, steel, aluminum and glass making.

Today, states with the highest percentage of unionized private sector workers
are Hawaii, Michigan, Washington, Illinois and Minnesota.

North Carolina, the least unionized state in the nation for decades, remained at
the bottom in 2004, with just 1.6 percent of its private sector workers in
unions.

West Virginians employed by state agencies in 2003 made $2,939 a month, compared
to the national average of $3,751 a month for state employees.

Those employed by local governments earned $2,855 a month, compared to a
national average of $3,529 monthly.

Federal funds

In 2003, West Virginia received $7,858 in federal funds for each of its
residents, compared to the national average of $6,910 in federal funds per
capita.

Eleven states received higher per capita payments from federal funds, topped by
Alaska, $12,224; Virginia, $11,163; and Maryland, $10,464.

Part of the reason is that West Virginia has always been near the bottom in
receiving federal defense money, with $510 million in 2003.

Only Wyoming and South Dakota received less. The states that received the most
defense funds were: California, $39.2 billion; Virginia, $32.7 billion; and
Texas, $30.4 billion.

EDITORIAL: There's safety in Crime Stoppers

BYLINE: The Santa Fe New Mexican

SECTION: COMMENTARY

LENGTH: 889 words


Nov. 14--Good news for Santa Fe residents worried about crime -- the Santa Fe
Police Department wants to revive Santa Fe Crime Stoppers.

The nonprofit takes anonymous tips about unsolved crimes and fugitive criminals,
handing out cash as a reward. Its existence can help lead to arrests in crimes
both large and small. Santa Fe dissolved its group in 2014, just about the time
a tipster told the attorney general that the local group was mishandling money.
If Crime Stoppers does return, its first order of business will be investigating
that tip by asking the attorney general to conduct a forensic audit on the
group's books. That's as it should be.

Officer William Cordova is organizing the revival and is seeking applications
for board members to oversee Crime Stoppers. This is good timing, especially
since Crime Stoppers is celebrating its 40th anniversary this year. The group
started in Albuquerque back in 1976 and expanded worldwide, with programs in 24
countries. Cordova, who is organizing the effort, is accepting applications at
505-955-5218 or wwcordova@santafenm.gov All candidates will undergo background
checks.

Gathering information that can help solve crimes is a smart move. Maybe, with a
tip line up and running, police will get information on auto burglars, rapists
and other criminals who make citizens feel unsafe. More broadly, a program such
as Crime Stoppers can work to prevent new crimes -- they stop the criminal
before he or she goes too far -- and helps community and police work together. A
community where officers and citizens communicate is safer.

Let's hope this revival takes place quickly, and by the new year, a renewed
Crime Stoppers board is up and running for Santa Fe County.

Voters want solutions

The New York Times

Frustrated by a do-nothing Congress, voters took policy matters into their own
hands last week by passing state ballot proposals to legalize marijuana, approve
new transportation projects, raise state minimum wages and strengthen gun
control laws. That these progressive measures won is an indication that voters
are moving left on many issues, despite Donald Trump's victory.

Marijuana wins big: California, Massachusetts, Maine and Nevada voted to
legalize recreational use of marijuana. Voters in Arkansas, Florida, North
Dakota and Montana passed measures to make the drug available for medical use.
With these new laws, more than 20 percent of the American population lives in a
state or territory that has legalized the recreational use of marijuana. This
should push Trump and the next Congress to remove the drug from the Controlled
Substances Act and repeal federal criminal penalties for possessing small
quantities of marijuana. This would give states that are moving ahead with
legalization certainty that the federal government will not try to thwart their
policies.

Support for mass transit: Residents of Los Angeles, Seattle, the San Francisco
Bay Area and elsewhere across the country voted to increase local taxes to
expand and improve rail lines, bus service and roads and bridges. Los Angeles
County's Measure M, which will invest $120 billion over 40 years in a
fast-growing transit system, won the support of nearly 70 percent of voters. In
the Seattle area, Sound Transit will invest $54 billion over 25 years in
expanding its system, and the Bay Area Rapid Transit system will put $3.5
billion into rebuilding its network. These were all big victories for commuters
and should encourage Congress to appropriate more federal matching funds to
infrastructure projects.

Higher minimum wages in blue and red states: Arizona, Colorado, Maine and
Washington voted to raise their state minimum wages to at least $12 an hour by
2020 and to automatically adjust them for inflation after that. Maine also will
raise the subminimum tipped wage. The initiatives in Arizona and Washington also
provided for minimum paid sick leave. And in South Dakota, a ballot proposition
that would have established a lower state minimum for non-tipped workers under
age 18 failed by a large margin. These measures, adding to the recent wave of
state and local minimum wage increases around the country, show again that
voters want to alleviate working-class poverty and that the $7.25-an-hour
federal minimum wage, which Congress last increased in 2009, is woefully
inadequate.

Stronger gun control: Voters in California approved Proposition 63, mandating
background checks for ammunition purchases, banning large-capacity magazines
that can hold more than 10 cartridges and requiring law enforcement to
confiscate the weapons of newly convicted felons. In Washington, a majority
backed a proposal to give judges the power to seize the weapons of people deemed
a threat to public safety or their families. And Nevada residents approved a
proposal to expand background checks for private gun sales with a few
exceptions, like sales to immediate family members. However, a similar proposal
in Maine was defeated.

If Trump's election was a reflection of voter anger with the Washington
establishment, these initiatives are a clear signal that many Americans are
clamoring for solutions that will make their lives better.

The fight against crime must be fought locally

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 12A

LENGTH: 316 words


Tonight is National Night Out. And people across the USA will take to the
streets to support the fight against crime.

The effort is symbolic of a simple fact: Crime may be a national problem, but
it's a local nightmare.

It's the nightmare of a threefold increase in murders for Camden, N.J., during
the first three months this year. It's a 20% jump in crime in Anderson, S.C.,
early last year. It's a 250% increase in the homicide rate for children in
Detroit over a decade.

Politicians, including President Bush and his challenger, Gov. Bill Clinton,
often talk tough about crime. And certainly, the federal government can help. A
federal seven-day waiting period for gun purchases, supported by Clinton but
opposed by Bush, could reduce the more than 8,000 handgun deaths annually.

But federal prisons hold only 5% of the nation's criminals. Federal laws govern
less than 5% of the nation's crimes. Federal agents amount to only 5% of the
USA's law enforcement.

So, no matter how strongly both men support the death penalty or other ''tough''
measures, they can't end the spree of murders, rape and robbery that has been
rising since 1984 despite a 50% increase in incarcerations.

The real answers must come locally. Fortunately, Bush and Clinton both would
encourage states and communities to find new ways to fight crime.

Bush's Weed and Seed program rewards local efforts to weed out violence and
plant an education and work ethic among urban youth.

Clinton would help fund local crime plans that include community policing and
drug treatment.

Most crime is local. Most answers must be local, too.

Local initiatives in the crime fight:

- New York City: Community patrols help cut crime 6.7% this year.

- Reno, Nev.: Counseling program helps cut daytime juvenile crime 64%.

- Alabama: Alternative sentencing in three-county area results in no repeat
offenders.

Atlanta, Used to Praise, Confronts Crime Ranking

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

SECTION: Section A; Page 27, Column 1; National Desk

LENGTH: 644 words

DATELINE: ATLANTA, April 26


After years of promoting itself as one of the nation's premier centers for
economic growth, Atlanta now finds itself trying to refute figures indicating
that it leads the nation in something less enviable: crime.

Last month, amid a barrage of publicity about crime and drug problems in the
District of Columbia, officials there distributed figures showing that 15 cities
had higher crime rates than Washington did last year, with Atlanta ranking first
on a list of 31.

This week, an analysis of preliminary crime statistics for 1988 from the Federal
Bureau of Investigation showed Atlanta with the nation's leading rate of violent
crimes.

Distortions in Figures Cited

Atlanta officials say the figures are distorted because they are based on the
city's population. The potential pool of crime victims is much bigger than the
city's actual population, they say, because so many out-of-towners and
suburbanites come to Atlanta for work, conventions or recreation.

Furthermore, city officials say, Atlanta residents are more likely to report
crime than are residents in some other cities. For instance, the figures
distributed by the District of Colmubia showed 721 rapes in Atlanta in 1988,
compared with 165 in Washington, which has a larger population. Atlanta
officials say the wide disparity probably reflects differences in reporting
rather than in the extent of crime.

''We have a problem right here in River City, I don't deny that,'' said Atlanta
Public Safety Commissioner George Napper, ''but there's no way we're like New
York, like Los Angeles, like Chicago, like Detroit, like D.C.''

Comparative rankings aside, the figures are a reminder that despite the
prosperity of its metropolitan area, the city of Atlanta remains largely poor,
black and troubled. The city, now 70 percent black, has about 430,000 residents.
The Atlanta metropolitan area, the nation's 13th largest, has 2.6 million
residents.

Crime problems are not new to Atlanta. In 1979, with a soaring murder rate and
nationwide publicity about crime here, Gov. George Busbee, acting on a request
from Mayor Maynard Jackson, called in Georgia State Patrol troopers to help
patrol the downtown.

From Murder to Larceny

The figures distributed by the District of Columbia last month were part of a
study by the District's government that showed Atlanta ranking first nationally
in serious crimes in relation to population, from murder to larceny. The study,
which was attributed to unpublished data from police departments in 31 cities,
showed Atlanta with 78,087 such crimes in 1988, or 18.2 for every 100 residents.
That was 16,000 more than the District of Columbia, which has 190,000 more
people. The rate in Washington was 9.2 for each 100 citizens.

The study showed Fort Worth, Dallas and Seattle following Atlanta in crime
rates, with Washington 16th, Chicago 17th and New York 18th.

The reserchers reported that Washington, which is grappling with a wave of
drug-related violence, led Atlanta in homicides in 1988. Washington had 369,
Atlanta 217. But Atlanta led in rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary,
larceny and auto theft.

The F.B.I.'s figures, from its preliminary Uniform Crime Report for 1988,
received considerable attention here.

F.B.I. Does Not Compare

F.B.I. officials say they do not use the figures to create rankings of cities
because there are too many variables to make comparisons worthwhile. But news
organizations used the statistics to make comparisons and these rankings showed
Atlanta with the nation's highest rate last year of four violent crimes: murder,
rape, aggravated assault and robbery. Atlanta's rate was 3,576 such crimes for
each 100,000 citizens, which was a 23 percent increase over 1987.

The figures indicated that highest rate of overall crime, including burglary,
larceny and car theft, was in Miami Beach.

CRIME FIGURE AT TRIAL TELLS OF CASINO SCHEME

BYLINE: Special to the New York Times

SECTION: Section 1; Part 1, Page 37, Column 1; National Desk

LENGTH: 644 words

DATELINE: KANSAS CITY, Mo., Nov. 23


Leaders of organized crime in four Middle Western cities joined to press a
pension fund of the teamsters' union to grant loans with which they gained
control of four Las Vegas gambling casinos, according to testimony from Angelo
Lonardo, who said he participated in the operation.

Mr. Lonardo testified Friday in the ninth week of the Federal trial here of
eight reputed crime leaders charged with skimming $2 million in profits from the
four casinos.

It was the first day of testimony for Mr. Lonardo, who is in the Federal Witness
Protection Program. Mr. Lonardo said he was the No. 2 man in organized crime in
Cleveland before being imprisoned for narcotics violations in 1983.

Mr. Lonardo, 74 years old, said crime leaders from Kansas City, Milwaukee and
Cleveland used the votes of pension fund trustees they controlled to get $86
million in union loans that were used to finance the acquisition of the casinos.


How Skimming Worked

The casinos were the Fremont, Hacienda, Marina and Stardust, were owned by the
Argent Corporation, which was headed by Allen R. Glick. Mr. Glick has testified
that crime leaders told him he would be killed if he interfered with the
skimming operation.

The skimming involved taking money off the top of the casinos' gambling receipts
before the receipts were entered in the casinos' books or reported to tax
agencies.

Mr. Glick testified that the crime leaders told him they controlled the Central
States Pension Fund of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and would
decide whether to grant him loans.

Once the casinos were owned by the Argent Corporation, the crime organizations
in the three cities began to receive packages containing tens of thousands of
dollars each month, Mr. Lonardo testified. $40,000 a Month to Cleveland He said
Cleveland usually received about $40,000 each month, beginning in 1974, but
added that the amount sometimes climbed as high as $100,000. The money was
distributed among crime leaders, he said.

Some money was also given to the pension fund trustees who had helped swing the
loans, he said. Roy L. Williams, the former teamsters' president, has testified
at the trial that he also received $1,500 a month from Kansas City crime
leaders.

Mr. Lonardo said a dispute over the money arose between Milwaukee and Kansas
City, and Nick Civella, who has since died but was then the reputed crime leader
in Kansas City, and Frank Balistrieri, a defendant who the prosecutors say is
the crime leader in Milwaukee, asked Chicago crime leaders to arbitrate the
dispute.

Joseph John Aiuppa, Chicago's crime leader according to the prosecutors, and
John Peter Cerone, reportedly another leading Chicago crime figure, mediated but
then began taking 25 percent of the money skimmed from the casinos for the
Chicago organization, Mr. Lonardo said.

'Chicago Was Their Boss'

''Chicago was their boss,'' Mr. Lonardo testified. ''Kansas City and Milwaukee
belong to Chicago. Cleveland reports to New York.''

Mr. Lonardo said leaders of crime organizations also decided who would win the
presidency and other top positions in the teamsters union.

While Frank Fitzsimmons, then the teamsters' president, was dying in 1979, crime
figures from Cleveland and Kansas City met with their counterparts in Chicago to
discuss who would succeed him, Mr. Lonardo said.

They decided to support Mr. Williams, who was elected in 1981 after the death of
Mr. Fitzsimmons, but resigned two years later when he was convicted of
conspiring to bribe a United States senator.

Mr. Lonardo is the first important organized crime figure to testify at the
skimming trial. He was sentenced to life in prison without parole plus 103 years
for his narcotics convictions, but the life sentence was set aside and he was
made eligible for parole in exchange for his cooperation and testimony in this
case.

DEBATE;
Press the drug war to help fight crime

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 8A

LENGTH: 500 words


The drug disease has left us vulnerable to another infection - a crime epidemic.

Burglaries, robberies, murders and maimings are thriving in the drug- weakened
society.

The most recent FBI Uniform Crime Report says that we're far from finding a
cure. Serious crimes rose in 1989 for the fifth straight year.

The number of reported violent crimes rose 5% in 1989. Murders were up 4%.
Property crimes rose 2%.

Illicit drugs bear most of the blame for this crime.

No community - large or small - is immune.

- Atlanta, Ga. was the crime capital among big cities for the second year in a
row, with the highest rate of serious crimes reported - 210 per 1,000
population.

- Bridgeport, Conn. was the murder capital of the Northeast, with a higher
murder rate than New York or Boston.

- Albuquerque, N.M. had almost 10% more violent crime, twice the national
increase.

Drugs are infecting other countries. With U.S. neighborhoods overstocked with
cocaine, the scourge is spreading to Europe and the promise of new markets.

The world drug trade is now a vast and frightening $ 500 billion dollar-a- year
business - the subject of an international narcotics conference this week in
London.

The USA is cooperating with other countries to ease the drug disease - like
helping Colombia with its struggles to tame a murderous drug cartel. We need to
do more.

But the real hope for a cure is curbing demand here.

Some people, like the writer across the page, would like you to think it's easy.
He promises to cure both the drug and crime diseases with one magic bullet -
legalization. Take away the punishment, and the crime disappears. Simple. Drug
war won, disease cured.

That's no victory; that's surrender.

Legalizing drugs might help empty our prisons of drug offenders, but it would
fill our hospitals with drug victims. With no laws to discourage drug use, we'd
have scores of new addicts, scores of new overdoses and scores of new
drug-exposed babies.

And the promise that drug-related crime would disappear is an empty one. Drugs
themselves can make people violent. And addicts would still steal to buy drugs.

A society that decides to make it easier to get drugs teaches some confusing
lessons about right and wrong. Like it or not, it says that taking drugs is OK.
It says that abusing the body and altering the mind is a reasonable recreation.

Keeping drugs illegal is obviously not enough to innoculate people against the
drug disease. But it's a crucial part of the cure.

The rest of the treatment calls for a thorough education about the lifetime
costs of drugs.

It calls for teaching people how to make better choices and making sure those
choices are available.

It calls for more and better drug treatment facilities.

It calls for continued law enforcement vigilance.

There are no magic bullets to cure the drug disease. The best medicine for this
problem takes time - and is often the hardest to swallow.

Violent crime rates rising in U.S., FBI says: Murder, assault, robbery

BYLINE: Steven Edwards, CanWest News Service

SECTION: WORLD; Pg. A22

LENGTH: 634  words

DATELINE: NEW YORK


NEW YORK - The United States became a more dangerous place last year compared to
2004, with more murders, robberies and aggravated assaults leading the biggest
rise in the violent crime rate since 2001, the FBI reported yesterday.

The number of murder victims exceeded 16,900 while there were at least 92,837
forcible rapes and almost 420,000 robberies. Among big U.S. cities, Dallas
emerged as the most dangerous, with economically depressed Detroit a close
second, while New York again enjoyed being dubbed the safest.

But experts differed on whether the statistics show the United States to be
significantly more dangerous than Canada, with one leading scholar arguing most
crime rates are similar except for homicide.

"The U.S. is higher in gun crime, but Canada has higher burglary rates, it has
higher theft rates, it has equivalent assault rates: it is a high-crime
society," said Marcus Felson, professor at the School of Criminal Justice of
Rutgers University in Newark, New Jersey.

"Western Canada is a very high-crime society, while eastern Canada is moderate
like New York, but that's partly for the wrong reason, namely it is too cold in
winter to commit much crime."

Statistics Canada will release Canada's 2005 crime statistics next month, but
annually warns against comparing them with the FBI list because the Canadian
roundup considers a greater number of violent offences. The murder rate in the
United States shot up 4.8% last year, marking the highest percentage increase in
15 years. The robbery rate rose 4.5%, but the number of forcible rapes reported
dipped by 1.9%. More than 70,000 people have been murdered in the United States
since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, claimed almost 3,000 lives.

The overall trend bucks a general decline throughout the 1990s, but individual
spikes are explainable. For example, the arrival in Houston of thousands of
people fleeing Hurricane Katrina-ravaged New Orleans -- long known as a high-
crime city -- could have contributed to the 23% rise in the Texas city's murder
count, from 272 to 334.

"When new teenagers show up, they upset the pecking order," said Prof. Felson,
whose latest book, Crime and Nature, explores crime's symbiotic relationships
with society's legal activities.

Rapidly growing Las Vegas saw a 10% increase in its murder rate, from 131 to
144, but continued economic decline accompanied by a 14% rise in the number of
murders in Philadelphia, where there were 377 victims, up from 330.

"Philadelphia has more abandoned property than any city in America, and
Baltimore is second," Prof. Felson said. "So you have whole areas of the city
that are like a war zone. Not only is abandoned property used for crime, but
there is no one living and working there to look after the street."

The now-cooling housing boom and rising property prices meant developers snapped
up abandoned property in other cities. "Redevelopment was most marked in New
York. Times Square was once a generator of crime, but that is no longer the
case," Prof. Felson said.

More than 12,000 law enforcement agencies submitted reports to the FBI, which
will release a more comprehensive review in the fall. In New York, Mayor Michael
Bloomberg credited the continued fall in violent crime to tougher policing and
his drive to get illegal guns off the streets.

But the entire Northeast showed the least marked rise in violent crime,
contrasting sharply with the Midwest, where there was an overall 5.7% increase.

In Canada in 2004 there were 622 murders, representing two for every 100,000
people. Some experts claim Canada's health care system does a better job at
saving lives. "The difference between a homicide and a serious assault is often
just how quickly you can get a person to a hospital," said Ronald Melchers,
criminology professor at the University of Ottawa.

Phila. leads big cities in murder rate;
"It's a disturbing statistic," the police commissioner says. Other cities saw a
rise.

Philadelphia had the highest murder rate among the nation's 10 largest cities
last year, and violent crime and property crime grew at a rate that exceeded the
national average, according to FBI statistics released yesterday.

Philadelphia's 406 murders last year represented a 7.7 percent increase over
2005. The 10 largest cities recorded an increase of 6.9 percent and nationwide
the rate increased 0.3 percent, according to the FBI's preliminary uniform crime
report.

Among the top 10 cities, Philadelphia reported the highest violent-crime rate
last year, up 5.9 percent. Nationwide, violent crime increased 1.3 percent last
year over 2005, according to the FBI's annual survey of 11,723 law enforcement
agencies. Violent crime includes murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault.

"It's a disturbing statistic, we're very concerned about it, and we're going to
do everything we can to reduce it," Police Commissioner Sylvester M. Johnson
said yesterday.

Property crime, which includes motor vehicle theft, burglary and larceny,
decreased 2.9 percent nationwide. In Philadelphia, such thefts increased 3.6
percent.

Other top-10 cities had higher growth rates in violent crime last year - New
York experienced a 10.6 percent increase in murders, and Houston recorded 12.9
percent more murders last year.

But Philadelphians were more likely to be murdered than residents of other
cities whose populations exceed one million people. Philadelphia had a murder
rate of 27.8 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2006, compared with 18.9 in 2002.
Houston, the second-most-murder-prone city in the top 10, had 18.2 murders per
100,000 last year.

The release of the data prompted local officials to renew calls for more
assistance from Harrisburg and Washington. "We need stronger gun laws from the
commonwealth and more support from the federal government," said Joe Grace,
Mayor Street's spokesman.

The statistics show that Philadelphia's peer group is not really other
mega-cities, but other cities with substantial impoverished underclasses -
Atlanta; Baltimore; Washington; Memphis; Oakland, Calif.; Richmond, Va.; St.
Louis; Detroit; and Newark, N.J.

Among 34 cities with populations greater than 500,000, Philadelphia's murder
rate ranked fourth. Detroit, Baltimore and Washington recorded murder rates of
47, 43 and 29 per 100,000 inhabitants last year. Philadelphia also had the
fourth-highest rate of violent crime among cities of a half-million or more,
behind Detroit, Memphis and Baltimore.

U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, who last week proposed legislation that
would increase penalties for some violent crimes and restore mandatory minimum
sentences, said the crime statistics did not reveal nationwide trends. "Rather,
they show local increases in certain communities," he said in Washington last
week.

But some criminologists say the statistics tell a tale of a nation cleaved along
lines of populations - larger jurisdictions that have been on the short end of
federal budget cuts, as well as those cities that have had to divert law
enforcement resources to homeland security.

Violent crime is up in cities with populations larger than 250,000, which have
lost about 10 percent of their law enforcement resources since 2000, said James
Alan Fox, a criminal justice professor at Northeastern University in Boston.

In the rest of the country where police forces have not shrunk, he said, crime
rates are steady. "I know people want their tax cuts, but a few hundred dollars
in extra taxes seems small when you're staring down the barrel of a gun," said
Fox.

Criminologists say the crime is attributable to a complex mix of social and
economic causes - unemployment, a resurgence in gang activity, increased traffic
in illegal guns, reductions in programs for youth development, children growing
up in poverty, and single-parent households.

The challenge, Fox said, is that law enforcement will not be able to respond
quickly to the increase in crime because it takes several years to recruit,
train and deploy new officers to expand a depleted police force.

Grace, the mayor's spokesman, noted that homicides are up across Pennsylvania
since 2000 and called on the legislature to tighten restrictions on gun
purchases. "This is not just a Philadelphia and Pittsburgh problem," he said.

Amherst ranked as 2nd-safest U.S. 'city'

BYLINE: By Anthony Cardinale - NEWS STAFF REPORTER

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A1

LENGTH: 407 words


The Town of Amherst again has been ranked the second-safest "city" in the United
States by Morgan Quitno Press, a Kansas publishing and research company.

Erie County's biggest suburb has ranked first seven times during the past 13
years. In 2005 and '04, it came in third.

This year, Quitno Press compared FBI crime figures for 371 municipalities with
populations above 75,000.

But in the 100,000-499,000 population range, Amherst did come in as the No. 1
safest of 213 communities.

The most dangerous city this year is St. Louis, according to the survey. Only
crimes reported within the city limits were counted in the survey, which omitted
the suburbs. St. Louis has about 330,000 residents; its suburbs, 650,000.

Which raises an interesting question: How can St. Louis, with its crime-ridden
urban ghetto, possibly compete with Amherst, which isn't a "city" at all but an
entirely suburban township?

Is any suburb listed among the most dangerous places in America?

Well, if there were separate listings for suburbs, Amherst would would be the
safest and Compton, Calif., the most dangerous. A residential and industrial
suburb between Los Angeles and Long Beach, Compton was ranked fourth for crime
-- because it has the highest murder rate in the nation.

Another township in Erie County, Cheektowaga, is also on the list, ranking
36th-safest.

The safest place in America, according to Morgan Quitno, is Brick Township, N.J.
After Amherst come Mission Viejo, Calif.; Newton, Mass. (a suburb of Boston);
Troy, Mich.; and Colonie, N.Y. Coming in ninth is Greece, N.Y. (a suburb of
Rochester).

Buffalo, meanwhile, is the 340th-safest -- not far from the worst 10. Rochester
is 334th-safest and Syracuse, 305th. At the bottom is St. Louis, the
371st-"safest" of the 371 places surveyed.

New York City, by the way, came in 145th.

The survey lists 18 "missing cities" of 75,000 or more people for which valid
figures were not available. The list runs from Augusta, Ga., to Wichita, Kan.,
with New Orleans standing out as a place where confusion in crime reporting
might be understandable.

In addition, seven cities in Illinois -- including Chicago -- were left out of
the survey because their rape data didn't meet FBI standards.

FBI data on murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary and motor
vehicle theft indicated a rise in crime during 2005. Violent crime rose by 2.3
percent, but property crime fell by 1.5 percent.

High crime rate has been issue for years

BOSTON -- Lt. Gov. Kerry Healey is right in that crime in Massachusetts has gone
down during the past four years while she and Gov. Mitt Romney served at the
helm.

What the Republican didn't mention at Thursday's gubernatorial debate is that
Massachusetts has had the highest crime rate in New England for the past 44
years, with the exception of 1967 and 1970 when Rhode Island's crime rate was
slightly higher.

It's true that the number of violent crimes has declined since Healey took
office in 2002. That year, the rate of crime in Massachusetts per 100,000 people
was 484.9, according to statistics from the U.S. Bureau of Justice. That figure
sank to 473.1 in 2003, and to 458.8 in 2004, the latest numbers available.

Despite that downward trend, Massachusetts' crime rate continues to be
significantly higher than the rest of New England. In 2004, New Hampshire's
crime rate was 167, compared to Massachusetts' 458.8. Maine's crime rate was
103.5; Vermont's was 112; Connecticut's was 286.3; and Rhode Island's was 247.4.

Since 1960, Massachusetts has had a dramatically higher crime rate than the rest
of the New England states. In 1993, its crime rate was 804.9: nearly 350 crimes
per 100,000 people higher than the state with the next highest rate,
Connecticut.

Democrat Deval Patrick noted that Massachusetts' crime rate is the highest in
New England at Thursday night's debate, but his spokesman Richard Chacon said
afterward that the campaign did not realize Massachusetts' crime rate has been
the highest in New England for decades.

The Patrick campaign has been conducting its own survey on crime prevention, and
has called 14 communities in the last few months to talk with police chiefs
about how effective the Romney/Healey administration's policies and spending
have been on crime prevention.

So far, Chacon said, the campaign estimates between 500 and 700 cops have been
taken off the streets during the Romney/Healey administration's term, due to
cuts in local aid.

"That's not an insignificant number and probably the reason why so many
residents don't feel as safe as Kerry Healey thinks they are," Chacon said.

The Healey campaign, however, has questioned the reliability of the Patrick
camp's survey and estimates regarding cuts to police officers.

Healey campaign spokeswoman Amy Lambiaso, speaking about Patrick, said "if we
have a governor who's more worried about getting convicted cop killers off death
row and brutal rapists released from prison... the crime rate has nowhere to go
but up."

POLICE CITE DECLINE IN E. ST. LOUIS GANGS

BYLINE: Robert Kelly Of The Post-Dispatch Staff

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 9A

LENGTH: 694 words


East St. Louis had the highest violent crime rate of any Metro East community,
according to FBI crime statistics. But the situation there isn't as bad as the
figures suggest, authorities say.

The murder rate has been declining recently, and police say they have put a dent
in gang warfare and other crimes.

"Police presence is the only answer to gang violence and gang presence," said
U.S. Marshal Terry Delaney of Southern Illinois. He formerly headed a gang
crimes unit for the Illinois State Police that targeted East St. Louis street
gangs.

The unit, he said, succeeded in the late 1980s in scattering members of the
Disciples, Vice Lords and Metros gangs and breaking up any centralized authority
they had. Since then, Delaney said, regular State Police patrols and the East
St. Louis police's own Delta unit have helped neutralize the gangs.

Even so, work remains to be done, he said.

The drug trade helped boost East St. Louis' violent crime rate to 52.6 for every
1,000 residents in 1993 and 1994, the two years covered in the FBI report.

The Post-Dispatch analyzed FBI crime statistics compiled by 27 law enforcement
agencies in St. Clair County, 21 in Madison County and 3 in Monroe County for
the years 1993 and 1994.

Among the findings:

* East St. Louis reported 4,043 violent crimes for the two years. It was the
highest violent crime rate of all reporting Metro East communities.

* South Roxana, with about 2,000 residents, and Lenzburg, with just 513,
reported no violent crimes during the two years.

* The average rates of violent crime - including murders, rapes, armed robberies
and felony assaults - for the two years were 12.04 crimes for each 1,000
residents of St. Clair County; 3.74 for each 1,000 residents of Madison County;
and .097 for each 1,000 residents of Monroe County.

Hugh Barlow is a criminologist who is chairman of the sociology department at
Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville. He said fear of violent crime
anywhere in the Metro East area is almost always irrational. He charged that
such fear is fostered by local media.

"Most crime isn't violent," Barlow said. "It's by far the minority of crime, but
we're obsessed with violent crime."

He said statistics kept by the FBI show that violent crime is down throughout
most of the Midwest, including the St. Louis area.

Because of poverty, public perception and the breakdown of families, crime gets
far more publicity in a place like East St. Louis than in a wealthy community
like Ladue, Barlow said.

Even communities that aren't particularly rich can have low crime rates when
residents watch out for each other and report suspicious activities to police.

A case in point is working-class Dupo, with the second-lowest violent crime rate
among St. Clair County communities for 1993-94.

Sgt. Randy Bolle of Dupo police attributes the town's low percentage of violent
crime to the high visibility of the police department. "Our guys are on the
street constantly, and it makes a big difference," he said.

He added that Dupo's small size - it has about 3,300 residents - works to the
advantage of police.

Helping the police also is a key in impoverished towns with higher violent crime
percentages like Venice in Madison County, said Venice Police Chief James
Bennett and Lois Wilson, a resident who's been involved in Neighborhood Watch
anti-crime programs in Venice.

Bennett said his department has been increasing patrols outside local schools to
try to keep gangs from gaining a foothold.

Wilson said she was distressed that the local Neighborhood Watch program had
grown inactive recently due to a shortage of police officers to work with
residents on the program.

* In Madison County, arrests by Illinois State Police groups were not included
because there was no territory to assign those arrests to.

* In St. Clair County, arrests made by the Metro East auto theft task force of
the state police were not included for the same reason.

* Also in St. Clair County, arrests made by two railroad police forces were not
counted.

* In Missouri and in Illinois, arrests made by campus police were not included.

REDS Manager: Ray Knight. 1995 Finish: 85-59, first place. Welcome Aboard: C Joe
Oliver, 3B Chris Sabo, OF Vince Coleman, OF Eric Davis, OF Mike Kelly, OF Curtis
Goodwin. The Arms: Pete Schourek and John Smiley are a splendid place to start
in the rotation. The club sure could use a speedy recovery for Jose Rijo from
elbow surgery. Middle relief is filled with landmines. The Bats: RF Reggie
Sanders, SS Barry Larkin and a healthy 1B Hal Morris would make any lineup
potent. But this one could use one more strong year from LF Vince Coleman in the
leadoff spot. Uh-Oh: Jeff Brantley saved 28 games last season and is as
dependable as closer as you'll find. But he'll miss a month with a foot injury,
turning Hector Carrasco into a closer and upsetting the shaky bullpen. Psst: A
team seemingly always looking for a smaller payroll, the Reds could look to deal
Smiley or P Mark Portugal near the stretch even if the team is hunting for the
playoffs. Best Guess: They'll be in one of the tightest races in years. But
they'll finish third. (8) Graphic Chart - HOUSTON ASTROS Manager: Terry Collins.
1995 Finish: 76-68, second place. Welcome Aboard: 3B Sean Berry. The Arms: They
will be their ticket to the postseason or out of town. A combination of veterans
who have disappointed (Doug Drabek, Greg Swindell), a possibility whose time is
almost up (Darryl Kile) and youngsters on the verge (Shane Reynolds, Mike
Hampton, Billy Wagner). The Bats: No NL team has a more dangerous trio than 2B
Craig Biggio, 1B Jeff Bagwell and OF Derek Bell. CF Brian Hunter could add to it
from the leadoff spot. Powerful showings from Berry and C Rick Wilkins would
relieve some pressure on the pitchers. Uh-Oh: P John Hudek made the all-star
squad as a rookie closer last year. But he had surgery for a blood clot in his
pitching arm and will open the season on the disabled list. Psst: Word in Astros
spring camp was that Kile, with a 4-12 record last season, has regained the
control that made him one of the league's most promising prospects a couple of
years ago. Best Guess: They will avoid devastating injuries, which enables them
to finish first. (9) Graphic Chart - CHICAGO CUBS Manager: Jim Riggleman. 1995
Finish: 73-71, third place. Welcome Aboard: 2B Ryne Sandberg, 3B Dave Magadan, P
Rob Dibble, P Doug Jones, P Duane Ward. The Arms: The young rotation actually is
a strength - odd for a Cubs team, eh? They had the NL's fourth-best earned-run
average in 1995 behind Jaime Navarro and Frank Castillo. Steve Trachsel needs to
join their success. More troublesome is the risk that Doug Jones, Duane Ward or
Rob Dibble can stabilize the bullpen. The Bats: If they'd push back the fences
and replace Wrigley Field's grass with artificial turf, the lineup might feel
more comfortable. OF Sammy Sosa can hit it out of any park. 1B Mark Grace and OF
Brian McRae can move a rally along. But will 2B Ryne Sandberg make enough
difference? Uh-Oh: Before Sandberg, 36, retired from baseball 22 months ago, he
had hit only 14 homers in his previous 680 at-bats. Psst: Fans in Chicago once
worried that former first-round pick Brooks Kieschnick might have overeaten his
big-league chances. He trimmed the criticism with 23 homers and a .295 batting
average in Class AAA last season. If he can win the LF job, he could be the
league's best rookie. Best Guess: An offense too weak to finish higher than
fourth. (10) Graphic Chart - ST. LOUIS CARDINALS Manager: Tony La Russa. 1995
Finish: 62-81, fourth place. Welcome Aboard: La Russa, 2B Mike Gallego, SS Royce
Clayton, 3B Gary Gaetti, OF Ron Gant, OF Willie McGee, P Andy Benes, P Todd
Stottlemyre, P Dennis Eckersley. The Arms: Potentially, fearsome. Andy Benes and
Todd Stottlemyre are in their prime. Alan Benes is the league's No. 1 pitching
prospect. Injuries to other starters could mean a slow start. And it will put
greater emphasis on a veteran bullpen. The Bats: Ron Gant, Ray Lankford and
Brian Jordan pose one of the game's best outfields. 3B Gary Gaetti should add
some punch, and 1B John Mabry should hit even better with less pressure.
However, the Cards can least afford to lose C Tom Pagnozzi, who will help
produce runs if healthy. Uh-Oh: P Dennis Eckersley hasn't had an ERA below 4.00
since 1992. Psst: The Cardinals draft third this June, their highest selection
spot ever. Clemson P Kris Benson and Wichita State P Braden Looper will be
possibilities. Best Guess: Strong enough to win a wild-card and perhaps reach
the League Championship Series. But they'll finish second in a fun Central race.
(11) Graphic Chart - PITTSBURGH PIRATES Manager: Jim Leyland. 1995 Finish:
58-86, fifth place. Welcome Aboard: 3B Charlie Hayes, OF Mike Kingery, P Zane
Smith The Arms: The worst staff in the league. If not for starter Denny Neagle
and closer Dan Miceli, the worst in the big leagues. What they lack in
experience they make up for with a lack of promise. The Bats: OF Orlando Merced,
SS Jay Bell, OF Al Martin, 1B Jeff King, 2B Carlos Garcia - plenty of nice
dressing. But where's the meat? Uh-Oh: Miceli saved 21 games last season, not
bad for a team that won only 58. But he allowed 89 baserunners in 58 innings.
Psst: Rookie C Jason Kendall, excellent defensively, could jump all the way from
Class AA into the starting lineup after driving in 71 runs last season. Best
Guess: Fifth place, only because there aren't six in the division.

Chico one of safest places to live, insurance firm says

BYLINE: BREA JONES - Staff Intern

SECTION: LOCAL

LENGTH: 422 words


Chico is a secure place to live according to a report that ranks Chico and the
surrounding area as the nation's 20th most-secure midsized city.

The Chico-Paradise metro area -- Butte County -- was only California midsized
city to make the top 20 list, released Wednesday by Farmers Insurance.
Sacramento was ranked No. 7 for large metro areas, but no other California
cities made the top 20 rankings out of 331 U.S. areas.

The ranking was based on crime statistics, extreme weather, risk of natural
disasters and job loss numbers.

Chico City Manager Tom Lando said Chico has been on lists of best small towns in
which to live, but not in terms of safety.

"I think it's an accurate reflection of our community," he said.

The midsize ranking would compare Chico to places like Redding, Shasta and
Modesto, Lando said. And of those, Lando said Chico is the most desirable to
live in.

Chico Police Chief Bruce Hagerty agrees.

"One of the reasons why I live in Chico and will stay in Chico is that Chico's a
great place to live and raise your kids," he said.

The company that compiled the data for Farmers Insurance, Sperling's BestPlaces,
lists Chico's violent crime as 13 percent below the national average with 386.5
incidents per 100,000 people, according to www.bestplaces.net.

However, the property crime listing is 12 percent above the national average
with 4,642.7 incidents per 100,000 people.

Hagerty said the disparity is because narcotics and drug use drives property
crime.

Community members can help reduce property crime by being aware of their
surroundings, locking their cars and not leaving valuables on car seats even
when locked, he said.

"If people who do property crimes have an opportunity, they'll take it," Hagerty
said.

But Hagerty said crime in Chico is not as high as many other cities.

"We do not have a violent city," Hagerty said. "There are acts of violence that
occur on occasion, but Chico is not a violent city."

SOUTHWEST JOURNAL;
A MUSEUM OUTLASTING BAD TIMES

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to the New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Jan. 11


In tough times even cowboys get the blues. But events seem to be heading toward
a happy ending at the National Cowboy Hall of Fame, scene of one of Oklahoma's
longest-running soap operas.

Officials say they have raised $7 million toward a $10 million goal that will
insure the future in Oklahoma City of an institution that has been racked by
financial problems and internal feuding for much of the past two years. For a
time, there was speculation that the museum, which includes a Western art
collection worth an estimated $35 million, might even have to leave town.

''The survival of this hall is a double or triple tribute to the people of
Oklahoma,'' said Roy Edwards Sr., treasurer of the institution, which opened in
1965. ''Oklahoma is in as bad a situation as I have experienced. This has not
been an easy task.'' The Cowboy Hall of Fame's collection ranges from classic
Western art, including 40 Frederick Remington paintings, to such pop artifacts
as the rifle John Wayne used in the film ''Stagecoach'' or a fiddle owned by the
Western swing pioneer Bob Wills.

The hall was established by Western art and culture enthusiasts from 17 Western
states, and in true wildcatter fashion, it depended on a lot of borrowed money.
Financial problems and philosophical differences finally boiled over in 1985
when the hall's longtime curator was ousted, feuding factions battled for
control, and the hall was placed in receivership.

Most differences were patched up last summer, and now officials say the hall has
raised $6 million in Oklahoma and $1 million from other states in the effort to
pay off debts. ''I think the day will be coming when we will be known for our
programs and not for our controversy,'' said the museum's new director, B. Byron
Price.

Bad Guys Thriving, Too

Quick. Which of the nation's 10 largest cities has the highest crime rate? No,
not New York or Chicago. Not Detroit or Houston.

For the first six months of 1986, that dubious honor went to Dallas, usually
better known for big dollars than for big crime. It reported 73 crimes per 1,000
residents, as against 63 per thousand in Detroit, the runner-up. New York's rate
was 42.

The crime rate for the year was up 19 percent in Dallas.

''I can't recall an increase like that since about 1973, and then there was a
change in the reporting system and there was a big jump because of the change,''
said Bob Shaw, a spokesman for the Dallas police. ''Most of it now, 87 percent,
is property crime. Property crime is eating us alive.'' Mr. Shaw said increasing
drug traffic, the slowing economy, and the continuing early release of prisoners
from Texas's overcrowded prisons were all contributing to the crime increase.
The situation is even worse in neighboring Fort Worth, where crime rose 22
percent last year.

The bad news on crime has been good news for companies selling security systems,
which say they've seen a dramatic increase in business.

And it is being watched with much interest in Houston, where people often think
Dallas is a bit smug about its insulation from the state's economic problems.
The Houston Post, which seldom reports from Dallas, rushed to follow The Dallas
Times Herald's report on the crime rate with a huge front-page spread headlined
''Crime - The Big C in Big D.''

Still, Mr. Shaw said the crime surge said something about Dallas's affluence as
well as its problems.

''It's like Willie Sutton used to say,'' Mr. Shaw said. ''They asked him why he
robbed banks and he said he did it because that's where the money is.''

And Voters Are Unswayed

One of the continuing electoral rituals in Texas is the wet-dry election, a
referendum on whether a town will allow the sale of alcohol.

There seems to be one going on most of the time somewhere in the state,
invariably pitting a group of business people and promoters touting the economic
virtues of liquor sales against churches pointing to moral and spiritual costs.

The recent election in the tiny West Texas town of Novice, population 201, had
those basic elements with one twist. There was just one active proponent, Martha
Smith, whose Novice Grocery and Cattle Company is the only grocery store in
town.

So the voters all saw the election as a simple question: ''Should Martha be able
to sell beer and wine?''

She argued that times were so tough because of the oil industry downturn that
she couldn't survive in business without selling alcohol. That would leave the
town's elderly residents with no place to shop, she said.

But the town's three churches, Baptist, Church of Christ and Methodist, ran a
unified campaign against her and when the votes were counted, she had been
crushed, 53 to 41.

Mrs. Smith says she might try again, but no one else seems to think it would be
worth the effort.

''The girl was raised here and went to school with my children,'' said David
Coffman, the Church of Christ minister. ''I thought I might write her a letter
and tell her the way people improve their business is to have the Lord on their
side.''

Even her own brother, Gerald Wilson, saying ''alcohol is a deterrent to
society,'' voted against her. ''But that has nothing to do with my relationship
with Martha,'' he said.

VIOLENT CRIMES ESCALATE FOR SECOND STRAIGHT YEAR IN U.S.

BYLINE: Reuters

SECTION: WORLD; World Report; Pg. A11

LENGTH: 199  words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON


WASHINGTON -More murders and robberies in 2006 sent U.S. violent crimes higher
for the second straight year, the Federal Bureau of Investigation said
yesterday, with the increase blamed on gangs, youth violence, gun crimes and
fewer police on beats. The agency reported the number of violent crimes
nationwide went up by 1.3% last year, after a 2.3% increase in 2005. That had
been the first rise in four years and the biggest percentage gain in 15 years.
The report showed that murders in big cities jumped last year by 6.7%, while
robberies, an important indicator of crime trends, increased 6% nationwide.
Cities with big increases in the number of murders included Orlando and Miami,
Fla.; Oakland and San Diego, Calif.; Phoenix, Ariz.; Corpus Christi, Tex.; Grand
Rapids, Mich.; Reno, Nev.; and Little Rock, Ark. Even though the higher violent
crime numbers had been expected, they still represented bad news for Alberto
Gonzales, the U.S. Attorney General, who has made violent crime a top priority.
"Any increase is still of concern and the reason why the Attorney General has
acted to expand federal efforts to combat violent crime," said Brian Roehrkasse,
a Justice Department spokesman.

FBI: Violent crime down in 2013

BYLINE: From news services

SECTION: NATIONAL

LENGTH: 389 words


WASHINGTON -- The FBI says the number of violent crimes reported to law
enforcement last year dropped by 4.4 percent from 2012.

The crime statistics released Monday by the FBI also showed a longer-term
decline, over the past five years, in both violent crime and property crime.

The report is based on voluntarily reported statistics from more than 18,000 law
enforcement agencies. It covers crimes including murder, rape, robbery and
aggravated assault.

The report says the number of violent crimes reported to law enforcement last
year was roughly 1.16 million, down significantly from the 2012 estimate.

Attorney General Eric Holder called the drop in violent crime a "remarkable
achievement" that's part of a continuing trend.

Detroit had the highest homicide rate among the nation's larger cities in 2013.

According to the FBI, Detroit had 316 homicides in 2013 and a population of
699,889, putting the city's rate at about 45 homicides per 100,000 residents --
more than any other city in the nation with 100,000 or more residents.

According to the FBI, Detroit was followed by:

-- New Orleans, which had a rate of about 41 homicides per 100,000 residents

-- Newark, N.J., about 40 homicides per 100,000 residents

-- St. Louis, about 38 homicides per 100,000 residents

-- Baltimore, about 37 homicides per 100,000 residents

The nation's largest cities -- New York, Los Angeles and Chicago -- had much
lower homicide rates, according to FBI statistics.

New York, with a population of more than 8 million, saw 4 homicides per 100,000
residents; Los Angeles, with nearly 3.9 million residents, had roughly 7
homicides per 100,000 residents; and Chicago, which had the highest number of
murders in 2013, with 414, had more than 2.7 million residents and a rate of
about 15 homicides per 100,000 residents.

Along with a high homicide rate, Detroit also had the highest violent crime rate
among large cities, followed by Oakland, Calif., and Memphis, Tenn., according
to the FBI.

In 2012, Flint, Mich., had the highest homicide rate for large cities across the
country, with roughly 63 per 100,000 residents. That year the city had just over
100,000 residents. In 2013, the city's population dropped below 100,000 and
there were 48 homicides, according to the FBI.

'Young and the Restless' // Crime in 1992 more violent

BYLINE: Bruce Frankel; Dennis Cauchon

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 7A

LENGTH: 578 words


Criminals were younger and crimes more confrontational in 1992.

Those are some of the trends that can be drawn from early police statistics for
1992.

It's too early to measure the overall crime rate precisely, but indications are
that auto theft was up, violent crimes remained high and burglaries were down.

''We're seeing less burglaries and petty theft, and more serious crimes,'' says
Fred Taylor, director of the Miami Dade police.

Carjackings - the notorious crime of 1992 - symbolize the change in the nature
of crime.

''Carjackings are a fad crime that won't last,'' says criminologist James Fox.
''But what's disturbing is how it fits the pattern we're seeing of more ruthless
and random crimes.''

In the past, criminals tried to avoid confrontation. ''The last thing a burglar
or auto thief wanted was to meet somebody,'' Fox says.

But today's criminal tends to be younger and in search of action as much as
loot. Fox expects more youth crime in the next five years as a demographic surge
in the youth population occurs. ''I call them 'The Young and the Ruthless,' ''
he says.

The reasons for rising or falling crime varies by city:

- In Seattle, murders are up 21%. The city had several multiple murders among
family members.

- In Buffalo, murders are up 57%.  The problem is largely drug-related. ''A
great many of these homicides were done behind closed doors, and the individuals
killed were targeted. We don't have individuals spraying the streets of Buffalo
with gunfire,'' says Capt. Charles Fieramusca, chief of homicide.

- Miami enjoyed a big drop in crime thanks to Hurricane Andrew. ''People were
too busy putting their lives back together'' to commit murder and mayhem, Taylor
says. But the 11 murders Christmas week may indicate a return to old form, he
says.

Easy access to guns, especially among the young, is viewed as a major problem.
In a typical killing, Terrel Jackson, 12, of Bridgeport, Conn., was shot to
death last June by a teen-ager with a semi-automatic pistol.

Most criminologists say the current ''lock 'em up'' strategy, which has swelled
the prison population from 513,000 in 1980 to 1.3 million, hasn't helped.
''Investing in corrections officers rather than second-grade teachers won't
lower crime in the long term,'' Fox says.

Tracking major crimes

How reports of serious crimes rose or fell in selected cities across the USA in
the first 11 months of 1992, compared with the first 11 months of 1991:

 Aggravated
City               Murder       Rape       assault        Burglary
Buffalo             +57%      +11%          -2%              -1%

OUR INCREDIBLE SHRINKING CRIME RATE

BYLINE: By DAVID SALTONSTALL DAILY NEWS CITY HALL BUREAU CHIEF

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3

LENGTH: 389 words


If you think crime is bad in New York, then stay the heck out of Port St. Lucie,
Fla.

The sleepy Florida burg - best known as spring training grounds for the Mets -
actually had a higher crime rate last year than New York, new FBI data show.

So did Dallas, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and every other city among the nation's
10 most populous. New York ranked 10th on that list - with a crime rate 30%
lower than ninth-place San Diego.

"The news for New York City is spectacular," Mayor Bloomberg said in trumpeting
the figures yesterday at City Hall.

The FBI crime stats showed major crimes - murder, rape, robbery, aggravated
assault, burglary, car theft, larceny and arson - dropped 5.8% in the city in
2003.

Crime was down in every category except murder, which inched up from 587
killings in 2002 to 597 in 2003, the FBI reported.

The decline placed New York 211th on the list of 230 American cities with a
population over 100,000. That was lower down the list - and lower is better on
this list - than such relative cow towns as Waco, Tex. (42nd); Omaha (75th);
Wichita, Kan. (98th); Rancho Cucamonga, Calif. (194th), and Port St. Lucie
(210th).

St. Louis has the dubious distinction of being the most dangerous city in the
country, with a per-capita crime rate nearly five times higher than New York's,
the data showed.

Bloomberg and Police Commissioner Ray Kelly credited Operation Impact - which
floods 23 of the city's highest-crime areas with new recruits - for driving the
decline.

The drop is so big, they added, that 50% of the nation's crime decrease since
2001 can be credited to New York's decline, which began in 1990 under Mayor
David Dinkins and picked up steam around 1994 under Mayor Rudy Giuliani.

"But if there is one single reason for the reduction in crime, it is the quality
and dedication of New York City police officers," Kelly said. "They are doing
just phenomenal work."

Some union chiefs have suggested the city's numbers are being driven
artificially low by commanders who - under pressure to keep the trend going -
reclassify felonies to lesser crimes.

"C'mon," said a visibly angry Bloomberg when asked about the allegations. "These
are FBI numbers. Do you really think somebody is going to convince the FBI to
falsify data? It is just not the case."

"The truth of the matter," he said, " is that this city gets safer."

Armed and dangerous: A firearms registry won't stop criminals from terrorizing
people, but a minimum sentence of 10 years for crimes committed using a gun
will.

DATELINE: TORONTO

TORONTO - Absent in the public debate over how to reduce gun-related crimes is a
serious consideration of the most sensible remedy: stiffer penalties.

When the Ontario attorney general recently endorsed a Criminal Code amendment
that would create a 10-year mandatory minimum for armed robbery, armed assault
and other crimes committed using a firearm, former Ontario Superior Court judge
David Humphrey bristled, saying the proposal would accomplish nothing.

"I'm very much against minimum penalties put forward by politicians for
political reasons, as well as to address a social concern," he said. (Odd that.
Don't all laws, by definition, address a social concern?) Prominent criminal
defence lawyer Paul Calarco dismissed David Young's idea as "ridiculous"
political posturing.

But when one examines other jurisdictions that have experimented with stricter
sentences for gun crimes, such peremptory criticisms melt away. In a number of
cities in the United States -- Detroit, Tampa, Jacksonville, Miami, Pittsburg,
Philadelphia -- the number of homicides dropped significantly after the
introduction of higher mandatory sentencing laws.

As a general proposition, greater penalties for heinous acts deter more crimes
than do lesser penalties (all else being equal). After the passage of stronger
sentences in California's Proposition 8 in 1982, there was a decrease in crimes
covered by the amendment, but not for other crimes. Proposition 8 raised
sentences by up to five years for criminals with previous convictions such as
homicide, rape, robbery and residential burglary. But it did not cover similar
crimes such as larceny, auto theft and assault without a firearm.

In the two years before the law passed, all of the crimes it covered were
climbing -- as were most of the similar crimes that it didn't address. In the
years just after the law passed, all covered crimes plummeted, down 14 per cent
on average, versus a three-per-cent drop for the uncovered ones. By 1985,
covered crimes were down by as much as 20 per cent, compared with an average
4.6-per-cent increase in similar, uncovered crimes.

In Richmond, Virginia, a 1997 initiative ("Project Exile") that set a five-year
mandatory minimum for gun crimes helped reduce homicides in that city by more
than 50 per cent -- from 140 at its inception to 69 in 2001. A recent Brookings
Institution study has questioned whether this measure was the exclusive reason
for the drop in homicides, but it seems reasonable that taking violent thugs off
the street for long periods of time helped chop crime rates.

Yet former Ontario judge David Humphrey has argued -- rightly -- that sterner
penalties for gun crimes won't stop hoodlums from buying firearms. "We live next
to a cesspool of guns in the U.S. and, inevitably, they are going to come here,"
he told reporters earlier this year. "So what is the point of sending a lot of
people to jail (in an effort) to prevent a thug from going out and getting a gun
in one hour, which he can do?" he asked.

That our society is awash in guns only underscores the weakness of regulatory
schemes -- such as a gun registry. Since there are so many illegal guns already
in circulation, simply raising the costs of acquiring weapons -- by inspiring
crooks to invest more creativity in thwarting regulations -- will not stop such
criminals from arming themselves.

It therefore makes sense to prosecute harshly those criminals who wield guns.
This approach should demand a mandatory minimum of 10 years in prison for anyone
caught using a gun during the commission of a crime. No exceptions, not even for
first-time offenders. Anything less would make a mockery of the law and might,
as is already the case, tempt prosecutors to drop or plea-bargain away the gun
charge and focus on the underlying charge of drug possession or robbery in order
to ease the courtroom backlog.

So obsessed, in fact, are Crown attorneys and criminal defence lawyers with
reducing this courtroom backlog that they often fail to see the larger picture.
The gun registry's $1 billion cost could have paid for enough new court space,
computers and judges' salaries to wipe out the mess of criminal trial delays in
Ontario's courts -- which Roy McMurtry, the province's chief justice, recently
described as the worst in the English-speaking world.

And yet, many lawyers balk at the prospect of mandatory 10-year sentences for
gun crimes for fear of even greater backlogs. Here's their argument: An accused
will opt for more trials and more complex, constitutional arguments if he's
worried about getting hauled off to prison for a decade. But this concern seems
especially misplaced among lawyers -- whose overriding concern should not be to
hustle their clients into pleading guilty.

Focusing on tougher punitive measures for gun crimes is good policy because it
serves the cause of justice; it targets violent criminal offenders, not
law-abiding gun owners. A mandatory minimum of 10 years would be especially
effective since it communicates to would-be criminals that gun-related offences
will evoke firm and consistent punishment.

Toronto office.

Crime rising after 10-year drop, FBI says

BYLINE: DANIELLA AIRD

SOURCE: Cox Washington Bureau

SECTION: News; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 605 words


Washington --- Serious crime in the United States rose last year for the first
time since 1991, but remains well below previous levels, the FBI reported
Monday.

The total of 11.8 million crimes was 2.1 percent higher than the number reported
in 2000, according to the annual report released by the FBI's Uniform Crime
Reporting Program.

But that was 10.2 percent lower than the number reported in 1997, and 18 percent
lower than in 1991.

"This is the first uptick in crime we've seen in a while, and that's an issue of
concern," said Alfred Blumstein, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University's
Heinz School of Public Policy and Management in Pittsburgh.

Blumstein said the increase may be linked to the weakened economy.

"A lot of young people coming out of school don't have the skills to compete in
such a tough market, so they turn to crime," he said. "Without jobs, they don't
have an incentive to conform."

Blumstein said crime rates also may have risen because the attention of law
enforcement agencies has been "diverted" to threats of domestic terrorism.

Homicides and rapes in Atlanta were up for 2001, but most major crimes
decreased. Homicides rose 7.5 percent to 144, while rapes were up 32 percent to
367. Atlanta's number of homicides was higher than other cities of similar size
such as Fresno, Calif. (40) and Albuquerque, N.M. (43), but lower than New
Orleans (213).

Sgt. John Quigley, spokesman for the Atlanta Police Department, said the number
of homicides in 2000 was the lowest since 1966 and "to expect 1966 levels every
year is not fair," considering that Atlanta's population is increasing. He said
the increase in rapes was caused by a carryover of rapes that should have been
reported in 2000.

The way crime is reported to state authorities and the FBI has colored how the
Uniform Crime Statistics are viewed.

In February 2001, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that for two years,
Atlanta police detectives placed some sex crime reports in a secret file because
they thought the victims either were lying about being raped or gave police a
false name. An audit at the time turned up 34 reports that were misfiled. As a
result, those 34 reports were not part of the city's overall crime count for
parts of 1999 and 2000 and the first month of 2001.

The FBI's nationwide findings are based on offenses reported by nearly 17,000
law enforcement agencies. The report tallies four violent crimes --- homicide,
rape, robbery and aggravated assault --- and three property crimes --- burglary,
larceny and motor vehicle theft.

Of the seven crimes, only the number of aggravated assaults fell.

For each crime category, the FBI reported the number of crimes in 2001, the
percentage increase from 2000, the rate of crimes per 100,000 people in 2001 and
the percentage change in that rate from 2000:

* Homicide: 15,980, up 2.5 percent, 5.6 per 100,000 people, up 1.3 percent.

* Robbery: 422,921, up 3.7 percent, 148.5 per 100,000 people, up 2.4 percent.

* Aggravated assault: 907,219, down 0.5 percent, 318.5 per 100,000 people, down
1.7 percent.

* Rape: 90,491, up 0.3 percent, 62.2 per 100,000 people, down 0.8 percent.

* Burglary: 2.1 million, up 2.9 percent, 740.8 per 100,000 people, up 1.6
percent.

* Larceny: 7.0 million, up 1.5 percent, 2,484.6 per 100,000 people, up 0.3
percent.

* Auto theft: 1.2 million, up 5.7 percent, 430.6 per 100,000 people, up 4.5
percent.

The FBI did not include deaths from the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

HIGHLIGHT:  USA Nets topper plans to make Crime net pay


NEW YORK --- Barry Diller plans to give Court TV a run for its money with a
digital network called Crime.

As part of his blueprint, Diller, chairman of USA Networks, which owns USA, Sci
Fi Channel, Trio and Newsworld Intl., has bought the Web site Crime.com run by
John Langley, creator of "Cops" and co-founder of the Crime network. "Cops" is
in its 12th season on Fox.

The net, to kick off later this year on a date to be determined, will include
original series that provide, for example, a daily inside look at how cops
investigate crime scenes and a weekly talkshow about crime and its effect on
society, featuring "defense attorneys, law-enforcement officers, crime victims,
convicted criminals, filmmakers, writers and outspoken activists," according to
the network.

Besides the original series, USA will funnel theatrical pics from its library of
acquired titles, including "Carlito's Way," "Arlington Road," "2 Days in the
Valley," "Dead Man Walking" and "Con Air." The web would also buy reruns of
older fictional crime series to fill out some of its schedule.

"I'm convinced that the rollout of digital boxes is inevitable," said Stephen
Chao, prexy of USA Cable. Chao declined to talk about how much money USA plans
to spend on Crime, saying only that the network's expenditures will depend on
how fast cable operators are able to get the digital boxes into people's homes.

Henry Schleiff, chairman and CEO of Court TV, said he's flattered that USA Cable
is creating Crime, because "it proves that there's strong appeal to the genre
covered by crime and justice programming."

If the public continues to resist the digital boxes, however, Crime would likely
cut back on its plans to produce firstrun programming because the network would
reach such a small fraction of cable homes that advertisers would have minimal
interest in buying spots on the schedule.

Gaveler net a hit

Court TV gets into 55 million homes and is considered one of cable's major
success stories of the past two years.

But Chao said crime shows have proved their popularity, not just on Court TV but
all over the dial, both on the broadcast networks and on cable networks such as
Discovery and A&E.

Doug Lee, CEO of Crime.com, will serve as general manager of the Crime channel.
Crime is also under the auspices of Patrick Vien, president of emerging networks
for USA Cable.

New York Crime Statistics vs. Reality

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET

SECTION: Section 1; Page 39; Column 1; Metropolitan Desk

LENGTH: 1216 words


Seattle is a more dangerous place to live than New York City. So are Memphis,
Jacksonville, Fla., and Columbus, Ohio.

At least that is what New York City's analysis of Federal statistics shows.
Which is as good a reason as any to be suspicious of crime statistics.

In fact, Seattle, many experts say, is safer than New York City. And in their
view the gap between the numerical portrait of crime and the gritty reality of
the street says a lot about the flaws and value of Federal crime statistics --
the same statistics that Police Commissioner Lee P. Brown and Mayor David N.
Dinkins have repeatedly used this year to show that they are beginning to win
the war on crime.

"I don't think those statistics are of much value," said George Kelling, a
professor of criminal justice at Northeastern University whom city police
officials credit with shaping their thinking on community policing. As police
departments across the country turn to community policing tactics, he said, they
are discovering that the statistics are of no use at all in measuring their
success.

Plan to Measure Feelings

Because of the limitations of the Federal numbers, the New York City Police
Department plans to create a citywide system next year to measure how citizens
feel about crime, a system that may have the effect of enforcing Commissioner
Brown's community policing goals long after he leaves the force on Sept. 1.

"We want to measure fear," said Inspector Michael A. Julian, commander of the
special projects office of the department's Office of Management and Planning,
who helped design the system. "We can no longer say that crime is going up or
down, or the police are doing a good job, based on crime statistics. That
doesn't float anymore."

But the police will still use the Federal statistics to get as complete a
picture of crime as possible, Inspector Julian said. Even critics of the
statistics said they can be useful as a rough tool to allocate patrol officers.

One reason for the gap between numbers and reality is that the Federal
statistics are based on reported, rather than actual, crime. Seattle's higher
rate may mean only that its citizens are more likely than New Yorkers to turn to
the police for help.

Overreporting and Fakery

"In Seattle, when something gets stolen the victims go to the police," Inspector
Julian said. "In this town, people come out and find their car window broken,
and say, 'Oh, the window's broken again.' "

And sometimes, he said, overreporting may skew the data. For example, the New
York City police estimate that as many as 25 percent of all reported auto thefts
are faked by people hoping to collect insurance money.

According to a national survey by the Department of Justice in 1990, Americans
report only about 38 percent of all crimes, and 48 percent of violent crimes. No
such studies are conducted on New York City alone.

The Federal statistics, released each spring in lengthy tables that can
simultaneously make the heart beat faster and the eyes glaze over, have been
good to Commissioner Brown.

For the first time in 36 years, reported crime in New York City dropped during
1991 in all seven categories -- murder, forcible rape, robbery, aggravated
assault, burglary, larceny theft and motor vehicle theft. During the first four
months of 1992, crime reports continued to buck the national trend by declining
overall, although reports of forcible rape and aggravated assault rose slightly.

Mayor Dinkins and Commissioner Brown have attributed the drop to the community
policing strategy, which has quadrupled the number of police officers walking
beats, to 3,000. Critics of the statistics conceded that the new police tactics
cannot be ignored as an explanation for the change.

But they caution that the numbers, weak as a measurement of crime, are even
shakier when used to judge police effectiveness.

"I don't think it's a very accurate gauge," said Hubert Williams, president of
the Police Foundation, a research group in Washington.

Mr. Williams was a sergeant in Newark during the riots of 1967, when the
statistics, he said, showed a drastic drop in crime. "Why? Because the airwaves
were so jammed the police weren't reporting crimes the way they should have
been," he said.

Later, as Newark Police Director, Mr. Williams created a new unit trained to
handle rape complaints to encourage victims to come forward. "Rape went up," he
said.

Calling Detective McCann

Police lore is rich with examples of officers fighting crime by changing the
numbers. In New York City in the 1940's, the joke was that unloved and unwanted
cases were assigned to Detective McCann -- that is, chucked in the garbage can
and never reported, said Thomas A. Reppetto, president of the Citizens Crime
Commission, a watchdog group.

After the Federal Bureau of Investigation criticized the department's statistics
in 1950, police headquarters began checking all precinct crime reports. That
year, robbery reports jumped 400 percent.

But the fictitious Detective McCann returned to duty in the early 1960's, Mr.
Reppetto said. After a new police chief cracked down in 1966, reported robbery
figures climbed again.

As recently as 1983, an audit of reports by the Chicago police revealed
widespread underreporting. "We were cheating and lying," said Dennis Nowicki,
who, as Chicago's Deputy Superintendent for the Bureau of Investigative
Services, conducted the audit. "It just became an institutionalized practice."

As Reliable as Possible

According to police officials and outside experts, computers and careful
checking have made New York City's crime reports as reliable as possible.

Patrol officers file the initial reports. After going to the scene of a robbery,
say, they fill out a police complaint form with such details as whether the
victim was shot or stabbed and the value of the stolen property.

The officers' supervisor then checks the form, signs it and sends it to
headquarters in lower Manhattan, where it is checked again for missing
information or inconsistencies. Clerks feed the information into the
department's computers, and then microfilm the original report.

When the Police Department began community policing two years ago, officials
worried that the new tactics might cause a jump in crime statistics, Inspector
Julian said. Because residents would grow comfortable with the beat officers
they saw every day, officials reasoned, they might become more likely to report
crimes.

The statistics did rise in the flagship community policing precinct, in Sunset
Park, Brooklyn. In 1991, crime reports there increased 32.3 percent. But in
other areas of the city where more beat officers were used, like midtown
Manhattan, reports fell.

All Statistics Can Look Good

Police officials say that reports rose in Sunset Park because officers were
making more drug arrests and fell in midtown because they scared away criminals,
preventing crimes. The analysis recalls a cynical joke among police experts: For
the police, any crime statistics are good crime statistics.

Instead of the seemingly scientific, objective measurement presented by crime
statistics, Commissioner Brown's new system will try to chart citizens'
subjective impressions of the performance of the police.

Violent crime rates rising in U.S., FBI says: Murder, assault, robbery:
Statistics Canada to release 2005 report next month

DATELINE: NEW YORK


NEW YORK - The United States became a more dangerous place last year compared to
2004, with more murders, robberies and aggravated assaults leading the biggest
rise in the violent crime rate since 2001, the FBI reported yesterday.

The number of murder victims exceeded 16,900 while there were at least 92,837
forcible rapes and almost 420,000 robberies. Among big U.S. cities, Dallas
emerged as the most dangerous, with economically depressed Detroit a close
second, while New York again enjoyed being dubbed the safest.

But experts differed on whether the statistics show the United States to be
significantly more dangerous than Canada, with one leading scholar arguing most
crime rates are similar except for homicide.

"The U.S. is higher in gun crime, but Canada has higher burglary rates, it has
higher theft rates, it has equivalent assault rates: it is a high-crime
society," said Marcus Felson, professor at the School of Criminal Justice of
Rutgers University in Newark, New Jersey.

"Western Canada is a very high-crime society, while eastern Canada is moderate
like New York, but that's partly for the wrong reason, namely it is too cold in
winter to commit much crime."

Statistics Canada will release Canada's 2005 crime statistics next month, but
annually warns against comparing them with the FBI list because the Canadian
roundup considers a greater number of violent offences.

The murder rate in the United States shot up 4.8% last year, marking the highest
percentage increase in 15 years. The robbery rate rose 4.5%, but the number of
forcible rapes reported dipped by 1.9%. More than 70,000 people have been
murdered in the United States since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001,
claimed almost 3,000 lives.

The overall trend bucks a general decline throughout the 1990s, but individual
spikes are explainable. For example, the arrival in Houston of thousands of
people fleeing Hurricane Katrina-ravaged New Orleans -- long known as a high-
crime city -- could have contributed to the 23% rise in the Texas city's murder
count, from 272 to 334.

"When new teenagers show up, they upset the pecking order," said Prof. Felson,
whose latest book, Crime and Nature, explores crime's symbiotic relationships
with society's legal activities.

Rapidly growing Las Vegas saw a 10% increase in its murder rate, from 131 to
144, but continued economic decline accompanied by a 14% rise in the number of
murders in Philadelphia, where there were 377 victims, up from 330.

"Philadelphia has more abandoned property than any city in America, and
Baltimore is second," Prof. Felson said. "So you have whole areas of the city
that are like a war zone. Not only is abandoned property used for crime, but
there is no one living and working there to look after the street."

The now-cooling housing boom and rising property prices meant developers snapped
up abandoned property in many other cities.

"Redevelopment was most marked in New York. Times Square was once a generator of
crime, but that is no longer the case," Prof. Felson said.

More than 12,000 law enforcement agencies submitted reports to the FBI, which
will release a more comprehensive review in the fall. In New York, Mayor Michael
Bloomberg credited the continued fall in violent crime to tougher policing and
his drive to get illegal guns off the streets.

But the entire Northeast showed the least marked rise in violent crime,
contrasting sharply with the Midwest, where there was an overall 5.7% increase.

In Canada in 2004 there were 622 murders, representing two for every 100,000
people. Some experts claim Canada's universal health care system does a better
job at saving lives.

"The difference between a homicide and a serious assault is often just how
quickly you can get a person to a hospital," said Ronald Melchers, criminology
professor at the University of Ottawa.

PRIME-TIME CRIME: A FULL-PAGE REPORT ON B2;
Why is fear rising if the violence is down?

SECTION: PERSPECTIVE; Pg. 01B

LENGTH: 278 words



Among Georgia's growth indexes, a new category is emerging: fear.

Even as FBI statistics say violent crime has declined statewide since 1990,
Georgians are more afraid than ever of falling prey to violence.

"There isn't a day that you watch the news when they aren't reporting that
someone was murdered or hurt," Chamblee resident Dorothy Orrok, 65, says with
resignation.

Orrok is among the 70 percent of Georgians surveyed in a recent Atlanta
Journal-Constitution/Georgia State University poll who say they, or someone in
their family, are more likely to become victims of violent crime now than they
were five years ago.

Only 4 percent say the risk is smaller.

If the rate of violent crime in Georgia is falling, why is the fear rising?

About 42 percent of Georgians, according to the poll, say they believe that
television and radio a which, along with government, the church and schools,
help shape perceptions in American society a are guilty of exaggerating violent
crime. But 52 percent say they think the media are accurate in their portrayal
of crime.

"I've sat through focus groups and the audience says, 'We don't want to see that
(crime coverage),' but then you look at what succeeds and what people watch,"
says Bud Veazey, news operations manager at WAGA/Channel 5 in Atlanta.

"Look at the highway when you have a wreck: That's when everyone stops to look."

Staff writers Gary M. Pomerantz and Denise Prodigo-Herrmann examine what drives
media coverage of violent crime and whether ubiquitous public fear would
diminish even if crime were relegated to the back pages of the newspaper and the
end of the broadcast. B/02.

Communities drawing a line in the streets

BYLINE: Bruce Frankel

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 8A

LENGTH: 1567 words

DATELINE: NEW YORK


Over the past five years the nation has moved away from a helpless acceptance of
the inevitability of violent crime and toward a shared belief that violence has
to stop, crime analysts say.

That may be the single most important factor in a sharp drop in urban crime many
believed was so stubborn it would be a permanent blight on the landscape of the
USA.

"What unites all these cities more than policing is a broad-based, informal
commitment to stop and reverse violence," says Christopher Stone of the Vera
Institute for Justice.

Falling homicide rates are being paid special attention because murder is one of
the most reliable crime statistics: almost all killings are reported. But
experts say that what's most astonishing is how sweeping the declines are across
all categories.

But opinions differ on where the nation is headed. Some analysts say
demographics account for much of the drop and, if that's true, another crime
wave could be on its way.

A bulging teen population enters the crime-prone years early in the next
century. Some criminologists warn that cities could be awash in blood unless the
nation redoubles its efforts now to prevent youth violence by increasing aid for
pre-school care and education, drug and child abuse prevention programs, and
jobs for at-risk youths.

"We kid ourselves if we think all it takes is getting communities to stand up to
violent youths" and making police more efficient, says Joseph Sheley of Tulane
University.

Others argue that the decline is evidence that higher levels of crime are not
inevitable.

"It's possible that this epidemic has passed, life is returning to normal and
the alarmist view of steadily skyrocketing crime is wrong," says criminologist
Sam Walker.

Police initiatives -- such as using computer analyses to target high-crime areas
and patterns of criminality, gang task forces aimed at taking guns away from
young people, storefront police stations and more cops -- also deserve credit,
says Houston police Chief Sam Nuchia.

But even he says the most potent weapon against violence has been the growing
public recognition that police can't stop crime by themselves, plus an almost
revolutionary community resolve to take responsibility for restoring normality.

"The citizens are tired of crime and being victims. This attitude of wanting to
do something about it now crosses all lines of race, economics and age," he
says. Even some of the city's toughest neighborhoods are supporting police
efforts.

Criminologists say pinpointing the reason for the decline in violent crime in
cities is all but impossible. Nor is the pattern uniform; violence has increased
in some cities, such as Milwaukee and Tucson.

Until very recently, crime has increased steadily in rural and suburban areas,
although they generally remain far safer than large cities. And while Americans
seem more afraid of crime, figures for 1994 show slight declines in crime in
every region in the country.

New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who has made crime-fighting a cornerstone of his
administration, chafes at suggestions that demographics or other factors out of
community and police control help to explain the drop in violence. He says
decreasing crime comes from a "team effort that starts at the top" and extends
to the "newest and youngest police officer."

New York Police Commissioner William Bratton says: "It's not the weather, it's
not crack cocaine, it's not demographics."

Officials say Bratton has commanded a highly systematic attack on crime,
including computerized pin maps used to shift patrols to where the worst crime
is.

He also has ordered local precinct police to resume responsibilities that have
rested exclusively with special squads, such as narcotics, for years. Beat
officers are again making drug busts, going after fencing operations and
pursuing warrants. They're also aggressively attacking annoying misdemeanors --
smoking in subways, urinating in public, people with squeegees pestering
motorists.

New York police are operating on the theory that controlling street disorder
sends an important signal that crime will not be tolerated, cuts down the
opportunities for crime and reduces public fear. Such misdemeanor arrests have
increased in almost direct proportion to the decrease in violent crimes.

"It's truly amazing what's happening. There's a cumulative effect to these
strategies that's greater than the sum of its parts," says Thomas Reppetto of
the Citizens Crime Commission in New York.

Police in New York and Chicago are reporting another significant change: They're
recovering about 20% fewer firearms from the people they arrest. Federal agents
say new gun laws may have stemmed the free flow of weapons from states with
minimal restrictions on gun sales. In Chicago, a new felony gun law appears to
be working.

Even battle-hardened New Yorkers see changes.

"I guess crime is going down," says Kay Hill, 78. "I haven't been mugged lately.
Not for four or five years."

The "only real crime I hear about is what I read about in the newspapers," says
Mike Orent, 48, a salesman. He sees "fewer crackheads" and more cops.

"And look how they redid the park," he says, gazing at an extensively restored
Bryant Park near New York's 42nd Street Library. "It's that kind of thing that
makes the city feel safer."

Kenny Wright, 30, a medical technician student, says this is no time to let down
the guard. "Even if the crime rate is dropping, you've got to be careful. You
shouldn't be out walking the streets alone at night."

Adell Goldstein, 89, a retired bookkeeper, says: "Personally I feel safe, but
then we're very careful. We rarely ever go out at night anymore and then only
with a group."

By mobilizing communities, "you put pressure on criminals," says Patrick Murphy
of the U.S. Conference of Mayors. "Since patrol cars arrived, police have been
trying to do it by themselves. They can't.

"They need people -- their ears and eyes."

"We're rising out of the ashes," says police Commander Leroy O'Shield of
Chicago's Austin District. He credits a host of police-community partnerships,
from street watch programs to mentoring to nuisance abatement programs.

The transformation of community attitudes, from passivity to outrage, "has been
quite a change," says Elliot Currie, a criminologist who lectures at the
University of California-Berkeley. "It's my guess that's what's bearing fruit."

What's working in fight against crime

A combination of factors is behind the decline in violent crime in many of the
nation's biggest cities, analysts say:

-- Growing community intolerance of crime.

-- Community policing practices that re-establish trust between residents and
officers on the beat. The practices include having regular problem-solving
meetings and encouraging officers to get other agencies involved in efforts to
change conditions, such as abandoned housing or darkened street lights, that
foster crime.

In return, police get their strongest weapon: information.

-- Strategic policing: computer mapping of crime hot spots and targeting those
areas with anti-violence task forces.

-- Vigorous law enforcement on all levels of crime, not just criminal activity
involving violence or other felonies.

-- Police pursuit of all outstanding arrest warrants.

-- Innovative anti-violence, conflict-resolution, gang- and truancy-prevention
programs for young people. Also, more community rewards for good academic and
civic performance by youths of all ages.

Number of homicides drop in most big cities

The number of homicides fell in at least seven of the nation's 10 largest cities
during the first six months of 1995. (Statistics for San Diego, the nation's
sixth largest city, were not available.) Homicide is often considered the best
indicator of overall crime because virtually every homicide is reported.

Miami Beach top crime city in U.S.

BYLINE: Special

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. C11

LENGTH: 484 words


   DETROIT (Special) - Miami Beach, Fla., led major U.S. cities in serious crime
last year, according to Federal Bureau of Investigation crime figures released
yesterday.

Dramatic increases in drug-related burglary and larceny rates are responsible
for the city's Number 1 ranking, a computer analysis of the data showed.

In 1987, Miami Beach came 12th in over-all crime, second in larceny and fourth
in burglary.

Washington, D.C., led the United States in per capita homicides last year, a
position Detroit had held the past four years.

Burglaries down

Newark, N.J., ranked first in robbery and vehicle theft, Atlanta in assault and
Salt Lake City in larceny. Flint, Mich., led in rape, Mobile, Ala., in burglary
and Pomona, Calif., in arson.

The number of serious crimes rose 3 per cent across the United States in 1988,
the FBI said. Assaults were up 7 per cent, robberies 4 per cent, murders 3 per
cent and rapes 1 per cent.

Three of the four property crimes monitored by the bureau also increased.
Vehicle thefts rose 11 per cent, larcenies 2 per cent and arsons 1 per cent.
Burglaries decreased 1 per cent.

Miami Beach, which never before had been in the top 10 in over-all crime, has
become the latest victim of the U.S. drug epidemic, said local police spokesman
Sergeant James Mazer.

"It's all related to crack cocaine," he added.

The city, next door to Miami, recorded 17,617 crimes per 100,000 residents in
1988 - a 25 per cent jump from 1987.

Mazer estimated that 70 per cent of the city's larcenies and burglaries are the
work of cocaine addicts financing their habits by preying on city residents.
City council recently approved adding 50 officers to the 300-member police
department in a bid to counter the problem.

The computer analysis was based on FBI crime figures for 191 of the largest U.S.
cities, those with populations around 100,000.

Drug czar

Police officials in Washington, D.C., also blamed drugs for the city's
well-publicized homicide rate.

"Roughly 60 to 65 per cent of our homicides appear to be drug related," said a
spokesman for the District of Columbia Police Department. "They involve addicts
and dealers, drug debts and territorial disputes."

The force has redeployed police and imposed a curfew to combat the problem, but
the district's growing drug plague recently prompted federal drug czar William
Bennett to propose assigning federal agents to work in drug-infested areas.

The District of Columbia recorded 369 homicides in 1988 - 59.5 killings for
every 100,000 residents. The homicide rate rose 65 per cent last year, placing
the capital slightly ahead of Detroit, which recorded 629 homicides, or 57.8 for
every 100,000 residents. Detroit's homicide rate dropped 7.9 per cent in 1988.

Detroit recorded a 4.5 per cent decrease in over-all per capita crime, ranking
22nd last year.

FBI report: Violent and property crime down;
Some community flare-ups defy statistics

BYLINE: Kevin Johnson, USA TODAY

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 306 words


Overall violent crime and property offenses declined slightly last year across
much of the country, continuing a downward trajectory even as some communities
battled disparate surges in violence, according to a new FBI report.

Robbery recorded the largest decline at 5.6%, and murder was down 0.5% in 2014,
but rape and aggravated assault ticked up 2.4% and 2%, respectively, the report
found. Property offenses dropped in each category: Burglary was down 10.5%,
larceny-theft declined by nearly 3% and vehicle thefts declined by 1.5%.

The FBI report comes as some cities confront troubling increases in violence,
prompting the Justice Department to call a meeting next month of law enforcement
authorities "to explore what measures are working," Deputy Attorney General
Sally Yates said Monday.

"We have witnessed a remarkable drop in crime since the 1980s, both violent
crime and crime overall," Yates said. "Entire cities have been transformed,
unlocking tremendous potential and releasing a wave of prosperity. But despite
these successes, we know it's not true everywhere. There are still neighborhoods
-- far too many neighborhoods -- where bloodshed has become a fact of life."

Yates' remarks in Detroit came while announcing an expansion of the federal
Violence Reduction Network to include five more cities where violent crime has
increased at a rate above the national average: Compton, Calif.; Flint, Mich.;
Little Rock; West Memphis, Ark.; and Newark. The program, launched last year in
Camden, N.J.; Wilmington, Del.; Detroit; Chicago; and the Oakland-Richmond,
Calif., area, provides communities with access to federal law enforcement
resources to assist local agencies.

In Flint,  where homicide is up nearly 70% this year, Police Chief James W.
Tolbert said the violence is commonly related to domestic abuse, drugs and
robbery.

El Paso ranked safest large city in U.S. for 3rd straight year

BYLINE: Daniel Borunda, El Paso Times, Texas

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 314 words


Feb. 06--El Paso has been named the "safest large city" in the nation for the
third time, according to rankings by a research publishing firm.

Officials credited law

enforcement and residents working together in making El Paso the city with the
"lowest crime rate ranking" of cities more than 500,000 population in the annual
City Crime Rankings by CQ Press.

Mayor John Cook said there are a couple of reasons that El Paso is "the number
one safest large city in the United States."

"The first is a great Police Department," Cook said. The second reason is "we
have a focus on community policing in that we get everybody involved (in
fighting crime). The things we are doing are working."

El Paso has been in the top three large cities with the lowest crime rates since
1997.

The rankings used to be named the "safest" and "dangerous" rankings and are
still commonly known by those names,

but CQ Press changed the official name to the "City Crime Rankings" a few years
ago.

The rankings are based on yearly data from the FBI's Uniform Crime Report for
the crimes of murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary,
larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft and arson.

There were 33 cities in the rankings with a more than a half-million people.

"All El Pasoans should be proud of this recognition as it is truly a reflection
of the El Paso community," Police Chief Greg

Allen said in a news release.

U.S. CRIME DROP AT A STANDSTILL, FBI DATA SHOW;
THE RATE, WHICH IMPROVED FOR EIGHT STRAIGHT YEARS IN THE '90S, WAS UNCHANGED FOR
THE FIRST HALF OF 2000 AND EDGES UP IN SOME MAJOR CITIES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON


WASHINGTON After eight years of record-setting improvements, the nation's battle
to rein in crime appears to have stalled, with crime in some major cities edging
back up, according to new FBI data released Monday.

The nation's crime rate, which dropped by as much as 6 percent or 7 percent a
year through much of the 1990s, virtually was unchanged for the first half of
2000. Nationwide, serious crime declined by a negligible 0.3 percent, with
slight increases in rape and assault.

Some of the country's biggest cities often a harbinger of criminal trends
nationwide saw significant upturns in murder and less serious types of crime,
including Los Angeles, Boston, Dallas, New Orleans and Philadelphia.

Criminologists are still searching for explanations.

Some say that it is not altogether surprising after so many years of unchecked
decline.

Another possible explanation is that many hard-core convicts who were imprisoned
during the crime wave of the 1980s and early 1990s are being released after
doing their time, only to be rearrested, many scholars suggest.

But they warn that if police and lawmakers become too complacent, the nation
might be headed for the kind of huge upturn in violence seen in the late 1980s
and early 1990s as the crack drug market swelled.

"If in fact we're seeing a leveling off in crime rates, we're going to need to
look for new solutions," said Garen Wintemute, a gun expert and director of the
Violence Prevention Research Program at UC Davis. "It's important not to assume
that what we need is more of the same old ideas."

For the first half of 2000, the FBI's preliminary data collected from law
enforcement agencies nationwide showed that violent crime and property crime
were each down 0.3 percent compared with June 1999.

Showing the biggest drop-off among particular types of crime were arson, with a
decline of 2.7 percent, and robbery, down 2.6 percent. But several crimes began
to edge upward, with motor vehicle thefts increasing 1.2 percent and rape and
aggravated assault each increasing 0.7 percent.

Los Angeles was one of more than half a dozen major cities that saw noticeable
rises in homicides in the first half of the year.

Homicides also went up 38 percent in Jacksonville, Fla., 36 percent in New
Orleans, 33 percent in Boston, 23 percent in Dallas, 10 percent in Philadelphia
and 3 percent in New York.

Rural areas, meanwhile, reported a 7.1 percent jump in the number of homicides.

The most likely explanation for the flattening crime rate, experts say, is
simply that crime could not keep going down forever after reaching its lowest
levels since the 1960s and enjoying the longest sustained decline since federal
officials began keeping such records in the 1930s.

MURDERS FEWEST IN 33 YEARS;
ACCORDING TO THE FBI'S REPORT, THE NUMBER OF SERIOUS CRIMES IN 1999 ALSO DROPPED
7 PERCENT

BYLINE: Michael J. Sniffen

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A17

WASHINGTON The nation's overall murder rate hit a 33-year low in 1999, but Los
Angeles' rate held steady and the city ranked second behind New York in sheer
number of killings, the FBI reported Sunday.

Los Angeles reported 425 homicides in 1999 and 426 in 1998.

The number of murders rose in several other large California cities.

In California, the largest murder increases were in Sacramento, which rose from
31 to 54, and San Diego, up from 42 to 57. San Francisco also had an increase
from 58 to 64.

In Oakland, murders fell from 72 in 1998 to 60 last year. San Jose also had a
decline from 29 to 25.

Nationwide, serious crimes reported to police dipped for a record eighth
straight year, falling 7 percent from 1998. The overall violent crime rate sank
to a 21-year low 525 murders, rapes, robberies and assaults for every 100,000
residents. The last time the figure was lower 498 in 1978 came well before an
epidemic of crack cocaine sent violent crime soaring in the mid-1980s.

The murder rate was the lowest since 1966; 5.7 per 100,000 in 1999, compared
with 5.6 in 1966.

But the FBI report contained a hint that big gains against crime may be about to
slow down.

Big cities with more than 1 million residents showed the smallest decline in
murder rate of any size community, down just 4 percent from 13.5 to 13 per
100,000. The largest, New York, saw murders rise, from 633 in 1998 to 671 in
1999.

In Nevada, Las Vegas showed a drop in murders from 116 to 109 last year, while
Reno had an increase from 10 in 1998 to 14 in 1999.

"The big cities are reaching their limit" in crime reduction, said James Alan
Fox, a professor at Northeastern University in Boston. The murder totals are
considered the most reliable figures in the FBI report and a leading general
indicator of crime.

"The big cities were the first to go up in the 1980s, the first to come down in
the 1990s," said professor Alfred Blumstein of Carnegie Mellon University in
Pittsburgh. "Now, having the lowest murder rate decline suggests they'll be the
first to stabilize. Murders and crime can't go down forever."

Nationwide, the rate and the number of all seven major violent and property
crimes declined, despite an increase in the U.S. population, the FBI reported.

The national total for the seven serious crimes reported to 17,000 police
agencies around the nation was 11,635,149 in 1999, down 20 percent since 1990.
The number of reported crimes was down 10 percent in the West, 7 percent in the
Northeast and Midwest and 5 percent in the South. The totals were down 7 percent
in cites and rural areas and 8 percent in suburbs.

Among violent crimes, the population-adjusted rate for murder fell 8.5 percent;
for robbery, 8.4 percent; for aggravated assault, 6.2 percent; and for rape, 4.3
percent.

Among property crimes, the rate for burglary fell 10 percent; for auto theft,
7.7 percent, and for larceny-theft, 5.7 percent.

The overall decline extended a trend begun in 1992 that is now almost three
times longer than the second-longest decline, the three years from 1982 through
1984. FBI records go back through 1960.

Attorney General Janet Reno said, "American families are safer today than they
have been in a generation. But we cannot rest." She advocated more work to
ensure that the 500,000 Americans to be released from prison this year end up in
jobs rather than back behind bars.

President Clinton attributed crime declines to administration legislation giving
local communities "better tools including 100,000 more police for our streets,
stronger gun laws and smart prevention."

Republicans in Congress credited local efforts and a GOP-sponsored law they said
induced 27 states to impose longer prison terms in exchange for federal money to
build prisons.

Academic experts credited both parties' favorite anti-crime remedies but also
factors beyond control of politicians, like the aging of baby boomers past crime
-prone years.

They also cited the decline of crack cocaine and the violent gangs that sold it,
an increase in community-based prevention programs, police targeting of illegal
weapons and a better economy.

Fox and Blumstein found math problems and mistakes in the FBI report.

The FBI said the lifetime risk of being murdered has plunged since 1978: One out
of every 240 Americans alive in 1997 would be murdered, down from one out of
every 157 alive in 1978.

But the FBI also said the risk for older black Americans declined by 130
percent. "A decrease of 100 percent brings you down to zero murders," Blumstein
noted. "Over 100 percent means negative murders, and there's not a lot of
resurrection around."

The FBI's James Noonan acknowledged: "It should say the risk was 130 percent
higher in 1978; the decline since is around 50 percent."

Fox pointed out "a horribly misleading example of rounding" in the FBI's
statement that firearms rose from accounting for 6 of 10 murders to 7 of 10
which seems like a 16.6 percent increase. The unrounded rise was from 6.48 to
6.52 "a statistically insignificant 0.4 percent increase," Fox said.

The FBI's Carlos Davis agreed: "The rounding is deceptive. We should not have
made that comparison."

ST. LOUIS POLICE STUDY HIGHLIGHTS CRIME HERE

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 1B

LENGTH: 341 words


Crime figures showing two Missouri cities - St. Louis and Kansas City - among
the top 10 most crime-ridden have left police spokesmen disappointed.

But St. Louis Police Chief Clarence Harmon was not shocked, and neither was
Kansas City Police Capt. Vince McInerney.

Harmon said: "We are a city of 65 square miles and a city of increasing poverty.
Crime is up; income is down. The average age of our residents has increased, and
it's the elderly who often are the victims of crime. . . . We've got to apply
our craft better."

St. Louis ranked No. 3 among the nation's 50 most populous cities in total
serious crime per capita in 1993 behind Miami and Atlanta.

Kansas City ranked No. 5.

St. Louis also ranked No. 3 in murder behind New Orleans and Washington. St.
Louis' per capita murder index means that one of every 1,500 city residents was
murdered last year.

The rankings also show that St. Louis led the country in arson, was second in
assaults, third in robberies and burglaries, fourth in auto theft, seventh in
larcenies and 23rd in rape.

The St. Louis Police Department compiled the rankings based on statistics
recently provided by the FBI and applied to 1990 census figures. Harmon said he
hoped that examining the FBI results and local census data, particularly
concerning poverty, would help the department better deploy its officers.

"We'll be making stronger efforts in interdicting in homicides and assaults in
the coming year," Harmon said, "and we'll be doing some things regarding drug
use."

Harmon said he still feels much of the city is relatively safe. "I want to
stress that most of the violence is contained in certain pockets where poverty
is high, and that much of the violence is committed between people who know each
other."

McInerney, of Kansas City, said, "We've opened up three community action network
offices, and we'll be expanding to nine next month."

The program is a storefront operation in which a community activist, two police
officers and a city employee are available.

NEW LOW IN STATE OF CRIME DROP MAKES N.Y. SIXTH SAFEST IN U.S.

BYLINE: BY ADAM LISBERG DAILY NEWS STAFF WRITER

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 8

LENGTH: 324 words


CRIME DROPPED statewide last year, approaching a 40-year low and making New York
the safest large state in the nation.

New FBI statistics show crime per capita dropped 2.7% statewide last year, led
by a 5.2% drop in violent crimes such as murder, rape and robbery.

It was the 11th straight year that the crime rate dropped, making New York the
sixth-safest state overall, up from seventh-safest the previous year.

"These statistics prove, once again, that our tough, smart criminal justice
policies, and hardworking local law enforcement, are having a real effect on
making New Yorkers safer," crowed Gov. Pataki.

"Although this is very good news, we know there is much more that can be done,"
he said. "To continue this unprecedented reduction in crime, we must do
everything in our power to give police officers and community leaders the tools
they need to keep the people of New York safe."

Pataki called for new laws to notify communities of sexual predators in their
midst and to keep the worst offenders locked up after they've finished their
prison terms. He also called on legislators to expand a DNA data bank of
criminals.

The FBI's figures show crime at its lowest level in New York in the almost 40
years since statewide crime reporting began.

Overall, crime in New York in the last 10 years has fallen 44.9%, with a decline
of 51.6% in violent crimes, including a 55.9% drop in murders.

The trend mirrors the astonishing drop in crime in New York City, where a police
force that was swamped by 2,245 murders in 1990 is now cautiously hoping to
record fewer than 500 homicides this year - a level unseen since 1961.

FBI: Violent crime down in U.S. during 2013

WASHINGTON | The FBI says the number of violent crimes reported to law
enforcement last year dropped by 4.4 percent from 2012.

The crime statistics released by the FBI on Monday also showed a longer-term
decline, over the last five years, in both violent crime and property crime.

The report says the number of violent crimes reported to law enforcement last
year was roughly 1.16 million, down significantly from the 2012 estimate.

Attorney General Eric Holder called the drop in violent crime a "remarkable
achievement" that's part of a continuing trend.

15 hikers from Calif. church group found safe

PASADENA, CALIF. | Fifteen hikers from a church group who failed to return from
a day hike in the Southern California mountains were found safe by a helicopter
search crew Monday morning.

The Los Angeles County sheriff's helicopter hoisted the hikers out of the
wilderness and they were driven to a nature center and reunited with family and
friends.

The hikers, 11 adults and four teens, had set out Sunday morning. Later, as they
began losing daylight, they decided it was safer to build a fire, shelters and
stay put, members of the group said.

Abduction suspect  to be tried first in Pa.

PHILADELPHIA | A man accused of abducting a Philadelphia woman just weeks after
a similar Virginia crime will be tried in the Pennsylvania case first.

Authorities say the 37-year-old Barnes grabbed a 22-year-old woman walking home
from a bus stop last week. Police found the pair three days later in Jessup, Md.
Officials say that case will be tried before Barnes is prosecuted in the
abduction and attempted murder of a 16-year-old Richmond girl.

Crime down, but final tally not yet in

BYLINE: Kevin Johnson

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 496 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

WASHINGTON -- Despite a slight increase in homicides, overall violent crime in
the USA declined by 1.3% during the first six months of this year compared with
the same period last year, according to an FBI report released Monday.

The 0.3% increase in homicides and a nearly 1% jump in robberies were countered
by larger declines in aggravated assaults (2.4%) and rapes (1.7%).

In most years, the FBI's six-month status report is considered a good predictor
for the bureau's year-end crime analysis. For nearly a decade, the interim
report has forecast dramatic declines in crime for the overall year.


But the new numbers, measuring from January to June, do not account for an
erratic period for local law enforcement in the weeks immediately after the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.

During that time, some cities reported sudden increases in homicides and other
violent crimes.

Police officials in Philadelphia, for example, say they believe that a surge in
murders there in September and October was partly the result of the abrupt
reassignment of officers from troubled neighborhoods to anti-terrorism duties in
other parts of the city.

Analysts also say that the fragile national economy is just beginning to
influence local crime trends as unemployment rates increase in many cities
across the country.

"When crime goes down, the mayors and police chiefs usually take the credit,"
says Joseph McNamara, a former police chief in Kansas City, Mo., and San Jose,
Calif., who is now a research fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford
University. "When crime goes up, it's usually about the economy in some form."

Police in Gary, Ind., which has been hit with a string of recent layoffs, say
the relationship between crime and the economy is at least partly the cause for
a jump in homicides this year.

There have been 81 homicides in Gary through this past weekend, up from 71 at
the same time last year.

And there was no sign the upward trend was about to slow. Monday afternoon,
police were responding to another homicide.

"We really have a battle on our hands," said Sgt. Thomas Branson, commander of
the Gary Police Department's homicide unit. "It seems like we're running all the
time."

Branson said the city of about 100,000 people has been hit with a rash of
drug-related killings and domestic homicides.

"You gotta think the layoffs have put a lot of pressure on people," Branson
said.



Changes for various crimes

The total number of violent and property crimes fell by 0.3% nationally in the
first half of 2001 compared with the same period in 2000, the FBI says. Changes
compared with 2000 for various types of crimes:

Violent crimes --1.3%

Property crimes --0.2%

Murder +0.3%

Rape --1.7%

Robbery +0.8%

Aggravated assault --2.4%

Burglary --1.2%

Larceny theft --0.4%

Motor vehicle theft +2.6%

Crack's fall from favour cuts violent crime in US

BYLINE: Mark Tran in New York

SECTION: The Guardian Foreign Page; Pg. 13

LENGTH: 381 words


AMERICANS can thank the ebbing of the crack cocaine epidemic and tighter
controls on hand-guns for the drop in violent crime that has pushed the murder
rate to its lowest point in 30 years.

The crack epidemic was concentrated in black neighbourhoods of big cities such
as New York and Los Angeles, and affected those born in the 1950s and 1960s. But
people born in the 1970s have rejected crack after seeing the devastation it
caused among family and friends, a process chronicled in movies such as John
Singleton's Boyz N the Hood.

'Crack generated huge demand with users wanting a hit 10-20 times a day,' said
Bruce Johnson, a researcher at the National Development and Research Institutes
in New York.'The extreme number of transactions involved a lot of people
although crack use was heavily penalised and so much money was involved that
violence became a court of last resort to settle differences. Easy access to
guns contributed to the violence.' Violent crimes have declined as crack has
fallen out of fashion. Overall, the levels of both violent and property crimes
have fallen to their lowest since 1973, when such surveys started. Violent crime
surged unexpectedly when crack took hold around 1985, and then began to fall in
1991. Most crime experts see a direct link between crack cocaine and violent
crime.

Since 1991, murders have plunged by 31 per cent, to 6.8 per 100,000 in 1997 from
9.8 per 100,000, while robberies have fallen 32 per cent to 185 per 100,000 in
1997 from 272 per 100,000 according to the FBI.

The Clinton administration has been quick to claim credit for the plunge in
crime.

'This is a remarkable progress and it shows that our strategy of more police,
tougher gun laws and better crime prevention is making a difference,' President
Clinton said earlier his month.

With crack out of favour, the drug of choice is now 'blunts', cheap cigars dosed
with marijuana. Blunts have become the preferred drug for the generation born in
the 1970s who want to avoid using crack or heroin.

Other factors cited in the drop in violence are aggressive tactics to stop gun
violence, including frequent searches as used in New York, and improved efforts
to trace guns used in crimes and arrest gun traffickers, as used in Boston.

Crime drops across U.S. Experts warn of next wave

BYLINE: Denver Post Wire Services

WASHINGTON - Violent crime dropped 4 percent last year as overall serious
offenses reported to police declined for the fourth straight year. But one
expert said a slight increase in larceny foreshadows a surge in youth crime.

Reporting yesterday on preliminary data for 1995, the FBI said the overall total
for seven major crimes was down 2 percent from 1994.

Crime fell in every category and in every region of the country, dropping most
sharply - 4 percent - in the Northeast. The Midwest saw a 2 percent decline; the
South and West recorded 1 percent reductions.

Scholars, law enforcement officers and Democratic and Republican members of
Congress hailed the data but unanimously warned that the large national trends
mask an alarming rise in teenage violence.

"We shouldn't be lulled into a false sense of security," said Rep. Bill
McCollum, R-Fla., chairman of the House crime subcommittee.

Attorney General Janet Reno pledged to "continue to put more cops on the beat,
get guns off the street and put violent criminals behind bars."

New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and other cities with more than 1 million people
reported the largest decline - 6 percent. Smaller cities of 500,000 or more saw
an increase of 1 percent, while rural counties reported a 3 percent increase in
crime.

Twenty-four large cities - primarily in the South and in California - reported a
drop in serious crime of at least 10 percent in 1995, with the most dramatic
drop reported by Tampa, Fla. - 20 percent.

Murder declined most dramatically, falling 8 percent to about 21,400 murders for
1995, down from a peak of about 24,700 murders in 1991, according to FBI
statistics.

Robbery was down 7 percent; rape 6 percent; and aggravated assault 3 percent.

Total property crimes dropped 1 percent, with auto theft down by 6 percent and
burglary 5 percent. The only increase was in larceny-theft - up 1 percent.

The Clinton administration's push to put 100,000 more police on community
streets, along with aggressive programs to get guns out of juvenile hands, have
contributed largely to the decline, said Alfred Blumstein, criminology professor
at Carnegie Mellon University and a researcher for the Department of Justice.

But people should not be lulled by the falling numbers, "not by any stretch of
the imagination," said David G. Walchak, Concord, N.H., police chief and
president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police.

"In fact, they should be very concerned," he said.

The juvenile population will increase 30 percent by 2005, and with it, so will
violence, Walchak said. Police officials "have a great fear of what is going to
happen."

The increase in larcenies "is the first glimmer of the impact of the next
generation," said Blumstein, "because larceny - such as bicycle theft, stealing
auto parts and shoplifting - is the crime with the youngest criminals. The peak
age for larcenists is 15 or 16." Most burglars and robbers are older.

"In the other crimes, what's going on among teenagers is being swamped by much
larger numbers of older folks who are growing out of the high crime ages and
giving up crime," Blumstein added.

James Alan Fox, dean of criminal justice at Northeastern University, explained
that "this calm before the crime storm won't last much longer."

The murder rate for teenagers grew by 22 percent between 1990 and 1994, Fox
said. "Over the next 10 years, the teen population will expand by 17 percent,
because there are now 39 million children under age 10, more than we've had
since the 1950s when the baby boomers were in grade school."

In addition to citing the aging of baby boomers, experts and officials
attributed the four-year crime decline to closer police work with citizens,
longer prison sentences for violent criminals, crackdowns on illegal guns,
declining unemployment and rising public intolerance for crime.

The drop in crime in 1995 is good news for the Clinton administration in an
election year in which Republicans are searching for a way to criticize the
president as weak on crime.

But the administration had little to say about the crime statistics.

FBI Director Louis Freeh declined to comment on the numbers.

Associate Attorney General John Schmidt attributed the drop in part to the
commitment to 100,000 police officers on local streets, but stressed, "There is
an instinct to want to take credit. The danger with that, of course, is that if
they go back up."

Florida's dubious distinction paints picture of state in fear / But some say FBI
statistics are misleading

BYLINE: Deborah Sharp

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 4A

LENGTH: 1032 words

DATELINE: FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.


The unofficial motto in this south Florida city has always given crime-wary
residents comfort: We're Not Miami.

Best-known previously for its spring-break beaches, Fort Lauderdale just stole
Miami's title as the USA's crime capital.

But the picture is even worse for the state. Three top cities - Fort Lauderdale,
Miami and Tampa - rank 1-2-3 atop the FBI's "serious crime" list for the first
half of 1994.

"Serious crime" includes homicide, rape, robbery and assault, as well as
burglary and car theft.

Tourism officials fear a worsening of the state's already crime-ridden
reputation. And for south Floridians, many living in small communities in Fort
Lauderdale's Broward County and in Miami's Dade, a fragile sense of security is
further shattered.

Retiree Al Pastore can't draw a quorum at his Disabled American Veterans
meetings because fearful residents won't come out at night. "Some of them have
been mugged," says Pastore, 76, a former high school teacher. "They're afraid."

It took Brooks Moss, 30, a Paris-born mother of two now living in suburban Coral
Springs, just three months in south Florida to swallow her distaste for guns and
try out C.W.'s Shooters Emporium.

Her first lesson: Handling a .38-caliber revolver. "It's like having a credit
card. You know you have it, but you don't have to use it."

But some law enforcement leaders and criminologists here complain reporting of
the FBI's national statistics paints an inaccurate picture of crime in the
state:

-- Reported crimes are tallied against 12 million permanent residents, creating
a higher ranking than if Florida's 40 million tourists a year were factored in.

-- Year-round sunny weather means Florida counts 12 months of crime, while
offenses drop dramatically in Northern winters.

"Does anyone seriously believe the Sun Belt cities are more dangerous than
Chicago or Detroit? That's incredible," says William Wilbanks, a criminal
justice professor at Florida International University.

Fort Lauderdale officials say the No. 1 ranking is unfair, since so much of the
city's crime is auto theft and other non-violent offenses.

"Our biggest problem today is juvenile crime, and that's not just Fort
Lauderdale, it's the entire state . . ." says police Detective Sonya Friedman.

Adds Mayor Jim Naugle, "The incredible thing with these statistics is a murder
is counted the same as an auto burglary. I don't know how much sense that
makes."

Psychologists say dramatic TV crime footage can shape perceptions, contributing
to fears that otherwise may be unfounded.

"There are very important changes in behavior, often times not based on anything
very factual," says Atlanta-based Morton Bard, co-author of The Crime Victim's
Book.

Bard's own in-laws, though never crime victims in New York, became so frightened
they would be, that they moved. Destination: Miami, now ranked fourth in the
FBI's sub-category of violent crime, to New York's 27th.

The FBI's "serious crime" list includes violent acts, such as rape or murder,
and also property crimes like car theft and larceny. For violent crimes alone,
Fort Lauderdale's ranking is less dramatic: No. 41 of the USA's 183 largest
cities.

Truck driver Ernesto Pedroza, 27, says he hasn't felt as threatened by the
Sunshine State's crime as he did in his former home of Chicago.

But "we're getting there," he says. "When I work the night shift, and my wife
stays home alone, I worry. I think about it all the time."

Crime has become a fact of life.

"I live in a nice area, but things have started to happen," says Lynette
Pelling, 44, who works at C.W.'s shooting range. "Break-ins, a man was killed in
his home. There was a rapist on a street just north of us."

Larry Harris, 12, is about to enter the statistical category carrying the
greatest chance of being a crime victim in south Florida and nationwide: young
black man, age 15-24.

Harris says he saw a 17-year-old friend shot and killed by a drunk last year
when the friend wouldn't hand over his money.

"There's a lot of crime," says Harris. "My mom says every time you go to sleep,
lock the doors, because people might break into the house."

Fed-up residents turn to community-police partnerships.

"It makes you feel good to watch crime on TV, and say, 'Not in my area,' " says
Ed Alvarez, 38, of Pompano Beach. His Neighborhood Watch helped kick burglars,
prostitutes and drug dealers out of a church parking lot.

"The more you're aware of a problem, the more you can keep people working on the
solution."

Most women in jail held for drug crimes

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 947 words


More women are held in jails across the USA on drug crimes than on any other
charges, a Justice Department report Sunday says. Cited: the number of women
held in jails for drug crimes climbed to 11,970 in 1989, up from 1,999 held in
1983. The survey, of 424 jails, also found:

- Convicted females were about twice as likely as men to have used drugs daily a
month prior to their arrests.

- More than two-thirds of arrested women had children 18 years and under.

- One in four women committed crimes to support their drug habit.

- Females charged with violent crimes dropped from 21% in 1983 to 13% in 1989.

- Half of the women arrested in 1989 were convicted.

Drug charges on increase
Percentage of men and women held in local jails that are facing drug charges:
         1983      1989
Men        9%       21.9%
Women     13.1%     33.6%

INDIANA CRASH: Pilot error caused the February crash of a Kentucky Air National
Guard transport plane in Evansville, Ind., that killed 16 people, The Evansville
Courier reported, quoting unidentified military sources. Cited: Pilots were
distracted while performing an engine failure maneuver and didn't notice a drop
in airspeed that caused the C-130 Hercules to stall and plummet Feb. 16 into
jojos restaurant. Two restaurant workers, five crew members and nine people from
the nearby Drury Inn were killed. Military officials wouldn't comment other than
to say findings of a safety board probe will be released in a couple weeks.

AIR MISHAPS: British Airways officials inspected all seven of their Concorde
jets after a 5-by-10-foot rudder piece fell off during a Concorde flight from
London to New York. No one was hurt in the Saturday incident. The jet landed
safely at Kennedy International Airport. It was the third time since 1989
Concorde rudders have disengaged.

- Also Sunday: Delta Air Lines Flight 1123 bound for Cleveland blew a tire on
takeoff but landed safely an hour later back at Hartsfield Atlanta International
Airport. And passengers of Delta Flight 416 were evacuated at the
Cincinnati-Northern Kentucky International Airport after several officials
reported smelling smoke. No fire was found or injuries reported.

ABANDONED CHILD: A Virginia couple were charged with abandoning their 11-year-
old daughter on a highway after the girl refused to commit suicide with them,
police said. The unidentified girl told police she was dropped off shoeless on
I-77 near Rocky Gap, Va., after her parents ''asked her if she would go with
them to heaven,'' Virginia State Trooper D.P. Whittemore said. Lorne Wayne
Cooper, 27, and Cassandra Cooper, 29, of Woodbridge, Va., were arrested Saturday
60 miles north in Beckley, W.Va. The girl's 5-year-old brother was with them but
was unharmed.

DOG ATTACK: A 7-year-old District Heights, Md., girl was in critical condition
in a Washington, D.C., hospital after being mauled by three Rottweilers and
another large dog Saturday. The unnamed girl went to retrieve a ball in a
relative's yard when neighbor dogs attacked her. Adults freed the girl when a
smaller dog distracted the attacking dog. The smaller dog was killed. No charges
have been filed. The dogs are being held by animal control.

TRANSIT TALK: Talks continue today in Pittsburgh, Pa., between Port Authority
Transit officials and 2,700 striking bus drivers and trolley operators. The lack
of a settlement this weekend means commuters begin another work week without
buses and light rail vehicles.

ALCOHOL TREATMENT: Civil rights activist Hosea Williams entered an Atlanta
alcohol treatment program Friday after serving a 30-day prison term for a July
hit-and-run traffic accident. Williams, 66, began his 60-day program at the
Psychiatric Institute of Atlanta after being held in the De Kalb County Jail. He
had tried to enroll in the Betty Ford Center in Rancho Mirage, Calif., but
couldn't get a slot. Williams has a history of more than two dozen driving
violations.

ALSO SUNDAY ...

- TRAINS COLLIDE: Two freight trains collided head-on in Fulton, Ky., killing
one crewman. Cause: unknown.

- FEELING BETTER: Former Alabama governor George Wallace's condition was
improving in a Birmingham, Ala., hospital after he suffered respiratory problems
Friday, officials said. Wallace, 72, remained connected to a ventilator in the
intensive care unit at University Hospital. Wallace had been complaining of
chronic pain.

- PREGNANT ATTACK: Police in Tampa, Fla., charged Calvin Wilson, 27, with
attempted murder of pregnant neighbor Andreana Bryant, 19, who was stabbed
Saturday while sleeping on her couch. Bryant's baby - delivered three months
premature - died Sunday.

- CLUB SHOOTING: Georgette Johnson, 20, was killed and five others were injured
when a man fired a 9mm automatic pistol into a New York City club, police said.
No arrests were made.

Bush's FAA nominee drops out

Jerry Curry, 59, withdrew his nomination to head the Federal Aviation
Administration Saturday. Curry, head of the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration, backed away from the post after he was accused of criticizing
Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., and White House chief of state Samuel Skinner. Curry
said his remarks were misinterpreted and in a letter to President Bush said: ''I
am certain I could have served you well in that capacity. ... However, because
of recent personal considerations, I request that you withdraw my nomination.''
White House staffers said Curry will be offered another government post. No one
else has been tapped to fill the post vacated by James Busey.

CONVERSATION STARTER: Should Georgia pass a hate crimes law?;
 SaturdayTalk

BYLINE: Benita M. Dodd, Staff

SOURCE: AJC

SECTION: Editorial; Pg. 12A

LENGTH: 689 words

Fueled by a series of horrific crimes in which victims were targeted because of
their race, religion or sexual orientation, Georgia lawmakers have joined the
growing campaign to toughen penalties for such crimes.

The states' efforts range from Indiana lawmakers' plans to keep statistics on
crimes motivated by bias to Kansas legislation that would allow a district judge
to double the sentence for someone who committed a crime because of the victim's
race, gender, disability or other characteristics.

Illinois legislators, with tough hate crimes laws already on their books, want
to prosecute leaders of groups who may have encouraged but didn't participate in
a hate crime.

West Virginia is considering expanding its hate crimes legislation to include
crimes committed against people because of their sexual orientation or
disability.

California Gov. Gray Davis wants to expand the definition of a hate crime, add
three years to the sentence of a felon convicted of a crime motivated by hatred
and extend the one-year hate crimes statute of limitation to three years.

In Minnesota, lawmakers are considering expanding hate crimes laws to include
third-degree arson and riot, interfering with a religious observance, trespass,
civil disorder, public nuisance, disorderly conduct, obscene or harassing
telephone calls and harassing letters, telegrams and packages.

Georgia is one of 10 states without hate crimes laws; previous attempts to enact
them failed. But Sen. Vincent Fort (D-Atlanta), citing church burnings in 47 of
Georgia's 159 counties, is sponsoring a bill that would remedy that, and then
some.

Fort's legislation would tack on up to five years to the sentence of a felon
convicted of a crime motivated by a victim's "actual or perceived race, color,
religion, national origin, ancestry, ethnicity, gender, disability or sexual
orientation of the victim or any person associated with the victim." In the case
of a misdemeanor, it would increase fines by up to 50 percent.

"This is our most important civil rights legislation this year," says Fort of
his bill, called the Anti-Domestic Terrorism Act. (Fort likens hate crimes to
terrorism.) "Not only is it good civil rights law, but it's good law-and- order
legislation."

Opposition to Fort's bill already has led to one amendment. His original bill
would have allowed a judge to determine whether the crime is a hate crime. But
Macon Superior Court Judge Phillip Brown had warned senators of "a
constitutional problem with asking a judge rather than a jury to determine
intent of a defendant." The House Judiciary Committee then changed the bill to
allow a jury to make the determination.

But Republicans haven't been won over, and they plan to fight the bill on the
House floor. Among their reservations are that the legislation would punish
people for their thoughts and make hatred a crime. Others point out that there
are already laws to cover every category of crime; they say hate crimes laws are
unnecessary and would muddy the waters of a rational criminal justice system.

Sen. Billy Ray (R-Lawrenceville), whose father was murdered in 1976, says the
legislation wouldn't cover his father's slaying and argues that Fort's bill
would create two tiers of victims.

"I'm against the bill because we're providing protection for some citizens, but
not for others," Ray said.

Though American Civil Liberties Union chapters in other states have raised
questions about the constitutionality of such legislation --- whether it
violates First Amendment rights --- Georgia's ACLU chapter says it has decided
not to take a position on the bill.

But executive director Debbie Seagraves said this week, "We would oppose any
bill that has clear restrictions on hate speech, and we would oppose any bill
that did not include sexual orientation as a category."

Let us hear from you

Does Georgia need to differentiate between hate crimes and other crimes?

Should penalties be tougher if a crime is determined to be motivated by hate?

Can Georgia enact enhanced penalties for hate crimes and still ensure equal
justice under the law?

Recent hate crimes
Three white men were convicted last year of offering a ride to James Byrd of
Jasper, Texas, a black man, then chaining him behind a pickup truck and dragging
him to his death.
White supremacist Benjamin Smith went on a two-state shooting rampage on July
Fourth weekend in 1999. In the Chicago area, he killed former Northwestern
University basketball coach Ricky Byrdsong, who was black, and injured six
Orthodox Jews. He fired at Asians and blacks in three other Illinois cities,
wounding three people. He killed an Asian student in Bloomington, Ind., before
killing himself.
In Laramie, Wyo., Matthew Shepard, 21, a gay student, died after he was
kidnapped, robbed, beaten and tied to a fence post on the Wyoming prairie in
freezing weather. Aaron McKinney, 22, one of those convicted in his death,
blamed "gay panic."
In California, white supremacist Buford O. Furrow has been charged in an August
shooting spree that left a Filipino-American mailman dead and injured five
people at a Jewish community center.
In Fort Worth, Texas, last September, a gunman spouting anti-Baptist rhetoric
burst into a church service and started shooting. Larry Gene Ashbrook killed
seven people before committing suicide.
 Last week, in the Pittsburgh suburb of Wilkinsburg, a black man gunned down
five white men --- killing three and injuring two. The suspect, Ronald Taylor,
39, reportedly said, ''I'm just out to shoot white people.''

Killer Denied a New Hearing


A Baltimore Circuit Court judge rejected another last-minute attempt yesterday
to delay the execution of convicted murderer Tyrone D. Gilliam.

Judge John Grason Turnbull III denied Gilliam a new hearing, saying he had used
up all chances to appeal. Gilliam is scheduled to be executed next week for the
1989 murder and robbery of Christine Doerfler, 21, a hardware store clerk from
suburban Baltimore.

Gilliam's attorney said yesterday that he would appeal Turnbull's decision to
the state Court of Appeals this morning. In the meantime, Gilliam asked Gov.
Parris N. Glendening yesterday for a stay of execution, but the governor's
office did not immediately release a decision.

Attorney Jerome H. Nickerson Jr. said he would not file a request for clemency
with Glendening until he had exhausted all means of appeal in the courts.

Gilliam would be the third inmate executed in Maryland since the state
reinstated the death penalty in 1978.


Property Crime Down in Howard


Howard County police reported sharp declines yesterday in property crime and in
most categories of violent crime in the first nine months of the year compared
with the same period last year.

Quarterly crime statistics show declines in the numbers of burglaries, car
thefts and other property crimes ranging from 17.3 to 20.5 percent from January
through September, compared with the same period last year. The figures
underscore a trend of steadily dropping property crime in the wealthy suburb of
232,000 people.

As for violent crime, police reported one more rape in the first nine months of
this year compared with the same period in 1997, bringing the total this year to
28. Howard has had three homicides in 1998, compared with one in the first three
quarters of the previous year, but all have been solved. The number of robberies
and aggravated assaults dropped more than 10 percent.


VIRGINIA


3 Charged With Snatching Wallets


Three D.C. residents suspected of stealing wallets from elderly women in Fairfax
County grocery stores have been arrested and charged with larceny and fraud,
police said yesterday.

From January until October, two pickpockets repeatedly worked a scam in which a
woman would approach an elderly shopper and ask for help reading a label. While
the customer was trying to help, a man would take the wallet from her purse and
walk away, Fairfax police said.

"The women wouldn't know until they got up to the checkout counter to pay," said
Officer Katie Hughes, a police spokeswoman.

Police said that Sandra V. Walker, 45, of the 900 block of Ingraham Street NW,
started the ruse and that Wayne A. Jones, 40, of the same address, lifted the
wallets. Both were arrested outside a grocery store Oct. 23 and charged with
five counts of credit card theft, two counts of grand larceny and four counts of
petit larceny.

Jones also was charged with two counts of credit card fraud. Both are being held
in the Fairfax County jail.

A third alleged participant, Stanley T. Hairston, 48, of the 5100 block of
Illinois Avenue NW, was charged with one count of grand larceny and one count of
credit card theft. Police say he was the getaway driver in several of the
thefts.


A Guilty Plea in Bribery Case


A former supervisor at the Federal Highway Administration was sentenced
yesterday to a 37-month prison term after admitting that he solicited and
received more than $ 150,000 in bribes from government contractors.

Alberto Santiago, 41, of Herndon, oversaw millions of dollars in federal highway
administration contracts, prosecutors said. Besides the prison sentence, U.S.
District Judge Stanley Harris ordered Santiago to pay a $ 5,000 fine and spend
three years on probation upon his release.

Santiago pleaded guilty to charges of bribery, conspiracy and money laundering.
Prosecutors said he accepted bribes between 1993 and 1997 from contractors who
then got favorable treatment. Two contractors also have pleaded guilty to
federal charges stemming from the investigation by the FBI and U.S. Department
of Transportation's inspector general's office.

'Brutalized' public lives with growing fear / Problem centralized in the cities

BYLINE: Sam Vincent Meddis

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 6A

LENGTH: 1706 words


A 4-year-old in Washington, D.C., is caught in a deadly barrage of bullets.
Florida tourists are senselessly shot to death. Motorists pulled from their
cars, run over if they resist.

Each new, highly publicized incident helps reinforce the public sense that crime
is spiraling out of control.

Is the fear justified?

The FBI says the rate of violent crime reports to police has soared nearly 19%
over the past five years, enough to stir new fears.

But that may oversimplify things: Suburbs remain safer than people think,
criminologists say, while cities may be even more crime-ridden than the numbers
show.

In essence, "crime is very heavily centralized in the inner cities," says
Patrick Murphy, former New York City police commissioner who now heads a police
policy committee with the U.S. Conference of Mayors.

A new USA TODAY/CNN/Gallup survey however, indicates the fear goes beyond that:

Nearly four in 10 say they frequently worry about themselves or family being
sexually assaulted or raped.

Up to one in three frequently worry about their homes being burglarized.

More than one in four fear being mugged.

In most categories, blacks express more fear than whites. Nearly 28% of blacks
say they frequently worried about being murdered, compared with 18% of whites.

"You got the perceptions right," says Nolan Jones, top criminal justice
specialist with the National Governors' Association. "Violent crime is up - the
kind of crime that upsets people a lot more than anything else."

But for suburban and rural residents, some of the fear is exaggerated, an
outgrowth of the constant bombardment of sensational news stories about crime,
Jones says.

"People who live outside the city worry about crime inside the city," he says.

The FBI's annual crime report, released earlier this month, found violent crime
in cities grew less than 1% last year, compared with a 6% increase in rural
areas and a 2% rise in suburbs.

But cities remain much more dangerous: The rate of violent crimes reported to
police in major cities last year was 1,802 per 100,000 population - nearly four
times the suburban rate and eight times the rural rate.

And a U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics report in August found that major
violent crimes (including rape, robbery and aggravated assault):

Hit nearly 4% of families with incomes under $ 7,500, compared with about 2% of
families with incomes of $ 50,000 or more.

Hit nearly 4% of urban households; about 2% of suburban and rural households.

Hit nearly 5% of black households; 2% of whites.

If anything, recent studies may understate the seriousness of crime in America's
inner cities.

The BJS report doesn't include homicides or crimes against businesses and some
members of the underclass, such as the homeless.

Moreover, demoralized inner-city residents may no longer call the police to
report crime.

"In some places people have become so brutalized they don't even report it
anymore," says Temple University criminologist James Fyfe.

Within cities themselves, crime rates vary.

In New York, for example, the murder rate in a low-income precinct has
registered as much as 90 times higher than the rate in an upscale precinct,
Murphy says.

Still, crime fears tend to gather close to home, the poll finds. Fully 43% of
respondents said there was more crime in their own neighborhoods than there was
a year ago. Only 17% thought there was less.

Also, 43% said there were areas within a mile of their homes where they'd be
afraid to walk alone at night.

A city like Washington, D.C., where Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly recently called for
the National Guard, typifies how crime problems isolated in specific areas can
cast a pall over the entire city, says Jones.

President Clinton refused to call out the Guard himself, but said he would
support legislation granting Kelly such authority.

"The mayor made it seem as if the whole city is under siege," Jones says. "The
whole city was not under siege."

Yet George Washington University sociologist Amitai Etzioni says the general
public is "damned right" to fear increased crime even if much of it is focused
in poor areas.

Open-air drug markets are chilling reminders that there are areas beyond the
control of legal authorities, like the expanses between feudal cities where
outlaws once roamed free, Etzioni says. "The purpose of the modern state was to
avoid that."

Middle-class citizens entering urban areas no longer feel safe about such
mundane things as parking their cars in garages and taking elevators to their
offices, Etzioni says.

It's a Bonfire of the Vanities kind of fear - the dread that one might be in the
wrong place at the worst possible time and become the victim of "scary . . . new
forms of crime" such as carjackings and drive-by shootings, Etzioni says.

The Kerner Commission's warning after the urban riots of the 1960s - that the
nation was moving toward two "separate and unequal" societies - seems even more
dire today, experts say.

"Places that have always been bad have gotten much, much worse," says Fyfe.
"It's the Kerner Commission come true. It's horrendous."

Perception: Crime rate rising Property crimes dropped last year, and violent
crimes leveled off for the first time since 1987. But a USA TODAY/CNN/Gallup
poll shows most Americans think the nation's crime problem continues to worsen.
On the other hand, they don't see crime worsening in their own neighborhoods.
The poll results:

Vast majority says there is more crime in the USA than a year
ago, as has been the case for several years:
1989 84%
1990 84%
1992 89%
 Now   87%
  Suburban   91%

Urban      83%

... though fewer than half see more crime than a year ago in their neighborhood.
More       43%
Less       17%
Same       37%
No answer   3%

According to the FBI, violent crime is up, property crime is down:
Crimes per 100,000 population
             Violent crime         Property crime
1980               597                  5,353

their home where they would be afraid to walk at night:

Gay Man Dies From Attack, Fanning Outrage and Debate

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

SECTION: Section A; Page 1; Column 1; National Desk

LENGTH: 1318 words

DATELINE: FORT COLLINS, Colo., Oct. 12


Matthew Shepard, the gay college student who was kidnapped, robbed and
pistol-whipped, died here today, five days after he was rescued from a Wyoming
ranch where he had been left tied to a fence for 18 hours in near-freezing
temperatures.

His death, announced at the Poudre Valley Hospital here, fanned the outrage that
followed word of the attack, spawning vigils, producing calls for Federal hate-
crimes legislation from President Clinton and fueling debates over such laws in
a host of Western states, including Wyoming, that have resisted them.

In places from Denver to the University of Maryland, people turned out to mourn
the soft-spoken 21-year-old who became an overnight symbol of deadly violence
against gay people after he was found dangling from the fence by a passerby.

Russell A. Henderson, 21, and Aaron J. McKinney, 22, were charged with attempted
murder and are expected to face first-degree murder charges that could bring the
death penalty. Their girlfriends, Chasity V. Pasley, 20, and Kristen L. Price,
18, were charged as accessories.

In Denver, mourners wrote messages on a graffiti wall as part of national Gay
Awareness Week. In San Francisco, the giant rainbow flag that symbolizes the gay
rights movement was lowered to half-staff in the Castro district.

"There is incredible symbolism about being tied to a fence," said Rebecca
Isaacs, political director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force in
Washington. "People have likened it to a scarecrow. But it sounded more like a
crucifixion."

The Laramie police have said they believe robbery was the primary motive for the
attack, which occurred outside a bar. But investigators also said Mr. Shepard's
sexual orientation was a factor. They said the suspects lured Mr. Shepard from
the bar by saying they, too, were gay, and one of the women said Mr. Shepard had
embarrassed one of the men by making a pass at him, the investigators said.

Today, the Laramie police said that after leaving Mr. Shepard tied to the fence,
the men returned to Laramie and picked a fight on a street corner with two
Hispanic men, Emiliano Morales 3d, 19, and Jeremy Herrera, 18. Mr. McKinney and
Mr. Morales suffered head injuries.

Gay leaders hope that Mr. Shepard's death will galvanize Congress and state
legislatures to pass hate-crime legislation or broaden existing laws.
Conservatives, particularly Christian conservatives, generally oppose such laws,
saying they extend to minorities "special rights."

In the last two decades, 21 states and the District of Columbia have passed laws
that increase penalties for crimes that are committed because of race, religion,
color, national origin and sexual orientation.

Another 19 states, including Colorado, do not include sexual orientation in
their hate-crime laws. Ten states, including Wyoming, have no hate-crime laws,
or none based on specific categories.

In Washington, Mr. Clinton responded to news of Mr. Shepard's death by urging
Congress to pass the Federal Hate Crimes Protection Act, which would make
Federal offenses of crimes based on sex, disability and sexual orientation.

"Congress needs to pass our tough hate-crimes legislation," Mr. Clinton said.
Current law covers only crimes based on race, color, religion or national
origin.

Wyoming has been a holdout, rejecting three hate-crimes bills since 1994, most
recently in February. But today, after the death of Mr. Shepard, who was a
University of Wyoming freshman, Jim Geringer, the state's popular Governor,
opened the door to legislation at a news conference. "I ask for a collective
suggestion for anti-bias, anti-hate legislation that can be presented to the
Wyoming Legislature for their consideration in January," he said.

The Governor met this morning with Dennis Shepard, Matthew's father, and said
the father did not want the death to become "a media circus" and that "we should
not use Matt to further an agenda."

Mr. Geringer said that Dennis Shepard also said: "Don't rush into just passing
all kinds of new hate-crimes laws. Be very careful of any changes and be sure
you're not taking away rights of others in the process to race to this."

Leaders of gay rights groups interviewed today said they would respect the
family's privacy by not attending the burial in Casper, Wyo., on Saturday. But
they added they hoped the death would have an impact.

"Matthew's death, I hope, will bring about a better and deeper understanding of
hate-crime laws," said Elizabeth Birch, executive director of the Human Rights
Campaign, a lesbian and gay rights group that has 250,000 members.

In 1996, 21 men and women were killed in the United States because of their
sexual orientation, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, an Alabama
group that tracks violence against minorities. According to the Federal Bureau
of Investigation, sexual orientation was a factor in 11.6 percent of the 8,759
hate crimes recorded in 1996.

But Christian conservatives warn that gay leaders want to use today's death to
expand hate-crime laws and curtail freedom of speech.

"Hate-crimes laws have nothing to do with perpetrators of violent crime and
everything to do with silencing political opposition," said Steven A. Schwalm,
an analyst with the Family Research Council, a Washington group dedicated to
defending "faith, family and freedom."

"It would criminalize pro-family beliefs," Mr. Schwalm said. "This basically
sends a message that you can't disagree with the political message of homosexual
activists."

Agreement came from John Paulk, who was featured this summer in advertisements
about how he and his wife, Anne, "overcame" homosexuality through religion.

"We have every right to speak out against an agenda that is contrary to Biblical
norms," said Mr. Paulk, who describes himself as a homosexuality specialist for
Focus on the Family, a Christian group in Colorado Springs. "Because we are
standing up and opposing the homosexual agenda, we are being looked upon as
advocating violence against homosexuals, when we categorically reject violence
against homosexuals."

Last Thursday, the Family Research Council unveiled a series of television
advertisements that preach the "healing" of homosexuality through religious
conversion. Gay leaders charge that these advertisements help create a hostile
climate for homosexuals, a climate that can lead to violence.

Hate-crime laws on the books in 40 states have not impinged on freedom of
speech, said Brian Levin, a criminal justice professor who directs the Center on
Hate and Extremism at Stockton College, in Pomona, N.J.

"We want to deter the broken windows and simple assaults before they escalate,"
he said.

Mr. Levin said that his research indicated that homosexuals suffered higher
rates of violent crime than the population at large. He said that roughly half
of the people who attack homosexuals are male, age 22 or under.

"With other crimes, violence is a means to an end; with hate crimes, the
violence becomes an unstoppable goal," Mr. Levin said.

Mr. Shepard suffered a dozen cuts to his head, face and neck, as well as a
massive, and ultimately fatal, blow to the back of his skull.

While some gay leaders saw crucifiction imagery in Mr. Shepard's death, others
saw a different symbolism: the Old West practice of nailing a dead coyote to a
ranch fence as a warning to future intruders.

"This University of Wyoming student was beaten and left to die, tied to a fence
like an animal because he was honest and open about being gay," Beatrice Dohrn,
legal director of the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, said today.
"Matthew Shepard's horrible suffering and death cannot be dismissed simply as
the fault of deranged, isolated individuals," Ms. Dohrn said. "His attackers are
among millions of Americans who constantly hear the message that gay people are
not worthy of the most basic equal treatment."

U.S. APPEALS JUDGE DENOUNCES REAGAN CRIME-FIGHTING IDEAS

BYLINE: Special to the New York Times

SECTION: Section 1; Part 1; Page 33, Column 1; National Desk

LENGTH: 407 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 13


Judge David L. Bazelon, an influential member of the United States Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia, has criticized the Reagan Administration's
proposals for fighting crime as ineffective.

In a speech at Vanderbilt University in Nashville Friday, he said that the
Administration's strategy ignored clear evidence that poverty bred crime and
would endanger civil liberties.

An effective attack on ''the roots of crime,'' Judge Bazelon said, might require
a repressive police state ''akin to martial law'' or acceptance of reforms
amounting to ''a revolution in the way we govern ourselves.''

Judge Bazelon has been a member of the court 32 years, for many years as chief
judge. He is widely known for his liberal opinions, from advocating more
enlightened treatment of insane people who commit crimes to seeking enforcement
of Federal environmental regulations.

'Stark Realities' Ignored

Judge Bazelon said that the President's speech on crime in New Orleans last fall
ignored ''stark realities'' underlying violent crime. He also took issue with
Presidential assertions that ''it's obvious that deprivation and want don't
necessarily increase crime'' and that people commit violent crimes because they
have ''chosen to live'' that way.

''Only the blind or the willful can deny the clear association of this kind of
crime with the culture of poverty and discrimination still tolerat ed in every
American city,'' The judge said.  ''From my experience, I would warrant that
more than 90 percent of the defendants in prosecutions for violent street crimes
come from the bottom of the socioeconomic ladder.''

''They are invariably born into families struggling to survive, if they have
families at all,'' he continued. ''They are raised in deteriorating, overcrowded
housing. They are subjected to prejudice and educated in unresponsive schools.
With nothing to preserve and nothing to lose, they turn to crime for economic
survival, a sense of excitement and accomplishment, and an outlet for
frustration, desperation and rage.''

Judge Bazelon questioned the Reagan proposals for reduced procedural protections
for criminal defendants and tougher sentencing. He said that studies show that
''only 6 percent of serious crime results in arrest.''

LESSON IN U.S. CRIME;
 DETECTIVE IN MOB CITY

BYLINE: Mark Cowan MEAN STREETS: Chicago

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 9

LENGTH: 361 words


A SENIOR Birmingham detective is in America's Windy City swapping ideas on
tackling serious crime and explosive street protests.

Det Chief Insp Ellie Bird is spending time with Chicago police - the city once
ruled by mobster Al Capone - to look at their successful crime-fighting
initiatives.

Her trip coincides with a major trans-Atlantic business conference expected to
attract hundreds of anti-capitalist protesters.

Det Chief Insp Bird, from Steelhouse Lane police, said it would give her a
crucial insight into policing large-scale demonstrations.

Similar anti-capitalist demonstrations in cities, such as Seattle, have erupted
into violence. 'We have had similar demonstrations in Birmingham city centre and
it will be useful to see if we can learn anything from how the Chicago police
deal with them,' she said.

'Although there are differences in the size and make-up of our cities, I know
this will also be a good opportunity for us to exchange ideas on how we deal
with crime.

'I will be passing on information about how we, in central Birmingham, have been
able to reduce street crime in the city centre and the ways in which we work
with other agencies to reduce and prevent crime.

'I am sure the police in Chicago will have similarly successful ways of reducing
crime which I can bring back to Birmingham.'

In the prohibition era, Chicago earned itself the unenviable reputation as being
one of the most violent cities in America as Capone ruled the illegal liquor
market through fear and corruption.

Birmingham's sister city is now bucking rising crime trends across the States
with a ten-year decrease in recorded crime.

It is hoped successful community ideas introduced by Chicago Police Supt Terry G
Hillard could be adopted by police in Birmingham.

These are the latest crime figures for the two cities for the last six months:

West Midlands

Robbery: down 16 per cent

Car crime: down 4.3 per cent

Burglary: down 4.3 per cent

Violent crime: down 2.5 per cent

Chicago

Robbery: down 1 per cent

Car crime: down 4 per cent

Burglary: down 1 per cent

FBI REPORT: VIOLENT AND PROPERTY CRIME DOWN;
Some community flare-ups defy statistics

SECTION: ; Pg. Z3

LENGTH: 326 words


Crime scene tape hangs where a 23-year-old man was shot and killed over the
Labor Day weekend in Chicago.

WASHINGTON Overall violent crime and property offenses declined slightly last
year across much of the country, continuing a downward trajectory even as some
communities battled disparate surges in violence, according to a new FBI report.

Robbery recorded the largest decline at 5.6%, and murder was down 0.5% in 2014,
but rape and aggravated assault ticked up 2.4% and 2%, respectively, the report
found. Property offenses dropped in each category: Burglary was down 10.5%,
larceny-theft declined by nearly 3% and vehicle thefts declined by 1.5%.

The FBI report comes as some cities confront troubling increases in violence,
prompting the Justice Department to call a meeting next month of law enforcement
authorities "to explore what measures are working," Deputy Attorney General
Sally Yates said Monday.

"We have witnessed a remarkable drop in crime since the 1980s, both violent
crime and crime overall," Yates said. "Entire cities have been transformed,
unlocking tremendous potential and releasing a wave of prosperity. But despite
these successes, we know it's not true everywhere. There are still neighborhoods
- far too many neighborhoods - where bloodshed has become a fact of life."

Yates' remarks in Detroit came while announcing an expansion of the federal
Violence Reduction Network to include five more cities where violent crime has
increased at a rate above the national average: Compton, Calif.; Flint, Mich.;
Little Rock; West Memphis, Ark.; and Newark, N.J. The program, launched last
year in Camden, N.J.; Wilmington, Del.; Detroit; Chicago; and the
Oakland-Richmond, Calif., area, provides communities with access to federal law
enforcement resources to assist local agencies.

In Flint, where homicide is up nearly 70% this year, Police Chief James W.
Tolbert said the violence is commonly related to domestic abuse, drugs and
robbery.

May 25--A former president of Pueblo Crime Stoppers was recently named as vice
chairman for Crime Stoppers USA.

John Koncilja III, who served as president of the local Crime Stoppers from
October 2012 through October 2014 and has served as a regional director for
Crime Stoppers USA since 2013, said he learned he was appointed to vice chairman
of the national Crime Stoppers Wednesday.

Koncilja was nominated by the Crime Stoppers USA board, which consists of 30
members.

In his role as vice chairman, Koncilja said he will be responsible for various
committees as well as managing all of the Crime Stopper USA regional directors.

Koncilja, who lives in Pueblo, said being ap- pointed to this position is a real
honor for him.

"I think the excitement comes from the fact that it's a great organization. It's
a well-established organization that obviously does good work," he said. We're
out there to assist and support law enforcement and make all of our communities
a better place to live. "

Koncilja said there is a lot he hopes to accomplish in his new role.

"I think the thing I look forward to accomplishing is ensuring that policies and
systems are in place to have longevity in the organization and make sure it's
running well for a long time," he said.

SERIOUS CRIME ROSE 8 PCT. IN CITY LAST YEAR< / NATIONWIDE, HOWEVER, REPORTS OF
SERIOUS CRIME FELL BY< 2 PERCENT. THE GOOD NEWS FOR PHILADELPHIA? CAR THEFT< WAS
DOWN, AND 115 CITIES HAD A HIGHER CRIME RATE.

BYLINE: Rita Giordano and Tom Torok, INQUIRER STAFF WRITERS

SECTION: LOCAL; Pg. A01

LENGTH: 729 words


While serious crime dropped around the country last year, especially in the
largest cities, Philadelphia became more murderous and more violent, and theft
went up, too, according to statistics made public yesterday by the FBI.

Reported serious crime nationwide fell by 2 percent in 1995, and in cities with
more than a million people, the drop was 6 percent, according to the FBI's
preliminary Uniform Crime Reporting Program.

But in Philadelphia, the nation's fifth-largest city, reports of serious crime
increased 8 percent: the rates for homicide, robbery and rape each went up 7
percent; aggravated assault increased 5 percent; and burglary and larceny both
went up 15 percent.

The figures - which were calculated using the most recent numbers available,
1995 crime statistics and 1994 population figures - are a reversal in the trend
this decade generally showing a decline of major crime in Philadelphia.

Yet, despite the spike in crime, Philadelphia was not even close to the top of
the list of dangerous American cities.

Of the 199 cities surveyed by the FBI, Las Vegas was No. 1, with a crime rate of
18,354 per 100,000 people. Atlanta, readying to welcome people from all over the
world as host of the Summer Olympics, had the dubious achievement of ranking
second. Sun-drenched Honolulu was third.

Philadelphia, by comparison, ranked 116th, with 7,104 crimes per 100,000 people.
That ratio made Philadelphia safer than Los Angeles, which ranked 100th, but not
as safe as New York City. The Big Apple ranked 144th, with 6,180 crimes per
100,000 people and an overall decrease of 15 percent in reported crime.

Police Commissioner Richard Neal suggested that the FBI statistics may indicate
some positive things. Community policing, for one thing, has made it easier for
people to report crime, he said.

Neal did, however, concede that the statistics reflect the cyclical nature of
crime and crime trends.

"To some extent," Neal said, "[the report] does reflect some increase in crime."

The commissioner said his department planned to use federal money to hire
additional officers and beef up patrols between 6 p.m. and 2 a.m. to help meet
the challenge of increased crime rates.

That said, however, the new numbers aren't likely to be comforting to many
Philadelphians.

The only good news was the motor-vehicle theft rate dropped 6 percent, the same
as the national average. (By way of travel advisory, Newark, N.J., has the
highest auto-theft rate, as well as the highest ranking for robbery.) Arson fell
6 percent, a little better than the national average but not enough to get
Philadelphia out of the top 10 nationally.

The bad news was just about everything else.

Homicide went up 7 percent, compared with a decrease of 8 percent nationwide.
Philadelphia ranked 24th in homicides of the cities surveyed. That's a distance
from New Orleans, which seems to be murder rate capital of the nation, or
Baltimore, which tied for eighth. Still, Philadelphia's homicide rate was higher
than, say, Houston, which ranked 49th, or New York City, which ranked 66th.

Philadelphia also showed increases in other major crimes. Rape went up 7
percent, compared with a 6 percent decline nationwide. Robbery also saw a 7
percent increase, compared with a 7 percent fall around the country. Aggravated
assault increased 5 percent here, but dropped 3 percent nationally. Burglary and
larceny both went up 15 percent, compared with a 5 percent burglary decline and
a 1 percent larceny increase elsewhere.

As unpleasant as the numbers may sound, James Fyfe, a professor of criminal
justice at Temple University, offered some cautions.

"I would not use [the FBI numbers] as a measure of the success or failure of the
Police Department," Fyfe said.

For one thing, he noted, the numbers are reported crimes, which tend to
fluctuate, rather than actual crime, which is much harder to measure. The most
accurately reported of the various categories are vehicle theft and homicide.
"People are concerned about their insurance, and with murder, usually there's a
body," he said.

As Neal suggested, the increases may even say something good about the Police
Department.

"An increase in the crime rates could mean [the public] has more faith in the
police," Fyfe said.

"Or," he added, "obviously, it could mean we're not doing very well."

Violent crime on rise in U.S., study finds: Dallas, Detroit top danger list
while New York is safest among large cities

BYLINE: Steven Edwards, CanWest News Service

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A7

LENGTH: 548  words

DATELINE: NEW YORK


NEW YORK - The United States became a more dangerous place in 2005, with more
murders, robberies and aggravated assaults leading the largest annual rise in
the violent crime rate since 2001, the FBI reported Monday.

The number of murder victims exceeded 16,900 while there were at least 92,837
forcible rapes and almost 420,000 robberies.

Among big U.S. cities, Dallas emerged as the most dangerous, with economically
depressed Detroit a close second, while New York again enjoyed being dubbed the
safest.

Experts differed on whether the statistics show the United States to be
significantly more dangerous than Canada, with one leading scholar arguing most
crime rates are similar except for homicide.

"The U.S. is higher in gun crime, but Canada has higher burglary rates, it has
higher theft rates, it has equivalent assault rates: it is a high-crime
society," said Marcus Felson, professor at the School of Criminal Justice of
Rutgers University in Newark, N.J.

"Western Canada is a very high crime society, while Eastern Canada is moderate
like New York, but that's partly for the wrong reason, namely it is too cold in
winter to commit much crime."

Statistics Canada will release Canada's 2005 crime statistics next month, but
annually warns against comparing them with the FBI list because the Canadian
roundup considers a greater number of violent offences.

The murder rate in the United States shot up 4.8 per cent last year, marking the
highest percentage increase in 15 years. The robbery rate rose 4.5 per cent, but
the number of forcible rapes reported dipped by 1.9 per cent.

The overall trend bucks a general decline throughout the 1990s, but individual
spikes are explainable.

For example, the arrival in Houston of thousands of people fleeing hurricane
Katrina-ravaged New Orleans -- long known as a high crime city -- could have
contributed to the 23-per-cent rise in the Texas city's murder rate, to 334 from
272.

"When new teenagers show up, they upset the pecking order," said Felson, whose
latest book, Crime and Nature, explores crime's symbiotic relationships with
society's legal activities.

Rapidly growing Las Vegas saw a 10-per-cent increase in its murder rate, to 144
from 131, but continued economic decline accompanied a 14-per-cent rise in the
number of murders in Philadelphia, where there were 377 victims, up from 330.

"Philadelphia has more abandoned property than any city in America, and
Baltimore is second," said Felson. "So you have whole areas of the city that are
like a war zone. Not only is abandoned property used for crime, but there is no
one living and working there to look after the street."

The now-cooling housing boom and rising property prices meant developers snapped
up abandoned property in many other cities.

"Redevelopment was most marked in New York: Times Square was once a generator of
crime, but that is no longer the case," Felson said.

More than 12,000 law enforcement agencies submitted reports to the FBI for the
survey.

In New York, Mayor Michael Bloomberg credited the continued fall in the violent
crime rate to tougher policing and his drive to get illegal guns off the
streets. The entire Northeast showed the least marked rise in violent crime,
contrasting sharply with the Midwest, where there was an overall 5.7 per cent
increase.

Following brief holiday, criminals back at work

BYLINE: By PAUL SLOCA; Associated Press Writer

SECTION: NATION; Pg. A5

LENGTH: 489 words


Criminals are back at work in many American cities after a brief lull following
the terrorist attacks.

"You've got to understand that some people do this for a living," said Officer
Rick Eckhard of the St. Louis County, Mo., Police Department. "The president
said go back and do what you do for a living, and since that's what they do,
they're back doing it."

Cities like Kansas City, Mo., Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and Hartford, Conn.,
reported a slowdown in crime on Sept. 11 and in the days after. Many police
departments did not have hard numbers but said the drop was modest in most
places.

"That week it appeared that things did slow down somewhat," said Kansas City
police spokesman Steve Young. "We're assuming that everybody was at home
watching television, even criminals and potential victims."

But the trend didn't last long in many places.

"Crime goes on," said John Turner, a spokesman for the Sheriff's Office in
Jacksonville, Fla., which also had a modest and short-lived drop in crime. "The
criminals are going to do what they do."

On Tuesday, New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani cited statistics showing that
violent crime had plunged in the two weeks since the attacks. During the week of
the attacks, violent crime was down 17.5 percent compared with the same period a
year ago, and officials attributed the drop in part to stepped-up police
efforts. New York had four homicides last week, versus 10 in the same week last
year.

Boston police spokeswoman Mariellen Burns said 1,514 crimes were reported from
the day of the attacks through Sept. 15, compared with 1,609 during the same
time a year ago. Burns said she had no more recent figures.

In Philadelphia, Police Commissioner John F. Timoney said the crime rate has not
changed since the attacks, but bomb threats are up. "Some whack jobs are out
there calling these stupid things in," Timoney said. "We know it's a prank but
still we've got to treat it seriously."

There is no easy way to determine why crime drops during a crisis, said John
Galliher, a professor of sociology at the University of Missouri at Columbia.
"I'd like to be able to tell you that criminals are patriotic and would stop
committing crimes," he said, "but I can't tell you that."

John Kilburn, an assistant professor of criminology and sociology at Eastern
Connecticut State University in Windham, Conn., noted that some crime rates
dropped during World War II, with the murder level declining to about half of
what it was during the Depression.

"Our aggressions are no longer on our neighbors, our partners or the guy next to
us at the bar," Kilburn said.

In Hartford, which had been coping with one of its highest homicide rates in
years, crime was down dramatically following the attacks, though police said
they had no hard numbers.

"The whole mood on the street is very subdued, even among the drug dealers and
criminal element," said police Capt. Mark Pawlina.

NATION'S MURDER RATE MAY BE BOTTOMING OUT

BYLINE: By SCOTT SHIFREL SPECIAL TO EXPRESS

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 4

LENGTH: 311 words

While crime across the nation continued an eight-year decline, experts say a
drop in murders may have finally reached its low point.

Newly released FBI crime statistics for 1999 show that while the national
homicide rate was the lowest in 33 years, the number of murders in New York City
went up, from 633 in 1998 to 671.

And criminologists said the trend is likely to continue in big cities across the
country.

"The big cities are reaching their limit" in crime reduction, said Prof. James
Alan Fox of Northeastern University in Boston. Alfred Blumstein of Carnegie
Mellon University in Pittsburgh said big cities are the best barometers of how
well the war against crime is going.

"The big cities were the first to go up in the 1980s, the first to come down in
the 1990s," he said. "Now, having the lowest murder rate decline suggests
they'll be the first to stabilize.

Although the murder rate across the nation was the lowest since 1966 - 5.7 per
100,000 in 1999 - big cities with more than 1 million residents saw only a 4%
drop, to 13 per 100,000.

Nationally, last year marked the eighth straight year that serious crime
dropped, including rapes, robberies and assaults.

The statistics closely matched those in New York City, where serious crime in
1999 was down 8.4% from 1998, according to New York Police Department
statistics. As of Oct. 8, serious crime in the city was down 5.34% this year,
the department's numbers show.

The newest FBI statistics also revealed:

A 7% drop of serious crimes from 1998.

Violent crime, at 525 murders, rapes, robberies and assaults for every 100,000
residents, was at a 21-year low.

Statewide, New York also saw decreases in crime, with a 9% decline between 1998
and 1999 in the number of "index crimes," which include serious crimes such as
murder and rape as well as nonviolent crimes, like burglary.

NATION IN BRIEF;
U.S. colleges described as 'armed camps'

BYLINE: From news services

SECTION: NATIONAL NEWS; Pg. 11A

LENGTH: 880 words


U.S. college campuses are havens from much of the violent and property crime
that afflicts the nation. One expert says that's because they have become "armed
camps."

In its first study of campus law enforcement, the Justice Department reported in
Washington Wednesday that three out of four college and university campuses now
employ police officers with arrest power.

"The reason the campus crime rates are so low is that colleges and universities
have recruited huge numbers of security personnel to protect students," said
Jack Levin, a professor of criminology and sociology at Northeastern University.

The department's Bureau of Justice Statistics found that there were 64 violent
crimes and 2,141 property crimes reported to police for every 100,000 students
in 1994, the most recent year with complete data. By comparison, in the nation
as a whole that year, there were 716 violent crimes and 4,656 property crimes
for every 100,000 residents.

CRIME Sergeant jailed

An Army sergeant with a pocket full of fake IDs was jailed on charges he bluffed
his way into the sheriff's department in Phoenix and fondle two female prisoners
who say they still don't know his real name. David Michael Pecard was arrested
last week and charged on Wednesday with fraud, forgery, theft and sexual abuse.
A second allegation of sexual abuse remains under investigation. He was jailed
on $ 2 million bond. Authorities said Pecard, 34, at times claimed to be an FBI
agent, a U.S. Marshal and a Defense Department investigator. More recently, he
conned his way into the Maricopa County Sheriff's Department, receiving the keys
and an office and scamming Joe Arpaio, the man who enjoys a reputation as the
nation's toughest sheriff for his tent jails and chain gangs.

COURTS Pilot's stepmom sues

The stepmother of child pilot Jessica Dubroff is fighting the girl's mother in
court to gain $ 1.5 million from her husband's life insurance policies. Jessica;
her father, Lloyd Dubroff; and flight instructor Joe Reid died April 11 when
their plane crashed outside Cheyenne, Wyo., on the second day of the
7-year-old's bid to become the youngest person to fly across the United States.
So far, only Jessica's mother, Lisa Hathaway, has received proceeds from three $
750,000 life insurance policies taken out by Lloyd Dubroff. Dubroff's wife,
Melinda Dubroff, said she and her 4-year-old daughter with Dubroff, Kendall,
have received nothing. In court papers filed in Redwood, Calif., Tuesday, she
asked for all $ 750,000 of her husband's first policy, half of his second policy
and half of his third.

Grim reunion

An 11-year-old Arizona boy who played dead as his four sisters bled to death
nearby broke into tears Wednesday after testifying against his father, who shot
them repeatedly with a rifle. The courtroom meeting in Prescott was the first
time Rhyan Yazzie had seen his father since the Sept. 1 slayings. Norman Yazzie
is charged with killing his four daughters, ages 5 to 15, and trying to kill his
son in the family trailer in Dinnehoto, a small community on the Navajo
reservation just south of the Utah border. Investigators have said Norman Yazzie
tried to set the trailer on fire after dousing it with gasoline. Defense
attorneys contend Yazzie is innocent by reason of insanity and was upset about
his wife's infidelity and their impending separation.

SAFETY Residents return

The 700 residents of Mona, Utah, returned home a day after a cloud of burning
chemicals from an overturned truck forced them to evacuate. Mona was emptied
Tuesday when a cloud of burning sodium azide wafted toward the town 65 miles
south of Salt Lake City. About 90 barrels of the chemical - used to inflate car
bags - spilled and ruptured on Interstate 15, igniting into a flaming metallic
soup that smoldered through the night. The fire was put out Wednesday morning.
State crews were still working to clean up a second wreck that occurred
Wednesday near Santaquin, 10 miles to the north, on a road that was being used
as a detour around the first crash site.

Leak plugged

A Lancaster, Pa., man made like the Little Dutch Boy and stopped a gas leak with
his finger. Douglas Maciaes and a friend were moving a gas stove to clean behind
it Tuesday when the pipe broke. There was no shut- off valve in the third-floor
apartment, so he stuck his finger in the pipe while his friend called 911.
Firefighters put a wooden plug in the pipe and shut off the gas.

BUSINESS Disney changes?

Onetime top Hollywood talent broker Michael Ovitz is considering leaving his
position as president of The Walt Disney Co., according to published reports
today. Ovitz, once considered Hollywood's biggest power broker before he joined
Disney, has had talks with Sony Corp., the Japanese electronics and
entertainment company, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and the New
York Post reported. But the Times quoted a Sony spokesman, Peter Wilkes, as
saying: "There are no plans to hire Mr. Ovitz for a position at Sony." The
Journal said it is unclear whether Ovitz will indeed jump from Disney, where he
has clashed with Chairman Michael Eisner, or if the discussion of his job plans
is a negotiating ploy to get more clearcut responsibility at Disney.

The scourge of Atlanta

SECTION: EDITORIAL OLYMPICS; Pg. 20A

LENGTH: 518 words


Long after the Centennial Olympic Games are gone, Atlanta can cling to the
legacy of having been host. But a less glamorous legacy threatens to undermine
all the greatness that this city has achieved in the 20th century: Once again,
Atlanta has earned the dubious distinction of crime capital of the country.

This is not the first time that our city has had the highest crime rate. Nor
will it be the last a unless state and city leaders dispense with rhetoric and
begin to address the problem of crime at its roots.

The solution to crime is not just building more prisons. If it were, this state
would be nearly crime-free. For years, Georgia has locked up more of its
residents than all but a handful of states. Currently, Georgia has the sixth
highest incarceration rate in the country.

And that trend will only grow. Georgia's new "two strikes and you're out" law
may be the toughest in the nation. Under the law, violent criminals will remain
in prison for life, with no chance of parole, upon a second conviction for any
of seven crimes.

But prison is merely the response to crime after it occurs. It has little to do
with reducing the crime rate or protecting the public from the coming onslaught
of violent juvenile crime predicted by experts. If Atlanta hopes to shed the
violent image that threatens its future, our leaders must work now to make
structural changes. They include:

The dispersal of public housing. Atlanta's high crime rate is driven by one of
the highest concentrations of public housing in the country. Projects are
breeding grounds for drugs, gangs and crime.

An aggressive campaign to eliminate teen pregnancy. Teen pregnancy is the
harbinger of poverty and despair, and Georgia has the highest rate in the
nation. Programs with a record of success in reducing teenage pregnancy ought to
be part of every Georgia school's curriculum.

Support for families. Home is where the seeds of crime are planted. Programs
that teach at-risk parents how to care for their children, discipline them
without violence and raise them to be accountable for their actions deserve
government support.

Welfare reform. Real reform will not punish women and their children but will
reward work and draw fathers back into the upbringing of their children.

A metro-wide youth curfew. Police departments throughout the metropolitan area
ought to sign a well-publicized agreement that sets a curfew for young people.
In New Orleans, such a curfew led to a 27 percent drop in juvenile crime the
first year.

Atlanta has suffered a blow with its reinstatement as the nation's most violent
city. It is a public-relations nightmare for those who wish to quell security
concerns for Olympic visitors. But the Olympics, in fact, will bring more than
25,000 law enforcement and military officers to the area. During the Games, this
city should be one of the safest places in the world.

But long after the party's over, crime will remain the scourge of Atlanta. And
it will take the wisdom, foresight and commitment of leaders to restore the
gleaming image that captured the Olympics.

You hear the fearful whispers all the time - stay out of Philadelphia, the
streets are deadly.

Turns out, it's not that bad.

You're more likely to become a homicide statistic in the bustling metropolis of
Winston-Salem, N.C. Or in Dayton, Ohio; Inglewood, Calif.; Bridgeport, Conn.;
Macon, Ga.; Flint, Mich.; or Little Rock, Ark.

And definitely be wary of New Orleans. FBI statistics show that the Big Easy had
the nation's highest murder rate last year, with more than 86 killings per
100,000 population - 60 bodies more per 100,000 than in Philadelphia.

Philadelphia's murder rate placed it 33d among cities, down from 30th the year
before. Its homicide rate fell from 28.1 to 25.9 per 100,000, a decrease of 8
percent, according to FBI statistics released yesterday.

"That's a significant drop, almost 10 percent," said Inspector Jerrold Kane of
the police Homicide Division. "The trend for murder in Philadelphia is down, not
only in numbers but in the rate."

The city's ranking "indicates that we are relatively safe compared to other
cities. But it does not mean that we are safe," said Mayor Rendell.

The FBI statistics, furnished by local police departments under the Uniform
Crime Reporting Program, are preliminary, with final figures and crime rates to
be published later. Totals for some crimes were not available for each city.

Based on the FBI numbers, The Inquirer computed crime rates per 100,000
residents for the cities. The newspaper relied on the U.S. Census Bureau's
estimated 1993 populations, because 1994 estimates have not been released.

Population changes between 1993 and 1994 could cause the rates to vary somewhat.

Nationwide, violent and nonviolent crime reported to police dipped in 1994 for
the third consecutive year, according to the FBI. But experts said the figures
conceal trouble ahead as teenage boys commit murder at alarming rates.

Police reports of seven major crimes dropped 3 percent from 1993. That included
a 4 percent decline in violent crimes and a 3 percent reduction in the far more
numerous property crimes, the bureau said. Increases were shown, however, in
crimes committed by teenage boys.

In suburbs, overall crime showed no change. It increased 1 percent in rural
areas.

Philadelphia reported 404 homicides to the FBI last year, down from 439 the year
before. While Philadelphia "consistently ranks as the safest of the 10 largest
cities in the country," Rendell said, "we believe we will do better."

He said help is on the way: 753 new police officers are to be added over the
next three years, thanks to the most recent federal crime bill and city treasury
savings. That will represent a 14 percent increase in the overall force, and an
18 percent increase in officers on patrol, he said.

The 404 killings in Philadelphia placed it sixth in homicides last year, behind
New York (1,561), Chicago (928), Los Angeles (846), Detroit (541) and New
Orleans (425).

Following Philadelphia were Washington (399 homicides), Houston (375) and
Baltimore (321). Ranked 10th was Dallas, with 296 killings.

Philadelphia police officials pointed out that the statistics reflect reported
crime - which can be below the number of actual crimes. People may decide not to
report a crime because it's inconvenient, they're embarrassed or they don't
think anything will be done about it.

Rendell, a former city district attorney, noted that murder is one crime that
rarely goes unreported.

The murder rate in New Jersey's four largest cities, Elizabeth, Newark, Jersey
City and Paterson, rose 2 percent in 1994, and the arson rate climbed 38
percent, according to the FBI. Serious crime dropped about 3 percent in
Elizabeth, Newark and Jersey City, and almost 12 percent in Paterson.

In other serious-crime categories for urban New Jersey, reported rapes fell 22
percent; robbery fell 4 percent; and aggravated assault was unchanged, according
to the FBI.

One of the most interesting changes in the murder statistics occurred in New
York City, where the homicide rate dropped 20 percent. The rate in the city of
7.3 million people fell from 26.5 percent to 21.25 per 100,000 people. The
number of murders decreased from 1,946 to 1,561.

That lowered New York's murder rate to 48th in the nation, down from 35th a year
earlier, and made the city just the slightest bit deadlier than Beaumont, Texas,
and Rockford, Ill.

"New York did a hell of a job last year," said Kane, the Philadelphia homicide
inspector. "A 20 percent decrease - that's amazing."

Other cities with big drops in their murder rates included Gary, Ind., the
previous national leader. In 1994, Gary ranked fourth, its homicide rating
having fallen from 89.1 to 67.9 per 100,000 people - a 24 percent decline. The
number of killings went from 105 to 80.

The homicide rate was down 12 percent in Washington last year, 9 percent in
Baltimore and 6 percent in Atlanta, although all three cities remained in the
nation's murder-rate top 10.

Murder rates spiked up in Hartford, Conn., (up 83 percent); Macon, Ga., (60
percent); and Phoenix (47 percent).

Macon recorded 32 murders last year, and Hartford, 55. Phoenix reported 233
killings, up from 158 the year before.

Philadelphia also appears to be a safer place to park your car than is often
thought. The city ranked 34th in the nation in the rate of auto thefts, with
1,621 thefts per 100,000 population. That's up from the previous year, when the
city ranked 41st, with 1,525 per 100,000 people.

Cars were flying out of Tampa, Fla., which led the nation in the rate of auto
thefts - 3,812 per 100,000. Tampa was followed by Fresno, Cal.; Newark, N.J.;
Detroit; Miami; and Jackson, Miss.

Although declines occurred in every region of the country and in cities of
almost every size, experts said the heartening statistics mask an explosion of
gun murders by teenage boys.

"The overall crime rate hides the grim truth because it mixes together two crime
trends going in opposite directions," said James Alan Fox, dean of the
College of Criminal Justice at Northeastern University in Boston.

"The rate (at which) adults commit crime is dropping fast. The 76 million baby
boomers, who dominate the numbers, are getting into middle age and are not so
violent as when they were younger," Fox said. "But the rate at which boys are
committing crimes, particularly homicide, is skyrocketing."

The report has no data on the age of offenders. But Fox said final FBI data
from 1985-93 show that the number of adults 25 or older committing murder
decreased 20 percent. In the same period, homicides committed by 18- to 24-
year-old males increased 65 percent and by 14- to 17-year-old males, 165
percent.

Rate of violent crime in U.S. has dropped in '80s, report says

SECTION: NATIONAL; National Digest; Pg. 4A

LENGTH: 729 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON; DUNKIRK, N.Y.; SAN JOSE, Calif.; SAN ANTONIO, Texas; OAK
RIDGE, Tenn.



WASHINGTON - The nationwide rate of violent crime - including rape,    robbery
and assault - substantially declined in the 1980s following a    moderate rise
in violent crime during the 1970s, the Justice Department    said Sunday. The
National Crime Survey also said violent crime across    the United States had
not increased in severity. The bureau, in its    nationwide study of violent
crime trends, estimated there were 32    victims per 1,000 people age 12 or
older during 1985, compared with 36    per 1,000 during 1973, the year the
bureau began its National Crime    Survey. The rate at which people were
victimized by strangers declined    during the 13-year period, and the rate of
violent crimes committed by    acquaintances was about the same. The rate for
violent crimes by    relatives, however, increased from 6 percent of all violent
offenses in    1973 to 9 percent in 1985.



 Car-train crash kills 6 teens

 DUNKIRK, N.Y. - A freight train slammed into a car apparently trying    to beat
the locomotive past a crossing early Sunday, killing six high    school seniors
returning from a Halloween party, authorities said.

 Officer David Ortolano said the car either drove under the gate just    before
it dropped or went around it. The driver, Randy Haase, and    Robert Radloff,
Melissa Ziegler, Jody Wdowiasz, Paula Kushel and    Jennifer Styborski died at
the scene.



 Pilot crashes, walks for help

 SAN JOSE, Calif. - The pilot of a single-engine airplane lost his way    in
canyons near rugged Mount Hamilton and crashed on Halloween, then    walked
three miles with a broken leg to summon help for his injured



 passenger, officials said. David Riffle, 37, of Campbell, was over    Joseph D.
Grant County Park on Saturday when his right wing clipped a    tree. The plane
crashed about two miles east of Mount Hamilton, 10    miles east of downtown San
Jose. On Sunday, Riffle and his passenger,    Cliff Cordy, 49, of San Jose, were
in stable condition at Santa Clara    Valley Medical Center. Cordy suffered cuts
and bruises.



 Report links firm, jet parts

 SAN ANTONIO, Texas - A Norwegian company suspected by the U.S.    government of
selling equipment that helped the Soviet Union make its    submarines more
difficult to detect has been providing parts to    American jet fighters in a $
13.2-million contract, the San Antonio    Light reported Sunday. The contracts
were awarded in 1981 by Kelly Air    Force Base to Norsk Jet Air Motors, a
division of Kongsberg    Vapenfabrikk, for the production of turbine parts for
the engines of    F-15 and F-16 jet fighters. Kongsberg was accused of a gross
security    breach after it was disclosed last summer that it and Toshiba, a
Japanese firm, shipped $ 17-million worth of computer-controlled milling
equipment to a Soviet military shipyard. A Kelly spokeswoman said Norsk    was
sold by the parent company in September.



 Bomb-grade uranium reported

 OAK RIDGE, Tenn. - Production of the first bomb-grade uranium in the    United
States since 1964 has begun, and the nuclear weapons plant here    will be the
final processing site, a newspaper reported Sunday. Since    1964, all
bomb-grade uranium needs have been met by drawing from    existing stockpiles at
Oak Ridge and by recycling material in weapons    retired from the U.S. nuclear
arsenal. Federal officials confirmed the    United States recently shipped raw
uranium to England, where it will be    enriched as the first step in the
production, the Knoxville    News-Sentinel said. The material then will be
returned to the    Department of Energy's (DOE) gaseous diffusion plant in
Piketon, Ohio,    where it will be transformed into nearly pure U-235, a highly
    fissionable isotope of uranium, the newspaper said. The U-235 will then
be sent to the Y-12 nuclear weapons plant in Oak Ridge, where it will    be
converted into a weapons-usable form. The final product will be    shipped under
tight security from Oak Ridge to England for what DOE    officials described as
a "variety of purposes."

Crime risk high near airports;
For travelers, study is 'wake-up call'

BYLINE: Gary Stoller, USA TODAY

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 1A

LENGTH: 480 words


The risk of becoming a crime victim is four times greater than the national
average in areas outside most of the nation's big-city airports, a new study by
a crime-forecasting company reveals.

The exclusive study, done for USA TODAY by CAP Index, of Exton, Pa., shows that
the likelihood of a crime exceeds the national average outside 28 of 29 airports
in the most-populous metropolitan regions of the country and all 26 central
train stations studied.

"I travel all the time, and it's a wake-up call," says Jon Groussman, president
and COO of CAP Index.

Thefts, assaults and robberies are the most common crimes in neighborhoods
outside airports and central train stations, criminologist Rosemary Erickson
says.

Airports and train stations may feel safe to travelers because of a greater
presence of police and security people. However, travelers should be careful not
to carry a false sense of security outside with them, criminologists warn.

"(Travelers) are relatively secure inside the airport boundaries," Groussman
says. "But the immediate areas they're located in often have neighborhood
characteristics that strongly correlate with increased crime potential."

Those areas are often poor neighborhoods, which have a higher likelihood of
crime, says Lewis Yablonsky, emeritus professor of criminology at California
State University-Northridge.

The area outside Philadelphia International Airport has the greatest crime risk
of any area outside an airport in the 25 most-populous metropolitan regions, the
CAP Index study finds.

The lowest risk is outside Pittsburgh International, where the likelihood of
crime is nearly half the national average.

In Houston, the risk is high outside George Bush Intercontinental Airport and
the city's Amtrak station. The area outside the station on Washington Avenue has
a higher crime risk than any other area near a big central train station,
according to the CAP Index study.

Other train station neighborhoods with a very high crime risk: those outside
Union Station in Los Angeles and Chicago, and Philadelphia's 30th Street
Station. The area outside the central rail station on Vine Avenue in Riverside,
Calif., has the lowest likelihood of crime of the big cities studied, but it's
still more than double the national average.

Areas around airports and train stations aren't necessarily the most dangerous
areas of a city. Nor does a high risk of crime around transportation terminals
mean a city has that same risk or that it's more dangerous than another city.

regions of the country.

Chambersburg ranks No. 8 least-violent metro in NE

CHAMBERSBURG &GT;&GT; The Chambersburg-Waynesboro metropolitan area ranks among
the 10 safest metro areas in the Northeast, according to an analysis of national
crime reports.

Law Street Media recently reported the most dangerous and the safest metro areas
in four regions of the U.S. based on violent crime rates .

Three of the Northeast's safest metro areas are in central Pennsylvania   No. 8
Chambersburg (Franklin County), No. 4 Gettysburg (Adams County), and No. 2 State
College (Centre County).

Bangor, Maine, was the safest, according to the report.

Violent crimes are crimes against a person. They include murder, rape, robbery
and aggravated assault.

The rankings were based on the number of violent crimes per 100,000 people in
2013, the most recent year for which complete data is available. Police annually
report crimes in their jurisdiction to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Franklin County, including the Borough of Shippensburg, had 230 violent crimes
in 2013, or 152 per 100,000 people. The local violent crime rate was nearly
twice that in Bangor and less than a third of the Northeast's "most dangerous"
Vineland-Bridgeton, New Jersey. The New Jersey metro area also ranked the 48th
most dangerous metro nationwide.

Of other communities nearby on the Interstate 81 corridor   Winchester,
Virginia, ranked ninth safest metro in the South with 186 violent crimes per
100,000. Hagerstown, Maryland, with 233 violent crimes per 100,000 did not make
either list.

The rankings do not consider violent crimes separately:

The murder rate was the same in Vineland-Bridgeton as in Bangor (4 per 100,000).
Franklin County had three murders per 100,000.

Franklin County had the highest robbery rate among the 10 safest metros in the
Northeast.

The Chambersburg-Waynesboro Metro Area was defined in 2012 after the Census
Bureau determined that the greater Chambersburg area qualified as an urban core
with more than 50,000 people.

The statistical area has the county boundaries.

Memphis was the nation's most dangerous metro area. Philadelphia was the most
dangerous in Pennsylvania and No. 3 in the Northeast.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation compiles crime reports from law enforcement
agencies across the nation. Law Street crunched the numbers into rankings.

Public Opinion found that Law Street's data was comprehensive. It included
Franklin County crimes reported by Pennsylvania State Police as well as
municipal police and other state agencies.

El Paso ranked safest large city in U.S. for 3rd straight year

   PDF: CQ Press safest cities ranking by population categories

El Paso has been named the "safest large city" in the nation for the third time,
according to rankings by a research publishing firm.

Officials credited law enforcement and residents working together in making El
Paso the city with the "lowest crime rate ranking" of cities more than 500,000
population in the annual City Crime Rankings by CQ Press.

Mayor John Cook said there are a couple of reasons that El Paso is "the number
one safest large city in the United States."

"The first is a great Police Department," Cook said. The second reason is "we
have a focus on community policing in that we get everybody involved (in
fighting crime). The things we are doing are working."

El Paso has been in the top three large cities with the lowest crime rates since
1997.

The rankings used to be named the "safest" and "dangerous" rankings and are
still commonly known by those names, but CQ Press changed the official name to
the "City Crime Rankings" a few years ago.

The rankings are based on yearly data from the FBI's Uniform Crime Report for
the crimes of murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary,
larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft and arson.

There were 33 cities in the rankings with a more than a half-million people.

"All El Pasoans should be proud of this recognition as it is truly a reflection
of the El Paso community," Police Chief Greg Allen said in a news release.

Crime rate dives in US

SECTION: WORLD; Pg. 8

LENGTH: 191 words


LOS ANGELES: Last year's crime rate in Los Angeles was the lowest in 50 years,
with drops reported in everything from homicides to car thefts.

Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa said 314 homicides had been reported, the fewest
since 1967.

And the crime drops are being mirrored elsewhere in the nation: Washington
finished the year with its lowest murder tally since 1966; San Francisco
reported its lowest number of homicides in 48 years; and New York, Chicago,
Boston and Dallas reported a dramatic year-on-year decline.

Experts believe the fall in violent crime is tied to the ageing population.

``The greying of America is a significant factor,'' James Alan Fox, professor of
criminal justice at Northeastern University in Boston, said.

``The largest and fastest-growing segment of the population is people over 50.
People over 50 also happen to be the age group that is the least likely to
commit crimes. As the group grows, crime rates do decline.''

Professor Fox said a common assumption that crime increases during a recession
was wrong, historic data showing there was little connection between economic
conditions and crime, particularly violent crime.

U.S. violent crimes escalate for second straight year

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON


WASHINGTON - More murders and robberies in 2006 sent U.S. violent crimes higher
for the second straight year, the Federal Bureau of Investigation said
yesterday, with the increase blamed on gangs, youth violence, gun crimes and
fewer police on beats. The agency reported the number of violent crimes
nationwide went up by 1.3% last year, after a 2.3% increase in 2005. That had
been the first rise in four years and the biggest percentage gain in 15 years.
The report showed that murders in big cities jumped last year by 6.7%, while
robberies, an important indicator of crime trends, increased 6% nationwide.
Cities with big increases in the number of murders included Orlando and Miami,
Fla.; Oakland and San Diego, Calif.; Phoenix, Ariz.; Corpus Christi, Tex.; Grand
Rapids, Mich.; Reno, Nev.; and Little Rock, Ark. Even though the higher violent
crime numbers had been expected, they still represented bad news for Alberto
Gonzales, the U.S. Attorney General, who has made violent crime a top priority.

ST. LOUIS ISN'T THE CRIME CAPITAL

SECTION: EDITORIAL, Pg. B6

LENGTH: 306 words



CRIME

IT is a dubious distinction that any city would want to avoid: Crime Capital of
America. Unfortunately, and unfairly, St. Louis got tagged with that moniker
last week. In a Post-Dispatch analysis of the FBI's 1998 crime statistics, St.
Louis was at the top of the list of the nation's cities in crimes per 100,000
population. Following close behind were Atlanta, the middle-class mecca of the
South, and Orlando, Fla., the nation's vacation capital.

Not only was the characterization unfair, it was inaccurate, experts say. Even
the FBI warned against using its statistics to make direct comparisons among
cities, because there are so many variables that affect the reporting, type and
amount of crime.

For example, each city in the study was supposed to report crimes in eight
categories, but some cities didn't. Other cities, like Philadelphia, weren't
ranked at all because their crime statistics were unreliable or because they
didn't report them. Finally, the FBI says, it is impossible to compare
accurately cities with vastly different demographics and populations. How can
one compare New York City to Jackson, Tenn.?

If anything, the statistics suggest that crime in St. Louis is decreasing. The
number of murders committed in 1998 was the lowest since 1964, and down 26
percent from 1997. Forcible rape, aggravated assault, burglary, motor vehicle
theft and arson were also down. The only crime that increased was larceny, which
included everything from the theft of a concrete birdbath to the embezzlement of
$ 100,000 from Mercantile Bank.

So, no, St. Louis isn't really the crime capital of the nation. The city has its
share of serious problems - like lead poisoning of children - in which it does
rank first (worst). But St. Louis should not be unfairly burdened with labels it
doesn't deserve.

Border city crime down: Crime statistics show decline in 2008-2009

BYLINE: By Diana Washington Valdez \ El Paso Times

LENGTH: 882 words


EL PASO -- El Paso and five other large cities on or near the border reported
decreases in crime from 2008 to 2009 -- the peak years of Mexico's drug cartel
wars -- according to FBI statistics.

The numbers support President Barack Obama's contention that border crime has
decreased.

"Contrary to some of the reports that you see, crime along the border is down,"
Obama said Thursday during his speech on immigration reform.

Chula Vista, Calif., Tucson and the Texas cities of El Paso, Laredo, McAllen and
Browns ville reported declines or held steady for most of the 10 crimes the FBI
tracks each year for cities with populations of 100,000 or more.

The FBI's Uniform Crime Reports include statistics for violent crime, murder,
rape, robbery, aggravated assault, property crime, burglary, larceny, auto theft
and arson.

Obama also said, "We have more boots on the ground near the Southwest border
than at any time in our history," including doubling the numbers of people
assigned to Border Enforcement Security Task Forces as border intelligence
analysts.

The president sought to counter claims by politicians such as U.S. Sen. Jon Kyl,
R-Ariz., who alleged that Obama wants to pursue immigration reform without first
committing adequate resources to secure the border.

Kyl told his Arizona supporters that Obama was holding border security hostage
in exchange for congressional approval of comprehensive immigration reform.

White House officials denied the allegations.

Earlier this year, Kyl said Mexico's crackdown on the drug cartels that began in
December 2006 led to a rise in violence at the border. "The cartels are fighting
back, leading to a dangerous uptick in violence on both sides of the border,"
Kyl said.

Although the Mexican side of the border has reported dramatic increases in
violence, particularly in Ju?rez, the same trend has not been seen at U.S.
border urban centers.

Kyl, the Senate minority whip, also alleged that Obama wants to cut the budgets
for border security agencies, including the Border Patrol.

"For example, the budget President Obama proposed for fiscal year 2011 would
actually reduce both the number of Border Patrol agents available to secure the
border and the number of detention spaces available to hold illegal immigrants,"
Kyl said.

However, the federal budget is not final yet and is subject each year to
negotiations among politicians of both major parties.

Matt Chandler, spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, said Obama's
supplemental request to Congress would provide $399 million for the Department
of Homeland Security.

"The request includes $297 million to hire 1,000 new Border Patrol agents,
including 500 for Arizona, $37 million for two new unmanned aerial detection
systems, $52.5 million for 160 new ICE agents, including 50 for Arizona, $6.5
million for 30 new Customs and Border Protection officers, and $6 million for 20
new CBP canine teams," Chandler said.

He said CBP and ICE officials also said that during the past year officers:

     ·    Seized $85 million in illicit cash along the Southwest border -- a 22
          percent increase over the same period during the previous year. Seized
          1,404 firearms and 1.62 million kilograms of drugs along the Southwest
          border -- increases of, respectively, 22 and 14 percent from the same
          period during the previous year. Seized $29.5 million in illicit
          southbound cash along the Southwest border -- a 39 percent increase
          over the same period during the previous year.


The U.S. Border Patrol-El Paso Sector, which includes Southern New Mexico and
West Texas, now has about 1,000 agents, compared with 975 in 2006, officials
said.

Nationally, the Border Patrol went from a force of 12,349 in fiscal year 2006 to
about 20,000 in fiscal year 2009. The fiscal year runs from Oct. 1 to Sept. 30.

In fiscal year 2007, CBP hired 2,156 new officers, an increase of 648. According
to The Associated Press, the combined budgets of CBP and ICE totaled $1 billion
in the 2000 fiscal year, and may reach $3.5 billion in fiscal year 2011.

Obama said agents are seizing more illegal guns, cash and drugs than in the
past, in part because of the new initiative that calls for screening all
southbound rail shipments.

He also said CBP reported a significant reduction in the number of people trying
to cross the border illegally.

In the El Paso sector alone in 2009, the Border Patrol apprehended 14,999 people
who tried to enter the United States illegally, compared with 30,312 in fiscal
year 2008 and 75,000 in fiscal year 2007.

El Paso's Border Patrol spokesman Doug Mosier said the Border Patrol is now in a
good position with staffing and equipment.

"We are challenged sometimes in some places, such as New Mexico's Bootheel area,
and at times in areas like Fabens in West Texas," Mosier said.

Border security "does nothing to stop the jobs magnet or bring the 11 million
unauthorized immigrants into the system legally," said Ali Noorani, executive
director of the National Immigration Forum in Washington, D.C. "And it does
nothing to reform our legal immigration system so that it can respond flexibly
to future labor market needs. Congress must act immediately in a bipartisan way
to solve this problem for the American people once and for all." ?

CRIME BILL FAILS ON A HOUSE VOTE, STUNNING CLINTON

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE,   Special to The New York Times

SECTION: Section A;  Page 1;  Column 5;  National Desk

LENGTH: 1162 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 11


In a startling defeat for the House Democratic leadership and an embarrassment
for President Clinton, the House shelved the Administration's anti-crime bill on
a procedural vote today. It was the third time in four years that a major crime
bill was stifled or scaled back at the last minute.

A move to bring the bill to the floor was defeated 225 to 210, with 58 Democrats
going against their party and their President to derail the $30 billion package
that contained a ban on the sale of 19 assault weapons. The assault-weapon ban
was strenuously opposed by gun proponents, while death penalty provisions were
opposed by liberals and blacks.

The defeat, which an angered President Clinton called "a procedural trick
orchestrated by the National Rifle Association, then heavily pushed by the
Republican leadership," left both the White House and Congress stunned. And it
dimmed the chances that a comprehensive crime measure would be resurrected
during this session of Congress.

"Anyone who thinks we can produce a new crime bill in the month remaining is
smoking something," said a disappointed Representative Charles E. Schumer, the
Brooklyn Democrat who had steered much of the legislation through the House.

President Clinton, while clearly upset over the loss, nonetheless exhorted the
leadership to revisit the matter and continue try to produce a crime bill. "We
can do better than this," he said in an appearance at the White House after the
vote, "and I want the Congress and the House to go back to work tomorrow and
figure out how to save the elements of this bill." [Excerpts, A16.]

In a signal that Mr. Clinton was determined to fight back, the White House
announced abruptly tonight that he would go to Minneapolis on Friday to address
the National Association of Police Officers.

"These are the people who are on the front lines of crime, and we're not giving
up," said Dee Dee Myers, the White House spokeswoman.

With many Americans ranking crime as their top concern and with the entire House
up for election in November, failure on the bill could prod voters to sweep out
the incumbents, most of whom are Democrats.

Moreover, the loss of the crime bill deprives the House leadership of
much-needed momentum for its floundering health care legislation. Representative
Newt Gingrich, the Republican whip, warned after the vote that if the Democrats
continued on what he described as a narrow partisan road, "they will frankly
lose the health bill in the same manner they lost this."

Democrats were so stunned at their loss that they could hardly explain their
gross miscalculation. They were foiled by a bizarre if unintended alliance among
liberal blacks, conservative gun proponents and Republicans, and an opposition
strategy intended to undermine the legislation by focusing on the decision
whether to bring it to the floor for a vote, allowing members to avoid a
potentially harder vote on the bill itself.

In the last two weeks the Democrats repeatedly postponed the vote because they
knew they did not have the support to pass the procedural measure. Asked why the
measure was brought up this afternoon, after two earlier postponements today,
without having the votes in hand, Mr. Schumer said, "We thought we did."

Other Democrats blamed the Republicans. But this ignored the long-apparent fact
that so many Democrats were prepared to desert their party over the ban on
assault weapons and the death penalty.

"What you could see is people getting nervous and feeling the pressure, and
that's what happened with the N.R.A. and the Republican leadership," a senior
White House official said tonight. "That counted for a couple of votes, and then
we had the black caucus, which cared deeply about the death penalty and racial
justice. And then we had some people who, frankly, just misled us."

Asked whether those who prevaricated were Republicans or Democrats, the official
replied, "Both."

Predicting that the White House's fight for a bill was not over by any means,
the official also said: "We will get a crime bill. We just have to figure out
what it looks like."

Eleven of the 38 members of the Black Congressional Caucus voted against the
measure. Some opposed the expansion of the death penalty to apply to more than
50 circumstances. Others opposed the omission of a provision that they said
would have protected death-row inmates from racial discrimination in sentencing.

But the bulk of Democratic opposition came from those who opposed the proposed
ban on assault weapons, and today's vote was a comeback for the National Rifle
Association, which narrowly lost the weapons-ban measure earlier this year.

The Democratic sponsors counted on being joined by 15 to 20 moderate
Republicans. They got only 11. Some strategists said the Democrats made a
tactical error and alienated potential Republican supporters by waiting until 7
P.M. on Wednesday before they gave the Republicans a copy of the final bill.

Some members had their own individual problems with the bill. For example,
Representative Susan Molinari, a New York Republican who had previously
supported the ban on assault weapons, had intended to support the measure today
but wound up voting against it. She said she had wanted a provision that would
have allowed prior conviction of sex crimes to be admitted in court in some
circumstances. And she wanted communities to be notified when a sexual predator
was released from prison. Neither provision made the final bill.

Some Blame the Bill

Others chalked the defeat up to what they said was a bad bill, even though
today's vote was on a procedural move and not the substance of the 972-page bill
itself.

"You wrote a crime bill that you can't sell to your members," said Dick Armey,
Republican of Texas.

While President Clinton and the bill's sponsors hailed it as a breakthrough
meaure that advanced both prevention and punishment, its opponents lambasted it
as wasteful spending on social programs that would have little effect on crime.

The bill was much ridiculed for spending money on dance programs, arts and
crafts, midnight basketball leagues and programs to promote self-esteem.

Republicans also pointed out in recent days that the bill contained $10 million
that Representative Jack Brooks, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, had
inserted for his alma mater, Lamar University, to build a criminal justice
center.

It is entirely possible that the leadership could re-emerge with a more
acceptable bill. "The leadership is going to let it sit for a few days," said
one top Democrat.

David Dryer, a California Republican, said the 100,000 new police officers that
the bill promised were a sham. "We'll be lucky to get one-quarter of that," he
said.

The debate closed with the rare act of Speaker Thomas S. Foley climbing down
from the Speaker's chair to address the chamber.

"The society that cannot protect its citizens is a pretty useless society," he
said.

Murder here fell 14 percent Nationally last year, violent crime fell 5.5 pct.
and property crime fell 4.9 pct., FBI says.

Violent crime in St. Louis fell by less than 1 percent last year, according to
statistics released by the FBI on Monday, but the number of murders dropped 14
percent, from 167 to 143, compared with the year before.

St. Louis had small increases in forcible rape, robbery and larceny theft, and
showed a 2.79 percent decrease in overall property crime.

Nationally, violent crime fell 5.5 percent last year, and property crime fell
4.9 percent, the FBI said.

The federal statistics, compiled from 13,237 law enforcement agencies, show that
violent crime fell for a third consecutive year and that property crime was down
for the seventh year.

The federal numbers are considered preliminary and will be updated depending on
reports from local agencies.

Three large Missouri cities bucked the national trend and had increases in
overall violent crime: Columbia, up 27.8 percent ; Springfield, up 12 percent;
and Kansas City, up less than 1 percent.

In Illinois, Chicago had a 10 percent decrease in murders .

In the Midwest, overall violent crime dropped 4.6 percent, the FBI said. The
South had the biggest regional drop, at 6.6 percent, followed by the West with
5.6 percent. Violent crime in the Northeast fell 3.5 percent.

Cities with populations of 500,000 to 999,999 had the largest decrease in
violent crime: 7.5 percent. Nonmetropolitan counties had a 3 percent decrease,
the lowest in the county category.

Murders, the violent crime that generally gets the most attention from the
media, were down 7.2 percent nationally. Murders were up 5.3 percent in cities
with populations of 25,000 to 49,999, the only urban category to record an
increase.

Metro area crime rank improving, study finds

BYLINE: Josh Nelson, Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier, Iowa

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 402 words


Nov. 25--WATERLOO -- The Waterloo-Cedar Falls metro area ranked in the middle of
the pack for the nation's crime ranking for 2009.

An analysis of crime rates in 332 metropolitan areas by CQ Press put the
Waterloo-Cedar Falls area at 193, an improvement of 18 spots from last year.
Pine Bluff, Ark., was No. 1 with the highest crime rate, while State College,
Pa., had the lowest.

Mayor Tim Hurley said the improvement in the area's ranking didn't surprise him.

"We have been making special efforts in law enforcement," Hurley said.

Those efforts included reaching out to the community to get people to report
crimes and talk with police if they witnessed something, he said.

Among Iowa cities, Cedar Rapids was safest at No. 287. The Omaha-Council Bluffs
metro was ranked 119, making it more dangerous than Waterloo-Cedar Falls. The
Des Moines area came in at 200. Ames, Iowa City, Sioux City and Dubuque also
made the list at 206, 232, 250 and 262, respectively.

All of the communities except for the Omaha-Council Bluffs metro had total crime
rates lower than the national average, the report said.

The report looked at the 2008 crime data collected by the Federal Bureau of
Investigation for metropolitan areas with a population over 50,000 people. Some
areas like Chicago, Detroit and the Quad Cities weren't included because FBI
data wasn't available, the report said.

The ranking was compiled by comparing a weighted average of crimes in a year --
including rape, murder, burglary and assault -- against the national average.

The report also ranked cities' crime rates, which only included those with a
population over 75,000 people. Waterloo was not on that list, though Des Moines,
Sioux City, Cedar Rapids and Davenport made it.

CQ Press, based in Washington, D.C., publishes reference literature on public
affairs, government and politics. The company is owned by Sage Publications and
was created in 1945 by Nelson and Henrietta Poynter, founders of Congressional

D.C.'s 78 Percent Police Approval Rating Lowest Among 12 Cities

Edward Walsh, Washington Post Staff Writer

SECTION: A SECTION; Pg. A22

LENGTH: 1206 words


An overwhelming majority of District residents say they are satisfied with the
performance of local police, but their level of support is the lowest among
residents of a dozen cities ranked in a broad national survey released
yesterday.

The report, prepared by the Justice Department and based on interviews with
members of more than 10,000 households, also showed a continuing gap in the
perception of police performance by whites and minorities. While only 10 percent
of whites in the 12 cities expressed dissatisfaction with the local police, 24
percent of blacks and 22 percent of other minorities said they were
dissatisfied.

Overall, 85 percent of respondents said they were satisfied with their local
police, including 18 percent who said they were "very satisfied."

In the District, 78 percent of residents said they were satisfied, the lowest
approval figure for any of the cities.

The responses of D.C. residents also reflected the national disparity in
perceptions of police performance by whites and blacks. While 81 percent of
District whites said they were satisfied with the local police, only 75 percent
of D.C. blacks said they were satisfied.

The white satisfaction level in the District was the lowest in the cities
surveyed. The black satisfaction level here was also near the bottom: Only
blacks in Chicago and Knoxville, Tenn., expressed less satisfaction with local
law enforcement.

D.C. Police Chief Charles H. Ramsey said the District is doing well, with a 78
percent approval rating for police performance, "considering where we are coming
from. . . . I've been here a year, and I'd say we've got a long way to go, but
that 78 percent is nothing to be ashamed of."

"Those other cities didn't have to come back as far as we did," he added.

Ramsey, who noted that the District's violent crime rate is currently 10 percent
below the national average, came to Washington in the midst of an investigation
into corruption in the D.C. police department and alleged wrongdoing by the
previous chief. Since becoming chief, he has asked the Justice Department to
investigate the use of force by D.C. police officers in response to a Washington
Post series that showed that District police had the highest rate of excessive
use of force of any department in the country.

The Justice Department report comes at a time when police performance and
relations with the local community are topics of growing interest around the
country. Next week, Attorney General Janet Reno will play host to a conference
on the subject. Justice Department officials said police executives are eager to
have information such as that contained in the report to help guide their
decision-making.

The survey by the Bureau of Justice Statistics and the Office of Community
Oriented Policing Services included the nation's two largest cities -- New York
and Los Angeles -- as well as Kansas City, Mo., Madison, Wis., San Diego,
Savannah, Ga., Spokane, Wash., Springfield, Mass., and Tucson.

The Justice Department conducts a national survey on crime victimization
annually, but this was the first time in 20 years that the department conducted
in-depth interviews in selected communities to learn more about public attitudes
toward the police and crime.

Compared with the other cities, Washington ranked at or near the bottom in
several categories:

District residents were the least satisfied with the quality of life in their
neighborhoods. In some cities, including Kansas City, Knoxville, Madison and San
Diego, more than 90 percent of residents said they were satisfied with their
neighborhood's quality of life. In D.C., 79 percent expressed satisfaction,
slightly below the satisfaction levels in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago,
which were around 81 percent.

District residents and their counterparts in Chicago were the most fearful of
neighborhood crime. Almost half of those interviewed in the two cities said they
feared neighborhood crime. Fear of neighborhood crime in the other cities ranged
from 20 percent in Madison, a state capital and the location of the University
of Wisconsin, to 45 percent in Springfield, an aging industrial city in western
Massachusetts. However, less than 10 percent of those surveyed in any of the
cities said they were "very fearful" of neighborhood crime. In the District, 7
percent described themselves as "very fearful."

More District residents reported knowing of serious crimes in their
neighborhoods during the previous year than residents in any of the other cities
surveyed. Half of D.C. residents said they knew of such crimes. In the other
cities, knowledge of neighborhood crimes ranged from 28 percent in Knoxville to
43 percent in New York and Chicago.

D.C. and Savannah had the highest property crime rates among the cities, with
445 crimes per 1,000 households. White District residents had the highest
property crime victimization rate of any group in the survey -- 513 per 1,000
households. D.C. and Knoxville were the only two cities where whites were more
frequently the victims of property crimes than blacks.

On the other hand, based on the survey, the District had the lowest violent
crime rate of any of the cities -- 60 crimes per 1,000 people -- and District
whites were the least likely to have been victims of violent crimes of any group
in the survey. The violent crime rate against D.C. whites was 52 per 1,000
people; against blacks, the rate was 67 per 1,000 people.

Violent crimes covered by the survey included rape, sexual assault, robbery and
assault. They did not include murder because murder victims could not be
interviewed.

During the 1990s, the murder rate declined in all of the cities surveyed except
Spokane and Tucson, including an almost 27 percent drop in the District. But
according to FBI data, in 1997 the District's murder rate of almost 57 murders
per 100,000 people was more than double the murder rate in any of the other 11
cities.

Satisfaction With Police

In a survey of residents of 12 cities, whites were consistently more satisfied
with police than blacks. In D.C., whites were less satisfied with police than
whites in other cities.

Crime rate recedes, but wariness remains

BYLINE: Patrick O'Driscoll

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 11A

LENGTH: 3391 words


The statistics are stunning: For six years in a row, serious crime
in America has steadily declined.

Since 1991, murder has fallen almost 28%. Rape is down 13%. Robbery
has plunged 29%. In almost every big city from New York and Boston
to Los Angeles and San Francisco, the number of assaults, burglaries
and car thefts has plummeted.

In 1996, the number of crime victims was the lowest since the
federal government began keeping track 25 years ago. Still, the
impression lingers among many that the United States is in the
clutches of more lawlessness, despite numerical proof of less.


But dozens of personal interviews and a new USA TODAY/CNN/Gallup
Poll suggest the drop in crime may be sinking in. Across the country,
there are flickers of recognition that serious offenses are receding
across the board. In Boston, Los Angeles and other cities, some
colleges and universities attribute increased enrollment in part
to parents who are no longer afraid to send their children to
inner-city campuses. In New York, Baltimore and elsewhere, real
estate prices are climbing in neighborhoods once abandoned or
shunned out of fear.

Even mundane acts like getting home-delivery pizza or strolling
through a local park are possible again in formerly tough neighborhoods
from Columbia, S.C., to Union City, Calif.

In the new poll, five in 10 of the 1,013 adults questioned think
there's more crime in the country now than a year ago. But in
an identical poll in 1993, nearly nine out of 10 felt that way.

Compared with a similar poll question five years ago, fewer people
say they worry very much now about being murdered, mugged, raped,
burglarized or attacked in their cars.

Not that they've lost their wariness. However long the decline
continues, the crime wave that preceded it conditioned American
society to keep its guard up, perhaps permanently.

Levels of caution thought unnecessary in the 1950s are common
behavior today. Nearly 8 million people now live in gated communities
in the suburbs, with their implied promise of walling out strangers
and criminals. Millions more are installing home and car security
systems. In 42 states, growing numbers are carrying concealed
handguns for self-protection.

Sunday, the FBI will publish final crime reports for 1997, chronicling
a sixth straight year of fewer violent and serious offenses. From
cities to suburbs to rural towns, there is less murder, rape,
robbery and aggravated assault. Also down are the major property
crimes of burglary, larceny, car theft and arson.

"There was a time when I couldn't jog in my own neighborhood.
Now I can walk it at night," says Maria Viramontes, 47, of Richmond,
Calif., who heads an anti-crime coalition of 16 East Bay suburbs
of San Francisco. "Perception is catching up with reality. People
do have a sense of feeling safer."

In a 1992 Gallup survey, only 19% thought crime in their own areas
had lessened over the previous year. But in this new poll, nearly
half, 48%, say there's less crime in their neighborhoods than
last year. It's the first time in 10 different years of asking
that question that Gallup found a majority of Americans saying
crime is going down in their home locales.

The FBI statistics are "seeping through to people," says Frank
Newport, editor-in-chief of the Gallup Poll. "But we still don't
even have a majority of Americans who say there's less crime now
than a year ago."

Crime coverage

America's crime perception gap has been fostered, criminologists
say, by a steady drumbeat of alarms: saturation coverage of crime
as news on both television and in newspapers, violent TV dramas
and crime-themed "action" movies, anti-crime political campaigns,
fear-themed marketing by security businesses and, for some, personal
experiences as crime victims.

"I don't think that whether the crime rate is 30% or 300% affects
people as much as the fact that they just heard about their neighbor's
house getting burglarized," says Robert Gardner, a California
security consultant. "Crime still is a large concern, and numbers
are a little ethereal."

Lower crime is relative. The rates of major crimes -- the number
of crimes per 100,000 population -- have fallen dramatically.
But the overall numbers are much higher than in the 1950s because
today's population is bigger.

Last year, Los Angeles recorded its fewest murders in 20 years.
But the body count of 590 in 1997 still was sobering.

"It's great that things are slightly less horrific than they
were yesterday, but things are still horrific," says David Beatty,
public policy director for the National Victim Center, a nonprofit
group that works for crime victims' rights. "It's better than
seeing (the crime rate) go up 5% or 10%. But to be honest with
you, there are still 9 million violent crime victims in this country.
When you're that far behind, the sense that (crime) is going down
at all really doesn't give you that much solace."

Besides, feeling safer from crime often depends on where you live.
In crime-ridden areas where a mix of stepped-up policing and neighborhood
activism have dramatically lowered crime rates, residents notice
it in a big way. But in locales where there never was much crime
to begin with, reports of worse crime elsewhere can make them
feel it's rampant, even if they're not personally threatened.

"You don't notice (crime) out here," says Craig First, 31, an
optical technician from Concord, Mass., the famous colonial village
and now an affluent Boston suburb. "This is a very quiet place.
People have home security systems and all sorts of devices on
their cars, but that's because of their lifestyle. That won't
change because crime goes down."

The most significant drop in serious crime in the 1990s is in
major cities, not the suburbs or the countryside. Preliminary
FBI figures for last year show the overall crime index dropped
5% in cities of 250,000 people or more, compared with 3% in suburban
counties and just 1% in rural counties.

"For most people, when the crime rate went up, they were not
any less safe because the crime was not in their neighborhoods,"
says Alfred Blumstein, a professor of research and public policy
at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.

Skeptics say crime stats also lend a false sense of security.
They note that the Department of Justice's National Crime Victimization
Survey, which gathers data from victims' points of view, estimated
in 1996 that only 42% of violent crime was reported to the police.

Police crime counts are what the FBI uses to calculate the crime
index. Doubters note recent news stories that police in Philadelphia,
Atlanta and Boca Raton, Fla., allegedly manipulated or falsely
reported crime figures to keep up with pressure to deliver lower
numbers.

What's more, the reports track only major categories of violent
or serious crime. Left out are less serious but highly visible
offenses: most drug crimes, prostitution, graffiti and vandalism.
Such crimes often heighten awareness and fear in everyday life.

The high-profile deadliness of random crime, a staple on the nightly
news and daily front pages, also skews the fear factor. Think
of carjackings and home invasions. Remember Ennis Cosby and Polly
Klaas. Or schoolyards in Jonesboro, Ark.; Springfield, Ore.; Pearl,
Miss., and West Paducah, Ky.

After last spring's heavily publicized string of school shootings,
"all of a sudden, people are getting the impression as they see
what's going on that there are no safe places," says violence
researcher Delbert Elliott, director of the University of Colorado
Center for the Study and Prevention of Violence.

Carnegie Mellon's Blumstein says most people react not to statistics
but to "singular events that they themselves may identify with."
He cites the case in 1993 of Polly Klaas, a 12-year-old California
girl kidnapped from her bedroom, then raped and murdered.

"That really set people on edge," Blumstein says. "If it's
two kids in a poverty area shooting at each other with weapons
they may have stolen, it doesn't affect an individual's sense
of risk. But if some deranged individual sneaks into your house
and abducts your daughter, that can happen to any of us."

Who gets credit?

How and why crime has fallen is a source of endless debate for
politicians, police, crime scholars and community activists. Some
credit a strong economy where low unemployment means fewer people
resorting to crime. Others credit community police patrols. The
litany goes on: Drug-crime crackdowns. More cops to bust criminals.
More criminals doing more time in more prisons. A smaller population
in the "crime-prone" ages from mid-teens to mid-20s. Neighborhood
"watch" patrols. Cleanup of blighted city blocks, graffiti and
broken windows.

Whatever the reason, the effect of lower crime on everyday life
shows up in ways both stark and subtle.

In high-profile places such as New York and Los Angeles, sheer
size makes major crime more commonplace -- and its decline all
the more noticeable.

Redeveloped downtowns in Denver and other growth cities are refilling
with shoppers by day, diners and concertgoers by night and a new
cadre of full-time dwellers in lofts and high-rises.

In Atlanta, waiter David Borgiet, mugged one night last August
as he walked home, says he was actually victimized because his
Midtown neighborhood is safer. With a local economic boom
came a greater police presence and a greater sense of security.
His caution had eased.

"I knew that area was pretty busy. It has cleaned up a lot since
I moved here. My guard was down because of all the new development,"
says Borgiet, 28.

"When we wanted to go to the zoo or check out something in San
Diego, we didn't have to go to the extremes of the last 10 years.
We felt a lot more comfortable," says Tracy McBryde, 33, a former
Southern Californian who recently moved to Rittman, Ohio. "Before,
you had to make sure you were back before dark, or make sure you
were parked under really bright lights. I couldn't carry a purse
(downtown). I'd put my things in my pockets."

In urban pockets reclaimed from drugs, violence or neglect, real
estate prices are rising. It's not just because of the United
States' bull run of prosperity this decade. Home sellers and buyers
say the drop in crime is a key reason.

"My office, we're getting 300 calls a day," says Willie Katherine
Suggs, a real estate broker in New York's Harlem district, where
refurbished Victorian brownstones can now fetch more than $ 700,000.
Suggs credits community policing programs, begun under Mayor David
Dinkins and fostered by Mayor Rudy Giuliani, as a major contribution
to the neighborhood turnaround.

"Some people still think Harlem is one big slum," says Suggs,
whose clients come in all colors and income levels. "But I've
got an Academy Award-winning producer looking (for a home) here,
an Emmy-nominated actress looking here. People aren't stupid.
They're not going to live where they don't feel safe."

While Giuliani's high-profile campaign against crime has boosted
tourism to record levels and improved the quality of life, no
one seems to be abandoning caution and good sense in the nation's
largest city.

At closing time, New York merchants still cover their storefronts
with roll-down metal grates or doors. Even if crime is down, "it's
too late to change. Better safe," says Andy Azzaro, owner of
Top Man barbershop in Greenwich Village.

Boston was in the spotlight recently for its remarkable 21/2-year
period without any gun-related deaths of youths. But all decade
long, serious crime has plunged, a 44% dive since 1990. Citizens
have definitely noticed.

In 1995, a survey of 1,003 Boston adults by the police department
found 55% felt safe walking alone in their neighborhoods at night.
Last year, police put the same question to 3,000 residents and
got a startling new result: 76% said they felt safe.

Boston police credit aggressive "community policing," a popular
'90s law enforcement philosophy in which officers walk beats and
get to know neighborhoods and residents closely.

Skeptics suggest skyrocketing rents, which have pushed poor people
out of town, are a less publicized factor. "Rent control is gone,
and the cost of having a home here has tripled," says Jack Litwinsky,
40, a university clerk from Cambridge. "I worry about that more
than crime."

Boston had a record 152 homicides in 1990. Last year, there were
43, the fewest in 37 years. Through 10 months of this year, the
count was just 31.

Boston garden designer Tony Stanley doesn't pay much attention
to news of crime's decline. "I lock my doors when I go out, that
sort of thing. But I'd do that regardless of crime statistics,"
says Stanley, 29. "Why invite trouble?"

But Stanley, who teaches karate part time, connects the drop to
a subtle change in his martial-arts clientele: "Lately people
say they're coming for lessons because they're interested in health
and sport and the artistry of it. They almost never mention self-defense
these days."

On the opposite coast, community policing works in the San Francisco
suburb of Union City, Calif., population 62,490, where there hasn't
been a murder in three years. The police department has mini-stations
in two neighborhoods once rife with crime.

Small successes beget greater ones. In 1994, pizza parlors quit
delivering in the Gonzales Gardens public housing project in Columbia,
S.C., because of rampant robberies. The next year, police opened
a substation there and blended community policing with teen tutoring
and a crackdown on school truancy. Today, the pizza deliverers
are back, and schoolkids in the complex of 1,500 residents are
thriving. Truancy is down. Classroom performance is up. Expulsions
have virtually disappeared. School-age pregnancies have plummeted.

Five years ago, noisy street confrontations and gunshots were
the soundtrack of daily life for young Neiasha Jones of Richmond,
Calif., a working-class San Francisco suburb. She and her mother
had just moved into their new home, a Habitat for Humanity house
built in an edgy neighborhood. Directly across the street was
a crack house.

"The first day, four guys jacked the ice cream man. Hit him upside
the head with a brick," recalls Jones, then just 12. Within days,
thieves dug up and hauled off the shrubs that Habitat volunteers
had planted in her front yard.

The house has a nice front porch, says Jones' mother, Charlene
Young, 51, a records analyst at San Quentin federal prison a few
miles away. "But I didn't go outside. I went to work in the prison,
and Neiasha was in 'prison' at home."

But police eventually increased patrols and cracked down on the
crackhouse. The landlord cleaned up the property, and the block
came back. Jones is so spooked now by the calm that she can't
be home without having the radio or TV playing as background noise.

"It's so quiet I can't stand it," she says.

On the screen

The closest brush most Americans have with crime is a daily occurrence:
They turn on their TV sets.

Declining crime statistics don't mean much when news coverage
or dramatization of horrifying acts slashes across the screen.

Darold Condra, 67, a melon grower in rural Arbuckle, Calif., has
a typical response: "Where's the crime rate going down?"

"We get all the Sacramento TV news reports," says Condra, who
farms about 50 miles northwest of the state capital. "It seems
like the news is full of (crime) every night."

James Fox, criminal justice dean at Northeastern University in
Boston, says despite double-digit drops in crime, "a few grisly
stories on the 11 o'clock news would have a much greater impact
on people's fears and perceptions. The evening news is more the
crime-time news than the prime-time news."

The USA TODAY/CNN/Gallup Poll found 82% of respondents believe
TV news and entertainment programs show more crime and violence
than five years ago. Recent studies of local and network programming
also suggest that, even as the crime rate drops, crime and violence
get far more air time than other topics.

The Center for Media and Public Affairs, a Washington, D.C.-based
group that monitors TV reporting of major news, found network
coverage of murder rose 336% from 1990 to 1995, even after excluding
the O.J. Simpson case. (Include that one, and the increase is
1,352%.)

During the same period, actual homicides fell 13%. The center
calls this a "TV crime wave," with crime by far the most heavily
reported subject of the decade on network news.

Since 1995, Rocky Mountain Media Watch, a Denver-based group,
has measured local TV news content in four spot surveys of dozens
of major cities.

It found that time devoted to crime stories far outstripped any
other category of news.

In a survey of 102 local newscasts last March, crime took 27%
of the air time, more than twice the next closest category.

Crime stories led off 38 telecasts, evoking the broadcast cliche,
"If it bleeds, it leads."

Barbara Cochran, president of the Radio Television News Directors
Association, contends that broadcast news chiefs are putting more
crime stories in proper context, "not so much to report crime
but to talk about crime solutions." The group's annual convention
in September even included a panel discussion on covering crime
and tragedy more responsibly.

"Crime is always going to be interesting news," Cochran adds.
"But I see signs that news directors are taking steps to make
crime coverage relevant. Certainly a diet of meaningless crime
stories is not going to succeed in the long run with the audience."

Research by University of Pennsylvania professor George Gerbner,
an expert on the long-term effect of TV on how people view the
world, found heavy watchers are more likely to believe crime is
rising, that their neighborhoods are unsafe and that they themselves
will be targets.

Gerbner, now at Temple University in Philadelphia, calls this
the "mean-world syndrome," the feeling that it's more dangerous
out there than it really is.

Predictions for future

Even if the 1990s' remarkable decline in crime continues, don't
count on a magical transformation of society into Utopia.

"There's not going to be one day where we wake up and aren't
going to be afraid anymore," says Art Lurigio, criminal justice
chairman at Loyola University of Chicago. "(Lower crime) numbers
don't make my heart beat faster. When I walk out of my house and
see a bunch of scary teen-agers on my corner, that's what makes
my heart beat faster."

Lawrence Sherman, criminology chairman at the University of Maryland,
adds: "As (sociologist) Emil Dirkheim said a century ago, our
perception of crime will remain constant even in a society of
saints."

Sherman does think that if the United States retains its "security-mindedness"
as the population ages, "it is quite plausible that we could
see declining crime rates well into the next millennium."

Others note demographic projections that the most crime-prone
age group -- mid-teens to mid-20s -- will peak numerically in
the coming decade.

Some expect crime will spiral back up as a result, though that
effect is hotly and widely disputed among crime researchers.

"It's great that the floodwaters are down to our knees now, but
I'm afraid that the next demographic wave is going to swamp us,"
says Beatty of the National Victim Center.

In the end, everyday folk may not pay much heed to the experts
or the numbers.

Jeanie Hewitt, 28, an artist in Boston's Jamaica Plain neighborhood,
says she has noticed the city feels safer, but adds, "Who really
cares about the crime rate?"

Her view is pragmatic and fatalistic.

"Crime is related to the economy," Hewitt says. "When times
are good, no crime. When times are bad, crime goes up. It's the
way of the world, and you just have to accept it."

Drop in Murder Rate Accelerates in Cities; District, P.G. County Among Leaders
in Trend

Roberto Suro, Washington Post Staff Writer

LENGTH: 1093 words


Many of America's largest cities experienced sharp declines in homicides in
1997, continuing, even accelerating, a drop in violent crime that first emerged
at the beginning of the decade and has transformed the quality of urban life in
some parts of the country.

Some of the most pronounced reductions in the murder count occurred in the
District, Prince George's County and the nation's two largest cities, Los
Angeles and New York, where the number of killings dropped by more than 20
percent compared with last year and hit levels not seen in decades.

As of Monday, D.C. police had recorded 301 homicides, compared with 397 last
year, a 24 percent drop. In Prince George's County, there have been 81 homicides
this year as of Monday compared with 134 on that date last year, a 40 percent
drop.

The nation's big cities have led a national trend that has produced an overall
decline in violent crime for the past six years, but the steep drops registered
this year exceeded the expectations -- and even the explanations -- of many law
enforcement officials and criminologists.

In New York, which experienced 2,262 homicides in 1992, the 755 killings
registered as of Monday for this year marked the lowest number since 1967. Los
Angeles had recorded 566 homicides as of mid-December, a 20 percent drop
compared with 1996. The city has not experienced fewer than 600 since 1977 and
as recently as 1993 could count on hitting the 1,000 mark every year.

Nationwide, homicides declined by 9 percent in the first half of 1997, and
violent crime overall was down by 5 percent, according to preliminary counts by
the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting Program.

A wide variety of factors including higher rates of incarceration, a strong
economy, a shrinking youth population and more effective police strategies are
being cited to explain the broad reduction in violent crime registered
nationwide. But no single factor seems to explain the sustained pace of the
decline.

"All the usual explanations do not really account for why we are seeing such
sharp drops now on top of several years of decreased crimes," said Cheryl
Maxson, a research associate at the University of Southern California's Social
Science Research Institute.

Violent crime began increasing in the early 1960s and increased steadily for 20
years. It had just begun to drop in the early 1980s when a dramatic crime wave
took hold, which criminologists broadly associated with the crack cocaine
epidemic. Now, experts say, with this year's declines the crime rate should drop
to where it was in the early 1980s, and in some cities to the lowest levels
since the 1970s.

"Just as the upward trend had the snowballing quality of an epidemic, the
declines we are now experiencing also appear to have developed a momentum of
their own," said Alfred Blumstein, professor of public policy at Carnegie Mellon
University.

"We had a period in which guns were increasingly common on the streets and gun
violence became increasingly acceptable," Blumstein said. "That had the effect
of a spreading contagion that was most visible in homicide rates. Now guns are
less common and there is a greater price to be paid for gun violence and that is
having a similar effect."

Blumstein and others also noted that, with fewer crimes to solve, police have
more time and resources both to track down the remaining criminals and to engage
in community policing and other initiatives designed to prevent crime. Under
major anti-crime legislation enacted in 1994, the federal government has
provided funding for some 70,000 new slots on state and local police forces.

"As crime drops, police have a greater opportunity to attack crime
aggressively," Blumstein said.

New York, Blumstein noted, has added about 5,000 officers to its force in the
past five years and, with less violent crime to tackle now, these police are
able to carry out initiatives like a stop-and-frisk campaign designed to take
concealed weapons off the streets in particularly troubled areas.

In the District, police have attributed this year's drop in homicides to an
aggressive crackdown on illegal weapons and a renewed attention to
quality-of-life crimes, both initiatives copied from strategies developed in New
York City. Many problems remain, however. Washington continues to experience an
exceptionally high number of homicides for a city of its size.

The nationwide decline in crime has also had an impact on how ordinary citizens
attempt to counteract violence, according to some experts. "As violence becomes
less prevalent and as communities become safer, there are ever greater
opportunities for neighborhood groups, churches and other such organizations to
exercise informal social controls and to work more effectively with the police,"
said Maxson. "Over time that will change the nature of a community in ways that
bring further reductions in crime."

Homicide rates appear to be closely linked to a city's economic condition,
according to a National Institute of Justice research project that examined
long-term homicide trends in eight cites. Poverty rates and homicide rates
appear to move in the same direction, and increased unemployment also appears to
be tied to increases in murder, the study found. However, there does not appear
to be a link to the distribution of income across a city's households as
increasingly unequal distribution of wealth in a city does not coincide with
increases in murder rates.

The recently published study also concluded that crack cocaine is the only drug
that is uniformly associated with violent crime, especially homicide.

Finally, the study by the institute, which is a research arm of the Justice
Department, concluded that there appears to be statistical support for the
argument that tougher sentencing and probation practices have helped produce
lower crime rates.

"Analysis of net inmate flows into and out of prison suggests that net increases
in prison detentions were linked with declines in homicides while net increases
in prison releases were linked with homicide rates," the institute officials
concluded.

While nationwide figures from individual counties were not yet available,
locally, Fairfax County reports 16 homicides so far this year, up from 14 last
year. Alexandria saw a drop from seven last year to five so far this year.
Mostly rural Loudoun County saw an increase from one homicide in 1996 to three
in 1997 so far.

Staff writers Philip P. Pan, Michael Powell and Linda Perlstein contributed to
this report.

Drug war is not racist

BYLINE: William Wilbanks

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 8A

LENGTH: 312 words


The articles claiming that the drug war is racist represent one-sided advocacy
reporting unworthy of USA TODAY.

USA TODAY focuses on the allegedly excessive 4-1 black-white arrest ratio
without pointing out that this ratio is equal to or less than the black-white
arrest ratio for all FBI "index" crimes, violent crimes, property crimes,
murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny and car theft.

No one questions the 10-1 black-white "murder gap" given the reliability of the
"body count" and that murder is intraracial. And the black-white offending
ratios for other crimes, measured by the national victim survey, suggest that
"arrest gaps" are not due to police bias.

USA TODAY says there is no black-white drug use gap and thus the 4-1 drug arrest
gap is proof of institutional racism. But the claim is based on a survey which
did not include the very persons - criminals, homeless, the very poor, inmates -
most likely to be involved in hard drug use and criminal activity.

USA TODAY did not point out that the sex gap in drug use is only 2-1 while the
gap for arrests is 5-1. The difference is not sex discrimination but because
female drug users are less often involved in crimes that subject them to arrest.
The same fact applies to ratios by race.

USA TODAY's thesis - inequality in black-white arrest ratios represents
institutional racism - is contradicted by numerous facts. "Liberal" cities and
cities with predominantly black police forces often show higher black-white
ratios than "conservative" cities and cities with predominantly white police
forces. Is St. Paul (26-1) 13 times more racist than Los Angeles or New York
(2-1)?

Police drug arrests are responsive to complaints about drug activity, and those
complaints are largely coming from the black community. Police sensitivity to
citizen concerns is not racism.

Public colleges must now report crime statistics

BYLINE: Debbie Howlett; Jennifer Campbell

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 223 words


The USA's public colleges and universities soon may provide a sobering look at
the extent of campus crime.

Under a federal law that took effect Sunday, school officials - often accused of
trying to protect their images by not reporting serious crimes - must provide
statistics for the FBI's annual crime roundup.

''It is important to be up front with exactly what all campuses are like,'' says
Art Sandeen of the University of Florida, which is still reeling from five
slayings last fall.

In the past, insisting on students' privacy, many schools have cited a 1974 law
exempting them from crime reporting.

A series of reports last year in USA TODAY called attention to that practice -
and the explosion of campus crime. In the eight days stories were published, 700
serious crimes were committed on 100 campuses.

A subsequent report revealed that 90% of rapes on campus go unreported and just
one rape in 100 is prosecuted.

Congress responded. But the new law does not apply to private schools nor does
it require that crimes be reported to police. Congress is weighing legislation
requiring public schools to release details of crimes.

Says Sen. Timothy Wirth, D-Colo., the bill's sponsor: ''With the growth of
campus crime this is no time ... to prevent students and communities from
knowing about criminal activity.''

Violent crime on the rise in U.S.

BYLINE: Steven Edwards, CanWest News Service

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. C12

LENGTH: 585  words

DATELINE: NEW YORK


NEW YORK -- The United States became a more dangerous place in 2005, with more
murders, robberies and aggravated assaults leading the largest annual rise in
the violent crime rate since 2001, the FBI reported Monday.

The number of murder victims exceeded 16,900 while there were at least 92,837
forcible rapes and almost 420,000 robberies.

Among big U.S. cities, Dallas emerged as the most dangerous, with economically
depressed Detroit a close second, while New York again enjoyed being dubbed the
safest.

Experts differed on whether the statistics show the United States to be
significantly more dangerous than Canada, with one leading scholar arguing most
crime rates are similar except for homicide.

"The U.S. is higher in gun crime, but Canada has higher burglary rates, it has
higher theft rates, it has equivalent assault rates: it is a high crime
society," said Marcus Felson, professor at the School of Criminal Justice of
Rutgers University in Newark, N.J. "Western Canada is a very high crime society,
while Eastern Canada is moderate like New York, but that's partly for the wrong
reason, namely it is too cold in winter to commit much crime."

Statistics Canada will release Canada's 2005 crime statistics next month, but
annually warns against comparing them with the FBI list because the Canadian
roundup considers a greater number of violent offences.

The murder rate in the United States shot up 4.8 per cent last year, marking the
highest percentage increase in 15 years. The robbery rate rose 4.5 per cent, but
the number of forcible rapes reported dipped by 1.9 per cent.

The overall trend bucks a general decline throughout the 1990s, but individual
spikes are explainable.

For example, the arrival in Houston of thousands of people fleeing Hurricane
Katrina-ravaged New Orleans -- long known as a high crime city -- could have
contributed to the 23 per cent rise in the Texas city's murder rate, to 334 from
272.

"When new teenagers show up, they upset the pecking order," said Felson, whose
latest book, Crime and Nature, explores crime's symbiotic relationships with
society's legal activities.

Rapidly growing Las Vegas saw a 10 per cent increase in its murder rate, to 144
from 131, but continued economic decline accompanied a 14 per cent rise in the
number of murders in Philadelphia, where there were 377 victims, up from 330.

"Philadelphia has more abandoned property than any city in America, and
Baltimore is second," said Felson. "So you have whole areas of the city that are
like a war zone. Not only is abandoned property used for crime, but there is no
one living and working there to look after the street."

The now-cooling housing boom and rising property prices meant developers snapped
up abandoned property in many other cities.

"Redevelopment was most marked in New York: Times Square was once a generator of
crime, but that is no longer the case," Felson said.

More than 12,000 law enforcement agencies submitted reports to the FBI, which
will release a more comprehensive review in the fall.

In New York, Mayor Michael Bloomberg credited the continued fall in the violent
crime rate to tougher policing and his drive to get illegal guns off the
streets. The entire Northeast showed the least marked rise in violent crime,
contrasting sharply with the Midwest, where there was an overall 5.7 per cent
increase.

In Canada, there were 622 murders in 2004 , representing two for every 100,000
people. Some experts claim Canada's universal health-care system does a better
job at saving lives.

50 `eyes' on crime in north Minneapolis;
Safety cameras will go up this summer to spot crime on the city's North Side.
South Minneapolis has had success.

BYLINE: Terry Collins, Staff Writer

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 5B

LENGTH: 493 words


Hoping to replicate the early success of crime-fighting technology on the city's
South Side, the Minneapolis City Council on Friday approved a plan to install a
$1 million safety camera system on the North Side.

The council unanimously voted for 50 cameras to go up in June in an area
bordered by W. Broadway, and Lowry, Lyndale and Penn Avenues N. Police and
volunteers will monitor the cameras at the Police Department's Fourth Precinct
headquarters.

"It's been long overdue. We're excited," said Council Member Don Samuels, whose
ward includes the area that will have cameras. "I had to exercise patience and
encourage my constituents to do the same. We have now been rewarded for that.

"I anticipate great results."

Although violent crime in Minneapolis is down about 16 percent compared with
this time last year, 11 of the city's 14 homicides this year have occurred on
the North Side.

The cameras in north Minneapolis will work in sync with the city's other crime
-fighting technology tool, ShotSpotter, which is a series of sensors that can
pinpoint the location of gunshots so officers can respond more quickly.
ShotSpotter was introduced on the North Side earlier this month.

Since then, one man was charged with reckless discharge of a firearm and police
found a shooting victim within a minute of being shot.

Both crime-fighting tech tools were installed in south Minneapolis within the
past year and have been widely praised for helping reduce crime there.

Other major cities with similar crime-camera programs include Chicago,
Baltimore, New York and New Orleans. San Francisco, Philadelphia and Newark,
N.J., are planning to install them.

While police in Chicago and Baltimore credit their camera systems with reducing
crime, cities such as Orlando, Oakland, Calif., and Jackson, Miss., have
abandoned part or all of their systems.

London, with some 6,000 safety cameras, is widely considered to have the most
extensive system in the world.

In other business

- Spray paint: The council passed an ordinance that requires stores not to sell
spray paint to those 17 and younger in an effort to help curb the city's growing
graffiti problem.

- Anti-graffiti program: The council also accepted a $42,500 grant from the
National Council to Prevent Delinquency to fund a pilot program. Teens will be
hired to work undercover this summer to see which businesses are selling spray
paint to minors.

- NRP: After a lengthy debate, the council passed a measure recommending that
the Legislature not take action this year on a House bill that would extend the
city's Neighborhood Revitalization Program (NRP) 20 years past its 2009
expiration. The council insists it needs more time to discuss the program's
governance structure and funding.

Mayor R.T. Rybak said that while the program has improved Minneapolis since it
was implemented in the early 1990s, the city has changed and there should be
talks about a program that reflects those changes.

AUGUSTA'S MURDER RATE DROPS

BYLINE: By Jeremy Craig Staff Writer

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B01

LENGTH: 334 words


If you live in the Augusta area, you're far more likely to get your home broken
into than get killed.

But the likelihood of injury to your property is increasing, the FBI's newest
crime statistics show.

The FBI released its annual report on the nation's crime this week, and it shows
decreasing crime rates for the nation as a whole.

Augusta's murder rate per 100,000 people fell by half, as did the national
violent crime rate. But property crimes per 100,000 people in the Augusta metro
area increased 8 percent, the FBI data state.

Richmond County Sheriff Ronnie Strength said he hadn't had a chance to look at
the new statistics.

"I would definitely want to compare them to our figures," he said.

Nationally, the property-crime rate is down by 2 percent, with 3,517 property
crimes per 100,000 people.

For 2004, the FBI did not show statistics for violent crimes per 100,000 for the
Augusta metro area, which includes Burke, Columbia, McDuffie, Richmond, Aiken
and Edgefield counties.

Violent crimes are not limited to homicide, but include aggravated assaults,
robberies, rapes and other crimes.

Officials with the FBI's Criminal Justice Information Services Division in West
Virginia, which keeps track of national crime statistics, said Burke County
officials had trouble reporting aggravated assault figures, so no concrete
violent crime rate was reported.

The data did show that Richmond County had 830 cases of violent crime. In 2003,
there were 1,039 violent crime cases in Richmond County.

Augusta has one of the lowest homicide rates in Georgia, with only 3.9 cases per
100,000 people. By contrast, Atlanta reported a rate of about 8; Savannah had a
rate of about 9; and Columbus had the highest murder rate, about 11 cases per
100,000 people.

In South Carolina, the metropolitan area with the highest crime rates in 2004
was Florence, with a violent crime rate of about 1,132 per 100,000 people, and a
property crime rate of 6,130.

States hear call to action

BYLINE: By Andrea Stone, USA TODAY, Contributing: Haya El Nasser

SECTION: THE NATION; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 319 words


State lawmakers eager to allay fears over violence are making crime a top
legislative priority in 1994.

And not just in big states, like New York and California.

Dozens of proposals -- from more prisons and mandatory sentences to gun
licensing and taxes on ammunition -- will be weighed in state legislatures
nationwide.  Among them:

* More than 20 states will address youth crime and violence, says the National
Conference of State Legislatures.  Juvenile conviction rates have remained
stable, but crimes by youths "have grown more violent and involve younger
offenders," the group says.

Alaska, Arizona, Connecticut, Florida, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Utah and
Washington are most likely to pass stiffer penalties for juvenile offenders, the
group says.

Most likely to take action against gang violence: Arizona, Missouri and
Wisconsin.

* At least 12 states will consider gun-control measures, including longer
waiting periods, licensing taxes, limits on purchases, juvenile possession bans
and adult liability laws.

The National Rifle Association, which opposes gun control, says it's pushing
crime bills in 36 states.

Among the NRA's priorities: bills that require life sentences for three-time
violence felons.

* In Washington state, proposed laws include felony charges for adults who sell
or provide handguns to minors.

* Ohio Gov. George Voinovich Wednesday introduced a package that includes
tougher penalties for crimes against children.  He also asked for a referendum
to reduce appeal time in death-penalty cases.

"People are scared," GOP consultant Eddie Mahe Jr. says.  "We're in one of those
one-upmanship games to see who's . . . toughest," Democrats or Republicans.

Politicians "focus on the three R's: revenge, retaliation and retribution,
because that gets them the fourt R -- reelected," says James Fox, dean of
criminal justice at Northeastern University.

Tough talk has a price: More money

BYLINE: Robert Davis

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 6A

LENGTH: 405 words


A USA TODAY/CNN/ Gallup Poll shows most Americans want to get tougher on crime -
especially violent crime.

But experts disagree on whether the public should be forced to pay for a new war
on crime.

Being tough on crime often means more taxes, especially when it means adding
police or keeping violent offenders in overcrowded prisons.

The poll found that 82% of respondents want tougher terms for parole; 79% want
tougher sentences for all crimes; and 75% want tougher bail requirements for
people accused of violent crimes.

Of 1,244 people polled, 80% favor putting more police on the streets - even if
it requires higher taxes.

Chuck Wexler, director of the Police Executive Research Forum, says spending
more tax dollars on police won't necessarily cause a drop in crime.

"Police do a very good job now," he says. But "without significant resources
both before and after the crime, we're just constantly running in place."

For example, Wexler says, more money could be spent on training police to become
community leaders in fighting crime.

But being more creative about crime prevention will do even more, Wexler says.

He proposes anti-crime strategies that range from targeting violent repeat
offenders to designing safer buildings to live and work in.
"The reality is, whatever we've been doing hasn't been effective," Wexler says.
"Simply adding to it without changing the structure won't fix it."

Former Justice Department official Paul McNulty agrees with those polled who say
more prison time is one solution.

But there's a catch, says McNulty, head of the First Freedom Coalition, a group
pushing for criminal justice reforms: "There is not enough space."

Because the USA's prisons and jails are overcrowded - nearing a record 1 million
inmates - violent offenders are serving only an average of 37% of their
sentences.

Residents of crime-plagued neighborhoods can point out thugs for police, McNulty
says, but "they lock them up and they're right back out."

McNulty doesn't believe more taxes are needed.

"Leaders need to ask people what the priorities should be. I think the first
thing the public would say is protect us," put criminals in prison and keep them
there.

Jim Baker, chief lobbyist for the National Rifle Association, says the poll
results reflect a "sea change" in public attitudes.

"People are sick and tired of elected officials just giving lip service to the
problem."

Crime's up in 'Anytown, USA' // Cited: More guns and gangs

BYLINE: Sam Vincent Meddis

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 340 words


Reports of murder soared 7% last year - part of what police are calling a
''scary'' crime scene on the nation's streets.

According to preliminary 1991 crime statistics released Sunday by the FBI, total
crimes reported to police increased 3% - with violent crime showing a 5% rise
and property crime up 2%.

''The citizens are scared,'' says Lt. Burton Poe, spokesman for the Fort Worth
Police Department. ''It's not just the city of Fort Worth - it's Anytown, USA.''

Fueling the increase: More gangs, guns and drugs on the streets, along with
greater numbers of convicts released early from prisons because of crowding,
says Poe.

The 5% rise in violent crime was about half the 11% increase in violent crime
during 1989-90 and more closely mirrored the annual violent crime increases from
1987-89.

The preliminary FBI Uniform Crime Report - final numbers are out this summer -
also found:

- Robbery, up 8%.

- Forcible rape and serious assault, up 3%.

- Burglary, up 3%.

- Larceny and motor vehicle theft, up 2%.

Washington bears much of the blame for failing to pass a tough new federal crime
bill, stalled in Congress because of election-year politics, says Dewey Stokes,
president of the 237,000-member National Fraternal Order of Police.

''The president calls it a war on drugs and crime,'' says Stokes. ''I feel we're
going to war with one hand tied behind our back.''

While law enforcement is important, fighting poverty and drug addiction,
particularly among young people, is the key, says Hubert Williams of the Police
Foundation, a police research organization.

''We've (already) been building prisons at a phenomenal rate and making enormous
amounts of arrests,'' he says.

Crime rose 3% to 4% in all regions except the Northeast where violent crime
dropped 1% and reports of property crime were stable.

An explanation: Young people prone to street crimes may have migrated to other
areas due to the region's long-term economic downturn, says Jay Albanese,
criminologist at Niagara University in New York.

Reported violent crime on college campuses in the region increased by 10 to 20
percent in 1993 from 1992, according to the F.B.I.'s index crime statistics. The
Federal Right-to-Know and Campus Security Act, which took effect in 1992,
requires colleges and universities that receive Federal funds to make public
their security policies and the number of reported on-campus crimes. Reported
property crimes, which vastly outnumber violent crimes, declined in 1993. Making
intercampus comparisons is difficult, as statistics are affected by several
factors: the characteristics of the surrounding community, accessibility of the
campus to visitors, enrollment, and so on. But the large state university
campuses in the area had similar crime rates in 1993.

Dayton crime dropped in 2009;
Only homicides rose last year, but those are down early this year.

BYLINE: By Tom Beyerlein Staff Writer

SECTION: MAIN; Pg. A1

LENGTH: 223 words


DAYTON - Crime fell in every category last year except homicide , and police
Chief Richard Biehl says there is even good news in that category.

After leading the state in the homicide rate in 2009, incidents are down 40
percent - nine this year versus 15 at this time last year.

"Homicide is the smallest portion of violent crime overall," Biehl said. "The
number of homicides year to year does not define whether a community is safe or
not."

Dayton had a 2009 homicide rate of 2.55 per 10,000 population, the highest of
the six largest Ohio cities, including Akron (0.97), Cincinnati (1.65),
Cleveland (1.84), Columbus (0.96) and Toledo (1.13), a Dayton Daily News
analysis shows.

Dayton had 39 homicides last year, up from 34 in 2008, but the 2009 numbers were
down markedly for forcible rape, aggravated assault, property crime and motor
vehicle theft. There were smaller declines in robbery, burglary, theft and
arson.

Biehl credits the decrease in violent crime to police efforts to fight gun
crimes.

Nationwide, violent crime was down 5.5 percent, while property crime declined by
4.9 percent, the FBI reported. All four categories of violent crime - homicide
and non-negligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated assault -
declined.

Like Dayton, Cincinnati and Columbus had lower numbers in most of the FBI's 10
categories.

CRIME STATISTICS MISLEAD

SECTION: EDITORIAL; Pg. A8

LENGTH: 544 words


If there was confusion last week about crime in Hartford, it is understandable.
The Courant ran a Page 1 story on Jan. 9 reporting that homicides in the city
had risen to 33, a level last reached during the gang violence of the mid-1990s.
Later that morning, Mayor Eddie A. Perez held a news conference to announce that
crime in the city had fallen to its lowest level in 30 years.

The conundrum is that both were right, as far as they went.

Mr. Perez said there were 1,600 fewer serious crimes last year than in 2006, a
decrease of 15.5 percent. That is true but misleading. Most of the decline in
Hartford crime was the result of an administrative order from Gov. M. Jodi Rell
in 2005 requiring that motor vehicle registration stickers be put inside
windshields instead of on license plates. Hartford had about 1,300 fewer stolen
license plates last year. This is a good thing - stolen plates were a real
nuisance - but take those numbers out of the mix and crime is down just a bit.

In the area of violent crime, robberies and aggravated assaults were down in
2007, but rapes and murders were up. Murders went from 24 in 2006 to 32 last
year. (Police said one of the 33 homicides was determined to have been
justified.) Meanwhile, murder rates fell in all the state's other large cities
and in New York, Boston and Chicago. Hartford had as many homicides in 2007 as
Stamford, New Haven, Waterbury and Bridgeport combined.

We are not unsympathetic to Mr. Perez's efforts to put the best face on the
problem and counter the impression that the city is unsafe. He is largely
correct. Most of the violent crime is drug-related and not directed at
law-abiding strangers or residents (though they are subject to property crime).
Complaints from residents tend much more toward quality-of-life issues such as
noise, speeding or litter rather than violent crime.

Nonetheless, Mr. Perez should realize that touting reductions in crime when
murders have increased verges on Orwellian absurdity. The mayor should point his
police department in the direction of the homicides.

Let's be clear. The real scourge here is the drug problem and the decades-long
failure of the war on drugs, the Vietnam of domestic policy. In cities such as
Hartford, drugs drive so much of the crime. Dealers shoot one another. Dealers
rip off addicts who come to the city from the suburbs. Drug-addled prostitutes
who don't get paid charge johns with rape. Addicts steal to feed their habits.

Absent an effort to change the way we deal with illegal drugs, the police have
to deal with the results. Police Chief Daryl K. Roberts is pushing for tougher
penalties for gun crimes, as he should. Police seized nearly 400 guns last year,
evidence that the gun has become the dispute-resolution tool of choice for many
of the city's lost boys. Mr. Roberts also is working with state and federal
authorities on drug and firearm crime. He has a quality-of-life initiative that
the General Assembly should support with funding.

He should increase these efforts, look for programs that have worked in other
cities and devote more resources to solving murders, if necessary. Though
progress has been made in other areas, the mayor isn't going to sell the notion
that the city is safer until the murder rate goes down.

We were robbed -- again! Big Apple atop FBI crime list

BYLINE: Leslie Griffy, Mercury News

SECTION: A; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 757 words


Could the Big Apple actually be safer than the Capital of Silicon Valley?

Yes, according to the FBI.

The latest crime statistics rank New York as the safest big city in the country
for the second year in a row. San Jose -- which has been touting itself for
years as the safest big city in America based on an independent company's crime
tally -- came in second.

On average, for every 37.4 New Yorkers, one crime is reported to police,
according to the FBI's 2005 figures on major property and violent crimes. San
Jose police receive one crime report for every 34.5 residents.

``Way to go!'' said Ian Montgomery, a former New Yorker who moved to the Bay
Area last year. He attributes the lower crime rate in New York to both political
leadership that led to a crackdown on crime and a sense of community the city
discovered after Sept. 11.

Still, exactly who can claim the title of America's safest big city depends on
what you mean by safe. And big. And maybe even what you mean by America.

``You can slice the data in a lot of ways,'' San Jose mayor's representative
David Vossbrink said. ``I am sure that some cities will say that they have the
lowest rates for a city between 70,000 to 75,000 population.''

Sure enough, New York City, Newton, Mass., Irvine, Appleton, Wis., and Amherst,
Mass., all claim the title of the safest city in America. Austin modestly brags
of being the third-safest big city in the country.

The title is important to cities because the numbers are a way to quantify
quality of life, Vossbrink said.

``It is something that businesses look at when they look to relocate or
expand,'' he said.

The FBI gathers data on both violent crimes -- murder, forcible rape, robbery
and aggravated assault -- and property crimes -- burglary, larceny-theft, motor
vehicle theft and arson -- that are reported to police. It does not include
certain crimes, such as drug offenses or minor sex crimes.

San Francisco, according to the FBI data, can claim the second-lowest rate of
reported rapes among the big cities. Montgomery, the former New Yorker,
recommends locking up bicycles in Gotham City, but New York has the lowest rate
of reported car thefts.

People in Honolulu are the least likely to be murdered in a big city. The FBI
data shows Honolulu has had a lower violent crime rate than San Jose every year
since 2000. The island city's residents, though, report more property crimes
than San Joseans.

But, perhaps, ``the big city with the lowest overall crime rate in the
continental United States'' doesn't have the same ring as ``America's safest big
city.''

San Jose bases its safest big city claim on an annual report from a Kansas-based
company, Morgan Quitno, that crunches FBI statistics using a formula that weighs
crimes based on their seriousness.

Using that methodology, San Jose has come out tops for large cities each of the
past four years.

Vossbrink points out that New York may have a lower overall crime rate than San
Jose in the newest FBI data, but that the murder rate in San Jose is less than
half of that in the Big Apple.

Adding reports of non-violent crimes like burglary and car theft to the total
also helps push San Jose to the top because of Honolulu's high property crime
rate.

San Jose Police Chief Rob Davis said combining the property and violent crime
rates provides a better picture of what's really going on in a city. But he
adds, ``Obviously all crime is traumatic to the victim,'' he said.

Vossbrink thinks New York City should be in a category by itself because of its
gargantuan size. It has about 8 million residents and 37,800 officers -- one cop
for about every 212 residents -- compared with 910,000 residents and about 1,350
cops in San Jose -- one cop for about every 674 residents.

Honolulu, which is both a city and county, also has about 910,000 residents, but
has 2,100 officers -- one cop for about every 433 residents.

For cities between 500,000 and 1 million, San Jose is still No. 1, according to
the FBI.

And if you list the safest cities of more than 200,000 residents, San Jose still
fares well. San Jose has the 10th-lowest rate of reported violent crime and the
fifth-lowest reported crime rate overall.

It's a public safety record that makes Vossbrink proud.

And, Davis is sure San Jose can retain its Safest Big City title when the Morgan
Quitno report is released later this fall.

Maybe, though, all those stats are missing the point. Where would you feel safer
at 3 a.m.? Times Square or San Jose's Plaza de Cesar Chavez?

New York's murder rate at lowest for over 40 years

BYLINE: James Bone in New York

SECTION: Overseas news; 31

LENGTH: 430 words


NEW YORK, once synonymous with violent crime, is on track to cut its murder rate
from a peak of 2,245 to fewer than 500 this year.

The fall from the 1990 high reflects the city's "zero-tolerance" policing and
its strategy of flooding troubled areas with officers. The decline is boosting
Mayor Michael Bloomberg's chances of re-election in November as a Republican in
a traditionally Democratic city.

Thomas Reppetto, president of the non-profit Citizens Crime Commission, said:
"If you keep working at it, you can continue to reduce crime. The question, of
course, is how low?"

Killings have fallen almost 17 per cent in the city so far this year, to 215
from 259 at the same time in 2004. An analysis by the Daily News predicted
yesterday that, if the trend continues, New York would end the year with just
465 murders, compared with 570 last year.

The last time New York recorded fewer than 500 murders was in 1961, when there
were 482. The murder rate jumped to 548 the following year, beginning an
inexorable rise through the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s that spawned numerous films
about New York's dangerous streets.

The killing of 2,749 people in the World Trade Centre attack on September 11,
2001, was excluded from the crime statistics. When Mr Bloomberg was elected
after the 2001 attack, few thought that he would be able to cut crime. But Ray
Kelly, his Police Commissioner, who had already done the job once before, said
that crime was now at what people once thought were "impossibly low levels".

FBI figures show that New York's per capita murder rate is roughly half that of
Los Angeles and Chicago, a third of Philadelphia's and seven times lower than in
Detroit. Crime has been falling in all categories at almost three times the
national rate, and New York now ranks 221st on the FBI's crime index of 240
American cities with a population of 100,000 or more.

The New York Police Department attributes its success to innovative policing,
including swamping troubled "impact zones". After a surge in shootings in the
Bronx and north Brooklyn, 250 officers were reassigned to the areas. Mr
Bloomberg has also cut crime in the worst schools by deploying police to the
corridors.

Help the Russians: We helped the Germans and Japanese after we won World War II.
So, we're only being consistent when we help feed the Russians now.
William G. Crook
Jackson, Tenn.

 Don't blame colleges for off-campus crime: I read your chronology of what you
refer to as ''campus crime.'' After I read all of the crimes that took place, it
struck me that almost two-thirds (25 out of 43) of the crimes committed took
place off campus and that the only connection to the college or university
mentioned by you is the fact that the victim happens to be a student at a
particular institution. Needless to say, I am very disturbed by the fact that
your paper seems to imply that a college or university should be held
accountable for crimes that occur in a particular town where campus police or
administrative officials have no authority.

It would seem to me that you should title your series, ''Crimes committed
against students'' because that is the only true common denominator in the
article. To hold colleges and universities responsible for crimes committed off
campus is as irresponsible as holding accounting firms responsible for crimes
committed by accountants when they are not at work.

It is a sad fact that crimes do occur on campuses across this country, and that
fact should be recognized and reported on. But this situation should not be made
worse by lumping all crimes committed against students to read as though all of
the crimes are the sole responsibility of the institution. A little more
directness by your paper and less sensationalism would go a long way in bringing
the ''campus crime'' picture into clearer focus for all of us.
Robert A. Pastoor
Mount Saint Mary's College
Emmitsburg, Md.

 Make students aware of campus crime: Your series on campus crime is just
outstanding. The public needs to be aware that colleges are not the ''havens''
that they try to create in their brochures. I believe all freshmen need to have
crime prevention and awareness taught to them during orientation.

El Paso second safest city in country

DETROIT - In another blow to the Motor City's tarnished image, Detroit pushed
past St. Louis to become the nation's most dangerous city, according to a
private research group's controversial analysis, released Sunday, of annual FBI
crime statistics.

The study drew harsh criticism even before it came out. The American Society of
Criminology launched a pre-emptive strike Friday, issuing a statement attacking
it as "an irresponsible misuse" of crime data.

The 14th annual "City Crime Rankings: Crime in Metropolitan America" was
published by CQ Press, a unit of Congressional Quarterly Inc. It is based on the
FBI's Sept. 24 crime statistics report.

The report looked at 378 cities with at least 75,000 people based on per-capita
rates for homicide, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary and auto theft.
Each crime category was considered separately and weighted based on its
seriousness, CQ Press said.

Last year's crime leader, St. Louis, fell to No. 2. Another Michigan city,
Flint, ranked third, followed by Oakland Calif.; Camden, N.J.; Birmingham, Ala.;
North Charleston, S.C.; Memphis, Tenn.; Richmond, Calif.; and Cleveland.

The study ranked Mission Viejo, Calif., as the safest U.S. city, followed by
Clarkstown, N.Y.; Brick Township, N.J.; Amherst, N.Y.; and Sugar Land, Texas.

El Paso was ranked the second safest city with cities of a population of 500,000
or higher. El Paso was the third safest city in the same population grouping
last year.

CQ Press spokesman Ben Krasney said details of the weighting system were
proprietary. It was compiled by Kathleen O'Leary Morgan and Scott Morgan, whose
Morgan Quitno Press published it until its acquisition by CQ Press.

The study assigns a crime score to each city, with zero representing the
national average. Detroit got a score of 407, while St. Louis followed at 406.
The score for Mission Viejo, in affluent Orange County, was minus 82.

Detroit was pegged the nation's murder capital in the 1980s and has lost nearly
1 million people since 1950, according to the Census Bureau. Downtown sports
stadiums and corporate headquarters - along with the redevelopment of the
riverfront of this city of 919,000 - have slowed but not reversed the decline.
Officials have said crime reports don't help.

Detroit police officials released a statement Sunday night disputing the report,
saying it fails to put crime information into proper context."Every year this
organization sends out a press release with big, bold lettering that labels a
certain city as Most Dangerous, USA," Police Chief Ella Bully-Cummings said in
the release.

"It really makes you wonder if the organization is truly concerned with
evaluating crime or increasing their profit," said Bully-Cummings, who noted the
complete report is available only by purchase. "With crime experts across the
country routinely denouncing the findings, I believe the answer is clear."

The mayor of 30th-ranked Rochester, N.Y. - an ex-police chief himself - said the
study's authors should consider the harm that the report causes."What I take
exception to is the use of these statistics and the damage they inflict on a
number of these cities," said Mayor Robert Duffy, chairman of the Criminal and
Social Justice Committee for the U.S. Conference of Mayors.

The rankings "do groundless harm to many communities," said Michael Tonry,
president of the American Society of Criminology.

"They also work against a key goal of our society, which is a better
understanding of crime-related issues by both scientists and the public," Tonry
said.

Critics also complain that numbers don't tell the whole story because of
differences among cities.

"You're not comparing apples and oranges; you're comparing watermelons and
grapes," said Rob Casey, who heads the FBI section that puts out the Uniform
Crime Report that provides the data for the Quitno report.

The FBI posted a statement on its Web site criticizing such use of its
statistics.

"These rough rankings provide no insight into the numerous variables that mold
crime in a particular town, city, county, state, or region," the FBI said.
"Consequently, they lead to simplistic and/or incomplete analyses that often
create misleading perceptions adversely affecting communities and their
residents."

Doug Goldenberg-Hart, acquisitions editor at CQ Press, said that the rankings
are imperfect, but that the numbers are straightforward. Cities at the top of
the list would not be there unless they ranked poorly in all six crime
categories, he said.

"The idea that people oppose it, it's kind of blaming the messenger,"
Goldenberg-Hart said. "It's not coming to terms with the idea that crime is a
persistent problem in our society."

The report "helps concerned Americans learn how their communities fare in the
fight against crime," CQ Press said in a statement. "The first step in making
our cities and states safer is to understand the true magnitude of their crime
problems. This will only be achieved through straightforward data that all of us
can use and understand."

The study excluded Chicago, Minneapolis, and other Illinois and Minnesota cities
because of incomplete data.

U.S. FIGURES ECHO GRIM TREND IN YOUTH VIOLENCE

BYLINE: FRED BAYLES, AP

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A2

LENGTH: 472 words


Behind the tallies of a record number of homicides in U.S. cities in 1993 lies
an even more disturbing trend: Young people account for a disproportionate
number of the deaths. And experts say it's likely to get worse.

In Baltimore, the 13 to 24 age group accounted for more than half the murder
arrests and 40 per cent of the victims.

In Cleveland, half the 173 homicides this year were committed by those under age
25. Five years ago, that age group accounted for less than a third of the
killings.

"We're getting kids 12, 13 years old involved in murders and that was very rare
until a few years ago," said Cleveland homicide Det. Richard Martin.

In San Jose, Calif., juveniles arrested for serious crimes rose by 39 per cent
over the past five years. It went up five per cent for adults.

The numbers are in sharp contrast to optimistic figures released this fall. The
FBI's Uniformed Crime Statistics indicated violent crime dropped five per cent
in the first half of 1993 over the same period in 1992.

Cities from Baltimore to Oakland, Calif., will close the year with record
numbers of homicides. Even in communities where the murder count has dropped,
killings involving young people are rising.

From 1986 to 1991, the homicide rate among 14 to 24 year olds rose by 62 per
cent and 124 per cent for those 14 to 17.

So while the 465 homicides recorded in Washington, D.C., this year is up only
three per cent over last year and down from the record 489 of 1991, murders
committed by those 17 and younger increased 17 per cent.

In St. Louis, police this week announced a record 267th murder, the number of
homicides has doubled in six years. Scott Decker, chairman of the Criminal
Justice Department at the University of Missouri, said the pattern of homicide
has changed.

"The decreasing age of offenders and victims is the most profound change in
homicide rates since World War II."

Worse still is what these shifting patterns portend. The increase in violence
among the young comes as the size of the group has actually shrunk. But the baby
bust is giving way to a new population surge. By 2005, the 15 to 19 age group is
projected to increase by 23 per cent.

"Indicators in the demographics support the contention homicide is only going to
increase," Decker said.

Officials point to many reasons behind the increase.

"It's a little of everything," said Kevin Robinson, a police spokesman in
Phoenix, which saw a record 176 murders, up from last year's record of 158.
"It's population, gangs and easy accessibility of weapons."

Decker talks of a "contagion" of violence among teenagers that begins with a
fight and ends with murder.

"It spreads like a disease.

"It escalates from settling a score to making a pre-emptive strike. Someone gets
shot and it takes off from there."

FBI reports increase in violent crimes in 2005

BYLINE: Kevin Johnson

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 4A

LENGTH: 504 words


WASHINGTON -- The nation's violent-crime rate increased in 2005 for the first
time in five years, the FBI said Monday in a report that reflected in part what
crime analysts say is a resurgence in gang activity, particularly in the
Midwest.

Of the four crime categories that make up the FBI's violent-crime index --
murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault -- only rape declined in the
national figures.

In some cities, the increase in violence has led to crime rates that are in line
with those posted in the years before the historically low rates that began in
the mid-1990s.

The reported jump in homicides -- nearly 5% nationwide -- was the largest annual
increase in the past 15 years. Some of the biggest increases were in Milwaukee,
Oklahoma City, Omaha, St. Louis and other Midwestern cities.

Oklahoma City police cited fighting among rival gangs as a major factor in the
jump in homicides there, from 39 in 2004 to 54 last year. As a result, police
Sgt. Paco Balderrama says, the department is beefing up its anti-gang units:
"We're working gangs every night."

Gangs from the East and West coasts "are branching out to smaller cities, where
there is still money to be made and turf to be ruled," says James Alan Fox,
criminal justice professor at Northeastern University in Boston.

In Omaha, homicides jumped from 20 in 2004 to 31 in 2005. Police Chief Thomas
Warren said the city averaged 30-32 homicides a year before a low point in 2004.
Despite the rise in homicides, the city recorded an overall decline in violent
crime in 2005, a development Warren attributes to the city's aggressive stance
against the "ongoing and persistent problem" with criminal gangs.

The FBI report also is renewing the debate over whether the U.S. government's
dropping of an ambitious police-hiring program -- along with many law
enforcement agencies' new emphasis on preventing terrorism -- have made crime
prevention more difficult.

"This should be a loud wake-up call for the country to get back to doing what
worked in the 1990s," Fox says. "When you look back at the 1990s, we were
expanding police forces and pouring more money into after-school programs. Now,
we're seeing just the reverse."

Fox was referring in part to the Bush administration's phasing out of a
Clinton-era program aimed at putting 100,000 new cops on U.S. streets. Police
chiefs nationwide have called for renewing the program to offset local cutbacks.

Despite the popularity of the Community Oriented Policing Services program among
police and crime analysts, a USA TODAY review of the program last year found
little evidence that it was a big factor in reducing crime.

Justice Department officials cautioned against reading too much into the FBI
report. "The crime rate is so low in some communities that relatively modest
increases can result in what appear to be fairly stark increases," says Richard
Hertling, deputy assistant attorney general for the Office of Legal Policy.

Polls Urge Taxes to Fund Youth Crime Prevention; More Early Childhood,
After-School Initiatives Sought by Law Enforcement Group

Sewell Chan, Washington Post Staff Writer

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B02

LENGTH: 452 words



Congress should use the budget surplus to expand Head Start and other early
childhood development initiatives and after-school programs, a group of national
and local law enforcement executives urged yesterday.

Fight Crime: Invest in Kids, a nonprofit organization of 550 law enforcement
officials and crime survivors, has written Congress asking for new funding for
Head Start, day-care programs, parenting classes, family counseling and
delinquency prevention efforts.

If Congress passes tax cuts instead of investing in children, "we'll be looking
at a crime wave the likes of which we've never seen before," Sanford A. Newman,
the organization's president, said at a news conference outside the District's
Alice Deal Junior High School.

The group released the results of two polls conducted this summer that found
that 74 percent of the respondents would be willing to pay more taxes or forgo a
tax cut in order to provide greater access to after-school and early childhood
development programs to combat youth violence. Each survey polled about 1,000
people.

Two-thirds of those polled said initiatives that deter youth violence are a
greater national priority than cutting taxes; 81 percent said violence
prevention programs are as important as efforts to punish or incarcerate young
offenders.

Arlington Police Chief Edward A. Flynn and D.C. Executive Assistant Police Chief
Terrance W. Gainer endorsed the findings of both polls.

"We invest far too little in our kids," said Gainer, who was director of the
Illinois State Police before coming to the District last year. He said his
oldest son, an FBI agent, and his second-oldest son, a Cook County, Ill.,
prosecutor, are "now locking up the grandchildren" of people Gainer arrested as
a rookie officer in Chicago.

"We need to do something about making sure our kids don't have run-ins with law
enforcement," Gainer added, noting that preventive rather than reactive efforts
are a key element in community policing. "Prevention is the only solution," he
said.

The group's recommendations also have been endorsed by the Major Cities Chiefs
and the Police Executive Research Forum, Newman said.

In the District, police have been working with school officials and security
guards to document disputes among children, according to Assistant Chief Brian
K. Jordan, who said, "Many of the incidents either carry over from school to the
streets or from streets to the school."

Jordan said school safety coordinators met last week with conflict resolution
experts and members of the police emergency response team to discuss how to
prevent school violence and keep school buildings closed to people who don't
belong there.

Number of hate crimes in El Paso unchanged

BYLINE: By Daniel Borunda / El Paso Times

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 361 words


The number of hate crimes in El Paso remained unchanged last year even as hate
crimes nationally dropped to their lowest level in a decade, an FBI report
released Monday said.

Last year in El Paso, there were eight hate crimes reported, which equals the
number of incidents in 2004, according to the Hate Crime Statistics 2005 report.

"I don't think there is a lot of polarization here (in El Paso). All the ethnic
groups get along well," said Elizabeth Branham, an organizer of last weekend's
Fiesta of the Nations multicultural event.

The event featured 17 dance and musical groups, and included Middle Eastern,
German, Puerto Rican and Native American cultures. Branham said El Paso's border
location made it more accepting of different cultures.

The FBI report broke down the crimes by bias motivation -- race, religion,
sexual orientation, ethnicity and disability. The breakdown for El Paso was:

     ·    Race: 2.Sexual orientation: 1.Ethnicity: 5.


An El Paso police description of each of the crimes was not available Monday.

The total number of hate crimes in El Paso in 2005 was similar to past years.
There were 10 cases in 2003; 11 in 2002; 7 in 2001; and 9 in 2000, according to
FBI and Texas Department of Public Safety figures.

Nationally, there were 7,163 hate crime incidents, marking the lowest total in
more than a decade, the FBI stated on its Web site. The majority of hate crimes,
or 81 percent, were damage or vandalism of property.

Special Agent Andrea Simmons, an FBI spokeswoman in El Paso, said the document
collected information from local and state agencies. Las Cruces was not listed
in the report.

A Web site for the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups, showed
no known active hate groups in El Paso or all of New Mexico. There were 43
active hate groups in other parts of Texas.

FEAR OF CRIME HOBBLES CITIES AND CASTS SHADOW ON SUBURBS

BYLINE: By ALFONSO A. NARVAEZ

SECTION: Section 11; New Jersey; Page 1, Column 1; New Jersey Weekly Desk

LENGTH: 769 words


NEWARK IN THIS city, as in many other communities across the state, residents
scurry home with approaching nightfall, anxiously peering over their shoulders
as they walk, crossing the street if a stranger approaches and barring the door
once they are safely inside.

For many, home provides the only sanctuary against marauders, but it also
becomes a virtual prison, one from which many people are afraid to venture forth
until daylight brings life to the streets.

In an effort to study the fear of crime, which in many instances is far out of
proportion to crime statistics, and to develop ways of combating it, Federal
officials last week announced a $1.8 million program to test theories of crime
fighting.

For the next six months, researchers from the Police Foundation, a
Washington-based, nonprofit organization dedicated to developing and improving
law-enforcement techniques, will fan out through Newark neighborhoods to ask
residents, shopkeepers and local police officers for their ideas on fighting
crime.

They will examine thoroughly the causes of fear of crime and develop possible
strategies for reducing it on the streets. Once strategies have been developed,
they will be field-tested for 12 months to determine which ones work to reduce
fear.

Newark was chosen, along with Houston, Tex., because its Police Department
played an important role in a 1978 Police Foundation experiment that studied the
effects of police foot patrols.

Patrick V. Murphy, president of the Police Foundation and a former New York City
Police Commissioner, wrote in a report on the 1978 study that ''although foot
patrol does not appreciably reduce or prevent crime, it does measurably and
significantly affect citizens' feeling of safety and mobility in their
neighborhoods.''

''Consistently,'' the report said, ''residents in beats where foot patrol was
added see the severity of crime problems diminishing in the neighborhoods.
Street disorders, serious crime, drug usage, vandalism, victimization of the
elderly and auto theft all are perceived to be less of a problem.''

In announcing the 18-month program at a City Hall press conference last week,
Attorney General William French Smith said: ''In too many of our nation's
communities, the fear of crime confines law-abiding, hard-working citizens
behind the locked doors of their homes when they should be free to walk the
streets and enjoy the neighborhoods where they live.''

The press conference was attended by Governor Kean and Mayor Kenneth A. Gibson.
Lawrence W. Stewart, director of research for the Police Foundation, put it this
way: ''As every police officer knows, the fear of crime contributes greatly to a
host of urban ills: the deterioration of neighborhoods, the drying up of
commercial activities and a fortress mentality among citizens that leads to
abandonment of city streets by the lawabiding,''

He said that the experiments would test the premise that a neighborhood whose
character was within the control of the people who lived there was generally a
safer neighborhood.

''The overall effort is based on the belief that a community's fear of crime may
itself be a major factor in the health and future of the city,'' Mr. Stewart
said. ''The debilitating apprehension about crime weakens the fabric of an urban
neighborhood's social and economic life.''

He added that the results of the study would give Police Departments and
communities across the country ''solid guidance about what works to make
citizens feel safer and be safer in their neighborhoods.''

The study and development of strategies will be financed by a $1,830,534 grant
to the Police Foundation by the National Institute of Justice of the Department
of Justice.

The program will test whether police and community efforts can be developed to
reduce disorderly behavior and thus reverse an atmosphere that suggests that
nobody cares, and whether this would have a direct effect on reducing fear of
crime and the perception of a neighborhood as unsafe.

The study will also try to determine whether a reduction in the fear of crime
has a direct effect on reducing serious crime itself, on the premise that a
neighborhood that is not fearful of crime may attract less crime. Another goal
of the study is to determine whether a reduction in fear will increase a
neighborhood's commercial activity.

Officials said that the study would attempt to maintain moreorderly conditions
in the neighborhoods at night, improve the physical appearance of the areas
through cleaner streets and study traffic flow to see whether changes could keep
strangers out of the area.

Camden's crime rate again leads U.S.

BYLINE: By Rita Giordano; Inquirer Staff Writer

SECTION: SOUTH JERSEY; P-com News Local; Pg. B01

LENGTH: 426 words



Camden has the highest crime rate in the country once again, according to an
annual study released yesterday by CQ Press.

In a ranking of 393 cities, Camden had more than five times the national average
of violent crimes in 2008. Just behind Camden - with 2,332.6 violent crimes per
100,000 population - were St. Louis; Oakland, Calif.; and Detroit and Flint,
Mich.

Philadelphia had the 21st-highest crime rate. Colonie, N.Y., a suburb of Albany,
had the lowest rate, with only 54 incidences of violent crime all year.

The last time Camden was named most violent was in 2004 and 2005. Last year, the
survey ranked Camden's crime level second-highest in the nation. For the two
years before that, it was fifth-highest.

Camden County Prosecutor Warren Faulk dismissed the most recent rankings, based
on FBI data, as "old news."

"Those statistics are for 2008, and we've made great strides in 2009," Faulk
said.

Local, state and federal law-enforcement agencies last year embarked on a
six-month operation to dismantle some of Camden's most dangerous drug
organizations. State Attorney General Anne Milgram has vowed that the fight will
continue.

Arrests are up 25 percent since November 2008, according to the Camden Police
Department.

While overall violent crime rose 5 percent during that period, crime in many
major categories declined, according to police figures. Homicides fell 39
percent, shootings 17 percent, and rapes 13 percent. Robbery, burglary, larceny,
and motor vehicle theft also declined. Aggravated assault rose 19 percent.

"While there is much work to be done, the reality is that Camden is a much safer
city today, both statistically and through the eyes of our residents," Police
Inspector Michael Lynch wrote in an e-mail.

The CQ Press rankings are calculated using data from six categories: murder,
rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, and motor vehicle theft. The cities
ranked must have a population of at least 75,000.

The study has been criticized as simplistic by some law enforcement experts. The
rankings compare incidences of crime by population, but do not figure in other
factors.

City Councilman Gilbert "Whip" Wilson, a former city police officer, said basic
socioeconomic issues, such as job creation, must be tackled if Camden is to
solve its crime problem.

"Until those things are addressed, you're still going to have a skyrocketing
crime rate in urban places like Camden City," he said.

Drop in crime is starting to sink in with the public

BYLINE: Patrick O'Driscoll

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 2A

LENGTH: 351 words


The dramatic drop in major crime for most of this decade is finally
registering with wary Americans, a new USA TODAY/CNN/Gallup Poll
finds.

Fifty-two percent of those questioned still believe crime nationally
is higher than last year. But that is far less than the 89% who
thought so in 1992, the year violent and serious crime began a
steady decline.


Sunday, the FBI will release final 1997 statistics for eight categories
of major crime: murder, rape, robbery, assault, burglary, larceny,
car theft and arson. The numbers are expected to show a sixth
straight year of decline.

Will Americans notice? The new poll of 1,013 adults suggests they
have begun to. For the first time in 10 such polls conducted since
1972, more people say crime is going down in their own neighborhoods
than say it is rising.

USA TODAY spent months interviewing criminologists, researchers,
anti-crime activists and dozens of everyday citizens to find out
if Americans are changing their behavior as crime drops.

Many still believe the nation is in the grip of the crime wave
of the 1980s and early 1990s. Anti-crime political campaigns,
marketing by security firms and saturation coverage of crime and
violence as news and entertainment skew people's perceptions of
crime.

But gradually Americans are changing.

They're going downtown for dinner in areas they once avoided as
unsafe. They're moving back to neighborhoods they fled before
police and community action cleaned things up. More parents are
sending their children to urban colleges because they're less
afraid of the inner city.

But if Americans feel measurably safer, they are also continuing
to keep their guard up. Millions more people are installing home
and car alarms, carrying weapons for self-protection and retreating
to gated communities in the suburbs.

"After a long lag time, both people and systems have changed
to adjust to a high-crime world," University of Maryland criminologist
Lawrence Sherman says. "We've regained that wariness, and we're
not going to give it up anytime soon."

We Can Cut Crime

Stephen D. Harlan

SECTION: OP-ED; Pg. C07

LENGTH: 1247 words


Residents of some of the nation's largest cities are discovering that crime
rates overall and homicide rates in particular aren't always destined to rise.
Crime can fall markedly -- sometimes dramatically. The police can devise and
deploy inventive approaches that successfully combat crime. They can enforce the
law and be seen to do so in a way that contributes to the public's sense of well
being. They can change from ducking responsibility for crime control to being
accountable for it.

This is a message of hope for crime-beleaguered citizens of the District if the
Metropolitan Police Department can become as resourceful and determined as some
of its counterparts. I believe it can.

Last December we formed a police memorandum of understanding (MOU) partnership
consisting of the police chief, the U.S. attorney, the chief judge of the
Superior Court, the corporation counsel, the city council, the mayor, and the
D.C. contol board. The partnership was formed to reduce crime, fear of crime and
general disorder.

Some of my colleagues and I on the MOU partnership visited Chicago, New York and
Boston police departments and held meetings with police chiefs, street officers,
U.S. attorneys and many other criminal justice officials. The purpose was to
identify crime-control programs that work and that our department can adopt. We
are also getting plenty of good ideas from District community groups and
citizens that we meet with continuously.

We have learned that police departments can change and succeed. For example,
earlier in this decade, the New York City Police Department was no one's model
for success. In a description that may sound familiar to Washingtonians, the
department had corruption scandals and "a mile-high hierarchy in which the
underling strove above all to protect his superiors from embarrassment," author
James Lardner wrote in the New York Times. "That was then. Now this same
department is everybody's favorite exemplar of purposeful efficiency."

Why the change? Major crime is down 39 percent, and homicide is down 49 percent
since 1993. The city has a new, hopeful attitude about itself and its
expectation for public safety. At least part of the major drop in crime is being
attributed to police department initiatives.

One of these targets minor lawbreakers -- people drinking alcohol on the street,
urinating in public, hustling motorists for change and committing other
infractions that contribute to a sense that the law-abiding have lost control of
the streets. Confronting these offenders yields several results. The police reap
valuable information about drug dealing, gun trafficking and other illegal
activities. The criminally inclined are less likely to carry weapons. A sense
that public places are safer develops.

Another police initiative, CompStat (short for computer comparison statistics),
enforces managerial accountability for crime control. Once, New York's 76
precinct commanders were insulated from headquarters and the rigors of
accountability for crime by layers of bureaucracy and, perhaps, by indifference.
Now top department brass use weekly computer-generated precinct crime statistics
to grill commanders about how they are using the increased discretion they've
been given to control crime. Unprepared and unproductive commanders lose their
jobs.

In Boston, no juvenile under 17 has been slain by gunfire since July 1995.
Homicide for youth under 24 is down by more than two-thirds -- from 40 to 12 --
for the past year. Boston's achievement is an instance where the police
department and its allies in other city agencies and state and federal law
enforcement are able to work together successfully. A joint effort called
Ceasefire focuses on controlling gangs and guns. The experience of the police
department's gang unit is that youth homicide is a gang problem involving repeat
offenders.

One part of Boston's effort began with a proposal by Robert Fratalia, a police
detective, and Bill Stewart, a youth probation officer. They proposed to let
unarmed probation officers ride with police officers in patrol cars. Unlike the
police, probation officers do not need probable cause to stop young people on
probation or to enter their homes. They can arrest youths seen violating terms
of probation. They recognize gang members who likely are on probation or parole.
They can help see to it that probations are revoked or extended for young people
who stray into gang violence.

In Chicago the police department has established an easy-to-use computerized
mapping system to help officers analyze and solve neighborhood crime problems.
Beat officers in the city's 25 police districts generate maps of timely,
accurate crime data for their beats and sectors, and quickly target and go after
hot spots of criminal activity. The system allows the police to share crime
information with communities working with the police as part of the department's
community policing program.

Abandoned vehicles and buildings, trash littering the streets, graffiti and
other signs of decay and disorder in public places are thought to contribute to
crime and the public's fear of crime. As another part of Chicago's community
policing program, the police can call on appropriate city agencies to remedy
these problems -- towing away derelict cars, for example, or removing graffiti
-- and hold those agencies accountable for following through. They route their
requests through the Mayor's Office of Inquiry and Information, which issues
weekly status reports on how requests have been handled. In four years, 90,000
police requests have been fulfilled.

Not all successful anticrime programs consist of one or two clearly defined
initiatives. Some are a coordinated bundle of efforts. Call up the Dallas Police
Department's Web site on the Internet and you'll find eight pages describing
individual pieces that make up the agency's community policing program -- pieces
such as mobile storefronts, partnerships with minorities and business people,
Crime Watch programs for children, apartments and businesses, measures to combat
graffiti, programs to protect older citizens from rip-off artists, and a
late-night basketball program for young people that is funded by a local bank.

Overall, crime has dropped almost 40 percent in Dallas during the past eight
years. Homicide was down 21 percent last year. Chief Bennie Click attributes
much of the decrease in crime to the cumulative effect of the incremental
efforts that constitute community policing in Dallas.

The lesson for the District from these other cities is that the police can
attack crime and that crime rates, including homicide rates, can fall, even
plummet.

In our police department, I believe we have commanders like those in New York
who will step up and accept accountability for crime control. I believe we have
officers like Boston's Detective Fratalia whose crime-fighting ingenuity we must
unleash. I believe we can replicate successful programs such as those in Chicago
and Dallas and even devise our own ground-breaking programs to control crime.
All this is possible if we are able to restructure the Metropolitan Police
Department into an organizationally sound, managerially capable, well-trained
and expertly led agency that responds effectively to the needs of all citizens
and makes crime control its No. 1 goal. I am convinced we can do it.

The writer is vice chairman of the D.C. control board.

Concealed Handguns and Crime

SECTION: OP-ED; Pg. A20; LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

LENGTH: 403 words


Richard Morin's "Unconventional Wisdom" column [Outlook, March 23] contained
several serious mistakes about my recent study of gun-control laws. I found that
allowing law-abiding citizens to carry concealed handguns deters criminals and
reduces violent crime, with murder rates falling by at least 8 percent.

Mr. Morin's column cited research by Dan Black and Dan Nagin from Carnegie
Mellon University claiming that they found "the annual murder rate did go down
in six of the 10 states -- but it went up in the other four, including a 100
percent increase in West Virginia." Similar claims are made for rape and robbery
rates.

But this is an apples-and-oranges error. Mr. Black and Mr. Nagin did not use
evidence based on what happened to these states' crime rates but on the crime
rates for counties with more than 100,000 people. For example, in West Virginia
this means examining only one county -- Kanawha. The other 54 counties in West
Virginia, with 89 percent of the state's population, were excluded from their
estimates. In fact, the Black-Nagin analysis eliminated 85 percent of all U.S.
counties.

When I made estimates using all counties, I certainly did not obtain "wildly"
different estimates across states, as Mr. Black is quoted as saying. Violent
crime rates fell in nine of the 10 new states that enacted right-to-carry laws
between 1977 and 1992. The only variations among those states can be explained
by differences in the rate that concealed-handgun permits were issued. States
that issued more permits experienced greater reductions in crime.

Nor were my projections based on "county-level crime data collected by the FBI
in 10 states that passed so-called [right-to-carry] laws between 1977 and 1992."
I did use FBI data, but for all 3,054 counties in all 50 states and the District
of Columbia for these 16 years, and 18 states had passed these laws by 1992.

I have made these data available to academics at any university who have
requested them. To date, that amounts to 24 universities, including: University
of Pennsylvania, Emory University, University of Texas and Vanderbilt
University. No one has had any trouble replicating the study's results, and I
believe that discussions with these scholars would have supported our findings.

Webb back from D.C., crime-bill signing

LENGTH: 355 words


Mayor Wellington Webb arrived in Denver yesterday from his meeting with Attorney
General Janet Reno in Washington, D.C., confident that more police officers will
hit the streets of Denver shortly after congressional allocations begin next
fall.

Webb, who was in Washington for the signing of the $ 30.2 billion crime bill
Tuesday, met with Reno along with mayors from Fort Wayne, Ind., Louisville, Ky.,
and Chicago. Webb said Denver should see the results of the crime bill shortly
after the first wave of funding, expected Oct. 1, 1995.

"We would like to see as many police officers on the streets as soon as
possible," Webb said.

The first order of business of the crime bill is to add 100,000 police officers
to the nation's streets next year, at a cost of $ 1.3 billion. It is unknown how
many additional officers Denver will hire.

"Another issue I raised with her was that we did not want to see cities like
Denver penalized because our crime rate is going down," Webb said.

"That should be only one factor of the analysis in determining what cities are
allocated dollars."

Webb said he felt that Reno was responsive to his concerns and willing to work
with the mayors. He expects to cover more ground with Reno on the crime-bill
allocations next week when he attends the U.S. Conference of Mayors in
Knoxville, Tenn.

Denver's share of the money is still uncertain. The first step was the signing
of the crime bill; now the allocation process begins.

Webb said Denver is applying for funds under all sections of the bill.

In addition to hiring more police officers, Webb said he stressed to Reno
Denver's need to pay officers overtime and to update equipment.

The bill also allows money for crime-prevention programs, grants to combat
violence against women, continued judicial supervision of drug offenders and the
construction of prisons. The death penalty is also being extended under the
crime bill to 60 federal crimes, including fatal drive-by shootings.

"A main concern that I shared with her was that we don't want the process to be
bogged down in red tape and too much bureaucracy," Webb said.

Crime rate continues to fall in U.S.: 'This is the calm before the crime storm,'
scholar warns

BYLINE: LORI MONTGOMERY; KNIGHT-RIDDER NEWSPAPERS

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. B1 / BREAK

LENGTH: 809 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON


Serious crime fell in the United States for the fourth year in a row in 1995,
with murder dropping a remarkable 8 per cent - the third-sharpest one-year
decline in more than 30 years.

Largest cities led the way, recording steep reductions in all categories of
violent crime, according to an FBI report made public yesterday. Experts credit
more effective police tactics and the maturation of once-violent drug markets
with contributing to the good news.

But there's bad news, too, scholars warn: while over-all crime is going down,
crime among teens - particularly violent crime - has been rising sharply. With
the number of teens due to increase over the next decade, experts say, the
United States soon might see an explosion of juvenile violence to rival the
drug-driven carnage of the late 1980s.

"This is the calm before the crime storm," said James Alan Fox, dean of the
College of Criminal Justice at Northeastern University in Boston. "It's great
that crime is down now, but if we start celebrating our successes, we may be
blindsided by a bloodbath."

The new report, the FBI's annual Uniform Crime Report, reflects the number of
incidents reported to police agencies in eight major crime categories. Its
results are preliminary and do not allow an analysis of trends among juveniles
in 1995.

Nationally, the report shows serious crime fell 2 per cent last year, with
property crimes down 1 per cent and violent crimes down 4 per cent.

Crime fell in every category and in every region of the country, dropping most
sharply - 4 per cent - in the Northeast. The Midwest had a 2-per-cent decline;
the South and West recorded 1-per-cent reductions.

Murder declined most dramatically, falling 8 per cent to about 21,400 murders
for 1995, down from a peak of about 24,700 murders in 1991, according to FBI
statistics.

Some experts were reluctant to read too much into the fact that the country was
substantially less lethal last year.

Howard Snyder, director of the National Centre for Juvenile Justice in
Pittsburgh, noted that the number of murders in the United States has hovered
around 20,000 since about 1975.

"Over the last 20 years, nothing has really happened. There's never been any
really big change," said Snyder, who analyzes juvenile crime for the U.S.
Justice Department. "Things go up and then they tend to come back down, like a
swing."

Other experts agreed that the drop probably represents a simple leveling off of
murder rates in major cities, where murder skyrocketed during rapid expansion of
crack cocaine in the late 1980s.

Indeed, just five big cities - New York, Houston, Chicago, San Antonio, New
Orleans and Detroit - accounted for nearly 40 per cent of the total reduction in
murders last year.

"You know who finds it easiest to lose a lot of weight? Really obese people,"
said Fox of Northeastern University. "The statistics in the cities are returning
to a more normal level."

Alfred Blumstein, a criminologist at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh
and director of the newly created National Consortium on Violence Research,
gives credit to police - and drug dealers - for helping to stop the killing.

Dealers, Blumstein said, have largely settled their turf battles and are now
refraining from using violence as a means to resolve conflicts.

"Just as we saw with the Mafia, there's a mutual interest after this initial
period of violence whereby the still-active drug dealers would just as soon tone
it down, partly for their own safety and partly because it diminishes community
reaction to them," Blumstein said.

Meanwhile, he said, police in the largest cities have been experimenting with
more effective methods for getting guns off the streets.

In New York City, for example, former police commissioner William Bratton has
received lavish praise for his approach to crime prevention. Bratton dispatched
special squads to roam high-violence areas with orders to stop and frisk
residents for even minor infractions.

The goal: to find and confiscate illegal guns. The result: 400 fewer murders in
New York City last year - 21 per cent of the total national decline.

Despite declining numbers of murders, the usual suspects made the list of the
top five most murderous U.S. cities. New Orleans retained the title of murder
capital for the third straight year, even though its homicide rate declined.
Rounding out the top five in number of murders in proportion to population:
Washington, D.C., Richmond, Va., St. Louis and Detroit.

Looking at all categories of crime, four of the five safest cities in 1995 were
in California: Thousand Oaks, Simi Valley, Sunnyvale and Santa Clarita. Livonia,
Mich., came in fifth.

- As violent crime among teens increases, experts fear an explosion of juvenile
violence to rival the drug-driven carnage of the late '80s.

Murders Across Nation Rise by 3 Percent, but Overall Violent Crime Is Down

BYLINE: AP

SECTION: Section A;  Page 13;  Column 2;  National Desk

LENGTH: 609 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 1


The number of murders rose 3 percent last year but violent crimes over all edged
lower, the Federal Bureau of Investigation reported today.

Preliminary findings of the bureau's Uniform Crime Reports, which compile
information on crimes reported to law-enforcement agencies nationwide, showed
that violent incidents declined 1 percent overall in 1993. That would mean about
1.91 million violent crimes occurred, or roughly the same number as in 1991.
There were 1.93 million violent crimes reported in 1992.

While the report included only percentage increases or decreases, the numbers of
crimes could be calculated from the figures provided in the 1992 revised report.

The 3 percent increase in murders in 1993 would reflect a total of about 24,500
killings. About 23,760 people were killed in 1992, while a record 24,703 were
slain the year before.

At the same time, the number of reported forcible rapes dropped by 4 percent, to
an estimated 104,600; robberies declined by 2 percent, to about 659,000, and
aggravated assaults remained level, at about 1.1 million, the crime reports
said.

Property crimes like burglary and vehicle theft, meanwhile, dropped by 3
percent, the F.B.I. said, to an estimated 12.1 million. Because property crimes
account for about 87 percent of all reported crimes, that caused the number of
crimes reported to the authorities to fall by 3 percent as well, to an estimated
14 million.

The report also said that burglaries declined by 6 percent, to about 2.8 million
and that vehicle thefts were down by 4 percent, to 1.5 million.

But crime experts said Americans should not necessarily be cheered by the
statistics. "This may be the last good report that we see in a long time," said
Jack Levin, professor of sociology and criminology at Northeastern University in
Boston. "This is the lull before the crime storm that we're going to have in
this country the next decade."

The reason, he said, is that homicides by juveniles as young as 14 and 15 are on
the rise. These juveniles are in the forefront of a wave of children whose
parents were members of the postwar baby boom, and the children have not yet
reached the 18- to 24-year-old age group that historically commits the
overwhelming majority of murders, he said.

"What are they going to do for an encore?" Professor Levin asked.

Alfred Blumstein, a professor at the Heinz School of Public Policy at Carnegie
Mellon University in Pittsburgh, attributes many of the killings to the wide
availability of guns, especially those wielded by teen-agers "who aren't very
good at avoiding disputes."

Disagreements that once led to fistfights "much too often now involve shooting
because they've got the guns," Professor Blumstein said.

The F.B.I. said violent crimes in cities of more than one million dropped by 4
percent, including 4 percent declines in murders and forcible rapes, a 5 percent
drop in robberies and a 3 percent decline in aggravated assaults. Similarly,
last month the New York City Police Department reported that violent crime had
declined 4 percent in 1993.

In rural areas, violent crimes rose by 4 percent. While murders in those areas
declined by 3 percent and robberies decreased by 2 percent, forcible rapes rose
by 2 percent and aggravated assaults increased by 5 percent. Aggravated assaults
account for the largest number of violent crimes.

Regionally, violent crimes declined 2 percent in the Northeast and 1 percent in
the Midwest and West and remained level in the South. Overall crimes, including
property crimes, declined 5 percent in the Northeast, 3 percent in the Midwest,
and 2 percent in the South and West.

FALL IN CRIME BYPASSES PHILA.< DESPITE A 0.9% STATEWIDE IMPROVEMENT, VIOLENT
CRIMES< INCREASED 6.4% IN PHILADELPHIA AND ITS SUBURBS.

BYLINE: Robert Zausner, INQUIRER STAFF WRITER

SECTION: CITY & REGION; Pg. B02

LENGTH: 478 words

DATELINE: HARRISBURG


The state police trumpeted a drop in crime for 1995 in a report yesterday but
there was little comfort for citizens of Philadelphia or its suburbs, where
violent offenses rose 6.4 percent and there were 496 murders.

Only one county in the metropolitan area, Bucks County, had a drop in violent
crime, a category that includes murder, robbery, rape, aggravated assault,
burglary, larceny and car theft.

The highest crime rate in the state was recorded in the Philadelphia region,
which had a rate more than triple that of the lowest crime-rate region of
Johnstown.

The Ridge administration ballyhooed the results of the Uniform Crime Report in a
four-page news release touting a 0.9 percent decline in overall crime and
crediting Gov. Ridge for being "at the forefront of Pennsylvania's renewed
efforts against crime."

The release's next-to-last paragraph, however, noted that crime data were not
submitted by the city of Scranton, an omission that accounts for most - 0.75
percentage points of the 0.9 percent - of the drop in overall crime, which also
includes offenses such as forgery, fraud, vandalism and assault.

By comparison, overall crime had risen in 1994 by less than 1 percent, and had
dropped in 1993 by about 2.4 percent.

The number of violent crimes statewide did show a more sizable decline - 1.6
percent as listed in the report, or 1.1 percent drop if estimates for Scranton
are included; Juvenile crime also fell by slightly more than 2 percent.

But while the rate of violent crime fell statewide, it rose in the five-county
Philadelphia region. Murders were up 8 percent to 496.

Philadelphia reported 108,710 violent crimes, up about 8,000. That was a rate of
nearly 7,000 violent crimes per 100,000 residents, or about 1,000 per 100,000
more than the state's second-largest city, Pittsburgh.

As in previous years, the report showed that crime strikes more than twice as
often in the city as in the suburbs.

The number of violent crimes per 100,000 population in Delaware County was
3,641, up 7 percent. The City of Chester accounted for much of that, with a
violent crime rate of 13,998 per 100,000, a 15 percent increase.

The rate was 3,263 per 100,000 in Montgomery County, up 11 percent; 2,390 per
100,000 in Chester County, up 8 percent; and 2,613 per 100,000 in Bucks County,
down 7 percent.

The number of murders in Philadelphia rose from 404 in 1994 to 432 last year,
according to the report. That total accounted for more than half the murders
committed in the state last year - 736, up 33.

Murders also were on the rise in Delaware County, from 29 to 35, and Chester
County, from four to 10. The number declined in Bucks, 12 to nine, and
Montgomery, 12 to 10.

State Police Commissioner Paul J. Evanko expressed concern over the "ominous
growth" in drug abuse violations, which rose 5.5 percent to 34,567.

Study: Las Vegas police solve few violent crimes

BYLINE: Paul Leavitt

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 4A

LENGTH: 1005 words


Las Vegas solves a smaller percentage of its violent crimes than any other large
city, an Associated Press study of 1994 FBI crime data found. Las Vegas Metro
police reported 9,421 violent crimes, but only 1,946 resulted in an arrest or
prosecution. That's a clearance rate of 20.7%.

Sheriff Jerry Keller says the gambling mecca is unique - a 24-hour town with 27
million tourists. "Any time you have money, you have the two things that drive
crime: ego and greed," Keller said. "Greed for wanting the money that someone
else has, and ego to think they can continue getting away with it."

Other cities of at least 250,000 people with low clearance rates: Detroit,
21.4%; Buffalo, 21.9%; San Francisco, 24.5%; Miami, 25.7%; Santa Ana, Calif.,
26.4%; Sacramento, 27.5%; Newark, 28.9%; Baltimore, 29.3%; and Louisville at
30.0%.

RIGHT TO DIE: Lawyers can't ask potential jurors in Jack Kevorkian's assisted
suicide trial about their religious beliefs or their views on a law that bans
the practice, the trial judge in Pontiac, Mich., ruled. Judge Jessica Cooper had
agreed to a defense motion to ask such questions but threw out the juror
questionnaires pending an appeals court decision on the matter. That delayed
jury selection until at least today. Kevorkian, 67, a retired pathologist, is
accused of aiding two 1993 suicides of people who inhaled carbon monoxide.
Kevorkian has been present at 27 deaths since 1990.

MODEL BOSS: U.S. Labor Secretary Robert Reich praised Malden Mills owner Aaron
Feuerstein in Methuen, Mass., for paying his 3,000 employees after a fire at the
family-owned fabric mill Dec. 11 destroyed three of nine buildings. About 70%
are back at work and the others will get full salaries and benefits until the
end of the year. Feuerstein, 70, said standing by his workers would be tougher
in a public company where he would have to answer to stockholders.

CITADEL DROPOUTS: Shannon Faulkner, the first female cadet at The Citadel in
Charleston, S.C., wasn't the only one to leave the corps this year. Of the 591
freshmen at the state-run school, 97 didn't return for the second semester. Half
who quit cited the military environment, academics or stress. Faulkner joined in
August but left after less than a week, citing stress from her fight to get in
and isolation as the only female cadet. No other female has been admitted,
pending the outcome of a Supreme Court case.

TRASHY TOUR: New York has a new tourist attraction for people who like to trash
the city. The Fresh Kills landfill, the world's biggest garbage heap, is being
touted in a $ 50,000 project to improve its image. Sanitation workers, retrained
as tour guides, have a 30-page script and will be handing out color maps of the
Staten Island dump. By summer, says deputy landfill director William Cloke,
"we'll get a tour here almost every day." "Kills" is Dutch for stream or creek,
reflecting New York's Dutch heritage.

SIMPSON CASE: O.J. Simpson repeatedly beat Nicole Brown Simpson while she was
pregnant, and she once said, "Kicking was O.J.'s favorite," Faye Resnick said
during a deposition in a civil lawsuit against the former football star.
Resnick, 37, ended three days of questioning by lawyers in the wrongful-death
suit with reports of more Simpson beatings of Nicole, including slamming her
with wine bottles. Simpson has denied physically abusing Nicole, his ex-wife who
was stabbed to death in June 1994. Simpson was acquitted of murder in October.
His lawyers are not commenting on reports they might quit because of concerns
Simpson can't pay his legal bills.

ALSO MONDAY . . .

-- SCHOOL BOMB PLOT: Three boys, all 13, who were charged with conspiring to
blow up their Minoa, N.Y., junior high with a homemade fertilizer bomb, were
ordered to stay home for the year and undergo counseling. The boys, who police
say got the bomb recipe from the Internet, face felony conspiracy charges.

-- JORDAN TRIAL: The trial of Daniel Green, charged with murder in the death of
basketball star Michael Jordan's father, James, was delayed 30 minutes because
Green had to change out of bloody clothes after fighting with another prisoner
in a holding cell at the Lumberton, N.C., courthouse. Neither was seriously
hurt, authorities said.

-- FLOOD CLEANUP: Thousands of people are still out of their homes as the
Northwest's swollen waterways slowly receded. Wherever the rivers and streams
had strayed, globs of brown sludge remained. The death toll stood at seven: four
in Oregon, two in Montana and one in Washington. Damage is expected to top $ 620
million.

-- ELISA'S LAW: New York Gov. George Pataki signed into law a bill to protect
children by opening some reports of child abuse. "Elisa's Law" is named for
Elisa Izquierdo, whose mother is charged with her beating death last year. Elisa
would have been 7 Sunday. Child-welfare officials had numerous warnings of her
abuse.

Sting nets 2 arrests, rare 1933 coin

Secret Service agents in a sting operation seized one of the rarest U.S. coins -
an unissued 1933 Augustus Saint-Gaudens double eagle $ 20 gold piece - and
arrested two dealers on charges of conspiring to sell it for $ 1.5 million.

The Philadelphia mint made 445,500 of the coins but before they were issued,
President Franklin Roosevelt recalled all U.S. gold coins. Two were given to the
Smithsonian Institution. The rest were supposed to be melted to bullion, but a
few were stolen.

The Secret Service, which has recovered eight since 1944, set up a sting in
December when it learned a dealer was trying to find a buyer for one. Agents in
New York last Thursday arrested Japser "Jay" Parrino, 49, of Kansas City, Mo.,
and Stephen Fenton, 43, of London. Charge: conspiracy to sell U.S. government
property. They face up to five years in prison if convicted.

But some say having the coins is legal because Congress repealed the recall in
1944. "There's now no law," says David Ganz of the American

BESIEGED BY CRIME / 'One cannot feel safe anyplace'

From quiet farm towns to pricey suburban cul-de-sacs to inner-city war zones,
fear is mobilizing people in an angry backlash against crime.

From the Oval Office to Congress to statehouses and city halls, politicians are
struggling to respond.

A new USA TODAY/CNN/ Gallup poll shows fear of crime is the nation's top concern
at 37%, up dramatically from 16% only five months ago.

President Clinton asked aides to rewrite tonight's State of the Union speech to
add anti-crime talk, including a call for life sentences for those convicted of
three violent crimes.

Liberal New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, conservative California Gov. Pete Wilson and
a dozen others are demanding more cops, more prisons, harsher sentences. At
least 30 state legislatures will debate crime bills this year. Congressional
leaders told Clinton Monday they hope to have a crime bill on his desk soon.

"People are screaming for help," says Police Chief Steven Bishop of Kansas City,
Mo., which logged a record 153 homicides last year. "They want to see police
officers in their neighborhood, they want to touch them and call them by their
first name."

The rage and frustration boiling over are fueled by an unsettling sense that
there's no place to hide. Says Greensboro, N.C., Police Chief Sylvester
Daughtry: "One cannot feel safe anyplace anymore."

That realization hit Pitt County, N.C., Sheriff Billy Vandiford this weekend.
Wendy Renee Fields, a 9-year-old from Conetoe, was horseback riding with her mom
and aunt Sunday when shots were fired from a passing car. Wendy was struck in
the chest and died. "It's senseless for a young girl to die from such a random
act of violence. I'm angry this happened in rural Pitt County," says Vandiford.
The murder "is sickening, period."

Concern about crime is rising even as the number of crimes reported to police is
dropping: The FBI says crime dropped 5% in the first six months of 1993. Even
violent crime, which sparks the most fear, fell 3% during that period.

Still, the level of crime is far higher than a decade ago: The 1992 violent
crime rate was 758 per 100,000 population, nearly one-third higher than 1982's
562.

Those numbers demonstrate that fear of crime is not the product of media hype of
recent high-profile incidents, says Daughtry, president of the International
Association of Chiefs of Police. "The reality squares with the perception."

Brutal violence by young people, the scourge of gun violence and crime's
intrusion into neighborhoods where doors were not long ago left unlocked are
fueling outrage:

Between 1983 and 1992, the number of juveniles arrested on homicide charges
soared 142%.

While adults commit most crime, youngsters are seen as potentially more
dangerous. A USA TODAY/CNN/Gallup Poll in October asked what types of people
were seen as would-be criminals. The highest score - 58% - went to male teens.

Many violent juveniles have parents who also have a history of violence. "Kids .
. . have become vicious, very violent," says Marvin Wolfgang, a University of
Pennsylvania criminologist who wrote a book on youth crime, The Subculture of
Violence.

Between 1982 and 1992, violent crimes per 100,000 population rose in both rural
areas and small cities. GOP pollster Glen Bolger calls it "the suburbanization"
of crime.

"You should be able to go shopping in a suburban shopping center and not worry
about getting raped on your way to the car in the parking lot," says Cuomo.

Handguns were used in 55.4% of all homicides in 1992, up from 43.5% in 1982.
Since 1986, firearm murders of children have risen 143% compared with 30% for
adults.

"Kids and people in the community say that everybody else has a gun, they want a
gun," says Cuomo. "It has just kind of spiralled upward in this mad cycle, and
now it's exploding. And people in every part of the country are frightened by it
and they want us to respond."

Tonight, Clinton will vow to do that. He and his aides began calling the issue a
priority after his vacation last August. He highlighted the topic in speeches
last year in Memphis and Los Angeles. Clinton reads about crime every morning in
The Washington Post metro section. Among headlines Monday: "Man Killed in
Shootout," "Woman Shot Driving."

But Clinton heads into the speech with the public divided over the job he's
doing so far on crime. One in 3 approve of his management of the problem, a
number steady since August, and 42% are confident he can reduce the amount of
violent crime.

James Fotis of Law Enforcement Alliance of America, a police and victims
advocacy group, says Clinton better put dollars - for prisons and boot camps -
behind his rhetoric.

"Politicians have finally realized that people are becoming more and more afraid
to step out of their homes and even in their homes," he says. "But what they've
done up to this point are things that make people feel good. It takes money."

In Congress, the crime debate boils down to gun control legislation and other
laws vs. a comprehensive approach that includes more mandatory sentencing and
reforms.

"Nothing is going to stop violent crime except tough sentencing," says Sen.
Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.

How to pay for anti-crime initiatives is unclear. The Senate passed a $ 22
billion crime bill last session - to be paid for by savings from Vice President
Gore's reinventing government proposal. Others want that money spent elsewhere.

The Senate bill includes the three-time-loser provision. The House likely will
vote on a similar bill this session.

Like the Senate, the House has approved more money for more cops and boot camps.
But other big ticket items - massive new prison construction and increasing the
number of crimes punishable by death - will face a rough road in the House,
where liberals have enough clout to block them.

Gun control is a certain agenda item. The Brady law, with a five-day waiting
period and background check, was just the beginning. Gun control advocates will
try to restrict gun purchases further, to ban semi-automatic weapons and armor
piercing bullets, and to strictly regulate gun dealers.

"Clearly there is the political will to do something," says Rep. Charles
Schumer, D-N.Y.

Cuomo says Clinton's leadership will be tested by this issue:

"When the people are as angry as they are now, and as eager for strong
responses, the leader must make sure the strength that he or she demonstrates is
intelligent." Clinton must "make clear that there is no single magic solution."

Small cities new victim of violent crime

LENGTH: 223 words


''We have the same problems of fast money from selling drugs that the big cities
have,'' says John Perdue, a Youngstown, Ohio, detective.

But numbers from the preliminary FBI Uniform Crime Report - for 187 cities with
a population of 100,000 or more - show big cities still have a violent crime
rate 57 percent higher than small cities.

Last year's violent crimes:

- Most violent city. Atlanta, with 3,576 per 100,000 people - a 23 percent
increase.

''It's not something that we can take any pride in,'' says Rep. John Lewis,
D-Ga. He blames an influx of drug dealers fleeing crackdowns in Florida and
coastal areas.

- Least violent city. Cedar Rapids, Iowa, with 146 per 100,000 people, a 16
percent decrease.

- The 187 cities' average. 993 per 100,000, up 6.2 percent.

Other findings from the survey per 100,000 people:

- Murder. Worst: Washington, 59. Best: Amherst Town, N.Y.; Ann Arbor, Mich.; and
Livonia, Mich, all zero.

- Assaults. Worst: Atlanta, 2,023. Best: Cedar Rapids, Iowa, 63.

- Rape. Worst: Flint, Mich., 187. Best: Cedar Rapids, 6.

- Robberies. Worst: Newark, N.J., 1,386. Best: Sterling Heights, Mich., 44.

Miami Beach led in overall crime - which includes burglary, larceny and car
theft - with 17,592 per 100,000 people. Amherst Town, N.Y., had the best rate
with 3,034. National average: 8,823.

Clinton Seeks To Cut Crime Among Youth

BYLINE: AP

SECTION: Section 1; Page 19; Column 6; National Desk

LENGTH: 339 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 19


President Clinton said today that he wanted to stem juvenile violence by
expanding to 10 more cities a program that traces firearms used in crime scenes,
a step he said would be "locking the back door" on illegal gun sales.

"Make no mistake -- gun traffickers are funneling guns to lawless youth," Mr.
Clinton said today in his weekly radio address. "We know how they operate, and
we intend to shut them down."

Since the program promoted by the President, the Youth Crime Gun Interdiction
Initiative, started in 17 cities last year, law-enforcement agencies have
tracked 37,000 crime guns to their sources. That is almost twice as many as the
number traced the year before, according to Treasury Department statistics.

Also, for the first time in seven years, the rate of juvenile crime dropped --
by 2.9 percent in 1995, Administration figures showed.

But "children are still killing children," Mr. Clinton said. He said it would
take an expanded gun-tracing program, the continuation of background checks on
gun buyers and the cooperation of Congress to clamp down on that.

Mr. Clinton said he was dismayed that the Senate had not passed a law requiring
Federal firearms dealers to provide child-safety locks on weapons.

The President also urged law-enforcement agencies to continue doing background
checks on prospective gun buyers, despite the Supreme Court's decision last
month to strike down the part of the Brady law that mandates such checks.

A Treasury analysis of the interdiction program found that 4 of 10 guns used in
crimes that were recovered by the police had come from juveniles.

The program has begun in 17 cities: Atlanta; Baltimore; Birmingham, Ala.;
Boston; Bridgeport, Conn.; Cleveland; Inglewood, Calif.; Jersey City; Memphis;
Milwaukee; New York; Richmond; St. Louis; Salinas, Calif.; San Antonio; Seattle,
and Washington.

The program will be expanded to 10 more cities: Los Angeles; Philadelphia;
Chicago; Detroit; Houston; Miami; Tucson, Ariz.; Minneapolis; Gary, Ind., and
Cincinnati.

HOUSTON FINDS THAT DRAMATIZING CRIME DOES PAY

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING

SECTION: Section A; Page 8, Column 2; National Desk

LENGTH: 869 words

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Jan. 22


On a chilly winter evening in a residential neighborhood not far from downtown,
a small foreign car jerked to a stop, a door flew open and a body tumbled out on
the pavement. The car, tires screeching, sped down the street.

Then, like a newsreel run in reverse, the little car stopped, backed up, the
door swung open again and the victim climbed back in the car to repeat the
bizarre scene again and again.

After the scene was played out four times, the director, Nik Hagler, declared it
a take. The Houston Police Department and televison station KTRK had videotaped
their 160th Crime of the Week, the keystone of the city's long-running ''Crime
Stoppers'' program.

Electronic 'Wanted' Poster

''Crime Stoppers,'' the video age equivalent of the ''wanted'' poster, uses
mainly television but also radio and newspapers to dramatize unsolved crimes,
offering a reward to viewers for information that leads to solving the crime.
The program, begun in Albuquerque in 1976, has since spread to 450 communities
in 46 states and Canada.

According to Crime Stoppers U.S.A.  Inc., a national organization that promotes
and serves as an information clearinghouse for local programs, some 39,000
felonies have been solved through Crime Stoppers, $148 million in stolen
property and drugs recovered or seized, and 10,000 felons indicted.

New York City began broadcasting the program in October and credits information
provided by viewers so far with solving 65 violent crimes, including 16 bank
robberies committed by the same man. The program is broadcast on WABC-TV.

$1,000 Rewards Offered

Houston's program is one of the most effective in the country. Each week for
three years, variations of the body- dumping scene have been played out across
the city: murders, rapes, burglaries, robberies, assaults, the gamut of serious
urban crime. The re-enactments of unsolved crimes are broadcast several times a
week on KTRK- TV, the city's leading news station, and there are radio and
newspaper versions as well.

At the end of each KTRK-TV dramatization in Houston, the news anchorman, Dave
Ward, delivers a standard tagline: ''Crime Stoppers will pay a one thousand
dollar cash reward this week for information leading to the arrest and grand
jury indictment of the person responsible'' for the crime. The program has paid
$423,700 in rewards so far, financed by private donations from businesses and
individuals.

The Houston program is credited with clearing 2,581 felony crimes, including 56
capital murders, 79 non- capital or attempted murders, 392 burglaries, 401 auto
thefts, 369 robberies, 430 narcotics cases, 48 rapes and seven kidnappings.
Crime Stoppers officials report that the police have recovered more than $12.5
million in stolen property and confiscated nearly $14 million in narcotics as a
result of Crime Stoppers tips.

On the strength of its success so far, Houston is planning to expand the number
of officers taking calls from witnesses or people offering information, doubling
available reward money and giving wider publicity to the local Crime Stoppers
telephone hot line.

''We figure we can double our arrest statistics,'' said Betty Milligan,
executive director of the Houston program. ''We're looking at 2,500 more in one
year, as much as we've had in three.''



Most Involve Other Crimes

Although the 60- to 90-second crime re-enactments can have great dramatic impact
on viewers, most tips and arrests involve cases other than the ''Crime of the
Week,'' officials said.

In New York, only two of the 16 dramatized cases have been solved, although one
of them cleared the 16 bank holdups that had investigators stymied.

One reason is that the New York program is only four months old, and word has
not circulated among those most likely to help: the criminal community, those
with the information willing to sell it, or, just as often, ready to inform
because of a personal grudge.

''We get husbands turning in wives, wives turning in husbands, we've even had
mothers turn in their sons,'' said Sgt. George Vanderhule, coordinator of the
Austin Police Department's Crime Stoppers Unit, which is also considered one of
the more successful programs in the country.

'We Don't Quibble'

Informants, who are often themselves involved in crimes - one Houston informant
was reported to have collected $12,000 to $15,000 turning in criminal associates
- are given an identification number to protect their anonymity. If the tip
results in an indictment, the source presents the number at a pre-arranged place
and collects an envelope containing the cash, no questions asked.

''We don't quibble,'' said Betty Milligan, even though the reward recipients are
themselves often less than savory. Law-abiding citizens, she said, ''don't often
know a lot of felons.''

But word of the program and the rewards passes slowly, even with mass media
help.

''So far it's good,'' said Lieut. Pat Harnett, director of the New York program.
''But we have a long way to go in getting the word out. In Houston it's reached
the street level, the fringe players in the criminal community. We're looking to
reach more of those fringe players.''

Dubuque among safest smaller cities; City is ranked 16th out of 117 communities

BYLINE: M.D. KITTLE

SECTION: Front; Pg. a1

LENGTH: 568 words

DATELINE: Dubuque


With the backdrop of rising terror alerts and security fears in the wake of this
week's bombings in London, a new study shows Dubuque is a pretty safe place to
be.

The Farmers Insurance Group of Companies ranked Dubuque the 16th most secure
place to live in the United States, among 117 small cities with populations
under 150,000.

Bismarck, N.D., ranked No. 1 on the second annual list, followed by State
College, Pa. Dubuque ranked just behind St. Cloud, Minn., and ahead of Fargo,
N.D.

"It's a form of protection," said Jeff Beyer, senior vice president of Los
Angeles-based Farmers Insurance. "Whether it's employment security, a stable
climate or a low crime rate, we'd all like to find a place to live or work that
provides us that feeling of well-being."

The insurer's study, conducted by Portland, Ore.-based demographic researcher
Sperling's BestPlaces, tracks crime statistics, risk of natural disasters,
extreme weather and job loss.

Dubuque boasted one of the lowest crime rates among the cities in the survey.
According to the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting statistics, the Dubuque
metropolitan area (including all of Dubuque County) recorded 303 violent crimes
per 100,000 population in 2003. That number is a bit deceiving, however, since
the metro's population is just above 90,000, according to the most recent Census
Bureau numbers.

The Dubuque metro recorded 2,331 property crimes per 100,000 population - again,
with the same mathematical caveat.

Dubuque also fared well in the survey's employment gauge. While the study
indicates job growth declined 3.1 percent over the past five years, the average
unemployment rate was 3 percent in the measurable period.

"You're unemployment rate and job growth has a lot to do with feeling secure,"
said Bert Sperling, president of BestPlaces. "A high unemployment rate is like a
cancer affecting a community."

In a time of terrorism threats and violent crime, officials say safety is not
just a matter of peace of mind, it's an increasingly effective economic
development sales pitch - to companies looking to expand and employees looking
to build a life.

"We have made the case and continue to make the case that we are able to match
excitement and safety, and that is a powerful recruiting tool," said Steward
Sandstrom, president and chief executive officer of the Dubuque Area Chamber of
Commerce.

Despite an occasional bout with high winds, hail or the rare tornado, the
security ranking found Dubuque didn't have much to worry about in the way of
natural disasters. But the metro, perhaps not surprisingly, didn't fare so well
in the "extreme weather" category.

The gauge counted the number of days temperatures exceeded 90 degrees or dropped
below zero, as well as the incidents of heavy rain or significant snowfall.

"This is where the danger score was higher for Dubuque," Sperling said.

Dubuque has picked up ground in a number of national economic and community
rankings in recent years.

Another ranking compiled by Sperling's firm did not look upon Dubuque so
favorably, however. Cities Ranked and Rated, published in 2004, lists Dubuque at
No. 311 among the nation's 331 metropolitan areas. The book's rankings track
everything from a city's arts and leisure, to transportation and the economy.

Sperling said he doesn't read too much into the data, which he helped to
compile, calling it a "snapshot in time."

WHAT RAPE?

BYLINE: By JEREMY KOHLER Of the Post-Dispatch

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A01

LENGTH: 2684 words


* St. Louis police report far fewer rapes than other cities. Why? Officers write
memos instead of incident reports for some rapes. Others, police count in a
category of minor crimes that are not reported to the FBI.

Latisha Williams stepped into a stranger's car one night in June 2003. A grave
mistake. They ended up at his house where, she said, he locked the door and
raped her.

Williams, then 18, said she called police, who took notes and never called back.
For over a year and a half, she said, she assumed the man was locked up.

But there was another reason her phone didn't ring. The officer did not believe
a crime had been committed. He wrote an informal memo but no formal incident
report.

The Post-Dispatch disclosed Sunday that for at least two years, St. Louis police
avoided writing full reports on at least hundreds of incidents called in as
crimes. It meant they would not be counted in the city's crime statistics, a
clear violation of FBI guidelines and department policy. It made the city look
safer than it was, while depriving people like Williams of further investigation
of their claims.

After the newspaper asked about the practice, the department ordered it stopped.

Even when St. Louis police do make full reports of sex crimes, they often
violate FBI rules again by relegating many cases -- crimes that other
departments call rapes -- to a lesser crime category not included in national
figures.

The newspaper's review of minor-crime data identified 169 incidents over five
years that appear to fit the rape definition but were filed as "other sex crimes
." There were 37 in 2003. Counting them as rapes would have lifted the year's
total to 118.

The result is easy to see. St. Louis police reported just 81 rapes in 2003.
That's fewer than counted by Sioux Falls, S.D.; Fort Collins, Colo.; Boise,
Idaho; New Bedford, Mass.; Lansing, Mich.; Las Cruces, N.M.; and Lafayette, La.
-- all cities that did not have even one-fifth as many overall crimes as St.
Louis that year.

St. Louis had more crime in 2003 than Indianapolis, Kansas City, Boston,
Cleveland, Oklahoma City, Minneapolis, Milwaukee, Portland, Ore., Charlotte,
N.C., or Wichita, Kan. But those cities, and many more, recorded from three to
eight times more rapes.

Phoenix doubled St. Louis' 2003 crime total but had seven times as many rapes.
Philadelphia had 60 percent more crime than St. Louis -- but 12 times as many
rapes.

Richard Rosenfeld, a criminologist at the University of Missouri at St. Louis,
agreed to analyze rape numbers for the Post-Dispatch. Based on various data, he
estimated that St. Louis should have about 214 rapes in 2003 -- nearly three
times more than it recorded.

St. Louis police recorded 68 rapes in the first 10 months of 2004.

Two scenarios help illustrate what St. Louis does differently. In the first, a
woman drinks too much at a party and passes out. Two men drag her into a
bedroom. Each has sex with her before she wakes. In the second, a woman is
driven home by her date. He pulls over and makes an advance. She resists. He
persists. She says no. He wins.

The FBI calls those rapes. So do major cities like Boston and San Diego. In
neither example did the woman consent to sexual intercourse.

But St. Louis police call them "sexual assaults" and list those reports in a
crime category that does not show up in national statistics. Police here ignore
the FBI and Missouri guidelines and report as rapes only those crimes that fit
the state statute's narrow definition of forcible rape.

Sgt. Stephen Dougherty, a supervisor in the St. Louis sex-crimes unit, said in
an interview in November it's a rape here only when the attacker causes or
threatens harm beyond the rape itself, or drugs the victim.

Missouri's other major city police departments, Kansas City and Springfield,
follow the FBI and state standards, regardless of what law the prosecutor might
use to charge the offender.

"A rape is unwanted vaginal intercourse," said Sgt. Keith Kirchhoff, a
supervisor in the Kansas City police sex-crimes unit. "When it goes to the
prosecutor, they might call it whatever, but we pretty much call a rape a rape."

Mike Owen, a detective sergeant with the Springfield, Mo., police, said, "If
it's intercourse without the other person's consent, we would consider that
rape. The (forcible rape) statute may not fit, but we consider it rape here."

How St. Louis police classify rapes has repercussions beyond making the city
look safer than it is.

As in most major departments, St. Louis police have a special sex-crimes unit,
which handles the most heinous sex cases, including "forcible" rapes.

But many cases classified as sexual assaults are shunted back to the police
district detectives, a legion of about 75 generalists whose caseload includes
tens of thousands of felonies and misdemeanors each year, from shoplifting to
street robberies.

The Post-Dispatch talked with sex-crimes units in several U.S. cities and found
that none place rape investigations in the hands of district detectives.

"We would not allow an area station to handle a rape case," said Sgt. Janet
Wright, a sex-crimes supervisor with San Diego police. "They're good detectives,
but they're trained in generalized investigations -- not in specific sexual
assault crimes."

How this affects the quality of St. Louis rape investigations is unknown.

The Post-Dispatch filed a request under the Missouri Sunshine Law in November
for access to all rape reports from 2003 and to all sexual assault reports from
one month of that year, June. The Police Department said that would be too
cumbersome. The newspaper pared the request to about 20 rape and sexual assault
reports written in June 2003 -- the same month as Latisha Williams' case.

The department, to date, has not complied, saying that because of
confidentiality statutes, it would provide only six reports, and then only if
the newspaper paid $700 in administrative costs.

"Not in our system"

Police had no proof that Latisha Williams was lying. The patrol officer who
wrote the memo had only the word of an unmarried teen, pregnant with her second
child and living in public housing with her extended family.

The attending physician at Barnes-Jewish Hospital indicated on Williams' medical
report, which she provided to a reporter, that it appeared the teen had been
raped.

The memo on Williams was initialed by Lt. George Venegoni, who coordinated crime
memos for the 4th District, roughly the downtown area, at the request of his
commander, Capt. Larry O'Toole, who has since been promoted to major.

Venegoni, reached by a reporter, said he needed approval to be interviewed.
O'Toole did not return phone messages last week. Lt. John Harper, who oversees
sex crime investigations, sent an e-mail referring a reporter to the department
spokesman, Richard Wilkes.

In response to a reporter's request for comment from Chief Joe Mokwa and some
other key department figures, Wilkes faxed an unsigned statement on Wednesday
saying police had no comment on crime reporting practices.

The request to interview Mokwa was repeated Friday, and met by the same answer.

The Williams case memo was one of about 70 obtained by the Post-Dispatch from
police sources last year.

A reporter knocked on Williams' door in October and showed her the memo. Tears
welled in her eyes as a reporter read it out loud. The officer had mangled her
statement into something that wasn't believable, she said.

It reflected some of what she told him, but certain details were wrong, she
said. The way he wrote it made it seem like she had changed her story, she said.

"I told the truth," she insisted.

Even more puzzling for her was that the memo lacked key investigative details,
such as addresses where she told the police they could find her attacker. There
was no mention that she had been to the hospital. Or that a nurse had swabbed
evidence for a "rape kit."

But the memo did offer hope that someone else in the department might have
looked deeper. The officer signed off by saying he would forward the memo to the
sex-crimes unit "for any additional investigation."

Williams, who is now 20, found even more hope in boilerplate language at the top
of her memo, and which is at the top of every memo.

The words said: "It may be necessary, with additional investigation in a
controlled atmosphere to determine that a crime has actually been committed and
should be officially reported through normal channels."

Surely, that was done, Williams said.

Police reports are kept centrally at police headquarters, 1200 Clark Avenue.
People can buy copies of their own reports for $5. Williams wanted hers.

A reporter accompanied her to headquarters. The guard at the front desk directed
her through a metal detector, down a dusty corridor to the record room. There,
she filled out a card: Latisha Williams. Sexual assault. June 18, 2003.

She took a seat. Ten minutes passed.

"Latisha Williams," the clerk called. There was a problem.

Was she sure the incident occurred in St. Louis? Was her name spelled any other
way? Was the date correct?

Williams nodded.

"I know it's frustrating," the clerk said, "but you're not in our system."

Williams agreed to let the newspaper identify her by name and photograph her.
She said she wanted her story to be told.

First, though, she had to call her father and tell him that she had been raped.

"I don't want him to see it in the paper first," she said.

"If you don't do it..."

That night in June, Williams said, she and her friend were walking to her
cousin's house. A Ford pulled up on O'Fallon Street, a few blocks from her
apartment in the Cochran Gardens public housing complex, just north of downtown.

(A reporter could not locate the friend, who is 21. Williams said they had not
spoken in several months. The friend's grandfather said he would relay a
message, if possible but said he didn't know how to reach her.)

The man in the Ford offered them a ride. Williams said the friend, at first,
seemed to know him. After a brief stop at her cousin's apartment, they went to
his house.

He wanted sex. Williams said her friend was willing, initially, but Williams was
not.

They were still talking when, in a terrifying turn, a third woman showed up with
news: A drug debt would not be paid. It sent the man into a rage, Williams said.
He slapped the woman, then threw a television and a radio at her, she said. The
woman fled in tears.

Williams said she expected to get the same if she refused sex. Now her friend
appeared scared, too.

The man ushered the teens into his bedroom, she said.

"He said, 'We're all going to have sex with each other,'" Williams said. "'If
you don't do it, I'm not taking you home.'

"He kept saying, 'You all better get home the best way you can if you don't do
this.'"

Williams didn't resist. She said she was afraid for her baby. She was afraid of
being left on the street in an unfamiliar neighborhood, six miles from home.

Williams said that during the rape, someone outside fired gunshots. She
remembers four. She said she heard the woman from earlier, shouting. Williams
surmised that the woman had returned with others to avenge the beating. The man
loaded bullets into a gun and ran out of the room, Williams said.

She and her friend lay on the floor and waited.

"While we were on the floor, I asked, 'Do you even know him?'" Williams said.
"She said no."

The shooters fled after a few minutes, she said. Not long after, the man drove
her home. It was after midnight. She went to sleep.

She awoke early, crying. Her brother, Lionel Taylor, called 911.

The memo had a few variations. The officer wrote that Williams told him her
assailant had shot at his own house. He wrote that in Williams' initial version,
she said the man had beaten up her friend, but that later she revised her story
to say a third woman, not her friend, had been beaten.

The memo drew the conclusion that Williams had consented to sex.

"When asked again why she said she would agree to have sex with (the suspect)
rather than run away, she stated that she needed a ride home," he wrote.

If police had taken Williams seriously, they might have learned more about her
alleged rapist, in his late 20s.

It was not the first time he was accused of being violent to a woman. A year
earlier, in June 2002, a woman went to court in St. Louis to seek a restraining
order against him. A judge denied it.

"He came to my house and I asked him for my house key," the woman wrote in her
petition. "He became angry and started threatening to burn my house down and
that he hopes my children are in there too. He tried to push his way back into
my house and he slapped me in my face as I was closing the door."

A reporter reached the man at his job downtown. In a brief interview, he denied
raping anyone and said he didn't recall sex with two teens any night in June
2003.

"If it happened a year ago, police would have come and talked to me," he said.

"Hard to understand"

Williams is not the only alleged rape victim in St. Louis for whom police did
not write a report.

Of about 70 memos obtained by a reporter, seven involved allegations of sex
crimes. In one of them, an officer wrote about a prostitute who complained she
was raped on Feb. 6, 2003. The unidentified 35-year-old prostitute has a
previous conviction of making a false police report.

The woman said her attacker was a man she picked up one night at a supermarket.
They smoked crack in her car and she agreed to perform oral sex for $50. He
wanted more.

"It wasn't something I wouldn't consider, but I wouldn't do it, and it made him
mad," the woman, 35, told the Post-Dispatch. She said the rape "was awful. You
can't explain it."

She contested only one detail in the memo. It said she admitted to knowing her
attacker for more than six months. "I had never seen him before," she said. "He
was a trick. That's probably why they don't consider it a rape."

Kathleen Hanrahan is executive director of the St. Louis Regional Sexual Assault
Center, based at the YWCA in Clayton. Her agency dispatches a volunteer whenever
a rape victim shows up at an emergency room in the St. Louis area.

She works closely with the city police. She said she has known about the use of
crime memos for some time.

Victims have occasionally called Hanrahan to complain that a police officer did
not follow up after an initial meeting at a hospital. In those instances,
Hanrahan said, she immediately calls Harper, the lieutenant who oversees the
sex-crimes unit.

Harper has a statewide reputation for sensitivity toward victims. Hanrahan said
she admired and respected him.

But Harper sometimes has to hunt for a crime memo. Sometimes he can't find it,
she said.

"Obviously, the memo system, it's hard to understand," Hanrahan said. "But when
that's happened, we've always been able to go back to them and file a report."

Hanrahan was reluctant to criticize the St. Louis police. Rape victims have far
bigger problems than the St. Louis police, she said.

Some hospitals treat victims coldly, traumatizing them all over again. Some
nurses aren't trained to collect rape evidence. Many suburban police departments
don't even bother to return her calls, she said.

The St. Louis police -- Harper and Dougherty in particular -- are the best thing
going, she said.

As close as she is to the process, Hanrahan said she had no way of assessing
whether police do all they can to investigate rapes. That isn't her role. What's
more important to her is that authorities give victims comfort and respect, she
said.

"The issue to me is so much bigger," she said. "We don't expect hardly any of
the victims to get satisfaction from the criminal justice system."

There might have been a chance for Hanrahan to champion for Latisha Williams.

After the emergency room visit, a volunteer tried four times to check on
Williams' well-being, Hanrahan's records show. Williams acknowledged that she
never returned the calls.

"We could have done something if she had," Hanrahan said.

Williams said she had just wanted to put the incident behind her.

She soon had her baby -- her second son. Her focus turned toward day-to-day
survival.

"I was depressed and just wanted to forget about it."

So, apparently, did the police.

5% Increase Reported in County Crime; Aggravated Assaults Rise; Most Serious
Offenses Drop

Amy Argetsinger, Washington Post Staff Writer

SECTION: WEEKLY - MD; Pg. M01

LENGTH: 471 words


An increase in aggravated assaults -- especially between husbands and wives --
helped nudge the total number of crimes upward in Anne Arundel County in 1996,
according to county police.

But the impact of the 5.1 percent increase in overall crime was offset, in part,
by decreases in most types of serious crime, ranging from murder to arson,
according to crime statistics released last week.

The figures released by the Anne Arundel County police do not include crimes
committed within the City of Annapolis.

In Annapolis, the rate of serious crime increased 1.5 percent, according to
figures released this week by the city police. Aggravated assaults increased to
277 incidents last year, compared with 241 the year before. Car thefts also
increased in the city, with 172 incidents reported, up from 136 in 1995. There
were four homicides in the city -- two of which remain unsolved -- compared with
two in 1995.

In the rest of county, the number of aggravated assaults increased from 837 in
1995 to 979 last year. Most striking about the 17 percent increase was that
there were actually fewer assaults with knives or guns. Instead, Officer Vaughn
Dykes said, there was a rise in the number of attacks with "weapons of
opportunity" -- sticks, baseball bats, wooden planks, "whatever is at hand."

Police also said assaults in which the victims were attacked by their spouses
accounted for most of the increase. However, police did not provide the number
of domestic assaults.

County police noted that most aggravated assault cases involved people who knew
each other and were not random attacks.

The number of burglaries increased 12.9 percent last year -- from 2,983 in 1995
to 3,368 in 1996 -- after a small decrease the year before. But most of the
increase was attributable to a rise in the number of break-ins at storage and
construction sites -- possibly because there were more construction projects
underway in the county in 1996, police said.

Meanwhile, residential break-ins decreased 6.8 percent, police said.

Anne Arundel police saw 11 homicides in 1996, compared with 16 in 1995. Police
noted that nine of last year's cases have been closed. Only two -- a Pasadena
man found beaten to death in his home in December and a Baltimore woman whose
body was found behind a Glen Burnie shopping center in April -- remain unsolved,
police said.

Police said 74 rape cases were reported in 1996, down from 83 in 1995 and 112 in
1994 -- a trend officers attributed to public education programs that focused on
personal safety.

Robberies decreased slightly, to 564 last year from 577 in 1995, which was a
12.7 percent increase from 1994's figures.

Thefts were up 4.7 percent, in part because of an increase in the number of auto
parts stolen. Bike thefts, however, decreased, police said.

Crime stats shield brutal reality / Teen violence, gun use taint FBI findings

BYLINE: Sam Vincent Meddis

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 9A

LENGTH: 628 words


Some criminal justice experts take little comfort in a new FBI report that shows
the rate of reported crime dropped 4% last year.

"We're on the verge now of another crime wave," predicts James Fox, Northeastern
University's criminal justice dean.

The chief reason for pessimism is demographic: The teen-age population -
increasingly violent and crime-prone - is expected to grow.

Even Sunday's report - citing 5,660 crimes per 100,000 people in 1992 vs. 5,898
in 1991 - failed to find any appreciable lessening of violence.

Fewer property crimes were behind the overall drop.

After compiling crime reports from more than 16,000 state and local police
agencies, the FBI found that:

The 1992 rate of 757.5 violent crimes per 100,000 population remained about the
same as the 1991 rate of 758.1.

Violent crime in 1992 was 41% above the 1983 figure.

Reports of violent crimes to police actually grew 1% - to 1,932,274 last year
from about 1,911,767 in 1991.
The FBI report also shows firearms are playing a greater role in killings.

Even though the murder rate dropped 5% in 1992, firearms were used in 15,337, or
68%, of the 22,540 homicides in which the cause of death was reported. Firearms
were used in 10,895, or 61%, of the 17,971 killings in 1988.

Across the nation high-profile incidents like schoolyard shootings and the
murder of foreign tourists are feeding the public's fear of crime.

"There's a greater level of fear," says Police Chief Darrel Stephens of St.
Petersburg, Fla., where reports of crime dropped nearly 5% in 1992.

"It's as strong (here) as it is in other parts of the country."

Last week after a 4-year-old girl, shot in the head while watching a
neighborhood football game, died, Washington, D.C., Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly
called for National Guard troops to help safeguard the city's streets.

Robert Bohm, a University of North Carolina criminologist, sees similarities
between current violence and that of the 1930s, when Prohibition-era gangsters
fought for territories. Today, the battles appear to be over drug turf.

Still, some are encouraged by the apparent leveling off in violent crime
reports.

"It tells me we're on the right course," says Paul McNulty of the First Freedom
Coalition, a Washington-based group advocating stiff sentencing and other
get-tough criminal justice policies.

McNulty, former Justice Department communications chief in the Bush
administration, says more prisons are necessary to make a bigger dent in violent
crime: "We need to be more aggressive in apprehending those violent criminals
who account for that high rate."

Northeastern's Fox warns that the worst may be yet to come.

Between now and the year 2005, he says, the number of young people between the
crime-prone ages of 15-19 will rise 23% - a population so large that it could
outstrip any reasonable prison resources.

Violent crime rises steadily The number of crimes reported in the USA dropped
last year, though violent crimes went up. Number of firearmS homicide victims
Year    homicides
1988     10,895
1992     15,377

U.S. prisons hold nearly 1 million

The nation's prisons are fast approaching the 1-million population mark -
925,247 inmates in June and growing by 1,600 a week, a new study says.

That's nearly triple the 329,821 inmates in state and federal prisons in 1980.

Among the Justice Department report's findings:

The growth of 42,000 inmates in the first six months of this year was far higher
than the 31,500 added in the first half of 1992.

Texas and West Virginia had the sharpest increases, 11.8% and 11.1%
respectively.

Louisiana had the highest incarceration rate - 505 inmates per 100,000 people.
North Dakota had the lowest - 69 per 100,000 population.

Violent crime up 5% in 1989

LENGTH: 1007 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON; NEW YORK; PINE BLUFF, Ark.; CROWNSVILLE, Md.; LOS ANGELES;
CHICAGO; SAN DIEGO; CINCINNATI; INDIANAPOLIS; BEACH CITY, Texas



Murders, rapes and other violent crime in the United States rose 5 percent in
1989 over the previous year, the FBI reported Saturday. The total number of
crimes increased two percent. The FBI said there were an estimated 21,500
murders last year, a 4 percent increase over 1988, but 7 percent below the
record rate in 1980. Rapes were up 2 percent to a reported total of 94,504.
Robbery and assault, the other offenses in the violent crime category, rose 7
percent and 5 percent respectively. Washington, D.C., had the highest murder
rate in 1989, with 72 slayings per 100,000 people.  Detroit and Atlanta ranked
second and third. The FBI's Uniform Crime Reports compile information submitted
by about 16,000 law enforcement agencies nationwide representing about 96
percent of the U.S. population.
 Barry jury breaks for weekend
 WASHINGTON Jurors in Mayor Marion Barry's cocaine and perjury trial deliberated
four hours Saturday and then stopped work for the rest of the weekend. Before
halting deliberations until Monday, the panel asked the judge for another look
at more than 150 prosecution and defense exhibits. The jurors are sifting
through six weeks of testimony from 44 witnesses, including 10 of Barry's
friends who said they saw him use cocaine some 200 times dating back to 1983.

 Avianca jet had sufficient fuel
 NEW YORK An Avianca jet that was given emergency clearance to land on Tuesday
night was not dangerously low on fuel, according to a Federal Aviation
Administration official. Air traffic controllers had taken the unusual step of
declaring a flight emergency for Avianca Flight 20, clearing it for an immediate
landing at Kennedy International Airport, because of confusion over how much
fuel the jet had left. FAA officials and a controller on duty Tuesday night said
that the pilot of Flight 20, a Boeing 767 en route from Colombia, told
controllers that the plane had only 15 minutes' worth of fuel left. But John
Walker, assistant director of the FAA's air-traffic division in New York, said
Friday that the plane had about two hours' worth of fuel left when it landed and
that there may have been a misunderstanding. In January, 73 people died when an
Avianca jet crashed in Cove Neck, N.Y. after running out of fuel.
 Pasco man drives into diner
 PINE BLUFF, Ark.  A Pasco County man, apparently distraught over family
problems, warned employees and customers inside Lavender's Barn Restaurant
before plowing through it in his rented car, officials said. Larry Dennis

 11-year-old finds easy money
 CROWNSVILLE, Md.  An 11-year-old who publishes an environmental newsletter says
he is more concerned about the economy now that MasterCard has issued him a gold
card with a $ 5,000 credit limit. Tommy Mullaney filled out the application
before he went to summer camp, stating his birthday, Nov. 10, 1978; occupation,
student and publisher; and income $ 5 a week allowance. The card was waiting for
him in the mail when he returned last month. "I jumped up and down and said "Wow
' The hologram on it was cool," Tommy said. "But it sure made me wonder about
who was running the bank." Loraine Person of First National Bank said the bank
made a mistake in issuing the card, but it does not know how it happened. Tommy
says the experience has made him think about the economy. "I'm very scared about
how safe my money is right now if they are giving it away to kids like me." The
card has been canceled by Tommy's mother.

The Commissioner vs. the Criminologists

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

SECTION: Section 1;  Page 43;  Column 4;  Metropolitan Desk

LENGTH: 918 words

DATELINE: BOSTON, Nov. 18


Combating drug dealers and gang leaders, the New York City Police Commissioner,
William J. Bratton, has declared victory after victory in his efforts to clean
up the streets. But he returned to his native Boston on Friday night to confront
another tough crowd: criminologists who have withheld their accolades for his
department's crime-fighting efforts.

In a debate before the American Society of Criminology, Mr. Bratton challenged
some of the nation's most esteemed crime experts to rethink their theories
linking the decline in reported crime in New York City to the easing of the
crack-cocaine craze, to the aging of the baby boom generation or to a national
trend of decreasing violent crime.

"I'm here tonight to play the role of resident gadfly," Mr. Bratton said. "I'm
here to tell you that police make a difference, and we do take offense at some
of your colleagues saying otherwise."

Citing the city's 40 percent drop in homicides and 30 percent decline in
robberies since 1993, Mr. Bratton credited Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani for setting
a tone of intolerance for graffiti vandalism, public drinking and other behavior
that threatens neighborhood stability. But most important, he said, was the
effort to "re-engineer" the police force away from reactive, random patrol work
toward new, active strategies that focus on high-crime areas and encourage
uniform officers to make narcotics and gun arrests.

"We're changing behavior in New York City," Mr. Bratton said, citing public high
school enrollment statistics that suggest that the number of young people, who
are responsible for a larger percentage of the city's crimes, is actually
growing at a time when crime is going down.

The criminologists said they were impressed by Mr. Bratton's remodeling of the
Police Department, and no one suggested the declines were due to sloppy or
dishonest accounting. But they said more study was needed to determine why crime
is dropping, and they expressed doubts that more profound social phenomena were
not also at work.

"I'm a grizzled veteran of other homicide drops and their press coverage," said
Franklin Zimring, a criminologist at the University of California at Berkeley,
noting that a Massachusetts gun control law was widely viewed as a panacea in
the mid-1970's, when violent crime was falling, only to prove later to be a
disappointment when homicide rates went back up.

A decade later, Mr. Zimring recalled, a sharp increase in the nation's prison
population was credited with another fall in the violent crime rate -- just
before the crack epidemic moved crime statistics up again.

"It was J. Edgar Hoover who told us that most homicide goes on beyond the
control or the ability of police to influence it," he said.

The debate was much anticipated in the world of law enforcement scholarship,
ever since Mr. Bratton promised last July to challenge all criminologists and
their theories and "knock them down like ducks in a row." Mr. Bratton's crime
strategist, Deputy Police Commissioner John Maple, mocked the criminologists
before the debate, saying, "They're all going to be up there with their wizard
hats on; you know, the ones with the half moons."

But in the end, the format of the event -- successive speeches with only a short
question and answer period -- inhibited both Mr. Bratton's lashing temper and
much lively debate. Many of the 400 crime experts said they left the discussion
with more questions than conclusions.

"Bratton may want to take more credit than he's due, but we have to study it,"
said Richard S. Frase, a professor at the University of Minnesota Law School.

"I'm not persuaded, because crime rates have gone up and down," said Freda
Adler, the outgoing president of the American Society of Criminology.

Alfred Blumstein, a Carnegie-Mellon University criminologist, partly conceded
the point to Mr. Bratton, saying that the causes for the decline in crime "are
multiple, and certainly policing is one of them."

But Mr. Blumstein noted that a doubling of the prison population since 1985 had
had an enormous impact on adult crime, and had so far negated a doubling in the
youth homicide rates over that same period. And he pointed to changes in drug
markets as another important reason for the fall in murder rates.

"As the drug markets have grown, they have matured," Mr. Blumstein argued, "and
as they mature some of the battles that went on among the aggressive
entrepreneurs who started that industry settled as they do in many other
industries -- either as explicit or implicit recognition of turf. And as that
happens there is a decrease in violence."

He said New York was one of several large cities in which violence associated
with drug turf wars was decreasing, while turf wars continue unabated in other
mostly smaller cities where drugs were slower to take hold in the 1980's and
have not yet run their cycle.

"It's striking that in a good number of the large cities in the last two or
three years we have indeed seen a decline in homicides," Mr. Blumstein
concluded.

Mr. Bratton countered that New York City was responsible for one-third of the
nation's reductions in murders and robberies and 70 percent of the decline in
automobile theft in recent years.

Through Nov. 12 in New York City, murder declined this year by 28 percent from
the same period in 1994, rape by 2 percent, robbery by 19 percent, felony
assault by 10 percent, burglary by 17 percent, grand larceny by 13 percent and
automobile theft by 25 percent.

Justice Departments Office of Justice Programs Awards Nearly $6 Million to
Project Safe Neighborhoods Program

LENGTH: 587  words


The Office of Justice Programs Bureau of Justice Assistance today awarded grants
totaling $5.7 million to create safer neighborhoods through a sustained
reduction in gang violence and gun crime.  The awards are funded under the 2016
Violent Gang and Gun Crime Reduction (Project Safe Neighborhoods) Program.  The
goal of PSN is to create safer neighborhoods through a sustained reduction in
gang violence and gun crime.

The program`s effectiveness is based on a cooperative approach and unified
strategies led by the local U.S. Attorney, a collaborative PSN task force of
federal, state, and local law enforcement, community members, and other key
partners.  The partners work to implement gang crime and gun violence
enforcement, intervention, and prevention initiatives, using data and research
with a local research partner.

"Gang violence and gun crime are two of the most formidable obstacles we face in
ensuring that every American lives in safe and secure communities," said
Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch. "These vital grants give jurisdictions the
resources they need to develop comprehensive, collaborative responses to the
most serious and destructive crimes.  By combining more effective enforcement
with closer cooperation, better data and expanded prevention initiatives,
Project Safe Neighborhoods helps communities make meaningful strides towards
ending violence, promoting peace, and restoring hope."

Although crime rates remain at historically low levels nationally, some
communities  and particularly, certain segments of those communities  continue
to struggle with gun crimes and gang violence, said Assistant Attorney General
Karol V. Mason. The funding provided through Project Safe Neighborhoods gives
these jurisdictions the resources they need to improve outreach and education,
prosecute gun and gang cases, and restore peace to their streets and homes.

This years recipients of approximately $500,000 each include Black Family
Development, Inc. of Michigan;  the California Governors Office of Emergency
Services; the Denver Police Department; City of Brookhaven, Georgia; the
Governors Office of Crime Control Prevention in Maryland; the Ohio Office of
Criminal Justice Services; and Texas Safe City Commission.  Awards of
approximately $300,000 went to the City of Greensboro, North Carolina; The
Justice Education Center, Inc. of Connecticut; the Wisconsin Department of
Justice; City of Columbia, South Carolina; and the Indiana Criminal Justice
Institute (two awards).  The City of Memphis, Tennessee, the City of Omaha,
Nebraska and Louisiana State University each received awards of $150,000.

Each applicant addressed the required PSN design features in its application:
(1) Partnerships; (2) Strategic Planning, Crime Analysis, and Research
Integration; (3) Training; (4) Outreach; and (5) Accountability and Data-Driven
efforts.

The Office of Justice Programs (OJP), headed by Assistant Attorney General Karol
V. Mason, provides federal leadership in developing the nations capacity to
prevent and control crime, administer justice, and assist victims. OJP has six
bureaus and offices: the Bureau of Justice Assistance; the Bureau of Justice
Statistics; the National Institute of Justice; the Office of Juvenile Justice
and Delinquency Prevention; the Office for Victims of Crime, and the Office of
Sex Offender Sentencing, Monitoring, Apprehending, Registering, and Tracking
(SMART). More information about OJP and its components can be found at

Cities confer on fighting gangs

BYLINE: Kamika Dunlap, Oakland Tribune

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 534 words


OAKLAND - Community leaders from throughout the state gathered Wednesday to plot
how they will gang up on the organizations connected with more than half the
crime in the West.

The California Cities Gang Prevention Network met for the first time Wednesday.
The network, with representatives from 13 cities, was formed to tackle gang
violence. The hope Is to prevent youth from joining gangs, to coax gang members
away from crime, and to bolster law enforcement.

"Our community as a whole is tired of gang violence," said Mike Martinez of the
San Bernardino County District Attorney's Office. "We realized this because of
the tragic murder of Mynisha Crenshaw."

The 11-year-old girl was killed when her San Bernardino apartment was strafed by
bullets while she was having dinner with her family. Eleven suspected gang
members have criminal charges in her death.

Mynisha's slaying spurred the community to action, resulting in a crackdown on
crime in the city.

At least 56 percent of all crime in the West moderately involves gangs,
according to a recent National Gang Assessment survey.

Organizers said the goal of the two-day network meeting is to help cities
develop local action plans to fight gang violence and reduce crime.

The event is sponsored by the National League of Cities and Oakland-based
National Council on Crime and Delinquency. Along with San Bernardino,
participating cities are Fresno, Oakland, Los Angeles, Oxnard, Richmond,
Sacramento, Salinas,San Francisco, Stockton, San Diego, Santa Rosa and San Jose.

At a news conference before the closed-session meetings, various speakers
briefly addressed gang violence in their cities.

Barry Krisberg, president of the National Council on Crime and Delinquency, said
the similarities in gang violence run across the board. He cited side effects of
gang activity - including graffiti, increasing numbers of deaths among young
people and drug-related crimes. In addition, depending on the city, overall
crime rate and homicides have increased from 6 percent to 8 percent, he said.

"The gang problem is not a one-size-fits-all problem," he said. "It's up to each
community to figure out what works best."

So far, San Bernardino has seen a decrease in gang activity largely because of
Operation Phoenix, Mayor Pat Morris' anti-crime initiative. The project, which
kicked off in June, focuses on prevention, suppression and intervention in a
20-block, crime-ridden area northeast of downtown.

"It was the worst area, but we were able reduce crime (there) by 30 percent,"
Martinez said.

Citywide, crime has declined about 15 percent compared to last year.

Dealing with the transitional gangs that set up shop to sell drugs and
generational Latino-gang activity remains one of the city's toughest challenges,
officials said.

After attending some of the network meetings, Kurt Wilson, San Bernardino's
director of community safety and violence prevention, said he is confident the
city is "moving in the right direction" with its progress on gang violence.

"Although we are much smaller than most of the cities who are a part of the
network, this issue is at the forefront for us," he said. "Being able to
collaborate with other cities gives us an incredible advantage."

CITY SLAY RATE ON PACE TO POST A 30-YEAR LOW

BYLINE: By JOHN MARZULLI

SECTION: News; Pg.  10

LENGTH: 285 words


The city's murder rate for the first six months of the year ranked 71st of 195
cities nationwide with a population of at least 100,000, according to statistics
released yesterday by the police department.

With the murder rate dropping, the city is on a pace to log the fewest killings
in 30 years, officials said.

There were 5.1 murders per 100,000 people in New York City from January through
June compared with 35.6 in Richmond, Va. (No. 1); 28.5 in Washington, D.C. (No.
3); and 7.7 in Los Angeles (No. 37).

The rankings were prepared by NYPD analysts based on preliminary crime
statistics released by the FBI.

Through Sunday, there have been 686 murders in the city compared with 884 for
the same period last year, a 22.3% decrease.

At the current pace, the city would come in with about 760 murders the fewest
since 1967, when there were 745. Last year, the city logged 984 murders.

According to the FBI statistics, New York City was 150th of 189 cities in the
major crime rate just behind Boise, Idaho. The city's crime rate fell 10% in the
first six months of 1997, while the nation's rate dropped by only 4%.

The safest city in the state based on per-capita crime is the town of Amherst, a
Buffalo suburb with a population of 107,331. Amherst is ranked 186th of 189
cities in major crime and has been murder-free so far this year.

Assistant Police Chief Frank Olesko said Amherst has no plans to copy New York
City's vaunted quality of life crackdown to reduce crime even further.

"We've got one guy who wanders around picking up cans, and he's the only
homeless guy we have," Olesko said. "The people here kind of take care of him,
so we're going to keep him around."

Crime Rate In U.S. Falls To 10-Year Low; Capital-Area Statistics Show Mixed
Picture

Pierre Thomas, Washington Post Staff Writer

SECTION: A SECTION; Pg. A01

LENGTH: 779 words


The nation's crime rate fell to the lowest level in a decade, the FBI reported
today in its yearly survey of law enforcement agencies, with the rate of violent
crime in 1995 dropping 4 percent from the previous year.

The reduction in violent crime was fueled by a fairly dramatic 8 percent
decrease in the rate of murders, along with a smaller decline in rapes,
robberies and aggravated assaults. Overall, 21,597 murders were recorded in
1995, 13 percent fewer than in 1991. The rate of property crime fell by 1
percent to 12 million offenses, the lowest number since 1987.

Attorney General Janet Reno and other law enforcement experts attributed the
continuing drop in crime to a variety of factors, including maturing and
consequently less violent crack cocaine markets, sharp increases in the number
of police officers on the streets, improved coordination among federal, state
and local authorities, and more prisons to house violent offenders.

The survey, known as the FBI Uniform Crime Report, was compiled from crimes
reported to more than 16,000 law enforcement agencies covering 95 percent of the
nation's population. Preliminary figures, documenting the drop in serious crime,
were released in May.

Release of the new numbers comes as the presidential race heads into its final
leg, and the report was quickly embraced by President Clinton as evidence that
efforts to combat violence are working.

Clinton has come under attack by his Republican opponent, Robert J. Dole, for
not doing enough about crime.

"All Americans can be pleased with today's report that our nation's crime rate
is at a 10-year low," Clinton said in a statement released yesterday by the
White House. "Our anti-crime strategy -- to put more police on the street while
working to get drugs, gangs and guns out of our neighborhoods -- is working."

While lauding the numbers, Reno and others who follow law enforcement were
reluctant to suggest that the country has resolved its crime woes, which
continues to rank in public opinion polls as a chief concern for citizens,
particularly for those in areas that have not seen dramatic declines in crime.

For example, regionally, the portrait of serious crime is was somewhat muddled.
Maryland saw both the number of violent and property crimes increase in 1995
compared to the previous year. In Virginia, violent crime increased, while
property crime dipped slightly.

The District saw violent crime decrease by 3 percent, but property crime jump by
nearly 10 percent.

Nationally, every region of the country except the West showed drops from 1994
crime levels, with each category of serious crime showing modest declines.

The lowest level of crime was reported in the Northeast.

Reno said that while there had been improvement in many areas, juvenile crime
rose, and remained a prime concern. In fact, the one crime category that showed
a slight increase was larceny, an offense often associated with juveniles.

"The larceny increase could be an early warning signal that more young people
are coming of crime-committing age," said Alfred Blumstein, a criminologist at
Carnegie Mellon University.

Law enforcement experts predict the rapid growth in the number of juvenile
offenders, which only recently stabilized, could become worse with a surge in
the teenage and young adult population in the next decade.

"We are hopeful that the declining numbers represent the beginning of a trend,
but we remain concerned over the prospect of an increase in juvenile crime in
the next six to seven years," said James Pasco, executive director of the
National Fraternal Order of Police.

While the crime rate numbers were generally heartening, a closer look reveals
why many Americans remain anxious.

For example, although the 1.79 million violent crimes reported in 1995 resulted
in the lowest rate since 1989, that rate was still 21 percent higher than a
decade ago.

Also, the number of people murdered by strangers continued to grow.

More than half, or 55 percent of murder victims, were killed by strangers or
persons unknown, compared with less than half in 1990.

The recent decline is "good news, but it's far too early to celebrate," said
James A. Fox, dean of the college of criminal justice at Northeastern
University.

"We are not winning the war against crime," Fox said. "One of the reasons the
crime rate is so far down is because it went so high" in the late 1980s and
early 1990s when the nation struggled to cope with the explosion of crack
cocaine and its accompanying violence. "The peak is now coming down to a more
normal level."

ACOG: City will be safe despite No. 1 violent crime rate

BYLINE: Virginia Anderson and R. Robin McDonald; STAFF WRITERS

SECTION: LOCAL OLYMPICS; Pg. 01A

LENGTH: 459 words


Atlanta will be the safest city in the world during the Olympics, even if its
violent crime rate is the worst in the nation, ACOG and state officials say.

While lamenting that the city ranks first in violent crime based on FBI
statistics, A.D. Frazier of the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games said
Sunday that it's not fair to judge the safety of Atlanta during the Olympics by
the recent statistics.

"This is not representative of a lack of preparation for the Olympic Games,"
Frazier said, stressing that the city has worked for five years to prepare a
security plan for the Games. "If people who come here will follow instructions,
I think they'll be in the most secure place on Earth."

While violent and property crime fell 2 percent in the nation as a whole during
1995, Atlanta's crime rate rose 5 percent, making it the crime leader, with more
crimes per person than any other city with a population of 250,000 or more,
according to an analysis of FBI statistics released Sunday.

Mayor Bill Campbell said Sunday that he was "dismayed" by the numbers. "We
simply must do more and will," he said. "The efforts to make Atlanta a safer
city will intensify no matter what the statistics show.

We will never rest until Atlanta is a safer city."

Police Chief Beverly Harvard would not comment on the statistics, saying she has
a policy of not debating numbers.

An Atlanta Journal-Constitution analysis of the new FBI crime statistics shows
that in 1995, despite 186 homicides, the lowest number in a decade, Atlanta
reclaimed its dubious reputation as the most violent city in the country,
outranking similar-sized cities such as Miami, St. Louis, Baltimore and Tampa.

In a Friday meeting with 100 Atlanta business executives, Bill Rathburn, ACOG's
security director, said street crime in Los Angeles went down during the 1984
Games there because so many police officers were on the streets.

"We have less crime at the Olympics than we do at college football games or
professional football games," he said.

Attorney General Mike Bowers, who recently angered local law enforcement
officials by saying that Sarajevo, Bosnia, was safer than some areas of Atlanta,
agreed that the city's streets will be safe during the Games.

"There will be a massive effort to protect our visitors," Bowers said. "They're
gonna be looked after pretty carefully."

In Atlanta there will be more than 25,000 federal, state and local law
enforcement officers and military personnel assigned to security.

Sophisticated computer programs that will monitor access points at all venues

California convenes summit on crime

DATELINE: HOLLYWOOD, Calif.


When a teen-ager was fatally shot on campus last year, students at suburban
Reseda High School in Los Angeles began touring elementary schools with an
anti-weapons message.

Worried about growing school violence, parents at one Sacramento high school
volunteered to patrol the campus, nearly eliminating fights and assaults that
had plagued the school for years.

These were among the success stories praised Monday during the first day of a
high-profile crime summit organized by California Gov. Pete Wilson to help find
ways to reduce crime and violence.

The session, scheduled two weeks ago but postponed because of the devastating
Northridge earthquake, concludes today with discussions on issues such as street
crime, the effect of crime on business and the role of punishment.

"As southern California shakes off the fear of earthquakes and aftershocks, it
finds itself face to face . . . with the fear of violent crime," the Republican
governor told 300 victims, experts and legislators.

Critics said the summit is designed to boost Wilson's re-election campaign,
capitalizing on polls showing crime is at the top of voters' concerns. They
noted that the state's overall crime rate actually decreased slightly last year,
and that an unprecedented series of tough law-and-order bills - including a
"three strikes and you're out" measure backed by the governor - is speeding
through the state Legislature.

"I think it's a lot of political posturing," says James McWilliams, chief public
defender in Alameda County and president of the California Public Defenders
Association.

Marc Klaas, father of kidnap-murder victim Polly Klaas, said, "It's looking more
and more like it's a very skewed kind of a conference, that the only issues that
are being put forth are the issues on the governor's crime agenda."

But Wilson and his supporters say violent crime in California has risen 19% in
the past five years, driven largely by a 63.7% increase in violent crime
committed by juveniles in the same time period.

At the panel discussion Monday, Reseda High School junior Iman Dakhil said:
"School violence is all around us. No one can escape it. The only way to deal
with it is for everyone to band together to fight it."

Said Rudy Castruita, superintendent of the Santa Ana Unified School District in
Orange County: "We as a society have to inject some hope and optimism in our
young people. That's all we really can give our kids today, the ability to hope
and dream."

Police alone can't stop crime in streets

BYLINE: Sandra G. del Villar; Sam Vincent Meddis

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 9A

LENGTH: 580 words


Reuben Greenberg, 46, has been chief of police in Charleston, S.C., for nine
years. Greenberg has been in law enforcement since 1967, working in Savannah,
Ga.; Orlando, Fla.; Tallahassee, Fla.; San Francisco; Mobile, Ala.; and Miami.
Greenberg gave his views in a recent interview with USA TODAY's Sandra G. del
Villar and in an earlier one with Sam Vincent Meddis.

Q: You've brought down the crime rate in your city. How?

A: One of the things is that we oppose the probation or parole of all burglars,
all armed robbers, all rapists, every one of them. We let them serve out their
terms to the last year. We go every week to the state capital to oppose the
parole - in many cases taking the victim with us - to say to the parole board,
''Please don't release them into our community.''

Q: Are drugs a major cause of violent crime?

A: We had crime in this country when drugs were a relatively minor problem.
We've had dealers fighting over turf and all that - St. Valentine's Day
massacre. When I was growing up, we were told to stay away from places where
(criminal types hung out. Now, I defy anyone to show me a photograph of a
typical drug dealer. They're around the board rooms, they're journalists, police
officers, carpenters, they're everywhere.

Q: Why is crime increasing?

A: Because we've given up. Everybody wants to talk about legalizing drugs,
legalizing other types of crimes, that we don't have a problem, that we've
failed, that we can't engage in social engineering.

Q: You have very definite views about blacks committing crimes against one
another. What can be done?

A: There's got to be a social order. The way you maintain social order is not
jails, courts or prisons. It's on the basis of conscience, embarrassment and
shame - internal controls. They should not be talked to. They should be given
the cold shoulder, not put in separate areas, because then you reinforce the
problem.

Q: So you're talking about changing social habits?

A: We've got to look at criminals as the lowdown SOBs that they are. It's got to
be understood, got to be the theme in every black community, church, social and
fraternal organization, that black-on-black crime is against their own
interests. The solution is not to get involved with anyone who gets involved
with violence.

Q: Why would ostracism be effective when so many other methods haven't worked?

A: They're just like anyone else - they want approval from their peers. They
know what the rules are, but they just exempt themselves from them.

Q: Can't the police help?

A: Police are not going to be successful. In case of homicide, police are
effective - if you want to call it effective - after someone is killed or
assaulted. The exception is domestic violence. The drive-by killings, the
drug-related killings, we make excuses for this kind of activity. The solution
is not going to be this ''40 acres and a mule'' position that's so popular with
liberals. We've got a very serious problem and a large proportion of it is
black-on-black crime. The way you maintain order in a democracy is not through
the police or the courts, it's through social order.

Q: Then why can't crime in black areas be controlled through the social order?

A: But we don't have that, unfortunately. All we have is excuse making, people
saying that it's the schools' fault, parents' fault, government's fault. It's
always somebody else's fault. But we have to take responsibility.

Drug dealer search nabs murder suspect

Local police looking for a possible drug dealer unwittingly found a man wanted
for homicide.

The Columbia County Sheriff's Department asked the Portage Police Department to
approach an 18-year-old Las Vegas man to see if he was a suspect in a drug case,
said Detective Sgt. Jay Yerges.

As soon as the officers ran the man's name through their system, they discovered
there was a warrant for his arrest out of Nevada for homicide, Yerges said.

The man was arrested Thursday and is being held in the county jail pending
extradition. Later that afternoon, police located the man they'd originally
thought was the suspect in the drug case. A 33-year-old man was arrested and
accused of possessing and dealing cocaine.

Madison top city in hate-crime reporting

Madison topped the list of cities with reported hate crimes in the state last
year, but that could be misleading because different cities have different
reporting systems, a state official says.

There were 16 reported hate crimes in Madison last year, according to Tom
Eversen, manager of the state crime reporting program.

Sheboygan was second in the state with five hate crimes, followed by Wausau with
four. Both communities have large populations of Hmong residents.

The hate crime statistics may raise more questions than answers, since there is
no uniform method for reporting hate crimes, Eversen said.

"It's hard to say what that means. It may mean Madison does a better job at
looking at them," Eversen said.

Some of the state's largest communities reported no hate crimes in 2000, while
much smaller communities like Hayward or Siren each reported at least one of the
state's 47 reported hate crimes.

Milwaukee, Racine, Green Bay, Appleton and Janesville did not report any hate
crimes in 2000. Last year's statistics did not vary greatly from the number of
annual hate crimes over the past 10 years, Eversen said.

Since 1996, both Madison and Sheboygan have been in the top two in the number of
hate crimes reported in the state since 1996.

Madison police spokesman Larry Kamholz said the department is trying to educate
the public about hate crimes. "We're trying to get across the point that it's OK
to report it," he said.

CHANHASSEN

Driver, 17, dies in crash trying to evade police

A 17-year-old driver was killed Friday night in a Chanhassen car crash after he
sped away from police who had pulled him over.

According to the Carver County Sheriff's Office, about 11 p.m. a South Lake
Minnetonka police officer pulled over a car with three teens in it at the
intersection of Minnesota highways 7 and 41. As the officer approached the car,
however, the driver sped away heading south on Minnesota 41, according to Carver
County Sheriff's Office reports.

Within minutes, the car collided with another car at the intersection of
Minnesota 5. The second car was attempting to turn west onto Minnesota 5 from
41.

The driver was pronounced dead at the scene. Two other male teen-agers, ages 16
and 17, were taken to Hennepin County Medical Center with injuries. The
30-year-old driver of the second vehicle was taken to Ridgeview Medical Center.
Their conditions were not available Saturday.

Police withheld their names until their relatives could be notified of the
accident.

MINNEAPOLIS

Elderly man found dead outside home

Minneapolis police were investigating Saturday the suspicious death of an
elderly man found outside a home in the southern part of the city.

Police found the man dead in front of 3141 29th Ave. S. The death seemed
suspicious, but police would not elaborate on why. The Minneapolis police
Homicide Unit was investigating the death as a possible homicide. Hennepin
County medical examiners did not release the man's name Saturday because they
hadn't yet found his family.

MURDER RATE HITS 33-YR. LOW

BYLINE: By SCOTT SHIFREL DAILY NEWS STAFF WRITER

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 8

LENGTH: 373 words

Lyndon Johnson was President and the Beatles were still together the last time
the U.S. murder rate dipped as low as it did last year, according to an FBI
report released yesterday.

But while the national homicide rate was the lowest in 33 years, the number of
murders in New York City actually went up from 633 in 1998 to 671 in 1999,
statistics showed.

And criminologists said the trend is likely to continue in New York - and other
big cities across the country.

"The big cities are reaching their limit" in crime reduction, said Prof. James
Alan Fox of Northeastern University in Boston.

Alfred Blumstein of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh said big cities are
the best barometers of how well the war against crime is going.

"The big cities were the first to go up in the 1980s, the first to come down in
the 1990s," he said. "Now, having the lowest murder rate decline suggests
they'll be the first to stabilize. Murders and crime can't go down forever."

The latest FBI report suggests the decline in the number of murders was already
slowing down.

Although the murder rate across the nation was the lowest since 1966 - 5.7 per
100,000 in 1999 - big cities with more than 1 million residents only saw a 4%
drop, to 13 per 100,000.

Nationally, last year marked the eighth straight year that serious crime
dropped, including rapes, robberies and assaults.

The statistics closely matched those in New York City, where serious crime in
1999 was down 8.4% from 1998, according to New York Police Department
statistics.

As of Oct. 8, serious crime in the city was down 5.34% this year, the
department's numbers show.

The newest FBI statistics also revealed:

* A 7% drop of serious crimes from 1998.

* Violent crime, at 525 murders, rapes, robberies and assaults for every 100,000
residents, was at a 21-year low.

The last time violent crimes were lower - 498 in 1978 - came well before an
epidemic of crack cocaine sent rates soaring in the mid-1980s.

Statewide, New York also saw decreases in crime, with a 9% decline between 1998
and 1999 in the number of "index crimes," which include serious crimes such as
murder and rape as well as nonviolent crimes like burglary.

Murders in the state declined 2.4%.

Whitman Heralds a Record 9% Drop in Crime in New Jersey

BYLINE: AP

LENGTH: 679 words

DATELINE: WEST WINDSOR, N.J., Aug. 31


New Jersey's crime rate decreased by a record margin in 1998, prompting Gov.
Christine Todd Whitman to trumpet the news today with a marching band in a high
school gym.

With West Windsor-Plainsboro High School students sitting in bleachers behind
her and a band playing, Mrs. Whitman said that the crime rate dropped 9 percent
last year, the biggest one-year decrease since the state began collecting crime
data in a uniform way in 1966.

The Uniform Crime Report also showed that violent crime dropped by 10 percent in
1998 and that crime dropped in every major category.

"I am very pleased to release a report that shows New Jersey is becoming an even
safer place to work, live, and raise a family," Mrs. Whitman said.

Not every aspect of the report, however, was a cause for celebration. New
Jersey's murder rate, for example, dropped at a much lower rate than those of
the nation as a whole and of the Northeast, largely because of an increase in
murders tied to domestic violence. Reports of bias crimes also were up.

Mrs. Whitman said she released the report at a high school because shootings at
schools around the country, including Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.,
"are a reminder that crime can happen anywhere, and we must always be on our
guard." The Governor said efforts to curb youth crime in the state have been
successful, with juvenile arrests having dropped 14 percent.

Attorney General John F. Farmer Jr. used the event to discuss school safety and
the uproar over the state police's stopping drivers because of their race. "I
don't want people to believe that every trooper is a bigot," Mr. Farmer told
students. "It's simply not true."

He also said that while the school shootings should prompt vigilance, "Let's not
turn our schools into armed camps."

The Uniform Crime Report shows a crime was committed every minute and 46 seconds
in New Jersey last year.

There were 35,722 violent crimes -- murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault
-- reported in New Jersey, down 10 percent from 1997. Murder was down 4 percent
to 321, rape decreased 6 percent to 1,623, robbery dropped 11 percent to 15,115,
and aggravated assault declined 10 percent to 18,663.

Property crime -- burglary, theft, and auto theft -- dropped 9 percent. Crime
was down in every county except Cape May and Hunterdon.

Mrs. Whitman said the statistics show her administration's law enforcement
efforts are working. She also said that a better economy has produced more jobs
and helped reduce crime.

But economic and crime statistics mirror national trends. New Jersey's 9 percent
reduction in crime was slightly better than the nation's 7 percent drop. In the
Northeast, covering New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and the New England
states, crime dropped 8 percent. New Jersey's 10 percent reduction in violent
crime was better than the 7 percent decline recorded in the Northeast and the
nation.

However, the state's 4 percent reduction in murders was only half the 8 percent
national decline. Mr. Farmer attributed this to a 24 percent increase in murders
that were the result of domestic violence.

The report also showed 877 bias incidents, up 9 percent from 1997.

The crime statistics have been known for a while, but the report was not
released until today -- by far the latest during Mrs. Whitman's two terms. She
has released the report as early as July 25.

Mr. Farmer said there was a delay because he was concerned about how the report
used race to profile the typical person arrested in a specific crime. With
disputes about racial profiling surrounding the state police, Mr. Farmer sought
to change the way the statistics were presented.

Mr. Farmer said that when the numbers are close -- 51 percent of those arrested
for a crime are from one race, while 49 percent are from another -- "to say that
the typical offender is of either race, to me, is meaningless and misleading."

The report continues to give the race of the "most frequent offenders" -- even
when one race accounts for 50 percent. But now it also lists percentages.

What police statistics mean - numbers don't tell whole story

BYLINE: R. Robin McDonald; STAFF WRITER

SECTION: LOCAL NEWS; Pg. 01E

LENGTH: 306 words


Although the FBI's national crime statistics, collected from police across the
country, are used by academics, the news media, and law enforcement agencies to
gauge crime levels across the country, the bureau itself doesn't rank cities by
crime rate.

Such rankings, FBI officials argue, are "simplistic" and "often create
misleading perceptions" because they don't include tourists, students and
transient workers in the computations.

"The policing population is different from the resident population,"said FBI
statistician Vicky Major.

The statistics are released twice each year. The first report includes
preliminary crime numbers for the 100 largest cities in the country. The second
report, released at the end of the year, includes final crime numbers for all
cities and states.

Crime rates alone "are insufficient to understand the true picture of crime, "
said Robert Friedmann, head of Georgia State University's criminal justice
department.

"If you go to a small town, with a population of 125 and have a family of four
slain," he said, "suddenly that little town becomes the murder capital of the
U.S.A."

In fact, in 1995, the Oklahoma City bombing vaulted that community into fifth
place among the nation's deadliest cities.

Nor do the FBI statistics - based on police reports - account for all crime,
counting only homicide, rape (of females only), robbery, aggravated assault,
burglary, larceny and auto theft.

"If a police department works harder and turns up more crime, you actually have
a higher crime rate," said Bart Lewis, chief statistician at the Atlanta
Regional Commission.

By contrast, Friedmann said, crime in New York City has fallen off sharply in
the past year because "the attitude is, if you don't see blood splattering on
pavement, you don't report an aggravated assault."

Crime Rises 4 Percent, Arundel Police Report; Violent Offenses Decrease by 1.2
Percent

Amy Argetsinger, Washington Post Staff Writer

SECTION: WEEKLY - MARYLAND; Pg. M01

LENGTH: 362 words


Crime in Anne Arundel County increased by about 4 percent last year, according
to new police statistics, although the number of the most violent crimes
actually decreased slightly.

Within Annapolis, crime rose 3 percent, according to city police. Violent
crimes, such as homicide and rape, declined slightly, but incidents of burglary
and larceny both rose.

County and Annapolis police said they saw the most notable increases in robbery
-- particularly gas station and convenience store holdups -- and theft,
especially of valuables taken from cars.

The number of robberies in the county increased 12.7 percent last year. Police
said most robberies of gas stations and stores take place along major
thoroughfares. Detectives also speculate that Anne Arundel is drawing more
robberies because its proximity to Washington and Baltimore offers easy escape
to surrounding jurisdictions.

County police handled 16 homicides in 1995, up from 11 the year before. In 12 of
last year's homicide cases, police quickly made an arrest, though four others
still are being investigated.

Overall, however, the number of violent crimes -- which includes homicide, rape,
robbery and aggravated assault -- declined 1.2 percent.

There were 86 reported incidents of rape in the county in 1995, down from 112
the year before. The number of aggravated assaults also decreased 7 percent, to
837 from 899.

Meanwhile the number of property crimes -- including breaking and entering,
theft and auto theft -- increased in Anne Arundel by more than 4 percent in 1995
compared with the year before.

The number of incidents of breaking and entering declined slightly from the year
before, following long-term trends across the state.

Theft increased 6.7 percent across the county -- 12,054 incidents in 1995, as
opposed to 11,292 the year before -- mostly due to more auto parts and bicycle
thefts. In Annapolis, theft increased 5 percent, with more people stealing
purses and briefcases from out-of-town cars parked in the downtown tourist
district, police said.

County police said breaking and entering decreased 4.8 percent, to 2,985 in 1995
from 3,137 in 1994.

Citizens are fighting back / 'Enough is enough' in Miami, where watch groups are
reducing fear

BYLINE: Deborah Sharp

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 7A

LENGTH: 376 words

DATELINE: MIAMI


Given this city's image - awash in guns, flooded by crime - it's no wonder the
nation thinks Miamians have pulled the shades and given up hope.

Some have, but others refuse to surrender. In a trend echoed in cities across
the USA, Miamians are fighting back with new twists on a 20-year-old idea:
Neighborhood crime prevention.

"More and more people are saying, 'Enough is enough. What do we have to do?' "
says Miami police Lt. Bill Schwartz.

The programs here and elsewhere can be as simple as a street sign helping to
reassure neighbors, to patrols of residents, walkie-talkie networks and close
neighborhood-police cooperation.

"We don't always get along on everything in Miami, but on crime we all agree,"
says crime-watch council chairman Joe Wilkins, 43, a Miami native. "We're just
trying to keep our neighborhoods from going down the tubes."

Nationwide, Neighborhood Watch-kit requests jumped by hundreds in 1993, says
Betsy Cantrell of the National Sheriffs' Association.

Overall, 25 million Americans live in a variety of crime-watch communities - a
jump from 19 million in 1987.

Results are arguable: Crime rates are down in Miami, but a watch group member
was fatally shot this month during a burglary in Miami's Little Haiti.

Still, police say such efforts can reduce the fear of crime, often more
crippling than the crime rate itself. A recent Justice Department survey of
Neighborhood Watch participants found 72% believed crime was lowered.

Says Jean O'Neil of the National Crime Prevention Council: "The most effective
programs have gone beyond sitting and watching out the window, to taking on the
problems of the neighborhoods."

In Miami, the crime council tackles everything from garbage in the streets to
kids with too much time on their hands. There's even an effort under way to
track lenient sentences given out by judges.

Experts offer these community crime-fighting tips:

Check with local police to see if a group already exists.

Canvass door-to-door to recruit members.

Gather facts: police reports, victim surveys, residents' perceptions. Accurate
information can reduce fear.

CONFERENCE WARNS OF ORGANIZED CRIME

BYLINE: By BEN A. FRANKLIN, Special to the New York Times

SECTION: Section A; Page 16, Column 1; National Desk

LENGTH: 666 words

DATELINE: HARRISBURG, Pa., Sept. 10


Organized crime ''is bullish on America,'' law-enforcement officers and
legislators warned today at the end of a two-day meeting here designed to end
public and judicial skepticism about increasing underworld influence in the
lives of ordinary citizens and of the police and courts.

''To the average person, organized crime is some funny-sounding foreign name,
heard on television,'' said Arthur Shuman, chief assistant district attorney of
Philadelphia. ''You go before judges and speak of the Mafia and they say, 'Don't
make me laugh.' ''

''Well, I am telling you that there are reports that the 10 million metric tons
of heroin that came illegally into this country last year may go to 60 million
tons this year, and a lot of it will come into Philadelphia. It does not bode
well for Philadelphia or Pennsylvania.''

''One of our major problems is the lack of consciousness of organized crime,''
said Alvin B. Lewis Jr., chairman of the Pennsylvania Crime Commission, the
statewide investigating agency that staged the session here before a joint
meeting of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees of the Pennsylvania
Legislature.

Complaceny Said to Aid Crime

''It needs complacency to survive,'' Mr. Lewis said at a final news conference
this afternoon. ''It has got it.'' The Crime Commission today published a
290-page study titled ''A Decade of Organized Crime'' that names 97 members of
Pennsylvaniabased Mafia groups and 14 other Mafia operators from New York and
New Jersey that were described as ''active in Pennsylvania.''

The names include the Russell Bufalino ''family,'' the Angelo Brunos, the Tony
Grossos and the John LaRoccas. The report said that Mr. Bufalino, 76 years old,
of Kingston, Pa., had taken control of the Magaddino and Genovese ''families,''
the latter based in New York.

The study also catalogues 213 Pennsylvania cities and towns and 187 cities in 33
other states with ''criminal connections'' to Pennsylvania. Many of the
Pennsylvania towns are in rural areas because, the report says, county and
small-town law-enforcement agencies cannot deal with ''sophisticated''
syndicated crime. New York City ranks third, after Philadelphia and Pittsburgh,
in the report's list of ''most-often-mentioned cities'' with criminal
connections.

Public Awareness Is Goal

The intent of the meeting was to heighten public awareness of what witnesses
before the Crime Commission insisted was a rapidly rising threat of criminal
violence and theft.

''Organized crime is sophisticated, monolithic and expansive,'' said Mr. Lewis,
the commission chairman. ''It cannot flourish without official complicity. Yet
what is Government's response? It is complacency, competition among agencies,
confusion and corruption.''

Beyond reciting the history of bribes to police officials and judges in
Pennsylvania by underworld figures, and calling for a renewed alert against
official corruption, the two days of testimony here stressed two new defenses.

One was the developing trend of cooperation, often by using computers, among
Federal and state enforcement agencies to curb underworld activities that cross
jurisdictional lines.

Use of Civil Regulatory Agencies

The other was a turn to civil regulatory agencies, used recently in New York to
thwart a monopoly on pizza cheese controlled by organized crime, by denying
civil permits and licenses to ''legitimate'' businesses run by the underworld.
The report said that these were often fronts for more blatantly racketeering
activities used to conceal income, ''launder'' money and provide a way to avoid
taxes.

Mr. Lewis told a news conference this afternoon that the Crime Commission would
begin tomorrow requiring Pennsylvania's business regulatory agencies to draw up
plans for detecting known criminals in reviewing applications for civil
licenses. He said the commission can do so under its existing powers.

The report is available from the Pennsylvania Crime Commission, Box 45, St.
Davids Pa. 19087.

10 safest communities in U.S. to raise a family

BYLINE: Michael Call For the Deseret News

LENGTH: 782 words


Although most communities and states throughout the country have adopted the
FBI's standard crime reporting systems, finding a community that is sufficiently
safe for your family can still present problems because crimes come in so many
types and circumstances. Even categorizing crime into the groupings of violent
crime and property crime can present some difficulties: Is burglary more serious
than auto theft? Is aggravated assault worse than robbery? Clearly, any crime is
bad, but some types of crime seem to be worse than others when choosing a place
to raise a family.

Civicus Consulting Group has taken all the crime data available for each of the
361 Census Bureau-defined Metropolitan Statistical Areas and applied its own
subjective weighting to each of these types of crime to come up with its own
ratings and rankings. Based on that criteria, here are the 10 safest communities
for you to raise your family: 1. Logan ?Home to Utah State University, this once
primarily agricultural community has rapidly developed into an education,
high-tech, and manufacturing center of nearly 125,000 residents. With a violent
crime rate of one-sixth the national rate-and property crime rates less than
one-half the national average, Logan is the safest of the metropolitan areas in
our study. 2. State College, Pa. ? Another college town, State College is home
to Penn State University and for educational opportunities alone could rate high
on anyone's list of favorite places to raise a family. Its low overall crime
rates put it second on our list. Of particular note is the infrequency of murder
and other violent crimes. In fact, many years there are no murders at all. 3.
Harrisonburg, Va. ?This metro area in north-central Virginia is only a two-hour
drive to Washington, D.C., and yet it is virtually on the foothills of George
Washington National Forest. The most common crime in Harrisonburg is theft, and
even at that the theft rate is less than half the national average-about 1,129
per 100,000 residents. 4. Eau Claire, Wis. ?The greater Eau Claire area, located
about 80 miles east of the Twin Cities, is full of outdoor recreation, arts,
culture, and educational opportunities. Maybe that's partly why it ranks so high
on our list of safest communities. Violent crime in Eau Clair is only one-fourth
the national average, and some types of property crime are one-half to one-third
the national average. 5. Provo-Orem ? With more than half a million residents
and located about 50 miles south of the state capital of Salt Lake City, Provo
and its sister city Orem have experienced tremendous population and job growth
over the past 20 years. Yet crime is still low enough to be nearly at a
small-town level. Well below national averages in all crime categories,
Provo-Orem is clean and safe-making it an ideal home for most families. 6. Glens
Falls, N.Y. ? Found north of New York City, Glens Falls has nearly 130,000
residents. While high on arts, culture, performing arts, museums, and outdoor
activities, Glens Falls is low on crime. Vehicular theft and robbery rates are
nearly one-tenth the national rates. 7. Holland, Mich. ? The Holland-Grand Haven
metro area in western Michigan is found on the picturesque Lake Michigan and was
settled by Dutch immigrants. Holland continues to boast of its religious
heritage and the impact of it. Certainly low crime is one of those effects.
Property crime is one-half the national average, and violent crime is about
one-third of that found throughout the country. 8. Williamsport, Pa. ? Located
100 miles north of Harrisburg, Williamsport was founded on the banks of the
beautiful Susquehanna River and has a lot going for it-including low crime
rates. 9. Ithaca, N.Y. ? Ithaca, the home of Cornell University, is in the
central New York area where you'll find beautiful parks, cool streams and
rivers, and friendly people, but you won't find high crime. Crime rates in
Ithaca are less than half the national averages in all categories. 10. Appleton,
Wis. ? Appleton is near Lake Winnebago, the city of Oshkosh, and only a stone's
throw away from Green Bay. Those who have visited Appleton speak of the
beautiful foliage, abundant arts and culture, and plentiful opportunities for
outdoor recreation. But they usually don't speak of Appleton's crime, which,
like the other nine communities on our list, is rarely seen. Michael Call, of
Civicus Consulting Group and author of "Best Places to Raise an LDS Family," has

years. He is currently a Ph.D. candidate at Indiana Tech. Leave your own

Murders and other violence drop in L.A.;
'It's due to us, the police,' chief says

BYLINE: William M. Welch

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 440 words


LOS ANGELES -- This city known for its gangs and violence has been catching a
break lately: murders, property crimes and other violence are down significantly
despite the recession.

The number of murders in Los Angeles fell by nearly a third in the first three
months of this year compared with the same period in 2008, according to police
department statistics. The 70 people killed in the first quarter of 2009 compare
with 101 homicides in the first quarter of last year.

Total violent crimes were down nearly 5%, the LAPD figures show. Overall
property crimes were down, too.

Police Chief William Bratton says some expected crime to go up during hard
economic times, and Southern California has been in a recession longer than most
of the rest of the country.

"We're not experiencing any increase in crime having to do with the economy, nor
do I expect we will," he said.

The declines accelerate a more-than-six-year downward trend in Los Angeles,
according to the city's crime statistics. Bratton credits the decrease to his
management staff and police officers.

"It's due to us, the police," Bratton said in an interview with USA TODAY. "Very
specifically, how we police."

Under Bratton, the former New York City police chief, the LAPD keeps
up-to-the-minute statistics on every crime or shooting reported. The force
redeploys officers to crime hot spots daily and weekly based on the data.

The department has been helping provide re-entry assistance for gang members out
of prison.

Connie Rice, a civil rights lawyer who advises Bratton, credits "much smarter
policing" for the drop. She said a variety of other factors may be at work,
including court injunctions and enforcement actions that have driven gang
leaders out of the city.

"We've exported it all over the country," she said of gang violence.

New York uses a similar crime management system, begun when Bratton was chief
there. It, too, has seen a decline in violent crime. From Jan. 1 through March
29, New York Police Department figures show a 23% decline in murders: 89 this
year compared with 116 in the same period last year. There was a similar
decrease in rape.

Bratton says more cops have helped. Los Angeles increased the number of officers
to 9,855, up from fewer than 9,000 in 2001.

Al Blumstein, director of the National Consortium on Violence Research at
Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, says the declines come as crime rates
have remained generally flat nationwide.

"Big cities are pretty savvy and sophisticated, so if something pops up
somewhere they have the know-how to respond and the resources to do so," he
said. "Smaller cities are pretty much strapped."

YOUTH CRIME PEAKS IN AFTERNOON

BYLINE: ANGIE CANNON, Mercury News Washington Bureau

SECTION: FRONT; Pg. 4A

LENGTH: 546 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON


Violent juvenile crime on school days occurs much more frequently between 2 p.m.
and 8 p.m. than late at night, says a report released Wednesday.

The report, released by "Fight Crime: Invest in Kids," a youth-advocacy group
made up of police chiefs, prosecutors and crime victims, raises questions about
the need for youth curfews, a popular but controversial crime-control measure.
Although many civil rights groups and individuals have challenged the
constitutionality of curfews, about three-fourths of the nation's 200 biggest
cities, including San Jose, have them in place.

Several juvenile-crime bills are pending in Congress and may be taken up this
week.

James Alan Fox, dean of Northeastern University's College of Criminal Justice in
Boston and an author of the report, said: "We've closed down ball fields. We've
closed down community centers. We have disinvested in childhood, and kids
literally have too much time to kill."

While the report says that 45 percent of violent juvenile crimes -- homicides,
rapes, robberies and aggravated assaults -- occur from 2 p.m. to 8 p.m., it
found that 15 percent occur from 11 p.m. to 7 a.m., when curfews typically are
in effect.

San Jose's ordinance, for example, requires children under 16 to be off city
streets by 10 p.m. Older youths, up to 18, have until 11:30 p.m. Enforcement of
San Jose's curfew has taken more than 12,000 youths off city streets since 1995.
The law has no criminal sanctions; violators are given counseling and returned
home.

Curfews hit "the groups that are at risk, the ones most likely to go out and
commit more crimes," said Mike Van Winkle of the California Department of
Justice.

The new study, billed as the most comprehensive on the relation between youth
crime and the time of day, suggests crime mirrors kids' schedules.

The findings were based on eight states: Alabama, Colorado, Iowa, Idaho,
Illinois, North Dakota, South Carolina and Utah.

The study found that violent juvenile crime triples from 3 p.m. to 4 p.m., the
hour immediately after school, compared with the hour before, when school is
still in session. It dips around dinner time, rises slightly, then declines in
the later evening as most parents want their children home for bed.

The report was compiled the National Center on Juvenile Justice and the Office
for Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention.

San Jose and California officials said they did not have similar statistics.

But San Jose police said data suggests the curfew has increased safety: There
has been a 23 percent decrease in the number of juvenile victims of violent
crime during curfew hours and a 40 percent decrease in the number of youths with
gunshot or stab wounds at Columbia San Jose and Valley medical centers.

The city also offers after-school recreation, tutoring and counseling centers,
and gang awareness and drug-intervention programs.

San Jose is also weighing the possibility of starting a daytime curfew that
would mean stiffer penalties for skipping school.

Howard County Seeks to Erase Graffiti, Other Quality-of-Life Crimes

Fern Shen, Washington Post Staff Writer

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B01

LENGTH: 1059 words


Someone had spray-painted the letters "SPC" all over a convenience store in the
suburban Howard County community of Columbia. Big deal. It's the kind of
obnoxious-but-low-level crime that is usually handled in District Court, along
with minor traffic infractions.

But the alleged graffiti writer was linked to other graffiti -- on a high school
scoreboard, highway overpasses, an 18-wheeler. His home was searched. Evidence
was seized. SPC was said to stand for "Satan's Perfect Child." Christopher Falk,
23, of Columbia, was arrested and charged with 16 counts of malicious
destruction. This month, he faces a jury trial in Circuit Court. Why the tough
treatment?

Because the crime is precisely the kind of quality-of-life diminisher targeted
by the "community justice" program, established last year by the state's
attorney's office in Howard County and by an increasing number of prosecutors
nationwide.

Those prosecutors focus on crimes that "really stick in people's craws," said
Sang W. Oh, a prosecutor in the Howard County state's attorney's office.

Such programs have been criticized by defense attorneys as overkill, showy
public relations gestures that divert resources from serious crimes.

"Why don't they concentrate on rapes and murders?" said Falk's attorney, William
Hale, of Silver Spring. "They acted like the Gestapo; they treated him like a
war criminal. It's ridiculous."

But petty crimes are not so easily dismissed by the people victimized by them,
said Oh, one of two assistant state's attorneys assigned to the new Howard
County program.

"I don't know any one of my neighbors who have been raped or murdered, but I
know plenty whose mailboxes got run over, who had sleds stolen from the back
yard or whose cars got hit by kids who were drinking," Oh said.

Modeled after the community policing concept and often referred to as "community
prosecution," the programs place prosecutors in neighborhoods to listen to
residents' complaints about vandalism, threatening behavior, small-time drug
trafficking, petty theft and similar crimes.

"This is how prosecutors will work with communities in the future," said State's
Attorney Marna McLendon (R), who initiated the program on a pilot basis in two
Columbia villages, Harper's Choice and Wilde Lake.

Prosecutors have been logging long hours at neighborhood meetings and in the
schools, because juveniles are involved in many of the crimes they confront.

Similar programs have been established in the District; Chicago; New York;
Kansas City, Mo.; Cambridge, Mass., and many other cities, where residents and
law enforcement officials have struggled to find a more effective way to combat
"nuisance crimes."

"What you're seeing is the prosecutors redefining their roles a little bit, so
that they're not just responsible for responding to crimes, for processing
cases, but more for preventing crime," said Heike Gramcow, director of
management and program development for the American Prosecutors' Research
Institute, the research arm of the National District Attorneys Association.

The prosecutors who run a six-year-old program in Portland, Ore., say the
community has seen results as they closed crack houses and helped neighborhoods
get the speed bumps they wanted.

In Northeast Washington, where U.S. Attorney Eric H. Holder Jr. set up a
community prosecution pilot program last year, cases have run the gamut from
serious crimes, such as murders in particular neighborhoods, to nuisances, such
as abandoned automobiles and rat infestation.

"We're trying to be there for people, but also to give people a sense [of],
'This is your neighborhood; you've got to tell us what's going on,' " said
Brenda Johnson, deputy chief of the District's community prosecution section.

In a neighborhood plagued by youths shooting at each other, prosecutors cracked
down, partly by charging some of the youths but also by bringing in their
mothers for a stern lecture, Johnson said. In another instance, Johnson
recalled, she helped an elderly woman complaining about a trashed-filled lot by
calling up the property owner and lambasting her for her negligence.

"We do a lot of that -- shaming people into doing right," Johnson said.

In the same way, Oh, in Howard County, is looking for a low-key but more
effective way to deal with a knife-carrying homeless man who has been
intimidating shoppers at one of the village centers.

"My first move will be to try and get the liquor store there to stop selling him
liquor. If he doesn't stop, I could get the other merchants there to lean on
him," Oh said. Prosecutors also might also seek addiction services for the man
or get his family involved, Oh said.

Columbia residents came up with a solution themselves in the case of a vacant
lot where people were gathering to drink and deal drugs: They circulated a
petition to have the lot legally designated as "open space," meaning it had to
close at 10 p.m. Oh researched the procedure in the law books and pushed their
proposal through all the necessary agencies. Now police can force people off the
lot after hours and ticket violators.

"Being in the position I was," Oh said, "I could grease the skids."

Oh's efforts in the graffiti case, however, seem overly harsh to Christopher
Falk's relatives, who say the county is making him "a scapegoat."

"They decided to add all the graffiti in Columbia to his case," said Falk's
mother, Geraldine Falk, whose son lives with her. "I don't even know if he did
it or not. But do they really have to go to such an extent for something so
minor? I think they just don't have enough to do."

Oh, however, said his efforts are meant to send "a strong message of
deterrence."

"We want it understood this [graffiti] will not be tolerated," he said. "That's
a sentiment that I got loud and clear from the community."

Ordinarily, such a case would have remained in District Court, Oh said, where an
offender probably would receive a suspended sentence or probation before
judgment, meaning the person would not have a criminal record.

Oh, however, plans to seek sizable restitution and some "more appropriate
punishment."

"The things I'm hearing people talk about are old-fashioned punishments, like
making the person go out and repaint where they'd painted," Oh said. "I like the
sound of that."

Changing Patterns of Crime in Connecticut

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN

SECTION: Section 13CN; Page 12; Column 3; Connecticut Weekly Desk

LENGTH: 197 words


Countering a regional and possibly a national trend, violent crime in
Connecticut rose slightly in 1996, according to projections based on data for
the first nine months of the year. The violent crime rate -- that is, the number
of murders, rapes, robberies and aggravated assaults per 100,000 residents --
increased by l.5 percent last year, although the total since 1990 is down 26
percent.

The increase could be seen not only in some of larger cities -- violent crime
rose 24 percent in Bridgeport and 17 percent in New Haven -- but also in many
suburbs.

Connecticut remains much safer than the nation as a whole. Of the 90 communities
that reported statistics to the State Police, 85 had violent crime rates below
the national average.

Property crime -- burglary, larceny and auto theft -- declined about 7 percent
in Connecticut in 1996, the projections show, for a total decline of 21 percent
since 1990. Only three of the 20 biggest towns -- Fairfield, West Haven and
Milford -- saw property crime increase last year. Connecticut's property crime
rate was 2 percent lower than the national average in 1995, the last year for
national figures.   ANDY NEWMAN

Nevada: Henderson Ranked Among America's 10 Safest Cities

LENGTH: 323  words

DATELINE: Carson City


The City of Henderson, The State of Nevada has issued the following news
release:

Henderson is once again ranked among the Top 10 Safest Cities in America in a
report released by Movoto Real Estate Blog, a website that provides information
and resources to home buyers.

Movoto's ranking is based on data contained in the 2012 FBI Uniform Crime
Report, which compiles statistics from police departments across the country.
The data was condensed into four categories: murders, violent crimes, property
crimes and total crimes.

Movoto then looked at the number of crimes per 100,000 people annually, and
ranked the nation's 100 largest cities in each category, with 1 being the
safest. Those results were weighted so that murder, violent crimes, and property
crimes each comprised 30 percent of the final score and total crimes made up 10
percent.

Movoto noted that "Henderson has all of the benefits of being near the City of
Lights, without all of the drawbacks, like noise, pollution, overcrowdedness,
and crime."

Henderson placed fifth in the Top 10 Safest Cities. Irvine, Calif., was ranked
first followed by Fremont, Calif., Gilbert, Ariz., and Plano, Texas.

"Delivering programs and services that foster a safe community is essential to
achieving our vision to be America's premier community," Mayor Andy Hafen said.
"Our low crime rate demonstrates that our actions and the police department's
hard work are producing tangible results."

Henderson has previously been recognized as one of America's Best Places to Live
by Money magazine in 2012, 2008 and 2006 and was named the Second Safest City in
America by Forbes.

"I am proud that Henderson has again been recognized as a safe city," Police
Chief Patrick Moers said. "This recognition is possible because of the dedicated
employees of the police department, support from our citizens and commitment
from our city leaders."

CITY AMONG SAFEST IN U.S.;
RATING DROPS A BIT, BUT STILL LEADS LOS ANGELES COUNTY

BYLINE: By Carol Rock Staff Writer

SANTA CLARITA - Although its overall ranking slipped from 27th to 36th among the
nation's safest cities, Santa Clarita emerged as the safest city in Los Angeles
County, according to a report compiled by the research firm of Morgan Quitno and
released Monday.

Using data from the 2004 Uniform Crime Report released Oct. 17 by the FBI on the
frequency of six basic felonies - homicide, rape, robbery, assault, burglary and
motor vehicle theft - the 12th annual ``America's Safest (and Most Dangerous)
Cities'' report ranks cities according to the national average.

Among cities with populations larger than 75,000, Santa Clarita ranked 36th out
of 369 with an overall score showing the city nearly 49 percent lower than the
national average. Santa Clarita's population is 171,290.

However, out of the 208 cities with populations between 100,000 and 499,000,
Santa Clarita slipped to 16th from last year's 10th-place ranking.

The city of Santa Clarita has long boasted of its status as one of the nation's
safest cities.

``We have a lower crime rate today than we did 10 years ago,'' city spokeswoman
Gail Ortiz said. ``Despite a 4 percent increase in population, we only had a 1
percent increase in crime. Of course, we'd rather see crime go down, but we have
a proactive law enforcement program and are pleased with holding the increase at
1 percent.''

Among the top 25 safest cities overall, Thousand Oaks ranked No. 4 and Simi
Valley was 22nd. Palmdale was ranked 223rd with 45.13 percent higher than
average crime stats, and Lancaster came in at 261 with a crime rate 69.35
percent over the national average. The most dangerous city in Los Angeles County
was Compton, ranking 355th out of 369.

The safest city in America was determined to be Newton, Mass., which took top
honors in 2004 as well.

``Newton continues to have one of the best records in the nation when it comes
to crime. In 2004, it once again had no murders and had the lowest overall crime
rate among cities of 75,000 and more,'' wrote the researchers, noting that
Newton was followed by Clarkstown, N.Y.; Amherst, N.Y.; Mission Viejo; and Brick
Township, N.J..

``At the opposite end of the crime scale, Camden, N.J., continues its
stranglehold on the dubious honor of the nation's most dangerous city.

Trailing Camden were Detroit; St. Louis, Mo.; Flint, Mich.; and Richmond, Va.

According to information released by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's
Department's Santa Clarita station, there were two homicides, 30 rapes, 112
robberies, 220 assaults, 728 burglaries and 933 grand thefts (which includes
motor vehicle thefts) in 2004.

AMHERST IS DEPOSED AS SAFEST CITY IN U.S.;
TOWN RANKS THIRD AFTER 4-YEAR REIGN

BYLINE: By T.J. Pignataro - NEWS STAFF REPORTER

SECTION: LOCAL; Pg. B1

LENGTH: 357 words


After a four-year reign as "The Safest City in America," the Town of Amherst was
voted out this year.

It now occupies the third spot in the nation's safest cities -- behind Newton,
Mass., and Brick Township, N.J.

The Morgan Quitno Corp., which will officially publish its annual "City Crime
Rankings" book next month, bases its rankings on the FBI's uniform crime
statistics report for the year. It compares 350 municipalities with populations
above 75,000.

Morgan Quitno unveiled the top 10 safest and top 10 most dangerous cities in the
U.S. on Monday, the Associated Press reported.

While its rationale for the ranking likely won't be known until the book is
published, it's likely that a nearly 20 percent increase in violent crime in the
Town of Amherst -- that included a March 2003 homicide in Williamsville --
played a role in unseating the town's top billing.

FBI Uniform Crime Reports reveal that the instances of violent crime went up
from 101 to 120 from 2002 to 2003. Although reports of robberies dropped
slightly and forcible rape was down by half, there was a more than 54 percent
increase in reports of aggravated assault in Amherst from 48 reports in 2002 to
74 in 2003.

The town's lone homicide occurred March 13, 2003, when Jeremy M. Perkins
allegedly stabbed his mother, Elli, 77 times inside their Hopkins Road home
because he thought she had "an evil eye." Perkins was being treated by his
mother with vitamins to deal with his mental illness.

Besides violent crime, property crime in Amherst also increased by about 7.5
percent from 2002 to 2003.

There was a more than 11 percent increase in larcenies and thefts, which were
offset by a 9 percent reduction in burglary and a 24 percent decrease in motor
vehicle theft.

After Amherst, the next seven safest cities in the United States were: Mission
Viejo, Calif.; Clarkstown; Lake Forest, Calif.; Thousand Oaks, Calif.; Colonie;
Cary, N.C.; and Dover Township, N.J.

Camden, N.J., was ranked as the country's most dangerous city followed by
Detroit; Atlanta; St. Louis; Gary, Ind.; Washington, D.C.; Hartford; New
Orleans; Richmond; and Birmingham, Ala.

Professor finds a way to predict future crime -- in your neighbourhood

SOURCE: CanWest News Service

BYLINE: Chris Nuttall-Smith

SECTION: News; Pg. A6

LENGTH: 540 words

U.S. researchers say they've found a way to forecast crimes such as theft,
robbery and simple assault for neighbourhoods as small as 800 square metres --
and they can do it a month in advance.

Wilpen Gorr, a forecasting specialist at Pittsburgh's Carnegie Mellon
University, said he's learned how to combine historical crime data with
variables such as a neighbourhood's poverty rate, population density, even the
number of convenience stores, to predict levels of some crimes within a 10- to
20-per-cent margin of error.

"Business depends on sales forecasting by territory for lots of short-term
decisions on manufacturing, logistics, sales force and so forth. Well, police
have not had this sort of tool," he said. If the police use it, he predicted,
"They'll become more efficient, they'll prevent more crimes, and they'll arrest
more offenders."

Mr. Gorr said the fruits of his research will be available to police forces as a
relatively simple software program by the end of this year.

He said crime within cities varies by neighbourhood type.

Retail areas, for example, see a surge in property crime during holidays, said
Mr. Gorr, while college and university areas experience a trough when students
are away.

The science of crime forecasting isn't new, but it's never been this advanced,
said Mr. Gorr.

As far back as 1833, writers had devised a "temperature aggression hypothesis,"
that linked changes in weather to anger arousal and violent crime.

In the 1950s, one researcher noted that seasonal unemployment and increases in
living expenses influence crime levels. Others drew links between the "rhythms
of neighbourhood life," the so-called "urban ecology" of a place --
characteristics Mr. Gorr describes as "local businesses, land uses, and the
socioeconomic status and demographic characteristics of visitors and residents"
-- and fluctuations in crime.

Today, many major police forces in the U.S. and Canada employ crime analysts who
examine computerized crime mapping data to focus policing resources after
patterns of crime emerge.

But until now, said Mr. Gorr, accurate crime forecasting has been possible only
for large areas such as entire cities. So while police could predict, for
example, 300 larcenies in a city over the course of a month, they haven't been
able to forecast that larcenies would drop by 40 in the east end and spike by 40
downtown.

"Law enforcement takes place in neighbourhoods or car beats and thus small-scale
variation in seasonality matters to police, not overall citywide seasonality,"
Mr. Gorr wrote.

Mr. Gorr's model, developed with two other researchers, takes demographic and
socioeconomic data to create five types of neighbourhoods.

It then throws past crime levels into the mix. In tests in Pittsburgh and
Rochester, New York, Mr. Gorr and his colleagues collected nine years of data
from 911 calls to measure reports of shots fired and drug calls.

They also took police report data for robbery, larceny, motor vehicle theft,
simple assault and aggravated assault. They then marked those data as points on
a map.

The results predicted motor vehicle theft, larceny, simple assault and robbery
accurately, but can't forecast some other more serious offences.

Crime Stayed Flat in 2002, F.B.I. Study Finds

BYLINE:  By FOX BUTTERFIELD

SECTION: Section A; Column 1; National Desk; Pg. 21

LENGTH: 580 words


Crime in the United States remained relatively unchanged in 2002, dropping by a
mere two-tenths of 1 percent, a report released yesterday by the Federal Bureau
of Investigation shows.

Despite a sharp increase in homicides in Los Angeles, 2002 was the third
straight year that serious violent and property crime were essentially flat,
after falling sharply in the 1990's.

But criminal justice experts warned that a number of factors could cause crime
to start increasing again rapidly. Among those factors are the downturn in the
economy, cutbacks in police forces and the courts because of budget shortfalls,
a rise in the number of inmates returning from prison and a larger number of
teenagers.

In fact, in some cities, including Portland, Ore., and Seattle, crime is up
sharply in the first five months of this year.

The F.B.I. report also found an increase in homicide in some big cities last
year, particularly Los Angeles, which led the nation with 654 homicides in 2002,
up from 588 in 2001. Chicago had 648, down from 666, and New York City had 590,
down from 660.

The report found that overall crime in New York City fell 4.8 percent last year,
making New York one of the safest large cities in the country. Car theft and
burglaries also declined significantly in New York.

City officials released figures last week showing that major crime over all in
New York had fallen 8 percent this year from the same period last year.

James Alan Fox, the Lipman family professor of criminal justice at Northeastern
University, said the F.B.I. report could be seen as a case of "no news is good
news."

"Given the fact that there are a lot of factors that could push crime upward and
there was essentially no change, that is good news in itself," Professor Fox, an
expert on crime statistics, said.

But if the federal government, states and cities continue to cut spending for
the police, prisons and the courts because of budget deficits, Professor Fox
said, "This could create a worrisome picture."

"I wouldn't bet on crime remaining stable if things continue as they are," he
said. "It may be just a matter of time."

The bureau's report measures the number of arrests by the police for seven
serious crimes: homicide, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny
and motor vehicle theft. Yesterday's report, part of what is known as the
Uniform Crime Reports, is a preliminary one. The final 2002 report, to be issued
in the fall, will contain figures on crime rates measured by population, a more
accurate way to gauge crime.

The flat overall crime figures for 2002 obscured some changes in individual
types of crimes, and some variations by region.

Homicide, for example, rose eight-tenths of a percent last year from 2001, and
rape jumped 4 percent. Among property crimes, burglary rose 1.5 percent and
motor vehicle theft increased 1.2 percent.

The more striking differences were among the four geographic regions the bureau
uses to divide the nation.

Overall serious crime dropped 3.3 percent in 2002 in the Northeast, 2.1 percent
in the Midwest and 0.1 percent in the South. But in the West, it showed a 2.9
percent increase.

The Northeast, led by New York, also had the biggest drop in homicides last
year, falling 4.8 percent compared with 2001. But the report found that
homicides rose 2.1 percent in the South and 5.2 percent in the West.

Overall crime also increased in suburban areas, where it rose 1.8 percent, and
in rural counties, where it rose 0.4 percent.

U.S. Sets New Drive Against Crime in Public Housing

SECTION: A SECTION; Pg. A17

LENGTH: 346 words


Top officials of the Clinton administration announced a new initiative yesterday
to crack down on crime and drug use within public housing projects.

Addressing several hundred police, prosecutors and public housing residents at
the White House, Vice President Gore said $ 250 million would be provided to
help residents in 13 target cities combat "the scourge of crime and drugs" in
their housing complexes.

"A vast majority of public housing residents are hard-working, law-abiding
citizens," Gore said. "Yet, too often they are victimized by a smaller group who
choose to ignore the law."

The initiative is aimed at addressing a vexing problem, officials said. While
overall violent crime dropped by 7 percent in 1996, the largest decrease in 35
years, many housing projects remain hotbeds of drug dealing and related crimes.

Attorney General Janet Reno said the money would be used to step up law
enforcement efforts and to prevent drug dealing with more investigators and
community-based patrols. Public housing managers will be trained in
community-policing techniques and physical security will be improved with gates
and guard posts, she said.

Gore said the new program, to be carried out jointly by the Justice Department
and the Housing and Urban Development Department, is intended to keep "the
American dream alive and well" at public housing projects.

Officials described the targeted cities as "the worst of the worst," but said if
the program is successful it could be expanded elsewhere. The initial cities are
Chicago, San Francisco, Philadelphia, Detroit, New Orleans, Washington, Newark,
Kansas City, Mo., Boston, Atlanta, Memphis, Gary, Ind., and Greensboro, N.C.

Housing Secretary Andrew M. Cuomo said he would seek an additional $ 20 million
next year to strengthen his department's Operation Safe Home program, an
innovative crime-fighting partnership among federal, state and local officials.

"We must have zero tolerance for people who deal drugs," Cuomo said. "They are
the most vicious, preying on the most vulnerable."

Crime fighters on the march / Neighbors taking back their streets

BYLINE: Robert Davis

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 9A

LENGTH: 943 words


For Shirlene Mercer, it was the empty feeling of watching young boys die that
drove her to the streets.

A year later, the Jackson, Tenn., woman has rallied a town into action. And her
weekly anti-crime marches - leading between 50 and 350 residents into crime
-battered neighborhoods - are credited in part for murders in Jackson falling
from 19 in 1993 to only four so far this year.

"What we have come to understand is when the community comes together, black and
white, rich and poor, everybody gets together and unites to speak out against
the violence, drug dealing and all the things destroying our community," she
says. "I think it could work anywhere."

Crime experts say it is.

Across the country, grass-roots efforts to stop the violence are blooming into a
national attack on crime.

Marches and vigils lead to petition drives, tougher laws and community policing
programs with bite:

-- A grieving wife in Flint, Mich., leads thousands in a fight that brings about
state-wide sentencing reform.

-- A councilman who watches gang members buy arm-loads of ammunition fights to
ban bullet sales in Chicago.

-- A Dallas woman who lost her son to a gang bullet leads marches to counter the
Southern state's pro-gun mentality.

-- A Seattle computer consultant leads volunteers in planting 10,000 daffodils
to remember a slain Japanese student.

-- Pittsburgh police hunt for illegal guns based on anonymous tips to a new hot
line set up by local businesses.

-- Angry Milwaukee residents, scared by soaring murder rates, go door-to-door
seeking to ban handguns.

"It's the only way" to fight crime, says Andrew Chisom, director of a University
of South Carolina anti-violence program that helps 10 Southern states design
prevention programs. "We still think federal bucks can do away with these
problems. They cannot."

He says the efforts "have certainly proven volunteerism is the best interdiction
policy we could have in America because it recruits average Joe Blow citizens."

An estimated 100 million Americans have been affected by violent crime. Some
suffer silently - others want to act.

"It's therapeutic, but it's also exhausting," says Julia Cooper, whose son was
pulled from his car and fatally shot in the head by a gang member two years ago.
Cooper, of Texans Against Violence, says going against gun owners in the Lone
Star State often leaves her "so tired and emotionally drained."

But "it can only do good," she says. "People say we're not changing the world,
and we're not. But one small step at a time is a step in the right direction. I
think this is the way we start." Crime fighters agree.

Attorney General Janet Reno urged local residents to find their own solutions -
create their own battle plans against crime - when she detailed how the Justice
Department will enact the new, sweeping federal crime laws.

Pittsburgh Police Chief Earl Buford says everyone can help.

"It's absolutely critical that the extra eyes and ears are out there to help,"
says Buford. "If there is one thing we've learned in law enforcement, it's that
we can't do the job by ourselves. We all have a stake in this."

Dave Brown, 34, of Boise, Idaho, once walked across the country to raise
awareness of crimes against children. Now he has launched a national magazine
called Wanted by the Law: America's Monthly Crime Report! The magazine tells
stories of heroics by both citizens and police officers. And it's filled with
pictures of the nation's most wanted.

"People want to know who their neighbors are now," Brown says. "Crimes are so
heinous." And, he says, people across the nation are linked by a need to stop
violence. "People are just fed up, but they don't know where to begin."

Next month, people from across the nation will gather at a Washington, D.C.,
conference to learn how to mount grass-roots attacks on gun violence.

The toughest part of the fight, some activists say, is battling the gun lobby.
"On any level, once you get going you're going to run up against the NRA," says
Desmond Riley of the Educational Fund to End Handgun Violence.

"People don't want to be boycotted by gun owners," Riley says. "They don't want
massive mailings sent to them."

But the National Rifle Association promises not to quit fighting to protect gun
owners.

"It's finally very clear that this fight is about them wanting to take every gun
from every American," says NRA chief Wayne LaPierre. "We're not going to let
that happen."

He says cities where guns are banned are not safer.

And, he echoes the NRA call to reform the criminal justice system in an attempt
to keep violent offenders off the streets.

The NRA's goals are similar to Linda Clark's, who often finds people unwilling
to help out of fear of the gun lobby.

"A lot of times there are doors that are closed, but you just have to turn and
go the other way," says Clark, a Flint, Mich., woman who worked for sentencing
reform after her husband was killed in a convenience store holdup. Kevin Clark
had stopped to buy treats for his two children.

"We sometimes forget that we the people are the government," his wife says. "We
have a mandate to say how it's run."

Chisom says programs that work key on kids not much younger than the people
accused of killing Clark's husband. "I don't want to sound mushy, but when
youngsters see that people care, they respond to that care," he says.

Shirlene Mercer says involving kids made Jackson safer.

"That's why we put the children on the front line of our marches," says Jackson.

"We have to teach children that they have to be sensitive about what's going on
around them. As a mama, you care about your children."

HOMICIDE RATES BUCK TREND, RISE IN CHICAGO, LOS ANGELES

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 6E

LENGTH: 553 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON


Homicides are up this year in Chicago and Los Angeles and are at record levels
in cities such as Little Rock, Ark., and Oakland, Calif.  Besides domestic
clashes, officials say, factors contributing to homicides include unemployment,
competition in the illegal and unstable drug business and easy access to guns.
But nationwide, the recent increase in killings seems to have slowed.
Washington, New York City, Houston and Miami - cities notorious for their high
numbers of killings - report homicides down or about even with last year.  The
same goes for many more cities from Honolulu and Anchorage, Alaska, to
Bridgeport, Conn.  In the city of St. Louis, murder is down 10.7 percent. There
were 217 killings as of Thursday, compared wiht 243 on Dec. 10 of last year.
Murders also are down this year in Philadelphia, San Diego and Dallas.
Increases were reported in Los Angeles, Chicago, Phoenix, Detroit and San
Antonio, Texas, but those cities were still below their record highs.  The FBI's
latest tally found a 3 percent decline in homicides nationwide the first six
months of this year compared with that period last year.  Where the number of
murders has fallen, police and politicians credit programs that target drug
dealers, set curfews and enlist community help.  Sheer force also helps, they
say, like the 3,000 new police officers walking beats in New York City.  But
criminologists say that, while such efforts help, the decline was expected.
Homicide rates, it turns out, are pretty constant. What was recently up was apt
to come down.  Many law enforcers agree with homicide Chief Charles Fieramusca
of Buffalo, N.Y.: "If someone wants to kill someone, cops on every street corner
are not going to help. Maybe you can prevent it from happening today, but
they're going to kill tomorrow." Other types of crime, however, are on the rise.
William Wilbanks, a professor of criminal justice at Florida International
University in Miami, said, "Murder is the most serious crime, and people see it
as an indicator if crime is going up or down. That's wrong." The murder rate,
the number of killings per 100,000 people, has stayed around 9 to 10 for the
last 30 or 40 years, Wilbanks said. "It's been remarkably stable when you look
at rape and robbery and assault." Take Charlotte, N.C., where homicides are
down, but Veronica Sorban, crime analyst for Charlotte police, sees no reason to
cheer. "Assaults are up in Charlotte over last year by 11 percent. Robbery is up
9 percent." Crime is also on the move.  Kansas City tied a 3-year-old homicide
record at 140 on Nov. 13 when a security guard driving to work shot a
15-year-old boy. The boy had pointed a gun at the man in an apparent carjacking
attempt. The man has not been charged.  To date, Kansas City , has registered
145 slayings. Over the line in Kansas City, Kan., the new record is 57.  What's
the answer?  In Colorado Springs, Colo., where killings are down, police praise
programs that go after habitual criminals.  Des Moines, Iowa, has a new unit -
or SCAT - that focuses on gangs. Better medical technology there, as elsewhere,
is reducing the toll by keeping more crime victims alive.  New Orleans officials
say community involvement in crime-fighting and government grants that paid for
more police reduced homicides there.

Study shows drop in violent crimes

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 811 words


A Justice Department study out Sunday showed violent crime dropped in urban,
suburban and rural areas between 1981 and 1989. The study shows crime dropped
25% in cities, 17% in suburbs, and 10% in rural areas. The study found rural
dwellers are least likely to be victims of violent crime. And city crime victims
are more likely to shoot at criminals. Among victims of aggravated assault, 2.6%
of city dwellers used guns to defend themselves, compared with 1.8% in the
suburbs and 0.5% in rural areas.
And during 1987-1989:

- Urban rape, robbery and assault rates were 92% higher than in rural areas; 56%
higher than in suburbs.

- 40.6 of every 1,000 city dwellers over the age of 12 were victims of violent
crime. The rates were 21.1 in rural areas and 26 in the suburbs.

- Personal thefts averaged 86 per 1,000 people in cities; 70.1 in suburbs; 45.1
in rural areas.

- 232.1 of every 1,000 urban households were victimized by property crimes -
such as burglary, larceny or auto theft - compared with 152.7 in suburbs; 120.4
in rural areas.

- City dwellers were victimized at higher rates than suburban or rural residents
in most age categories. But rural residents over 65 were most likely to be
burglary victims.

'POINT-OF-LIGHT' DOG SLAIN: Gunfire killed Sandy, the German shepherd mascot of
a New York ambulance company honored last year by President Bush with a Point of
Light award as model volunteers. The dog, 7, was shot outside the van that
serves as headquarters of the company in Brooklyn's Bedford- Stuyvesant area. It
wasn't known whether the dog was the shooter's target. Volunteers, ''crying all
the way,'' rushed Sandy to a veterinary hospital, but it was too late, said
group president James Robinson.

HERO DOG: Carlos Vigil, 34, was hospitalized in stable condition after his
German shepherd, Jill, helped rescue him from their burning home in Santa Fe.
Neighbor Judith Vejvoda said she spotted smoke Saturday after being alerted by
the 12-year-old dog's howls. Vejvoda found Vigil unconscious, and helped pull
him out. ''The dog started to lick his face and he started breathing. It was
amazing,'' she said.

YOUTH KILLED: Chicago police were investigating whether the burning of a police
car and attempted knifing of an officer stemmed from the death of Joseph
Chlopek, 12, shot by police Saturday. Police said the boy ran from two
undercover officers when they spoke to him on a playground and pointed a handgun
at one of the officers, who shot the youth four times. Police said they
recovered a revolver. The boy's mother said he never carried a gun. Police said
the shooting was justified. Hours later, the boy's uncle, Richard Agee, 24, was
charged with aggravated assault for swinging a knife at an officer.

AIDS LAW: Gay civil rights groups praised an administrative law judge's decision
that gay San Francisco police inspector Thomas Cady, 46, is entitled to $ 50,547
in disability medical treatment and $ 25,000 yearly retirement pay because he
got the AIDS virus when bitten and splashed with blood during a 1984 arrest.
''It's difficult for anyone, gay or not, to prove they contracted HIV on the
job,'' said Evan Wolfson of Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund.

- BLUE FLU: A police sickout entered its fourth day in Hartford, Conn., with 72
of 108 officers on the ill list. Police officials and union leaders said no end
was in sight. Catalyst: an officer's arrest for an alleged beating, and
officers' concerns over possible layoffs and thin staffing.

- COMMUTER CRASH: An American Eagle commuter plane from San Juan, Puerto Rico,
crashed in a swampy area and burst into flames while trying to land at an
airport in Mayaguez, Puerto Rico. All five people on board died.

- LOTTO FEVER: Police searched for a woman who robbed a Des Moines grocery store
Friday after spending her $ 60 paycheck on lottery tickets and winning only $
10.

- ROCKET LAUNCH: A Delta rocket lifted off from Cape Canaveral to deploy a $ 214
million satellite to study the sun and other hot stars emitting ultraviolet

Boston may cut off squirt-gun sales

Boston Mayor Raymond Flynn wants to end sales of high-powered squirt guns,
citing the death of 15-year-old Christopher Miles. He was killed by gunfire May
29 when he and other teens were using the toys in a water fight that became a
brawl involving real firearms, police said. Flynn, in a letter to city merchants
today, said the big squirt guns, which can shoot 60 feet or more, can have ''a
very disruptive impact on the quality of life in our neighborhoods.'' Flynn also
questioned whether children should be playing with toy guns, especially in urban
areas where many teen-agers carry real guns. Officials of Larami Corp.,
manufacturer of Super Soaker, couldn't be reached for comment.

FBI: Crime reports are up this year

SECTION: NATIONAL; NATIONAL DIGEST; Pg.  6A

DATELINE: WASHINGTON



The amount of crime reported to police rose 2 percent in the first half of 1991,
the FBI said Sunday. Violent crime reported to law enforcement agencies
increased 5 percent compared with the same period last year, while property
crime edged up 1 percent, said the FBI. The report comes on the heels of a
Justice Department household survey released a week ago showing that crime
overall for all of 1990 declined 3.9 percent. That survey is considered a more
accurate reflection of crime trends because it measures crime generally, not
just crime reported to police. Less than 40 percent of major crimes are reported
to police.

Violent-crime reports rise 5% in first half of '91

BYLINE: Tom Squitieri

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 512 words


Reports of violent crime nationwide during the first half of 1991 rose by 5%,
leading a 2% rise in all major crimes, the FBI reported Sunday.

Some criminologists attributed the rise - the largest jump since the first half
of 1989, when all major crimes rose by 3% - to the recession and economic hard
times.

''We've been talking about an anticipated rise in violence for months, and now
here it is,'' said Paul Tracy, a criminologist at Northeastern University. ''My
only surprise is that (the overall increase) is not 3 or 4%.''

About 16,000 law enforcement agencies across the USA supply information for the
FBI's crime index. The comparison is between the first six months of 1990 and
1991.

Crime dropped 3% in the Northeast, but rose 4% in the Midwest, 3% in the South
and 2% in the West.

Tracy said the deepening recession and rising unemployment are major reasons for
the increase. Another is drug addiction among poor youths in the crime-prone age
group of 15 to 24, said Gene Stephens, University of South Carolina criminal
justice professor.

But James Fyfe, an American University criminologist, said a 2% overall increase
is ''small enough to be attributed to reporting behavior rather than incidents
of crimes.''

Fyfe said it is difficult to gauge the rate of crime, especially in areas ''that
are ravaged by crime, because people just stop reporting it.''

He said homicides and auto theft are the most accurate ways to measure crime
because ''there is a body ... and people report their losses for their car
insurance.''

The FBI also reported:

- Homicides, which hit a record of 23,438 in 1990 and are on pace to hit 23,700
this year, rose 5% in the first half of 1991 across the USA.

- Robberies rose 9%, reported rapes were up 4% and aggravated assaults rose 2%.

- Property crimes, burglary, larceny and motor vehicle theft each rose 1%.

- The nation's big cities showed a 2% drop in crime. The largest increase, 5%,
was in cities of fewer than 10,000.

The FBI report follows a household survey released a week ago that showed
overall crime fell 3.9% in 1990.

That survey, issued by the Justice Department, measures crimes identified by
households, but not necessarily reported to police.

CRIME DATA SHOW LOW JAILING RATE

BYLINE: AP

SECTION: Section A; Page 21, Column 1; National Desk

LENGTH: 437 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 18


Barely one-third of the people arrested on felony charges in 11 states went to
jail, and only a third of those convicted of violent crimes were sentenced to
more than a year, a Justice Department survey found.

A report by the Bureau of Justice Statistics says 84 percent of all those
arrested and charged with felonies were prosecuted and 62 percent were
convicted, but just 36 percent ended up serving time in jail.

The survey, released Sunday, covered 532,000 felony cases resolved in 1984 in
Alaska, California, Delaware, Georgia, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New York,
Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia.

The report also provided a breakdown between blacks and whites and covered the
length of sentences for various levels of crime. Convicted offenders who were
not jailed received sentences such as probation, fines or mandatory community
service, the bureau reported.

The states surveyed account for 38 percent of the nation's population and 37
percent of reported crimes, said Steven R. Schlesinger, bureau director.

'Not Necessarily Typical'

''These statistics are not necessarily typical of felony cases in the rest of
the country,'' Mr. Schlesinger cautioned. He said future surveys would cover
other states and give a ''clearer picture of what is happening nationwide.''

The bureau offered no commentary on the data, which came from state governments.
No identical statistics were available for comparison with previous years.

The report said 36 percent of those convicted of violent felonies did not go to
jail, while 31 percent were sentenced to one year or less and 34 percent
received sentences of one year or more.

Felonies are typically crimes that carry sentences of one year or more in jail,
although state laws vary. Judges often reduce sentences, depending on
circumstances, and first-time offenders are frequently spared jail terms.

The report said about 63 percent of those arrested were white and 37 percent
black. Those classified as other races accounted for less than 1 percent of the
reported crimes, the report said.

Whites were charged with 51 percent of the violent felonies in the survey, while
blacks were charged with 48 percent. Whites accounted for 64 percent of the drug
cases, as against 35 percent involving blacks.

Blacks make up about 12 percent of the total population, but the survey provided
no figure for the percentage of blacks in the surveyed states.

The highest rate of prosecutions, 90 percent, came in public-order felony cases
like weapons offenses, vice cases and parole violations; the lowest, 78 percent,
was for drug offenses, the survey said.

15 ARE CHARED IN CALIFORNIA IN ORGANIZED CRIME INQUIRY

BYLINE: AP

SECTION: Section 1; Page 10, Column 1; National Desk

LENGTH: 424 words

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 22


Eight men have been arrested and seven others have been charged after a
four-year investigation into extortion and drug dealing that has dealt a severe
blow to organized crime in Southern California, the authorities said today.

The man reported to be the head of organized crime in Southern California, Peter
John Milano, 52 years old, was arrested today, along with his brother, Carmen
Joseph Milano, 58, who is in the top command of the crime family, according to
the United States Attorney, Robert Bonner.

Mr. Bonner and Richard Bretzing, head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation
here, said some of those arrested and sought in the investigation were
''capos,'' the organized crime term for street bosses, and that others were
''soldiers'' and ''associates'' of the crime family.

''We have dealt a severe blow to the Los Angeles family,'' Mr. Bretzing said.
''Perhaps we have dealt a decapitating blow to them.''

Attempted Murder Cited

A Federal indictment unsealed today charges the 15 men with extortion,
obstruction of justice and sale of narcotics, cocaine in particular. The charges
were filed under the Federal Racketeering Influenced Corrupt Organization.

Mr. Bonner charged that some of those indicted had attempted murders to protect
the crime family, although none were charged with that offense.

The extortion charges stemmed from loan-sharking and the drug charges stemmed
from trafficking in large amounts of cocaine, the authorities said.

The men who were arrested were taken into custody in the Los Angeles area, Palm
Desert, Calif., and Las Vegas, Nev. Seven other were at large, probably in
Southern California, the authorities said, while one is in a Federal prison in
Illinois.

The indictment charges the 15 with conducting a corrupt organization and
conspiracy, collecting a debt through extortion, attempting to obstruct justice,
conspiracy, attempting to distribute cocaine and distributing cocaine.

Also arrested were Vincent Dominic Caci, 61; Robert Ralph D'Agostino, 54; John
Joseph Vacarro Jr., 47; Stephen Anthony Cino, 50, and Arthur Franconeri, 50, who
is from Bayonne, N.J.

Late today, Charles James Caci, 50, of Palm Springs, turned himself in. Mr. Caco
is also known as Bobby Milano.

Abraham Anthony Prins, 51, who is in the Springfield Federal Correctional
Institute in Illinois, was also indicted.

Being sought were Luigi Gelfuso Jr., 62; his son, Michael Gelfuso, 36; Rocco
James Zangari, 53; Albert Jesus Nunez, 56; Stephen George Munichiello, 26, and
John Patrick Demattia, 50.

Marijuana use reduces violent crime: Study

BYLINE: Malathy Iyer

SECTION: INDIA

LENGTH: 290 words


MUMBAI: The controversy over legalization of medical marijuana gets more
complex. A new study from the University of Texas at Dallas now says that
legalization of medical cannabis may be related to reductions in certain types
of crime. Many groups have held that the trend in the US to allow marijuana
clubs would increase crime rates,especially robbery and assaults.

The study's lead author Dr Robert Morris said, "We're cautious about saying,
'Medical marijuana laws definitely reduce homicide.' That's not what we're
saying." The main finding is that there is no increase in crime rates resulting
from medical marijuana legalization. ``In fact, we found some evidence of
decreasing rates of some types of violent crime, namely homicide and assault,"
he added.

The study, which was published in the journal PLOS ONE, tracked crime rates
across all 50 states between 1990 and 2006, when 11 states legalized marijuana
for medical use: Alaska, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Maine, Montana, Nevada,
Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington. Using crime data from the FBI's
Uniform Crime Report, they studied rates for homicide, rape, robbery, assault,
burglary, larceny and auto theft, teasing out an effect for the passing of
medical marijuana laws. None of the seven crime types increased with the
legalization of medical marijuana.

The study found that robbery and burglary rates were unaffected by medical
marijuana legalization. A press release put out by the University of Texas said,
"These findings run counter to the claim that marijuana dispensaries and grow
houses lead to an increase in victimization because of the opportunities for
crime linked to the amount of drugs and cash that are present."

Violent crimes drop in U.S. border cities;
Increase in homicides not linked to Mexico

BYLINE: Kevin Johnson and Alan Gomez, USA TODAY,

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 525 words


Violent crime continued to fall in the largest U.S. cities along the Southwest
border last year even as neighboring Mexican crime groups clashed for control of
the illegal drug and human smuggling trades.

Ten of the 13 largest cities in Texas, Arizona and California closest to the
Mexican border  recorded reductions in overall violent crime, according to the
latest FBI's Uniform Crime Report.  Eleven of the 13 also saw reductions in
property crime, including burglary and car theft.

While the largest border cities -- San Diego and El Paso -- also reported
declines in violent crimes, murders in each city jumped in 2011. Yet city
officials cautioned that the rise in homicides  could not be attributed to a
spillover in violence from  Mexico.

El Paso recorded 16 murders in 2011, up from just five in 2010, the fewest since
1964. This year, the number is up to 23 killings. Police Sgt. Chris Mears says
the larger numbers are  within range of the average for  the past 20 years.

"None of these homicides are in any way spillover violence from Mexico,'' Mears
says, adding that a number of the  homicides have involved child abuse resulting
in death.

San Diego County Sheriff Cmdr. David Myers says the rise in murder  there - from
29 in 2010 to 38 in 2011 - was largely attributed to a "flurry" of
domestic-related disputes. None of the deaths were linked to Mexican violence,
though Myers says the cartels remain active in the region.

El Paso's proximity to one of the most violent cities in Mexico and world,
Ciudad Jurez, prompted widespread fear last year that Mexican violence -- which
claimed 3,400 lives in Jurez alone in 2010 -- was washing into U.S. border
cities. However, a 2011 USA TODAY analysis of crime data reported by 1,600 law
enforcement agencies in four border states found that violent crime rates on the
U.S. side of the southwestern border have been falling for years.

The analysis concluded that U.S. cities near the border are statistically safer,
on average, than others in their states. The new FBI numbers follow that same
pattern.

Police Chief David Bejarano of Chula Vista, Calif., says the entire Southern
California region is seeing a similar trend.

Overall crime is down in his city of 250,000, which sits  7 miles north of
Tijuana, but murders increased from two in 2010 to six last year.

Bejarano, a former police chief in San Diego, says none of the 2011 murders in
the region was tied to drug cartels. Instead, he says, the area has simply seen
a rise in domestic violence and "traditional gang feuds over turf."

While the Tijuana area was once one of the bloodiest regions in the cartel
battles across the border, Bejarano says those battles have weakened in recent
years.

Tucson was among the few cities where overall violent crime was up. Police Sgt.
Maria Hawke says the increase was so slight -- the total number of violent
crimes increased from 3,331 in 2010 to 3,440 last year -- that it was "not
noticeable.''

The 51 murders recorded last year was equal to  2010, although sexual assaults
jumped from 158 to 204. Hawke says stricter requirements for reporting of such
crimes may have contributed to the increase.

Richmond crime ranked No. 12 in nation

BYLINE: By Kelly Rayburn and Karl Fischer Contra Costa Times

SECTION: BREAKING; My Town; Crime; Contra Costa; News; Local

LENGTH: 465 words


Richmond again joins Oakland and a host of others atop a controversial list of
the nation's most crime-ridden cities.

Richmond, with a population of about 100,000, slipped to No. 14 from No. 9 last
year, coming in behind Compton (No. 12) and remaining well behind Oakland, which
advanced two spots to become the third-most crime-infested city in the country,
according to CQ Press' annual report released over the weekend.

"Last year crime was down," Richmond police Chief Chris Magnus said. "And this
year, though our homicide total has increased, our total crime is actually down
11 percent."

CQ Press analyzes and compares crime data made publicly available by the FBI to
arrive at its conclusions. The report relies on six categories of crime: murder,
rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary and vehicle theft.

"The rankings tell an interesting and an important story regarding crime in the
United States," the company said in a statement. "Annual rankings not only allow
for comparisons among different states and cities, but also enable leaders to
track their communities' crime trends from one year to the next."

The rankings regularly draw fire from mayors and law-enforcement officials
across the country. The United States Conference of Mayors last year ripped the
report, calling it "misleading and a disservice to the public."

The company relies on FBI statistics, and in 2007, the bureau attacked the
report, saying the "rough rankings provide no insight into the numerous
variables that mold crime in a particular town, city, county, state or region."

Oakland's No. 3 ranking came despite a drop in crime of roughly 3 percent from
2007 to 2008.

What's not reflected in the report   which looked at crime data from Jan. 1 to
Dec. 31, 2008   is that Oakland is experiencing a more significant drop in crime
this year. As of Nov. 11, reports of serious crime were down 13 percent in 2009
compared with the same point in 2008, while homicides had dropped 17 percent.

Even with the drop, Oakland police Chief Anthony Batts, who started the job Oct.
19, has repeatedly called the city's crime rate "unacceptable" and even "an
outrage."

"The level of carnage that takes place in this city to me is abhorrent, is an
outrage in a city of this size," Batts said. "My passion is trying to stop the
level of murders, homicides and deaths in this city if I possibly can."

Topping this year's list as the highest-crime city in the U.S. was Camden, N.J.
After Camden were St. Louis; Oakland; Detroit; and Flint, Mich, in that order.
Compton was the third California city in the top 35.

Richmond ranked No. 9 in each of the past two years before dropping to No. 14.
Oakland placed fifth last year and fourth the previous year.

Collection of prisoner DNA widens

BYLINE: Richard Willing

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 495 words

More states are moving to collect DNA from thousands of non-violent criminals,
such as burglars and check forgers, after already taking it from murderers and
rapists.

The number of states collecting DNA from all convicted felons, and not just the
most violent, has risen from seven in 2000 to 19 this year. Two more states,
Illinois and Arizona, are likely to join the list before their legislatures
adjourn this summer.


Driving the new direction is research indicating that DNA databases in Virginia,
Florida and other states now routinely solve murders, rapes and other violent
crimes by linking them to criminals who have been convicted of burglary,
forgery, drug possession and other non-violent offenses.

Another factor: Privacy advocates have largely dropped their argument that
taking DNA from non-violent criminals is a useless intrusion.

"The very real privacy concerns that are raised about adding what seem to be
minor criminals (to DNA databases) at first were difficult to overcome," says
Tim Schellberg, an attorney for a DNA equipment manufacturer who has lobbied
states to include non-violent crimes. "Now the numbers are leading the debate."

All states and the District of Columbia collect DNA, the biological material
that contains an individual's genetic code, from people who are convicted of
crimes that are specified by each state's legislature.

Crimes are solved by matching DNA collected at crime scenes with the DNA of
convicted offenders through computers.

Virginia, which has collected DNA from burglars and other non-violent felons
since 1990, has found that even white-collar criminals, such as forgers, can go
on to commit more serious crimes.

Ten of the 22 Virginia forgers who have been linked to other crimes through the
state's DNA database were linked to murders or sexual assaults, state records
show.

Nearly two-thirds of the 60 crimes linked to people convicted of drug possession
were rapes or murders, according to Virginia's records.

Since July 2000, when Florida began taking DNA from convicted burglars, 28% of
homicide matches and 12% of sexual-assault matches have been to people
previously convicted of burglary.

Since the mid-1990s, 36 lawsuits in 21 state and federal jurisdictions have
challenged the DNA collection statutes, the FBI says.

Only one, a Massachusetts suit, prevailed. It later was overturned.

Youths at crime prevention meet pitch in

BYLINE: By Sean Kelly, Special to The Denver Post

LENGTH: 364 words


Following a 14-hour drive from Fort Smith, Ark., David Kale wasn't looking to
rest.

After arriving in town for the National Youth Crime Prevention Conference, Kale
and about 60 other teens hopped a bus Wednesday afternoon and went to help the
homeless at the Salvation Army's Crossroads shelter at 29th Street and Broadway.

"We left last night and drove straight through," said Kale, one of six teens
from Fort Smith's Mayor's Youth Volunteer Corps attending the conference. "So
many people showed up to help today, there's really not much to do. I wish we
could do more."

Nearly 2,000 teens are expected to attend the conference, which officially
begins this morning. Now in its 12th year, the conference is being held in
Denver for the first time after more than a decade in Florida.

The conference, presented by the National Crime Prevention Council and the Youth
Crime Watch of America, runs through Saturday at the Adam's Mark Hotel.
Attendees, ages 12-22, will take part in workshops and forums to discuss
problems affecting youth, from violence to racism to teen pregnancy.

"I think the workshops are going to be great," Kale said after helping pick up
trash along the South Platte River near the shelter. "After today, I'm really
looking forward to them."

Denver teens Danielle Nichols-Moralez and Joel Stangle helped organize many
events for the conference as members of the Safe City Youth Power organization.
They were helping serve dinner to homeless men at the shelter.

Nichols-Moralez, who attends Manual High School, said she truly enjoys community
service. "It tells people that we're here, and we're helping," she said. "It
shows people that the youth can do something for the community."

As one of eight students attending the conference from Washburn Rural High
School in Topeka, Kan., Tyrone Brown was greeting the men as they sat down to
eat. Trying to strike up conversation was difficult for this shy member of his
school's Crimestoppers, but it was rewarding, he said.

"I've been to a shelter in Topeka, but it's a lot smaller than this," Brown
said.

"I think this is a good experience for all of us. I think it's good for both us
and them."

City bows to Newark in violent crime stats

BYLINE: R. Robin McDonald; STAFF WRITER

SECTION: LOCAL NEWS, Pg. 3C

LENGTH: 318 words


Atlanta is losing its dubious distinction as the nation's most violent city this
year, passing that designation to Newark, N.J., according to FBI crime
statistics released this week.

Still, Atlanta - which topped the violent crime charts last year - remains among
the country's most dangerous cities, behind only Newark and St. Louis, according
to crime rates compiled by The Atlanta Journal- Constitution.

And Atlanta ranks fourth among U.S. cities with more than 250,000 residents in
reports of major violent and property crime per 10,000 residents, according to
computations based on the new FBI crime figures in its preliminary report of
1994 crime statistics.

Las Vegas, Tampa and Miami ranked higher, according to the newspaper's analysis.

"One year's reduction is probably too soon to say we've turned the corner,"
Atlanta Deputy Chief C.B. Jackson said Tuesday. "But we do think we're headed in
the right direction."

But Atlanta was not alone in experiencing a drop in crime last year. Across the
nation, reports of major crime fell 3 percent, according to the FBI. In the
nation's largest cities, crime reports dropped by twice that rate, the FBI
reported.

Nationwide, violent crime - homicide, rape, robbery and aggravated assault -
dropped by 4 percent, according to the FBI.

In Atlanta, violent crime dropped by 8 percent and homicides fell to their
lowest point since 1986.

But Atlanta police also made far fewer arrests in 1994, according to city police
statistics. Felony arrests for violent crime fell by nearly double the rate of
reported crime, according to Atlanta police statistics.

Mayor Bill Campbell on Tuesday credited the city's police with the drop in crime
numbers last year. But crime, he said, continues to be his administration's
first priority. "We will never let statistics lull us into thinking that we
don't have a problem with crime," he said.

In NYC, 'a full-court press' on gunrunners

BYLINE: Bruce Frankel

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 12A

LENGTH: 443 words

DATELINE: NEW YORK


The mayor and police commissioner Monday announced a tough new program designed
to stem the tide of illegal weapons in a city "drowning in guns."

The backbone of their strategy calls for cutting the gun supply by spending more
time pursuing criminal accomplices and gun traffickers - much the way law
enforcement has for years gone after organized crime and drug traffickers.

"We're going to put on a full-court press," says Police Commissioner William
Bratton. Getting guns off the streets of New York "will become the basic
business of 31,000 cops."

The strategy calls for buying a computer system to match guns used in more than
one crime, and adding officers to a joint NYPD-Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms task force to pursue gunrunners.

The first in what's expected to be a series of anti-crime measures, the gun
campaign is intended to make good on Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's promises to reduce
violent crime.

Although thousands of guns are confiscated in New York each year, Giuliani says
police have failed in the past to learn "the story that lies behind the gun" -
and "the conspiracy" that brought it here.

About 90% of an estimated 2 million illegal guns in New York come from other
states, mainly Florida, Ohio, Texas and Virginia, police say.

The fatal ambush last week of a van full of Hasidic Jews is a "perfect" example,
says Bratton. Three of the four weapons in the case have been traced to
out-of-state dealers.

The city faces a tough battle. Gun-related homicides in New York have soared
from 75 in 1960 - 25% of the total - to 1,541 - 75% - in 1992.

"No matter what we do here, we're going to need help" from the federal
government, Giuliani says.

Starting today, the police department's street crimes unit will focus on the
areas of the city with the highest crime.

Murders are concentrated here in what national researchers call crime "hot
spots." In 1992, 12 of the city's 75 precincts accounted for more than 40% of
1,995 murders.

By following an approach being tested in Kansas City and Indianapolis, "you may
make a significant impact," says Thomas Repetto of the Citizens Crime
Commission.

"They're fulfilling the promise they made to me and all New Yorkers," says
Fernando Mateo, a carpet executive who founded a toys-for-guns program last
Christmas. "When a patient is hemorrhaging, you have to stop the blood flow
before you start the cure."

"It's exciting. There's an awful lot of logic if the states and feds get into
the picture to get a track on these people running up and down (Interstate) 95
with carloads of guns, day and night," says Patrick Murphy of the U.S.
Conference of Mayors.

Traumatized by gunfire, children suggest solutions

BYLINE: Robert Davis

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 4A

LENGTH: 456 words


Teary-eyed and emotional, 11 children whose lives have been scarred by gunfire
urged politicians Thursday to help stop violent crime.

Monique Malloy, 16, of Washington, D.C., told members of the House Subcommittee
on Crime and Criminal Justice to stop "standing outside the circle. We're
standing inside the circle."

Four of Malloy's friends, including a cousin, have been shot to death in the
past two years. She urged politicians who want to help to "talk the talk and
walk the walk."

Some of the kids' solutions:

-- A national curriculum on conflict resolution. "There is a lot of anger inside
young people today," said Alicia Brown, 14, of Washington, D.C., who watched a
friend die. "They don't talk it out. Instead, they take their anger out on other
people."

-- Mandatory gun safety education. Deseree Troy, 13, of Indianapolis, said gun
buyers should have to attend safety classes during the five-day waiting period
now mandated by federal law. "It's a hassle, but would you rather be hassled by
that or by paying for a funeral bill because your child got a hold of your gun?"

-- Tougher sentences for kids who kill. "If a kid is old enough to shoot
somebody, he's old enough to be put away," said Megan McGillicuddy, 15, of New
York City, whose principal was killed two years ago when he was caught in the
cross fire of drug dealers.

But McGillicuddy also urged lawmakers to send a more caring message to children
who don't use guns. "Help the kid," she said. "Show them you care instead of
putting them down."

Janea Wells, 15, of Washington, said she was standing in her front yard when a
friend was killed by gunfire

"I'm scared to leave my house in the evening," said Wells. "I would like to move
away from this neighborhood, but my mother doesn't have enough money to move."

Marian Wright Edelman of the Children's Defense Fund asked lawmakers for
stronger gun controls and more money for neighborhood programs.

"We have failed miserably in our most basic responsibility - protecting our
children," said Edelman. An assortment of problems "too long neglected" have
created "inner city neighborhoods where the future means surviving the day and
living to 18 is a triumph."

Subcommittee chairman Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said he'll introduce gun control
legislation that would:

-- Limit gun purchases to one a month and require gun licenses like drivers
licenses.

-- Impose stiffer penalties for gun thefts, and require all gun transfers to be
registered.

-- Make it more difficult and expensive to be a gun dealer.

"We have to stop wringing our hands and pointing our fingers," said Rep. Craig
Washington, D-Texas. "When a child is lying on a slab in the morgue, we as a
society are harmed."

BUSH MOTORS INTO DETROIT WITH DRIVE AGAINST CRIME

BYLINE: SIMON TISDALL IN DETROIT

SECTION: THE GUARDIAN FOREIGN PAGE; Pg. 10

LENGTH: 788 words


PRESIDENT Bush walked out of the White House yesterday for the last time before
the election and plunged into a week-long, country-wide campaign charge that
will end in either his rejection or reprieve next Tuesday.

Buoyed by a spate of new opinion polls showing Bill Clinton's national lead down
to about eight points and falling, Mr Bush made first for Detroit, sweeping into
cloudy-skied, run-down Motown in the speeding motorcade which has come to
symbolise the imperial American presidency.

Addressing the International Association of Chiefs of Police, Mr Bush called for
tougher penalties for criminals, including mandatory death penalties, and
attacked Mr Clinton's record on crime in Arkansas.

"I have big differences with Governor Clinton on crime," he said. "Violent crime
has risen by 60 per cent in Arkansas in the 1980s, twice the national average.
The average inmate in Arkansas serves less than one fifth of his term in jail."

Mr Bush also lambasted Congress for blocking his comprehensive crime bill, which
was first proposed in 1989, and promised a six-point package of anti-crime
measures during a second term. He said he planned to enforce the death penalty,
limit further the right of appeal, increase prison space, and propose new laws
to curtail domestic violence.

The Republican governor of Michigan, Jim Engler, said Mr Clinton's support in
the battleground state was "receding" and the situation was "moving very fast
towards Bush".

Before leaving Washington Mr Bush had said: "We're going to win the election
because we're right on the issues." He predicted he would score a "stunning
upset victory".

Aides said Mr Bush would await the election results in his adopted home town of
Houston, Texas. After Detroit, he was heading for the hills, in South Dakota and
Montana - normally safe Republican territory, but not this time.

Despite Mr Bush's scepticism, senior aides were ecstatic over the latest polls,
which finally showed a tightening in the presidential race. "It's going our
way," said campaign spokeswoman Torie Clarke.

Mr Bush's last-gasp attempt to salvage a second term from the ruins of one of
the most inept presidential campaigns in recent memory did not include the
biggest state, California. Along with Washington and Oregon, the Golden state
was not on his itinerary, suggesting that he and his top adviser, James Baker,
have conceded the Pacific West to Mr Clinton.

Mr Bush's unceasing attempts to depict Mr Clinton as unworthy of the
electorate's trust appeared to be having some impact. According to Time
magazine, 51 per cent of voters now believe the Democrat is a "tax-and-spend
liberal" and 63 per cent found Mr Bush to be more "honest and trustworthy". Mr
Clinton's "negatives" are rising, Time found, with only 33 per cent of voters
expressing a favourable opinion of him.

But on this very subject of trust, Mr Bush was himself under fire yesterday over
the Saddamgate scandal. Continuing investigations produced evidence that as
secretary of state, Mr Baker lobbied within the administration for loans to Iraq
in 1989, despite warnings that Iraq was using the money to buy arms. The quid
pro quo was reported to have been Iraq's help in advancing US-brokered peace
talks between Israel and the Palestinians.

Mr Bush has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing by his administration in its
relations with President Saddam before the Gulf war.

The president was also at pains at the weekend to distance himself from state
department investigations of Mr Clinton's and Mr Clinton's mother's passport
records in connection with the Vietnam era peace movements. It had nothing to do
with him, Mr Bush said.

Mr Bush's last campaign charge, which will also take him to Colorado and the
south-west before coming back to crucial mid-Western states like Michigan and
Ohio, was described as an effort to prove "he's waving, not drowning".

For despite the narrowing of the race, Mr Clinton still appears to be on course
for an electoral college majority, while Mr Perot, though, rising, is not
considered competitive.

By playing on worries about Mr Clinton, Mr Bush hopes to turn attention away
from his own record and transform the election into a referendum on his
opponent's fitness to serve, aides said. The success or otherwise of this
last-gasp stratagem will be known by a week tomorrow.

- President Bush yesterday signed a bill that increases US contributions to the
International Monetary Fund by $ 12 billion ( pounds 7.5 billion) in order to
help the economic development of the former Soviet republics. The legislation
also provides help in the destruction of nuclear weapons.

Black organized crime disguised by racial stereotyping, police   told

BYLINE: TIMOTHY APPLEBY; GAM

LENGTH: 793 words

DATELINE: LOUISVILLE, Ky.


BY  TIMOTHY APPLEBY
 The Globe and Mail
  LOUISVILLE, Ky.
    Black organized crime has been ingrained in U.S. society for decades,
police chiefs from around the world were told this weekend, but it has
been cloaked by a "veil of secrecy" rooted in racial stereotypes.

As black officers in the audience nodded in agreement, Frederick
Martens, the executive director of the Pennsylvania Crime Commission, told
a workshop that three successive presidential commissions have ignored the
phenomenon.

Mr. Martens was speaking at the annual convention of the International
Association of Chiefs of Police . Law enforcement officers from about 22
countries have shown up so far.

"There's a mindset out there that there's a lack of capacity of black
people to organize," Mr. Martens said.

"It gets referred to as disorganized crime and, if it doesn't fit the
model of  la cosa nostra, then it can't be organized crime."

He prefaced his remarks by emphasizing his view that no racial group is
intrinsically crime-prone.

Rather, he said, organized crime "is part of our history, it was born
out of American enterprise," and U.S. blacks are in a long line of
minorities who have realized that "money buys dignity."

Black crime syndicates date back to the 1920s, when they ran numbers
rackets and loan sharking, Mr. Martens said.

Today, they are concentrating on the West Coast. He cited a Los Angeles
cocaine organization whose kingpin, despite being in jail, was able to
expedite major drug deals in other states, and also ran legitimate
businesses in Beverly Hills.

Many other black crime groups, he said, have links across the country.
Yet there has been a wilful reluctance to accept that black criminals are
as skilful as anyone else at laundering money, for instance, Mr. Martens
said.

Most recently, president Ronald Reagan struck a commission to examine
organized crime. At the end of its three-year study in 1986, Mr. Martens
said, 10 of the 18 members dissented from its findings on the grounds that
"the commission has failed to address the roles of American blacks . . .
and Jewish organized crime."

U.S. police have been more ready to acknowledge this "avenue of social
mobility" than have politicians and officials, he said, citing a New York
Police Department study identifying 64 of 200 organized-crime groups in
the state as being black.

His remarks struck a chord.

"It was obvious where I was growing up on the block - Bedford-
Stuyvesant (an impoverished district in New York City) - that it was all
organized," one black officer said.

"This is something we ought to be preparing for," said Kansas City
Police Chief Larry Joiner, who heads the IACP's organized crime committee.

Despite the international flavor of the conference, the overwhelming
majority of the roughly 8,000 delegates at the five-day conveetion are
from the United States, with about 20 from Canada.

They listened to presentations on topics ranging from crack cocaine to
forfeiture of criminals' assets, to the transportation of hazardous
materials.

At a workshop in which officers gave retrospective assessments of major
crises they had handled, the British policeman who took charge after an
assassination attempt on Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said the
incident "has completely changed the nature of security operations in the
U.K."

Roger Birch, Chief Constable of Sussex, said that when the Irish
Republican Army bombed a Brighton Hotel in 1984, killing five people and
maiming many others, "my team just couldn't believe what happened."

Before Mrs. Thatcher returned to Brighton for another Conservative
Party conference, more than 60,000 people had been interviewed by police
and the cost of the massive security operation surpassed $200-million.

A Scottish police officer who took part in investigating last
December's bombing of a Pan-Am jet over the small town of Lockerbie
described the difficulties of trying to identify the 270 victims.

Flung from the exploding plane at a height of 10 kilometres, only five
were recognizable.

Constable Stephen Manion of Lockerbie said appeals from 22 different
countries began pouring in, asking that the bodies and personal effects be
shipped home.

There were delays because after it was established that the explosion
was caused by sabotage, "we now had a criminal inquiry," and everything
became a piece of potential evidence.

Drugs are a major focus of the convention. On Saturday, a packed
auditorium was told by the commander of the narcotics unit in Washington,
D.C., that "if you do not have a crack problem just wait - it's on the
way."

Captain Collin Younger said that crack is "at an epidemic stage" in his
city and 60 per cent of the homicides are drug related.

Last year a record was set for homicides in Washington, he said, with a
total of 263. This year there have already been at least 357.

Florida crime rate highest in nation

DATELINE: TALLAHASSEE; MIAMI; OCALA



TALLAHASSEE - Florida's total crime rate is the highest in the nation -
exceeding the national average by more than 50 percent, a Florida State
University analyst said in a report released Monday. The public-policy    report
also said Florida's rate of violent crime ranked first in the    nation, and led
to a correspondingly large prison population. The state    ranks seventh
nationally in spending for police, spending $ 123 per    person, or $ 8.69 per $
1,000 of personal income, in 1987 for protection.

 The study showed the state's 1987 crime rate of 8,503 crimes per    100,000
population dramatically exceeded the national average of 5,555    by a whopping
53 percent. Florida also ranked at the bottom of the list    in violent crime -
murder, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated    assault. The state registered
1,024 violent crimes per 100,000    population in 1987, compared with the
national average of 609.7.



 NAACP calm over black official's refusal

 MIAMI - NAACP officials here have shrugged off the refusal of a black    city
commissioner to talk with a white member of the biracial    organization at a
public meeting. City Commissioner Miller Dawkins said    at a March 3 meeting
that only blacks should speak to him on behalf of    the civil rights group.
Johnnie R. McMillian, president of the NAACP    chapter, said she was not upset
by Dawkins' position. "He has that    right, if that is what he feels," she
said. "We do have whites in the    NAACP. It's not an unusual thing. It's a
biracial organization and has    been since its inception in 1909." The incident
occurred March 3    during routine discussion of an NAACP request for the
commission to    waive its rental fee for a city-owned center. When Ronald Houk,
who is    white and chairman of the Miami-Dade NAACP's industry and labor
committee, got up to discuss the issue at the morning session, Dawkins
objected.



 Soldier drowns in dive instructor training

 OCALA - A 28-year-old military bomb expert accidentally drowned while
training with five civilian divers at 40 Fathom Grotto, Marion County
sheriff's deputies said. The victim, identified as Capt. John P. Winand    of
Fayetteville, N.C., was found in the water by fellow divers at 4    p.m. Sunday,
said Sgt. Ken Ergle. The death has been ruled an accident    pending an autopsy
by the medical examiner, Ergle said. No foul play is    suspected. He might have
suffered nitrogen poisoning, a phenomenon that    affects deep sea divers,
deputies said. Winand and five others were    being trained to be diving
instructors. The group went into the water    about 9:40 a.m. Sunday, summoning
deputies a short time later when    Winand disappeared below the surface water,
deputies said. The grotto    is about 270 feet deep.



 Group calls for reform of prison program

 TALLAHASSEE - Florida's prison-industries program, although improved,    still
focuses too much on profits and not enough on reducing the number    of inmates
returning to prison, concluded an independent report issued    Monday. Florida
TaxWatch, a private research group aimed at government    efficiency, said the
Legislature should force Prison Rehabilitative    Industries and Diversified
Enterprises Inc., or PRIDE, to compete more    for state contracts. PRIDE
president J. Floyd Glisson said the group's    goal was not to compete with the
private sector, rather to provide    products to the state at low prices. In a
two-year study of the
 program, TaxWatch found that PRIDE was not fully meeting its primary
objectives of reducing government costs by using inmate labor, teaching    work
skills, and increasing prison security by reducing inmate    idleness. About
2,500 inmates work for PRIDE.

The Editorial Notebook;
Crime in New York, Compared

BYLINE: By David C. Anderson

LENGTH: 489 words


The season's crime news has generated a spasm of self-doubt for New Yorkers,
driving some to seek comfort from statistics suggesting that other cities have
more crime. They can't find much.

There are plenty of raw data. Each year the Federal Bureau of Investigation
publishes a hefty compilation of crimes reported to American police. Since the
bureau gives reports by metropolitan statistical area and calculates rates of
crimes per 100,000 population, its figures are often seized upon as the basis
for city-to-city comparisons of criminal activity.

The 1989 figures put New York in an unremarkable 15th place for all crimes, with
a rate of 8,861 per 100,000 residents. That's well behind Miami, with a whopping
14,012, Dallas, with 10,936, and many smaller cities, mostly in Texas and
Florida.

Yet it's misleading to base comparisons on the F.B.I. figures because they refer
only to reported crimes, and these give only a small picture of total crime.
That has been apparent for more than two decades, since the beginning of crime
-victim surveys.

The current National Crime Survey, run by the Bureau of Justice Statistics,
polls members of 50,000 households, asking if they were victims of crime during
the year. The 1989 survey found 36.1 million victims, more than twice the number
of reported crimes tabulated by the F.B.I.

The survey also asks those who don't report why they don't. Some people consider
the crime a private matter, or see no point in reporting if there is little
chance of recovering stolen property. Others resist hassles with police they
believe can't do much about the crime in any case. Only 62 percent report
robberies. But 92 percent report auto theft; insurers require reports before
paying claims.

The victimization figures also cast doubt on the F.B.I. figures because they are
not rising. While the F.B.I.'s tallies of crime reports rose 10 percent between
1985 and 1989, the victimization numbers declined 2 percent.

There is, however, one figure that does permit some comparison of relative
violence: the F.B.I. figure for murder. There is no reason to doubt its
accuracy, since virtually all murders are reported.

Current F.B.I. figures for murder offer New Yorkers little reassurance. The
metropolitan area's 1,951 murders last year yielded a rate of 22.7 per 100,000,
a figure exceeded only by New Orleans, with 24.7. And this year, murders in the
city are running well ahead of last year; the total will probably exceed 2,000.
Using the F.B.I.'s census-based population estimate for the area, 7.4 million,
2,000 murders would indicate a rate of 27 per 100,000, a figure no other city is
likely to exceed.

But then, the validity even of the murder figure is subject to another limit:
uncertainty about urban census counts. If New York's population were actually a
million more than the count, as Mayor Dinkins has insisted, the murder rate
would be a slightly less horrendous 23.8.

San Jose holds steady as fourth-safest big city

LENGTH: 422 words


Despite drops in crimes ranging from assault to burglary to motor vehicle theft,
San Jose still can't reclaim the bragging rights to being America's "Safest Big
City."

But city officials can crow about improvements in many areas.

"We're pleased we held steady, and we're the safest big city in California,"
said Assistant Police Chief Dan Katz.

The city remained at No. 4 on the annual list of safest cities with populations
of 500,000 or more, based on crime rates per 1,000 people. The report, issued
Monday and published by CQ Press, is based on FBI crime statistics for 2008.

San Jose trailed Honolulu, El Paso, Texas, and New York City.

Critics say the crime statistics reported to the FBI and analyzed by CQ Press
can be misleading. The FBI, which warns on its Web site against making such
rankings, relies on law enforcement agencies themselves to report the
statistics.

Before dropping to the third spot in 2007, San Jose had earned the distinction
of "Safest Big City" for six consecutive years. Last year, Mayor Chuck Reed said
the city had enjoyed the bragging rights of being ranked No. 1 and was committed
to regaining the title.

Reed in a statement Tuesday said maintaining San Jose's crime ranking is a
notable achievement given the economic downturn and state funding raids on local
governments.

"I am proud that San Jose experienced a steady drop in most major categories of
crimes last year," the mayor said.

Katz attributed the drop in most crimes, which followed a spike in 2007, to
increased focus on gang-prevention efforts. Police also stepped up focus on auto
thefts and burglaries, which had been driving up the property crime statistics.

San Jose couldn't rise further than fourth place despite seeing year-to-year
drops in seven of 10 types of crime included in the annual FBI report. San Jose
saw significant decreases in burglary (22.3 percent), motor vehicle theft (18.5
percent) and arson (15 percent).

The city also reported smaller decreases in property crime (7.3 percent),
aggravated assault (7.1 percent), violent crime (3.1 percent) and homicides
(from 33 to 31).

The only increases in crime in 2008 were robbery (5.2 percent), larceny-theft
(3.1 percent) and rape (from 217 cases to 220).

Although San Jose experienced a gang-related shooting on Halloween night that
left a 12-year-old boy unconscious at a hospital, overall gang violence through
September is down 14.5 percent this year compared with 2008, according to the
data reported to the FBI.

Philadelphia force gets NYC infusion

BYLINE: Martha T. Moore

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 4A

LENGTH: 774 words

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA


PHILADELPHIA -- The police station with the scarred blue doors
is in a neighborhood that maps call Kensington but that cops call
the Badlands. Here, the drug trade and the violence flourish along
streets of boarded-up row houses, in what district captain William
Colarulo says is the city's busiest precinct.

But someone showed up for roll call at 7 a.m. Monday of a rank
that officers can't recall attending before: the police commissioner.
John Timoney, former beat cop from New York's version of the Badlands,
the South Bronx, made the embattled 25th District his first stop
on his first day on the job.


A week ago, Timoney was in thickly carpeted, glass-doored Manhattan
offices that befit a highly paid consultant, not in this disinfectant-scented
roll call room, where he promised to come back for a 1 a.m. patrol.

What brought him here? The drop in crime in Timoney's New York
-- from 2,256 murders in 1992 to 756 last year -- has turned the
city's top cops into hot properties. As high-profile consultants,
former commissioner William Bratton and deputy commissioners Timoney
and Jack Maple have spread the New York gospel of computerized
crime mapping and quality-of-life arrests, such as jaywalking
and loitering. Philadelphia, with seemingly intractable crime
rates, wants New York's success.

Timoney, 49, an Irish-born "cop's cop" who rose through New
York's ranks to the No. 2 spot, was ready to pin on a badge again.

"Because it's fun, it's challenging, it's exciting, it's what
I do best," he said last week. "It's getting back into the game."

For $ 113,000 a year, about half his consulting earnings, he is
taking on a city where the murder rate is stubbornly high -- more
than 400 a year. Five people were gunned down in this month's
first weekend.

Of murders, 45% are narcotics-related. Guns are epidemic. The
crime rate -- well, no one is quite sure. Department methods for
counting crimes were so flawed, the FBI refused to include the
numbers in its 1996 uniform crime report, the most recent statistics
available.

Residents know that in other cities crime has been falling farther
longer. An analysis of crime trends by The Philadelphia
Inquirer -- to address the confusion about how the city was
counting crimes -- showed that from 1992 to 1996, major crime
rose 13%, while it was falling 10% in Chicago, 29% in Los Angeles,
and 38% in New York.

"We need to change," says Det. Sean Brennan, a detective with
17 years of experience. "The way things are going now, we're
losing it. The overall battle I don't know, but we're starting
to lose some of the wars."

One of the first battles Timoney faces, though, is with police
methods, not the bad guys. Like a business consultant who teaches
total quality management, Timoney is here to import the techniques
that worked in New York.

Timoney has less than two years -- until a new mayor succeeds
Ed Rendell and names a new commissioner. And he can't do it by
just cleaning house: He can appoint only two jobs in the 7,000-strong
force. Civil service rules cover the rest.

However members of the force -- street officer and detectives
alike -- say they want a commissioner who will let them police
aggressively and support them. "If he shows that he is going
to back the average patrol officer, we're going to give him 110%,"
says patrol supervisor Sgt. George Ondrejka.

Backing officers here can be tricky. Philadelphia has an unhappy
history, from the tough-guy tactics of former police chief and
Mayor Frank Rizzo to a recent corruption scandal in the 39th District,
where police officers were convicted of framing citizens.

The expectation is that aggressive policing will lead to an increase
in complaints against police, as it did in New York. That's not
a necessary tradeoff, Timoney argues: "The idea of being an aggressive
police force, going out there, dealing with drugs on a daily basis
does not necessarily mean that the police force has to be brutal,
has to be corrupt, has to use extra-legal measures."

Philadelphia residents, he says, "want the police to succeed.
But I also think if we don't succeed there'll be great disappointment."

That's putting it mildly. Like its sports fans who are notorious
for booing even great athletes during temporary slumps, Philadelphia
does not take failure kindly, or for long. Timoney's first day
on the job turned out to be the last for Philadelphia Flyers coach
Wayne Cashman.

"You know how this place is," says City Council President John
Street. "It's either win the Super Bowl -- or else."

APPLE POLISHES OFF COMPETITION

BYLINE: By MIKE CLAFFEY, With Russ Buettner

SECTION: News; Pg.  2

LENGTH: 400 words


New York is indeed Safer City especially compared with other cities in the
nation.

Atlanta? Not even close. Newt Gingrich's proud Peach State metropolis had the
worst crime rate of 189 major cities.

Orlando? Try again. Mickey and Co. was third worst.

Honolulu? Fuhgeddaboudit. The land of luaus couldn't best the Big Apple.

New York ranks the safest among the nation's eight cities with a population of
at least 1 million, according to statistics released by the FBI last week.

Overall, New York ranked 150th out of 189 cities in terms of major crimes with
2,359 major crimes per 100,000 people for the first six months way ahead of
Seattle (ranked 35th), Houston (83rd) and Denver (118th), and nosing out San
Diego (145th) and Boise, Idaho (149th).

The city's crime rate posted a reduction of more than 9% in the first six months
of the year, well ahead of the national drop of 4%.

New York City ranked 71st for its homicide rate with 5.1 per 100,000 sandwiched
between Raleigh, N.C., and Santa Rosa, Calif. The homicide rate is down 22.3%
this year, and on pace for about 760, which would be the lowest tally since
1967.

Mayor Giuliani takes delight in pointing out that New York's tourist industry
and economy in general reap huge dividends from the drop in crime and the
increased perception of safety.

In fact, a recent survey of favorite U.S. travel destinations found New York
State had jumped from eighth place to a tie for fourth place with Nevada, a
traditional tourist mecca that boasts the glittering lights of Las Vegas (84th
on the crime list) and Reno (106th).

The survey of 1,500 people, released last summer by the Travel Industry
Association and the American Automobile Association, found that New York was
behind only Florida, California and Hawaii.

"I think it's very safe if you know where you're going or you ask people from
here," said Xavier Ponson, 23, a tourist from Grenoble, France. "I think it's as
safe as Paris, but I know there are some places you should not go."

The city's crimefighting success was cited as a factor in the jump by the head
of the Travel Industry Association, William Norman.

"There is an increased perception of safety, and that's very important," Norman
said. "It is a friendlier city now."

MINNEAPOLIS MAYORAL RACE;
CRIME DEBATE CALLED FOR

SECTION: EDITORIAL; Pg. 6A

LENGTH: 335 words


Minneapolis mayoral candidate Barbara Carlson may have deserved the charges of
opportunism and political grandstanding that were leveled at her during a Sunday
news conference in a crime-torn South Minneapolis neighborhood. But Carlson is
not wrong to direct attention to the crime issue.

In both Minneapolis and St. Paul, crime remains a central challenge to the
safety and quality of city life, above all in disadvantaged neighborhoods with
limited political clout.

It's true that crime statistics in both Twin Cities and across the nation have
generally been improving in recent years. But these are reductions from
historically lofty levels of crime. Local politicians become satisfied with
today's crime rates at their peril and the peril of their cities.

Carlson's central proposal to combat Minneapolis crime is to add 300 officers to
that city's 922-officer force. That's a costly remedy - more than $15 million a
year - of uncertain value. Yet the impressive crime shrinkage resulting from
more aggressive police work and more forceful social-service interventions with
wayward youths in places like Boston and New York suggest that bold anti-crime
initiatives can produce surprising successes.

Carlson's proposal sounds simplistic and pricey at this point. But voters would
benefit from a vigorous and detailed debate of anti-crime ideas between Carlson
and incumbent Minneapolis Mayor Sharon Sayles Belton. Anti-crime ideas also
should have a place in St. Paul elections.

There's no easy answer to crime. It is an issue easily manipulated to exploit
class and racial animosities. In some less troubled neighborhoods, perception is
worse than reality. All candidates have a responsibility to speak cautiously on
this issue and to promote concrete solutions to real challenges, not just vague
fears.

But crime is a legitimate issue. To residents of city neighborhoods where the
safety of one's family cannot be taken for granted, no other concern comes close
in importance.

HEROIN'S BACK & CRIME TAKES BREATHER

BYLINE: BY LINDA STASI

SECTION: News; Pg.  18

LENGTH: 712 words


CRIME IS down 17.2% in the city. That's spectacular, and due in large part to
top cop William Bratton.

Applause also has to go to Mayor Giuliani, who, in choosing to make crime the
priority, hired a take-no-prisoners commissioner.

While we're at it, put your hands together for former Mayor David Dinkins, as
well, for his Safe Streets/Safe City program, which put 5,000 additional cops on
the street by 1994.

While it explains a lot about why crime is down in the city, it doesn't explain
why crime is also down all over the country.

In fact, crime is down by at least 10% in eight of the top 10 crime-ridden
cities, including Miami; Los Angeles; Tallahassee, Fla.; Baton Rouge, La.;
Little Rock, Ark., and Jacksonville, Fla.; Pueblo, Colo., and New York,
according to the Heritage Foundation.

Violent crimes, in particular, are declining. Murder rates in Atlanta, Chicago
and New Orleans plummeted 17% between 1993 and 1994. In Houston, murder rates
declined 32% in the first half of 1995; rapes declined 21%.

What's going on? Maybe violent criminals are so busy appearing on trashy talk
shows during the day that they don't have time to rape, murder, pillage and
plunder. Or maybe former President George Bush's wish that we become a kinder,
gentler nation is coming true. Or maybe it's something else altogether.

According to Robert Stutman, former head of the Drug Enforcement Administration,
some of the drop in crime is due to declining use of crack and an increase in
the use of heroin.

"One of the off-shoots of crack is tremendous violence," Stutman said. "Crack
users tend to commit crimes against people; heroin users tend to commit crimes
against property."

More heroin, less violence.

So what happened to King Crack? And why is heroin now the drug of choice among
street users and Wall Streeters alike?

The change in the drug culture on the streets of the U.S. has something to do,
believe it or not, with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. That
invasion, plus a coup, and years of unrest in Afghanistan caused at least 6
million people to flee that country. The fleeing refugees included thousands and
thousands of poppy growers.

Fewer poppy growers equaled fewer poppies, which meant less heroin on the
streets.

Crack was cheaper, it was available, it didn't require needles.

AIDS, which could be transmitted via needle, was also on the rise. The practice
of sharing needles common among heroin addicts could in itself cause death.

In 1985, crack began its real ascent, according to Stutman. Crack could be
smoked, while street heroin wasn't pure enough at that stage to be inhaled.
"That made crack more attractive to drug users," he said.

"In the late '80s, the purity of heroin on the lower East Side in New York was
about 15%. In Harlem it was down to about 3%," Stutman maintained. That meant
heroin had to be injected.

"Three years ago, crack began to become less popular in drug inner circles,"
Stutman said. "The perception became that this was a bad thing. The same thing
happened in the 1970s with LSD."

The decrease in crack coincided with the return of the Afghani poppy growers,
whose yields can be now be found on the city's streets with those of their
up-and-coming competitors.

"The Colombians and Mexicans started to get into the heroin business," Stutman
said. "Both countries now have dealers growing and marketing it. The mob used to
control it; now it's changed."

Indeed. The heroin on the street has gone from 3% purity to 45% to 60% purity
pure enough to inhale. Pure enough that it doesn't need to be injected. Pure
enough to keep a user nodding out much longer for much less.

"Now that you don't have to inject it, it's become a tremendously more
attractive drug," said Stutman. "You get a lot more heroin in a $ 25 bag."

It's so attractive that even people whose crimes seem to be confined to
producing terrible movies are living in heroin heaven.

New York and Hollywood parties often now feature great big crystal bowls of the
stuff.

Tragically, the stigma attached to heroin use the drug for the dregs of society
isn't what it used to be.

In some places it's cool again to be fried.

It's a very high price to pay for less violence, though.

URBAN SPOTLIGHT Notes on cities Seizing guns cuts crime in Indianapolis

Indianapolis police are taking a novel but simple approach to getting guns off
the streets: They are going after them the same way they have gone after drunken
drivers and drugs.

Officers are freed from routine calls and sent to high-crime areas to watch for
any infractions of the law that will give them the legal justification they need
to search a car or a pedestrian for illegal guns.

The program, developed by a University of Maryland criminology professor, has
been in effect about a month, but it is already successful. Police have seized
some serious firepower, including an AK-47 rifle, a Glock 19 semi-automatic
pistol and several other weapons.

Police work "hot spots" where there are lots of emergency calls connected to
gun-related crimes.

Kansas City, Mo., participated in a slightly different version of the experiment
last year and reduced gun-related crimes by almost 50 percent in parts of the
city. Lawrence W. Sherman, the professor who designed the program, told The New
York Times that the number of homicides and drive-by shootings also declined.

PRIVATIZING DESEGREGATION: New Jersey education officials have tried for years
to come up with a way to integrate the city of Englewood's predominantly
minority school district with the predominantly white districts of its
neighboring communities.

Last week, they decided to give the job of devising an acceptable racial-balance
plan to a private company. Applied Data Services, of Flanders, N.J., was hired
to study the racial makeup of schools in Englewood and 19 nearby eastern Bergen
County towns, then produce several plans to redraw some or all of the 20
districts.

PROVIDENCE'S ABANDONED HOUSES: Movers and shakers in Rhode Island have decided
that getting buyers for abandoned houses in their capital city is worth the
financial risks of a new mortgage program designed to help low-income residents
become homeowners.

A real estate crash in the 1980s left Providence with 800 abandoned houses. The
hope is that the mortgage program will serve several good purposes: revitalize
sagging neighborhoods, create jobs in the housing trade and give people
previously locked out of the market a real chance at homeownership.

The program is sponsored by the quasi-public Rhode Island Housing and Mortgage
Finance Corp., several banks, a mortgage insurance company and a nonprofit
housing group.

To help high-risk applicants qualify for loans, credit and employment history
requirements are being relaxed, as are the typical standards dictating the
percentage of income borrowers can spend for a mortgage payment.

Buyers earning less than $ 26,000 a year are eligible for "silent second mortg
ages," which allow them to borrow some of the mortgage money without making
monthly payments on it until they sell or transfer the property.

BUSTED IN BOSTON: Two Boston men indicted by a federal grand jury on drug
charges have become the first in the nation to be charged under a new law that
doubles the penalties for selling drugs in or near public housing complexes.

Ruben Garo, 31, and Marta Cornelio, 27, were charged with selling crack cocaine
from their apartment in the city's Faneuil Housing Development and from a nearby
fast-food restaurant.

EXPERTS DOUBT HOW EFFECTIVE CRIME CRACKDOWNS HAVE BEEN CRIME RATES ARE GENERALLY
LOWER THAN THEY HAVE BEEN IN YEARS. THERE STILL IS GREAT POLITICAL PRESSURE TO
GET TOUGH.

BYLINE: David Hess, INQUIRER WASHINGTON BUREAU

SECTION: NATIONAL; Pg. A11

LENGTH: 871 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON


President Clinton and Congress agree - fighting the plague of crime is an
important national priority.

The problem is, presidents, Congress and state legislatures have been cracking
down on crime for the last 20 years with little to show for their efforts,
experts say.

Mandatory minimum sentences have been imposed for a wider array of felonies.
More and more prisoners are serving longer and longer terms. More and more
prisons are being built to handle the overflow. On any given day, almost a
million people are behind bars in America. Billions of dollars have been spent
to catch miscreants and keep them locked up.

But criminologists say the tougher laws have had only a marginal impact on crime
rates and crime prevention. They say that pending legislation in Congress and
state legislatures to mete out even harsher punishment and build more jails is
pouring money down the drain.

Despite such warnings, the massive $23 billion crime bill and companion
proposals now being considered by Congress call for more prisons, tougher
sentences for more crimes, 100,000 more police officers, mandatory life terms
for three-time felons and capital punishment for 52 offenses.

States proposing mandatory sentences for three-time felons include Alaska,
California, Florida, Kansas, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina,
Ohio and South Carolina.

White House sources said Clinton will press for a federal law calling for life
sentences for people convicted of three violent felonies.

Many criminologists say the three-time felon rule could be subject to abuse and
would be a waste of money, since few people commit serious crimes after age 40.

"What's happened is that a rational public discussion of crime is not
occurring," Frank Cullen, at the University of Cincinnati's Department of
Criminal Justice, said. "At every level, from Congress to the state
legislatures, there are lots of punitive policies being proposed without any - I
mean, any - consideration as to whether they can work or not. It's
irresponsible, but no political leader now, in this climate, can risk standing
up to it."

That climate is spawned by a widespread public perception that crime is getting
worse and that no one is safe in the home or place of work.

In a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll released last week, 93 percent of those
surveyed said dealing with crime should be Clinton's and Congress' top priority
this year, overtaking concerns over the economy and revamping the nation's
health-care system.

Yet, the official crime statistics, though registering sharp increases in
incidents of violent crime in certain urban neighborhoods, show that crime rates
generally are lower than they have been in years.

Although assaults have risen slightly, the homicide rate is down. And crimes
against property in the suburbs, where much of the pressure for tougher anti-
crime measures arises, are way down. Burglaries, for instance, are half what
they were 20 years ago - from 88 per 1,000 homes in 1973 to 44 in 1991.

"Everything we know about crime now is that it is not getting worse," said
Michael Tonry, of the University of Minnesota law school, "yet we also know that
everybody believes it's getting worse."

Most Americans, Tonry said, are quite safe. He blames the "disingenuous use of
crime by politicians" and "sensationalist news media" for fueling a
misperception.

Albert Altschuler, a criminal law expert at the University of Chicago law
school, said crime rates are driven mainly by demographics. If the population
has a larger proportion of young males, 16 to 23 years old, the rate goes up; if
not, it declines.

"Crime went up in the 1960s and '70s with the coming of age of the baby
boomers," Altschuler said, "and started down in the mid-'80s as the percentage
of 16- to 23-year-olds went down."

He predicted that rates would start up again around the turn of the century as
the children of the late-phase baby boomers reach that critical age bracket.

Clinton, an avid reader of opinion polls, is under heavy pressure from
congressional crime-fighters to strike an aggressive stance on the issue. Sens.
Bob Dole (R., Kan.) and Alfonse M. D'Amato (R., N.Y.) have challenged the
President to support even more stringent measures than those in the crime bill.

None of this, the criminologists say, should be construed to mean that crime is
not a serious problem. Nor that hardened, career, sociopathic and psychopathic
criminals should not be imprisoned.

"I'm not a fuzzy-minded liberal," protested Paul Gendreau, a leading authority
on criminal psychology at the University of New Brunswick in Canada. "People
who've committed serious and heinous crimes belong in jail for a long time. But
there are also many, many offenders locked up now who shouldn't be in jail."

And that is a key point in the criminologists' case against the punitive
legislation on the books now and in the works.

Most state prison systems are bulging at the seams, paying from $15,000 to
$30,000 a year to feed and house each prisoner, diverting public resources
from other programs when cheaper alternative forms of punishment are available -
some just as effective as long-term imprisonment.

District Led Nation In 1991 Homicide Rate;
Toll Was 80.6 Slayings Per 100,000 People

SECTION: METRO; PAGE D3

LENGTH: 375 words


The District continued to be the murder capital of the United States in 1991,
with 80.6 slayings per 100,000 people, according to the FBI's final 1991 Uniform
Crime Report. That rate is up 3.6 percent from the 77.8 homicides per 100,000
people in 1990.

District police scorn the statistical approach to homicides, refusing to provide
day-to-day comparisons between one year and another. But the homicide rate in
1992 appears to be running below 1991's, with 254 slayings by Aug. 4 of this
year compared with 280 by that date in 1991.

The rest of the Washington area, with more than five times the District's
population, had 237 slayings last year -- less than half the total for the
District.

The District's 1991 homicide figures reflected a national picture in which the
violent crime rate overall reached a record high last year of 758 violent crimes
for every 100,000 people. That was a 4 percent increase since 1990 and a 24
percent increase since 1987.

Handguns were used in slightly more than 80 percent of the District's 478
homicides last year, well above the national average of 53 percent. Shotguns
were used in two District slayings; knives or other cutting tools were used in
57.

The cities whose homicide rates ranked immediately below Washington's were, in
order, New Orleans, St. Louis, Detroit and Richmond.

Richmond had 116 homicides, or 56 for every 100,000 people. Baltimore had 304
slayings, for a rate of 40.6 for every 100,000 people.

Nationally, homicides reached an all-time high of 24,703 in 1991, a rate of
slightly less than 10 per 100,000 residents.

Of the major crimes that the FBI tracks for its crime index, there were 10,768
for every 100,000 people in the District in 1991, meaning there was an average
of more than one crime -- such as burglary, robbery, aggravated assault or motor
vehicle theft -- for every 10 people.

The crime-victim rate per 100,000 people in Virginia was 4,607, compared with
6,209 per 100,000 people in Maryland.

The biggest drop in the District's crime figures was for rape, which was down
28.3 percent. There were 214 rapes in 1991, compared with 303 in 1990, according
to the FBI.

Meanwhile, District burglaries were up 3.1 percent, but larcenies were down 3.8
percent.

The Nation: AK-47's, Battery Acid;
Dead Women Waiting: Who's Who on Death Row

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK

SECTION: Section 4; Page 1; Column 1; Week in Review Desk

LENGTH: 863 words

DATELINE: HOUSTON


ELEVEN are on death row for killing or arranging to kill their husbands, five
for murdering their children, and two for doing both. One killed two of her
grandchildren.

All together, 43 women, including one who used to be a man, are awaiting
execution in the United States, a small fraction of the 3,365 people currently
under a death sentence.

Women are much more likely to end up on death row for family-related murders.
That does not mean that the female method of murder has been any less hideous
than the male. Among the ways condemned women have killed in this country are
shooting with an AK-47, slicing with a box cutter, injecting with battery acid
and beating with a baseball bat. One drowned her paralyzed son by pushing him
off a canoe on a family outing, leaving him and his 50 pounds of metal leg
braces to sink to the bottom.

But women have not, typically, made headlines by actually getting put to death:
from 1962, when Elizabeth Ann Duncan was executed in California for hiring two
drifters to kill her son's pregnant wife, until last week, just one woman,
Margie Velma Barfield, had been executed. She was put to death in 1984 in North
Carolina, for lacing her fiance's beer and food with rat poison.

Last week, though, Karla Faye Tucker, a 38-year-old pert-looking pickax slayer
and born-again Christian, was executed in Huntsville, Tex., in a case that drew
an extraordinary amount of worldwide attention. It also drew fervent pleas for
mercy from an eclectic coalition of her advocates that included Bianca Jagger,
Pope John Paul II, the televangelist Pat Robertson, one of the jurors in her
case and the brother of one of her two victims.

Texas ignored those pleas and put Ms. Tucker to death. With the particular
debate over whether she should die thus rendered moot, and with two more women
scheduled to be executed in the next two and a half months, a new debate began.
Had the country passed some psychological threshold that augured an increase in
executions of women?

Many prosecutors sounded like feminists in arguing that the Tucker execution
signaled that women indeed had achieved equal rights in capital litigation, and
were being held just as accountable for their actions as men are. Not like in,
say, Russia, which has a death penalty but specifically exempts women. And many
death-penalty supporters also said they hoped the Tucker case reflected
stiffening public resolve to pick up the pace of executions in this country,
where only a small percentage of people sentenced to death receive the
punishment.

Opponents of capital punishment, meanwhile, insisted that Ms. Tucker's execution
was a hugely important moment in their cause. These advocates argued that Ms.
Tucker's numerous television appearances in the last days of her life made many
people feel they had gotten to know her. This, they said, had been a powerful
reminder that execution means the death of a human being who may be capable of
redemption, not a homicidal animal who is beyond hope.

"Her death will not be in vain for the abolitionist movement," said Ajamu
Baraka, regional director of Amnesty International. Still, he and other leaders
of that movement said they were troubled that the execution of a white woman had
drawn so much notice while many black men go to their deaths professing as
strong a devotion to their savior as she did.

Other death-penalty experts cautioned against reading any sort of national trend
into the Tucker execution and added that the scheduled executions of two women
in the coming months -- 54-year-old Judi Buenoano in Florida and Erica Sheppard,
24, in Texas -- could well be stayed through legal maneuvers.

"People are saying, 'Oh, there's a whole movement now, let's go ahead and
execute women,' but I don't think it's necessarily that," said Richard Dieter,
executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center in Washington. "This
train was coming down the track 10 years ago."

There is, of course, an argument over whether women, who commit roughly 1 in
every 10 homicides, have been disproportionately shielded from executions.
Victor L. Streib, dean of Ohio Northern University's College of Law, who
compiles the figures on convictions and executions of women in a semiannual
publication, "Capital Punishment of Female Offenders," says the answer is
obviously yes. "There is a gender bias in the process," he said, in which women
are "screened out at all levels of the system." But other experts argue that
women commit a tiny fraction of the kinds of murders that qualify for capital
punishment. Ms. Tucker acknowledged that her sex brought attention to her case,
but in her plea for clemency, she asked that it not be considered. "When we are
talking about the crime I committed, gender has no place as an issue," she wrote
to the Board of Pardons and Paroles. And speaking to a reporter in late
December, Ms. Tucker said of the death penalty, which she opposed: "If you
believe in it for one, you believe in it for everybody. If you don't believe in
it, don't believe in it for anybody."

In order of their time spent on death row, here are capsule profiles of the
women awaiting execution.

U.S. violent crime rises at record pace: Murder, robberies and assault all up
with Dallas, Detroit most dangerous

BYLINE: Steven Edwards, CanWest News Service

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A7

LENGTH: 320  words

DATELINE: NEW YORK


NEW YORK -- The United States became a more dangerous place in 2005, with more
murders, robberies and aggravated assaults leading the largest annual rise in
the violent crime rate since 2001, the FBI reported Monday.

The number of murder victims exceeded 16,900 while there were at least 92,837
forcible rapes and almost 420,000 robberies.

Among big U.S. cities, Dallas emerged as the most dangerous, with economically
depressed Detroit a close second, while New York again enjoyed being dubbed the
safest.

Experts differed on whether the statistics show the United States to be
significantly more dangerous than Canada, with one leading scholar arguing most
crime rates are similar except for homicide.

"The U.S. is higher in gun crime, but Canada has higher burglary rates, it has
higher theft rates, it has equivalent assault rates: It is a high crime
society," said Marcus Felson, professor at the School of Criminal Justice of
Rutgers University in Newark, N.J. "Western Canada is a very high crime society,
while Eastern Canada is moderate like New York, but that's partly for the wrong
reason, namely it is too cold in winter to commit much crime."

Statistics Canada will release Canada's 2005 crime statistics next month, but
annually warns against comparing them with the FBI list because the Canadian
roundup considers a greater number of violent offences.

The murder rate in the United States shot up 4.8 per cent last year, marking the
highest percentage increase in 15 years. The robbery rate rose 4.5 per cent, but
the number of forcible rapes reported dipped by 1.9 per cent.

The overall trend bucks a general decline throughout the 1990s, but individual
spikes are explainable.

For example, the arrival in Houston of thousands of people fleeing hurricane
Katrina-ravaged New Orleans -- long known as a high crime city -- could have
contributed to the 23 per cent rise in the Texas city's murder rate, to 334 from
272.

Jun. 1--Fayetteville led the state's largest cities in an increase in violent
crime last year, according to FBI figures released today.

Crimes including murder, rape, robbery and serious assault rose 22.8 percent in
the city in 2008, compared with 2007. That was the steepest increase among the
state's eight other cities with populations over 100,000.

The number of violent crimes dropped in four cities and rose in Raleigh and
Durham. Winston-Salem police statistics for 2007 were not available in the FBI
report.

Nationwide, the number of violent crimes dropped 2.5 percent. Property crimes
decreased by 1.6 percent.

The Fayetteville City Council has made combating crime a top priority this year.
Police Chief Tom Bergamine gave a report in April on wide-ranging goals of how
his department intends to address the issue.

The council is debating a new tax rate and police spending as part of a new
citywide budget that is up for a vote June 8.

Survey: Record drop in violent crime in 2000

BYLINE: Toni Locy

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 522 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON


WASHINGTON -- Americans experienced about 1 million fewer violent
crimes in 2000 than in 1999, a 15% change that is the largest
one-year drop since the Justice Department began its National
Crime Victimization Survey in 1973.

Nearly every demographic group reported being victimized less
frequently in 2000 than in 1999. The groups include males, females,
whites, blacks, Hispanics, and 12- to 24-year-olds, who historically
bear the brunt of crime not only as perpetrators but also as victims.


"It sounds like we should have a party," says James Alan Fox,
a criminal justice professor at Northeastern University in Boston.
"Maybe a little cheer is better, and I wouldn't cheer too loudly."

The survey provides further confirmation of a dramatic drop in
crime over the past eight years. But Fox and other experts caution
that it offers a different view than the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports,
the nation's main crime gauge.

The FBI's preliminary numbers for 2000 show a leveling off in
the crime decline, with signs of a slight uptick in certain parts
of the country. The FBI report covers violent offenses -- such
as murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault --reported to
police.

The victimization survey contains data on non-fatal crimes --
including attempted and completed offenses -- against people 12
or older that are reported or not reported to police. The information
was gathered through interviews with nearly 160,000 people.

The survey includes such crimes as purse snatchings that weren't
severe enough to call police but were counted because an interviewer
asked.

Fox says the FBI numbers are comparable to weather report temperatures,
while the survey is the wind chill factored in.

Lawrence Sherman, director of the Jerry Lee Center of Criminology
at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, says the survey
shows the effect of more people over 65 living in retirement homes
with security patrols.

Another reason for the decline captured in the survey, he says,
is that although the number of young people is rising, they make
up a smaller proportion of the population overall.

But, experts say, the survey shows trends in victimization.

"It does a good job of counting the percentage of the population
that has at least one crime victimization," Sherman says. Survey
highlights:

* Most victims of violent crime did not face an armed offender.
Rape and sexual assault victims were least likely to face an armed
offender; robbery victims were the most likely.

* People in the West and Midwest are victims of violent
crime at rates higher than residents of the Northeast and the
South.

* Property crime rates also fell 10% from 1999 to 2000,
mainly because of a decrease in theft and a slight drop in motor
vehicle theft.

Little solace in FBI report of crime decline

BYLINE: Sam Vincent Meddis

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 645 words


Reports of crime to police fell 5% in the first six months of 1993 - a
"positive" development but no cause to celebrate yet - the FBI says.

Among the findings from a study released Sunday:

Violent crime dropped 3% compared with the first six months of 1992.

Property crime fell 5%.

FBI Director Louis Freeh, while welcoming the declines, cautioned: "I doubt most
Americans will draw much comfort from them because the levels of violent crime
and drug trafficking remain so staggering."

A significant dark spot in the report was that homicides showed no change from
what many criminal justice experts call an epidemic level; there were 23,760
murders last year - 23% more than in 1983.

Otherwise, violent crime reports were consistently down the first six months of
1993:

Robbery, down 5%.

Forcible rape, -4%.

Aggravated assault, -1%.

The report also shows a drop in crime regionally - down 8% in the Northeast, 7%
in the Midwest, 4% in the South and 2% in the West.

Experts say the senselessness of the USA's crime - not just its high level -
causes most of the public's fear.

"I don't think the fear of crime is waning in any fashion," says Nolan Jones,
chief anti-crime specialist with the National Governors' Association. "It's
picking up, in fact."

Perhaps most troubling is the growing numbers of young people committing major
crimes, says Chuck Wexler of the Police Executive Research Forum, a group of
big-city police executives.
"Younger offenders and younger victims like we've never seen before," he says.

Moreover, this year's crime drops are minuscule compared with the spiral of
violence in recent years, says John Stein of the National Organization for
Victim Assistance. "Crime is still at a very high plateau."

Justice Department statistics released this year are grim:

The number of juveniles arrested for homicide soared 142% from 1983 through
1992.

The overall rate of violent crime reported to police nationally - about 562 per
100,000 people in 1982 - stood at nearly 758 a decade later.

Nearly 37 million people have been injured by criminals in the past 20 years;
crime cost the nation more than $ 19 billion in 1991 alone.

It may even be that declines in citizens' reports to police are not due to fewer
crimes but to a growing lack of confidence in the criminal justice system, says
Eric Sterling of the Criminal Justice Policy Foundation.

"If people are discouraged about the amount of crime in their community, they're
not going to report it," he says.

The public's growing fear of crime has helped propel the issue into the
political spotlight:

The long-stalled Brady bill, requiring a waiting period on handgun purchases,
recently was signed into law.

Chances are greater now that Congress will pass a new comprehensive crime bill
next year. Last month, the Senate approved a massive $ 22 billion anti-crime
package.

And first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton will target the USA's "sick, sick symptom"
of violence when the health-care crusade is behind her.

Experts say it's too soon to say whether the numbers out Sunday represent a real
trend toward a drop in crime or are simply fluctuations - like monthly changes
in unemployment or housing starts.

Whatever the case, the results are "great - except if you live in some of the
tough areas where you're afraid to go out and buy a carton of milk or go to
church," Wexler says.

Arson rate takes its largest drop

The USA's homicide rate remained steady the first six months of 1993 compared to
the first six months of 1992 - but reports of other crimes were down. How crime
rates changed:
Crime                 Change
Arson                 -15%
Burglary               -8%
Robbery                -5%
Vehicle theft          -5%
Larceny-theft          -4%
Forcible rape          -4%

Want a safe place to live with reasonable home prices?

Forget about Atlanta. Head north to safe cities like Pittsburgh or Cleveland,
which also hold the line on home prices.

In fact, Pennsylvania and Ohio placed the most cities in a survey by Century 21
Real Estate Corp., which compared FBI crime figures for 1989 (the most current
available) with recent home prices.

Beaver County, Pa., was the safest area among those with a population from
100,000 to 250,000, according to FBI figures, which included crimes against
people and property. The average price of an existing home there was a mere $
63,000 in October, Century 21 said.

Lancaster, Pa., was the safest area with a population between 250,000 and 1
million. The average home price there was $ 105,000.

Pittsburgh placed first among areas of more than 1 million people. And you could
buy an average home there for $ 71,000 in October.

As for Atlanta, it placed fifth worst among 38 heavily populated areas in the
FBI crime study. Its average home price in October: $ 88,000.; Safest big cities

Atlanta ranks fifth worst for crime among major metropolitan areas in the United
States.

Best Place to Live - Rodeo or Portal?

BYLINE: Hidalgo County Herald staff

LENGTH: 794  words


Most people take some pride in where they live, the popularity of the region or
at the very least, with the neighborhoods they are tied to. In Rodeo, New Mex.,
and in Portal., Ariz., residents, (in general) are mostly satisfied with their
environment and their overall place in the U.S. of A.

But you won't have to look far - for places to avoid. In fact, some of the
worst, most ' miserable' places to live in the U.S., are not far from home
places like Lubbock, Tex., Stockton, Calif., and Tallahassee, Flor., to name
just a few. In recent articles and credible data gathered by such news
organizations as Forbes Magazine and others, there are 10 miserable places to
live in the U.S. and others, 'kind of unpleasant' are beginning to develop.

While most of the study is based on such things as crime levels, annual weather
conditions, poverty, unemployment and the tax-base in place, you'll also find
that many such cities have come to be known as interstate-laced communities,
with signs of drug distribution, criminal activity and identified as well-known
'hubs' for drug-trafficking by law enforcement.

Most 'miserable' places to live like Fresno, Sacramento, Vallejo and Modesto,
Calif., also include rapid drops in house values, a nose dive in medium home
prices as well as high unemployment, and violent crime. Other places who made
'the unpopular' list this year are Bakersfield and Salinas, Calif.; with
Cleveland, Ohio, Miami-Palm Beach, Florida, and Memphis, Tenh., in Play-While
cold weather has always been a 'turn-off' for retirees and snow birds, it
appears that other trends in environment and neighborhoods are starting to
emerge. In fact, worse-case scenario towns with a high 'miserable' index - run
from the southern tip of Florida, along major interstates, up through Rockford,
Illinois and into Flint, Michigan.

Others are rooted in California and even, east into Phoenix, Arizona and Nevada.

In short, law enforcement are reporting interstates used as drug corridors,
which has produced rather unpleasant statistics for places like Tucson or
Phoenix. Weather is great there...but living, not so great. It's true that the
U.S. has always had locations preferred by tourists, out-of-towners and
home-buyers places like Disney World (Florida) and the Poconos, (Pennsylvania)
comes to mind.

But there are places on the radar in America that you might want to avoid, or at
least be aware of.

In Lubbock, Texas, there were 808 violent crimes per 100,000 residents last
year. Located in the Northwestern part of the state, Lubbock may be the
unfortunate casualty as a known transit hub for drug dealers - the scene of some
high profile cocaine and drug distributor activity combined with crime is the
result. Meanwhile, Stockton, Calif., gets some attention as another example of
unfortunate transit routes, bad behavior, and turf battles for territory.

In sunny Florida, the miserable index is likewise a problem. It can't be weather
- but crime stats show 775 violent crimes per 100,000 residents in an otherwise
attractive city. The Tallahassee police department is working on boosting funds
to interdict drug trade, but activity is moving north, along the interstates
with poverty and bad behavior becoming the norm. Meanwhile, the Midwest doesn't
escape the 'unpleasant' label with Minneapolis, Minn., Rock-ford, Illinois,
Atlanta, GA., and Memphis, Tenn., directly in the path.

While Rock-ford, admit; to 760 viclent crimes (per 100,000 residents) it's the
new National Incident-Based Reporting system that is keeping the most accurate,
but awkward records.

"Unfortunately, not every city wants to use that system, because it often
results in data exposing higher and (timely) crime rates," says J. Stults, an
expert on such lifestyle reports. (The results show) is that large interstate
highways have become popular routes for drug couriers and distribution networks
- and Rockford's proximity to Chicago (Illinois) has only made it more
attractive."

In Rodeo, you'll find little in the way of major crime statistics. Missing
people, suspicious deaths, kidnappings and the like, are generally investigated
by State of New Mexico authorities. And in Portal, crime data is microscopic in
comparison. Like some of the other cities high on the 'miserable' index - you
may want to think twice about visiting, let alone buying a home. Buyers beware.

While Phoenix, Ariz., may be known as the kidnapping capital of the U.S. -
second only to Mexico City, residents of Portal and Rodeo should be 'thanking
their lucky stars' for the neighborhoods, and valley they share. It seems we
don't live too close to the Interstate, drug trafficking is still kept at bay,
and people believe it's a pretty good place to live.

Other folks in the U.S. are not quite so fortunate.

Hopeful Signs on Juvenile Crime

SECTION: Section 1;  Page 18;  Column 1;  Editorial Desk

LENGTH: 407 words


For the first time in nearly a decade, there are encouraging signs that soaring
rates of juvenile crime may be tapering off. According to the latest data from
the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the homicide arrest rate for teen-agers
dropped in 1994 and 1995 and the overall rate of juvenile violent crime dropped
in 1995. While it is difficult to know whether this is only a blip or a
longer-term trend, the decline gives some experts hope that efforts to crack
down on guns and to prevent teen-agers from committing crimes are beginning to
work.

Epidemics of violent juvenile crime seem to come in cycles. There was a wave of
teen crime from 1968 to 1975, a leveling-off from 1976 to 1985 and another big
increase over the past decade, when the homicide arrest rate for youths aged 10
to 17 surged from 5.4 per 100,000 in 1984 to 14.5 in 1993. The latest F.B.I.
numbers show the youth homicide arrest rate falling for two years in a row, to
13.2 per 100,000 in 1994 and 11.2 per 100,000 in 1995.

Looking more broadly at all violent youth crime, there were 311 arrests for
robbery, assault, rape and murder per 100,000 youths aged 10 to 17 in 1987. The
rate peaked in 1994 at 527 and fell back slightly to 512 in 1995.

Many experts attribute much of the sharp rise in violent-crime rates in the
1980's to increased drug and gun activity, particularly among minority males in
inner cities. Police in cities like New York and Boston have now gotten smarter
about going after guns, and have escalated their efforts to take guns out of the
hands of teens with criminal records. One result is that Boston has not had one
juvenile victim of a gun homicide this year.

Other communities have been trying a variety of approaches, including curfews,
community policing, midnight basketball, peer mediation and conflict resolution
strategies and youth development programs. A key predictor of criminal behavior
is the initial age of involvement, and a recent Rand study concludes that it is
smart and cost-effective to invest in programs that prevent youngsters from
committing crimes in the first place.

The number of teen-agers in America is expected to increase by 1 percent each
year for the next 15 years. Thus, even if the juvenile crime rate remained
stable, the total number of crimes committed by youths would increase. That
makes it imperative to pursue more aggressive efforts to divert juveniles from a
life of crime.

U.S. CRIME LEVELS SHOW RISE IN 1987

LENGTH: 492 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 9


The nation's crime levels rose 1.8 percent last year, the Government reported
today, ending a five-year decline that the Reagan Administration had attributed
partly to vigorous law enforcement and tougher treatment of criminals.

People living in the West were the most likely to have been victims of crime
last year, while residents in the Northeast were the least likely to be
victimized, said the study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics.

Nationally, the number of personal crimes, a category that includes rape,
robbery, theft and assault and murder, rose last year by nearly 250,000, or 1.4
percent from 1986, to more than 19 million. Household crimes rose by nearly
360,000, or 2.3 percent, to 15.7 million, with increases in burglary, larceny
and motor vehicle theft.

The national crime survey was compiled by questioning some 93,000 people last
year in 46,000 homes. The survey found that about 37 percent of the crimes that
occurred were actually reported to the police in 1987, about the same percentage
as in 1986. The 37 percent figure is the highest ever and up 14 percentage
points from the figures for 1973, the survey's first year.

In determining that crime levels rose 1.8 percent in 1987, the bureau did not
distinguish between crimes reported to the authorities and those not reported.

In 1986, the number of crimes hit the lowest level in the 15-year history of the
government's national crime survey, 34.1 million.

Even with the increase, crime levels last year were 16 percent lower than in
1981, the peak year with 41.5 million crimes committed, said Joseph Bessette,
acting director of the bureau, a Justice Department agency.

Shrunken Crime-Prone Group

Administration officials have suggested that the decline in crime was due to
sterner law enforcement and a more cooperative public. Some academic experts
analyzing the data, however, have stressed that the size of the most crime-prone
age group, those in their mid to late teens, has shrunk in the 1980's.

The crime-prone age group will continue to decline in size until the early
1990's, demographers say, when it is anticipated by many experts that crime
levels will take a decisive turn upward once again.

Last year's slight crime increases probably suggest a greater concentration of
low-income groups at the young age levels ''where crime goes on,'' said Alfred
Blumstein, dean of the school of urban and public affairs at Carnegie-Mellon
University in Pittsburgh.

In 1987, the number of personal crimes per 1,000 people was 125 in the West, 101
in the Midwest, 91 in the South and 71 in the Northeast. The number of household
crimes was 223 in the West, 166 in the Midwest, 179 in the South and 116 in the
Northeast.

The West was the only region to show an increase in personal crime last year
over 1986, up 8.6 percent. In the South it fell by 4.8 percent, while the
Northeast and Midwest showed no significant change.

CRIME RATE DROPS IN STATE

LENGTH: 278 words


THE number of crimes reported in Connecticut in the first six months of this
year were down approximately 8 percent compared with figures for the same period
in 1981, according to figures released by the Federal Bureau of Investigation
last week.

Of the state's five largest cities, New Haven showed the largest decrease in
crimes reported, 20 percent over all, with the largest decreases in robbery and
burglary reports. Hartford's statistics remained virtually unchanged, with
11,616 crimes reported in the first six months of 1981 and 11,599 reported in
the first six months of 1982.

However, murder reports in Hartford dropped by 20 percent and robbery declined
by 28 percent. The statistical total reflects an increase in arson of 72
percent, and an increase of 9 percent in larceny theft.

While the bureau's Uniform Crime Report figures show 5 percent fewer crimes
reported nationwide, the Northeast showed a 9 percent decrease. The figures
represent a total index of various crimes, including murder, forcible rape,
robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny theft, motor vehicle theft and
arson.

In Bridgeport, total crimes dropped 10 percent, from 8,458 to 7,575 with
significant decreases in arson and burglary. In Stamford, they were down 10
percent, from 3,588 to 3,207, with reports of murder, motor vehicle theft and
robbery increasing. The crime rate in Waterbury was down 2 percent, from 3,495
to 3,401, with all categories down except for a 2 percent increase in larceny
theft.

Commentary: Back to basics of police work

SECTION: EDITORIAL; P-com Opinion; Pg. A14

LENGTH: 658 words


By Anthony Bradley

America has found itself at a crossroads, further embroiled in divisive tensions
between law enforcement officials and the local citizens they are sworn to
serve. The recent shooting deaths of Terence Crutcher in Tulsa, Okla., and Keith
Lamont Scott in Charlotte, N.C., have only further encumbered any chance of
reconciling the trust that has been lost between the two entities in cities and
towns across the nation.

Perhaps the most viable solution to this ongoing tragedy is to return to the
"old school" tactics of law enforcement.

A study released last week by the Washington-based nonprofit Police Foundation
proves that such solidarity can be achieved by convincing cops to park their
police cruisers and get back to patrolling the streets by foot.

The study examines the positive impacts of foot patrol programs in five cities
across the nation: Cambridge, Mass.; Evanston, Ill.; Kalamazoo, Mich.; New
Haven, Conn.; and Portland, Ore. - and the data found that such programs reduced
crime rates, improved the legitimacy of police forces, and ultimately
strengthened relationships between communities and local law enforcement
agencies.

The study concluded that foot patrol programs improved the relationship between
citizens and law enforcement, enhanced the ability of the police force to
enforce the law, changed how citizens viewed officers, and reduced both the fear
of crime and the number of violent crimes committed. Additionally, the data show
that foot patrols even have psychological benefits for officers, as they have
more opportunities for positive interaction with the local community.

Some outside studies quoted by the report have found that smaller communities
(like the ones examined in the Police Foundation report) benefit the most from
increased foot patrols.

In most of these cities, foot patrols create a better sense of approachability,
familiarity, and trust of officers among residents of the community, and in some
instances, cities reported higher levels of overall satisfaction with the police
from members of the community.

For example, a collaboration in Philadelphia between the police force and Temple
University's Department of Criminal Justice found that when they sent foot
patrols into the areas of the city with the highest crime rates, those rates
often fell as a result. After three months, the areas witnessed a 23 percent
decrease in violent crime and a prevention of 53 violent crimes.

If the outcome in Philadelphia is any indication of the success of these
policies, the Police Foundation report must be taken seriously. Bridging the
disconnect between police officers and citizens - who see themselves on the same
side of promoting human well-being - could certainly help ease the current
tensions, and, in a perfect world, even end them completely.

The future success of law enforcement nationwide rests on how well agents can
serve the communities they protect by keeping citizens safe and by fairly, yet
effectively, enforcing the rule of law. A return to tested and tried tactics
like foot patrols might be a small step, but it's certainly a step in the right
direction.

If we care about the common good of man and envision neighborhoods where
citizens can thrive and truly flourish alongside law enforcement, both entities
must trade in their escalating adversarial roles for mutually beneficial
partnerships and collaboration.

While the implementation of community policing may seem more expensive in the
short term, it is no more costly than the price cities and towns must pay to
rebuild businesses and homes that are destroyed or vandalized during outbreaks
of violent riots or social unrest.

Furthermore, as our nation has sadly come to realize all too well, no price can
ever be placed on the value of a human life.

Justice Department's Office of Justice Programs Awards Nearly $6 Million to
Project Safe Neighborhoods Program

LENGTH: 611  words

DATELINE: New York



 Washington: Office of Public Affairs Department of Justice has issued the
following news release:



  The Office of Justice Programs' Bureau of Justice Assistance today awarded
grants totaling $5.7 million to create safer neighborhoods through a sustained
reduction in gang violence and gun crime.  The awards are funded under the 2016
Violent Gang and Gun Crime Reduction (Project Safe Neighborhoods) Program.  The
goal of PSN is to create safer neighborhoods through a sustained reduction in
gang violence and gun crime.





 The program's effectiveness is based on a cooperative approach and unified
strategies led by the local U.S. Attorney, a collaborative PSN task force of
federal, state, and local law enforcement, community members, and other key
partners.  The partners work to implement gang crime and gun violence
enforcement, intervention, and prevention initiatives, using data and research
with a local research partner.



 "Gang violence and gun crime are two of the most formidable obstacles we face
in ensuring that every American lives in safe and secure communities," said
Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch. "These vital grants give jurisdictions the
resources they need to develop comprehensive, collaborative responses to the
most serious and destructive crimes.  By combining more effective enforcement
with closer cooperation, better data and expanded prevention initiatives,
Project Safe Neighborhoods helps communities make meaningful strides towards
ending violence, promoting peace, and restoring hope."



 "Although crime rates remain at historically low levels nationally, some
communities - and particularly, certain segments of those communities - continue
to struggle with gun crimes and gang violence," said Assistant Attorney General
Karol V. Mason. "The funding provided through Project Safe Neighborhoods gives
these jurisdictions the resources they need to improve outreach and education,
prosecute gun and gang cases, and restore peace to their streets and homes."



 This year's recipients of approximately $500,000 each include Black Family
Development, Inc. of Michigan;  the California Governor's Office of Emergency
Services; the Denver Police Department; City of Brookhaven, Georgia; the
Governor's Office of Crime Control Prevention in Maryland; the Ohio Office of
Criminal Justice Services; and Texas' Safe City Commission.  Awards of
approximately $300,000 went to the City of Greensboro, North Carolina; The
Justice Education Center, Inc. of Connecticut; the Wisconsin Department of
Justice; City of Columbia, South Carolina; and the Indiana Criminal Justice
Institute (two awards).  The City of Memphis, Tennessee, the City of Omaha,
Nebraska and Louisiana State University each received awards of $150,000.



 Each applicant addressed the required PSN design features in its application:
(1) Partnerships; (2) Strategic Planning, Crime Analysis, and Research
Integration; (3) Training; (4) Outreach; and (5) Accountability and Data-Driven
efforts.



 The Office of Justice Programs (OJP), headed by Assistant Attorney General
Karol V. Mason, provides federal leadership in developing the nation's capacity
to prevent and control crime, administer justice, and assist victims. OJP has
six bureaus and offices: the Bureau of Justice Assistance; the Bureau of Justice
Statistics; the National Institute of Justice; the Office of Juvenile Justice
and Delinquency Prevention; the Office for Victims of Crime, and the Office of
Sex Offender Sentencing, Monitoring, Apprehending, Registering, and Tracking
(SMART).

Richmond No. 9 on list of most dangerous cities

OAKLAND -- Oakland was ranked as the fourth most dangerous city in the United
States on Sunday by a controversial but closely watched private-research group
that publishes a list of the country's most dangerous cities annually. Nearby
Richmond came in at No. 9.

Oakland jumped four spots, from No. 8 last year, in this year's "City Crime
Rankings: Crime in Metropolitan America," which was published by CQ Press, a
unit of Congressional Quarterly Inc.

"Obviously, it's not something we can ignore," said City Council President
Ignacio De La Fuente. "I think that unfortunately, let's face it, we have not
been able to deal with some of the main sources of crime."

He said city officials did not do enough in the past 12 months to attack the
problem.

"I don't think we've done a very good job, collectively -- that's the mayor,
that's the chief of police and that's the council," he said. "We have increasing
crime in neighborhoods that have historically been safer than they are today."

Detroit earned the dubious title of most dangerous city in America. It was
followed by St. Louis and Flint, Mich.

After Oakland at No. 4. came Camden, N.J.; Birmingham, Ala.; North Charleston,
S.C.; Memphis, Tenn.; Richmond; and Cleveland.

Landing in the Top 10 in the 2007 rankings, which were based on the FBI's crime
data for 2006, is not shocking for Oakland.

"We don't need a poll to tell us that public safety is the No. 1 issue in the
hearts and minds of Oakland residents and the top priority for the mayor's
administration," said Paul Rose, a spokesman for Mayor Ron Dellums.

He attacked the credibility of the report.

"The FBI questions the use of the statistics, which forces many to question the
validity of such a poll," he said.

The FBI distanced itself from the report.

"These rough rankings provide no insight into the numerous variables that mold
crime in a particular town, city, county, state, or region," the FBI said in a
statement on its Web site. "Consequently, they lead to simplistic an/or
incomplete analyses that often create misleading perceptions adversely affecting
communities and their residents."

Indeed, criminologists and law enforcement officials across the country pan the
most dangerous cities list when it is published every year.

This year, the report looked at 378 cities with at least 75,000 people. Its
conclusions were based on per-capita rates for homicide, rape, robbery,
aggravated assault, burglary and auto theft.

Each crime category was considered separately and weighted based on its
seriousness, CQ Press said.

The report's findings were compiled by Kathleen O'Leary Morgan and Scott Morgan,
whose Morgan Quitno Press published the annual list until it was acquired by CQ
Press.

The details of the weighting system are kept secret.

The number of violent crimes increased slightly last year in some of the largest
East Bay cities, reflecting a national increase of about 2 percent, according to
FBI numbers released in September. Robbery increased in many cities, although
homicides, forcible rapes and aggravated assaults dropped or remained about the
same.

Richmond's 2007 homicide total is at least 24, including four since Oct. 9.
Police had investigated 34 homicides by mid-October last year. Richmond had
1,224 violent crimes last year, compared with 1,174 in 2005. Property crime was
down to 5,495 incidents from 5,808 in 2005.

Oakland police Chief Wayne Tucker said people might be misled by the report.

"The department is always interested in how we're being rated," he said, "but I
think a rating can be very deceptive and ultimately give a false impression."

He said being ranked fourth on the list of dangerous cities could easily lead
people to believe the whole city is under siege from crime.

Tucker said the reality is that crime is concentrated in "two reasonably small
areas" in East and West Oakland.

He said thus far in 2007, crime is up overall by about 2 percent, attributing
that to increases in residential burglaries and domestic violence.

Homicide is down this year compared with last. There have been 111 homicides
this year, compared with 134 at this point in 2006, when Oakland finished the
year with 148 killings.

Assault with a deadly weapon involving a firearm is also down this year, Tucker
said.

CRIME STATS SHOW APPLE AIN'T ROTTEN

BYLINE: TOM TOPOUSIS

"Virtually every city you can think of has, per capita, more crime than New
York."MAYOR GIULIANI New York continued its slide down the FBI's list of most
dangerous cities, falling to 160th - a far cry from its 114th-place ranking
three years ago, Mayor Giuliani announced yesterday.

Just last year, New York was ranked at 156 out of 201 U.S. cities with 100,000
or more people in per-capita crimes.

"Virtually every city you can think of has, per capita, more crime than New
York," Giuliani said.

New York was at the bottom of the list of the 25 most populous cities in the
nation.

"New York City clearly leads any other city in crime reduction. We're down about
41 percent over the last four years," said Giuliani, who credited the crime drop
with reviving the city's economy.

Topping the FBI list is Atlanta with 14,182 crimes per 100,000 residents last
year. The safest city was Thousand Oaks, Calif., with a crime rate of 1,964.

"It's amazing to think that we are safer in this city than in Boise, Idaho,"
said Police Commissioner Howard Safir. "And it's a real tribute to the support
of the mayor and the men and women of the department."

Boise Mayor Brent Coles took the comparison as a compliment because it means his
city has become a yardstick for public safety.

"You're comparing 350,000 crimes to 7,000. It's a chuckle," Coles said.

Boise, with 153,258 people, had a meager 7,856 crimes reported in 1997. That put
Idaho's state capital at 154 on the FBI list of crimes per capita.

New York had 355,893 crimes in 1997. But with a population of more than 7
million, the average number of crimes was 4,849 per 100,000 residents.

Crime in New York has fallen 9.5 percent this year, compared to the same period
last year. That's roughly double the national average.

Giuliani said cops are spending more time investigating fewer crimes.

"You have a much larger group of people focusing on a diminishing problem, which
probably assists in creating more of a reduction in that problem," Giuliani
said.

Plunge in crimes of violence

BYLINE: SIMON BECK in Washington

SECTION: Pg. 14

LENGTH: 294 words


City life in America is being transformed by a plunge in violent crime - a trend
that continued with a vengeance last year.

Murder rates dropped by double digit percentages in virtually every major urban
area in the country, and other violent crimes also plummeted.

Figures released at the weekend showed violent crime down three per cent in the
first six months of last year.

And nowhere is the dramatic trend seen as sharply as in New York City, where
murder and overall crime rates fell sharply to levels not seen since the 1960s.

Among large cities, only in Washington DC, Atlanta and Miami did the homicide
rate increase - cities that have largely failed to put into place the vigorous
policing changes which have reaped so many benefits in New York and elsewhere.

Helped by extra money from the White House for policing, most city governments
have increased the number of officers in crime blackspots, used computers to
target drug-plagued urban areas and worked with other agencies to reduce gang
activity.

But what is astonishing criminologists is that the downward trend seems to be
unremitting. Major crimes in New York, for example, have dropped more than 40
per cent since 1993.

"Something has changed on the street, and we don't know exactly what it is,"
said Jeffrey Fagan, a criminologist at Columbia University.

New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said: "It's really remarkable."

Another reason for the drop in urban crime is thought to be the declining
importance on the street of crack cocaine - the single biggest boost to the
massive rise in violence in the mid-1980s. Many of the 15 to 25 year-olds who
pedalled the drug have either been killed or ended up in jail, with courts now
imposing mandatory stiff sentences.

Homicide, rape, robbery: Numbers in decline But crime is rising among teens

BYLINE: Kevin V. Johnson

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 8A

LENGTH: 1350 words


Serious crime fell in 1995 for the fourth consecutive year, further
proof that the crime wave of the late 1980s has ebbed, at least
temporarily.

The FBI said Sunday that a preliminary report found that the number
of violent crimes reported to police declined 4% in 1995 compared
with 1994. Property crime fell 1%.

Overall, crime dropped in all but one category. Only larceny,
the least serious type of crime, rose. It inched up by 1%.


The most significant drops:

-- Homicide, -8%

-- Rape, -6%

-- Robbery, -7%

-- Assault, -3%

-- Burglary, -5%

-- Car theft, -6%

Crime fell the most in the nine largest cities. For example, homicides
fell 25% in New York to 1,170 and 11% in Chicago to 824.

The Clinton administration took credit for the decline, saying
its effort to put more police on the street was paying off.

"We will continue to put more cops on the beat, get guns off
the street and put violent criminals behind bars," U.S. Attorney
General Janet Reno said.

Police found good news even within the bad news.

New Orleans had the nation's highest reported homicide rate for
the second year in a row -- 73 per 100,000 residents in 1995.
But that city's 363 slayings in 1995 represent a 14% drop from
1994. And the decline appears to be continuing: the rate for the
first quarter of 1996 is 25% lower than the first quarter of 1995.

"We think we've made a lot of progress," New Orleans spokeswoman
Michele Moore said.

Some, though, fear that the decreases in violent crime may not
continue.

Criminologist James Fox of Northeastern University in Boston said
an explosion in teen-age crime will mean higher crime rates in
the future.

"We have two crime trends in this country," he said. "The good
news is crimes committed by adults are down. The bad news is crime
continues to rise among teen-agers."

Fox said homicides committed by adults declined 18% between 1990
and 1994, while slayings committed by 14- to 17-year-olds rose
22%.

"The bad news is that we have 39 million kids under 10 years
old now. They'll be teen-agers before you can say 'juvenile crime
wave.' If current trends persist, there will likely be a bloodbath
that will make 1995 look like the good old days."

The number of homicides reported in 1995 in the USA fell to about
21,400, about 8% fewer than the previous year. Local law enforcement
agencies voluntarily provide the FBI with crime data. USA TODAY
analyzed preliminary 1995 data for cities with populations of
more than 100,000 that reported data. The 25 cities with the highest

Clinton tries to put focus on violence

BYLINE: Adam Nagourney; Bill Nichols

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 1A

LENGTH: 1163 words


President Clinton said crime has exploded in the public consciousness because a
spate of high-profile violence has left Americans feeling "more vulnerable" -
even though the crime rate has inched down in the '90s.

The president, in a 40-minute Oval Office interview Tuesday devoted mostly to
crime issues, said voters are turning from a once-ailing economy to "what the
country as a whole is like," specifically violence in the streets.

Also driving the concern, he said, was a national wave of publicized, horrifying
crimes - such as the Polly Klaas murder-abduction in a small northern California
town.

"People see it as part of a serious decline in the social fabric in the inner
city and among young people - but they know it's spreading," Clinton said.

Asked about that perception, despite a 4% decline in crime rates, Clinton said,
"Small statistical variances don't register on people. They don't perceive that
they're safer."

Clinton also disclosed he had been a victim of two crimes 25 years ago. He said
the first time was when "my prized Selmer tenor saxophone" was stolen from his
locked Opel station wagon parked a mile from the U.S. Capitol.

The second was when an antique World War I sword, a gift from his stepfather,
was stolen from his Fayetteville, Ark., apartment when he was teaching law.

"Personal possessions don't mean a lot to me, but that meant a lot to me and I
lost it," he said.

He also said Hillary Rodham Clinton was "accosted once," referring to a
purse-snatching in Washington in the early 1970s.

Still, Clinton acknowledged his family has largely been shielded from crime
since they moved into public life with his election as Arkansas governor in
1978: "I've had a lot more security than the average American."

The USA TODAY interview came as Clinton steps up the pressure on Congress to act
on a crime bill - debated on the House floor today - and tries to turn attention
away from his problems with the Whitewater land deal.

When the questioning turned to Whitewater, an aide began gesturing in protest.

Clinton, who abruptly terminated an interview last week when it turned to the
topic, expressed no irritation this time.

In the course of the interview, Clinton, sipping a cup of coffee and wearing a
grey suit, starched white shirt and red patterned tie, made these points:
-- He disclosed he was considering some form of national gun buy-back program,
patterned after successful ones done in Los Angeles and New York. One condition:
any firearms bought back would be destroyed.
-- He pointedly declined to say he would require any Supreme Court nominee to
support the death penalty, in contrast to his strong suggestion that he would
insist any nominee support abortion rights.

"I think it's something I would take into consideration but, you know, I'm very
leery of litmus tests."

He also said he could not see dropping his support of the death penalty, when
asked about the late-in-life reversal on the topic by Supreme Court Justice
Harry Blackmun. Clinton said he argued both sides as a law student.

"I don't think that it's the answer to the crime problem . . . (but) I think it
is a weapon we ought to keep in our arsenal as a society."
-- He declined to endorse a proposal by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.,
for a tax on ammunition. Moynihan says an ammo tax would curb crime and raise
money to pay for national health care. Clinton said it would not raise enough to
cover the cost of national health care, and said he was unsure it would put a
dent in crime.
-- He predicted a crime bill - if passed and used correctly by authorities -
would 'dramatically reduce the crime rate." He favors provisions to put 100,000
police on the street, jail three-time offenders for life, and money for drug
treatment.

"I think you'll see a continued decline in the crime rate because we know more
police officers, properly employed, reduce crime," he said.

"We know that a very small percentage of people commit a significant percentage
of the truly horrible crime, which is the impetus behind 'three strikes and
you're out.'

"We know that proper alternatives to incarceration with follow-up - like
bootcamps with follow-up - help reduce crime."

Clinton was relaxed and engaged throughout the intereview.

He rejected the suggestion White House interest in crime reflected its emergence
in the polls, saying he had been fascinated by the topic as attorney general in
Arkansas in the 1970s.

He has, as a governor and as a centrist Democratic leader, always argued that
attention to crime is critical for Democrats interested in maintaining support
among middle-class voters.

At the same time, Clinton acknowledged a conflict between the perception and
reality of the crime situation. The crime rate dropped 4% from 1991 to 1992,
according to FBI statistics.

But Clinton noted public perception often lags behind such statistics. He
pointed to the election in New York City of Rudolph Giuliani for mayor, over
David Dinkins, despite a drop in the crime rate there under Dinkin's
stewardship.

"When Americans began to sense that the economy was going to improve, that
things were at least moving in the right direction, it gave the American people,
I think, some breathing space to think about what their country as a whole is
like," Clinton said.

"The rate of violent crime, especially among the young, is still very, very high
and you're right, it's not just confined to the inner cities - it's also found
in the suburbs, small towns and rural areas."

Clinton acknowledged there might be some differences between him and Attorney
General Janet Reno over the emphasis on crime vs. preventive measures. She has
emphasized family and community prevention while most publicity on the crime
bill has centered on policing and harsher sentencing.

On the question of the death penalty, Clinton acknowledged the misgivings
Blackmun had expressed about the death penalty. Clinton's position on the issue
has put him at odds with the liberal wing of the party.

"I thought very seriously about this issue over the course of a life-time, it's
an issue that when I was a younger man I did sort of go back and forth on. When
I was a teen-ager, in my 20s, I was not for it and I was for it again."

He said while some executions as governor had given him pause, "as a general
position I have not had doubts about my position."

Clinton acknowledged much of the furor over crime is the result of a frenzy
involving the press and, to a lesser extent, politicians. But he said it was, in
the long run, a good thing.

"I don't think the immediate conclusion would be, well, we've overblown this
because the crime rate is going down and people's concerns are going up. That
may not be true.

"It's still true it is by far the biggest crime rate of any advanced country in
the world, especially in areas of severe violence, so I think we should take
this as a very positive thing that people are so riveted on it."

As Crime Falls, Pressure Rises To Alter Data

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD

SECTION: Section A; Page 1; Column 1; National Desk

LENGTH: 1676 words

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, July 29


Senior police officials around the nation are concerned that the sharp drop in
crime in recent years has produced new pressure on police departments to show
ever-decreasing crime statistics and might be behind incidents in several cities
in which commanders have manipulated crime data.

So far this year, there have been charges of falsely reporting crime statistics
here, in New York, Atlanta and Boca Raton, Fla., resulting in the resignation or
demotion of high-ranking police commanders.

In Boca Raton, for example, a police captain, with the knowledge of the police
chief, systematically downgraded property crimes like burglaries to vandalism,
trespassing or missing property, reducing the city's felony rate by almost 11
percent in 1997.

Experts say they believe these incidents do not mean that the nationwide drop in
crime since 1992 is illusory.

But they are beginning to question whether politicians seeking office, the news
media and the public should attach so much importance to the annual, and
sometimes monthly, release of the latest crime figures.

In Philadelphia, the city has had to withdraw its crime figures from the
national system maintained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for 1996, 1997
and for at least the first half of 1998 because of underreporting and
downgrading crimes into less serious incidents and sloppiness.

Because of Philadelphia's size -- it accounts for 2 percent of all killings in
the United States -- the removal of its numbers could skew the crime rate for
the whole nation. But Harlan McEwan, a Deputy Assistant Director of the F.B.I.,
said he was confident the agency had statistical methods to adjust the national
rate even without Philadelphia's figures. The 1997 crime figures will be
published this fall.

The impact on Philadelphia will be more telling. "I can guarantee you my crime
is going to be way up this year," said John F. Timoney, who took over as
Philadelphia's Police Commissioner in March. "But I don't care. If we are going
to get this right and reduce crime, we have to start with accurate statistics."

Gil Kerlikowske, the former Police Commissioner of Buffalo, said the pressure on
police departments to prove their performance through reduced crime figures,
with promotions and pay raises increasingly dependent on good data, "creates a
new area for police corruption and ethics," along with the traditional problems
of brutality and payoffs.

Mr. Kerlikowske suggested that there had been too much focus on the eight major
crimes counted by the bureau in its crime index: the violent crimes of murder,
rape, robbery and aggravated assault along with the property crimes of burglary,
theft, car theft and arson.

"There is too little focus on lesser crimes, which are not counted by the
F.B.I.," Mr. Kerlikowske said, "like drug sales, prostitution and graffiti,
which are more meaningful to the overall quality of life because there is so
much more of them."

A common thread running through many of the incidences of police officials
altering crime statistics has been that police commanders have downgraded
felonies like aggravated assault and burglary, which are reported to the F.B.I.,
to misdemeanors like vandalism that are not reported to the bureau.

One of the first acts by Mr. Timoney, who was a career police officer in New
York, where he helped pioneer the city's highly regarded computerized crime
statistics system, was to set up a quality assurance division. It soon
discovered that serious crimes throughout Philadelphia were being underreported
by about 8 percent, he said in an interview. Much of this was the result of
"stupidity or carelessness and was not intentional," Mr. Timoney said.

But Mr. Timoney discovered this month that the youngest district commander in
the city, Capt. Daniel Castro, who had an excellent reputation for introducing
community policing and aggressively eliminating drug dealers from the streets,
had greatly exaggerated his reports of crime reduction.

Captain Castro reported an 80 percent drop in serious crime in his district over
the past year. But a review found that Captain Castro had downgraded many
robberies, burglaries and thefts to cases of "missing property." Captain Castro
was removed from his command.

In New York, Kenneth Donohue, the head of the police department's Transportation
Bureau, was forced to resign this year after Police Commissioner Howard Safir
said he had presided over the bureau at a time when commanders carried out an
elaborate scheme to reclassify incidents on the subway as street crimes. Mr.
Safir said the manipulation had gone on for years and had underestimated crime
in the subways by about 20 percent, but it had not affected New York City's
overall crime rate because the crimes had been shifted to the streets and were
reported by the regular precincts.

Problems have occurred at the precinct level as well. In 1996, the commander of
the 41st Precinct, which covers Hunts Point in the Bronx, was forced to resign
after he was charged with reclassifying a number of crimes as misdemeanors
instead of felonies in an effort to make the decline in crime in the precinct
more dramatic.

In the past, police officers here and in many other cities across the country
had not attached much importance to collecting crime statistics beyond the need
to report them to the F.B.I., Mr. Timoney said, and most commanders were more
interested in issues like narcotics, training or forestalling corruption.

This casual attitude toward statistics, Mr. Timoney said, also stemmed from a
"belief by the average police chief, in their heart of hearts, that they
couldn't do anything about crime because they couldn't affect the root causes of
crime." This was an idea that was popularized by academic criminologists in the
1970's and 1980's.

The success of New York in significantly reducing crime, with similar successes
in cities from Boston to Houston, changed that old-fashioned mindset, Mr.
Timoney said. Statistics have become as important a tool to the police as good
accounting is to corporate executives.

But the change to placing a premium on keeping accurate statistics in a big
police department is not easy. For years, the Philadelphia police counted crimes
not when they occurred, but when officers logged them into their records,
sometimes months later, meaning that some crimes that took place in one year
were not reported to the F.B.I. until the next year, throwing off the national
crime rate.

In Boca Raton, tips from low-level police officers led to an investigation by
the Palm Beach County State Attorney's office last month that found that Capt.
Jim Duke had systematically downgraded felonies, mostly property crimes, to
misdemeanors "for the direct purpose of not having to report these crimes" to
the F.B.I. In 1997, Captain Duke, who was later forced to resign, downgraded 385
felonies, 11 percent of the city's total of 3,635 serious crimes.

In most of the cases, Captain Duke personally reclassified the crimes by writing
supplemental reports claiming new information showed that they were not as
serious as originally recorded, according to the prosecutor's report. In one
instance, Captain Duke downgraded a home burglary to vandalism, though it had
occurred while the residents slept at 1 A.M. and someone broke in through a
kitchen window and stole a purse.

In another incident originally labeled a burglary, a thief stole $5,000 in
jewelry and did more than $25,000 in damage, the prosecutor said, but Captain
Duke also reclassified the case as vandalism.

The prosecutor's office found that the "prevailing philosophy" at the Boca Raton
Police Department regarding report classifications, from at least the level of
Captain Duke down to the officer on the beat, was that the reports "should be
classified at the lowest level possible."

The city's police chief, Peter Petracco, initially denied knowing about the
changes, but was also forced to resign after it was discovered he had lied, said
the city manager, Donna Dreska.

Debra Shannon, a spokeswoman for the Boca Raton Police Department, said the
motives of the two in manipulating the crime report were still unknown. The
prosecutor's investigation said the two had no criminal intent. An internal city
police investigation is continuing.

In Atlanta, the City Council and the Georgia Bureau of Investigation are
investigating accusations by a deputy police chief, Louis Arcangeli, that two
other deputy chiefs pressured detectives and officers to write off unsolved
crimes and misclassify violent crimes as nonviolent when preparing the city's
crime statistics for 1996, the year the Olympics took place there. In a series
of memorandums to Police Chief Beverly Harvard of Atlanta, Deputy Chief
Arcangeli warned that the number of crimes reported as "unfounded," or without
basis after an investigation, jumped 78 percent from 1995 to 1996.

Chief Harvard demoted Deputy Chief Arcangeli to captain after he wrote the
memorandums, which were leaked to journalists, though she has insisted his
demotion had nothing to do with the dispute.

Captain Arcangeli's lawyer, Bill McKenney, said the Atlanta Police Department's
crime reporting procedure created ample room for the problem. Unless a crime is
serious, like murder or rape, Mr. McKenney said, detectives do not investigate
it in person but instead send postcards to the victims.

Alfred Blumstein, a criminologist at Carnegie Mellon University, said one reason
to continue to have confidence in overall national crime figures reported by the
police to the F.B.I. is that the downward trend reported had been mirrored by
the country's other statistical program to measure crime, the National Crime
Victimization Survey. Begun in 1973 as a check on the F.B.I. data, it measures
crimes by a survey of 49,000 households.

The danger of sloppy reporting by the police, or outright fraud, is the reason
most criminologists focus on murders as the most accurate crime statistic,
Professor Blumstein said. It is hard to hide bodies.

Report pegs Oakland with country's 3rd highest crime rate; Richmond ranked 14th

BYLINE: By Kelly Rayburn Oakland Tribune

LENGTH: 460 words


OAKLAND   Oakland had the third highest crime rate in the United States in 2008,
according to a publishing company's annual report on crime in American cities.

CQ Press' widely followed but controversial rankings were released over the
weekend and put Oakland among the country's five highest-crime cities for the
third consecutive year.

Richmond ranked No. 14.

Oakland moved up two spots after ranking No. 5 in last year's report and No. 4
in 2007. Each year's report is based on crime data from the previous year.

Oakland's No. 3 ranking came despite a drop in crime of roughly 3 percent from
2007 to 2008   an indication other high-crime cities also saw declines.

What's not reflected in the report is that Oakland is experiencing a more
significant drop in crime this year. As of Nov. 11, reports of serious crime
were down 13 percent in 2009 compared to the same point in 2008, while homicides
had dropped by 17 percent.

Even with the drop, Oakland police Chief Anthony Batts, who began Oct. 19, has
repeatedly called the city's crime rate "unacceptable" and even "an outrage."

"The level of carnage that takes place in this city to me is abhorrent, is an
outrage in a city of this size," Batts said in a meeting with the Oakland
Tribune's editorial board Thursday. "My passion is trying to stop the level of
murders, homicides and deaths in this city if I possibly can."

The CQ Press rankings regularly draw fire from mayors and law-enforcement
officials across the country.

The U.S. Conference of Mayors last year ripped the report, calling it
"misleading and a disservice to the public."

The company relies on FBI statistics, and in 2007 the FBI itself attacked the
report, saying the "rough rankings provide no insight into the numerous
variables that mold crime in a particular town, city, county, state or region."

In a statement, CQ Press acknowledged the controversy but suggested criticisms
are "largely based on the fact that there are reasons for the differences in
crime rates, not that the rates are incompatible."

The report relies on six categories of crime: murder, rape, robbery, aggravated
assault, burglary and vehicle theft.

"The rankings tell an interesting and an important story regarding crime in the
United States," the company said.

"Annual rankings not only allow for comparisons among different states and
cities, but also enable leaders to track their communities' crime trends from
one year to the next."

Topping this year's list as the highest crime city was Camden, N.J. After Camden
were St. Louis, Oakland, Detroit, and Flint, Mich. Besides Oakland and Richmond,
the only California city in the top 35 was Compton at No. 12.

Richmond ranked No. 9 in each of the past two years before dropping to No. 14.

Violent Crimes on Rise, Especially in West, an F.B.I. Report Says

BYLINE: By RALPH BLUMENTHAL

SECTION: Section A; Column 1; National Desk; Pg. 28

LENGTH: 484 words

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Dec. 18


Driven by a surge in robberies, violent crimes nationwide rose 3.7 percent for
the first half of 2006, with the West leading the increase, the F.B.I. reported
Monday. But property crime was down 2.6 percent.

Robberies reported to the authorities were up 9.7 percent, murders were up 1.4
percent and arson was up 6.8 percent, the Federal Bureau of Investigation said
in its summary. Rape was largely unchanged.

Reflecting a surge in crime in Texas after the dislocations of Hurricane
Katrina, Houston recorded a sharp increase in homicides, to 202 for the first
half of 2006, up from 158 in the comparable prestorm period last year. Three
Texas cities ranked among the nation's top 10 in crimes per capita.

Homicides in Dallas were down to 101 from 106 but it still ranked as the
nation's most crime-ridden big city, with 3,985 overall crimes per 100,000
population, followed by Houston with 3,444. After Phoenix with 3,436, San
Antonio was 4th with 3,422. Los Angeles ranked 8th with 1,730, and New York was
10th with 1,187.

Lt. Vernon Hale, a spokesman for the Dallas Police Department, said the rankings
were subject to differences in how cities classified crimes, adding, ''We
overreport.'' Through November, he said, overall crime in Dallas compared with
last year was down nearly 10 percent, with violent crime down nearly 3 percent.
''We think things are getting better,'' Lieutenant Hale said.

In New York, where homicides were up to 266 from 238 last year, Paul J. Browne,
the chief police spokesman, said a dozen or more killings were actually
''reclassifications'' of old crimes that became homicides when the victims died
this year. Overall crime in the city was down 7 percent and violent crime down 3
percent for the first half of the year, Mr. Browne said.

The oldest and largest police chiefs' organization said the figures proved that
law enforcement agencies were stretched too thin.

''They all have new responsibilities since 9/11,'' said Gene Voegtlin,
legislative counsel for the group, the International Association of Chiefs of
Police, in Alexandria, Va. He said that since 1997, federal grants to local
police agencies had decreased to $890 million from $2.4 billion.

''There are some disturbing indications'' in the half-year figures, Mr. Voegtlin
said, but cautioned, ''It's hard to draw general conclusions.''

Violent crime for the period had been on a downward trend: 3.1 percent in 2003,
2 percent in 2004, and half a percent last year.

The West led the increase in violent crime, up 4.7 percent. Much of that was
driven by robbery, up 14.6 percent, nearly three times the increase in the
Northeast.

The Northeast had the smallest increase in violent crime, 2.9 percent. The South
led in homicides, up 3.3 percent.

Many cities showed increases in homicides: Miami was up to 30 from 23;
Indianapolis to 68 from 44; Boston to 37 from 29; and Detroit to 186 from 169.

Buchanan schools join student Crime Stoppers;
Teens can call to report problems

BYLINE: By ASHLEY LOWERY; Tribune Staff Writer

SECTION: LOCAL; Pg. C1

LENGTH: 580 words


BUCHANAN -- Buchanan High School senior Sabrina Patillo knows the Crime Stoppers
jingle.

She's heard South Bend Police Lt. Dave Shock tout the success of Crime Stoppers
on television advertisements.

And, starting today, she can become even more familiar with the organization as
her school becomes the newest member of the Crime Stoppers school program.

Students' familiarity with the program is one reason Buchanan Community Schools
officials chose to bring Crime Stoppers into the high school and middle school.

"This is just an extension of something they're already familiar with," Buchanan
Superintendent David Casey said.

Although the information given to Crime Stoppers is relayed to local police and
school officials, student Crime Stoppers works just like the traditional
organization. If a case is solved, an informer is eligible for a cash reward and
the hot line for reporting information is the exact same: (800) 342-STOP.

Since January, Berrien County Sheriff's Deputy Tina Morrow has been working to
introduce Crime Stoppers to Berrien County's youngest citizens.

"It's a number kids can get familiar with now and still use as adults," Morrow
said.

Students can report information on matters as minor as tennis shoe theft or as
serious as a classmate bringing a weapon to school, said Shock.

The reason for introducing Crime Stoppers to schools is the same reason police
founded Crime Stoppers in Albuquerque in 1976: to overcome citizen apathy while
protecting the anonymity of informers.

"It's designed to give students some control over their environment," Shock
said.

Unlike a school violence hot line set up by the Michigan State Police, student
Crime Stoppers deals with a more broad range of issues.

"There's a lot of other things going on in schools," Shock said.

Students need to have a place to go with concerns about issues big and small. In
addition, students can call Crime Stoppers regardless of whether the incident
happened at school.

After receiving the information from a Crime Stoppers representative, school
officials have the option of dealing with the matter internally or involving
police in more serious cases.

"That's the best thing about the program, that it's a program run by the
schools," Morrow said.

That was much of the reason bringing Crime Stoppers to Buchanan High School
appealed to Principal Bill McBeth.

"The more lines of communication we have, the better off we are," McBeth said.

Patillo and classmate Justin Kollar agree that Crime Stoppers will benefit their
school.

Kollar added, however, that he is concerned the program could be a means for
students to take revenge on one another.

"But I do think it has more pros than cons," he said. "I do think it's a good
idea."

Shock said he is pleased to see Crime Stoppers moving into more schools. The
program has been in South Bend, LaPorte and St. Joseph County (Mich.) schools
since 1994.

Already Upton Middle School in St. Joseph and Coloma Junior High School are
Crime Stoppers schools.

Shock will continue working with Morrow to expand the program in Berrien County
and is looking at introducing Crime Stoppers to Van Buren County schools in the
fall.

"The more opportunities we give students to have a means of sharing or
communicating anything they're concerned about is important," Casey said.

"It's just a win-win situation for us and the kids," McBeth said.

Our City Has Gotten Safer--Honest

SECTION: OP-ED; Pg. B08; CLOSE TO HOME

LENGTH: 450 words



Most people know that crime in New York City has declined dramatically in recent
years. But how many know that crime in Washington has fallen just as
dramatically?

Crime in the District fell 32 percent from 1993 to 1998, and in 1999 it dropped
an additional 14 percent, according to preliminary police figures. Thus crime in
the District has been nearly halved in the past six years.

Of more significance, violent crime--murder, rape, robbery and aggravated
assault--is down 60 percent. Remember the District's nickname of "murder
capital"? Well, the number of murders in the city has dropped from 454 in 1993
to 232 last year. Rape in the District has fallen more than 40 percent, while
aggravated assault and robbery are both down about 60 percent. Burglaries
declined almost 70 percent.

The District's precipitous drop in crime far exceeds the national average.
Across the country, crime fell 12 percent from 1993 to 1998, while crime in
Washington dropped 32 percent. The city's reduced crime rate also compares
favorably with crime-rate reduction in its suburbs of Montgomery, Prince
George's and Fairfax counties, where, during the same period of 1993 to 1998,
crime fell 4 percent, 5 percent and 7 percent, respectively.

Also, while violent crime declined 21 percent nationally, it dropped only 13
percent in Montgomery, 12 percent in Prince George's and 4 percent in Fairfax
County . All of these declines pale in comparison with the District's 47 percent
reduction in violent crime.

On the other hand, crime reductions in Arlington County (25 percent) and the
City of Alexandria (27 percent) more nearly resembled that in the District.
Violent crime also was down 27 percent in Arlington and 35 percent in
Alexandria.

What accounts for the significant reduction in crime in recent years? The
reasons are unclear but appear to include the robust economy, low unemployment,
fewer people in the younger-age categories that account for a disproportionate
share of crime, record high incarcerations and better policing strategies.

Other factors contributing to the District's reduced crime are the significant
decline in crack-cocaine trafficking and open-air drug markets, and the
demolition of more than 1,500 units of public housing, the site of much violent
crime. Of special note in this mix is the fact that the number of D.C. police
officers declined 20 percent during the city's dramatic reduction in crime, from
4,372 officers in 1993 to 3,488 at the end of October 1991.

Unlike New York City's, the District's damatic reduction in crime has not been
publicized. It needs to be.

Crime rates still unacceptable; start prevention at early age

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 22A

LENGTH: 399 words


The seven years of declining crime documented by this week's release
of the FBI's uniform crime report is a great thing, no doubt.

So why don't more Americans feel better about the nation's crime
picture now that rates are back to levels not seen since the 1970s?

As a USA TODAY special report on Friday disclosed, half of all
Americans still feel crime is on the upswing.

Some experts say the reason is the heavy emphasis by the media
on crime news and more violent television programming.


But there is a simpler explanation. Crime rates are still far
too high.

The fact that only 5% rather than 5.9% of the population reported
crimes to police last year versus 1991 provides only marginal
encouragement when one realizes that in 1960 less than 2% of the
population did so.

People still are nearly twice as likely now as then to be murdered,
nearly four times as likely to be victims of robbery and nearly
five times as likely to be victims of aggravated assault.

So, crime remains high, and authorities have few good answers
for it.

To bring crime back down to 1970s levels, the nation has done
everything it can to suppress crime. It's put more police on the
street to roust troublemakers before they can do much harm. Incarceration
rates are at all-time highs, as tougher sentencing has put a million
criminals behind bars. More than 40 states have made it easier
to lock away juvenile offenders.

Insofar as those measures keep crime in check, they are worth
it. Experts on the cost of crime say each victimization amounts
to an annual tax of $ 425 for every American -- $ 1,800 if you account
for victims' pain, suffering and disability.

But suppression is also expensive. It costs $ 20,000 a year to
incarcerate each criminal, and it costs $ 90,000 to equip, train
and pay each new police officer.

How much more of that can the USA afford? And what will happen
if crime resurges, as many demographers predict, because of baby
boomers' children reaching their most violent years? The biggest
burst of crime occurred in the 1960s and 1970s when the baby boomers
reached early adulthood.

The compelling need for society remains to find ways to prevent
crime. The best way to do that would be to keep kids from turning
bad. Until we learn how to and act on it, people have every reason
to feel uneasy about crime.

Tampa getting a bad rap, city says

BYLINE: MIKE MAHAN

SECTION: TAMPA BAY AND STATE; Pg. 1B

LENGTH: 719 words

DATELINE: TAMPA



Don't rush out and buy the Doberman and burglar bars just yet.

It's true that a published report Thursday citing FBI figures said Tampa  had
the third highest crime rate among U.S. cities with populations of more  than
250,000.

It's true that local television and radio stations picked up the story,  which
ranked Tampa as having a worse crime problem than places such as  Detroit,
Newark, N.J., and Washington, D.C.

But local police officials say statistics, like appearances, can be  deceiving.

"Someone took the FBI stats and threw them up in the air and when they hit  the
floor, Tampa came up No. 3," said an irate Steve Cole, spokesman for the  Tampa
Police Department. "A Jacksonville newspaper is saying Tampa is No. 3.
Conveniently, Jacksonville came out 22nd."

Jim Omohundro, an FBI writer and editor who helped prepare the 1992 Uniform
Crime Report upon which the Jacksonville newspaper report was based, said the
statistics are frequently misinterpreted.

"We do not rank cities," he said, cautioning against those who compare.  "We
tell them not to do it, but they do it anyway. Once we release the data,  we
have no control over how the figures are used."

The Florida Times-Union in Jacksonville on Thursday printed crime rankings  for
25 cities calculated by the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office. Miami had the
highest crime rate per 1,000 residents. Atlanta was No. 2 and Tampa No. 3, the
report said. Washington, D.C. ranked 15th; Chicago, 24th.

The rankings went out on the Associated Press wire to the broadcast media,
which resulted in a flurry of telephone calls to the beleaguered Cole. The
frustration level for the public information officer rose as reporters
repeatedly - and mistakenly - insisted that the ranking was made by the FBI.

"No one is denying there's a crime problem in Tampa," Cole said. "There  is. But
crime is down in Tampa, not up."

Tampa officials say the city's high number of vehicle thefts - the only  major
crime category that increased in Tampa last year - served to skew the  crime
rate in the Jacksonville report and make the city look worse than it is.

Chuck Alsobrook, who works in the Planning Division of the Jacksonville
Sheriff's Office, defended his department's analysis, saying the findings came
directly from statistics compiled in the FBI's annual Uniform Crime Report.

Here's how they came up with Tampa's dismal rating:

Jacksonville took the total number of reported crimes in Tampa, including
property crimes such as burglary, larceny and car theft, and violent crimes,
such as homicide and rape, and divided them by the city's population. The
result was a crime rate of 158 crimes per 1,000 residents.

A different picture develops, however, when statistics for particular crime
categories are analyzed.

Tampa's 1992 homicide rate, for example, of .168 per 1,000 residents, puts  it
behind the homicide rates of Washington, D.C. (.752), Jacksonville (.185),
Chicago (.331), Detroit (.570) and Charlotte, N.C. (.242), all of which ranked
below Tampa in overall crime rate in the Jacksonville study.

On the other hand, Tampa has a high rate of car theft, 25.14, far higher  than
Washington and Chicago, and only slightly less than Detroit. Tampa's  robbery
rate, 10.27, is almost twice that of Jacksonville, but still is lower  than
Washington, Detroit and Chicago.

Cole cited figures compiled by the department for the first six months of  this
year that reflect a drop in all violent crime categories. Murder is down  13.6
percent, rape fell 26.5 percent and aggravated assault declined by 11  percent,
according to the figures. Property crimes also were down, with the  exception of
car theft, which has jumped 20.5 percent so far.

Tampa Mayor Sandy Freedman said she heard of the crime rankings on her way  to
work Thursday.

"I won't say what I said because I knew they were wrong," Freedman said.  City
officials worked to re-check the numbers Thursday, confirming what  Freedman
already knew.

"We just hope that people haven't gotten too worked up about it because
somebody in Jacksonville got enterprising about putting a different spin on  the
numbers," Freedman said.

CITY CRIME DOWN 7 PCT., FBI SAYS; MURDERS NATIONWIDE ALSO SHOW DECREASE

Crime levels in St. Louis dropped by more than 7 percent in 1992 - a figure that
local authorities call encouraging.  The FBI's Uniform Crime Report, released
Sunday, shows that St. Louis recorded fewer murders, robberies, assaults and
thefts in 1992 than in 1991.  In 1992, 231 people were murdered in the city,
compared with 260 in 1991.  "It's encouraging, and we hope it would be a trend.
It's hard to tell, especially with homicide," said Lt. Col. Charles McCrary of
the St. Louis Police Department.  McCrary said St. Louis police have adopted a
problem-solving philosophy in recent years, adding numerous programs in
communities to help curb crime.  Scott H. Decker, chairman of the Department of
Criminology and Criminal Justice at the University of Missouri at St. Louis,
echoed McCrary's words and his cautious optimism.  "Any decline in crime is
good, especially if it is in the right areas, such as violent crimes," Decker
said Sunday night. "A decline of 7 percent in violent crime and murder is an
important decline. The challenge is to keep the numbers moving in that
direction." The preliminary report showed St. Louis, Kansas City, and
Independence all had a lower total crime index, a measure of serious crimes
including violent and property offenses.  In Illinois, the number of murders
reported in Chicago rose last year, but other violent and property crimes fell
from 1991 totals, the report said.  Those crimes generally increased in
Illinois' other cities with more than 100,000 people - such as Peoria, Rockford
and Springfield - but killings remained almost level. The report indicated that
the national crime index was 4 percent lower in 1992 than in 1991. Violent
crimes, including murder, rape, robbery and assault were down 1 percent.  This
is the first time in nine years that the national index has declined.  The
number of murders last year dropped 6 percent, although total violent crimes
remained steady, with increases in rapes and assaults.  Given the 1991 murder
total of 24,703, a 6 percent decrease would mean that about 23,220 people were
victims of homicides nationwide last year. That's about 1,480 fewer than last
year, and about 200 fewer than the year before.  A 2 percent increase in
forcible rape would mean about 108,730 victims, while the same increase in
aggravated assault would reflect about 1,114,600 victims.  The FBI's preliminary
findings on its Uniform Crime Report include only percentages of changes, not
totals for the year. The totals were calculated by The Associated Press.

CRIME'S INFLUENCE OUTLINED TO JURY

BYLINE: By WILLIAM ROBBINS, Special to the New York Times

SECTION: Section 1; Part 1, Page 33, Column 1; National Desk

LENGTH: 906 words

DATELINE: KANSAS CITY, Mo., Nov. 9


The face of the slender witness was devoid of expression, and the words came in
a low monotone, but his testimony held the rapt attention of jurors in a Federal
courtroom here this week.

He had been warned by a criminal syndicate, he said, that unless he followed
instructions ''my sons would be killed one by one.''

The witness, Allen R. Glick, was the second person in a trial here of eight men
reputed to be leaders of organized crime from four cities to give testimony that
prosecutors say is unparalleled. They said it was the first time a casino owner
had told how a crime syndicate was able control his gambling operation. The
defendants are accused of taking casino gambling profits that were not reported
to the Government.

Mr. Glick, an investor who began buying casino-hotels in Las Vegas in the 1970's
after making a fortune in San Diego real estate, told the jury that the criminal
syndicate held him in thrall for five years with murder threats.

Earlier, Roy L. Williams, who was president of the teamsters before his
conviction in 1982 on a charge of attempting to bribe a United States Senator,
testified that he had followed instructions from a reputed leader of Kansas
City's criminal organization in approving a loan from a teamsters' pension fund
for Mr. Glick. The loan enabled him to buy two of the four casino-hotels he
eventually operated.

Prosectuors said Mrs. Williams was the first executive in the teamsters' union
to acknowledge he had taken directions from a criminal organization.

An Attack on Organized Crime

The case being tried here is one of several Federal moves under way in the
United States against organized criminal factions in what one prosecutor this
week called the ''broadest national attack against organized crime that this
country has ever seen.''

The chief prosecutor in the trial here, David B. B. Helfrey of the Justice
Department's Organized Crime Strike Force, has declined to comment.

While cases either on trial or pending in the New York area involve five
purported crime ''families'' on charges ranging from car thefts to murder to
international narcotics trafficking, and a Boston case deals with a similar
array of allegations, the case here, geographically, is the widest of all. It
involves operations in five Middle Western cities as well as Las Vegas and
stretches from Wisconsin to Nevada.

One prosecutor said he agreed with a recent remark by Rudolph W. Giuliani, the
United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York. ''We're not going
to end crime,'' Mr. Giuliani said, ''but I think it's realistic to expect that
we can crush the Mafia.''

Crime Families Weakened

The organized crime families in Kansas City, Milwaukee and Cleveland have
already been weakened by the case here and earlier ones, which law-enforcement
officials say have greatly reduced the flow of Nevada gambling money into crime.
The biggest and strongest target now, ''probably as strong as all five of New
York's famillies,'' is the Chicago organization, said one prosecution expert.

''And this case,'' said an independent expert, ''is the keystone of the
Government's effort to wipe out the foothold organized crime has had almost from
the beginning in Las Vegas.''

Of the Kansas City residents who have been named in the case, the most feared
was the reputed leader of the local syndicate, Nick Civella, who died in 1983.
His brother, Carl Civella, who pleaded guilty in the case, is in prison on an
earlier conviction.

The remaining Kansas City figure in the case, Carl DeLuna, a reputed lieutenant
to the Civellas, who was already serving a long prison term, pleaded guilty this
week.

Of the eight still on trial, Frank Balistrieri, the reputed leader of the
Milwaukee crime syndicate, is serving a prison term. Others on trial include
Joseph John Aiuppa, the reputed Chicago leader; John Peter Cerone, his reputed
chief lieutenant, and Milton John Rockman, who is said to hold a high rank in
the Cleveland organization.

Others on trial are Mr. Balistrieri's sons, Joseph and John, both lawyers, and
two reputed members of the Chicago organization, Joseph Lombardo and Angelo
LaPietra.

In addition to Carl Civella and Mr. DeLuna, three others have pleaded guilty,
and two additional defendants face separate trials. $1,500 Monthly Payments The
testimony of the latest witnesses was the highlight so far of a trial that began
in late September. Together they summarized the case the prosecutors are
attempting to make.

Mr. Williams told the court that he had accepted regular monthly payments of
$1,500 from Nick Civella. Mr. Williams said he started receiving the money after
voting to approve a $62.5 million loan from a teamster pension fund to finance
Mr. Glick's purchase of two casino-hotels, the Stardust and the Fremont. Mr.
Williams was one of eight trustees for fund.

The purchase gave Mr. Glick's company, the Argent Corporation, nominal control
of four hotels-casinos, including the Hacienda and the Marina.

When he sought the loan, Mr. Glick testified, he was told by still another
trustee of the fund, Frank Ranney, to see Frank Balistrieri. After approval of
the loan, the criminal syndicate placed its own people in control of his
casinos, Mr. Glick said.

The threat to his children came in 1978, Mr. Glick said, when he was ordered by
Mr. DeLuna to sell his casinos. Two months later he announced that he would. In
1979, he did.

CARL M. LOEB JR. DEAD AT 81; FOUNDER OF ANTICRIME GROUP

BYLINE: By GEORGE JAMES

SECTION: Section B; Page 8, Column 4; Metropolitan Desk

LENGTH: 396 words


Carl M. Loeb Jr., a prominent businessman and a founder of the National Crime
Prevention Council, died yesterday at Greenwich (Conn.) Hospital after suffering
a stroke. He was 81 years old.

Mr. Loeb moved to La Quinta, Calif., several years ago but continued to maintain
a summer home in Greenwich.

Mr. Loeb joined the Climax Molybdenum Company, which later became AMAX Inc., in
1932. He served as a vice president from 1937 until his retirement in 1954. He
was a director and, from 1960, a member of the executive committee until his
death.

He was also a limited partner in Loeb, Rhoades & Company, a brokerage and
investment banking firm his father, Carl, had helped found, and which became
part of the company now known as Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.

A Reagan Choice for Panel

Mr. Loeb, a former vice chairman of the board of the National Council on Crime
and Delinquency, left that group in 1981 to help found the National Crime
Prevention Council in 1982 and serve as its chairman. The Washington-based
agency works closely with the Justice Department and the Advertising Council and
uses as its ''spokesman'' a husky brown dog named McGruff that advises people to
''Take a bite out of crime.''

A son of Mr. Loeb, Peter, said President Reagan last week asked his father to
serve on a new commission, the President's Child Safety Partnership.

''Perhaps his major interest was the plight of the average individual as a
victim of crime,'' Peter Loeb said.

Former Correction Official

Former Mayor Robert F. Wagner appointed Mr. Loeb chairman of the first City
Board of Correction in 1957. He served as president of the Community Council of
Greater New York from the early 1950's to the early 1960's.

He was also a former officer of the National Jewish Welfare Board, a former
director of the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies, and a trustee of the Day
Care and Child Development Council of America.

Mr. Loeb received a bachelor's degree in 1926 from Princeton University, where
he was an All-American basketball player. He earned a master's degree in
metallurgical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in
1928.

In addition to his son Peter, of New York City, Mr. Loeb is survived by his
wife, Lucille, of La Quinta; a daughter, Constance Cohn of Seattle; another son,
Carl M. 3d of New York City, and nine grandchildren.

STUDY STRESSES LINK BETWEEN HEROIN DEPENDENCE AND INCIDENCE OF CRIME

BYLINE: Special to the New York Times

SECTION: Section 1; Part 1; Page 22, Column 3; National Desk

LENGTH: 750 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 21


Recent research shows that the link between crime and heroin addiction is closer
than previously suspected.  Researchers found that the incidence of crime rose
sharply in periods of addiction and fell dramatically in periods of abstinence
or minimal drug use.

The federally financed study, to be published later this year, found that 237
addicts were responsible for committing more than 500,000 crimes in an 11-year
period.

But ''addiction was not a continuous state of drug dependency,'' according to
the study. When addicts were not dependent on heroin, their crime rate was 84
percent lower than when they were regularly using the drug.

For more than a decade there has been rather general agreement among experts
that an increase in criminality tended to follow the onset of heroin addiction.
The latest study measures the activity of addicts in a new way, showing how much
they steal day by day to support their drug habit.

Temple and Maryland Authors

The authors of the study were Dr. John C. Ball, Dr. Lawrence Rosen and Dr. John
A. Flueck, all of Temple University in Philadelphia, and Dr. David N. Nurco of
the University of Maryland School of Medicine.

In an interview, Dr. Ball, a former president of the American Society of
Criminology, said he was surprised both by the ''sheer volume of crime'' for
which the addicts were responsible and by the marked difference in crime rates
for an addict while ''on'' and ''off'' drugs.

Ronald L. Gainer, a lawyer who is a researcher at the Justice Department, and
Dr. Dan J. Lettieri, chief of psychological research at the National Institute
on Drug Abuse, said yesterday that the Temple University study was significant
because it demonstrated the correlation between heroin use and the incidence of
crime with more sophistication than previous studies.

Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., a Delaware Democrat who has closely followed
Federal drug programs, said the new study strongly supported the theory that
Southwest Asian heroin, now streaming into the United States, contributed to
recent increases in property crime rates in East Coast cities. He warned that
budget cuts proposed for the Drug Enforcement Administration and for federally
financed drug treatment programs would exacerbate the problem.

Measurement of 'Crime-Days'

Dr. Ball and his colleagues, finding that criminal activity of addicts far
exceeded the number of arrests, measured such behavior in terms of ''crime-days
per year.'' A crime-day was defined as a 24-hour period in which a person
committed one or more crimes. Most of the addicts, by their own admission, were
''deeply enmeshed in a criminal way of life,'' committing crimes on a daily
basis in their years on the street, the report said.

The addicts in the study were a random sample of those arrested by the Baltimore
Police Department from 1952 to 1971. The crime data came from three-hour
interviews conducted by trained interviewers with virtually all the addicts.

In an earlier study, Dr. Nurco found that addicts generally told the truth in
such interviews, at least insofar as their accounts could be checked against
official police and court records.

Dr. Ball and his collegues concluded that heroin use itself was ''the principal
cause of high crime rates among addicts.'' Thus, they said, ''if we can control
addiction, it is evident that we will reduce criminality appreciably.''

Few Arrests Are Found

Other recent studies, notably one by Dr. James A. Inciardi of the University of
Delaware, have found that less than 1 percent of the crimes committed by addicts
resulted in arrests by the police.

The National Institute on Drug Abuse and other Federal agencies have estimated
that there are fewer than 400,000 heroin addicts in the United States, but some
researchers say that figure is much too low.

Dr. Nurco said the addicts he studied in Baltimore had become ''more violent and
vicious'' in the 1970's than they were in the two previous decades.

There had been a common belief that addicts committed burglaries and other
property crimes but generally avoided crimes with a potential for violence while
they were regularly using heroin.  However, in a recent survey, Dr. Nurco found
that 40 percent of the Baltimore addicts were carrying weapons when they engaged
in crimes.

Lancaster County rated 44th-safest community

DATELINE: Lancaster, PA


Staff and wire reports

Lancaster County remains an exceptionally safe place to live, a crime-data study
released Sunday says.

The county is the 44th-safest community in America, with a crime rate well below
the national average, according to the study.

The 14th-annual "City Crime Rankings: Crime in Metropolitan America" was
published by CQ Press, a unit of Congressional Quarterly Inc.

Its rankings of 333 metropolitan areas are based on the FBI's Sept. 24 crime
statistics report.

At the other end of the spectrum, Detroit pushed past St. Louis to become the
nation's most dangerous city.

While Lancaster County ranked very favorably, it did slip somewhat. The county
was named 18th-safest in 2006 and 26th safest in 2005.

Other Pennsylvania metropolitan areas fared well too.

State College was found to be the third-safest metro area in the nation,
trailing only second place Eau Claire, Wis., and top ranked Logan, Utah.

Williamsport was found to be 17th safest, Johnstown, 32nd,
Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, 59th, Erie, 68th, Harrisburg/Carlisle, 70th, Altoona,
71st, Lebanon, 74th, and Pittsburgh, 95th.

But the study has its critics.

The American Society of Criminology launched a pre-emptive strike Friday,
issuing a statement attacking the study as "an irresponsible misuse" of crime
data.

Detroit police officials released a statement Sunday night disputing the report,
saying it fails to put crime information into proper context.

"Every year this organization sends out a press release with big, bold lettering
that labels a certain city as Most Dangerous, USA," Police Chief Ella
Bully-Cummings said in the release.

"It really makes you wonder if the organization is truly concerned with
evaluating crime or increasing their profit," said Bully-Cummings, who noted the
complete report is available only by purchase.

The report examines per-capita rates for homicide, rape, robbery, aggravated
assault, burglary and auto theft. Each crime category was considered separately
and weighted based on its seriousness, CQ Press said.

The data was compiled by Kathleen O'Leary Morgan and Scott Morgan, whose Morgan
Quitno Press published the report annually until their firm was bought by CQ
Press.

Critics of the report said it does needless harm to the communities deemed
dangerous and complained that numbers don't tell the whole story because of
differences among cities.

"You're not comparing apples and oranges; you're comparing watermelons and
grapes," said Rob Casey, who heads the FBI section that puts out the Uniform
Crime Report, which provides the data for the CQ Press report.

The FBI posted a statement on its Web site criticizing such use of its
statistics.

Doug Goldenberg-Hart, acquisitions editor at CQ Press, said that the rankings
are imperfect, but that the numbers are straightforward. Cities at the top of
the list would not be there unless they ranked poorly in all six crime
categories, he said.

Much work to do in Michigan

SECTION: LOCAL; Pg. B4; OUR OPINION

LENGTH: 397 words


Those who single out others for victimization because they are different are
disturbed and cowardly. Their conduct must never be tolerated by a civilized
society.

The worst periods in human history occurred because bigotry-based hatred had
found acceptance in the general population. Humanity is profoundly diminished
when society turns a blind eye to crimes that are motivated by bigotry.

It is especially upsetting, then, to hear that the number of hate crimes appears
to be on the rise, and especially in Michigan. Data released recently by the
FBI, the U.S. Attorney's Office and the Michigan Civil Rights Commission are
sobering.

There were 556 hate crimes reported in Michigan last year, which was a
30-percent increase over 2003. That number means that Michigan ranks third
highest in the nation in the number of reported hate crimes.

Only New Jersey and California outpace Michigan. Michigan residents reported
more hate crimes than Florida, Illinois, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania or Texas
-- all of which have larger populations. New York and Texas have about twice as
many people as Michigan.

The special agent in charge of the Detroit office of the FBI indicated that
better reporting by local police agencies could be a factor in the increase. He
was joined by the U.S. attorney for the district in stressing that all hate
crimes will be investigated and prosecuted.

Neither man could explain the startling rise in reports between 2003 and 2004.
Nor could Michigan Civil Rights Commission Director Linda Parker. She said hate
crime reports spiked to an alarming level over the summer. About two-thirds were
motivated by racial bias. Parker described Michigan as among the most segregated
states in the nation and noted that is a factor in racial intolerance.

Michigan only recently has begun tracking hate crime complaints and law
enforcement responses, so the data are not complete. Raw numbers do indicate
that there is no time to waste in thoroughly understanding this trend -- and in
reversing it.

A combination of aggressive law enforcement and education are important. But no
more so than public involvement. People must speak up against intolerance. And
no hate crime should go unreported. It is up to the people of Michigan to show
that theirs is not a state where people look the other way when there is
violence against those who are different.

SAFETY'S TOP-OF-THE-LINE Subway tops other systems in transit survey

BYLINE: By PETE DONOHUE DAILY NEWS STAFF WRITER

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3

LENGTH: 390 words

Start spreading the news: New York's subway system may be the safest in the
nation.

A Daily News analysis of the seven largest comparable subways in the country
found that Big Apple riders are less likely to be crime victims than their
counterparts in Washington, San Francisco, Boston and other hubs.

And the Transit Authority's sprawling network is the only one of the seven -
excluding the Port Authority's PATH - that has all its lines running 24 hours a
day, seven days a week.

Based on an average weekday ridership of 4.5 million, the subway system sees
about 65 crimes per 100,000 riders.

PATH, which runs in New York and New Jersey, is the second safest - with just 68
crimes per 100,000 riders.

Boston ranks third, followed by Chicago, San Francisco's Bay Area Rapid Transit,
the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority network and the Metropolitan
Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority system.

"We're pleased that the Daily News has confirmed by its own survey that the
teamwork between the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the NYPD's
Transit Bureau ensures that we have the safest system around," MTA Chairman
Peter Kalikow said.

The MTA is the parent agency of the TA, which runs the buses and subways in New
York.

Killings on the rails or in stations are rare all around with just seven total
this year on all of the systems.

Grand larceny - stealth crimes most often committed by pickpockets and described
as the taking of property without force - were the most prevalent crimes
reported.

The various transportation authorities and the police departments in charge of
security for their networks provided the crime and ridership statistics used for
the analysis.

Some had different definitions for assault - Boston, for example, included
misdemeanors, while New York counts only felonies. Others were somewhat vague
with their information.

A BART spokesman said some of its crimes occurred in parking lots, but he could
not say how many. Subway crime in the city is down about 13% this year and is at
its lowest level in decades. Police have credited a crackdown on fare beaters;
fare evasion arrests are up about 23%.

Homicide, rape, robbery: The numbers are fewer But crime is rising among teens

BYLINE: Kevin V. Johnson

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 8A

LENGTH: 1367 words


Serious crime fell in 1995 for the fourth consecutive year, further
proof that the crime wave of the late 1980s has ebbed, at least
temporarily.

The FBI said Sunday that a preliminary report found that the number
of violent crimes reported to police declined 4% in 1995 compared
with 1994. Property crime fell 1%.

Overall, crime dropped in seven of eight categories. Only larceny,
the least serious type of crime, rose, inching up 1%.


The most significant drops:

-- Murder, -8%

-- Rape, -6%

-- Robbery, -7%

-- Aggravated assault, -3%

-- Burglary, -5%

-- Car theft, -6%

Crime fell the most in the nine largest cities. For example, murders
fell 25% in New York to 1,170 and 11% in Chicago to 824.

The Clinton administration took credit for the decline, saying
its effort to put more police on the street was paying off.

"We will continue to put more cops on the beat, get guns off
the street and put violent criminals behind bars," U.S. Attorney
General Janet Reno said.

Police found good news even within the bad news.

New Orleans had the nation's highest reported murder rate for
the second year in a row -- 73 per 100,000 residents in 1995.
But that city's 363 murders in 1995 represent a 14% drop from
1994. And the decline appears to be continuing: the rate for the
first quarter of 1996 is 25% lower than the first quarter of 1995.

"We think we've made a lot of progress," New Orleans spokeswoman
Michele Moore said.

Some, though, fear that the decreases in violent crime may not
continue.

Criminologist James Fox of Northeastern University in Boston said
an explosion in teen-age crime will mean higher crime rates in
the future.

"We have two crime trends in this country," he said. "The good
news is crimes committed by adults are down. The bad news is crime
continues to rise among teen-agers."

Fox said murders committed by adults declined 18% between 1990
and 1994, while murders committed by 14- to 17-year-olds rose
22%.

"The bad news is that we have 39 million kids under 10 years
old now. They'll be teen-agers before you can say 'juvenile crime
wave.' If current trends persist, there will likely be a bloodbath
that will make 1995 look like the good old days."



Highest, lowest U.S. homicide rates

The number of homicides reported in 1995 in the USA fell to about
21,400, about 8% fewer than the previous year. Local law enforcement

Reno applauds anti-violence success / Local-federal focus causes some friction

BYLINE: Sam Vincent Meddis

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 2A

LENGTH: 503 words


President Clinton gets a report from Attorney General Janet Reno today touting
the success of a year-long campaign targeting violent local crimes for federal
prosecution.

The campaign has been praised by law enforcement officials from North Carolina
to California, but it's not a big hit everywhere.

"We feel we're equipped to deal with most of these crimes," says Robert
Deschamps, county prosecutor in Missoula, Mont., and president of the National
District Attorneys Association.

Deschamps says federal authorities often cause local friction by "cherry
picking" -- grabbing the most high-profile cases to gain media publicity for
themselves.

But U.S. Attorney Chuck Grace of the Southern District of Illinois says the
campaign has helped foster cooperation and cut turf battles through the creation
of local/federal task forces. "We just had that history of turf problems, and
we've gone a long way in eliminating it. We're talking to each other; we're
sharing our resources."

According to a copy of Reno's report, obtained by USA TODAY, federal prosecutors
filed criminal charges against 7,109 violent and repeat offenders between March
1 and Dec. 31, 1994. The report also notes that more than 4,100 of those
defendants were charged with federal firearms violations.

Statistics were not available on how many suspects were targeted for prosecution
before this campaign.

About 95% of all criminal cases nationally are handled by local prosecutors. The
rest fall under federal jurisdiction.

Reno also is expected to announce today $ 15 million in grants to nearly 150 law
enforcement teams nationwide.

Last March, during the height of the anti-crime movement in Washington, Reno and
Vice President Gore announced that fighting violence would be a top priority of
federal law enforcement.

All 93 U.S. attorneys had to come up with a plan to go after the most pressing
violent crime in their districts. Results cited by Reno:

-- In Shreveport, La., federal and local authorities brought murder and drug
trafficking charges against 13 leaders and members of a violent drug gang called
the "Bottoms Boys." Police say violent crime in the gang's neighborhood plunged
34% after the arrests.

-- In Fort Dodge, Iowa, 38 gang members were convicted on drug and weapons
charges. After the arrests, assaults dropped 33%.

-- In New York's Bronx, federal racketeering indictments -- charging a long
string of murder, drug dealing and weapons offenses -- helped dismantle two
gangs. After the arrests, the homicide rate was cut in half in the precinct
where the gangs operated.

"I'm enthusiastic," says Omaha Deputy Police Chief Charlie Circo.

One way federal and local authorities cooperate in Omaha is to have city police
obtain search warrants from state judges -- less cumbersome than going to
federal judges -- then, after an arrest is made, turn the defendant over to
federal prosecutors.

"We use the best parts (of the judicial system) . . . and make it tougher on the
bad guy," Circo says.

Violent crime rises for 2nd year;
But rates are still historically low

BYLINE: Donna Leinwand Leger, USA TODAY,

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 1A

LENGTH: 349 words


Violent crime in the United States rose for the second year in a row, a
government report said Thursday, indicating that the nation's two-decade decline
in crime has ended.

The 2012 National Crime Victimization Survey by the Bureau of Justice Statistics
found that 26 of every 1,000 people experienced violent crime, a 15% increase in
how many people reported being victims of rape, robbery or assault. Property
crime -- burglary, theft and car theft -- rose 12%.

"We've plateaued. At this point, I don't think we're going to see any more
decreases in crime," said criminologist James Alan Fox of Northeastern
University in Boston. "The challenge will be making sure crime rates don't go
back up."

Even so, after two decades of falling crime rates, violent crime remains at
historically low levels. Crime rates have dropped steadily since 1993, when 80
of every 1,000 people reported being victims of violent crime. The homicide rate
declined 48% from 1993 to 2011.

Keeping more criminals behind bars longer and developing better crime-fighting
technology helped drive down crime rates, Fox said. "Police can be much more
proactive in dealing with crime problems before they get out of hand," he said.

The report follows the FBI's 2012 Uniform Crime Report, released in September,
which documented more than 1.2 million violent crimes nationwide -- about 1%
more than in 2011. For 2011, data from the victims survey also showed an
increase in violent crime: up 17% from 2010, the sharpest rise in two decades.

The victimization survey, which collects data from 162,940 people over age 12,
found that 26 of every 1,000 people were victims of crime in 2012, up from 23 in
2011. Most of the increase is made up of simple assaults and crimes that were
not reported to police.

Taken together, the figures indicate a slight shift in direction, said James
Lynch, chairman of the University of Maryland's criminology and criminal justice
department.

"It's not exactly a crime wave. It's more like a flattening out," Lynch said. "I
don't see this as terribly alarming, but more as something to pay attention to."

Crime Stoppers turns 20; benefit event slated Wednesday

BYLINE: By SHARON DETTMER; Tribune Correspondent

SECTION: LOCAL; Pg. D7; HOMETOWN

LENGTH: 534 words


When the trail of a criminal case turns cold, citizens can provide the clue that
solves a crime.

"Money speaks, especially to people who have information about crime activity,"
said South Bend Police Capt. Ed Friend.

And that's why the South Bend Area Crime Stoppers program is a success story, he
added.

Close to 6,235 crimes have been solved since the local program's inception in
May 1983. Through helpful tips from anonymous callers, unsolved crimes in 13
counties in northern Indiana and southwest Michigan have been resolved.

To celebrate the 20th anniversary of Crime Stoppers, there will be a benefit
event, "Crime Stoppers 20th Anniversary Celebration," Wednesday at the Windsor
Park Conference Center, 4020 Edison Lakes Parkway, Mishawaka.

The celebration begins at 6:30 p.m. with dinner and a program at 7 p.m. A video
will highlight cases solved by tips from callers throughout the years. Crime
Stoppers is requesting corporate contributors to donate two tickets, if possible
to the police department, so local police officers may attend the event.

For ticket information, call (574) 288-7867 or 1-800-342-7867. Also, donations
may be mailed to Crime Stoppers, 701 W. Sample St., South Bend, IN 46601.

Monetary pledges to Crime Stoppers help fund caller rewards -- the program does
not receive funding from any taxes or federal grants.

Here's how Crime Stoppers receives new leads to solve an unresolved crime: An
anonymous caller calls 1-800-342-7867 or (574) 288-7867 with a crime tip. Each
caller is issued an identification number used when for subsequent calls or when
a reward is paid. A reward is paid if the information provided by a caller leads
to the apprehension, arrest or indictment of a criminal offender.

This unique reward system always preserves the caller's anonymity throughout the
process.

Rewards are also paid to callers who provide the location of felony fugitives to
police through the "Most Wanted Program."

Capt. Friend, who serves as a liaison for mental health, geriatrics and adult
protective services for the police department, first saw the program's potential
at a Crime Stoppers International Conference in Rockford, Ill., in 1983.

Former South Bend Police Detective Lt. Robert "Sam" Walsh was selected as the
first South Bend Area Crime Stoppers program coordinator, because of his
expertise with the department's homicide and narcotics police units, according
to Friend.

"Sam has a lot of experience in dealing with the criminal underworld," Friend
said.

Walsh quickly sold the police rank and file on the benefits of Crime Stoppers.
"I got fired-up, seeing the potential of this program in Rockford, Ill. I knew
it would be great," Walsh said.

South Bend Police Lt. David Shock, coordinator of South Bend Area Crime Stoppers
since 1991, said another homicide case -- 66 in all -- has been solved with the
help of tips supplied by callers.

He works with local media to publicize "The Crime of the Week" in an effort to
solve challenging cases.

A tip of valuable information can make all of the difference in the world.

"It is so satisfying when a homicide case is solved," Shock said. "The victim's
family is always elated."

Denver among nation's cities honored for crime prevention

Denver has taken a significant bite out of crime, and today city officials can
digest their success.

Denver and five other major U.S. cities are being recognized in a National Crime
Prevention Council book being unveiled this morning in Washington.

"We attribute our success to a strong relationship between law enforcement and
the community," said Charlotte Stephens, director of Denver's Safe City Office
and in Washington to represent the city. "It says a lot about what we do in the
city and how we care about our quality of life."

The book, "Riding the Crest of the Crime Prevention Wave: Six Safer Cities," is
being published by the council and the International Center for Prevention of
Crime. The nonprofit council is best known for its McGruff the Crime Dog public
service slogan: Take a Bite Out of Crime.

From 1986 to 1996, Denver's crime rate decreased by 8 percent, according to the
National Crime Prevention Council. Violent crimes dropped 18 percent and
property crimes 6 percent during the 10-year period.

The council's Theresa Kelly said Denver's problem-solving policing philosophy
and a curfew program stand out as models.

Other cities mentioned in the book include Boston; Fort Worth, Texas; Hartford,
Conn.; New York; and San Diego.

At the National Press Club today, Stephens will tell Denver's story of cutting
back on crime.

3 cities in East worst for crime

BYLINE: Tom Squitieri

LENGTH: 1211 words


Atlanta, Miami and Washington, D.C., were the USA's crime troika in 1990 -
leading the bloody way toward a record number of murders and violent crimes.

Final FBI statistics for 1990, released over the weekend, show Washington
remained the U.S. murder capital, with 77.8 persons per 100,000 slain.
Washington is on its way to its fourth straight record murder rate this year.

But Miami had the greatest rate of violent crime, with 4,353 incidents per
100,000, while Atlanta was the overall crime leader, with 192.4 incident per
1,000, according to the FBI's 1990 Uniform Crime Statistics report.

''The increases are going to continue through the end of the decade,'' predicted
Paul Tracy , a Northeastern University criminologist.

He says drug trafficking has become institutionalized, the economic recession
has made people desperate, and population trends have produced a growing number
of males ages 15 to 25 - the most violent-prone years.

Violent crime covers homicide, rape, robbery and aggravated assault. Overall
crime includes all of those plus burglary, larceny and theft.

Nationwide, a record number of people - 732 per 100,000 - were hit by violent
crimes in 1990, up from 664 per 100,000 in 1989, according to the FBI.

The report also said:

- A record 23,438 people were murdered in 1990, a rate of 9.4 per 100,000. That
tops a preliminary 1990 estimate of 23,220 - and is an 8% increase from 1989.
Guns were used in three of every five murders.

- The number of reported rapes rose 8.1%, to 41.2 per 100,000. There were
102,555 women who reported rapes in 1990 - 80 of every 100,000 in the USA.

- Robbery rose 10.3%, to 257 per 100,000, leaving 639,271 victims.

- Aggravated assault was up 10.6%, to 424.1 per 100,000, with 1,054,863 assaults
reported nationwide.

Amid Endless Killings, Area Burglaries and Rapes Dropped

BYLINE: Eugene L. Meyer, Ruben Castaneda, Washington Post Staff Writers

LENGTH: 1253 words


Even as arrests for drug sales and possession in the Washington area soared in
the 1980s, crimes against property such as robbery and burglary declined sharply
during the decade, according to a Washington Post survey of 10 local
jurisdictions.

Police officers credited the growth of crime awareness and neighborhood watch
programs for the drop in burglaries. But some experts said the statistics may
also indicate that criminals are gravitating away from the less lucrative,
low-return illicit activities, such as housebreaking, into the more profitable
realm of drug dealing, with its promise of quick returns.

"On the whole, we're seeing the decline of a certain type of crime for a much
more profitable and no more risky [in terms of apprehension] kind of crime --
drug dealing," said Robert Fosen, a professor of criminal justice at American
University. "It's like everything else in the world -- we all take risks and
weigh them against potential rewards. If you're going to roll the dice, you
might as well be a high-roller."

While the drug trade boomed in the 1980s in this area, declines in burglaries
ranged from 23 percent in the District to 45 percent in Arlington County, 60
percent in Fairfax County and 67 percent in Loudoun County on the outer suburban
fringe.

The rate of homicides -- most of them drug-related -- rose dramatically in the
District and Prince George's County -- increasing by 128 percent and 121 percent
respectively. The homicide rate climbed to a lesser extent elsewhere: 19 percent
in Alexandria, 16 percent in Fairfax and 4 percent in Montgomery County.

But residents of the District and Prince George's fared differently depending on
where they lived. Most homicides, for instance, occurred inside the Capital
Beltway in Prince George's and in lower-income sections of Northeast and
Southeast Washington.

The same was true for assaults, which were up in the District by 61 percent and
in Prince George's by 53 percent. Assaults also rose in rapidly growing Prince
William County by 46 percent and jumped 382 percent in Loudoun.

While the District's homicide rate was the highest in the nation last year,
overall the city ranks 16th in major crimes per capita after Atlanta; Fort
Worth; Dallas; Seattle; St. Louis; Jacksonville, Fla.; San Antonio; Detroit;
Kansas City, Mo.; Boston; Oklahoma City; Austin, Tex.; Houston; El Paso; and
Chicago.

Life continued to be statistically less risky in the Washington suburbs.

"The risks of violence and victimization are racially and geographically
segregated to a level which is remarkable, even for American cities. [The risks]
are cordoned off from a large and privileged class," said Frank Zimring,
director of the Earl Warren Legal Institute at the University of California at
Berkeley, "Nobody has his office in the urban ghetto . . . and Washington is a
city of offices.

"The risks are horrendously high if you are geographically and economically and
racially at kind of the short end of the civic stick," said Zimring, ". . . The
part with white skins and high incomes lives at low risk from crimes of violence
. . . ."

"In terms of homicides, two-thirds of the bodies we pick up have drugs in their
systems," said Stephen Rickman, director of statistical analysis in the
District's office of criminal justice plans and analysis. ". . . For those who
aren't involved in the criminal milieu, I would suggest their level of safety is
certainly no worse and could be better than at the beginning of the decade."

Police said the burglary rate has declined as more residents have installed
security systems, sturdy locks and adequate lighting around their homes to
discourage nighttime intruders.

"People do listen to crime prevention programs, and they do show up for
community meetings," Deputy Carol Showalter of the Loudoun County Sheriff's
Department said.

The sharp drop in certain property crimes is "good news of a sort that's a
'non-story,' " Zimring said. "Nobody calls a press conference with this sort of
good news. Insurance companies don't send out notices because of the falling off
of burglaries," which have declined nationally as well.

Loudoun County had the sharpest decrease in burglaries, despite a dramatic rise
in population. Burglaries in the county dropped from 481 in 1980 to 160 in 1989
-- even as the population increased from 59,000 in 1980 to 89,000 in 1989.

Although the District had a far higher, if declining, rate of burglaries than
the other jurisdictions, this does not mean that every section of the city was
equally at risk. "We know for a fact most of your burglaries don't happen in
Ward 3," American University criminologist James Lynch said, referring to the
area roughly west of Rock Creek Park.

The figures also show that although the District has more homicides, robberies,
assaults and burglaries per capita than the other jurisdictions, as it did at
the beginning of the decade, a woman is less likely to be raped in Washington
now than she is in Prince George's County, Alexandria or Arlington.

However, even in those three jurisdictions, rapes declined in the 1980s, bucking
a trend in many areas where reported rapes are up. Rapes per 100,000 people in
Fairfax dropped from 15.6 to 10.3.

"Maybe drug use serves as an inhibiting factor in the crime of rape," Rickman
said. Rapes in the District dropped from a total of 439 in 1980 to 165 in 1988,
the last year for which complete figures are available.

In the region, there was a sharp decline in robberies in all jurisdictions
except Howard County, where such crimes rose 26 percent. The District
experienced a 60 percent drop in robberies from the peak year of 1981 to 1987.

In absolute numbers, the District had 8,897 robberies in 1980. Since then, the
numbers have declined to a low of 4,462 in 1987, before rising again to 5,659 in
1988, the last full year for which figures are available.

Several police officers said it is no coincidence that robbery statistics fell
as narcotics crimes soared.

A D.C. homicide investigator who used to work in the robbery division put it
this way: "It's a lot easier to deal drugs. If you burglarize a place, you have
to find a fence . . . it's more complicated [than drug dealing]. And there's no
money in robbery -- a lot of businesses are very security-conscious."

The detective added that the lucrative drug dealing market contributes to a
decrease in robbery statistics another way. "If you're going to do a robbery, it
makes more sense to go for a drug dealer," the investigator said. "They have a
lot more money than McDonald's, and they aren't going to report being robbed."

Sgt. Bruce Elliott of the Prince George's County police noted that most
first-time drug offenders are far less likely to receive harsh penalties if they
are caught than armed robbers.

"If you go out and sell drugs and are caught, and it's your first time, chances
are you wouldn't do time," Elliott said. "If you do an armed robbery and are
caught, chances are you'll do hard prison time."

Some armed robbers who have done their time and are released realize this, and
turn to drug dealing, Elliott said.

Said Berkeley's Zimring: "Drugs are so much now of a criminal opportunity, you
may have burglars and robbers going into that instead. Robbery is a lousy way to
make a living. It's like hang gliding. You've got to have a lot of risk-taking
folks who don't read the numbers."

COMMENTARY;
Back to the basics on police work

BYLINE: Anthony Bradley The Philadelphia Inquirer

SECTION: IL OPINION; Pg. 9

LENGTH: 665 words


America has found itself at a crossroads, further embroiled in divisive tensions
between law enforcement officials and the local citizens they are sworn to
serve. The recent shooting deaths of Terence Crutcher in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and
Keith Lamont Scott in Charlotte, North Carolina, have only further encumbered
any chance of reconciling the trust that has been lost between the two entities
in cities and towns across the nation.

Perhaps the most viable solution to this ongoing tragedy is to return to the
"old school" tactics of law enforcement.

A study recently released by the Washington-based nonprofit Police Foundation
proves that such solidarity can be achieved by convincing cops to park their
police cruisers and get back to patrolling the streets by foot.

The study examines the positive effects of foot patrol programs in five cities
across the nation: Cambridge, Massachusetts; Evanston; Kalamazoo, Michigan; New
Haven, Connecticut; and Portland, Oregon -- and the data found that such
programs reduced crime rates, improved the legitimacy of police forces, and
ultimately strengthened relationships between communities and local
law-enforcement agencies.

The study concluded that foot patrol programs improved the relationship between
citizens and law enforcement, enhanced the ability of the police force to
enforce the law, changed how citizens viewed officers and reduced both the fear
of crime and the number of violent crimes committed. Additionally, the data show
that foot patrols even have psychological benefits for officers, as they have
more opportunities for positive interaction with the local community.

Some outside studies quoted by the report have found that smaller communities
(like the ones examined in the Police Foundation report) benefit the most from
increased foot patrols.

In most of these cities, foot patrols create a better sense of approachability,
familiarity and trust of officers among residents of the community, and in some
instances, cities reported higher levels of overall satisfaction with the police
from members of the community.

For example, a collaboration in Philadelphia between the police force and Temple
University's Department of Criminal Justice found that when they sent foot
patrols into the areas of the city with the highest crime rates, those rates
often fell as a result. After three months, the areas witnessed a 23 percent
decrease in violent crime and a prevention of 53 violent crimes.

If the outcome in Philadelphia is any indication of the success of these
policies, the Police Foundation report must be taken seriously. Bridging the
disconnect between police officers and citizens -- who see themselves on the
same side of promoting human well-being -- could certainly help ease the current
tensions and, in a perfect world, even end them completely.

The future success of law enforcement nationwide rests on how well agents can
serve the communities they protect by keeping citizens safe and by fairly, yet
effectively, enforcing the rule of law. A return to tested and tried tactics
like foot patrols might be a small step, but it's certainly a step in the right
direction.

If we care about the common good of man and envision neighborhoods where
citizens can thrive and truly flourish alongside law enforcement, both entities
must trade in their escalating adversarial roles for mutually beneficial
partnerships and collaboration.

While the implementation of community policing may seem more expensive in the
short term, it is no more costly than the price cities and towns must pay to
rebuild businesses and homes that are destroyed or vandalized during outbreaks
of violent riots or social unrest.

Furthermore, as our nation has sadly come to realize all too well, no price can
ever be placed on the value of a human life.

CRIME WATCH A CLICK AWAY

DATELINE: BROOKSVILLE



HIGHLIGHT: Sheriff's Office pioneers with a new Web map.


With only a computer and a good Internet connection, a month's worth of crime
data from Hernando County will be at the fingertips of anyone interested enough
to check it out.

Think of it as an interactive online version of a neighborhood watch.

The Hernando County Sheriff's Office announced Monday the launch of a new crime
-mapping program, said to be the first of its kind in Florida and one of just a
few in use elsewhere around the country.

The mapping technology uses Google Maps and other geographic software to enhance
the viewing of reported crime in unincorporated areas of Hernando.

"Anyone with a computer can utilize this technology," said Sgt. Donna Black, a
spokeswoman for the Sheriff's Office.

The crime data can be accessed through the Sheriff's Office Web site at
hernandosheriff.org, where a link to the mapping site can be found. The site has
the ability to show reported crime - with the exception of some
privacy-sensitive incidents such as child abuse and sexual assault cases - from
the past 30 days.

Money for the $250-a-month program fee will come from drug money seized by the
Sheriff's Office, known as Federal Forfeiture Funds.

"The money will not come from the taxpayers," Sheriff Richard Nugent said. "In
essence, the criminals will be paying to catch criminals."

The Hernando Sheriff's Office joins police departments in Oakland, Calif.,
Lincoln, Neb., Duluth, Minn., and High Point, N.C., in using the program.

Lee Hunt, a crime analyst with the High Point Police Department, said the site
has made it easier for residents to police their own neighborhoods, among other
positive developments. "It was been very, very successful." Hunt said the agency
has been using the program for about two years. "We average well over 1,000
individual queries a day" on the Web site.

For now, the Sheriff's Office crime-mapping site will generally not include
reported crimes within the city limits of Brooksville - the Hernando County seat
- because the city's Police Department has its own record-keeping system.

Brooksville police Chief George Turner said his department was already working
on plans to roll out a revamped Web site in the coming months.

"We want to make it more user-friendly for the public," Turner said.

But Turner, who logged onto the Sheriff Office's new site for the first time
Monday, said he was particularly impressed with the program.

"This looks like a great program ... I'm all for it," Turner said. "But their
record management system and mine are not compatible at the moment and I don't
have any intention of changing that. Our system serves us very well right now."

No. 1 again: Atlanta ranked most violent

BYLINE: R. Robin McDonald; STAFF WRITER

SECTION: LOCAL OLYMPICS; Pg. 01A

LENGTH: 433 words


Atlanta's streets may not be as dangerous as those of Sarajevo, but as it
prepares to open its gates to the world for the Centennial Olympic Games, the
city ranks once more as the most violent in the nation.

Moreover, while violent and property crime fell 2 percent in the nation as a
whole during 1995, Atlanta's crime rate rose 5 percent, making it the crime
leader, with more crimes per person than any other city with a population of
250,000 or more, according to an analysis of FBI statistics released Sunday.

Mayor Bill Campbell said Sunday he was "dismayed" by the numbers.

"We simply must do more and will," he said. "The efforts to make Atlanta a safer
city will intensify no matter what the statistics show. We will never rest until
Atlanta is a safer city."

Police Chief Beverly Harvard would not comment on the statistics, saying she has
a policy of not debating numbers.

Last year, when the city's violent crime rate declined 10 percent and its
ranking among the nation's most dangerous cities fell from first to third,
Harvard credited community policing initiatives and greater involvement by
residents in crime prevention.

An Atlanta Journal-Constitution analysis of the new FBI crime statistics shows
that in 1995, despite 186 homicides, the lowest number in a decade, Atlanta
reclaimed its dubious reputation as the most violent city in the country,
outranking similar-sized cities such as Miami, St.

Louis, Baltimore and Tampa.

A newspaper investigation published in April showed that crime in Atlanta's
public housing developments drives the city's violent crime rate, which rose
three-tenths of a percent last year. Some housing projects have become drug
distribution hubs and havens for gangs.

Property crime - driven by larceny, especially thefts from cars - rose 5 percent
in Atlanta during 1995, although it dropped nationwide.

While the rate of serious crime has declined nationally for four years, experts
cautioned that the causes are unclear and it may not indicate a long-term trend.
They also warn that the new figures mask a rapid rise in violent crime among
teenagers.

The 1995 crime statistics are certain to reopen the debate that Attorney General
Mike Bowers sparked in March when he declared the streets of Sarajevo, Bosnia,
safer than the streets of his hometown.

Campbell criticized Bowers' comments as "reckless, irresponsible and
inaccurate."

On Sunday, Bowers said he takes no pleasure in having his view affirmed. "This
is not a problem for the city alone," he said. "It's a problem for the city and
the state."

New York takes on infamous title

BYLINE: MICHELANGELO RUCCI

LENGTH: 165 words


NEW YORK: New York City has become the crime capital of the US, the FBI reports.

Every 44 seconds a crime is reported to police, every six minutes there is a
mugging, every four minutes a car is stolen, every three hours there is a rape
and every eight hours a murder.

And the figures would be worse if the police were told of all the crimes in this
city.

According to the FBI, which has ranked cities by their crime figures, New York
City is the most violent city in the US followed by Los Angeles, Chicago and
Detriot.

New York State has the worst crime record of the 50 American States with 90 per
cent of its felonies committed in New York City, which has 41 per cent of the
State's population.

New York's crime-growth figures outpace the rest of the US. Throughout the
State, crime grew by 3.9 per cent last year from 179,053 serious crimes to
186,088. Murders went up to 1905 in New York City.

Los Angeles had 877 murders last year, Chicago 742 and Detriot 624.

NEW YORK: New York City has become the crime capital of the US, the FBI reports.

Every 44 seconds a crime is reported to police, every six minutes there is a
mugging, every four minutes a car is stolen, every three hours there is a rape
and every eight hours a murder.

And the figures would be worse if the police were told of all the crimes in this

DATELINE: ALBANY, Nov. 10


The state's crime rate dropped 8.8 percent from 1982 to 1983, the Division of
Criminal Justice Services reported today.

According to statistics released by the division, violent crime fell by 7.4
percent and property crime dropped by 9.1 percent. In all, 10.29 million crimes
were reported in the state in 1983, down from 11.29 million in 1982.

In New York City, 6.23 million crimes were reported in 1983, a drop of 9.6
percent from the 6.89 million reported in 1982.

The Criminal Justice Commissioner, Richard Condon, said the figures ''could
reflect the strengthening of law enforcement and community efforts to reduce
crime, as well as a reduction in the number of young persons in our
population.''

The division said murders in the state dropped from 2,011 in 1982 to 1,951 in
1983 and robberies fell from 107,514 in 1982 to 94,733 in 1983. Rapes increased
from 5,132 in 1982 to 5,280 in 1983.

The crimes tallied in the crime index are murder, rape, robbery, aggravated
assault, burglary, larceny and motor vehicle theft.

2 JUSTICE DEPT. NOMINEES DEFEND U.S. ANTICRIME PLAN

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to the New York Times

SECTION: Section 1; Page 9, Column 3; National Desk

LENGTH: 537 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 27


Two of President Reagan's nominees for toplevel positions at the Justice
Department encountered skepticism today when they told senators that the
department could lead a fight against violent crime without spending any more
money on the problem.

Rudolph W. Giuliani, the nominee for Associate Attorney General, and D. Lowell
Jensen, named to be Assistant Attorney General in charge of the criminal
division, said that the department's new emphasis on combating violent crime
implied no diminution of efforts against white-collar crime, narcotics and
organized crime.

Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, chided the Reagan Administration,
saying it was promising more than it could reasonably expect to deliver.
''What,'' he asked, ''will the Administration do that will significantly make a
difference on violent crime in America?''

The Senator urged the Administration to ''call a spade a spade and say there
really isn't a lot the Federal Government can do about violent crime,''
especially while cutting the budget for activities such as narcotics
enforcement.

No Threat to Senate Approval

Mr. Jensen, a Democrat who has been District Attorney of Alameda County in
California for nearly 12 years, said that he did not ''equate effort with
dollars.''

He and Mr. Giuliani, a former Federal prosecutor in New York, appeared at a
joint confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee.

The skeptical questions raised no threat to Senate approval of the two nominees
but it did underline some of the potential contradictions in the
Administration's simultaneous emphasis on fiscal austerity, states' rights and a
larger role for the Federal Government in fighting violent crime.

Mr. Giuliani, who will supervise the criminal division, drug enforcement and
immigration matters, said the Justice Department was already ''substantially
involved'' in the fight against violent crime. For example, he said, 11 percent
of pending criminal cases involved violent offenses.

'More Expansive' Role Urged

Senator Arlen Specter, a Pennsylvania Republican who once served as District
Attorney in Philadelphia, retorted that Federal cases represented only a small
percentage of all prosecutions for violent crime. To have a visible effect on
such crime, he said, the Federal Government may have to interpret its role in a
much ''more expansive'' fashion.

Attorney General William French Smith has appointed an advisory committee to
propose ways of improving the Federal response to violent crime.

Mr. Jensen strongly endorsed the principle of fixed, or determinate, sentencing,
such as that recently adopted by California to reduce the discretion of judges
in punishing convicted criminals.

''Rehabilitation hasn't worked,'' he said. ''We haven't lerned how to do it.''
The rehabilitation of criminals is a ''worthy effort,'' he added, but prison
officials have few ways to tell when the goal has been achieved.

Violent-crime surge is worst in Midwest, FBI says in report

BYLINE: By Jeremy Kohler ST. LOUIS POST-DISPATCH

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A3

LENGTH: 503 words


St. Louis had plenty of company in experiencing a surge of violence last year,
according to crime figures released Monday by the FBI.

The nation saw a 2.5 percent increase in violent crime -- murder, rape, robbery
and assault -- and a staggering 4.8 percent increase in murder, the bureau said
in a preliminary report.

The 12-state Midwest region fared even worse, with reports of violent crime
rising by 5.7 percent. Some criminologists pointed to higher unemployment rates
in the region.

In Detroit, "the federal government is monitoring city finances, the school
system is breaking up, the police morale is very low," said Liqun Cao, an
Eastern Michigan University criminologist. "When you put all that together, not
surprising that crime would go up."

St. Louis, which announced its 20-percent spike in violent crime in January,
fared well compared with Detroit, Minneapolis and Milwaukee, which each saw
reports of violent crime jump by about one-third. In St. Louis, police Chief Joe
Mokwa said assaults continued to climb during the first five months this year.

St. Louis has "too many young people who seem to have limited interest in things
other than misbehavior and violence," he said, noting that a host of
interventions announced this year were having mixed results.

Police officials in other cities echoed his sentiments.

"Instead of solving problems with fisticuffs, they're using guns," said Anne E.
Schwartz, a Milwaukee police spokeswoman.

After steep declines in U.S. crime during the 1990s, followed by five years of
unevenly middling results, 2005 marked the first year that reports of crime
increased uniformly across U.S. cities, said Richard Rosenfeld, a criminologist
at the University of Missouri at St. Louis.

It is too early to determine whether the trend would continue, he said.

A shift appeared to be taking place in the second tier of cities -- with
populations between 50,000 and 500,000 -- where violent crimes, particularly
murder, jumped more than in either very big or very small cities.

"The big story, of course, for 10 years and more has been the big decline in
homicide nationally," said David Kennedy, a director of the Center on Crime
Prevention and Control at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York.
"What always used to drive it was decreases in the big cities."

Now what's fueling the increase is a violent surge in cities like Rochester,
N.Y., and High Point, N.C., Kennedy said.

That's "not too promising" for the nation, he said.

A silver lining might be that aggressive crime-fighting policies employed by
police in the biggest cities seem to be insulating those places from similar
increases, Kennedy suggested.

The problem has little to do with the economic health of those cities, he said.

"This is as much or more about street norms and street culture as it is about
anything else. When the idea becomes prevalent in small towns, that if someone
disrespects you, you have to shoot them, there are going to be more shootings."

Broken Arrow, Tulsa seen as worlds apart in safety

BYLINE: Carrie Coppernoll, Staff Writer

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 1A

LENGTH: 372 words


The safest and most dangerous cities in Oklahoma are next-door neighbors.

Broken Arrow was named the safest of the five Oklahoma cities listed in the
"City Crime Rankings" annual report released Monday by the Morgan Quitno Press.

Tulsa, which borders Broken Arrow, was named the most dangerous in Oklahoma.

Morgan Quitno Press, an independent research and publishing company based in
Lawrence, Kan., ranked 354 cities according to crime rates for murder, rape,
robbery, aggravated assault, burglary and motor vehicle theft, President Scott
Morgan said.

Two Oklahoma cities were ranked toward the top, or most safe. Broken Arrow was
ranked No. 46 and Norman was ranked No. 86.

Two cities were ranked toward the bottom: Oklahoma City at No. 283, and Tulsa at
No. 304.

Lawton finished between the two extremes at No. 184.

The study, which took FBI Uniform Crime Report for 2003 figures and placed them
in a formula to produce the rankings, is not all inclusive.

Illinois cities, including Chicago, are not included because they do not follow
FBI reporting guidelines. Other cities left out include Canton, Ohio; Lakewood,
Colo.; New Haven, Conn.; Olathe, Kan.; Roanoke, Va.; Green Bay, Wis.; Kalamazoo,
Mich.; and Kansas City, Kan.

Broken Arrow Mayor Richard Carter said the combination of a good police
department and an active community result in a safe city. And gang crimes have
not been a problem, he said.

"We have a very low tolerance level for outside crime coming in, drifting over
into our community," the mayor said.

Like Broken Arrow, Norman has less gang crime than neighboring Oklahoma City,
Police Chief Phil Cotten said.

"We have no bad parts of town," he said.

In Tulsa, a growing gang task force has helped reduce homicides. So far this
year, 44 people have died from homicide in Tulsa. Last year, 69 people died,
Chief Dave Been said.

A new robbery task force was started about two weeks ago, Been said.

Crime is dropping, but budget problems continue to keep the number of police
officers low, Been said.

"We feel like we do the best with the least," he said.

In Oklahoma City, crime trend specialists are helping administrators decide how
to dole out resources, Sgt. Charles Phillips said. The goal is to target and
reduce specific crime rates.

Conventions come to risky areas?

BYLINE: Gary Stoller

SECTION: MONEY; Pg. 7B

LENGTH: 1658 words

Nearly all the nation's major convention centers are in neighborhoods where the
crime risk is much higher than the national average, a new study by a crime
forecasting company reveals.

Of the 25 largest convention centers and exhibit halls, 22 are in neighborhoods
where the crime likelihood is at least double the national average, finds the
study, which was conducted for USA TODAY by CAP Index of Exton, Pa.

(Boston's FleetCenter, site of this week's Democratic National Convention,
didn't make the top 25 list provided by Tradeshow Week.) The area around
Chicago's McCormick Place, the country's largest convention facility, has the
highest risk -- 13 times greater than the national average and eight times that
of Cook County. The risk in areas outside convention centers in Detroit and
Washington is 10 times greater than the national norm. By contrast, the
neighborhoods around Donald E. Stephens Convention Center in Rosemont, Ill.,
Cleveland's I-X Center and Orlando's Orange County Convention Center have the
lowest crime risks. The study's findings, however, don't reveal the actual
number of crime incidents.


CAP Index says its crime-risk determinations are 70% to 90% accurate. It
forecasts crime by plugging into a computer model a variety of factors,
including police statistics, corporate loss reports and demographic information,
such as income and education levels, for an area up to three miles away from a
convention center. Like other probability formulas, the company's methodology
has its limitations, company officials say. It does not take into account some
variables, including police force size, amount of security equipment used and
current events. Still, the company's crime forecasting is used by the federal
government, 21 of the top 25 Fortune 500 companies and lawyers in federal court
cases, says CAP Index Vice President Stephen Longo.

"I don't want anyone to think they'll never be safe outside a convention
center," says Jon Groussman, president and chief operating officer of the
company. "But there are differences in safety levels between neighborhoods. Our
study is one tool to assess the risks, and people should take reasonable
precautions to mitigate those risks."

About 52 million people will attend North American conventions and trade shows
this year, estimates Tradeshow Week, an industry publication. Only a very small
percentage are likely to become crime victims, say meeting planners, police,
convention center and CAP Index officials.

But convention attendees are "a gold mine for thieves," and many are victimized
each year inside and outside facilities, says Kathryn Jurgensen, CEO of Premier
Meetings in Irvine, Calif. "Security is at the forefront of my clients' minds,"
says Jurgensen, who plans events for Toyota, Motorola and other companies.

Convention center officials in Chicago and other cities say their security
programs, as well as transportation programs that shuttle visitors to and from
hotels, keep attendees safe. Billy Weinberg, a spokesman for the Metropolitan
Pier and Exposition Authority, which runs McCormick Place, says 73 full-time
security personnel work there, and more than 100 additional personnel and 10 to
12 police officers may be present at a major show.

Weinberg says, "I don't want to refute the data, but the typical
convention-goers' experience is not reflected in the data." He says no one at
McCormick Place can recall a high number of crime incidents involving
convention-goers or their property.

Laurence Mulcrone, McCormick Place's security director, says the neighborhood
outside the Chicago convention facility has had crime problems in the past. But
as dilapidated homes were razed and replaced by new condos and adjacent land
bought up by McCormick Place, the crime rate has dropped, he says.

"I'm very confident that the people who are attending conventions are extremely
safe," Mulcrone says. "We go to great lengths to ensure safety."

McCormick Place, which attracts 4 million annual visitors, sits largely within
the Chicago Police Department's District 1. According to latest Chicago police
statistics, there were 3,603 crimes committed in that district during the first
six months of this year, about 6% fewer than the year-earlier period. Most
crimes involved theft, but there also were 258 violent crimes, including four
murders. A small section of McCormick Place is in District 21, where crimes
during the first half of this year dropped 2% to 2,259.

Chicago Police Department spokesman David Bayless says there's "a high incidence
of theft" in Beat 133, a 20-by-10-block area that includes McCormick Place. The
department is unable to determine how many thefts involve convention-goers, he
says. Chicago police statistics show that there were 412 criminal incidents,
including 349 thefts, in that area during the first six months this year.

McCormick Place statistics, Weinberg says, show that last year there were no
murders, rapes or assaults, but the security staff received reports of 54
incidents of theft or attempted theft, 17 of vandalism and 465 of property
damage. Some incidents did not occur at the convention center, and crime is
suspected in only about 5% of the property damage reports, Mulcrone says.

CAP Index officials say their statistics are not indicative of the level of
safety within a convention facility, which may be well protected. The company's
crime risk only predicts the likelihood of crime in surrounding areas.

Detroit. The neighborhood outside Cobo Conference/Exhibition Center ranks second
in crime risk, the CAP Index shows. The crime risk is about five times greater
than in its entire local county, Wayne County, CAP Index says.

The latest Detroit Police Department statistics show that 1,540 crimes were
committed Dec. 29, 2003-July 11, 2004, in Precinct 1, where the facility is
located. James Tate, a police public information officer, says that precinct
"historically had the lowest amount of crime within the city," and crime
citywide has declined in the past few years. This year, crime is on the rise,
particularly non-fatal shootings, "a trend going on in a lot of major cities."

John Williams, director of security at the Cobo Center, said he couldn't comment
about nearby crime. He directed questions to the local police.

Washington, D.C. Officer Kenny Bryson, a spokesman for Washington's Metropolitan
Police Department, says CAP Index's forecast of a high crime likelihood outside
the Washington Convention Center, which opened last year, would be typical of
any convention center neighborhood in a big city. Crime is down citywide and in
the Third District where the convention center is located. But "we still have a
lot of work to do," he says. During the first six months of this year, police
statistics show that nearly 4,000 crimes were committed in the Third District, a
17% drop from the year-earlier period.

The site of the new convention center was a hangout for drug dealers years ago,
and the neighborhood is in transition, Bryson says. "It's not nirvana now," and
visitors should "be aware of the surroundings," particularly at nighttime, he
says.

CAP Index says the crime risk in the area near the convention center is nearly
three times greater than in the entire district.

A Washington convention center official directed questions to local police.

Neighborhood crime risk

Crime forecasting company CAP Index predicts the likelihood of crime in the
neighborhoods around the country's 25 largest convention centers and exhibit
halls. A score of 100 represents the average national or local county crime
risk.

A location with a national CAP Index score of 1,312 for the area outside
Chicago's McCormick Place, for example, indicates that the predicted crime risk
there is more than 13 times greater than the national average. A county CAP
Index score of 815 indicates that the area's crime risk is more than 8 times
greater than the risk in Cook County, where Chicago is located. Any score above
100 indicates an above-average predicted crime risk; any score below 100
represents a below-average risk. CAP Index says its scores are 70%-90% accurate.
The scores do not represent the likelihood of crime within a convention center.

F.B.I. Study Finds Gun Use In Violent Crimes Declining

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD

SECTION: Section A; Page 19; Column 5; National Desk

LENGTH: 958 words


In the clearest evidence yet that recent efforts to reduce gun violence through
new laws and police pressure are working, a Federal Bureau of Investigation
report released yesterday shows that a 7 percent drop in homicides in 1998 was
entirely attributable to a decrease in killings committed with guns.

The report also indicates that a significant drop in robberies carried out with
guns helped account for a 10 percent decline in robberies nationwide, the
biggest decrease of any one category of crime.

Over all, the F.B.I.'s annual Uniform Crime Report found that violent crimes and
property crimes each dropped 6 percent last year, the seventh consecutive year
serious crime has fallen and the largest single yearly decline in the 1990's.
The national homicide rate has now fallen to 6.3 per 100,000, which was the
level in 1967, when crime first exploded in the United States.

Alfred Blumstein, a professor of criminology at Carnegie Mellon University in
Pittsburgh, said the most important news in the F.B.I. report was the evidence
that the use of guns in homicides and robberies was declining.

"These numbers suggest to me that the efforts to control the availability of
guns, especially in the hands of young people, are having some effect,"
Professor Blumstein said.

Among these efforts are increased efforts by the Federal Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms to trace guns used in crimes; the tighter Federal
restrictions imposed on gun purchases by the Brady Law of 1994, named after
James Brady, the former White House press secretary who was wounded in the
assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan; and new gun control laws
passed by numerous states, like those limiting purchasers to one handgun a
month.

In addition, the police and prosecutors in many cities, including New York and
Boston, have devised new strategies to cut off the supply of illegal handguns to
criminals and juveniles or make them wary about carrying guns for fear of
arrest.

Another good sign in the report, Professor Blumstein said, was that the
percentage of homicide victims who were female dropped 11 percent in 1998,
suggesting that legal and social efforts to prevent domestic abuse were working.

The report also found that the proportion of victims who knew their killers rose
to 51 percent in 1998 from 48 percent in 1997, meaning that there were fewer
homicides in which the victims were strangers. This is another encouraging
development, Professor Blumstein said, because the random, violent street crimes
that mushroomed with the crack epidemic of the late 1980's were
disproportionately committed by young people against strangers.

The report said that arrests of juveniles for violent crimes fell 8 percent in
1998, compared with a 4 percent drop in adult arrests. It was an increase in
juvenile crime in the late 1980's that caused crime rates to soar.

Geoffrey Canada, the president of the Rheedlen Centers for Children and
Families, a nonprofit social service agency in Harlem, said the drop in crime by
young people was "a reality I see."

While politicians and criminal justice experts have attributed the decline in
crime to tougher police tactics or longer prison sentences, Mr. Canada said he
thought much of the decrease was a result of a change in the attitudes of young
people in the inner cities.

"The notion of the late 1980's and early 90's that crime was an option for young
people, a way to get their sneakers or movie tickets or buy an apartment
building, that whole way of thinking has changed dramatically," Mr. Canada said.

The change has worked like a contagion in reverse, he said: "The fewer kids who
do crime, the fewer will do it."

Another factor, Mr. Canada said, is that prolonged prosperity has finally
provided more jobs in poor minority neighborhoods, "so people now see other
people working and they get the message that work pays, crime doesn't."

James Alan Fox, the Lipman Professor of Criminal Justice at Northeastern
University, cautioned that Americans may be becoming too complacent after seven
straight years of declining crime.

"What goes down will go up," Professor Fox said. "If you don't continue to work
hard at crime prevention, it's like going off a diet."

In fact, the police in New York City reported in June that the number of
killings this year had increased 6 percent over the comparable period in 1998.
Professor Fox said that trend had continued.

The new F.B.I. report said there were 16,914 homicides nationwide in 1998, of
which 10,975 were committed with guns, down from a total of 18,210 in 1997, of
which 12,346 involved guns. The reduction by 1,371 in killings involving a
firearm was greater than the overall drop of 1,296.

Similarly, the report said that robberies committed with guns fell to 38 percent
of all robberies in 1998 from 40 percent in 1997.

Handguns were by far the most common weapon in killings, accounting for 52
percent, while rifles and shotguns each accounted for only 4 percent of all
homicides, the report said.

The predominant role played by handguns underscores the belief, held by
officials in the 28 cities and counties that have filed lawsuits against the
firearms industry, that America's gun violence problem is largely a handgun
problem.

As has been true for as long as crime statistics have been kept, the F.B.I.
report found that the South had the highest homicide rate, 8 per 100,000,
compared with 6 per 100,000 for the Midwest and West and only 4 per 100,000 for
the Northeast.

The F.B.I. report is based on police arrest reports. It measures the violent
crimes of murder, robbery, rape and aggravated assault and the property crimes
of burglary, motor vehicle theft, larceny and arson.

Atlanta will be safe during Games, officials vow

BYLINE: Virginia Anderson; STAFF WRITER

SECTION: LOCAL OLYMPICS; Pg. 01B

LENGTH: 461 words


Atlanta will be the safest city in the world during the Olympics, even if its
violent crime rate is the worst in the nation, ACOG and state officials said
Sunday.

While lamenting that the city ranks first in violent crime based on FBI
statistics, A.D. Frazier of the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games said
it's not fair to judge the safety of Atlanta during the Olympics by the recent
statistics.

"This is not representative of a lack of preparation for the Olympic Games,"
Frazier said, stressing that the city has worked for five years to prepare a
security plan for the Games. "If people who come here will follow instructions,
I think they'll be in the most secure place on Earth."

In a Friday meeting with 100 Atlanta business executives, Bill Rathburn, ACOG's
security director, said street crime in Los Angeles went down during the 1984
Games there because so many police officers were on the streets.

"We have less crime at the Olympics than we do at college football games or
professional football games," he said.

Attorney General Mike Bowers, who recently angered local law enforcement
officials by saying that Sarajevo, Bosnia, was safer than some areas of Atlanta,
agreed that the city's streets will be safe during the Games.

"There will be a massive effort to protect our visitors," Bowers said. "They're
gonna be looked after pretty carefully."

In Atlanta there will be more than 25,000 federal, state and local law
enforcement officers and military personnel assigned to security.

Sophisticated computer programs that will monitor access points at all venues
will help police, as will 10,000 mobile radios, 6,000 pagers and 1,500 cellular
telephones.

Frazier, chief operating officer of ACOG, also said extensive information about
parking and transportation will be given to ticket holders and could be vital in
preventing crime.

Visitors will also receive packets in hotels with common-sense crime- prevention
tips.

While many people are afraid of violent crime in Atlanta, people need to know
that pickpocketing may be a more real threat, Atlanta police Maj. Jon Gordon
said during the Friday seminar. Gordon is in charge of Olympics planning for the
Atlanta Police Department.

Officials hope that a heightened police presence will deter pickpocketing and
shoplifting, as well as more serious crimes.

During the Games, said Gordon, "If you commit a crime, we're going to arrest
you."

Rathburn said the city and ACOG are going to extraordinary lengths to make sure
safety concerns don't overshadow people's enjoyment of the Games.

"We don't want them to worry about security, and we don't want security to be
the focus of the Games," he said.

New York's Violent Crime Rate Drops to Lows of Early 1970's

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

SECTION: Section 1;   Page 1;   Column 4;   Metropolitan Desk

LENGTH: 1427 words


In a dramatic acceleration of a four-year trend, New York City's crime rate in
1995 registered its steepest drop in 23 years, belying commonly held fears of
wanton violence that were most recently stirred by the deadly assault at a
Harlem clothing store and the killings of five people at a Bronx shoe store.

Coming on the heels of a sharp decline the year before, the rate of violent
crime in New York City is now at its lowest point since the early 1970's.

The trend in New York is not isolated; other big cities, like Houston and San
Diego, have registered similar declines. But New York has seized the attention
of policy makers and criminologists because its decrease has been sustained and
contrasts sharply with increases in nearby cities like Newark, Hartford and
Philadelphia.

A growing number of analysts, who had earlier argued that external factors like
an aging population, longer prison stays and waning violence involving drug
dealers were responsible for the drop, are now willing to concede that new
Police Department strategies are making a substantial impact.

The reduction has been roughly even in rich and poor neighborhoods across the
city, but while a 60 percent decrease in murders on the Upper West Side meant 4
fewer deaths in 1995, a 51 percent decrease in the East New York section of
Brooklyn during the same period meant 44 fewer deaths. Likewise, while a 36
percent decrease in shootings in Park Slope, Brooklyn, meant 6 fewer victims, a
17 percent decrease in the nearby neighborhood of Flatbush meant 24 fewer
victims.

"For many years, minorities have been suffering way out of proportion to their
numbers," Police Commissioner William J. Bratton said. "So they are going to
benefit a lot from the decline in homicides and shootings."

Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said the numbers mean that "a lot of people are safer
and a lot of lives have been saved."

"But most particularly," he said, "it happened in the poorer communities in the
city and in the minority communities."

"This drop exceeds any of the expectations we had when we first started," the
Mayor said. "The real challenge now is to make sure they stay permanent."

The 1,156 slayings reported through Dec. 24 represented the lowest number in
that category of crime since the early 1970's. For the same 51-week period this
year, the 18 percent drop in robbery and 16 percent decline in burglary marked
the lowest levels of reported incidents of those crimes since the late 1960's.

The numbers show that 399 fewer people were killed in the first 51 weeks of
1995, compared with the same period in 1994. Of the seven major crime categories
involving felonies, only first-degree rape did not register a double-digit
percentage drop; it decreased 2 percent.

Murders increased in a handful of New York City's 76 precincts, like the 81st,
which covers parts of Bushwick and Bedford-Stuyvesant. But every precinct
experienced declines in total felonies -- murder, robbery, rape, felony assault,
burglary, grand larceny and auto theft. And over the two-year period since 1993,
every precinct saw double-digit declines in the overall crime rate. It was the
first time since World War II that a consecutive double-digit drop was recorded
citywide.

Marilyn Sanchez, 36, a hairdresser who lives near 207th Street and Post Avenue
in the 34th Precinct in Manhattan, which includes Inwood and northern Washington
Heights, said she was afraid to go out at night "say two or three years ago."

"Now that I feel much safer," she said, "I'll go out as late as midnight to buy
milk at the corner for my daughters." Murders in her precinct have dropped to
18, from 22 last year and 50 in 1993.

But not everyone feels as secure. At a bodega on a cheerless corner at East 152d
Street and Union Avenue in the South Bronx, Sandra Morales, a 35-year-old
cashier, refused to believe crime was going down, noting the steady stream of
crime stories in the newspapers.

Edward Velasquez, a 15-year-old high school student working part-time in the
store, chimed in: "All the time you see cops, threats, kids with guns and drugs.
Every time I go outside, gangs look at me hard. People can't go out without
fear."

But in their precinct, the 40th, murders dropped to 27 this year as of Dec. 24
from 40 last year and from 70 in 1993.

The plunge in violent crime in New York has spurred a vigorous debate among
social scientists about what lies behind what Jeffrey Fagan, a Columbia
University criminologist, calls "this miracle." Prosecutors credit the use of
Federal racketeering statutes, once used only against organized crime, in
breaking up some of the most violent street gangs, and the addition of 5,000
police officers to the department in the last two years.

Experts note that an aging population, longer prison sentences and informal
peace pacts by drug gangs have had an impact. But a growing number of crime
experts are commending Commissioner Bratton.

"New York has enjoyed a significant drop in crime that can't be easily explained
by sociological factors," said Mark H. Moore, a criminologist at Harvard
University. "Therefore, the claim that this might be the result of police
activity looks pretty good."

Mr. Bratton's strategies, leading to a 25 percent increase in misdemeanor and
felony arrests since 1993, include focusing on chop shops and fences to combat
auto theft and burglary, and interrogating suspects in minor crimes for
information about gun and drug trafficking. Anticipating crimes, the department
is redeploying patrol and plainclothes officers to "hot spots" identified
through daily computer mapping of shootings and drug deals.

Under Mr. Bratton, officers walking their beats have been ordered to confront
and issue summonses to people seen committing such minor offenses as drinking
beer in public or vending without a license. The friskings of low-level
offenders has been sharply criticized by some civil libertarians and is one
reason for a two-year jump in abuse complaints, but it apparently has
discouraged people from carrying unregistered guns on the street.

"We are showing that police can change behavior," Mr. Bratton said. "We were
probably the most permissive and tolerant city in America for social deviancy.
Now we're one of the least tolerant cities when it comes to the abuse of public
space."

Whatever the reasons, New York is leading all major cities in drops in murder,
burglary and motor vehicle theft. Ranked by the Justice Department as the 88th
most crime-ridden city out of 183 with populations of 100,000 or more in 1993,
New York dropped to 101 in 1994, and to 136 in the first half of this year
measured on a per capita basis.

And the city is well ahead of others in the region, according to Justice
Department statistics comparing the first six months of the year with the same
period last year.

While the crime rate dropped 16 percent in New York during that period, it
increased by 4 percent in Albany, 1 percent in Rochester and decreased by only 6
percent in Buffalo and 7 percent in Yonkers. In New Jersey, the crime rate
increased by 7 percent in Newark, 10 percent in Elizabeth and 1 percent in
Jersey City, while it decreased by 7 percent in Paterson. In Connecticut, the
rate increased by 5 percent in Hartford, and by 19 percent in both Stamford and
Waterbury. In Philadelphia, crime increased during the first six months of this
year by 5 percent over the same period last year.

Still, people fear for their safety, as even Mayor Giuliani acknowledges. "I
actually believe the impact of decreased crime here is seen better by
outsiders," he said. "New Yorkers will take another six months to accept this."

That change may slowly be under way. Richard S. Curtis, an anthropologist at
John Jay College of Criminal Justice who surveys attitudes toward crime, said
that even in his neighborhood, the Brownsville section of Brooklyn, "two years
ago I used to hear a lot of gunfights right outside my window. But last summer,
I didn't hear a single one."

The 73d Precinct, which covers Brownsville, has experienced some of the city's
biggest declines in crime, including a 62 percent drop in murder since 1993 and
a 56 percent decline in the number of shooting victims. Mr. Curtis said surveys
in his neighborhood and other high-crime communities indicate that local
residents and business owners are feeling the change.

"Some blacks and Hispanics will tell you they don't feel more secure, but I
think there is a groundswell coming," he said. "People are beginning to feel a
lot safer now."

Because of an editing error, an article on Dec. 31 about the drop in violent
crime in New York City referred incorrectly to the corresponding rates in
Hartford and Newark.  While the number of all crimes in those cities increased
during the first six months of 1995 over the same period a year earlier,
according to Justice Department figures, the number of violent crimes decreased.

Number of hate crimes steady in California, but more reported against Latinos
last year

BYLINE: By Matt O'Brien Contra Costa Times

LENGTH: 268 words


The number of hate crimes against Latinos in California spiked by about 47
percent last year after a decade of decline, according to a state report
released Thursday.

Reports of violence and vandalism motivated by bias remained steady in number
last year, but Latinos were victims in more of these crimes. The state attorney
general's office recorded 119 anti-Latino crimes in 2010, up from 81 in 2009,
although the 2009 number was the lowest in at least a decade.

Anti-black bias remains the top motivation for hate crimes, representing about
29 percent of the more than 1,100 hate crimes reported statewide, but the number
of hate crimes against African-Americans has been declining. Also among the most
prevalent, but declining, motivations for hate crimes are anti-gay and
anti-Jewish bias.

"A crime that is motivated by hate is a crime against all people," Attorney
General Kamala Harris said in a statement.

Violent hate crimes also dropped slightly as bias-related property crimes rose.
Fewer were reported at schools and places of worship, but more at restaurants.

San Francisco reported 65 hate crimes, the most in the Bay Area, followed by San
Jose at 24. Livermore, Oakland and the UC Berkeley campus reported 15 hate
crimes each last year.

The report cautioned that many factors can affect the number of hate crimes
reported, including how aggressive local police agencies are in investigating
them and the likelihood of people to report them.

Livermore police Chief Steve Sweeney said almost all of the 15 hate crimes
reported there stemmed from a group of young people that spray painted slurs on
houses.

Amherst ranks as 4th-safest city in U.S.;
Buffalo up 10 spots on 'dangerous' list

BYLINE: FROM STAFF AND WIRE REPORTS

SECTION: LOCAL; Pg. B1

LENGTH: 575 words


The Town of Amherst was ranked fourth among the safest cities in America,
according to a private research group's controversial analysis of annual FBI
crime statistics.

Buffalo, meanwhile, moved up in the ranking of the most dangerous cities in the
country to 24th this year compared to a ranking of the 34th most dangerous city
last year.

The 14th annual "City Crime Rankings: Crime in Metropolitan America" was
published by CQ Press, a unit of Congressional Quarterly Inc.

It is based on the FBI's Sept. 24 crime statistics report.

Amherst dropped two notches from having been ranked the second-safest city last
year, but Supervisor Satish Mohan on Monday said he was pleased that the town
still ranks high among the nation's safest cities.

"We are very much elated by the news and will keep working to make our citizens
as safe as we can," he said.

As an aside, Mohan mentioned that his house alarm went off at 5 a.m. Monday, and
that members of the Amherst Police Department were at his door in 10 minutes. It
turned out to be a false alarm, but he was happy that the police response was so
prompt.

Over the 14 years of the rankings, the town has ranked No. 1 safest six times,
most recently in 2002, the third straight year Amherst was ranked tops.

Buffalo Police Department spokesman Michael J. DeGeorge on Monday said he was
perplexed by Buffalo's jump to the 24th most dangerous city between this year's
and last year's rankings.

"We've seen a steady decline in violent crime in the city for well over the last
year," DeGeorge said. "Last year this time, the number of homicides recorded in
Buffalo was in the high 60s, and at this time, homicides stand at 48."

DeGeorge said he was unaware of the methods used to determine the rankings, but
he heard that CQ Press' annual analysis of FBI crime data has been called into
question.

"We can't worry about some study, controversial or not, that says anything about
violent crime, because this administration has been committed to reducing the
violent crime rate in Buffalo, and there's nobody who can say we haven't done
that," DeGeorge said.

The report looked at 378 cities with at least 75,000 people and its per-capita
rates for homicide, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary and auto theft.
Each crime category was considered separately and weighted based on its
seriousness, according to CQ Press.

Detroit edged past St. Louis, Mo., to become ranked the most dangerous U.S. city
in this year's survey.

Last year's crime leader, St. Louis, fell to No. 2., while Flint, Mich., ranked
third. They were followed, in order, by Oakland, Calif.; Camden, N.J.;
Birmingham, Ala.; North Charleston, S.C.; Memphis, Tenn.; Richmond, Calif.; and
Cleveland. Rochester was ranked the 30th most dangerous city.

The study ranked Mission Viejo, Calif., as the safest U.S. city, followed by
Clarkstown, N.Y.; Brick Township, N.J.; Amherst; and Sugarland, Texas.

Cheektowaga, Erie County's third-largest municipality, is ranked the 58th-safest
city., while Greece, N.Y., outside of Rochester, is ranked the 15th safest city.

The study drew harsh criticism even before it came out. The American Society of
Criminology launched a pre-emptive strike Friday, issuing a statement attacking
it as "an irresponsible misuse" of crime data.

CQ Press spokesman Ben Krasney said details of the weighting system were
proprietary.

Despite gains, city ranks 3rd in crime

BYLINE: ERNIE SUGGS

LENGTH: 1050 words


On the surface, it would seem that Atlanta has very little in common with some
of America's most blighted cities. While there are blocks and blocks of slums in
Baltimore, cranes hover throughout Atlanta like prehistoric beasts, building
gleaming monuments to comfort and wealth.

While Motown has long abandoned Detroit, Atlanta is churning out some of the
best music in the world. And while what colors you wear in Compton near Los
Angeles can be a life-or-death decision, Atlanta has grown into a diverse
international city where blacks, whites, straights, gays, hip-hoppers and good
ol' boys have forged a symbiotic co-existence.

"There are a lot of positive things going on in Atlanta with development,
increased property values and people moving back," said Sgt. John Quigley of the
Atlanta Police Department. "This is a very good time for Atlanta."

So good that the FBI has reported crime is down in Atlanta. But a new report
released in December tells another story.

Morgan Quitno Press, which for the last nine years has ranked the country's
safest and most dangerous cities, listed Atlanta as the third most dangerous
city in the nation for 2002.

Ahead of Atlanta are St. Louis and Detroit. Just behind Atlanta are Gary, Ind.,
Baltimore, Camden, N.J., Compton, Calif., and Flint, Mich. --- a motley crew of
cities if there ever was one.

Among cities with 100,000 to 500,000 people, Atlanta was the second most
dangerous, behind St. Louis. Several majors cities, most notably Chicago, San
Francisco and Alexandria, Va., were not included in the Morgan Quitno ranking
because they did not report complete crime information.

"It is a red flag for cities that should look deeper into their crime problems,"
said Scott Morgan, president of the Kansas-based Morgan Quitno, an independent
private research and publishing company that annually publishes rankings on
topics like safety, education and health care.

In the nine-year history of the study, Atlanta has been one of the most
dangerous cities in the country every year. Before this year's study, the city
of Atlanta was second for three years in a row. The Atlanta metro area, which
includes the surrounding counties, was ranked the 65th out of 271 metro areas.
The port city of Savannah was seventh.

Criminologist weighs in

In determining their safest (Amherst, N.Y.) and most dangerous cities, the
Morgan Quitno study gives equal weight to six crime categories: murder, rape,
robbery, aggravated assault, burglary and motor vehicle theft.

"Criminologists view these kinds of reports with a grain of salt," said Robbie
Friedmann, a Georgia State University criminal justice professor. "We rely on
the Uniform Crime Report. As incomplete as they are, they still provide the best
information out there."

The FBI uses the same categories, as well as larceny, to determine their crime
statistics.

Crime down, FBI says

The latest FBI Uniform Crime Report statistics for the first six months of 2002
showed an actual decline in crime that began in 1997 and is continuing. Serious
crime in Atlanta was down 2 percent in the first half of the year, with a 33
percent drop in homicides and a 15 percent decrease in rapes leading the way.
Police officials predict a 5 percent drop for the second half of the year.

"In comparing ourselves to ourselves we continue to be heading in the right
direction," said Quigley. He called the Morgan Quitno study "misleading." "These
folks capitalize on a ratio that doesn't really tell what is going on. You can
do whatever you want with statistics."

In 2001, there were 52,000 serious crimes in Atlanta. In 2002, that number will
drop by about 2,000 crimes, roughly the same number the city had in 1974. The
population, Quigley said, has also more than doubled over that period.

"We are at the same level as we were in the mid-'70s with the same or fewer
numbers of officers, 10 times more traffic and 600,000 more 911 calls," Quigley
said. "The metro area has grown tremendously and the city feels a great deal of
this growth. Traffic is a reflection of that."

At a Starbucks on Cascade Road in southwest Atlanta, Jane Gilmore Trotter and
her husband, Alvin, sip on $3 cups of coffee and go over reports. He is a
builder and she is a real estate agent. Jane Trotter has lived in Atlanta all of
her life and said she started noticing a change around 1990, when the population
started to boom and traffic got out of hand.

"The crime rate is high because of the growth in Atlanta," said Trotter. "A lot
of people are moving in, so you see more graffiti, more homeless people, more
drugs."

Still, she said she feels safe in the city. So does Alvin Trotter, who moved to
Atlanta in 1988, from Los Angeles, where he learned to look over his shoulder.

"I stay aware of where I am, because I am used to being in a large city. I am
always looking out," he said. "Atlanta is suffering from all of the things that
other big cities suffer with, but I don't think Atlanta has as many problems and
issues as those other cities. Considering the size of Atlanta, I think it is a
safe city."

GSU's Friedmann said that in the crime studies he has done, Atlanta has always
come out on the high end of crime when compared with other cities and "when you
only take city limits and [serious] crimes." The city of Atlanta has a
population of 416,629, which accounts for only 10 percent of the 4 million
people living in the 16-county metro area.

Reaction tied to rank

But Friedmann added that his studies have also shown that crime has continued to
go down, and has little faith in the Morgan Quitno study.

"I must say that unless it is done in a careful scientific method, the private
companies don't seem to be doing a good job," Friedmann said.

Morgan said the esteem in which study results are held often depends on how the
city has ranked. For cities that come out on the safe end, they often use it as
a marketing tool.

But on the flip side: "Governors and mayors say this isn't something we want to
hear about from people from Kansas," said Morgan. "Typically, we are a bunch of
idiots who don't know what we are talking about. I am more impressed with the
folks who say this is an opportunity to do better. Anyone on this list should
not be surprised."

VIOLENT CRIME DECREASES IN ST. PAUL, MINNEAPOLIS;
BOTH CITIES CREDIT STRATEGIES TRACKING 'LIVABILITY CRIMES'

BYLINE: Amy Mayron, Staff Writer

SECTION: LOCAL; Pg. 2B

LENGTH: 228 words


Minneapolis and St. Paul police both reported Wednesday that the cities
experienced decreases in violent crimes last year.

After gathering crime statistics for the FBI's annual Uniform Crime Report, St.
Paul reported a more than 13 percent decrease in violent crime and Minneapolis
reported an 11 percent decrease.

Although the cities tallied their numbers for the federal agency this month, the
FBI won't release its nationwide crime report until May.

Minneapolis also noted a 25 percent drop over the past two years in serious
crimes, including homicide, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, theft
and arson. Minneapolis police officials attribute the drop to its CODEFOR
program.

CODEFOR started in January 1998 and was based on a successful New York City
program. The program's concept attempts to address livability crimes by tracking
crime patterns weekly by computer and holding precinct supervisors accountable
for the trends.

Last year, Minneapolis experienced drops in violent crimes in all crime
categories as well as in all neighborhoods throughout the city.

St. Paul started a program similar to CODEFOR last year. The city had a 39
percent decrease in homicides, a 20 percent decrease in rapes and a 19 percent
decrease in motor vehicle thefts.

PUBLIC HOUSING DRUG, CRIME FIGHT EXPANDED

SECTION: METRO; Briefs; Pg. 2B

LENGTH: 186 words


The Clinton administration widened its fight against crime and drugs in public
housing last week, adding seven cities to a year-old program that targets drug
dealers.

In a White House announcement that also allowed the administration to tout a
nationwide decline in violent crime, Vice President Al Gore said the cities will
be eligible to compete for $250 million in U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development grants.

At the same time, federal prosecutors will team with HUD officials to target
drug dealers in those communities, according to HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo and
Attorney General Janet Reno.

"In public housing, drugs are Public Enemy No. 1," Cuomo said.

The new cities are: Atlanta, Boston, Gary, Ind., Greensboro, N.C., Kansas City,
Mo., Memphis, Tenn., and Newark, N.J.

They join six cities - Chicago, Detroit, New Orleans, Philadelphia, San
Francisco and Washington - that HUD and the Justice Department singled out last
year for the high level of violence in their public housing.

Reno said drug-related arrests in public housing in those cities are up in the
past year.

Crime, violence still at 'intolerable' level in U.S.

BYLINE: By Bill Montgomery STAFF WRITER

SECTION: LOCAL NEWS; Section F; Page 9

LENGTH: 641 words


Atlanta and the South saw an overall drop in crime last year, according to the
FBI, but the nation is more violent and crime-ridden than 10 years ago.

The 1992 Uniform Crime Statistics, released today, show that reported crime last
year was 9 percent higher than in 1983.

Atlanta's total crime rate - including everything from homicide to auto theft -
dipped 8.4 percent from 1991, better than the national drop of 3 percent.

Nationally, the decrease in overall crime was the first annual decline since
1984. But FBI Director Louis Freeh saw little comfort in the statistics.

"Any reduction in reported crime is welcome, but the amount of violent crime and
other grave offenses nationwide remains intolerable," said Freeh, in releasing
the latest figures. Police agencies reported 14.4 million crimes nationwide, an
average of 5,660 crimes for every 100,000 people.

"Crime is shockingly high in a country where the rule of law should prevail,"
Freeh said.

More violent crimes

Atlanta - population 410,876 - recorded roughly 17,350 crimes of all kinds per
100,000 people, compared with 18,953 per 100,000 in 1991.

Despite last year's rate drop, Atlanta residents remained more likely to be
victims of violent crime than residents of any other U.S. city of comparable
size and wealth.

Among 16 cities with 350,000 to 450,000 residents, Atlanta - with a population
of 410,000 - had the highest violent crime rate. It also had the highest violent
crime rate among cities with at least 25 percent of their residents officially
living in poverty.

When property crimes such as burglary were added to violent crimes, Atlanta's
relative crime rate dropped to No. 2, behind Miami. And both cities had far
higher crime rates than larger urban areas like New York, Los Angeles and
Chicago.

Comparisons called misleading

In violent crimes - homicide, rape, robbery and aggravated assault - Atlanta
reported 3,860 per 100,000 residents, leading Miami, Newark, Tampa and St.
Louis.

Atlanta's 1992 violent crimes ran below 1991 rates in every category except
aggravated assault.

Atlanta Police Chief Eldrin Bell contends that comparisons with other cities are
misleading, that the city's thousands of visitors and conventioneers are not
figured in population counts, and reporting standards vary from city to city.

"I've found more and more that we report our crime more accurately," Bell said.
"The statistics are no better than the people sending them, and a lot of people
want their figures to look good."

'Lessened a little'

Atlanta's crime rate fell for a second consecutive year in a row in 1992; crime
figures for 1991 were 6 percent lower than 1990 figures.

"Crime does seem to have lessened a little in the past two years but remember
it's declined from a much higher number, that police say was aggravated by the
crack cocaine epidemic, which began about 1984," said Roy Hanson, deputy
director of the Metro Atlanta Crime Commission.

Nationwide, all regions except the West showed decreases in the total number of
crimes last year - 6 percent in the Northeast, 5 percent in the Midwest, and 3
percent in the South. The West increased less than 1 percent.

The report also noted:

Violent crime reported to police exceeded 1.9 million offenses last year, an
increase of 1 percent.

Murder was down 4 percent and robbery 2 percent; rape and aggravated assault
increased by 2 percent and 3 percent.

Of nearly 24,000 murder victims, 78 percent were men and 50 percent were black.
Ninety percent of the offenders were male.

Firearms were used in 31 percent of all murders, robberies and aggravated
assaults.

Of the 14 million people arrested in 1992 for other than traffic violations, the
highest count, 1.6 million, were for driving under the influence.

Violent crime rises slightly in city

BYLINE: Sonja Elmquist, News & Record, Greensboro, N.C.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 560 words


Jan. 13--GREENSBORO -- Three North Carolina cities including Greensboro defied a
national and regional trend of declining violent crime in the first half of
2008, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Violent crime in Greensboro increased by 3.1 percent, a smaller increase than
experienced by Charlotte, Raleigh or Fayetteville, according to the FBI's
"Preliminary Semiannual Uniform Crime Report," released Monday.

"Overall, I think Greensboro looks good," said Capt. Janice Rogers, commander of
the department's criminal investigation division. "We have an increase, but not
as much of an increase as some of these other cities."

The report included data volunteered by cities with more than 100,000 in
population.

Charlotte/Mecklenburg County reported an 8.4 percent increase in violent crime,
Raleigh reported a 12.4 percent increase and Fayetteville reported a 21.7
percent increase.

Cary reported a 3 percent decline in violent crime.

Data from Winston-Salem and Durham were not included in the report.

Reports of rape in Greensboro more than doubled in the first half of 2008
compared to the same period in 2007. Aggravated assaults increased by 3.1
percent, while both robberies and homicides declined.

Rogers said the data in the FBI report may be slightly misleading because the
agency does not remove crimes from their counts if police agencies later
determine the crime report to be unfounded.

Many of the rapes Greensboro police reported to the FBI turn out to be unfounded
after an investigation, Rogers said.

The nation as a whole saw a 3.5 percent decline in violent crime, and the South
saw a

1.5 percent decline from January to June 2008, compared to the same period in
2007, according to an FBI news release. Nationwide, there was a 2.5 percent
decline in property crime for that period.

Greensboro reported a 4.2 percent increase in property crimes, led by an 8
percent increase in the "larceny-theft" category, which includes shoplifting and
thefts from vehicles. Motor vehicle thefts were down nearly 15 percent, and
Greensboro reported 12.3 percent fewer arsons. Burglaries increased by 2.2
percent.

"It looks like the other cities are up in the exact same crimes as us," Rogers
said. "There's no true comparison because Winston-Salem and Durham don't put
data in there," she said

A decline in the number of homicides and robberies in Greensboro in the first
half of 2008 was offset by an increase in the number of rapes and aggravated
assaults.

Rapes in the first half of 2008 increased by nearly 60 percent, to 59 reports.
Greensboro reported 37 rapes in the first half of 2007.

Property crime in Greensboro increased by 4.2 percent. That increase is less
than the Charlotte area, which saw a 7.5 percent increase, but more than
Raleigh, which experienced a 1.7 percent increase, and Fayetteville, which had a
3.8 percent decrease in property crimes.

TERROR IN LITTLETON: THE WEAPONS;
Most Crime Guns Are Bought, Not Stolen

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD

SECTION: Section A; Page 26; Column 3; National Desk

LENGTH: 920 words


The teen-agers who killed 12 of their classmates and a teacher last week in
Colorado got their guns the way most violent juveniles and adult criminals get
theirs: by purchasing them from gun dealers or at gun shows or by buying them
using friends as intermediaries, law enforcement officials and criminologists
say.

The idea that juveniles and adult criminals buy their weapons, usually new guns,
from legitimate sources is a finding developed only in the past three years and
contradicts what had been the widely accepted view, that they steal their guns,
usually older weapons. The traditional view, still advocated by the National
Rifle Association, was that because criminals steal their weapons and because
there are an estimated 230 million guns in America, there is little anyone can
do to stop people from getting access to guns for crimes.

But, David Kennedy, a senior researcher at the John F. Kennedy School of
Government at Harvard University, said the new finding "is a quiet revolution
that means law enforcement now has practical ways to go after illegal guns."
Police departments in several cities, including Boston, New York, Baltimore and
Los Angeles, now target the illegal sale of guns the way police have long
cracked down on drugs, and the campaigns are credited with sharp drops in
violent crime.

The recognition that juveniles and criminals buy their guns comes as a result of
tracing guns seized in crimes by the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms, an effort largely begun during the Clinton Administration.

The firearms bureau reported in February that about a third of guns used in
crimes by juveniles were manufactured within the past three years, and half of
all guns illegally acquired by young people involved straw buyers, either
friends of the offenders or organized rings of gun traffickers.

In another new finding, Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York,
reported today that 1 percent of Federally licensed firearms dealers sold nearly
half of the guns traced to crimes in 1998.

Using data gathered by the firearms bureau, Mr. Schumer found that although
about 80 percent of the 104,000 licensed gun dealers did not have a single crime
gun traced to their stores last year, 1,160 dealers were the source of 34,626
guns seized in crimes. And 0.1 percent of the dealers, or 137 of them, accounted
for more than 13,000 guns traced to crimes in 1998. Some of these dealers each
sold more than 1,000 guns that were used in crimes from 1996 through 1998.

"It is clear that a few bad apples are supplying the lion's share of guns to
criminals," Mr. Schumer said. "This will allow us to focus on the bad dealers
and choke off the pathway of guns as they move from legitimate commerce to
children."

A dealer in West Milwaukee, for example, sold 1,195 guns used in crimes in the
past three years, the data showed, while one in Riverdale, Ill., a Chicago
suburb, was the source of 1,176 crime guns. The firearms bureau did not provide
the dealers' names, under the terms of the law allowing it to trace crime guns.

Mr. Schumer and President Clinton have both proposed legislation that would give
the firearms bureau more authority to crack down on so-called dirty dealers,
stores that either knowingly sell to criminals or that straw buyers have learned
will sell guns without asking too many questions. One of their proposals would
allow the bureau to conduct more than the current limit of one inspection per
year of a gun dealer's records.

Another proposal would permit the firearms bureau to temporarily suspend the
license of dealers who sold guns used in crimes without going through a
time-consuming hearing process.

As further examples of the problem, Mr. Schumer said that 15 dealers in Indiana
were the source of 5,119 crime guns from 1996 through 1998, 10 dealers in
Illinois accounted for 4,287 guns used in crimes during that period, and 15
dealers in Georgia were the source of 3,726 crime guns in three years.
Similarly, one dealer in Carson City, Nev., supplied 326 guns used in crimes in
1998, all but two committed outside Nevada.

Gun tracing by the firearms bureau has revealed that three of the four guns used
in the attack at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., were purchased at
Denver-area gun shows by Robyn Anderson, the 18-year-old girlfriend of Dylan
Klebold, one of the killers, the Jefferson County sheriff's office said. When
she then provided the weapons -- two sawed off Savage shotguns and a Hi-Point
9-millimeter semiautomatic carbine -- to the teen-agers, she was acting as what
one Firearms Bureau agent described today as "a classic straw purchaser."

Young men who are under 18, the legal age to buy handguns, or are barred from
purchasing because they have a criminal record, often recruit their girlfriends
to buy for them, the agent said. Straw purchasing is a violation of Federal law,
and, in many states, a violation of local law.

The firearms bureau has long tracked guns used in notorious crimes, but as more
police agencies recognize the importance of gun tracing, the number of guns the
bureau traces has climbed to 194,235 guns in 1997, up from 37,181 in 1990. Some
dealers with troubled histories do not keep their records, agents say, making
tracing more difficult. But as the bureau has become increasingly successful at
gun tracing, the National Rifle Association through its supporters in Congress
has mounted an effort to get it to purge some of its gun tracing data base.

METRO NEWS BRIEFS: NEW JERSEY;
State's Crime Rate Falls For Fifth Straight Year

SECTION: Section B; Page 8; Column 5; Metropolitan Desk

LENGTH: 172 words

DATELINE: TRENTON


The state's crime rate fell for the fifth straight year in 1997, by 7 percent,
and the total number of reported crimes was the lowest since 1973, according to
figures released yesterday.

There were 40.9 crimes for every 1,000 residents last year, compared with 43.8
in 1996, the New Jersey Uniform Crime Report showed. The total number of crimes
fell 6 percent, from 346,094 to 326,912, said John Hagerty, a state police
spokesman. Violent crimes, including rape, murder, robbery and aggravated
assault, fell 7 percent, from 42,420 in 1996 to 39,652 last year.

In a statement, Peter Verniero, the State Attorney General, gave the credit for
the drop to tough sanctions against criminals and innovative law enforcement.
But the drop might also be explained by shifting demographics, said Nathaniel J.
Pallone, a professor at Rutgers School of Criminal Justice in Newark. Men
between 18 and 30 years old are most likely to commit violent crimes, he said,
and their ranks thinned by 1.5 percent between 1997 and 1996.

JERSEY CRIME UP 5% LAST YEAR

BYLINE: AP

SECTION: Section B; Page 4, Column 3; Metropolitan Desk

LENGTH: 198 words

DATELINE: NEWARK, July 27


New Jersey's overall crime rate rose more than 5 percent last year - the first
increase since 1980 - according to F.B.I. figures.

The New Jersey statistics were included in an annual report by the Federal
Bureau of Investigation on reported crime released Saturday on nationwide crime
in city's with at least 10,000 residents.

The report showed increases in violent and property crimes in New Jersey, but
car thefts led all offenses with a 16 percent rise.

In other categories, murders in New Jersey increased 1 percent; robberies,
almost 6 percent, and aggravated assaults, 3 percent. However, the number of
sexual assaults dropped almost 1 percent.

Crime rates rose in four of the state's largest cities, with Newark's increase
the largest at 20 percent. The crime rate rose by 7 percent in Elizabeth, 8
percent in Jersey City and 4 percent in Paterson.

In Trenton, the only major city in the state that recorded a decrease, the crime
rate dropped 8 percent, the report said.

Nationwide, the number of crimes reported to the police increased by the same
amount as New Jersey - 5 percent - the first annual increase in the nationwide
statistics since 1981, the F.B.I. said.

U.S. OFFICIALS CITE KEY SUCCESSES IN WAR AGAINST ORGANIZED CRIME

BYLINE: By LESLIE MAITLAND WERNER, Special to the New York Times

SECTION: Section A; Page 1, Column 2; National Desk

LENGTH: 3063 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 6


Justice Department officials say they have won many significant battles in the
last two or three years in a decades-old war against organized crime. In all
major cities where traditional organized crime exists, they say, most of the top
leaders are either in prison or facing charges.

''It's the greatest achievement we've had in organized crime,'' said Floyd I.
Clarke, deputy assistant director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's
criminal investigative division. ''In every city where there is a major
organized crime family, we have indicted and/or convicted the top echelons of
that family, and that's all within the past few years.''

But Mr. Clarke, as well as outside experts who share his assessment, caution
that organized crime is still a serious problem and that it continues to operate
while leaders are in jail. To suppress it, they say, the recent gains will have
to be sustained for a long period.



Successes Developed Gradually

Nevertheless, in New Orleans, Los Angeles and Cleveland, the entire leadership
of crime families has been imprisoned for long terms, Mr. Clarke said. Sweeping
cases have also been brought in New York, Boston, Cleveland, Chicago, Denver,
Kansas City, Florida, Detroit, Philadelphia, California, Milwaukee and
Louisiana.

''These successes have not been an overnight creation,'' said David Margolis,
chief of the Justice Department's Organized Crime and Racketeering Section,
''but have gradually developed with innovations in law enforcement.''

The innovations and legislation introduced by each Administration since
President Kennedy's are only now starting to show major effects, Mr. Margolis
and other officials say.

The assessment that the war against organized crime, while far from over, is
showing heightened results comes from career Justice Department employees, not
political appointees, and their view is supported by experts outside the
Government.

''The cases that have been made recently are incredibly significant - it's
incredible,'' said G. Robert Blakey, a professor at the Notre Dame Law School
who was in the Justice Department in the Kennedy Administration and served as
chief counsel for the Senate subcommittee that processed key organized crime
legislation in the late 1960's.

''It's too early to predict the demise of the Mafia,'' he said, ''but if this
can be sustained for another decade, where the leadership structure is taken out
and then their successors are taken, we can decimate this particular aspect of
organized crime. I think this could be the beginning of the end for the Mafia.
I'm very encouraged.''

Professor Blakey, Mr. Clarke and other officials in the F.B.I. and in the
Justice Department's Organized Crime Section attribute improvement to several
factors, most dating back a decade.  Under Clarence Kelley in the mid- 1970's,
they said, the F.B.I. shifted its effort toward ''quality'' cases with a new
emphasis on organized crime, rather than on statistical volume. The bureau now
devotes about a quarter of its work force to organized crime.

Further, there has been improved use of sophisticated laws enacted in the
1970's, such as the Racketeer-Influenced Corrupt Organization statute, called
RICO, which permits a single prosecution for a series of crimes and can give the
Federal Government jurisdiction for state offenses, including murder. In
September, for instance, the Justice Department named seven men as leaders of a
racketeering enterprise in Boston whose activities included murder and gambling.

The experts point to more effective use of electronic surveillance, including
wiretaps and hidden microphones, that is now aimed less at solving individual
crimes and more at gathering evidence against top-ranking criminals.

Telephone wiretaps helped obtain the first felony conviction of Joseph Bonanno
Sr., the founder of a crime family in New York; he was found guilty in San
Francisco in 1980 of conspiring to thwart a grand jury investigation.

Undercover Agents And Informers Used

Also, around 1974 the F.B.I. began using undercover agents in long-term
investigations. In New York, for example, an F.B.I. agent posing as a gangster
infiltrated the Bonanno family, resulting in the conviction last year of three
''captains'' on racketeering charges.

High-level informers also were developed, partly as a result of the creation in
1970 of the Federal Witness Protection Program. For instance, Aladena James
Fratianno, once a boss and executioner in the Los Angeles family, agreed to
cooperate with the Government, testifying against former associates in
Cleveland, Los Angeles and New York.

Another factor cited as an improvement is the pooling of resources by
once-competing law enforcement agencies in geographically based strike forces
under specially trained prosecutors. For instance, state and Federal agencies
working together to investigate a dozen killings in a Cleveland gang war
obtained the convictions last year of all the top leaders of the Cleveland
Mafia, the officials say.

And, the F.B.I. was given jurisdiction in narcotics cases for the first time and
began to work jointly with the Drug Enforcement Administration.

According to Roger S. Young, assistant director of the bureau in charge of
public affairs, the F.B.I. has hired about 500 additional agents in the last two
years, which has also helped in the effort against organized crime.

He explained that when priorities were reordered in the bureau a few years ago,
it reduced its attention to cases involving individual automobile thefts and
bank robberies. The local authorities ''have picked up a significant portion of
those burdens,'' he said.

Commissioner McGuire Lists Improvements

In New York, still the home of five of the strongest organized crime families,
Police Commissioner Robert J. McGuire sees a ''renewed sense of commitment'' to
fighting the problem.

''Law enforcement is more willing to test the limits of what can be done now,''
he said. ''There is more willingness to cooperate between agencies, to use RICO,
to use wiretaps and undercover - all positive things that heretofore we were not
seeing.

''I think we've made a lot of progress, but we were coming from way back in the
race. The danger now is to make believe you've accomplished more than you have.
This effort has to be sustained for a long period before you can truly say
they're on the run.''

Mr. Clarke of the F.B.I. agreed, while adding that recent statistics showed
signs of substantial improvement. In 1981, he said, the bureau listed 515
organized crime convictions and in 1982, 763. But for 1983, it estimates it will
attain 1,300, a large number of them stemming from narcotics cases.

''But we are not in the position where we believe we have eradicated the
problem,'' Mr. Clarke said. The bureau believes 24 traditional organized crime
families are still operating in the United States, he said. The families are
believed to be loosely grouped together in what the gangsters call La Cosa
Nostra, literally ''our thing'' or ''our work'' in Italian.

These do not include new, growing groups such as motorcycle gangs, narcotics
cartels and gangs of various ethnic backgrounds that are of increasing concern
to law enforcement officials, Mr. Clarke said.

The emergence of new types of organized crime was one reason given by President
Reagan this year for naming a Commission on Organized Crime. He said he hoped it
would collect information on the extent and operation of these new groups, about
which the authorities say they know very little.

The commission is headed by Judge Irving R. Kaufman of the United States Court
of Appeals for the Second Circuit, who presided at the trial of 20 Mafia figures
who attended the organized crime convention in Apalachin, N.Y., in 1957.

According to Oliver B. Revell, the assistant director in charge of the bureau's
criminal investigative division, that meeting marked the beginning of the
bureau's interest in organized crime.

''Before that, we didn't even know it was called La Cosa Nostra,'' Mr. Revell
said, adding that J. Edgar Hoover, then the bureau's Director, believed that
''localized criminal activity of a vice nature'' was better left to the state
and local authorities.

But in the 1960's, Mr. Revell said, the bureau became aware that organized crime
had a national scope and operated under a hierarchy with interrelationships and
an internal government with a means to resolve disputes.

''We began to made periodic prosecutions, but mostly on the street or
mid-level,'' Mr. Revell said.

When Robert F. Kennedy was Attorney General from 1961 to 1963, he expanded the
Organized Crime and Racketeering Section, formed in 1954, from 17 lawyers to 63.
But the Congressional Quarterly Service reports that between 1960 and 1969, ''of
5,000 known or suspected organized crime figures, only 257 were indicted.''

Mr. Margolis, who has headed the department section since 1979, said major
legislative changes began in 1961, when Congress made interstate travel or
telephone calls to promote racketeering a Federal crime. In 1968 the Justice
Department obtained the authority to seek court orders for wiretapping and
bugging to investigate suspected criminal offenses.

As an example of the usefulness of such evidence, a Justice Department internal
report says there were taps on the phones used when ''Kansas City boss Nicholas
Civella discussed the bribery of a Federal prison warden'' and when ''Joe
Bonanno discussed obstructing a grand jury investigation.''

Mr. Margolis said the Justice Department broadened its efforts after the
Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 provided tools for an expanding group of
Organized Crime Strike Forces across the country.

There are now 14 of these task forces totaling 141 lawyers as special
prosecutors, supervised by Mr. Margolis. The teams also include representatives
of the F.B.I., the D.E.A., the Internal Revenue Service, the Secret Service, the
Labor Department, the Postal Service, the Customs Service, the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the Immigration and Naturalization Service and
the local police.

The Organized Crime Control Act, which included the RICO provision, also gave
the Federal authorities the means to seize the assets of criminal enterprises.
As prosecutors have become more familiar with using the statute, moreover, they
have started directly charging defendants with participating in a criminal
organization, La Cosa Nostra.

5,000 Become Protected Witnesses

To lessen fear of testifying against organized crime, the Federal Witness
Protection Program was established. This program, in which the Government
relocates endangered witnesses and may even give them new identities, has
encouraged testimony not just from innocent victims, but from several organized
crime leaders themselves, officials say.

According to Gerald Shur, senior associate director of the Justice Department's
office of enforcement operations, 5,000 people have been placed in the Witness
Protection Program.

''All four of the principal witnesses against Frank Tieri were protected
Government witnesses,'' the internal Justice Department report says, referring
to the boss of the Genovese crime family in New York. Mr. Tieri, the first
person successfully prosecuted by the Federal Government on charges of being a
crime boss, was convicted in 1980 of racketeering.

One of the four witnesses, Mr. Fratianno, the former Los Angeles family
underboss, also testified in a trial there in 1980 that resulted in the
conviction of its top crime leaders, including family boss Dominick Brooklier,
underboss Samuel Sciortino and the family counselor. Mr. Fratianno and two other
protected witnesses also testified against the Cleveland mob figure Anthony
Liberatore, who was found guilty last year of bribing an F.B.I. clerk for a list
of the bureau's informants.

In some of these cases, the authorities relied on a combination of methods. For
instance, the Justice Department report says, Joseph Cantalupo, a protected
witness, tape-recorded conversations he had with subordinates of Mr. Tieri and
another major crime figure in New York.

Highest Levels Are InfiltratedUndercover agents, whom the bureau began using
less than 10 years ago to investigate stolen property rings, have become
increasingly skillful.

For instance, Joseph Pistone, the agent who infiltrated the highest circles of
the Bonanno family in New York, assured subjects of an undercover operation in
Florida the F.B.I. had set up in a roadhouse gambling casino that agents were
safe to deal with. With videotape cameras hidden behind the walls, the bureau
gained evidence that led to the indictment this year of Santo Trafficante Jr.,
the Florida family's chief, and 10 other reputed crime figures on charges of
racketeering in a fight for control of the trash- hauling business.

The operation also gained evidence relating to the murders of three capos in New
York's Bonanno family, which resulted in several convictions.

Similarly, in Milwaukee, Mr. Pistone vouched for an undercover operation that
helped win the conviction earlier this month of the top organized crime leader
there, Frank P. Balestrieri, on charges of running an illegal betting ring.

Another undercover operation succeeded in obtaining convictions of the entire
ruling hierarchy of the Los Angeles crime family in 1980.

In this case, Frank Bompensiero, a leader of the San Diego crime family who was
an F.B.I. informer, brought his criminal associates into the web of the bureau's
sting operation, which included a bogus pornography business.

Mr. Bompensiero was slain after his role was discovered, but the convictions
that resulted create ''reason to believe the Los Angeles family may be crippled
for years to come,'' according to the Justice Department report.

Inner Workings Of La Cosa Nostra

From intelligence provided by undercover agents and through electronic
surveillance, the bureau has been learning a great deal about the inner workings
of La Cosa Nostra, Mr. Clarke said.

The bureau now believes that the 24 groups of Sicilian or other Italian origin
include about 2,000 ''made'' or formally inducted members and about 10 active
associates for every made member, he said. As in the past, he added, the
families of La Cosa Nostra based in major cities still take orders from the five
based in New York, and while the families sometimes battle one another, at other
times they offer assistance.

Carlos Marcello, reputed head of organized crime in the Gulf Coast region, for
instance, was convicted along with Mr. Sciortino, the Los Angeles underboss, of
trying to bribe the trial judge in the case against Mr. Sciortino and other
leaders of the Los Angeles group. Evidence of the unsuccessful scheme was
obtained in the course of the bureau's undercover Brilab investigation, in which
agents posed as corrupt insurance salesman.

Disputes among families and policy matters are determined by a national
commission, Mr. Clarke said, and the board is believed to comprise a boss from
each New York family, as well as one from Chicago, Detroit, Buffalo and
Philadelphia.

''Its composition is subject to debate, even within the bureau,'' said Sean
McWeeney, the F.B.I. section chief in charge of organized crime. ''But the
commission is still active. It's been afraid to meet in the last several years,
but we think it uses a courier system.''

The families' other criminal pursuits have remained fairly stable. Recent cases
have shown continued involvement in gambling, narcotics, prostitution,
pornography, entertainment, labor unions, construction, trucking, loan-sharking,
vending machines, garbage, toxic waste, banking, stock fraud, insurance and
extortion.

Bureau officials say they believe organized crime is responsible for importing
85 percent of the heroin now entering the United States through New York from
laboratories mostly in Sicily.

With the new jurisdiction in narcotics cases, the bureau is already involved in
1,600 drug investigations, Mr. Clarke said.

But Mr. Revell of the F.B.I. insists: ''You don't put organized crime out of
business simply by convicting the bosses.

''Even in prison, they have access to lawyers, family, visitors, phones,
uncensored mail. So many have continued to run their businesses while in jail.''

A wiretap on a pay telephone in the Federal Penitentiary at Leavenworth, he
recalled, found Nicholas Civella, a Kansas City crime boss, conducting business
almost as usual.

''We started by trying to get as many convictions as possible,'' Mr. Revell
said. ''But we found that did not provide a significant impact. Then we went
after the bosses, but that's not the whole answer either. Now we're going after
their profits and tangible assets. But organized crime will continue to exist as
long as there is a demand for the services that they provide.''

And yet some officials, including former Associate Attorney General Rudolph W.
Giuliani, who is now the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New
York, maintain that La Cosa Nostra drew its initial strength from a basically
immigrant population that has since advanced within the American society.

''The old-timers are not easily replaceable,'' Mr. Giuliani said. ''The founders
are now dying off, and we're dealing with the second, third and fourth level.
They are not able to replenish themselves the way they could before. The ones
they would have recruited are now in college and law school.''

Indeed, many of the crime leaders convicted in recent years are elderly, and
others indicted have been too old or ill to stand trial. And there are signs of
reduced recruitment. Agents who eavesdropped on a conversation among organized
crime leaders in Cleveland, for instance, heard them complaining that there
would be no one to lead the family while they were in prison because of their
failure to recruit and promote new members.

''Demographics are on our side with regard to the Italian-American community,''
Mr. Giuliani insisted. ''But I think new groups will take their place. And if we
don't pay attention early, we'll wind up in the same situation we were in 20
years ago, when, not having admitted the existence of the Mafia for so many
years, we were a couple of generations behind in catching up and stopping
them.''

The persistence of American hate crime; While the number of active hate groups
in the U.S. has fallen in recent years, the hate-crime rate remains steady and
blacks remain the racial group most likely to experience racially motivated
violence. After Wednesday night's mass shooting in Charleston, S.C., the
Washington Post offers some context on hate crimes and hate groups from the
Southern Poverty Law Center, the FBI and other sources

SECTION: WORLD; Pg. A20

LENGTH: 526 words


Blacks experience the most hate crime FBI hate-crime data show that more than 50
out of every one million black citizens was the victim of a racially motivated
hate crime in 2012, the highest among any racial group.

But this is almost certainly an undercount. The FBI is reliant on state and
local law enforcement agencies to categorize and report hate crimes correctly.

Some agencies do a much better job of this than others, and there is general
agreement that the FBI numbers are significantly lower than they should be.

Hate-crime rates stable over the past decade The Bureau of Justice Statistics
provides the most comprehensive overall count of hate-crime incidents.

Their data, drawn from interviews with victims, shows the number of hate crimes
occurring has remained fairly constant over the past 10 years, hovering between
200,000 and 300,000 annually.

Number of active hate groups down in recent years.

According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, the number of active hate groups,
which it defines as "groups have beliefs or practices that attack or malign an
entire class of people, typically for their immutable characteristics," more
than doubled from 457 in 1999 to 1018 in 2011. Since then the number of active
groups has declined to 784. The SPLC attributes this to various causes -
including an improving economy and recent law enforcement crackdowns, as well as
widespread internecine squabbling and splintering within the groups themselves.

Hate groups concentrated in Deep South, Northern Plains Hate groups aren't
distributed evenly by geography. Controlling for the population in each state,
hate groups are concentrated most in the Deep South and in the Montana/Idaho
region. Vermont and New Hampshire also stand out.

Partially, this is a function of low population - Vermont has fewer than 700,000
residents, which combined with its four active hate groups gives it a high
per-capita value.

But this may not just be an artifact of low population. Researchers at Humboldt
State University recently mapped geocoded tweets containing hate speech, and
their map does appear to show a high incidence of hate-tweets originating in
Vermont.

Hardship breeds hatred Researchers have tried to suss out the causes of hate
crime over the years. A 2002 review of hate crime literature by Princeton
economist Alan Krueger looked at the economic determinants of hate crime -
whether these crimes rose and fell in response to economic conditions like
poverty rate and unemployment.

Krueger concludes that "rather than economic conditions, the hate crimes
literature points to a breakdown in law enforcement and official sanctioning and
encouragement of civil disobedience as significant causes of the occurrence of
hate crimes."

Not so fast, say economists Matt Ryan and Peter Leeson. In 2010 they examined
the links between hate groups and hate crime in the United States. Perhaps
surprisingly, they find no relationship between the number of hate groups in a
state, and the number of hate crimes that occur within that state in a given
year.

Instead, the primary determinants seem to be economic. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2015

Benicia listed among state's 50 safest cities

ABSTRACT

A new report names Benicia as one of California's top 50 safetst cities. The
area's other cities didn't fare as well.

FULL TEXT

Benicia ranks among California's 50 safest cities, according to a new report by
ValuePenguin.

Solano and Napa counties' other included cities didn't fare as well, in the
report that ranks 417 cities based mostly on crime statistics.

Benicia's economic development office's Teri Davena said city officials plan to
share this information with residents and visitors.

Some might argue that population size can skew such crime numbers-based studies,
but ValuePenguin officials say they've accounted for that.

"Although we adjusted for population in our crime rankings, it is still
difficult to compare a small town to a large city," the study's authors said.
"To account for this fact, we separated the safest cities into three categories:
towns with populations between 5,000 and 20,000, midsize cities with populations
between 20,000 and 50,000, and larger cities with populations greater than
50,000." Each city's population and violent and property crime per 100,000
people was analyzed.

With a crime score of 103, Hillsborough (San Mateo County) is the state's safest
city, according to ValuePenguin. It reported no violent crimes and just 57
property crimes to the FBI in 2013, the most recent statistics available.

On the opposite end of the spectrum, ValuePenguin found 417-ranked Oakland, with
a crime score of 6,735.

Vallejo, Fairfield, Suisun City, Vacaville, Napa, Dixon, Rio Vista and even
Benicia fall in between.

Vallejo ranked 406, with a worse than average crime score of 3,195.

The average crime score is 1,290, the reports' authors said.

Fairfield ranked 346, with a crime score of 1,860. At No. 266, Rio Vista
registered a 1,358 crime score, while Napa's 220 ranking registered a 1,152
crime score.

American Canyon ranked 197, with a 1,067 crime score, followed by Vacaville at
No. 179 with a crime score of 1,030. Suisun City ranked 151 and Dixon, 128.
Benicia's 46 ranking, with its crime score of 526, is this area's lowest.

Some of the cities with crime stats that fell between Oakland's and Vallejo's -
in other words, cities with crime scores worse than Vallejo's but better than
Oakland's - included Modesto, Richmond, Compton, San Francisco, Stockton, and
Emeryville.

ValuePenquin officials said they created the report to help people figure out
where they might want to live (or avoid living) within California.

"When deciding where to live, safety is a top priority," they said in the
study's explanation. "Our team at ValuePenguin has analyzed the most recent FBI
Crime Report to determine the safety of cities in California. These 417 ranged
in a crime score from 103 to almost 7,000 with an average of 1,290."

Sacramento, fell to No. 399 in the rankings with a crime score of 2,744, despite
crime score metrics being adjusted for population size, officials said.

"The score also took into account both the amount of violent and
property-related crimes per 100,000 people," they said.  The raw data report
included property crimes (burglary, larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft, and
arson), and violent crimes (murder/manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery and
aggravated assault) from all law enforcement agencies that participated in the
FBI Uniform Crime Reporting program, the authors said.

Report pegs Oakland with country's third-highest crime rate; Richmond ranked
14th

OAKLAND   Oakland had the third-highest crime rate in the United States in 2008,
according to a publishing company's annual report on crime in American cities.

CQ Press' widely followed but controversial rankings were released over the
weekend and put Oakland among the country's five highest-crime cities for the
third consecutive year. Richmond ranked No. 14.

Oakland moved up two spots after ranking No. 5 in last year's report and No. 4
in 2007. Each year's report is based on crime data from the previous calendar
year.

Oakland's No. 3 ranking came despite a dip in reports of serious crime by about
3 percent from 2007 to 2008.

What is not reflected in the report is that Oakland is experiencing a more
significant drop in crime this year. As of Nov. 11, reports of serious crime
were down 13 percent in 2009 compared with the same point in 2008, while
homicides had dropped 17 percent.

Even with the decline, Oakland police Chief Anthony Batts, who began Oct. 19,
repeatedly has called the city's crime rate "unacceptable" and even "an
outrage."

"The level of carnage that takes place in this city to me is abhorrent, is an
outrage in a city of this size," he said last week. "My passion is trying to
stop the level of murders, homicides and deaths in this city if I possibly can."

Mayor Ron Dellums said in a statement that the city "is making progress in
bringing peace to our streets"   noting that violence is down this year after he
set a goal of reducing crime by at least 10 percent.

The mayor also questioned the credibility of the report. The CQ Press rankings
regularly draw fire from mayors and law-enforcement officials nationwide. The
U.S. Conference of Mayors ripped the report again this year, calling it
"misleading and a disservice to the public."

The company relies on FBI statistics, and in 2007 the FBI attacked the report,
saying the "rough rankings provide no insight into the numerous variables that
mold crime in a particular town, city, county, state or region."

In a statement, CQ Press acknowledged the controversy but suggested that
criticisms are "largely based on the fact that there are reasons for the
differences in crime rates, not that the rates are incompatible."

The rankings are calculated using six categories of crime: murder, rape,
robbery, aggravated assault, burglary and vehicle theft.

"Annual rankings not only allow for comparisons among different states and
cities, but also enable leaders to track their communities' crime trends from
one year to the next," CQ Press said in its statement.

Topping this year's list as the highest crime city was Camden, N.J. After Camden
came St. Louis; Oakland; Detroit; and Flint, Mich.

Richmond ranked No. 9 in each of the past two years before dropping to No. 14.

"Last year, crime was down," said Richmond police Chief Chris Magnus. "And this
year, though our homicide total has increased, our total crime is actually down
11 percent."

Tell the truth about crime rates in Durham

BYLINE: MIKE WEST Columnist

SECTION: EDITORIAL; Pg. A9

LENGTH: 725  words


The ongoing Duke men's lacrosse case investigation has brought out a plethora of
homegrown marketing initiatives to counter the national media's alleged unfair
portrayal of Durham as a troubled and crime-ridden blue collar town with
significant racial tension and an elite Duke University in its midst. It seems
not a week goes by that some apologist or cheerleader from the local Chamber of
Commerce or newspaper publishes yet another column about the need to better
market Durham's image.

Reading and taking at face value all the marketing spin ink devoted to
bolstering Durham's media image would lead readers to conclude that either
Durham is the most misunderstood and falsely portrayed community on the planet
Earth or there may actually be some underlying truth to these unflattering
characteristics of this "City of Medicine."

The latest propaganda comes from the Durham Convention and Visitor's Bureau
(DCVB) in a publication titled, "25 Common Misperceptions about Durham and the
Realities behind Them." The purpose of the brochure reads like a true marketing
spin document since it offers "ready responses to re-inform misinformed comments
and misinformation about Durham." So all you misinformed persons out there get
ready to be re-informed of all the Durham misinformation! Got that?

"Common misperception #14: Durham has a high crime rate."

This "misperception" caught my eye since I have been the victim of crime twice
in Durham. Also, a house around the corner from mine was broken into during
broad daylight. Now of course, that is my experience only and does not
necessarily scale to the greater crime picture in Durham.

But, now read carefully the DCVB answer. "Reality: Durham's crime rate is at or
below average for a cohort of 9 Southeast and 28 national communities of similar
size and makeup." DCVB is reporting an "average" crime ranking which is of
itself a meaningless statistic. People are not victims of "average" crimes, but
of actual ones. Much more meaningful crime statistics are the actual number of
crime offenses for selected cities in North Carolina. It is very enlightening
when one compares crime offenses in Durham to its surrounding neighbors.

The North Carolina Department of Justice published an annual summary report
titled "Crime in North Carolina - 2005." It includes actual crime rates
statewide and by selected cities from 2004 - 2005. Murders, rapes and aggravated
assaults increased in Durham in 2005. Durham had more murders then Fayetteville,
Greensboro, Raleigh and Winston-Salem in 2005.

Reviewing the crime rates per 100,000 persons by county is even more sobering.
Durham has a violent crime rate of 688 crimes committed per 100,000 persons.
Only five counties out of the 100 counties in North Carolina have higher crime
rates then Durham County. In other words, ninety-five percent of all North
Carolina counties have lower violent crime rates then Durham County. These are
facts, not perceptions, misperceptions or any other kind of misinformation.

However, the news on Durham crime is not all bad. The same publication reported
that property crime, robbery, burglary, larceny, motor vehicle thefts and arson
decreased in 2005. Overall, the total number of reported crime offenses in
Durham decreased by 2 percent.

Does Durham have a high crime rate? Yes, but with some caveats. True, Durham's
crime rate has some very sobering and a few encouraging statistics.

The increase in murders, rapes and aggravated assaults is alarming and ranked
sixth out of all North Carolina counties for violent crimes is very disturbing.
But other crimes are on the decrease in Durham. It is a complex and multifaceted
problem, especially when you get below the generalities and into the specifics.

DCVB does a disservice to Durham's citizens by attempting to put a false,
unenlightening and frankly, unrepresentative answer to the public's perception
of Durham's high crime rate.

Let's continue to hold our local media and town representatives accountable for
the way they spin Durham to the national media. These same proponents, who boast
how Durham citizens are proud to air their differences openly in robust and
spirited debates, need to practice what they preach -- especially when it comes
to presenting Durham's blemishes factually to the world.

Violent crime tumbles; steepest drop since '73

The violent-crime rate declined by 10.4 percent last year, the largest one-year
drop in the 26-year history of the government's largest crime survey, the
Justice Department reported yesterday. The survey, which confirms trends
identified in the FBI's annual crime reports, estimated that there were 28.8
million violent and property crimes in 1999, the lowest figure since the survey
was begun in 1973.

JonBenet Ramsey's parents to discuss slaying

For the first time in more than two years, John and Patsy Ramsey are scheduled
to meet today with investigators to discuss the unsolved 1996 slaying of their
6-year-old daughter, JonBenet. The Ramseys are scheduled to answer questions in
separate sessions in Atlanta with a seven-member investigative team led by
Boulder, Colo., Police Chief Mark Beckner.

More flights resume as United nears labor pact

United Airlines canceled fewer flights yesterday after reaching a tentative
labor pact with its pilots, but said it could be some time before schedules were
back to normal. United and the Air Line Pilots Association, which represents
10,000 of the carrier's pilots, reached a tentative pact late Saturday after
more than a year and a half of protracted talks. Flight cancellations, which
averaged 190 per day in August, dropped to 47 by midday yesterday, United said.

Strike shuts a major Navy shipyard in Maine

A union representing 4,800 workers at shipmaker Bath Iron Works in Portland,
Maine, voted yesterday to strike, shutting down production at one of the biggest
shipbuilders for the U.S. Navy. The shipyard is one of Maine's largest private
employers with 7,600 employees, producing Navy destroyers.

Okla. woman missing after Hawaii plane crash

A search on Saturday failed to locate a woman missing from the crash of a small
sightseeing plane off the coast of Hawaii Island. The eight people who survived
Friday's crash were released from Hilo Medical Center over the weekend. The
missing woman was identified as Laveta Rose Reynolds, 61, of North Collinsville,
Okla. Her husband, James Reynolds, 64, was among the survivors.

Researchers link diabetes to genetic variation

Researchers from Children's Hospital in Boston have shown that a common genetic
variation increases the risk of contracting type-2 diabetes. Though the findings
do not offer immediate hope of a cure, scientists said linking the variation to
diabetes could offer new avenues of research. The study was published in the
September issue of Nature Genetics. Type-2 diabetes usually develops in
adolescence or adulthood and is often related to obesity. It afflicts an
estimated nine million Americans.

Serbs vent rage on U.N., NATO after child dies

A car driven by an ethnic Albanian struck a group of Serbian children playing in
a field in Kosovo yesterday, killing one and injuring four. Serbs quickly
charged that the killing near Skulanovo was deliberate and attacked U.N. cars
and peacekeepers' vehicles. Both the United Nations and the peacekeepers ordered
their forces to withdraw from the area. A NATO spokesman, Maj. Scott Slaten,
said peacekeepers had arrested the driver of the vehicle.

At least 17 slain in Colombia attacks

Gunmen in Colombia killed at least 17 people in two separate massacres
yesterday, one of which officials attributed to a right-wing militia. The
killings come three days before President Clinton is to visit Colombia to
discuss U.S. anti-narcotics aid to the drug-producing nation. In one attack,
gunmen executed 10 residents in Cienaga, police said. In the second attack,
police blamed right-wing militiamen for the slaying of seven people outside
Buenaventura.

Japanese police raid Mitsubishi headquarters

Japanese police searched the headquarters of Mitsubishi Motors Corp. as well as
two factories and the homes of two officials yesterday in connection with the

Dems find crime bill doesn't pay / GOP making gains with a wary public

BYLINE: William M. Welch

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 8A

LENGTH: 421 words


The crime bill Congress passed last month isn't proving to be the political
success story Democrats needed this fall.

The latest USA TODAY/CNN/Gallup Poll shows that while voters like the bill,
public confidence on crime is shifting back to Republicans - the party that used
the issue successfully for decades and largely opposed Clinton's bill.

By 43% to 39%, respondents say the Republican Party would do a better job
dealing with crime. And by 54%-41% they disapprove of Clinton's handling of the
issue.

Both are changes from last spring, when Democrats seized the issue by promising
more police on the streets and a ban on assault weapons.

"A couple of months ago it looked like this crime bill was going to be a big
deal; the president was going to get a bump out of it," says political analyst
Stuart Rothenberg. "I think the post-mortem is much more cautious. The impact is
much more limited."

With the apparent collapse of health-care reform, many Democrats have looked to
the crime bill - which Clinton signs on Tuesday - as elixir for a grim fall
campaign prognosis. The public does back the bill by a 50%-33% margin.

But many Republican congressional candidates say opposition benefits them. In
races around the country, GOP candidates are using the issue like a club, saying
Democrats packed the bill with pork-barrel waste.

"People are so angry because they have seen through the crime bill debate how
corrupt the process was," says Republican National Chairman Haley Barbour.
"They're furious about all the pork."

Democratic National Chairman David Wilhelm says Democrats will be rewarded if
they tout the get-tough specifics.

"Democrats have Republicans on the run on this issue," he says. "This is a bill
people wanted to have passed."

The poll has some encouragement for Democrats; 36% say they are less likely to
support a lawmaker who opposed the bill, 22% are more likely.

"Republicans may think they have a club, but what they've really got is a
double-edged sword," says Democratic pollster Geoff Garin.

Half support new crime bill Support for the recently passed crime bill,
according to a new USA TODAY/CNN/Gallup Poll:
Favor        50%
Oppose       33%
No opinion   17%

Effect of opposing passage If your member of Cogress had tried to prevent the
crime bill from passing, would it make you more or less likely to vote for that
person:

Question: Does the death penalty deter crime?

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 8A

LENGTH: 249 words


Beverly Bailey, 46
Associate manager
Indian Harbor Bch., Fla.

I think it would deter crime if they wouldn't keep appealing these things. If
they went to the chair right away, it would scare these criminals. As long as
they keep appealing, they know they aren't going to die, and they don't worry
about it.

Jeffrey Liggett, 21
Student
Newark, Del.

No, I don't think the death penalty deters crime. I don't think the murder rate
has gone down even with the death penalty instituted. In the heat of the moment
people don't think about the repercussions, they just kill if they feel like it.

Rodney Swope, 29
Purchasing manager
Cincinnati, Ohio

Offenders subject to capital punishment generally place little value on human
life, as evidenced by the crimes they commit. Fear of losing their own
under-appreciated life is no deterrent. Although it might seem expedient for
society, a life for a crime is still two crimes.

Keisha Howard, 19
Student
Haxtun, Colo.

I don't think so. When they get to the point where they kill someone, like the
mass murderers, they're crazy anyway. If you tell someone we're going to execute
you, they don't really care at that point.

Larry Chapman, 46
Wellness consultant
Seattle, Wash.

The death sentence acts as a relatively minor deterrent. We are best served by a
more broad-based approach to deal with the roots of criminal behavior. Family
and moral and ethical values need to be more significantly addressed in our
culture.

August 2-8;
Doubt on Crime Statistics

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD

SECTION: Section 4; Page 2; Column 4; Week in Review Desk

LENGTH: 156 words


Crime has been dropping dramatically for the past six years, to the lowest level
since the 1960's, when the late-20th-century crime wave exploded in the United
States. But now charges are being raised that police commanders in several
cities have falsified their crime statistics to keep up with the nationwide
decline, and this is raising concern that some crime data may be skewed.

In the past few months, senior police officials have been demoted or forced to
resign because some crime statistics were manipulated in New York, Philadelphia,
Atlanta and Boca Raton, Fla. Typically, felonies like burglary were downgraded
to less serious crimes like trespassing or vandalism.

Despite these incidents, criminologists say the general downward trend in crime
is undoubtedly true, since it has shown up not only in police reports but also
in a Justice Department survey of victims of crimes nationwide.

Russian Aide Says Gangsters Try to Steal Nuclear Material

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON,   Special to The New York Times

SECTION: Section A;  Page 5;  Column 1;  Foreign Desk

LENGTH: 641 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 25


A senior Russian law enforcement official said today that organized crime in
Russia was trying to infiltrate military installations to steal nuclear material
and sell it on the black market.

"These crime groups in recent years are demonstrating more and more interest
toward the defense facilities of the former Soviet Union," Mikhail Yegorov, head
of the organized crime control department of the Russian Ministry of Internal
Affairs, said in an appearance before a Congressional committee.

Mr. Yegorov insisted that Russia's military bases were well guarded, but he
acknowledged that 47 criminal investigations had been opened into attempts to
steal radioactive materials.

But Louis J. Freeh, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation,
provided a less reassuring picture.

Mr. Freeh told the Senate Government Affairs Committee that while the F.B.I. did
not have any evidence to confirm reports that Russian criminals have stolen
nuclear warheads or bomb-grade materials, Interpol, the international police
agency, had reported the disappearance of two kilograms (4.4 pounds) of highly
enriched uranium from an institution near St. Petersberg.

Mr. Freeh indicated that the report was being taken seriously and was under
investigation. Six to 10 kilograms of highly enriched uranium are needed to make
a small nuclear bomb.

More broadly, American officials are worried that the growth of organized crime
in Russia and the fact that the Russian mafia has targeted military
installations have greatly increased the risk of nuclear theft.

"We are gravely concerned Russian organized crime members may have already
attained or will attain the capacity to steal nuclear weapons," Mr. Freeh said.

The Russian mafia's interest in nuclear materials is just one result of a crime
wave that has occurred in Russia since the collapse of the former Soviet Union.
Mr. Yegorov told the Senate panel that crime was endangering economic reforms in
Russia and added that Russian criminals were beginning to make inroads in Europe
and the United States.

"At the present time, organized crime is a real threat to the stability of the
country's economic and social life," Mr. Yegorov said. "Up to 50 percent, in
some cases, of the profits that these criminal organizations get they use to
bribe official persons."

Russians officials say that organized crime existed under Soviet rule, mostly in
black markets, but that it has flourished in recent years with the growth of a
private economy.

Mr. Yegorov said that there were nearly 5,700 criminal groups in Russia with
about 100,000 members, and that 101 Russian criminal organizations operate
abroad, in 29 countries.

He said 183 Russian police officers were killed and over 800 wounded fighting in
gun battles with organized crime last year.

Mr. Yegorov said that the Russian criminal organizations were involved in drug
dealing, money laundering and other activities in San Francisco, Los Angeles,
Miami, Chicago and New York.

And Mr. Freeh said Russian organized crime was linked to a $1 billion health
care fraud case in Los Angeles. To work with Russia, the F.B.I. is setting up an
office in Moscow.

He added that there were 47 Russian groups in Germany involved in extortion,
fraud and economic crimes, and that more than 60 such groups operated in Italy.

Trying to defend Russian handling of the nuclear issue, Mr. Yegorov insisted
that military installations had good security. He also detailed some of the
attempted 47 thefts, saying the vast majority of them involved attempts to steal
very small quantities of nuclear material or low-enriched uranium that were
thwarted by the Russian authorities.

But he said nine of the cases involved allegations of attempted thefts of highly
enriched uranium. He said one of those nine cases was linked to organized crime.

New Indictment Cites Talk of Killing Gravano Family

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN

SECTION: Section B; Page 3; Column 1; Metropolitan Desk

LENGTH: 992 words


As Salvatore Gravano was preparing to become the chief prosecution witness
against John Gotti, his former boss in the Gambino crime family, three
organized-crime figures were talking about killing Mr. Gravano's wife and two
sons, according to Federal law-enforcement officials.

Their conversation is mentioned in a Federal racketeering indictment that was
unsealed yesterday in Newark with the arrest of 11 men in New York, New Jersey
and Massachusetts. One of those arrested was James Martorano, 50 years old, of
Quincy, Mass., who was identified by Federal officials as a captain in the New
England-based Patriarca crime family and the organization's liaison with the New
York-based Genovese crime family.

The indictment says Mr. Martorano had a number of conversations over the last
year with members of the Genovese crime organization in Boston; in Stamford,
Conn., and on Staten Island to discuss gambling, extortion and murder.

On Jan. 22, according to the indictment, Mr. Martorano met in Boston with John
Marrone, 56, of Edison, N.J., and Ralph Marino, 56, of Brentwood, L.I., who were
identified by the grand jury that handed up the indictment as members of the
Genovese family, and discussed killing Mr. Gravano's family because of his role
as a Government witness.

'Particularly Sensitive'

Michael Chertoff, the United States Attorney for New Jersey, declined to go
beyond the brief mention of that conversation in the indictment, saying the
incident was "particularly sensitive" because of Mr. Gravano's recent testimony
in Mr. Gotti's racketeering trial in Federal District Court in Brooklyn. Mr.
Chertoff declined to say whether he thought the conversation was evidence of a
serious plan to attack the Gravano family or simply an expression of anger. He
would not discuss whether Mrs. Gravano had been warned of the threat.

If Mr. Gravano's family was attacked, it would be a departure from the
traditional rules of the Mafia, law-enforcement officials said. But such attacks
seem to be something that is no longer unthinkable. Last week two masked gunmen
shot and wounded Patricia Capozzalo as she arrived at her Brooklyn home after
dropping one of her three children at school.

The police have said there is no indication that Ms. Capozzalo has any
involvement in organized crime. Her only connection, the police said, is that
her brother, Peter Chiodo, is a former crime family member who has turned police
informer and joined the witness protection program.

Mr. Gravano has testified that he was an underboss of the Gambino crime family
and that Mr. Gotti became the boss of the family by arranging the murder of his
predecessor, Paul Castellano.

A Connecticut Operation

In the Gotti trial in Brooklyn, several F.B.I. agents testified yesterday about
the surveillance of Mr. Gotti and others as the prosecution sought to link him
to a Connecticut gambling operation and a plot to murder a reputed New Jersey
mobster.

The prosecution contends that Mr. Gotti agreed to help the DeCavalcante group
kill one of its members, Gaetano Vastola, because they feared he would turn
informer after receiving a long prison sentence. The prosecution also is seeking
to prove that a Gotti associate conducted gambling for him in Connecticut.

The gambling operation and the murder plot are part of the racketeering charges
against Mr. Gotti.

Delay Requested

Gary L. Penrith, the special agent in charge of the Newark office of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation, said prosecutors in New York, concerned about the
possible impact on the Gotti trial of the reference to Mr. Gravano in the New
Jersey indictment, asked if its unsealing could be delayed. He said the decision
was made to release it as planned because of the violent nature of the targets
of the investigation and the fear that any delay could allow time for further
violence.

In announcing the indictment, Mr. Chertoff said that despite recent successful
prosecutions, "the Genovese family is as violent and aggressive as it has ever
been; its potential for viciousness is equal to anything we've seen."

In addition to Mr. Martorano, Mr. Marrone and Mr. Marino, those named in the
indictment were Salvatore Lombardi, 52, of Staten Island, who was identifed as
the "ranking captain" of the Genovese family; Joseph Maniscalco, 52, of Staten
Island, identified as another captain; Peter Tomasina, 44, and Alexander Cuomo,
52, both of Brooklyn; Leonard Macaluso, 56, and Andrew Nedza, 45, both of
Orange, N.J.; Michael Paris, 44, of West Orange, N.J., and Armand Cucciniello,
40, of East Hanover, N.J.

All except Mr. Lombardi were arrested by F.B.I. agents at or near their homes
and places of business yesterday morning. Mr. Lombardi is in custody at Rikers
Island awaiting trial on charges of conspiracy in connection with a heroin
distribution case, according to the F.B.I.

The defendants were brought before Federal magistrates in Newark, Boston and
Brooklyn to face the charges. Mr. Chertoff said he would move to have the
defendants detained until trial. Magistrate Ronald J. Hedges ordered that the
defendants brought before him in Newark be held until Friday, when he will hear
the Government's detention motion.

Among the illegal acts cited in the indictment, some dating to 1987, are
conspiracy to commit kidnapping, murder, arson, extortion, bribery of public
officials, loan sharking and illegal sports betting.

Mr. Chertoff said the Genovese family captains indicted yesterday were sent to
New Jersey from New York to replace the family's third-ranking member, Louis
Anthony Manna of Jersey City, and three captains who have been imprisoned on
racketeering charges.

"We will continue to attack them as they reach in from New York to fill
vacancies," Mr. Chertoff, the United States Attorney, said. "That will convince
up-and-coming members to turn down those jobs, and that will make it easier to
pick off the remainder."

Office of Justice Programs Awards More Than $5.6 Million to Enable Information,
Technology Sharing to Reduce Crime

LENGTH: 653  words

DATELINE: New York



 Washington: Office of Public Affairs Department of Justice has issued the
following news release:



  The Office of Justice Programs' Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) today
announced funding of more than $5.6 million through two separate programs.  One
is a new initiative designed to help communities reduce and prosecute gun crime;
the other is an annual grant that enables jurisdictions to leverage technology
and information sharing to enhance criminal justice operations.





 Nearly $3 million was awarded to three cities--Metropolitan Police Dept. of the
District of Columbia ($999,129), Wisconsin's Milwaukee Police Dept. ($1
million), and the City of Los Angeles ($1 million)--via BJA's National Crime Gun
Intelligence Center Initiative, a newly developed initiative in 2016.  The
program, which is supported and administered in partnership between BJA and the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), supports the
implementation of three crime gun intelligence centers in the above listed
cities.  These centers employ multidisciplinary teams to identify perpetrators
and connect criminal activity and sources of gun crime for immediate disruption,
investigation and prosecution.  Each site will also work closely with a research
partner to help guide implementation and evaluate program outcomes.



 Another $2.6 million was awarded to six cities and the Washington, D.C.-based
Police Foundation ($499,826) to enhance information sharing capacities through
the use of innovative technological solutions to reduce crime.  Funded through
BJA's annual competitive grant Technology Innovation for Public Safety Program,
the resources provided through this grant are intended to help selectees address
a precipitous or extraordinary increase in crime in individual jurisdictions.
To combat this, awardees are enabled to share information across crime-fighting
agencies.  This collaboration can help address specific local crime problems,
which often require multidisciplinary responses involving public safety
agencies, personnel and shared investment in technology.



 "The Office of Justice Programs is committed to giving our state and local
partners the tools they need to drive down crime and maintain public safety for
the long run," said Assistant Attorney General Karol V. Mason of the Office of
Justice Programs.  "These new resources will expand community capability to
investigate and prosecute gun offenses and support data sharing and other
technological solutions to serious violence challenges."



 The six cities and police departments awarded under the Technology Innovation
for Public Safety Program include: the New Castle County Division of Police,
Del. ($306,700); the City of Hartford, Connecticut ($245,681); the City of
Cincinnati, Ohio ($370,673); the Los Angeles Police Department ($395,717); the
City of Memphis, Tennessee ($401,193); and the St. Louis, Missouri, County
Government ($400,636).

Initiative, visit http://go.usa.gov/xKefx. For additional information about the

 The Office of Justice Programs (OJP), headed by Assistant Attorney General
Mason, provides federal leadership in developing the nation's capacity to
prevent and control crime, administer justice, and assist victims.  OJP has six
bureaus and offices: the Bureau of Justice Assistance; the Bureau of Justice
Statistics; the National Institute of Justice; the Office of Juvenile Justice
and Delinquency Prevention; the Office for Victims of Crime, and the Office of
Sex Offender Sentencing, Monitoring, Apprehending, Registering, and Tracking

Top 25 most violent Illinois cities in Law Street Media's 2016 rankings

BYLINE: Kevin Hoffman, Reboot Illinois

SECTION: NATIONAL POLITICAL NEWS

LENGTH: 1010 words


Oct. 19--With a violent crime rate of 370 per 100,000 people in 2014, Illinois
is the No. 21 most dangerous state in the U.S., according to a new report.

Law Street Media published its third annual rankings of America's "Safest & Most
Dangerous States" for 2016 using the latest available violent crime data from
the FBI. The report ranks cities with populations of at least 25,000 that have
the highest and lowest violent crime rates. Those rates are based on crimes of
murder, forcible rape, aggravated assault and robbery, under the national
Uniform Crime Report guidelines.

While East St. Louis and Chicago were absent from Law Street's 2015 rankings
because of incomplete and underreported data, both cities were included in this
year's analysis.

HIGH-TECH CRIME IS MURDER ON INSURERS' BOTTOM LINES THIEVES SEE ITEMS AS MORE
PRECIOUS THAN GOLD

BYLINE: MICHAEL S. LELYVELD; Journal of Commerce Staff

SECTION: INSURANCE, Pg. 9A

LENGTH: 737 words

DATELINE: BURLINGTON, Mass.


A wave of high-tech thefts by armed thugs, spies, crooked workers and even the
Russian Mafia is making life dangerous for U.S. manufacturers and costly for
insurers, according to law enforcement officials.

The crime spree has been spurred by the value of high-tech items such as
computers, chips, software and proprietary data, which pound for pound may be
more precious than gold, officials said last week at a seminar sponsored by the
New England Council of the American Electronics Association and the Chubb Group
f Insurance Cos.

The seriousness of the problem struck home when one member of the audience
reported that her company had been victimized just one week before. Nancy
Jenkins, assistant treasurer of Burlington-based Dynatech Corp., said that
gunmen ambushed the last person to leave the company's plant in San Jose,
Calif., and stole an undetermined amount of chips and other high-priced goods.

"When they come in with guns drawn, there's not a whole lot you can do," said
Ms. Jenkins.

The FBI, police and insurers are telling companies that they need to do more to
tighten security before such incidents take place.

The crime wave has already swamped the West Coast where Sgt. Jim McMahon, a San
Jose police detective and chairman of the U.S. High-Tech Crimes Task Force,
estimates that theft costs Silicon Valley companies $ 1 million a week.

Officials say the trend is migrating east and turning into a national problem as
high-tech theft becomes the new crime of choice for crooks ranging from two-bit
burglars to foreign intelligence agents.

While it is hard to put a price tag on the problem because many companies don't
like to talk about it, Bill Falsone, a Chubb vice president, said his company
paid $ 10 million in claims for electronic thefts last year, up from from $ 4
million in 1993.

While break-ins are on the rise, employee theft is still seen as most common.
Insiders, including consultants, also account for 70 percent of the theft of
proprietary information such as customer lists and pricing data, according to a
study co-authored by Richard J. Heffernan, a Connecticut-based security
specialist and FBI consultant.

Concerns about employee theft are also changing some corporate cultures. Kim
Grey, operations director for Data Translation Inc. in Marlboro, Mass., said her
company has gone from a business "without walls" to a strictly- controlled
environment since October after $ 140,000 worth of components were discovered
missing.

"It's very bad, but it had to be done," Ms. Grey said, noting a new ''lack of
trust" among workers. "They know that they're looking eye to eye with someone
who stole parts from the company."

Specialists recommend a series of steps for the industry including security
audits, better employee screening, use of color-coded identification badges,
bullet-proof double doors and even armored cars for deliveries.

The need for secure communications has also become apparent. In one case, an
intercepted fax from a New Jersey company to its Moscow subsidiary allowed the
Russian Mafia to empty a 45-foot container in transit and reseal it before it
arrived, Mr. Heffernan said. Thieves have also taken to cutting phone lines for
entire industrial parks, disabling alarms for the whole area, said Mr. McMahon.

James Blackburn, FBI special agent, said the agency is working to help industry
in fighting off foreign efforts to target U.S. technology.

"Even some friendly nations are keenly interested in acquiring through any
channels U.S. government secrets, defense information, critical technology and
proprietary information of U.S. corporations," said Mr. Blackburn.

Mr. Blackburn noted a broadcast interview with a former head of French
intelligence who openly acknowledged that agents have sought to gain American
technology by covert means.

According to Mr. Heffernan's study, the incidence of foreign involvement in
attempts to acquire U.S. technology illegally has risen nearly fourfold since
1985. The survey of 246 companies showed that compromised information has cost
some $ 1.8 billion in U.S. business losses.

Laptop computers have become a favorite target, not only because of their value
as hardware but because of the information they contain. The loss of company
data as a result of careless storage of laptops by U.S. executives on trips
abroad has become increasingly common, officials said.

RANDOM KILLINGS ON RISE IN U.S.; MOST VICTIMS ARE NOW SLAIN BY STRANGERS, FBI
REPORTS

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 7A

LENGTH: 488 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON


The FBI has reported a dramatic shift in national murder patterns during the
1990s, with a sharp increase in random killings by strangers.

"Every American now has a realistic chance of murder victimization in view of
the random nature the crime has assumed," the FBI said in its annual report on
crime in the United States, scheduled for release Sunday.

While reporting that all serious crimes except arson continued dropping in 1994,
the FBI said most of the nation's homicide victims are killed by strangers.

The FBI figures showed St. Louis had the nation's fourth-highest murder rate in
1993: 69 murders for each 100,000 residents. Gary, Ind., had the highest rate,
89.1, followed by New Orleans and Washington.

Just below St. Louis were Detroit, Richmond, Va.; Atlanta, Baltimore, San
Bernardino, Calif., and Birmingham, Ala.

In the past, most homicides took place during what it called "clearly defined
circumstances such as crimes of passion and arguments among family members or
acquaintances," the report said.

The report added: "The advent of this trend has generated a profound fear of
murder victimization in that the circumstances surrounding homicides are
perceived to be more irrational."

The FBI said the public's concern about vicious and senseless murders reflects
involvement by younger victims and killers, with more juvenile gang homicides in
the past decade. It said the rise in gangs have been linked to illegal drug
trade, the disintegration of the family and a proliferation of weapons on the
streets.

The FBI said the number of serious crimes nationwide fell 3 percent in the first
six months of 1994, continuing a decline that began in 1992. The crime rate fell
5 percent last year and 2 percent in 1992.

The decreases occurred after an eight-year upswing fueled by a wave of
inner-city murders and drug-related incidents involving assault weapons.

"Any decline in reported crime is welcome, but the level of crime is still
unacceptably high and it must be substantially reduced," FBI Director Louis
Freeh said.

Violent crimes reported to police nationwide dropped 4 percent in the first half
of 1994 from the same year-ago period. The rate for murders fell 2 percent,
rapes decreased 6 percent, robberies went down 4 percent, and aggravated assault
dropped 3 percent.

Of the so-called property crimes, burglaries dropped 6 percent while larcenies
and car thefts each declined 2 percent. Only the arson rate showed no change.

Regionally, the crime rate fell 7 percent in the Northeast, followed by 3
percent in the South, 2 percent in the West and 1 percent in the Midwest.

The largest decline of 6 percent took place in big cities; suburban and rural
areas showed no change in their crime rates.

St. Louis Police Chief Clarence Harmon noted that the rate of murder, rape and
robbery was lower in the first 10 months of this year than in the same period of
1993.

Insurance Industry Moves to Fight Fraud;
Agency Formed to Aid Enforcement Officials

Albert B. Crenshaw, Washington Post Staff Writer

SECTION: FINANCIAL; PAGE D9

LENGTH: 705 words


Beset by steadily rising fraud losses, the nation's automobile and property
insurers yesterday announced the formation of a new agency designed to help
law-enforcement officials track down and prosecute insurance cheats.

The National Insurance Crime Bureau, formed by a combination of the National
Automobile Theft Bureau and Insurance Crime Prevention Institute, will have a
budget of $ 30 million and a huge computerized database that will be linked
directly to the FBI's computer system.

In addition, the NICB will employ a small force of investigators and will help
train others employed by individual companies. Currently, officials estimate,
companies spend about $ 100 million a year combating fraud.

A major problem, according to NICB President Arnold Schlossberg Jr., is that
despite the vast sums involved and despite the fact that lawyers, doctors and
other professionals are sometimes involved, overworked local law enforcement
agencies place a low priority on stopping insurance fraud.

With all the violence and drug crimes, "the truth is, they don't have the money
or the resources even to go out and investigate this stuff," Schlossberg said.
"Therefore, we've hired a bunch of folks ... to do the investigation, put it in
a box with a yellow bow on it and try to get the police and the prosecutors to
show an interest in it."

Even then, however, local authorities are sometimes reluctant to tie up the
courts, Schlossberg added. "They say, 'gee, that's between the insurance
industry and an individual.' "

Some 700 property-casualty insurance companies are supporting the new agency.

Insurance fraud has been growing explosively, according to industry figures.

In big cities like New York, Washington and Los Angeles, insurers estimate that
fully 10 percent of all auto insurance claims are either highly inflated or
completely fraudulent. Nationally, an industry group estimates that 15 percent
of all vehicle theft reports are fake.

In California and some other states, 10 percent of all property-casualty claims
are believed to be false or padded, the industry said.

In all, such fake or inflated claims cost the insurers more than $ 17 billion
last year, adding on average more than $ 100 to the auto and homeowner insurance
premiums of residents in many jurisdictions, according to industry figures.

Schlossberg said his best guess is that about half the fraud is committed by
amateurs either picking up extra money on a legitimate claim or doing a small
number of jobs with the help of friends and relatives. The rest are committed by
professional rings that include crooked doctors, lawyers, repair shops and
others.

Schlossberg said there is a case currently under investigation that seems to
involve 1,000 lawyers and 166 doctors. And he noted that professionals are hard
to catch, particularly lawyers who insulate themselves with go-betweens and
middlemen.

Patterns of behavior are a key to breaking these rings, Schlossberg said, noting
that it generally takes five claims to put together one fraud case.

But successes do occur, he said.

Accompanying industry officials for yesterday's announcement was Louis Orlando,
35, whose brief career as an insurance fraud artist came to an end last year
when he was turned in by associates who were nabbed in a sting and cooperated
with authorities.

Orlando described helping out a friend who had bought a boat but found he
couldn't afford the payments. "I said, 'Well, we could run over it,' " Orlando
recalled yesterday. So the two put the boat on a trailer and staged a traffic
accident in which the boat was demolished. The friend collected $ 5,000 in
insurance money and his problem was solved.

Orlando's problem, however, was just beginning. Figuring he was onto a way to
make money, the Myrtle Beach, S.C., man helped stage some five other car
accidents, destroying thousands of dollars' worth of vehicles to help the owners
collect on their insurance.

As a result of the sting, he now faces 15 months in prison plus three years'
probation and a stretch of community service.

But Orlando counted himself lucky: Indicted on three counts, he could have been
given as much as 15 years in prison. "I got a fair deal," he said.

Here are some tidbits about Florida's 20 largest cities in 1990:
 Tampa had the third-highest rate of vehicle thefts 22 per 1,000 residents. The
rate was 11 in St. Petersburg, 5 in Clearwater and 2 in Largo.

 Miami had the highest murder rate, followed by Jacksonville and West Palm
Beach. Tampa was tied for fourth with Fort Lauderdale.

 The burglary rate was highest in West Palm Beach. Fort Lauderdale was second
and Tampa third.

 Tampa's rate of violent crimes 31 for every 1,000 residents was more than
double the state average. That made Tampa the second-most dangerous city. Miami
was first and West Palm Beach third.

 Miami's robbery rate was the highest, five times above the state average. West
Palm Beach was second and Tampa third.

DATELINE: OAKLAND, Calif.; NEW YORK; WASHINGTON; MADISON, Wis.



OAKLAND, Calif. - Officials have declared a water shortage emergency in    the
communities east of San Francisco and are warning they may ration    water to
1.1-million customers for the first time in a decade. If a    voluntary
conservation plan fails, the agency may impose water    restrictions of up to 25
percent for homes and businesses in Alameda    and Contra Costa counties from
May through September. The proposed    measures, triggered by a drought, would
be the most severe steps taken    by the district since the 1977 drought.



 Serious crimes rise in New York

 NEW YORK - The number of serious crimes in New York City rose in 1987,    with
murders up 5.7 percent and aggravated assaults up 12.1 percent,    according to
police figures released Tuesday. The index of all serious    crimes increased
3.4 percent in 1987, after a 5.6 percent rise in 1986.

 Serious crime in New York City had fallen steadily between 1981 and    1986,
when the chaotic and volatile crack trade began to pervade many    neighborhoods
in the city. In 1986, murders showed a dramatic 14    percent increase that
reflected the spread of crack, a form of cocaine.



 North Carolina Democrat rebuked

 WASHINGTON - The House ethics committee Wednesday sharply rebuked Rep.
Charles Rose, D-N.C., after concluding he improperly borrowed funds    from his
campaign and then failed to publicly report the transactions.

 The panel, formally the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct,    wrote
Rose that his behavior was "deserving of reproach." But the    committee
concluded there should be no punishment by the full House    because the
eight-term lawmaker has tried to rectify his mistakes.



 Senate approves Navy secretary

 WASHINGTON - The Senate gave voice vote approval Wednesday to the    nomination
of William Ball III to be Navy secretary, replacing James H.    Webb. Ball, a
former Reagan administration lobbyist on Capitol Hill,    was appointed by
President Reagan after Webb resigned in a budget    dispute with Defense
Secretary Frank C. Carlucci.



 Plan to burn puppy stirs rage

 MADISON, Wis. - A man's plan to burn a puppy in public to dramatize
brutality drew hostile protest calls Wednesday. More than 200 calls    were
recorded by a radio station, and the Dane County Humane Society    said it
received more than 50 calls. David Read, a 26-year-old    philosophy student,
welcomed the controversy. He said he wanted to make    people think about
brutality, and he insisted he still plans to burn    the dog on Monday.

SAFETY AND NUMBERS: A special report.;
Crime in Region Is Dropping, But Some Pockets Defy Trend

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GLABERSON

SECTION: Section A; Page 1; Column 1; Metropolitan Desk

LENGTH: 2395 words


Serious crime in the ring of cities and suburbs around New York City has fallen
to its lowest level since at least 1980, an analysis of data for the last 16
years shows. But it has not dropped nearly as far as it has in New York City,
and it appears to be rising again in a few of the region's most troubled urban
areas and the fastest growing suburbs.

The overall decline in crime rates masks increases in the rates of violent crime
in the suburban areas of nine counties, including the densely settled Bergen
County in New Jersey, a rapidly developing crescent of central New Jersey and
high-growth areas of New York State. About three million people live in areas
where 1995 crime rates are higher than their 1990 rates. Some 12 million others
in the region, plus 7 million in New York City, live in suburbs or cities where
crime rates are dropping.

Declines have been recorded from cities like Yonkers and Trenton to suburban
areas like Suffolk County on Long Island and rural areas like Litchfield County,
Conn. Over all, in the region that rings New York City, the numbers of reported
serious crimes like murder, rape and robbery declined twice as fast as in the
nation since a peak in 1990.

The decline has occurred, experts say, for the same reasons often credited in
New York and the nation. They include demographic shifts that have left many
towns with fewer of the young people who typically commit the most crimes, and
with more police officers.

"What we are experiencing, we are experiencing as a region," said John S.
Pritchard 3d, the Police Commissioner in Mount Vernon, N.Y., next to the Bronx.
"The trends are regional trends."

In a pattern that is typical for urban areas outside New York, reported violent
crime fell 21 percent from 1990 through 1996 in Mount Vernon, while the decline
in New York City was 44 percent.

Illustrating the trend, while violent crime was falling in New York City to a
rate of 1,324 incidents per 100,000 people in 1996, from 2,384 in 1990, there
were declines throughout the region, although often not as fast. In Trenton, for
example, during the same six years, the violent crime rate fell to 1,521 from
1,986, while in New Haven, it fell to 2,188 from 3,059.

An analysis of crime records by The New York Times found these developments:

*There are now seven cities in the region that are more violent than New York,
compared with only one -- Newark -- that was more violent 16 years ago. And in
two of them -- Bridgeport, Conn., and New Haven -- violent crime increased in
1996.

*If 12 urban areas near New York were a city of 1.6 million, it would have a
higher rate of violent crime than New York, which was not the case in 1994.
Today, those areas report 24 percent more violent crime than New York City and
73 percent more thefts and burglaries.

*Putnam County in New York, Hunterdon and Warren Counties in New Jersey and
Litchfield County, Conn., are the least violent in the region, and all are safer
since 1980.

*Putnam and Suffolk are the only counties in the region where violent crime
dropped more sharply than in New York City from 1990 to 1995. Putnam's drop was
58 percent and Suffolk's was 54 percent, compared with 38.4 percent in New York
City.

*Crime rates have fallen much faster around New York City than in the nation and
are now much lower than the national average. And even counties with rising
crime have fairly low crime rates. Despite the increases, most of those counties
are still safer than the whole nation.


The Statistics
Over All, Outpacing The Nation's Drop

The computer analysis shows that in the New York-Connecticut-New Jersey
metropolitan area, excluding New York City, the reported violent crimes of
murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault fell 15 percent from 1990 through
1995, the last year for which data is available for every community in the
region.

During the same period, violent crime fell 34 percent in New York City. But in
the nation as a whole, violent crime fell just 6.5 percent from 1990 through
1995. By 1995, the area around New York had a violent crime rate 35 percent
lower than the nation as a whole.

The property crimes of burglary, larceny and auto theft fell even more sharply
in the region around New York City, by 21 percent.

As in New York City, murder is less a part of life in the metropolitan region
than it used to be. In 1990, there were 610 murders reported in the 26-county
region surrounding New York City, which has 12.6 million residents. In 1995,
that number had fallen to 510, a decline of 16 percent. During the same period
in New York City, with its 7.3 million residents, murder fell 48 percent, to
1,177 from 2,245.

The Times's analysis included computer comparisons of crime data in the
26-county area that the Regional Plan Association identifies as the greater New
York area. The data included statistics since 1980 from every county in the
region on the seven serious crimes that go into the F.B.I. crime index: murder,
rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny and auto theft. The
analysis also included comparisons with crime rates in New York City and the
nation, and data from 1996 for some cities in the region.

As in New York City, the falling crime rate has led to a debate about whether it
is a result of new policing strategies or, rather, demographic trends that are
likely to change.

"We are obviously doing something right because crime is falling," said John
Kaye, the Monmouth County Prosecutor in New Jersey. "But the number of juveniles
who are coming along tell us this is a momentary lull in the crime rate."

The computer analysis of preliminary statistics for 1996 shows crime continuing
to decline in many communities. But in three cities where the numbers of serious
crimes had been declining -- New Haven, Waterbury and Bridgeport -- 1996 numbers
show crime beginning to increase again, by 17 percent in New Haven, for example.

Some police officials said they were not sure whether those statistics reflected
local circumstances or a hint that crime rates may begin to climb again
throughout the region.


The Cities
Places More Violent Than New York

Most cities in the New York metropolitan area have seen a drop in both violent
and property crime since 1990. Among other cities, Newark, Jersey City, New
Haven and Yonkers each reported fewer violent crimes in 1996 than they did six
years ago.

But compared with the drop in New York City, the decline has not been as heavy
in several of the region's largest cities. For example, in Newark, which has had
the region's highest crime rate for many years, there were 100 murders last
year, compared with 112 in 1990, a decline of 11 percent in a city of 260,000.
At the same time in New York City, with a population of 7.3 million, there were
983 murders in 1996, down from 2,245 in 1990, a decline of 56 percent.

In 1996, Newark, New Haven, Trenton, Bridgeport, Jersey City, East Orange, N.J.,
and Irvington, N.J., each had higher violent crime rates than New York City.

Some experts said they feared that the recent emphasis on falling crime rates in
New York City might create a false sense that the problem in smaller cities had
been addressed. Marcus Felson, a professor at the Rutgers University School of
Criminal Justice in Newark, said that Newark and other cities still had
conditions that he said are inevitably linked to high crime rates: large
abandoned areas, weak economies and a growing group of school-age children about
to enter adolescence.

The emphasis on crime-rate improvements, he said, created the danger that those
areas might be left out of a regional discussion about how to reduce crime.
"When you have high crime rates," Mr. Felson said, "even noticeable improvements
in crime rates leave you with a high crime rate."

Violent crime reported in Newark declined 13 percent from 1990 through 1996. But
the violent crime rate, which is the incidence of crime per 100,000 people, was
3,364. That was lower than in 1980, but it was more than double the violent
crime rate in New York City, 1,324 in 1996.


The Suburbs
Pockets of Crime Mar Safer Areas

More than 10.9 million people in the metropolitan area live in suburbs, and to
the extent that some of them do so to escape crime, recent statistics validate
that choice.

Suburban New York, Connecticut and New Jersey have much lower crime rates than
New York or the region's other cities, and crime is declining, the analysis
shows. When violent crime fell in New York City by 34 percent from 1990 through
1995, it fell 13 percent in the metropolitan area outside the big cities.

When the region's cities are removed from the calculation, 17 of the 26 counties
in the metropolitan area showed declines in violent crime from 1990 through
1995, with the biggest drops in Putnam and Suffolk Counties in New York, and
Monmouth, Warren and Somerset Counties in New Jersey. The property crimes of
burglary, larceny and auto theft fell in 24 of the 26 counties during those five
years. Only Rockland and Sullivan Counties in New York had rises in property
crimes.

Even in the nine counties where suburban crime has increased, the level of crime
is much lower than the big cities. When the cities with at least 100,000 people
or high murder rates in 1990 were removed from the crime statistics, the
remainder of the metropolitan area had a violent crime rate less than one-sixth
the rate of the big cities in the region.

Still, local law enforcement officials say the suburbs have their own high-crime
pockets with drug trading and violence.

Monmouth County on the New Jersey shore, for example, is a prosperous area of
bedroom communities. County officials estimate some 30 percent of the largely
middle-class population of 581,000 commutes to New York City or elsewhere.

Crime in Monmouth is much lower than it was in 1980 and declining rapidly. From
1990 through 1995, violent crime fell 25.7 percent. There were 103 reported
rapes in Monmouth in 1995, down from 140 in 1990. Aggravated assault reports
fell to 849 from 1,277 during the same period. Monmouth's violent crime rate of
248 incidents per 100,000 residents is almost identical to the average of 251
for suburban areas in the region.

But local law enforcement officials say the statistics disguise the stubborn
crime problem in Asbury Park, N.J., the faded ocean-front community of 16,000.
Several experts cited Asbury Park as an example of the type of small cities with
serious crime that are dotted across comfortable suburbs of New York.

Mr. Kaye, the Monmouth County Prosecutor, called Asbury Park "one of the worst
drug meccas in the state" and said there was frequent violence among competing
drug dealers. Asbury Park's violent crime rate was 46 percent higher than the
rate in New York City in 1996. While crime rates dropped across the region, the
violent crime rate in Asbury Park increased 23 percent from 1990 through 1996.


The Region
A Ripple Effect From New York

With its hundreds of cities, towns and villages in three states, the New York
metropolitan area is often seen as a group of separate communities. But some law
enforcement officials say recent crime trends show how interconnected the region
is.

In part, they say, the sharp declines in crime across the region show that
social and economic forces may be more important than government in handling
some problems. But they also said that New York City is such an important
regional hub that changes in law enforcement policies there have had a ripple
effect.

In some cases, that effect has added to the crime problem outside the city. In
Mount Vernon last year, the police said they observed an influx of prostitution.
When they investigated, they discovered that officers in the 47th Precinct in
the Bronx had begun a crackdown. The prostitutes, the Mount Vernon police
concluded, simply walked up White Plains Road and across the border into Mount
Vernon.

In Rockland County, one of the suburban counties where both property and violent
reported crime climbed from 1990 through 1995, District Attorney Michael E.
Bongiorno said he had sometimes noted a correlation between crackdowns on drug
trafficking in New York City and jumps in crime in Rockland.

But officials also say that New York City's influence has been much more
profound than simply as an exporter of crime. Across the region, there are more
police officers on the streets and a new eagerness to try new policing
techniques, including "park and walk" programs and other plans to bring officers
in closer contact with residents. Some officials say they have been influenced
in such moves by the policies of New York's Mayors David N. Dinkins and Rudolph
W. Giuliani and by Mr. Giuliani's first police commissioner, William J. Bratton.

In Suffolk County, on Long Island, where crime has dropped more sharply than in
New York City since 1990, Police Commissioner John C. Gallagher said his
department and many others grew while new York City was increasing its police
force.

After freezing the Suffolk County police force at 2,000 officers until 1991, the
department has grown to about 2,750 officers. Mr. Gallagher said the fact that
reported crime declined as the Suffolk department was growing was a challenge to
the assertion of some criminologists that the size of police forces cannot
affect crime.

In some places, the echo of New York City's crime-fighting history is
unmistakable. For example, Stamford, Conn., with about 107,000 people, which has
long had one of the lowest crimes rates for a city its size anywhere in the
nation, has a new Mayor, Dannel P. Malloy, who is a former New York City
prosecutor.

When he ran for office two years ago, Mr. Malloy said he would make crime
-fighting a top priority. In office he has worked closely with Police Chief G.
Patrick Tully, in a quality-of-life campaign like the one promoted by Mr.
Bratton in New York City to discourage panhandlers in the downtown area.

Chief Tully said the similarity was not entirely coincidence. "I believe," he
said, in what he called "the precepts Commissioner Bratton articulated: Holding
people accountable and concentrating on quality-of-life crimes because they
contribute to the bigger crimes."

Violent crime fell 15 percent in Stamford in 1996 from 1995, to the lowest level
since at least 1980.

The declines in crime rates in the 26-county region surrounding New York City
have not been as rapid as in the five boroughs. But the analysis by The New York
Times shows a sharp, widespread drop in reported violent crimes (murder, rape,
robbery, aggravated assault) and property crimes (burglary, auto theft, larceny)
since 1990, in both cities and suburbs. The picture is hardly a uniform one,
though: in the suburban areas of nine counties, the violent crime rate increased
from 1990 to 1995.

8 Mafia Members Convicted of Racketeering

BYLINE: AP

SECTION: Section B; Page 7; Column 2; National Desk; Law Page

LENGTH: 574 words

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Aug. 8


Eight New England organized crime figures were convicted today of racketeering
in a case Federal prosecutors boasted would break the back of the Patriarca
crime family, which the authorities say has controlled the loan-sharking and
gambling in New England since the 1940's.

The verdict came on the 15th day of jury deliberations.

The eight defendants were among 21 alleged members and associates of the
Patriarca crime family indicted in March 1990. A sweeping Federal indictment
charged various defendants with gambling, loan-sharking and murder to support
the crime family, which is based in Providence, R.I.

Seven other defendants will be tried in Boston this fall, including Raymond J.
Patriarca, who prosecutors maintain was the family's boss until he was deposed
after the indictment last year. The other six defendants pleaded guilty in
return for reduced sentences.

Three of the defendants convicted today were found guilty in the 1989 slaying of
William Grasso, the family's boss in Connecticut, and a fourth was found guilty
of conspiracy in Mr. Grasso's death.

The authorities say they believe Mr. Grasso was killed because leaders of the
family's Boston faction suspected he and Mr. Patriarca were maneuvering to grab
more control over the Boston rackets.

The three-month trial provided a glimpse into the workings of the Mafia,
including what was described as the first recording of a Mafia induction
ceremony.

All of the defendants were charged with violating Federal racketeering statutes
by committing various crimes to support the family's illegal gambling and
loan-sharking businesses. Convicted in Mr. Grasso's killing were Gaetano Milano,
who fired the fatal shot, Frank Colantoni Jr. and Louis Pugliano. Frank
Pugliano, was found guilty of conspiracy.

Convicted on other charges were Nicholas Bianco of Providence; Salvatore
D'Aquila of Middletown; Louis Failla, a reputed mob soldier from East Hartford,
and Americo Petrillo, a reputed soldier from Old Saybrook.

Murder Jarred Hierarchy

The prosecution's case got a boost last summer when two other defendants, John
F. Castagna and his son, Jack Johns, decided to testify in return for reduced
sentences.

Mr. Castagna and Mr. Johns testified that they participated in three failed
attempts to kill Mr. Grasso, before he was killed on June 13, 1989.

Federal authorities said the Grasso murder appeared to shake the crime family's
hierarchy, weakening the status of Mr. Patriarca, who they said took over
control of the crime family when his father, Raymond L. S. Patriarca Sr., died
of a heart attack in 1984.

The defense took only one week to present its case, and concentrated on
rebutting the testimony of Mr. Castagna and Mr. Johns.

In another organized-crime case a purported chief of the Mafia in western
Massachusetts linked to at least one of the Hartford defendants was charged
today in Springfield, Mass., in what prosecutors described as a failed
assassination attempt.

Adolfo Bruno, 45, of Agawam, Mass., was arraigned late this morning in Hampden
County Superior Court before Judge William Simons on charges of conspiracy to
murder. A not guilty plea was entered, and bail was set at $20,000.

The action came after a county grand jury returned a secret indictment against
Mr. Bruno on Wednesday. It says Mr. Bruno conspired with Mr. Castagna, John
Nettis, Francesco Scibelli and others in the attempt to murder Joseph N. Maruca.

THE REGION;
THE UNDERWORLD HITS AND RUNS ON 42nd STREET

BYLINE: By Alan Finder and Mary Connelly

SECTION: Section 4; Page 6, Column 1; Week in Review Desk

LENGTH: 312 words


In New York, Boston and Kansas City, Federal prosecutors have begun what they
describe as the Government's largest crackdown yet on organized crime. In New
York alone, the reputed leaders of the region's five major organized-crime
factions, along with dozens of associates, are on trial or under indictment.

Last week, however, the shadowy figures who control the underworld demonstrated
on the streets of New York that they can still dispense their own style of
justice. At about 5:30 P.M. Monday, as workers streamed out of offices on East
46th Street between Second and Third Avenues, two or three men approached Paul
Castellano, the reputed chief of the nation's most powerful Mafia group, and an
aide, Thomas Bilotti, as they were about to enter a steakhouse. The gunmen drew
semi-automatic weapons from under their trenchcoats, opened fire and left Mr.
Castellano and Mr. Bilotti lying dead beside the open doors of their limousine.

Law enforcement officials speculated that the murders would not have been
attempted without the sanction of the heads of New York's four other crime
''families.'' The director of the state's Organized Crime Task Force said the
leaders may have been concerned that Mr. Castellano's legal problems and a
simmering dispute within his own faction, the Gambino group, were endangering
them all. In addition to individual cases against the reputed New York chiefs,
all five were indicted this year on charges that they sat on a ''commission''
that regulates organized-crime activities.

Mr. Castellano, along with nine other defendants, had been on trial since
September on charges of operating a car-theft ring and conspiring to commit
murders and other crimes. After the killings, the trial was recessed until Jan.
6, when Judge Kevin Thomas Duffy of Federal District Court is expected to rule
on a defense motion for a mistrial.

THE state police reported that major crime in Connecticut declined by 16.6
percent during the first three months of 1982 compared with the same period last
year, according to summaries from the state's 96 organized police agencies.

In the five larger cities, the shift in the overall crime index, which measures
seven major crimes against people and property, ranged from a decline of 19.5
percent in New Haven to 9.2 percent in Waterbury. Only 12 municipalities
reported increases in crime.

''I'd have to say we were surprised when we saw the data because it's the first
real marked decrease there has been since we started compiling the
information,'' said Sgt. Thomas O'Connor, head of the State Police Crime
Analysis Unit. He said the unit could not pinpoint the causes behind changing
crime rates ''because there are so many factors, from age, to weather, to
socioeconomic trends.''

The state police records show that the decreases so far this year followed a
trend that began in April 1981. The crime rate dropped during the last three
quarters of 1981 between 3.5 percent and 8.7 percent compared with the same
period in 1980.

The crime index measures the seven most serious crimes: murder, rape, robbery,
aggravated assault, burglary, larceny and motor vehicle theft.

In the first three months of the year, the data show, burglary statewide dropped
29 percent compared with the same period in 1981.  Robberies were down 19.1
percent.

Hamden, the largest town to experience an increase, saw its crime rate rise 18.6
percent, largely in larcenies. Farmington's crime rate went up 16.1 percent.

Since 1978, the state has been publishing annual surveys of the crime index.
Last year it reported that crime increased about 11 percent over all in 1980
compared with 1979.

William F. Roche, director of administration for the New Haven Police
Department, said that a wiser use of law enforcement resources was beginning to
pay off. Reflecting a widely held view among specialists about public attitudes
on crime, he said: ''The public as a whole doesn't have the total picture. They
see what's in the media and they see two crimes in their neighborhood and think
it is a crime wave.''

After six years of financial difficulty, the Hartford Civic Center is expected
to report a surplus of more than $200,000 when its fiscal year ends Wednesday.
This follows a series of complaints by residents that because of annual deficits
city taxpayers have had to foot the bill for events that attracted a largely
suburban audience.

Frank E. Russo Jr., executive director of the center, emphasized that
establishment of a semi-autonomous authority to operate the facility had played
a role in the financial turnaround. He said he felt that the surplus should be
kept in a reserve account to cover unanticipated equipment costs.

Mr. Russo credited the improved financial picture to the fact that the authority
was able to limit managerial issues and ''get down to the business of running a
good center.''

''I don't want to confuse the issue by saying we deserve all the credit,'' he
said. ''But if we were even given part of the credit, it would go a long way
toward revealing some of the benefits, in terms of revenue, that go back to the
city.''

City officials, worried about how residents felt about the center, have stressed
the indirect benefits to Hartford, such as a boom in downtown development,
increased parking revenue and new jobs.  Community organizations have criticized
the way the city has operated the facility in the past. But members of the City
Council are elated at the prospect of being able to eliminate a $210,000 subsidy
that was scheduled for the new fiscal year.

How popular the center is was demonstrated last week, when about 3,000 delegates
of the United Presbyterian Church in the United States met there for its 194th
General Assembly.

Some people might accuse Richard C. Bozzuto, a Republican gubernatorial hopeful,
of putting the cart before the horse. Even though the Watertown politician's
campaign faces several major tests, including next month's Republican State
Convention, a possible September primary and the general election in November,
Mr.  Bozzuto is already at work looking for people to fill the top jobs in his
administration.

He recently sent out 250 letters to Republican town chairmen, Republican state
central committeemen, and other key party leaders, asking for their
recommendations on individuals who would be qualified to head commissions and
hold other high-level posts so that ''we can build an administration second to
none.''

The three-to-four-dozen replies already received are on file at Mr. Bozzuto's
home for his review when he has time between campaign appearances.

Mr. Bozzuto doesn't agree with those who think it would be better to win the
Republican nomination first, and then worry about shaping an administration. His
letter to party officials read in part: ''Republicans at every level have a
right and a responsibility to participate in the selection of administration
officials. The process must begin now!''

''I happen to be an administrator and an organizer, and I think these things
have to be done well in advance,'' said Mr. Bozzuto, who sells insurance when
not working in politics. He's got a pretty good head start. Connecticut's next
governor won't be sworn in until Jan.  5, 1983.

This is the time of year when farmers in Connecticut begin to strut their stuff.
With good weather, the strawberry crop should be ready for picking. And other
produce will show up in farmers' markets already open in Stamford and Hartford.

As for the strawberries, they may not be as plentiful as in the past because
floodwaters three weeks ago devastated many crops in low-lying areas and delayed
maturation on higher ground. The Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation
Service reports that in New Haven County, for example, at least 40 percent of
the berries are rotting because of flooded fields.

However, the Connecticut Department of Agriculture reports that pickings are
good at some farms in Fairfield, Hartford, Ridgefield, Middlesex, New London,
Tolland and Windham Counties. At the Old Cider Mill in Glastonbury, Patty
Beckett reported ''a very good crop,'' and at the Strawberry Valley Farm in
Cheshire Judith Ushchak said the berries were ripening slowly but were of good
quality.

Meanwhile, the farmers were back in the major cities. In Hartford, the fourth
annual market has opened in the Asylum Hill neighborhood.  Fifteen booths are
open every Wednesday from 10 A.M. to 2 P.M. and feature homemade jam in addition
to fresh vegetables.

Harold Peterson, a spokesman for the sponsors of the market, said that ''fresh
food was being brought into the urban situation.'' He added that ''farmers are
beginning to grow stuff that meets the demands of the urban population.''
Strawberries, lettuce, turnips and spinach have been the specialty so far.

In Stamford, the popular Farmer's Market at Glenbrook Road, not far from the
railroad station, is again in full swing, having added charcoal for those who
prefer outdoor cooking. Liberal space for offstreet parking is available to
patrons.

Optimism is the rule in Mystic these days because ground has been broken for a
new, $1.25 million community center and the funds are on hand for its completion
by next spring. The sponsors have sought permanent quarters for 35 years.

The old center, in operation since 1959, was based in a garage in the downtown
area. It had been used not only by residents of Mystic but also by many who live
in adjacent Groton and Stonington.

Jane Donnel, president of the center, echoed the sentiment of many when she said
that she had felt that ''this would never happen.'' The new center, to be
constructed on a 14-acre site at Williams Beach, on the eastern end of Mystic,
will be a 26,000-square-foot building, partially solar-heated. It will be built
in the area now used by the center for its outdoor summer program, including
swimming, tennis and softball.

Although supporters have contributed more than the $1.25 million needed for
construction, officials said they would continue to seek funds ''as long as the
potential is there.'' The old center, they said, was inadequate for the programs
requested by young and old residents.

Washington: Office of Justice Programs Awards More Than $5.6 Million to Enable
Information, Technology Sharing to Reduce Crime

LENGTH: 505  words

DATELINE: New York



 Washington: US Department of Justice has issued the following news release:



 The Office of Justice Programs' Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) today
announced funding of more than $5.6 million through two separate programs.  One
is a new initiative designed to help communities reduce and prosecute gun crime;
the other is an annual grant that enables jurisdictions to leverage technology
and information sharing to enhance criminal justice operations.





 Nearly $3 million was awarded to three cities--Metropolitan Police Dept. of the
District of Columbia ($999,129), Wisconsin's Milwaukee Police Dept. ($1
million), and the City of Los Angeles ($1 million)--via BJA's National Crime Gun
Intelligence Center Initiative, a newly developed initiative in 2016.  The
program, which is supported and administered in partnership between BJA and the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), supports the
implementation of three crime gun intelligence centers in the above listed
cities.  These centers employ multidisciplinary teams to identify perpetrators
and connect criminal activity and sources of gun crime for immediate disruption,
investigation and prosecution.  Each site will also work closely with a research
partner to help guide implementation and evaluate program outcomes.



 Another $2.6 million was awarded to six cities and the Washington, D.C.-based
Police Foundation ($499,826) to enhance information sharing capacities through
the use of innovative technological solutions to reduce crime.  Funded through
BJA's annual competitive grant Technology Innovation for Public Safety Program,
the resources provided through this grant are intended to help selectees address
a precipitous or extraordinary increase in crime in individual jurisdictions.
To combat this, awardees are enabled to share information across crime-fighting
agencies.  This collaboration can help address specific local crime problems,
which often require multidisciplinary responses involving public safety
agencies, personnel and shared investment in technology.



 "The Office of Justice Programs is committed to giving our state and local
partners the tools they need to drive down crime and maintain public safety for
the long run," said Assistant Attorney General Karol V. Mason of the Office of
Justice Programs.  "These new resources will expand community capability to
investigate and prosecute gun offenses and support data sharing and other
technological solutions to serious violence challenges."



 The six cities and police departments awarded under the Technology Innovation
for Public Safety Program include: the New Castle County Division of Police,
Del. ($306,700); the City of Hartford, Connecticut ($245,681); the City of
Cincinnati, Ohio ($370,673); the Los Angeles Police Department ($395,717); the
City of Memphis, Tennessee ($401,193); and the St. Louis, Missouri, County
Government ($400,636).

Wage war on hate crimes

BYLINE: Mark Moskowitz; For the AJC

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 10A

LENGTH: 430 words


The savage attack on parishioners at Emanuel AME Church occurred in one of only
five states that cannot legally recognize this act for what it is: a vicious
hate crime. Hate crimes laws are an essential tool for countering such
bias-motivated violence and mitigating its impact. One of the most constructive
ways for South Carolina and its neighbor Georgia --- one of the other five
states --- to honor the victims is by enacting hate crimes laws.

Hate crimes laws are more than just a vehicle for increasing sentences for
criminals who target victims based on race, religion or other personal
characteristics. They also provide a way for society to recognize that these
crimes strike special fear within victimized groups, fragment communities and
tear at the very fabric of our democratic way of life.

Every major police organization in the country has supported hate crime laws ---
because they understand the special impact of these crimes. The FBI has been
collecting hate crime data from the 18,000 police agencies across the country
since 1990. In 2013, the most recent FBI data available, almost 6,000 hate
crimes were committed --- almost one every 90 minutes of every day.

Despite the unique societal impact of hate crimes and decades of data
demonstrating the utility of these laws, some policy opponents argue that hate
crimes laws punish thought or religious speech. Not true. Americans are free to
believe and say whatever they want. Hate crimes punish criminal acts --- such as
murder, assault and vandalism. Just like any criminal case, hate crime laws
require bias motive to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.

Others may wrongly argue that hate crimes laws provide special rights for
certain minorities. But hate crime laws are colorblind. These laws protect all
Americans --- whether in the minority or majority --- by covering crimes when
the victim is targeted because of race, religion, sexual orientation, or other
personal characteristics.

It would be naive to think that racism and bigotry can be legislated away.
However, strong, inclusive hate crimes laws, and effective responses to hate
violence by public officials and law enforcement authorities, are essential
components in deterring and preventing these crimes.

Charleston was a wake-up call for many about the dangers of unchecked hatred and
bigotry in America. Just as Gov. Nikki Haley recognized that "it is time" for
the Confederate flag to be removed from the South Carolina Statehouse grounds,
it is time for South Carolina and Georgia to join the 45 other states that
already have hate crimes laws.

Number of hate crimes steady in California, but more reported against Latinos
last year

BYLINE: By Matt O'Brien Contra Costa Times

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 268 words


The number of hate crimes against Latinos in California spiked by about 47
percent last year after a decade of decline, according to a state report
released Thursday.

Reports of violence and vandalism motivated by bias remained steady in number
last year, but Latinos were victims in more of these crimes. The state attorney
general's office recorded 119 anti-Latino crimes in 2010, up from 81 in 2009,
although the 2009 number was the lowest in at least a decade.

Anti-black bias remains the top motivation for hate crimes, representing about
29 percent of the more than 1,100 hate crimes reported statewide, but the number
of hate crimes against African-Americans has been declining. Also among the most
prevalent, but declining, motivations for hate crimes are anti-gay and
anti-Jewish bias.

"A crime that is motivated by hate is a crime against all people," Attorney
General Kamala Harris said in a statement.

Violent hate crimes also dropped slightly as bias-related property crimes rose.
Fewer were reported at schools and places of worship, but more at restaurants.

San Francisco reported 65 hate crimes, the most in the Bay Area, followed by San
Jose at 24. Livermore, Oakland and the UC Berkeley campus reported 15 hate
crimes each last year.

The report cautioned that many factors can affect the number of hate crimes
reported, including how aggressive local police agencies are in investigating
them and the likelihood of people to report them.

Livermore police Chief Steve Sweeney said almost all of the 15 hate crimes
reported there stemmed from a group of young people that spray painted slurs on
houses.

Waking Up in Missouri

SECTION: EDITORIAL & OPINION; Pg. 8

LENGTH: 629 words


The National Rifle Association's just-concluded convention in Milwaukee has
sparked outrage in some quarters of New York, but jealousy might be a more
appropriate response. The outrage seems to be directed toward members of the NRA
who live outside the New York City metropolitan area and dare to like guns.
Consider a recent column by Michael Daly of the Daily News. He reports on a
"jarring" encounter with one Peggy Irving of Missouri, who brought her
16-month-old daughter Katie to the convention and says she "loves" her Smith &
Wesson 9-mm lady's. He seems astonished that a mother who comes across as "as
decent and amiable a person as you could ever meet" would like guns, and might
even joke about how her infant daughter will one day own a firearm.

Could it just be that Ms. Irving, a humble Missourian, knows something that Mr.
Daly hasn't yet grasped - that there is little clear relationship between gun
control, or gun ownership for that matter, and crime? According to the Federal
Bureau of Investigation's Uniform Crime Report, in 2004, the most recent year
for which complete statistics are available, there were 687.4 violent crimes per
100,000 residents in New York City, of which 7.04 were murders (the vast
majority were robberies or aggravated assaults). We don't know from where in
Missouri Ms. Irving comes, but it almost certainly has a lower crime rate
despite her efforts to instill in her daughter a respect for guns. Columbia,
Missouri, experienced a violent crime rate of 362.1 per 100,000 and a murder
rate of 0.7. Jefferson City reported 279.8 violent crimes per 100,000, and no
murders.

The Kansas City metro area saw 595.6 violent crimes per 100,000, of which 7.9
were murders. Missouri's gun laws are significantly less restrictive than those
in New York - residents need a permit only to carry a handgun, and otherwise
they don't need to register or license their firearms. Kansas City proper has
long been a crime hotspot, and it has the high murder rate to match - 19.9 per
100,000 within the city limits. Yet even then, the murder rate appears only
loosely correlated with gun control, something that was suggested by a famous
experiment, often cited by proponents of gun control, conducted between 1992 and
1993.Police in the inner city volunteered for overtime shifts and during those
shifts did nothing but hunt for guns that were illegal under existing law. Crime
did go down by 49%, but not in proportion to gun seizures, which increased 67%.

Instead, what crime statistics from across Missouri show is the truth of a point
made by the FBI itself right at the top of its annual crime report: Many factors
cause crime. The FBI offers its own list, from "population density and degree of
urbanization" to "modes of transportation and highway system" to "effective
strength of law enforcement agencies" to "citizens' attitudes toward crime."
Although arguably included in the broad category of "policies of ... components
of the justice system," gun control per se doesn't make an appearance on the
list. By the way, we're looking at the list in the 1997 report, published in the
thick of the Clinton administration.

New York has been racked in recent months with a spate of tragic gun crimes,
including the death of a two-year-old on Easter morning in the Bronx. The city
grieves with the families of the victims, and applauds recent high-profile
enforcement actions conducted by Commissioner Ray Kelly and New York's Finest.
It would be a mistake, however, to think that more gun control will solve that
problem. Taking a gun out of Ms. Irving's hands will not make New York safer.
Nor will refusing law-abiding New Yorkers the right to keep and bear arms that
is guaranteed to all Americans in the Second Amendment to the Constitution.

Reported Crimes Drop in Montgomery

Reported crimes fell 5.4 percent in Montgomery County last year compared to
1997, a decline that followed national trends and brought crime in the county to
its lowest overall rate in the 1990s, police said yesterday.

Burglaries were the only serious crime that grew, with about 60 more reported in
1998 than the previous year, a 1.5 percent increase, police said. The county had
12 homicides in 1998, down from 22 in 1997. Rapes fell by 8 percent, robberies
by 15 percent, aggravated assaults by 13 percent and car thefts by 14 percent.

Adult arrests for the year rose 3.5 percent compared to 1997, while juvenile
arrests increased 6 percent.

Health Department to Evaluate Editor

A Mount Airy man who has pleaded not criminally responsible in the death of his
wife will be evaluated by the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene,
according to J. Charles Smith, the Frederick County assistant state's attorney
handling the case. The evaluation will be conducted at the Clifton T. Perkins
Hospital Center in Jessup.

Donald Wayne Holt, 44, has been charged with first-degree murder in the
strangling death of his wife, Nancy Holt, last month. On Monday, Holt's lawyer
told a Frederick County Circuit Court judge that not only did Holt not
appreciate the criminality of his conduct at the time of his wife's death, but
also that Holt is not mentally competent to stand trial now, Smith said.

Holt, a senior editor of the Journal of the National Cancer Institute in
Bethesda, waived his right to a bond hearing Monday and is being held without
bond at the Frederick County Adult Detention Center, where he has been since his
Feb. 6 arrest.

Man, 78, Charged in Shooting Is Unfit for Trial

A 78-year-old Baltimore man charged with fatally shooting one of four teenagers
in a brick-throwing incident last summer has been found by psychiatrists to be
mentally unable to stand trial.

Albert Sims suffers from organic brain damage and "has no comprehension of the
criminal charges against him," Sims's attorney, Mitchell A. Greenberg, said
yesterday. He said that was the finding of psychiatrists for the prosecution and
the defense.

Sims, a former janitor whose hearing and vision also are impaired, allegedly
fired two shots with a .25-caliber semiautomatic pistol on July 5, killing
16-year-old Jermaine Jordan as Jordan and three other youths fled from the front
of Sims's inner-city row house. Police said one of the youths had thrown a brick
at Sims's parked car.

Greenberg said the next step will be a court hearing March 23 to determine
whether Sims is dangerous and should be confined or released "until such time as
he may be found competent" to stand trial.

THE DISTRICT

D.C. Detective Robbed in Northwest

An off-duty D.C. homicide detective was robbed at gunpoint yesterday morning as
he got out of his unmarked police vehicle in the 1300 block of Taylor Street NW,
D.C. police said.

The detective, whose identity was not released because he is considered a
witness, was not injured, said Sgt. Joe Gentile, a police spokesman. The
detective was approached by two men as he got out of his car at 2:30 a.m.,
Gentile said. The men forced the detective back into the car. One man sat next
to him in the passenger seat and the other sat behind him, Gentile said.

When the men noticed the vehicle's emergency lights, one man patted the officer
down, found his Glock 26 and took it from him, Gentile said. The men reportedly
also stole the detective's billfold, a watch, a portable CD player and a
cellular telephone.

All of the detective's property -- except his gun -- was recovered in the 1200
block of Taylor Street NW shortly after the robbery, Gentile said. No arrests
had been made as of yesterday evening.

Police asked anyone with information to call the 4th District station at
202-576-6745.

Statistics are helping change people's behavior Poll respondents; Media distort
the situation

BYLINE: Patrick O'Driscoll

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 14A

LENGTH: 627 words


Four years ago, Detroit business analyst Pat Barnes became a crime
statistic. Her home was burglarized.

But Barnes, 35, says it didn't make her more cautious than she
already was. "Crime is not a major fear in my life," says the
divorced mother of a 3-year-old girl. "I really have a problem
with people not doing what they need or want to do because they're
afraid of crime."


Her point of view may be catching on. A new USA TODAY/CNN/Gallup
Poll of Barnes and more than 1,000 other Americans finds that
the steady drop in major crime this decade is beginning to register
with people.

Although five in 10 of those questioned still believe crime in
the USA is higher than is was a year ago, that's far less than
the almost nine in 10 who thought that was the case in 1992. That
was the year when major crime across across America began a dramatic
decline, now six years and counting.

"Historically, (people) have always been extraordinarily likely
to say there's more crime," says Frank Newport, editor-in-chief
of the Gallup Poll. "But last year, the percent saying more was
lower, and it's true this year. The reports of (crime) statistics
nationally are finally creeping through to people."

In the national poll of 1,013 adults, 48% see less crime in their
own locales than a year ago. Just 31% say such crime is worse
than last year. It's the first time in 10 different years of asking
the question that Gallup found more Americans saying crime in
their neighborhoods was dropping.

That's the reverse of what poll subjects told Gallup last year.
In an August 1997 survey, 46% said there was more crime in their
neighborhoods than the year before, while 32% said there was less.

Across the board, more people are less worried about becoming
victims of murder, mugging, burglary and rape than they were five
years ago. Almost 80% say they seldom fear being attacked while
driving their cars, despite widely publicized worries about "road
rage."

Fifty-six percent still believe there is more crime nationally
today than there was five years ago. And 47% say they feel more
threatened by crime today than in 1993.

Gallup's Newport suggests that's because of a familiar phenomenon
in polls: People tend to say things are worse nationally than
in their own neighborhoods.

The telephone poll was conducted Oct. 23-25. The results have
a margin of error of +/- 3 percentage points.

The poll also shows more confidence in police's ability to shield
people from violent crime. Fifty-five percent say they have a
lot of trust that police can do so, a 10-point increase over five
years ago.

"The few experiences I have had, like calling the sheriff, it's
been good. They've been right on the spot," says retired homemaker
Jane Risk, 87, of Indianapolis, another of those polled. "That
gives you confidence."

But 45% still doubt police can do much to protect citizens from
violent crime. "The police department is a response organization.
When you call, they respond," says gun-rights advocate D.C. Morgan,
46, of Denham Springs, La., who has friends in law enforcement
and a brother who's an officer. "But they can't be there when
it happens to you. They come in and pick up the pieces."

The poll shows strong agreement on one point: 82% of Americans
believe TV news and entertainment programs show more crime and
violence than they did five years ago.

"I was overly fearful before I really knew the status of crime,"
says poll respondent Jeff Shane, 33, a Charlottesville, Va., veterinarian
who volunteers in a religious ministry to prison inmates. "On
television, everything is Law and Order and Homicide.
For the majority of us, that's not the reality."

RISE IN TEENAGE CRIME WORRIES FBI

BYLINE: MARTIN WALKER IN WASHINGTON

SECTION: THE GUARDIAN FOREIGN PAGE; Pg. 7

LENGTH: 505 words


VIOLENT crime in the US rose by 4 per cent last year, according to FBI crime
statistics released yesterday. Most of the increase was attributed to the
teenage group aged 15-19, who accounted for 16 per cent of the 24,703 murders
committed.

Almost half, 46 per cent, of all those arrested were under 25. But the teenage
violent crime rate most concerned the FBI. In 1980, fewer than 20 of every
100,000 youths of 19 years of age or under were arrested for murder. Last year,
49 of every 100,000 youths were arrested for murder.

"The surge in juvenile violent crime arrests has a broad base, and since it is
projected that the juvenile population will increase significantly by the year
2000, these increases in juvenile violence may continue into the future," the
FBI director, William Sessions, said.

Violent crime is a specific category which includes murder, rape, armed robbery
and aggravated assault. Just under 2 million such crimes were committed last
year. Firearms were used in 31 per cent of them. This category is rising at a
much faster rate than crime in general. The overall rate of 758 violent crimes
for every 10,000 Americans last year represents a 34 per cent increase over the
past 10 years.

Law and order, which remains a potent political issue, no longer automatically
benefits the Republican Party, which has long prided itself on its tough
approach to crime. The increase in violent crime over the past 10 years, when
Republicans controlled the White House, undermines their claim.

The Democratic presidential candidate, Bill Clinton, who supports the death
penalty and has signed two execution warrants in his state of Arkansas this
year, has pledged to put an extra 100,000 police officers on the streets, in
addition to the 535,000 law enforcement officers already employed.

All crimes, including non-violent and property crimes, rose by 3 per cent last
year to 15 million, and the total cost of the goods stolen was $ 16 billion.
This was the highest figure ever recorded, 10 per cent higher than in 1987, and
15 per cent higher than in 1982.

"There are two things which hold true in the world of violent crime," the
attorney-general, William Barr, said yesterday. "First, a disproportionate
amount of violent crime is committed by a relatively small group of chronic,
violent offenders."

"Second, prosecutors and police officers must be given the tools necessary to
indentify and incarcerate this hard-core group. All too often, law enforcement's
hard work is undermined by a revolving door justice system that puts career
criminals back on the street before they have served their entire sentence."

The national murder rate rose last year to one murder for every 10,000 people,
but in some cities the figure was far higher. In Washington DC, the most
murder-prone city in the country, the rate last year was eight murders for every
10,000 people - proportionately more dangerous for US citizens than Vietnam
during the 10 years of US military involvement.

Violent crime up in U.S., down by 14% in Atlanta; But city's rate still tops the
nation, report says

The number of violent crimes in the United States rose 10 percent last year
while it dropped 14 percent in Atlanta, the FBI reported Sunday.

Homicides in Atlanta fell from 246 in 1989 to 231 in 1990; armed robbery dropped
from 6,796 to 6,109; and rapes increased from 691 to 695 -  statistics the Metro
Atlanta Crime Commission released earlier this year.

In a per capita ranking of the FBI figures compiled by the Detroit Free Press,
Atlanta had the overall highest rate of violent crime. It ranked Atlanta third
in the number of murders and assaults and second in rape when comparing crime
with population.

Traditionally, the FBI and other law enforcement officials have discouraged
rankings of cities.

"It's inappropriate to rank without looking at several factors," said J. Harper
Wilson, chief of the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting Program. "A city with more
confidence in law enforcement will be more likely to report crimes because they
think police will do something about it.

"Also, some people come in cities and bring crimes."

Many criminologists don't consider the annual FBI report a reliable indicator of
crime trends because it covers only reported crime.

The nation's overall crime rate rose 1 percent, the FBI said, but an increase in
homicide, rape, armed robbery and aggravated assault pushed the violent crime
rate up nationally.

In Atlanta, the number of overall crimes dropped from 88,241 to 75,793, a
decrease of 14 percent, the FBI reported.

W.J. Taylor, commander of field operations for Atlanta police, said he could not
comment on the city's ranking by the Detroit newspaper and expressed caution at
the drop in crime.

"Crime is very cyclical," he said. "I don't think we would say we've done
marvelous things that will keep crime down. Let's just see where we are next
year."

According to the FBI, these other major crimes decreased in Atlanta from 1989:

Assaults dropped to 9,062 from 9,119.

Burglaries dropped to 15,519 from 17,202

Larceny theft dropped to 33,020 from 42,660.

Motor vehicle theft dropped to 11,157 from 11,527.

Nationally, politicians and law enforcement officials such as Attorney General
Dick Thornburgh have expressed a need for major federal legislation to impede
the rising crime rate.

"The president and Congress must pass tough measures to fight crime, ban killer
assault guns and combat the epidemic of violence against women before the death
toll grows even higher," said Sen. Joseph R. Biden (D- Del.), chairman of the
Senate Judiciary Committee.

"The growth in violent crimes is larger than I would have thought," said Alfred
Blumstein, dean of the School of Urban and Public Affairs at Carnegie-Mellon
University in Pittsburgh.

"All-sized cities showed about the same increases as did the regions of the
country," the FBI's Mr. Wilson added. "The South had the highest - a 13 percent
increase in violent crime."

7 cities lead violence 'epidemic'

BYLINE: Sam Vincent Meddis

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 1A

LENGTH: 307 words


Violent crime in the USA soared 10% in 1990 - with seven cities accounting for
more than a quarter of the slayings reported to FBI.

The dramatic surge in violent crimes, 21% since 1987, continues to be driven by
drug trafficking, experts say.

''The nation has got to wake up to the fact that we're in an epidemic of
violence,'' says Barry Krisberg, National Council on Crime and Delinquency.

No. 1 among the seven deadliest cities was New York with 2,245 killings, up 18%
from 1,905 in 1989.

''It's the availability of drugs and ... handguns,'' says New York City Deputy
Police Chief Michael Markman.

The next six and their 1990 homicide statistics:

- Los Angeles, 983, up 12% from 877.

- Chicago, 850, up 15% from 742.

- Houston, 568, up 24% from 459.

- Detroit, 582, down 7% from 624.

- Philadelphia, 503, up 5.9% from 475.

- Washington, 472, up 8.8% from 434. The nation's capital led in killings per
capita.

Nationwide, there were an estimated 23,200 slayings. At least 20 cities set
records.

The FBI's preliminary study of 1990 crimes, based on local police reports, found
that all crime rose only 1%:

- Robbery was up 11%.

- Assault was up 10%.

- Forcible rape was up 9%.

- Homicide was up 10%.

In non-violent crimes:

- Burglary was down 4%.

- Larceny theft was unchanged.

- Car theft was up 5%.

''The president and Congress must pass tough measures to fight crime, ban killer
assault guns and combat the epidemic of violence against women before the death
toll grows even higher,'' said Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., chairman of the Senate
Judiciary Committee.

FBI figures show the largest growth in crime was in the Northeast and Midwest.

Most crimes still are committed in big cities and suburban areas, both of which
recorded increases last year.

Crimes reported in rural areas fell 1%.

7-day series re-examines campus crime

BYLINE: Pat Ordovensky

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 1A

LENGTH: 182 words


At least 18 college students have died in violent crime since the school year
began.

Five student suspects or witnesses have killed themselves.

Others are in hospital beds as victims or jail as criminals.

These are among findings in USA TODAY's ongoing look at crime on college
campuses. A seven-day series will report:

- School-by-school crime rates, derived from our survey of all four-year
colleges with more than 3,000 students.

- The violent crime rate is highest in the South, lowest in the Midwest; safest
is a mid-sized campus in a small town.

- College rape victims write about their ordeal. As one puts it, ''I write in
the hope that rapists might understand what they do to the lives they violate. I
write in the hope that other victims who feel shamed and alone will feel less
so.''

- A violent crime occurs on campus about every 2 hours; a burglary every 27
minutes.

- Hate crimes are smearing academia's reputation as a bastion of tolerance.

- How many colleges are taking steps to protect students.

The campus crime series begins Thursday in USA TODAY.

Bias Crime

Reports of bias crime incidents continued to rise across the region last year
but declined in New York City. Blacks and Jews were by far the most victimized
groups, though in New York state offenses against homosexuals were also
prevalent. New York City experienced 60 percent of the state's total crime but
just 51 percent of the bias crime reported. Last year the United States Supreme
Court ruled that states may impose harsher sentences on criminals who choose
their victims on the basis of race, religion or other personal characteristics.
Connecticut and New Jersey have provisions for harsher penalties for bias
offenses; New York does for offenses against religious institutions. A broader
bias crime bill has been debated for years in New York's Legislature but died
each year in the Republican-led Senate.

A Rights Balancing Act in the Courts

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

SECTION: Section C; Page 16; Column 3; Cultural Desk; Word and Image Page

LENGTH: 479 words


In case you have not heard that the nation's courts are overburdened and
underfinanced, you can hear it repeatedly tonight on "And Justice for All?," the
latest entry of "Listening to America" on public television. Bill Moyers's
guests -- four judges and the United States Solicitor General, Kenneth W. Starr
-- are in general agreement that the courts are not keeping up with crime and
that more money is needed, a solution put forward for many of the problems in
public broadcasting's main election-year series.

One difficulty, as Mr. Moyers keeps reminding his guests, is that the political
will is lacking to provide services to the indigent that would make the judicial
system more equitable. Sol Wachtler, the Chief Judge of New York State, notes
that the courts have no constituency to do political battle on their behalf.
Evidence is presented in two mini-documentaries on the workings of legal aid
offices, one in New Orleans and one in Boston. Both focus on young idealists who
are battling the system.

The argument that the right of all Americans to fair treatment in the courts is
being sacrificed to the demand for a crackdown on crime is easily worth an hour
of television time. But the tension between the rights of people charged with
crimes and the right of most of the nation to live without fear deserves a more
probing discussion than it receives in this drifting hour.

A bit of familiar disagreement is heard: A. Leon Higginbotham Jr., Chief Judge
Emeritus of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in
Philadelphia, holds that social conditions, notably poverty, are at the root of
crime, while Mr. Starr attributes the increase in violent crime to the breakdown
of the family. But there is agreement that the courts as now constituted and
financed are not equipped to deal with the causes of crime, whatever they are;
the judges concede they can do little more than process the criminals.

On the evidence of the anti-crime proclamations of both parties, Mr. Moyers'
desire for more aid to defendants in criminal cases and for the poor in civil
cases is not in prospect. He seems aware that if he were truly listening to
America, he would find that large majorities, perhaps benightedly, would rather
spend what money is available on police, prosecutors and jails than on legal aid
or social services. In the interests of truth in advertising, the producers
might consider retitling some of the programs in this series "Listening to Bill
Moyers."

Crime trend is cause for optimism;
Minneapolis among major U.S. cities headed in right direction.

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 12A

LENGTH: 685 words


With Americans searching for any shred of good news, it's important to take
special note that crime is declining even in the midst of a struggling economy.

Violent crime was down 4.4 percent nationwide in the first half of last year,
and property crime was down 6.1 percent, according to the FBI's preliminary 2009
figures. Murders fell by 10 percent, with the largest drop coming in big cities.

Year-end reports bordered on the astonishing in some of those cities, including
Minneapolis and New York. Minneapolis recorded just 19 homicides last year, down
from 39 in 2008, and a far cry from the 97 killed during the infamous
"Murderapolis" crime wave that peaked in 1995. In New York, fewer people were
murdered last year, 461, than in any year since 1962. Homicides and other
violent crimes also declined in Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, Atlanta, San
Francisco and all but a few other large cities. St. Paul recorded 12 homicides
in 2009, down from 18 the year before.

Altogether, the waning violence and mayhem are part of a positive 20-year trend.
Since the early- to mid-'90s, murders have declined by a remarkable four-fifths
in New York and Minneapolis, and by two-thirds in Los Angeles.

"It is a different world," Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck told the Los
Angeles Times. "There was a time when it was the opposite of today -- when it
seemed there was no limit on the potential for things to get worse and worse.
The whole outlook has shifted now."

The intriguing question is why. Criminology rivals economics as a dismal
science, with experts constantly struggling to explain ups and downs. That crime
should rise along with unemployment and desperation seemed a logical expectation
-- but apparently not.

One sure factor is the decline of gang killings over drug turf. The crack
cocaine epidemic that fed so much of the '90s violence has run its course.
Longer prison sentences, too, may be keeping kingpins and other major criminals
off the streets, helping to make neighborhoods more peaceful. Demographics
surely play a part. An aging population leaves fewer potential perpetrators (and
victims) of prime criminal age. It may also be that the gangster, as a cultural
type, has lost some of his faddish appeal.

Gun enthusiasts claim credit, too, arguing that the rush to buy firearms after
President Obama's election deterred crime. (The gun lobby urged a buying spree
on fears -- unfounded, as it turned out -- that the new president would restrict
handguns and assault rifles.) That scenario is unlikely, however, given that
crime declined both in places with strict and lax gun laws.

Our view is that smarter, more proactive police tactics have contributed most to
crime's decline. Reforms begun in New York in the 1980s are now routine
nationwide. Officers stop known criminals for minor offenses, and guns are often
confiscated. Computerized maps predict crime hot spots, and officers are
dispatched to flood those zones. Gunfire detectors and cameras help patrol high-
crime areas. Closer police-community partnerships have been forged in many
cities. Police administrators are held accountable for lower crime numbers.

"Where police chiefs might have been perfectly willing to say, 'It's the economy
or something else and there's nothing we can do about it,' their bosses --
mayors and city councils -- now know they can and should expect reductions in
crime," Rutgers University criminologist George Kelling told the Los Angeles
Times. "There is now a pressure of, 'If you can't get the job done, we'll find
someone who can.' ''

Two worries linger: the severe budget cuts facing many police forces, and the
news media's continuing obsession with spreading fear. To watch or read the
news, you'd think that many cities were still in the grip of a frightening crime
wave with no end in sight. The numbers tell a different story.

More despair, yet less crime

DATA: Statistics challenge expectations about hardship as a root cause

Conventional wisdom has held that the nation's worst economic downturn since the
Great Depression would fuel a wave of murders, robberies and thefts.

But new reports -- including one from Florida released Wednesday -- show just
the opposite: The overall crime rate in the state fell 8 percent during the
first half of the year, and dropped more sharply in categories such as murder
(19 percent) and robbery (13 percent).

The crime report -- issued by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement --
compares the first half of 2009 with the first half of 2008.

Among the eye-catching numbers:

Overall crime in Charlotte County was down 27.4 percent. Its unemployment rate
is 12.1 percent.

Murders in Florida were down nearly 19 percent and motor vehicle thefts by 23
percent.

The overall state decline of nearly 8 percent marks, by far, the largest drop in
five years. In 2007 and 2008, the overall crime rate increased in Florida during
the same period.

Other areas of the country are seeing similar decreases. Violent crime in the
Baltimore area has dropped 6 percent this year.

In a similar vein, New York City is on pace to have the fewest murders since
officials began keeping records in 1962.

The downward trend has confounded even those who study crime rates.

"I don't have an answer to it," said Andrew Karmen, a criminologist at the John
Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York. "The poor and the unemployed are
not fed up, or in despair. They still retain hope that the economy will turn."

Another factor could be better police work.

Even as departments struggle with budget cuts, many are deploying new crime
-fighting techniques that they say are paying off.

In Sarasota, for example, property crimes were down 12 percent through this
week. Officials say the use of DNA evidence -- in addition to fingerprints and
other traditional methods -- has allowed police to break up big burglary rings.

In Manatee County, a new system divides neighborhoods into districts to help
keep track of crime tendencies in different areas.

The state report shows many agencies, including in Sarasota, Manatee and
Charlotte counties, solving crimes at a higher percentage.

But the increase in clearance rates is still far lower than the overall decrease
in crimes.

"There are too many factors that go into the process of determining crime to put
a finger on one or the other," says Robert Batey, a professor of criminology at
the Stetson University College of Law in Tampa.

"One theory I have heard is that if people have a sense of optimism they are
more likely to continue to be law abiding citizens."

Ron Akers, a professor of Criminology and Sociology at the University of
Florida, said the assumption that a down economy leads to more crime is faulty.

Akers also says crime rates that have dropped for nearly two decades may well be
related to an aging population that is less likely to commit crimes or be
victims, an increased prison population that has removed more criminals from the
public, and a higher awareness for safety with homes and cars.

"You get increases during bad times and you can get decreases during bad times,"
he said.

A Trend Grows In Policing

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

SECTION: Section A; Column 0; Editorial Desk; OP-ED COLUMNIST; Pg. 15

LENGTH: 776 words


One of the better trends to emerge in the U.S. over the past several years has
been the move in many big cities toward more thoughtful ways of fighting crime
-- what I call enlightened policing.

There is a growing awareness in city after city that wielding a police
department like a blunt instrument is counterproductive. If you want to bring
crime down and keep it down, cops have to be smarter.

Ray Kelly, who's been remarkably successful as police commissioner here in New
York, has long embraced this approach. So has Bill Bratton, first in New York
and now in Los Angeles. Dean Esserman is doing interesting things in Providence,
R.I., and Garry McCarthy is trying to haul Newark, at long last, out of the dark
ages of policing.

I'm hardly naive about the existence of police abuse, whether in New York (where
Mr. Kelly has had some dreadful lapses) or elsewhere. But there has been a
definite move in many big cities away from thuggishness as the rule and toward
more enlightened, more effective strategies.

Those who doubt that violent crime is still an enormous problem should consider
the following:

Since Sept. 11, 2001, when the nation's attention understandably turned to the
threat of terrorism, nearly 100,000 people -- men, women and children -- have
been murdered in the U.S.

Each year hundreds of thousands of criminals, having served their terms, are
released into communities with very few jobs and almost no support services for
ex-offenders. These are people with advanced degrees in criminality. In just the
12-month period  ending Dec. 31, approximately 600,000 offenders will have been
released.

The F.B.I. reported this week that violent crime rose in the U.S. in 2006 for
the second year in a row. The more thoughtful members of local law enforcement
already knew that from their own careful studies.

On Wednesday, dozens of police chiefs from around the country met in Chicago to
assess the crime trends that have developed since the beginning of this year.

They are trying to understand why there has been a surge in homicides in big
cities in Florida, and in Baltimore, Washington and Oakland, Calif., at the same
time that there have been substantial decreases in places like Los Angeles,
Houston, Minneapolis, Sacramento and Nashville.

In an echo of the now-famous Compstat system, their goal is to analyze national
crime data with an eye toward developing preventive strategies and squelching
emerging crime trends before they spin out of control. If Los Angeles is doing
something that Baltimore could benefit from, that information should be shared.

This is not sexy stuff, and it doesn't get a lot of public attention. But it
saves lives.

The Chicago gathering was sponsored by the Police Executive Research Forum, an
organization of top law enforcement officials from some of the largest
departments and agencies in the country. The forum has been sounding the alarm
for some time about the spike in violent crime, and correctly noted early on
that the trend was not uniform.

''Some cities are showing dramatic increases and some are showing dramatic
decreases,'' said Chuck Wexler, the forum's executive director. ''We're almost
like epidemiologists. We're trying to figure out why.''

Gangs and guns are huge problems. So are armed juveniles who have exhibited a
startling willingness to kill over virtually any slight, or during street-corner
holdups in which electronic devices like iPods and cellphones are prized items.

Some cities are suffering from a shortage of police officers (they're expensive)
and the withdrawal of federal support for anti-crime initiatives.

As crime increases, police officers become more engaged, which means they become
more vulnerable. So far this year, 138 police officers have died in the line of
duty, a 38 percent increase over the same period in 2006.

In the old days, the knee-jerk police reaction to a spike in crime was to
respond with gratuitous (often murderous) violence. Los Angeles was a
particularly brutal venue, and the brutality there yielded some particularly
horrendous results.

L.A. is now in the early stages of a potentially historic decline in crime. Some
of the police tactics are counterintuitive, if not heretical, from the
perspective of the old-timers.

Earl Paysinger is Bill Bratton's deputy in L.A. He told the gathering in Chicago
that the decline in crime in his city was due in part to the department's
efforts to ''reach out to communities that years ago we didn't even talk to.''
One of the payoffs, he said, is that now ''people are more willing to call the
police.''

Sometimes the right thing to do is also the most effective.

City still No. 1 in crime, but turnabout is on

BYLINE: By Jeremy Kohler and Bill Bryan ST. LOUIS POST-DISPATCH

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A1

LENGTH: 667 words

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS


New FBI statistics put St. Louis worst in the nation for major crimes per
resident in 2006, but this year is seeing a dramatic turnaround, according to
Police Department figures.

In fact, last month was the safest August since 1990, officials said. Every
month so far in 2007 shows a big drop in crime from the same month of the year
before.

Deputy Police Chief Stephen Pollihan credited the 50-member undercover Crime
Suppression Unit, formed this year to fight street crime and target specific
repeat offenders.

Pollihan said the number of arrests and recoveries of stolen weapons and
vehicles by the unit "has really exceeded our expectations."

He discussed the promising figures with a reporter days before Monday's release
of the FBI's annual city-by-city index of crime statistics, which will bring
renewed attention to the city's poor results for 2006.

Crime increased 6 percent last year - and that was above the 2005 totals on
which the Kansas publishing firm Morgan Quitno based its widely publicized pick
of St. Louis as the nation's "most dangerous" city.

But even in the bad 2006 numbers, there might be some reason for St. Louisans to
find cheer. According to a Post-Dispatch analysis, St. Louis would not repeat as
most dangerous city in the annual Morgan Quitno report, due this fall, if the
publisher uses the same methodology as in several years.

In a photo finish, Detroit would edge out St. Louis. Flint, Mich., Oakland,
Calif., and Camden, N.J., would round out the top five.

The order of finish had much to do with Detroit's population loss. If some 6,000
residents had stuck it out instead of leaving the Michigan metropolis, they
would have diluted its crime rate enough to make St. Louis repeat as dubious
champion.

Scott Morgan, the Morgan Quitno president, said he did not know whether he would
use the same formula this year. His company was bought by CQ Press, the
publishing arm of Congressional Quarterly in Washington.

Crime experts routinely criticize Morgan Quitno's methodology, saying it's
meaningless and unfair to compare cities' crime rates against one another.

This year, the FBI joined in the criticism by superimposing a screen on its
website warning about "simplistic and/or incomplete analyses that often create
misleading perceptions adversely affecting communities and their residents."

Valid comparisons are possible only with careful study and consideration of
unique factors in each city, the warning continued.

In that spirit, criminologists from the University of Missouri-St. Louis had
planned a comparison of metropolitan areas - one in which the St. Louis area
typically finishes on the safe side. But a glitch with FBI data on Monday
delayed their study.

Per capita, St. Louis still had the highest crime rate of the 390 biggest U.S.
cities in 2006, with second place not even close.

St. Louis made its 2006 numbers public months ago, but Monday marked
availability of all major cities' numbers in one report.

The FBI tabulations include eight crime categories - murder, rape, robbery,
aggravated assault, burglary, theft, car theft and arson.

In St. Louis, those were down 14 percent in the first eight months of 2007
versus the same period last year, the Police Department said.

August saw a 31 percent decrease in reported crime compared with August 2006,
and the lowest crime total for any August in 17 years.

Nationally, violent crime - murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault - rose
nearly 2 percent last year. The number of big-city murders also increased, by
1.8 percent, the same rate as homicides nationwide.

Robberies and arson also rose in large population centers, but the number of
rapes and car thefts dropped, FBI data show.

Robberies spiked nationally to their highest levels since 1999, a sign that drug
markets could be expanding, said Richard Rosenfeld, an UMSL criminology
professor.

BLAIR'S ELITE SQUAD TO BEAT THE CRIME LORDS

SECTION: News; Politics; Others; Pg. 7

LENGTH: 550 words


A New British FBI will track down the "untouchable" crime barons behind an
explosion in drug trafficking and people smuggling, Tony Blair claimed
yesterday.  The elite organisation will be based on the famous US Federal Bureau
of Investigation as part of the biggest policing shake-up in decades.

And US police chief Bill Bratton - who spearheaded New York's successful zero
tolerance policy in the 1990s - is tipped to head the new agency after fighting
crime in three of America's biggest cities - Boston, New York and Los Angeles.

The Prime Minister announced the new super-agency during a visit to London's
Docklands, home of much of the hi-tech white collar fraud and money laundering
it will also be tackling.

The Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) will aim to track down the Mr Bigs who
are able to outwit the current patchwork of law enforcement teams, and will have
more than 5,000 investigators, and back-up from computer experts and specialist
prosecutors - including barristers trained to take on crime lords.

Mr Blair hinted that the burden of proof in organised crime cases may need to be
reduced so it is easier for police to secure convictions.

The PM - who is himself a barrister - said: "The system is struggling against a
presumption that you treat these crimes like every other type of crime and that
you build up cases beyond reasonable doubt." Criminals who are obviously living
beyond their means, in huge mansions with expensive cars parked in the drive,
will be required to explain how they gained their cash, he said - adding that
evidence gained from tapping telephones should also be used in courts.

SOCA will replace the National Crime Squad, the National Criminal Intelligence
Service and the investigative arms of Customs and Excise and the immigration
service.

President of the Association of Chief Police Officers Chris Fox welcomed the
agency, but said it was vital it remained in close contact with local policing.

Shadow home secretary David Davis welcomed the plan but warned: "This Government
has a history of announcing headline-grabbing initiatives and not seeing them
through properly." Big business - what SOCA is up against Organised crime groups
exist to make money and are run by ruthless individuals who use extreme
violence, intimidation and corruption, sophisticated counter surveillance
techniques and elaborate money laundering schemes.

The most profitable and harmful crimes controlled by these groups are drugs
trafficking and people smuggling.

The economic and social costs of organised crime are £40billion per year -
equivalent to the GDP of New Zealand.

UK crack cocaine and heroin markets are estimated to be worth £3billion a year.

Problem users of crack cocaine and heroin need to generate an illegal income of
as much as £25,000 a year to pay for their habits, and 280,000 problem drug
users cause about half of all crime.

Every £1 spent on heroin is estimated to generate about £4 of economic and
social cost.

Global profits from people smuggling are £6billion a year.

70 per cent of illegal migrants are smuggled in by organised crime groups.

500,000 illegal migrants enter the EU every year.

People smugglers charge a fee of about £11,000 per person.

Feds say 17 leaders of Detroit underworld indicted and arrested

BYLINE: Kevin Johnson

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 2A

LENGTH: 607 words


Reputed top figures in Detroit's underworld, one of the country's
most enduring crime organizations, were named in a sweeping federal
indictment Thursday linking them to a 30-year trail of extortion,
racketeering, illegal gaming and violence.

For federal authorities, the most celebrated of the 17 suspects
netted was suspected Detroit Cosa Nostra boss Jack William Tocco,
69.

Tocco and three of his captains were roused from their vacation
homes in West Palm Beach, Fla., and nabbed about 6:30 a.m.

Attorney General Janet Reno said Tocco is among the USA's most
powerful mafia figures.


She said his operation at one time infiltrated Las Vegas casinos,
plotted murder and the corruption of public officials.

Reno said the Detroit indictments mark another major strike
against organized crime in the past 12 months. During that time
Boston, New Orleans, Chicago, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Newark and
New York City crime bosses have been convicted or indicted.

"In the last three years, 42 top figures in the La Cosa Nostra,
including seven bosses or underbosses, have been convicted," Reno
said.

But a top FBI official said mob activities remain the "most
significant organized crime threat in the U.S."

"We don't want to say it shut it down," Rick Mosquera, director
of the FBI's organized crime unit, said of the investigation. "We've
taken out the whole hierarchy, and that's what the significance of
this particular investigation is."

By late Thursday, all 17 defendants named in the 25-count
indictment had been captured, including "capos" Anthony Joseph
Zerilli, 68, Tony Giacalone, 77, Anthony Joseph Tocco and Anthony
Joseph Corrado, 60. All were expected to be released on bond.
Mosquera said Jack Tocco and his Detroit associates spent a lifetime
in the business of crime. And when their interests were threatened,
they resorted to the familiar mafia tactics of muscle and
intimidation.

According to the indictment, the Detroit "family" members made
careers of squeezing money as "protection insurance" from small-time
bookmakers, numbers operators and business owners.

For example, when Jesus Morales, identified in the indictment as
an illegal lottery operator, rebuffed the family's reported
extortion attempts, "the defendants . . . did plan to murder" him.

None of charges involved actual killings, but the defendants are
charged with participating in an array of violent activities.

One of them involved Detroit businessman Carlo John Catenacci,
who officials say was the target of the crime family in connection
with an reported extortion try.

A man identified in the indictment as Frank Bert Whitcher
supposedly was hired to "physically assault and beat" Catenacci.

"(Whitcher) could inflict as much harm to Catenacci as he wished,
so long as Catenacci was not killed," the indictment stated.

In another instance, the defendants are accused of constructing
and detonating a makeshift bomb to force a local lottery operator,
Ramzi Yaldoo, to pay them.

As part of more far-flung interests, the Detroit organization
once acquired or tried to acquire secret interests in Nevada casinos
as far back as the 1960s, Mosquera said.

The casinos named in the indictment were the Aladdin Hotel and
Casino and the Frontier Hotel, both in Las Vegas, and the Edgewater
Hotel and Casino in Laughlin. It is not believed that the Detroit
mob has current ties to casino interests in Nevada.

Mosquera said the feds are going to try to keep up the pressure
so that the Detroit mob doesn't "have an opportunity to rejuvenate
(itself)."

What do you think should be done to curb the growing crime rate?

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 14A

LENGTH: 358 words


K.C. Pang, 36
Market researcher
Goshen, N.Y.

There's a lot of talk but no action on crime. It seems as though talk about
fighting crime is heard more often around election time. The issue has become
too political. Laws aren't tough enough. It's time we got tough with the
criminals. They have been getting VIP treatment in the jails for too long.

Crystal Sare, 23
College student
Oklahoma City, Okla.

Longer jail sentences and stiffer penalties would do no good. Criminals don't
worry how much time they would get during the crime. We have to find better ways
to ease them back into society after imprisonment. Rehabilitation is very
important. There's also a lot of crime on college campuses.

Pamela Jackson, 30
Communications supv.
Omaha, Neb.

There's no clear way of fighting crime. Hiring more police won't help if they're
not in the right place at the right time. Education is the key. We have to teach
people how to protect themselves and how to be aware of their surroundings while
on the streets. We also have to learn to respect others.

Dick Thornburgh, 58
U.S. attorney general
Washington, D.C.

The most effective way to reduce violent crime is to get criminals off the
streets. That's the underlying principle of the president's crime-control
proposal. Protecting the public requires holding criminals accountable for their
actions, with swift apprehension, prosecution and incarceration.

Bonnie Small, 37
Department manager
Lawndale, Calif.
We need to have stiffer penalties for criminals. Prison crowding prohibits
long-term incarceration. We need to tighten up the laws. Sometimes, the
punishment doesn't always fit the crime. Criminals get out of jail too quickly.
Sometimes, the legal process allows the criminals to walk away unpunished.

Jack L. Rafalski, 66
Artist
Russellville, Ark.

There are lots of things that can be done to fight crime. There needs to be more
attention to teaching kids what's right and what's wrong. We need to get people
jobs and pay law enforcement people better. Law enforcement officers and
communities must work closely together. Overall, education is the key.

Counting the many ways crime pays

BYLINE: Dave Stancliff/For The Times-Standard

SECTION: OPINION

LENGTH: 771 words


Let's get rid of that silly, hackneyed phrase, "crime doesn't pay." It's not
true.

I'm not sure if it ever was, but if it was, it must have been a long time ago in
a long-forgotten land.

Today, being notorious for committing a crime means people will offer money in
the form of book deals, interviews and movies. Maybe even a reality show for
someone the public thinks got away with murder, like Casey Anthony.

As odd as it sounds, crime is the basis of a legitimate industry that brings in
billions of tourist dollars every year. True crime travel destinations vie with
Caribbean cruises and trips to Disneyland.

In Boston, where reputed crime boss and 16-year fugitive James "Whitey" Bulger
is back in federal custody, tourists find mob-related tours an "offer they can't
refuse."

"We're definitely seeing more interest in our tours," said David Aspro, who
leads the Boston TV & Movie Sites Tour for New York-based On Location Tours.

"We've sold out both the tours we've done since he was captured, and I think
we're on pace to do that again this upcoming weekend," he told The Associated
Press.

The tour takes visitors to different locations ranging from Louisburg Square,
the Beacon Hill park seen in "The Boston Strangler," to the flower
shop/headquarters of gang boss Fergus Colm (Pete Postelthwaite) in "The Town."

Not your cup of tea? Try a trip to "Sin City's" Mob Experience Museum where
criminal memorabilia from Nevada gangsters like Bugsy Seigel and Meyer Lansky is
on display. They also have a new interactive exhibit that takes visitors on a
one-of-a-kind journey into Las Vegas' crime-riddled past. Amid extravagant
realistic settings, the visitor becomes part of the exhibit. They're given a
name and a character of their choice to lead them on the historic virtual tour.

Not interested in going to Las Vegas? No problem. Try the "Weird Chicago" tour.
You get to see the ghosts, gangsters, and the ghouls of the Windy City.

Join Weird Chicago for a walk on the dark side of the city during this grisly
and chilling tour. This is not an ordinary crime tour but a look at the most
depraved murders in the city's history -- and some of the darkest crimes ever
committed. It's a trip back in time to revisit some of the bloodiest crimes of
Chicago's past.

The tour includes death sites, crime scenes and haunts of Chicago's most
notorious killers. Coming up soon: the Dillinger Death Anniversary Weekend on
July 22 and 23.

We must not forget Washington, D.C., and the National Museum of Crime &
Punishment. If you're a serious crime fan, be prepared to roam three floors --
totaling 25,000 square feet -- and featuring over 100 interactive exhibits.

This tour is a "Must See for CSI fans," according to the Today Show. They now
offer a history of the Casey Anthony case, along with the disappearance of
Natalee Holloway, the controversial O.J. Simpson case (once considered the crime
of the century) and an exhibit on the "Freeway Sniper."

Fans of crime dramas like CSI are offered a new tour in Los Angeles that will
surely appeal to their investigatory instincts. "Crime Scene Tours" will allow
visitors to explore some of the city's most famous crime scenes. Organized by
Starline Tours, the operator claims the tour will be "perfect for amateur
sleuths and drama junkies who enjoy television's most popular crime shows,"
according to a recent Los Angeles Times article.

At each stop, tourists will hear a re-telling of the infamous crime that
occurred there. Crime scenes include the North Hollywood bank robbery, which
resulted in a spectacular shoot-out between the robbers and the LAPD.

Also covered is the Black Dahlia murder -- the crime scene and circumstances
surrounding the murder of 22-year-old waitress Elizabeth Short, dubbed the
"Black Dahlia" by the press.

Without a doubt, crime pays. I've offered some examples, and there are plenty
more out there if you want to add to this list. I make no moral judgment about
those who follow crime stories, serial killers, etc. Heck, I have to count
myself in that group.

No. I simply point out that crime does pay. Every day. Still, the irony of
rewarding the bad men and women in our society and those who seek to profit from
their crimes makes me uneasy. I realize I'm complicit when I buy a book like
"The Green River Killer" or "In Cold Blood."

As It Stands, the answer is to not buy, read, or listen to any true stories
about killers in our society. Not a likely scenario for most of us.

Auto thefts help drive 4.7% jump in EP crime

BYLINE: By Daniel Borunda / El Paso Times

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 441 words


El Paso saw the biggest percentage increase in crime among Texas' large cities
last year, according to data released Wednesday by the Texas Department of
Public Safety.

The 4.7 percent rise in El Paso came even as the crime rate dipped 5.3 percent
statewide, the yearly uniform crime report stated. El Paso had the biggest
increase among cities with more than 100,000 people.

The increase was fueled in part by a jump in auto thefts, which rose by more
than 900 vehicles compared with 2005. El Paso also saw increases in rape,
robbery, burglary and theft.

The report showed that murder totals remained unchanged, and aggravated assaults
dropped.

El Paso had 13 homicides last year -- remarkably low even when compared with
smaller cities such as Lubbock (13 homicides), Corpus Christi (21) and Laredo
(22).

El Paso police Wednesday evening did not return calls for comment. Wednesday,
Police Chief Richard Wiles was scheduled to be in Austin for interviews as one
of five finalists for police chief in the capital city. Austin had an 0.4
percent drop in crime in 2006.

Of all cities in the report, the Dallas suburb of Frisco had the biggest jump --
25 percent -- which police there attributed to property crimes in a fast-growing
area, the Associated Press reported.

Dallas, San Antonio and Fort Worth saw drops, while crime increased less than 1
percent in Houston.

The resurgence in auto thefts in El Paso, investigators have said, is due to
organized theft rings in Mexico with ties to drug traffickers. Full-size trucks
are the most frequent targets.

In March, El Paso and Juárez police announced a partnership to share information
on stolen cars, gang members and sex offenders who could be traveling back and
forth across the border.

As part of the effort, Juárez police recently started conducting checks near the
international bridges of traffic entering that city. The operation received some
criticism from Juárez businesses, which claimed it could hurt tourism.

But Juárez Mayor Hector Murguia countered that the checks were already
disrupting criminal activity.

Murguia, in a news release Tuesday, said that 17 vehicles stolen in the United
States had been recovered and that the number of people crossing the border for
"sex tourism" or to buy drugs has diminished.

EP is third-safest again;
Police share credit with residents

BYLINE: By Ramon Bracamontes

SECTION: A SECTION; Pg. 1A

LENGTH: 555 words


El Paso Times

El Paso is one of the three safest large cities in the country, according to
preliminary FBI data released Tuesday. Only New York and San Jose are safer.

"This is a tribute to the mentality of everyone in El Paso," said El Paso police
Officer Linda Olvera, a crime prevention officer who works with neighborhoods in
the Mission Valley.

The ranking is based on the results of the FBI's Uniform Crime Report. The
ranking is based on six categories in 2004 -- murder, rape, robbery, aggravated
assault, burglary and auto theft. El Paso has been one of the three safest large
cities in the nation since 1997, according to the FBI data.

"If you commit a crime here, you will be held accountable," Olvera said. "While
the police officers are doing a good job, we have a lot of help from citizens.
How do you think we find stash houses? It's the neighbors who help."

Among those helping is Estella O. Flores, who works at Valley View Middle School
and is also a member of several crime watch programs and several police advisory
boards.

"We've been working hand in hand with the police for years," Flores said. "We
all have to help."

And the help comes from more than just neighborhood crime watch programs and
neighborhood associations.

In the 5700 block of Dyer, the community policing comes from the small-business
owners in the area, said Blanca Arevalo, a small-business owner in Northeast El
Paso. Though these business owners are not an official association or a
registered neighborhood group, they work together.

"I once left for the night and didn't lock the door," she said from her
family-owned New Lone Star Cleaners. "The business owner next door saw it open
and called me late at night, and I came back to lock up. It's safe here; it is
basically safe everywhere."

Several hundred people walk into her cleaners every day, and rarely does she
feel threatened.

"Everyone knows who the troublemakers are, and we all watch out for them,"
Arevalo said. "We had to call the police once, and they responded with arrests."

Marge Bartoletti, director of the Rio Grande Safe Communities Coalition, said
the Police Department deserves a lot of the credit for the low crime rate.

"They are sensitive to what the people are saying, and they do react," said
Bartoletti, whose coalition works to combat alcohol and drug abuse. "Everyone
works together in this city."

Though the reasons for the low crime ranking seem simple, they aren't, said S.
Fernando Rodriguez, a homicide researcher at the University of Texas at El Paso.

"The answer is a bit more complex," he said. "I'm not saying that the
Neighborhood Watch groups don't help, but the answer is something that has yet
to be found."

Rodriguez is applying for a national grant that would allow UTEP to thoroughly
study El Paso's crime rate and compare the city with other similar cities. Crime
is supposed to be high in cities with low incomes, high unemployment and a young
population. El Paso is a leader in those three categories, yet violent crime is
low, he said.

"Look at the median age of this city," Rodriguez said. "Based on that, El Paso
crime rates are supposed to be going up. We are turning things around."

For the past 10 years, El Paso averaged 20 murders. In 2004 there were 11
murders, and so far in 2005 there have been nine.

New York City keeps getting safer 13% 6-month drop in serious crime rate exceeds
expectations

BYLINE: Rick Hampson

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 622 words

DATELINE: NEW YORK


NEW YORK -- Experts who said that crime here wouldn't maintain
its rate of decline were proved right Tuesday: Crime fell even
faster in the past six months.

Preliminary police statistics out Tuesday say serious crime dropped
13% in the city in the first half of 1997, compared with 11% in
the first six months of 1996.

Homicides in 1996 were down 30%; rape declined 10%; robbery fell
17%; burglary 15%; and automobile theft 17%.


A city that once epitomized urban lawlessness is now safer than
San Diego and the 23 other largest U.S. cities. It is safer than
Albany, N.Y., or Anchorage, Alaska, and en route to its fourth
straight double-digit drop in the crime rate.

Yet crime is still the talk of the town.

New Yorkers have been shocked by the torture, murder and robbery
of the son of Time Warner Chairman and CEO Gerald Levin; by the
case of two teens accused of stabbing a real estate agent to death
during a night of drinking in Central Park; and by the murder
of a policeman, allegedly by a stockbroker caught burglarizing
his father's apartment.

"I don't care about statistics," says Joseph Younger, a 59-year-old
electrician who sipped his morning coffee and discussed the crime
figures. "You read about that kind of stuff and it makes you
wonder."

The city can live with such worries, argues Thomas Reppetto, director
of the Citizens Crime Commission.

"Even in the '50s, individual crimes were big stories. But it
was something people read about," Reppetto says. "By the '80s,
it was happening in their lives."

The real news, he adds, is what New York has done to reduce crime.

Although no one is sure exactly why crime has dropped so far so
fast, Reppetto and other experts say police have helped reduce
crime by:

-- Cracking down on the minor but irritating crimes that made
life here uniquely unpleasant.

It is now harder to panhandle, urinate, bicycle or drink beer
on the sidewalks of New York. The theory: If you don't stop such
small-time offenders, the really bad guys are emboldened.

-- Strictly enforcing firearms laws. Many drug dealers aren't
carrying guns. "There are cases of guys going for their gun,
forgetting they've left them at home," Reppetto says.

-- Focusing on "hot zones," a few neighborhoods with a lot
of crime. For example, police have stationed officers outside
social clubs where murders repeatedly occurred.

"The strategies we put in place are working," Mayor Rudy Giuliani
said on Tuesday. The Republican mayor is seeking re-election in
one of the nation's most Democratic cities. "This far exceeds
any decrease that we've had before."

Nationally, serious crime declined 3% last year.

Even in New York's most impoverished neighborhoods, where murder
rates remain two or three times the national average, people say
they don't hear gunfire as often at bedtime. And they don't attend
as many children's funerals.

"I never thought I'd see the day," says Loretta McVeigh, who
has lived for 20 years in a public housing project in Brooklyn.
"But the kids who were making the trouble have calmed down."


Fewer victims

Preliminary New York City police statistics out Tuesday say serious
crime dropped 13% in the city in the first half of 1997, compared
with a drop of 11% in the first six months of 1996. A comparison
of crimes:

Crime                1996     1997
Homicides           529        371
Rape              1,494      1,341
Robbery          25,143     20,988

NORTH CAROLINA: North Carolina's crime rate rose at three times the national
rate in 1991, leaving Charlotte nearly tied with New York City in per capita
violent crime, state law enforcement officials said Monday.

North Carolina's crime rate rose 9 percent from 1990, compared with the national
increase of 3 percent, said Charles Dunn, the director of the State Bureau of
Investigation. Charlotte ranks 25th among U.S. cities with 2,213 violent crimes
per 100,000 population, compared with 750 nationally and 2,327 for New York,
which ranks 23rd.

"We spent megabucks on bricks and mortar in the inner city to make it nice for
the upper echelons," said City Council member Ella Scarborough. "Now the people
we forgot about are terrorizing us and making it unsafe to go into the buildings
we built."

FLORIDA: Expelled students sue schools. More than two-thirds of the 743 students
tossed out of Florida schools last year were expelled in Orange County. Now,
attorneys for 280 expelled students have filed a class-action lawsuit in
Orlando, which is in Orange County, seeking to force the district to evaluate
all students who might have mental or emotional problems before expelling them
for disciplinary reasons. If the lawsuit is successful, the district may have to
educate emotionally or mentally troubled kids instead of kicking them out for
misbehavior, said a lawyer for Greater Orlando Area Legal Services.

ALABAMA: Taxpayers get bill for office furniture. Alabama's welfare commissioner
billed taxpayers $ 4,715 for two wing chairs, a sofa and a cocktail table last
month while his department was struggling with 5 percent budget cutbacks,
reports said Monday. The items were for Commissioner Charles Cleveland's office.
He said part of the purchase was to replace furniture picked by his predecessor.
"I didn't like the English tea room table; it wasn't functional," said Mr.
Cleveland. "There was a sofa in here before; it just simply was not appropriate
for this office."

FLORIDA: Leak shuts down nuclear reactor. A radioactive water leak from a
primary cooling pump shut down one of Turkey Point's two nuclear reactors near
Miami on Monday, a utility spokesman said. No one was contaminated in the
incident, which was reported to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said Mel
Klein, spokesman for Florida Power & Light Co. The leak occurred in Unit 3,
which went back on line late last year after 11 months of safety upgrades.
Turkey Point's Unit 4 reactor remains operating.

MISSISSIPPI: Tests to find bad water planned. Organizers of Mississippi's
Groundwater Education and Well Water Testing Project hope to test 1,000 private,
domestic drinking water supplies in the state by May 4 as a means to increase
the public's awareness of possible dangers to water supplies. Jack Carroll,
coordinator of Mississippi's Cooperative Extension Service, said the program
provides a free test kit for anyone wanting to ensure safe water supplies. If
any contamination is found, further testing will be performed so recommendations
can be made to the owners, he said.

TENNESSEE: Condemned killer loses two appeals. Tennessee death row inmate
William Groseclose, convicted in 1978 of hiring a hit man to murder his wife,
lost two appeals Monday in the U.S. Supreme Court. The justices, without
comment, rejected arguments that Groseclose was denied a fair trial and that his
appeals have been hampered unlawfully by the state's failure to provide a
complete and accurate trial transcript. Groseclose, a former Navy recruiter, was
convicted by a Shelby County trial of hiring Ronald Eugene Rickman to murder
Deborah Lee Groseclose, whose body was found July 4, 1977.

FLORIDA: Woman gets apology for background check. A credit reporting agency and
the Orlando Utilities Commission have apologized to a Melbourne woman for
conducting an unauthorized investigation of her financial affairs. At a Feb. 13
public meeting, Glenda Busick, 40, urged people in Brevard County to protest
pollution at the utility's Indian River power plant. That resulted in an order
from the commission's safety director, W.E. Earls, to Equifax Inc. of Atlanta
for a credit and background search of Mrs. Busick's records without a court
order or the woman's permission.

Have you been a victim of crime on a college campus? Do you know someone who
has?

If so, we'd like to hear from you as part of USA TODAY's ongoing investigation
of campus crime.

Our 1988 study found:

- 13,000 assaults.

- About 5,000 rapes.

- At least 31 murders.

Now we want to see if these figures are up, down.

New laws requiring colleges to inform students of campus crime rates are gaining
momentum nationwide. These warnings can help prevent more crimes, supporters
say.

''Lives are at stake,'' says Constance Clery of Bethlehem, Pa., whose daughter
Jeanne was murdered in her Lehigh University dorm room in 1986. Clery and
husband Howard have lobbied federal lawmakers for a crime disclosure bill that
has passed the House.

Giuliani Is Quick to Point Out Another Drop in Crime Rate

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

SECTION: Section B; Page 4; Column 5; Metropolitan Desk

LENGTH: 476 words


Crime in New York City continued its six-year decline during 1997, according to
statistics released yesterday by the F.B.I., as the number of crimes reported in
the city fell by 7 percent. Once again, the city's crime reduction outpaced the
statistics for other cities with more than one million residents, which
experienced an overall drop in crime of 5 percent.

And once again, Police Commissioner Howard Safir and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani
were quick to take credit for the success and even quicker to try to insure that
the significance of the statistics would not be understated.

Citing the latest Federal Bureau of Investigation figures, the Mayor said that
on a per capita basis, New York was now safer than any of the 25 largest cities
in the country. Mr. Safir said New York now ranked 160th in crime out of the 201
cities with a population of more than 100,000.

"It's amazing to think that we're now safer than Boise, Idaho," Mr. Safir
proclaimed yesterday at a City Hall news conference.

That assertion raised some eyebrows in Boise (population 153,258), which
reported just four homicides and 7,921 total crimes during 1997, compared with
770 murders and 355,893 crimes in New York City.

"You laugh when you hear Mayor Giuliani's people say New York is safer, because
you know better," said Boise's Mayor, Brent Coles.  "This is a place where
people don't lock their doors at night or their car doors. You can walk all
hours of the night downtown and never feel afraid. I hope New Yorkers can enjoy
the same thing."

The F.B.I.'s Uniform Crime Reporting Program cautions that direct comparisons
between the per capita crime rates of cities can be misleading because they do
not account for social factors such as population density or the legal
definitions of crimes that vary from state to state. Instead, the F.B.I.
recommends that the data should be used to compare the increase or drop in each
city to the national trend.

Even by that more modest standard, the statistics contained encouraging news for
New York City and many other large urban areas.

Crime in New York peaked in 1990, when 2,262 homicides were committed, and that
number has fallen steadily ever since.

The number of homicides in New York dropped by 21 percent during the last year,
from 983 in 1996 to 770 in 1997, a decrease that was more than twice the size of
the 9 percent decline in homicides nationwide.

The number of rapes in New York also dropped by 7.5 percent in 1997, and robbery
fell 10 percent. Nationwide, rape fell by 1 percent and the number of robberies
declined 9 percent.

Newark also enjoyed a sizable drop in reported crime, the F.B.I. said. The
number of homicides dipped by 38 percent last year, from 92 in 1996 to 57 in
1997. The total number of crimes reported decreased nearly 18 percent, from
34,431 in 1996 to 28,351 in 1997.

Report views cost of violent crime;
Says Jacksonville could save millions, cut taxes by reducing levels 25 percent

BYLINE: Matt Dixon

SECTION: Pg. B-3

LENGTH: 390 words


A Washington, D.C., think tank says it knows where Jacksonville can find
millions in budget savings: reduce violent crime.

The Center for American Progress released a report Tuesday that looks at the
impact major crime has on the economies in eight cities, including Jacksonville.

The report considers the impact of murder, rape, assault and robbery, which
nationally cost cities $42 billion annually, the report found.

"A 25 percent reduction in these violent crimes would generate an estimated
$11.1 million in city budget savings," the report read.

That level of reduction would allow Jacksonville to reduce property taxes by up
to 2 percent or increase spending on economic development by 26 percent.
Jacksonville has a roughly $1 billion annual budget.

The report was compiled by Democratic economist Robert Shapiro, who worked in
Bill Clinton's White House, and Republican economist Kevin Hassett, who served
as an economic adviser to the GOP presidential campaigns of John McCain and
George W. Bush.

Beyond city budgeting, they estimate that violent crimes cost Jacksonville $200
million annually through both direct and indirect costs.

"Violent crimes also impose large costs on communities through lower property
values, higher insurance premiums, and reduced investment in high-crime areas,"
the report read.

It estimates that a 10 percent reduction in homicides alone could increase
Jacksonville's residential property values by $600 million.

They said the crime-reduction-as-economic-engine idea should receive support
from both sides of the political spectrum.

"The basic idea is that crime has big negative affect on property values,"
Hassett said. "If you do a cost-benefit analysis, [reducing crime] is going to
have some really good benefits that should attract bi-partisan support."

Duval County has topped Florida's largest counties in homicide rate for all but
one of the past dozen years. In 2011, the county's murder rate was 8.79 per
100,000 residents, which was tops among counties with more than 500,000 people,
according to numbers released by the state in May.

Mayor Alvin Brown's office said he is reviewing the report.

Jacksonville was the second "safest" city looked at by the report's authors,
trailing only Seattle. Other cities included Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Houston,
Milwaukee and Philadelphia.

Bloomberg's gun claim pretty much on target

BYLINE: Eric Stirgus; Staff

SECTION: METRO NEWS; Pg. 1B

LENGTH: 1051 words


New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg recently took aim at the Peach State.

Bloomberg was on CNN several weeks ago to discuss a report that named Georgia
among the states with the weakest gun laws.

"Do the states where they have weaker laws have more crime?" asked CNN's Kiran
Chetry.

"There's no argument about that," Bloomberg replied.

National Rifle Association spokeswoman Rachel Parsons called Bloomberg's claim
"absolutely ridiculous."

"If that were the case, Washington, D.C., Chicago and New York would be some of
the safest cities in our country, and they are simply not," Parsons said. "Yet,
they have some of the strictest gun laws in the country."

The nation's capital had a higher violent crime rate than any of the 50 states
in each of the past three years, according to FBI data. New York was at the
other end of the spectrum, the data showed. The Big Apple had the lowest crime
rate among the nation's 25 largest cities, the FBI data showed.

But Bloomberg answered a question about states, so let's dig into his claim a
little deeper.

The report, "Trace the Guns: The Link Between Gun Laws and Interstate Gun
Trafficking," was put together for a group called Mayors Against Illegal Guns
and completed in September.

Bloomberg, an independent, is co-chair of the coalition. Georgia mayors listed
as coalition members include Atlanta's Kasim Reed, East Point's Earnestine
Pittman, Roswell's Jere Wood and Savannah's Otis Johnson.

Ten states, half of them located in the South, are listed in the report as
having weak gun laws. They are Alabama, Alaska, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky,
Mississippi, Nevada, South Carolina, West Virginia and Virginia.

Bloomberg, a vocal advocate of gun control, filed lawsuits against eight gun
shops in Georgia and in 19 other states in 2006 he argued had relatively lax gun
laws. Most of the cases were settled. Others defaulted, and a couple of cases
were dismissed.

Researchers looked at several topics concerning violence and where the guns came
from that were used in the crimes, using data from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

In each of the past four years, the report found Georgia led the nation in the
number of guns sold here that were used in crimes in other states. Per capita,
Georgia was 10th on the list. The researchers reached that conclusion by
dividing the number of guns sold by 100,000 residents. Mississippi was first.
New York ranked next to last on the list, ahead of Hawaii.

The report contains a checklist of 10 "key gun laws" and which states have
passed those laws and which ones have not to determine which states have weak
gun laws.

The laws include whether a state requires background checks for all handgun
sales at gun shows, if the state prohibits gun possession by violent
misdemeanants and whether the state requires reporting of lost or stolen guns.
Georgia has enacted two of the 10 laws. Georgia requires state inspection of gun
dealers. Gun dealers who don't conduct background checks of prospective gun
owners can go to jail.

Some groups, such as the National Shooting Sports Foundation, have criticized
the findings, saying crime has "plummeted" in states said in the study to have
weaker gun laws.

We reviewed two sets of data to see whether Bloomberg is correct about states
that have weak gun laws still have more crime. One supported his argument; the
other one offered mixed results.

The Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention keeps track of
firearm deaths by state. Eight of the 10 states said to have "weak" gun laws
were in the top half of states with firearm deaths, according to the most recent
CDC figures. The most recent figures, from 2007, were adjusted for population.
The results were similar from 2003 to 2006. Georgia ranked between 14th and 20th
during those five years.

We also looked at the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports, which show violent crime
rates for each state and Washington, D.C. Five of the states said to have "weak"
gun laws were in the top half of states of violent crime in 2009. Georgia ranked
20th. Washington, D.C., was first; its violent crime rate was more than twice
any state on the list. The results were similar in 2008 and 2007. The FBI warns
against using the data to make comparisons, noting they don't take into account
variables that might impact a state's crime rate.

Harvard University's Department of Health Policy and Management tracks firearm
research, frequently does reports on the subject and is considered experts in
this field. We talked to two members of its faculty, Matt Miller and David
Hemenway, about Bloomberg's answer to the question during the CNN interview.
Both men have done studies on similar subjects and believe there is a
correlation between places with more guns and homicide.

"Where there are more guns, there are more deaths and homicides," Miller said.

They said there's less research and data on whether states with weaker gun laws
have more crime or states with more guns have higher crime rates.

"Most crimes don't involve guns," Hemenway said. "If there's causation at all,
it's not clear."

So where does this leave us? The CDC numbers do show states with weaker gun laws
tend to have more firearm deaths. The FBI data shows some of those states had
more violent crime, but others were in the middle of the pack nationally. There
are many types of crime, and not all are committed with firearms. We rate
Bloomberg's statement as a Mostly True.

Crime, punishment should be viewed in a wider context

BYLINE: Paul Walton, The Daily News

SECTION: NEWS; Cats & Monkeys; Pg. A3

LENGTH: 602  words


When it comes to crime, Canadians suffer from what social psychologists might
call "cognitive dissonance."

Say "crime," and we immediately jump to the idea of courts, police and justice.

It's been particularly rife here on the West Coast lately, with gang activity
resulting in a half-dozen murders in the Lower Mainland. And then on Monday came
a study concluding that B.C. judges are not soft on crime. More cognitive
dissonance, in which we hold to one belief though there is ample evidence that
it is wrong.

Here's a classic example.

In the discussion around the gang problem in the Lower Mainland, B.C.'s
solicitor general John van Dongen on a radio call-in show on Monday was
commenting on the idea of dedicating Crown prosecutors to working with police.
To support the idea, van Dongen said that it works in the United States. Right.
Tell that to the police and district attorneys in Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami,
New York and Detroit.

To think of crime only in the context of how to handle it after it happens is
ridiculous. Claims that harsher sentences and more laws will somehow make us
safer are nothing short of fantasy. There may be a need to upgrade, change and
modify sentencing regimes, but that has to fit into a wider context of what
crime is and how it works.

We seem to be under the impression that organized crime and the punks who shoot
each other are just part of our habitat, growing out of a landscape that we are
unable to alter.

Not so. Crime, organized and otherwise, fits into a context. The idea that crime
is related to poverty is not only not true, but an insult to the millions who
have and continue to bear their poverty in honour and honesty.

It's closer to the truth that crime and criminal activity is a microcosm, or the
shadow side, of how society functions. Since we live, breathe and promote
profit, markets and accumulation, that is the motive of the criminal. Crime for
us centres around property and the body.

If we lived in a society that pushed economics to the edges and thrived on
equity, choice and respect, we would consider prejudice, malice and disrespect
as crime. We may prosecute them very differently, but they would still be
crimes, falling in the shadow of those things that we hold as important. Crime
might then centre around actions that harm society as much as our property or
ourselves.

The easy way to look at crime is as anti-social behaviour, but it's not that
simple. Anti-social is defined by what is social, as failure is defined by
success. If we want to tackle crime this is the point we need to acknowledge,
how we create and define what we call crime. If criminals are running around the
streets killing each other over establishing drug markets, we need to look very
carefully not at sentencing but at social milieu in which such criminals exist.

Of greater concern than the criminals has to be a potential excessive response
that threatens our liberty. There is a real possibility that the cognitive
dissonance that prevents us from seeing society's wider role in creating crime
may also play a role in the kind of logic that says if criminals are abusing
freedoms then we must limit freedoms.

In recent years we have widened police powers too greatly out of fear of crime
and terrorism. Fear is a manifestation of ignorance, of believing there is harm
in the unknown.

Fear is the wrong motive at any time. What we need is not even courage, but the
strength to look at ourselves and make difficult choices that will reveal who we
really are.

Mob Leader in North Jersey To Aid in Crime Investigations

BYLINE: By The New York Times

SECTION: Section B; Page 5; Column 5; Metropolitan Desk

LENGTH: 387 words

DATELINE: NEWARK, July 10


The head of a Philadelphia crime family's operations in northern New Jersey
admitted today to conspiring to commit murder, extortion and other activities in
the last three decades and agreed to aid in investigations of the three crime
families, prosecutors said.

Peter Caprio of Union, N.J., the 70-year-old leader of the Bruno family's
so-called North Jersey crew, pleaded guilty in United States District Court here
to a single count of conspiracy dating from the 1970's to last March. The plea
by Mr. Caprio, who is nicknamed the Crum, follows an indictment in March
charging him with the murders of two former associates in the Bruno family,
William Gantz in 1975 and Joseph Sodano in 1996.

"This seriously erodes the prominence of the Bruno crime family in New Jersey,"
Laura J. Kaplan, the assistant Unites States attorney who handled the case, said
of Mr. Caprio's plea. "This is the highest-ranking member of the Bruno crime
family here in North Jersey."

In answer to questions relating to his plea today, prosecutors said Mr. Caprio
also admitted participating with various people in other murders, as well as in
loan sharking, gambling and extortion. In one case, Mr. Caprio admitted that he
ordered a former Bruno family associate, Philip Casale, to kill Mr. Sodano.

Ms. Kaplan said information from Mr. Casale had resulted in Mr. Caprio's
indictment. She said that Mr. Casale was also cooperating with investigators and
that he was awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty to a single count of
conspiracy last fall. Mr. Casale and Mr. Caprio are both in Federal custody.

Also significant, Ms. Kaplan said, is Mr. Caprio's agreement to cooperate in
investigations of organized crime activities by families other than the Bruno
mob. She said Mr. Caprio had already provided information regarding members of
the Genovese and Gambino families, which are based in New York City but have
operations in New Jersey.

Mr. Caprio's lawyer, Jean Barrett, declined to elaborate on the information
provided by her client.

"I don't know exactly what information he's going to provide to the government,
but obviously there is an agreement on file in which he will cooperate," Ms.
Barrett said.

Mr. Caprio faces a maximum sentence of life in prison and a $250,000 fine, with
sentencing set for Oct. 23.

Crime Declines in Baltimore

SECTION: METRO; Pg. D06; CRIME AND JUSTICE

LENGTH: 212 words


Reported crime in Baltimore declined 16 percent during the first three months of
1997, Baltimore police said yesterday, a drop that officials say may be part of
a national trend.

Figures released by the city show a 20 percent drop in reported violent crimes
-- homicide, rape, robbery and aggravated assault -- for the first three months
of this year compared with the same period in 1996, and a 14 percent decline in
reported property crimes. Property crimes include burglary, larceny and auto
theft.

D.C. police also reported late last week an overall 16 percent decline in crime.

In addition, the Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics released
figures this week showing that in the nation as a whole, violent crime fell 12
percent and property crimes 9 percent from 1994 to 1995, the most recent period
for which figures were available.

Officials said it was the steepest decline since the bureau began keeping such
figures in 1973.

Baltimore Police Commissioner Thomas C. Frazier credited his city's crime drop
to the recent transfer of about 300 officers from desk jobs to street duty, an
emphasis on enforcement against gun violence and efforts to improve community
cooperation through a system of citizen block representatives.

Crime stats again puncture border myths

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A4

LENGTH: 500 words


The FBI reported last week that violent crime increased by 4 percent nationally
between 2014 and 2015, driven in large part by increases in gun violence in some
major U.S. cities.

One area that defied this trend, without any real attention, was urban areas
along the U.S.-Mexico border.

Violent crime in U.S. urban areas on the Mexican border declined by 7 percent
between 2014 and 2015, according to an El Paso Times analysis of the FBI data,
which is based on reports provided by local law enforcement agencies across the
country.

This is not a new development. Crime rates in U.S. communities along the Mexican
border have been lower than comparable cities away from the border for many
years. But that fact is usually drowned out by politically driven rhetoric that
paints the border as a war zone.

Violent crime in El Paso, long among the safest of major U.S. cities, declined
by almost 7 percent. In Las Cruces, violent crime dropped by more than 9
percent.

Some may try to tie the drop in crime to the so-called "border surge" started in
2014 after families and children fleeing violence and poverty in Central America
flooded to the Rio Grande Valley in search of safety.

Any such claims would be questionable at best. First, crime in border areas has
been on the decline for many years before the so-called surge. Second, the drop
in violent crime is just as pronounced in places like El Paso, Las Cruces, and
Yuma, Arizona, which did not see an increase in National Guard and Texas
Department of Public Safety troopers in 2015.

The low and declining crime rates along the border have many causes. Research
has shown that immigrants are less likely than native-born Americans to
participate in crime. And the federal government has dramatically increased the
numbers of law enforcement forces it has placed on the border in the past
decade.

That latter fact is often ignored in conservative circles, where it is an
article of faith that the Obama administration has failed to secure the border.
This has been particularly true in Texas, where DPS is proposing another 39
percent increase in funding for border security, even though the agency has
provided no real data showing that its increased spending is having any impact.

While the Republican-dominated state leadership was posturing on border security
during the 2015 legislative session, Dallas-Fort Worth suburbs like Carrolton,
Grapevine and Frisco were undergoing double-digit increases in violent crime. In
Lubbock, violent crime went up 12 percent.

This is not to suggest that the DPS flood troopers into the Metroplex or to
Texas Tech. But the latest national crime statistics are yet another reminder of
how skewed rhetoric can lead to misguided policy. A decision to direct
law-enforcement resources to the border is, by definition, a decision not to
place those resources elsewhere.

The latest crime statistics are yet another reminder that political rhetoric
about the U.S.-Mexico border bears little resemblance to reality.

Seeking reporter for regional take, to be topped by individual sites. Newly
released FBI data show the number of murders in the U.S. rose nearly 11 percent
last year and violent crime increased by nearly 4 percent, but crime researchers

crime wave from 20 years ago. Roxana Kopetman 25"; with local factboxes per site

FULL TEXT

Violent crimes increased in California and across the nation in the past year
but continue to remain well below historic peaks, according to FBI data released
Monday.

Murder increased nearly 11 percent nationwide. In California, it was 9.5
percent, according to data provided by local law enforcement agencies to the
FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting Program, which compiles data on murders,
aggravated assault, car thefts and other crimes.

UC Irvine professor Charis Kubrin, of the department of criminology, law and
society, cautioned that the numbers may look alarming but "there's no evidence
of a national homicide wave."

Instead, crime trends have held steady, she said.

"It is important to remember that at the end of the day, even with this
increase, we are still lower than 30 years ago," Kubrin

said. "In California, if you look at major cities with populations over 400,000,
the state has fared pretty well."

Los Angeles, for example, saw an uptick in 2015 in murders from the year before,
but the rate has remained at seven murders per 100,000 residents. By comparison,
Kubrin noted, the murder rate in Chicago, Milwaukee, Philadelphia and other
cities is much higher.

A study released last week by the Brennan Center for Justice at New York
University School of Law analyzed crime data from the 30 largest cities in 2015
and found that crime overall remained the same as in 2014, but murder had
increased by 14 percent. Three cities - Baltimore, Chicago and Washington, D.C.
- were responsible for half of that increase.

Nationwide, agencies reported a nearly 4 percent increase in the number of
violent crimes and a 2.6 percent decrease in the estimated number of property
crimes for 2015, compared with the previous year.

California's violent and property crime rates increased by about 8 percent each
in 2015 compared with 2014.

"It is not uncommon for crime rates to 'bounce around' a bit, and given that we
remain at historically low levels of crime, I wouldn't be too concerned," George
Tita, a UC Irvine professor of criminology, law and society, said in an email.

In California, the rate per 100,000 people increased to 426.3 from 396.1 for
violent crimes.

In Los Angeles, violent crime increased 31 percent from 2014 to 2015 and
property crimes went up by 12.5 percent during that same period.

Long Beach, meanwhile, also saw a 20 percent increase in its violent crime rate.

In this year's report, FBI Director James Comey said the agency is working
toward developing a database chronicling incidents of police use of force.

Staff writer Joshua Sudock and Jeff Collins contributed to this report.

Violent crime in Chicago drops to lowest level since '72;
Study is proof that city's gruesome reputation is undeserved, leaders say

BYLINE: William Spain

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 425 words


If the grimly regular tally of shootings provides plenty of grist for the local
and national news media, the reality of violence in Chicago may be quite
different -- at least according to a study about to be released.

Crime in the city of Al Capone and John Gacy has dipped to a 40-year low, said
Andrew Papachristos, a criminologist and associate professor at Yale University
who conducted the research. Chicago officials aren't missing their chance to
seize on the data and tout the improvement.

This year alone, "Chicago appears to be on track to have both the lowest violent
crime rate since 1972, and lowest homicide rate since 1967," he said.

The report, titled 48 Years of Crime in Chicago, examines the crime trends in
the city. Papachristos noted that while Chicago has long been thought of as a
bastion for criminals, it in fact ranks 19th in violent crime rates among large
cities, on par with Houston and Minneapolis and below places like Detroit and
St. Louis.

Even in New Haven, Conn., where Yale is located, "the rate is higher than
Chicago," he said.

The Chicago Police Department reports that there were 483 murders in 2012, a
number that has dropped to 392 so far this year. Overall crime is down 16%.

City leaders see the study as proof that Chicago's gruesome reputation is
undeserved and that stepped-up law enforcement and social services efforts are
working.

"We have more work to do," Mayor Rahm Emanuel told USA TODAY. But "it does show
that the things we are trying ... are having an impact."

The crime dips have been uneven, and some affluent areas -- the largest
beneficiaries of recent development -- are seeing the biggest fall-offs. Still,
the overall trend generally has been citywide.

"More and more mothers, more and more neighborhoods can now enjoy a sense of
normalcy," Emanuel said.

Emanuel is pushing what he calls the "Four Ps": policing, prevention, parenting
and penalties.

Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy said that while Chicago has the fourth most
police per capita of the largest cities -- behind Washington, Baltimore and
Newark -- law enforcement is just part of the solution. "We are backing
(policing) with social programs and things that will have a longer-term effect,"
he said. "We are not just trying to put a Band-Aid on the problem."

The numbers are of little comfort to some in tougher regions. Donna Johnson,
whose family has lived in the Roseland neighborhood for 44 years, said: "As kids
in the 1960s and 1970s, we felt very safe running around. As adults, we don't
even walk to the store after dark."

Talk about Amtrak pollution

Let's talk about air pollution. Yes! Let's talk about it. But so far, I haven't
heard anyone talk about the pollution caused by trains at the Amtrak station at
Jack London Square, which is supposedly becoming the "in" place. Well, it's not.
Trains come and go all day long (and night too), some 50 of them   that is not
counting merchandise trains. It never stops. Quite a number of those trains will
stop at the station for close to 40 minutes while purging their engines. You
should see the black, thick dust around here. Impressive. And that ends up in
the air you breathe.

But anyway: Isn't this California, in the 21st century?

Where else do you have train tracks running through a city but in a Third World
country?

Stop funding parolees in Oakland

Voters approved Measure Y to curb crime in Oakland. However, Measure Y also
funds services for the large number of parolees who are released to Oakland
every year. The city estimates that 3,000 are returned to the area annually. In
fact, Alameda County, site of Oakland, received nearly 50 percent more new
parolees per capita than Los Angeles County in 2005, according to the Los
Angeles Times.

Oakland, the state's eighth-largest city, is home to a large population of
parolees, who account for approximately 50 percent of the crimes committed
there.

"You certainly see folks who are either on probation or coming out of prison on
parole at great risk of committing violent crimes or being victims of violent
crime," said Lenore Anderson, the city's safety director.

It's not surprising that Oakland had the highest rate of violent crime of any
large city in California last year   190.5 incidents for every 10,000 people,
according to a Times analysis of recently released FBI data. That's nearly 2 1/2
times the rate in Los Angeles.

There were 1,066 more rapes, robberies, murders and aggravated assaults in
Oakland last year than in San Francisco, which has nearly twice the population.

Oakland's violent crime rate jumped 34.1 percent between 2005 and 2006 and 38
percent between 2003 and 2006.

We need to challenge the disproportionate number of parolees allowed to be
released in Oakland if we are going to curb crime.

Shame on sports teams using Indians

It is a crying shame that sports teams still have American Indians as either
mascots or logos. Whether it is the professional teams of the Atlanta Braves,
Cleveland Indians, Washington Redskins or the collegiate teams of the Florida
State Seminoles, Utah Utes and San Diego Aztecs, they make American Indians less
than human beings.

Non-Indians who don't see a problem with it show their racist ignorance about
American Indians by saying that there are other things that need to be worried
about. For the sake of treating them as human beings, both the names and logos
must be changed.

Afghanistan is a NATO mission

During his brief stop in Afghanistan, Barack Obama declared the situation
"urgent" and "the centerpiece in the war on terror."

Obama now proposes immediately to send an additional 10,000 U.S. troops (two
brigades) to the country.

Yet in May 2007, Obama had a totally different Afghan policy prescription. Obama
was among just 14 senators voting to cut off all funds for military activity in
both Iraq and Afghanistan. At that time, Obama was posturing himself as the
champion of the anti-war left.

Afghanistan is a NATO mission. Obama, chairman of the Senate subcommittee on
European and NATO affairs, never previously visited Afghanistan and has never
bothered to hold a single hearing of his subcommittee with legislative oversight
responsibility for the country.

Rather than making dramatic policy shifts on Afghanistan based on politics,
Obama might hold his very first Senate subcommittee hearing. The purpose should
be to develop a carefully considered Afghan policy within the NATO framework.

Action against global warming

Right now, California is spearheading our country's fight against global
warming.

Two years ago, Gov. Schwarzenegger committed to cutting global warming pollution
and now he must follow through.

If he is serious about revolutionizing energy in this state, it is critical that
he makes polluters pay for every ton of pollution so that we can start investing
in clean energy now. With the resources to make renewable energy at our
fingertips, and big polluters such as ExxonMobil making more than $40 billion in
profits in one year, there is no reason to hesitate.

The people of California are ready to take action against global warming
pollution. It is time for the governor to prove to us that he is the leader who
will take action and stand up to big polluters.

Happy green planet means we will be happy

According to recently published research, happiness is based more on these two
factors   helping others and participating in something larger than oneself
than seeking positive emotion.

Citing The World Values Survey (www.worldvaluessurvey.org) and Happy Planet
Index (www.happyplanetindex.org), the research reveals that beyond a certain
point, people who value material good and wealth are treading more heavily on
the earth while not getting happier.

It turns out that being environmentally conscious   recycling, conserving and
implementing sustainable practices   also makes us happier than valuing wealth,
power and fame.

Engagement with community and family, fostering strong social institutions, and
seeking adventure and meaning are all linked to well-being.

With only 5 percent of the world's population, North America accounts for 22
percent of the human footprint, while Africa, with 13 percent of the population,
accounts for 7 percent of the footprint.

The United States is 16th on the happiness index, a ranking that has been flat
for the last 25 years.

All that stuff? We're not getting happier. In fact, aspiring for a lot of
material goods is unhappiness-producing, while contributing to ecological
destruction.

Not too surprising then that as we seek to enrich our lives with the
intangibles, such as beauty, goodness, justice and love while pursuing a lighter
impact on earth's resources, we'll find a happiness that is worth pursuing, for
ourselves and the planet.

Businesses are outsourcing calls

A recent column I read about businesses outsourcing their work really hit the
mark.

When I am not reaching customer service in another county, such as the
Philippines, I am trying to find my way through a maze of recorded voice
machines demanding information irrelevant to the purpose of my call.

Sometimes a machine will ask if I would like to participate in a survey to
evaluate the service. I would if I didn't believe my response would be
outsourced to another machine that hasn't been discovered yet off the planet!

Report shows crime on rise

SECTION: 1A; Pg. 1

THE CAPITAL-JOURNAL

Violent crime in 12 Midwestern states, including Kansas, increased 5.7 percent
over last year, well above the national average of 2.5 percent, according to an
FBI report on violent crime.

The report, which was released Monday, provides a good comparison between cities
but uses statistics that are six months old, said Topeka Deputy Police Chief Lt.
Col. Walt Wywadis.

"Crime is cyclical, and you can never hold a steady downward trend or a steady
upward trend," Wywadis said. "It's a living, breathing thing, unfortunately."

The report is based on part one crimes - murder, rape, robbery, aggravated
assault, burglary, larceny, auto theft and arson. States included in the Midwest
region by the FBI are Kansas, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota,
Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota and Wisconsin.

Topeka police spokeswoman Kristi Pankratz said the department had seen
significant decreases in part one violent crimes for several years but then
experienced an upward trend in 2005.

The largest increase was in burglaries, which rose more than 22 percent.

Crime in five of the eight part one categories has decreased in the first six
months of 2006, Pankratz said.

In comparison to this time last year, Pankratz said, rapes are down 20 percent,
aggravated assaults are down 14 percent, auto theft is down 10 percent,
burglaries are down 8 percent and thefts are down 5 percent.

Robberies have increased by 20 percent, though, and may increase even higher in
the next few months.

"Business robberies traditionally pick up in the summer and then slack off in
the fall," Wywadis said. "Those trends have held for many, many years."

Wywadis said business owners should use good cash handling practices and stay
alert.

"Crime follows opportunity," Pankratz said. "When more people are outside, crime
is more likely to occur."

She said homeowners should store their lawn equipment and bicycles inside the
garage, and keep garage doors shut and locked. Pankratz also cautioned women not
to leave their purses unattended on park benches.

Homicides also have increased in 2006, with the city recording three homicides
already, Pankratz said. One was ruled as self-defense.

By contrast, the city had recorded one homicide by this time last year.

Wywadis said homicides are more difficult to prevent than other types of crime.

"How can you predict where the next homicide will occur?" he said. "Homicides
tend to be spur-of-the-moment things. Somebody does something to set someone
off."

Wywadis said Topekans are good about being cooperative in high-profile crimes
like homicide, serving as witnesses and being willing to help officials
prosecute the case. They tend to be less cooperative in smaller crimes like
burglary and theft.

"That's the number one thing we could use right now," Wywadis said. "See the
crime, report it and assist with the prosecution of the offense."

Report shows crime on rise

THE CAPITAL-JOURNAL

Violent crime in 12 Midwestern states, including Kansas, increased 5.7 percent
over last year, well above the national average of 2.5 percent, according to an
FBI report on violent crime.

The report, which was released Monday, provides a good comparison between cities
but uses statistics that are six months old, said Topeka Deputy Police Chief Lt.
Col. Walt Wywadis.

"Crime is cyclical, and you can never hold a steady downward trend or a steady
upward trend," Wywadis said. "It's a living, breathing thing, unfortunately."

The report is based on part one crimes - murder, rape, robbery, aggravated
assault, burglary, larceny, auto theft and arson. States included in the Midwest
region by the FBI are Kansas, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota,
Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota and Wisconsin.

Topeka police spokeswoman Kristi Pankratz said the department had seen
significant decreases in part one violent crimes for several years but then
experienced an upward trend in 2005.

The largest increase was in burglaries, which rose more than 22 percent.

Crime in five of the eight part one categories has decreased in the first six
months of 2006, Pankratz said.

In comparison to this time last year, Pankratz said, rapes are down 20 percent,
aggravated assaults are down 14 percent, auto theft is down 10 percent,
burglaries are down 8 percent and thefts are down 5 percent.

Robberies have increased by 20 percent, though, and may increase even higher in
the next few months.

"Business robberies traditionally pick up in the summer and then slack off in
the fall," Wywadis said. "Those trends have held for many, many years."

Wywadis said business owners should use good cash handling practices and stay
alert.

"Crime follows opportunity," Pankratz said. "When more people are outside, crime
is more likely to occur."

She said homeowners should store their lawn equipment and bicycles inside the
garage, and keep garage doors shut and locked. Pankratz also cautioned women not
to leave their purses unattended on park benches.

Homicides also have increased in 2006, with the city recording three homicides

By contrast, the city had recorded one homicide by this time last year.

tend to be spur-of-the-moment things. Somebody does something to set someone
off."

Dropping murder rate surprises NYC

BYLINE: Rick Hampson

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 961 words

DATELINE: NEW YORK

NEW YORK -- It's the city's biggest murder mystery: Why is the murder rate,
which seemed to have hit bottom, suddenly plummeting again?

Murder is down 40% so far this year. There were 85 homicides in the first 2 1/2
months, compared with 141 in the same period last year. The borough of Manhattan
has logged 11 murders, a 60% cut.

At this rate, by year's end, the city would have 386 murders -- the fewest since
1958, when Mantle played for the Yankees, Kennedy Airport was called Idlewild
and mugging was what you did for the camera.


Murder is widely regarded as the most important and objective crime statistic.
But overall, major crime in New York, including robbery and assault, is down a
healthy 8% so far this year.

New Yorkers, who had become a tad blase about crime -- it has dropped by
two-thirds since 1993 -- are taking notice.

"Something terrific is going on," says Andrew Karmen, a criminologist at John
Jay College of Criminal Justice. "If only we knew what was causing it."

There is no consensus on why the crime rate is plunging, but there are many good
reasons why it should be rising:

 * A weak economy. The city has lost thousands of jobs since the terrorist
attacks Sept. 11, and the recovery here is expected to be slow and weak.

 * Fewer police patrols. Hundreds of officers are still on counterterrorism
duty, and overtime pay for other types of policing has been curtailed by the
post-Sept. 11 budget crunch. Arrests, largely as a result, are down 22% as of
March 17, the latest figures available.

 * Warm weather. Nice weather usually means more crime because more people are
on the street. This winter was the warmest on record.

 * National crime trends. In most big cities, the crime rate is flat or rising.
In Los Angeles, for example, murders are up 22% this year.

 * Local crime trends. Although New York finished 2001 with an overall reduction
in crime, the crime rate increased during the six months after July 1. That,
plus storied crime-buster Rudy Giuliani's departure from City Hall on Dec. 31,
led many to believe crime would surge.

In that context, the drop is "almost miraculous," says Karmen, the John Jay
criminologist. "It's as if everybody wiped the slate clean when the calendar
year ended."

But he and others caution that it's too early to celebrate.

"We should wait until summer to draw conclusions," says Eric Monkkonen, a UCLA
criminologist and expert on the history of homicide. Because New York has had
fewer than a third of the murders it did a decade ago, a few shooting sprees
could turn the percentages around. "But good news is good news," Monkkonen says.
"These figures tease us."

The crime statistics for 2001 don't include the nearly 3,000 people killed in
the World Trade Center attack, which the city regards as an act of war.

Meanwhile, various theories have been advanced to explain the puzzling crime
drop. Some posit a Sept. 11 effect.

"I can think of many reasons why crime should be going up in New York," says
Alfred Blumstein of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, "and only one why
it should be going down: 9/11."

Thomas Reppetto, president of the Citizens Crime Commission, says he has
"resisted that notion" partly because crime rose toward the end of 2001 after
dipping immediately after Sept. 11. "But I'm beginning to think it has to be
looked into."

Blumstein speculates that the attacks may have made people more apt to obey the
law and cooperate with the police. UCLA's Monkkonen wonders whether police
officers were energized by Sept. 11 and are patrolling more vigorously and
alertly.

The police credit smarter policing, ranging from campaigns against "quality of
life" offenses, such as public drinking, to a focus on the worst felons. In
addition, they say the computerized crime analysis system called Compstat allows
them see where crime is spiking and respond quickly.

None of this is new, and much of it dates to when Giuliani took office in 1994.

But Eli Silverman, an expert on policing at John Jay College, says the NYPD has
fine-tuned its most successful tactics.

For example, top brass can use videotapes to see whether precinct commanders are
adequately patrolling what Compstat figures say are high-crime locations at
high-crime times.

Some academic observers, notably John Jay's Karmen, say policing is only part of
the explanation. The crime drop, they argue, is a complex phenomenon caused
partly by demographics, economics, and consolidation and retrenchment in the
drug trade.

The debate is not academic. Crime statistics have become political tools. Until
Sept. 11, Giuliani's claim to fame was eight years of lower crime. A reversal
could sorely embarrass the current mayor, Michael Bloomberg.

Meanwhile, many New Yorkers follow the latest weekly crime statistics that are
posted online like sports standings. They hope for more of the same, regardless
of cause.

"I've been asked for the last four years: 'When will we hit the glass bottom?' "
Silverman says. "We won't know until we hit it, but we will. If we kept going
this way, by 2010, we'd have minus murders."

Experts say they are surprised at the continuing drop in murders and other major

Study: Media skews crime stories Even as violent crime rates shrink, news
outlets unfairly focus on young Latino and black men who commit acts of
violence, a media think tank says.

The result of the skewed coverage is a public that believes youth crime is on
the rise and supports policies based on that notion, the Berkeley Media Studies
group asserted today.

The research project examined crime coverage in media outlets across the nation.

Media groups said the report revealed offenses that were mostly unintentional.

Among the findings: Homicide coverage on network news increased 473 percent from
1990 to 1998, while homicides decreased 32.9 percent during that time, the
report said.

While homicides committed by youth declined by 68 percent from 1993 to 1999, 62
percent of the public reported they believed youth crime was on the rise.

Chinese, Taiwanese students clash over flag A fight over whether Taiwan's flag
should hang on the campus of Louisiana State University has pitted Chinese
students against Taiwanese students and the school's administration.  Last
month, the board of LSU's International Cultural Center adopted a policy to
allow any flag from a country whose passport the U.S. State Department
recognizes. Last week, representatives from a Chinese student group said they
will withdraw from the cultural center if Taiwan's flag is hung there.

Killer storms devastate Midwest, West Coast Snow, hail and thunderstorms pelted
parts of southern California, causing a 100 car pileup and scores of other
accidents that killed one person and injured dozens more. Wreckage was scattered
along two miles of roadway late Monday as cars skidded into each other, causing
at least 14 accidents near Fontana, about 45 miles east of Los Angeles. Six
people were hospitalized. A tour bus overturned on an icy mountain highway east
of San Diego, injuring nearly three dozen people, many seriously. Another
devastating storm system tore through Ohio on Monday, killing one man who died
after being struck by lightening.

Booklets to help fight against hate crimes Copies being sent to nearly 1 million
officials, schools

BYLINE: Patrick O'Driscoll

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 4A

LENGTH: 698 words


Every hour, someone commits a hate crime in the USA, says a manual
out today. It is intended to help Americans confront prejudice
in their communities.

"Ten Ways to Fight Hate," one of two new guides being sent to
nearly1 million policymakers, also reports that an average of
18 Americans a day -- eight blacks, three whites, three gays,
three Jews and one Latino -- become victims of hate crime. The
booklet says a cross burning, the classic symbol of Ku Klux Klan
violence, occurs each week in America.


The profile of hatred is based on the Southern Poverty Law Center's
analysis of the FBI's hate-crime statistics for 1997, the latest
available. The approximately 8,000 hate incidents the FBI registered
that year ranged from harassment, assaults and murders to vandalism
and property crimes.

The law center, which created the guides, tracks more than 500
hate groups and advocates against violence related to race, ethnicity,
religion, sexual orientation, disability or other characteristics.

With public horror fresh from Wednesday night's bloody shooting
spree in a Baptist church in Fort Worth, the first copies of the
booklets will be distributed today at a national race-relations
symposium in Washington, D.C.

Copies will be sent to every mayor, police chief and school principal
in the nation. Every governor, state attorney general and member
of Congress also will receive one. The law center also will post
both booklets on its Web site (www.splcenter.org).

Both publications -- the second is "Responding to Hate at School,"
a guide for educators -- advise citizens how to fight the kinds
of hate-motivated violence that have shocked the nation with disturbing
frequency, from last month's shootings in a Jewish community center
in Los Angeles to the dragging death of a black man in June 1988
in Jasper, Texas, a murder case now in trial.

The educators' guide includes concrete steps for dealing with
prejudice and hatred in school. "Ten Ways to Fight Hate" includes
examples of how local communities have dealt with hate incidents.

The advice offered in the booklets isn't radically new or different:
Take action. Unite with others. Support the victims. Create alternatives
to hatred. Speak out against hate. Lobby political leaders to
take a stand. Teach tolerance to children.

"Fighting hate is actually a form of civil defense," says Jim
Carrier, a journalist who researched and wrote "Ten Ways" for
the law center. "Sitting home with your virtue does no good."

The people of East Peoria, Ill., learned that lesson this summer
after Benjamin Smith killed two people and wounded nine others,
all members of racial or ethnic minorities, in a string of shootings
over the Fourth of July weekend. The path of Smith's rampage,
which ended in suicide, did not pass through East Peoria, but
after it ended, word spread that Smith was a follower of a extremist
group whose leader had long promoted its racist cause from his
home in the community.

The past approach in the city of 21,980 people -- 99% of them
white -- was neglect, admits city attorney Dennis Triggs. "We
decided to ignore him, to not give him publicity," Triggs says
of Matt Hale, head of the World Church of the Creator. "He was
disgusting, but we didn't think that he was likely to have any
success."

In the wake of the shootings, Triggs phoned the Southern Poverty
Law Center for help. Officials sent an unfinished version of "Ten
Ways" and put him on the phone with Carrier.

Soon, Mayor Charles Dobbelaire delivered a withering denunciation
of Hale at a community rally. A prayer vigil was staged outside
Hale's house.

Furthermore, the mayor decided "we would be vocal, aggressive
and outspoken -- with one caveat," Triggs says. "We didn't want
to simply make some statement, sympathize with the victims and
their families, and that's the end of it."

The result: A 15-member human relations commission is now in place,
and the city is moving through the ranks of all staff, board and
commission members with diversity sensitivity training.

"Talk to us one to five years from now," Triggs adds.

CRIME AT 26-YEAR LOW

BYLINE: By RICHARD T. PIENCIAK, With Jon Sorenson and News Wire Services

SECTION: News; Pg.  4

LENGTH: 404 words


A double-digit drop in murders and assaults in 1996 has brought the rate of
violent crime in New York State to its lowest level since 1970, according to
federal figures released yesterday.

The plunge in violent crime between 1995 and 1996 mirrored the drop across the
country.

The Justice Department figures indicated that nationwide, murders and assaults
had fallen for a fifth straight year to a level not seen since 1969.

The most striking decrease came in the murder category, which dropped 9% between
1995 and 1996 to 19,645 homicides nationwide. Overall, the number of reported
violent crimes dipped 6.5%.

"This is really a striking new low," said Prof. Alfred Blumstein of Carnegie
Mellon University in Pittsburgh.

In New York State the news was even better, with a decrease in nearly every
criminal category. Violent crime was down 13.4%, homicide was down 12.7%, and
car thefts fell 12.4%.

Criminal justice experts attributed the nation's declining violent crime rate to
the continuing decrease in juvenile delinquency, the aging population and the
effects of a harsher judicial system.

"Many baby boomers are now in their 40s and have mellowed out," said Prof. Jack
Levin, director of the program for the study of violence at Northeastern
University in Boston. "They are not committing the high-risk violent and
property offenses they did 10 years ago."

Levin said better programs to reduce crime have contributed, too. "We are doing
all sorts of things to reduce crime: locking away more violent prisoners, going
after small offenses so they don't lead to large offenses.

"We are taking the guns off the streets in high-crime areas; we've formed
partnerships between police and residents. There have been large-scale
grassroots efforts in major cities, and the total effort is paying off."

Gov. Pataki bragged, "New York State is a safer place to live now because of our
policies that get tough on criminals." He said the state's rate for 1996 was the
lowest in the violent crime category since 1970.

In Washington, President Clinton declared, "We are finally and decisively
tipping the scales of justice in favor of law-abiding Americans."

Other 1996-to-1995 national crime rates were also heartening: Overall crime down
3%; property crime was down 2%; forcible rapes went down 2%; robberies were down
7%; burglaries dipped 3.6%; and motor vehicle thefts were down 5.2%.

Teen crime surge sparks crackdown

BYLINE: Bruce Frankel

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 1A

LENGTH: 1014 words

DATELINE: NEW YORK


Alarmed by an explosion in juvenile violence, communities are enacting get-tough
truancy programs, municipal curfews and shopping mall bans that amount to a
nationwide crackdown on teen-agers.

With violent crime among teens up 57% in the last decade, the aim of such
efforts is clear: reverse a growing sense of declining authority and extinguish
menacing visions of a Clockwork Orange society.

The "nation is in a state of alarm," says Midge Decter of New York state's youth
violence task force. "If something effective isn't done, we're going to see a
lot more ugliness."

While the teen programs have cut crime in cities such as San Jose, Calif., and
El Paso, Texas, civil liberties groups say they're ripe for discrimination - and
may be unconstitutional.

But the crackdown is growing:

-- In Miami, the ACLU says about 100 youths have been arrested on curfew
violations since an ordinance was enacted Feb. 17. Wednesday, a judge halted the
curfew, saying it violated the right of young people to move about freely. Teen
curfews also have sprung up in Chicago, Dallas, Newark, Phoenix and Tampa.

-- In New York City - where 100,000 students, or 10%, are absent each day from
school - police soon plan to sweep truants off the streets and send them back to
school. Similar programs have sprouted in Atlanta, Milwaukee, New Orleans,
Oklahoma City and San Diego.

-- In Newport News, Va., a shopping mall's decision to ban teen-agers on Friday
and Saturday nights unless they are accompanied by an adult was greeted by
widespread support. Malls nationwide have enacted similar restrictions.

"It's totally unfair," says Stephanie Newman, 15, of Miami's 11 p.m. curfew.
"It's not going to stop the ones who are doing the stuff that's bad. They don't
care if they get caught."

But Lawrence Sherman, president of the Crime Control Institute in Washington,
says such measures may be inevitable in the current environment. "If the
families won't supervise these children, then perhaps government must," he says.

Behind the get-tough trend are frightening statistics. From 1983-92, the FBI
says, arrests of juveniles under 18 for violent crimes jumped 50%; weapons
violations by 117%; murder and manslaughter by 128%.

But some experts say many of the new programs are overreactions that unfairly
penalize the vast majority of the USA's 25 million teens, while doing little to
address the conditions that lead to crime.

Critics also call such programs unconstitutional, discriminatory and
politically-motivated. "The Constitution does not merely apply to those over the
age of 18," says Robyn Blumner, head of Florida's American Civil Liberties
Union.

And a few communities are rejecting the crackdown altogether.

In Philadelphia, with the nation's 4th highest truancy rate, officials had
planned to begin rounding up, searching and handcuffing truants before taking
them to truancy centers. But public outcry in a city where black, Hispanic and
Asian students make up 80% of enrollment has forced officials to reconsider.

"Handcuffing truants offended the sensibilities of many," says Richard Glean, a
school official. Many also questioned why a cash-strapped, crime-ridden city
would devote precious police resources to picking up kids skipping school.

Police say there are plenty of reasons. Since San Jose began its truancy program
in 1981, daytime burglaries dropped by 50%. In Oklahoma City, daytime burglaries
fell by 33% in the first two years of its program.

"Getting kids in school is the most important crime prevention thing we can do -
short-term or long-term," says Milwaukee Sheriff Richard Artison, who notes 70%
of all adult inmates are high school dropouts.

Since November, Milwaukee police have been picking up an average of 150 truants
a week - including an 8-year-old who hadn't been enrolled in two years and a
16-year-old peddling 40 vials of crack.

To further deter truants, schools from Seattle to Boston have started programs
that flunk students who miss 12 classes. At Seattle's Franklin High, 19% of
students lost credit for one or more classes last semester.

"No doubt about it. We're drawing the line," says principal Sharon Green. "We
can't do our job if they're not here."

The lines are also being drawn on the nation's streets - where the ACLU says
nightly curfews are forcing teen-agers indoors by 11 p.m. in hundreds of cities
and towns.

Experts say more curfews are likely following a November federal appeals court
ruling that declared a Dallas curfew constitutional on the grounds that the
city's crime created an emergency situation.

But there is widespread concern that curfews and other teen restrictions will be
selectively enforced - with urban teens targeted and suburbanites unrestricted.

"We already have a society in which young black men are criminalized at an early
age in vastly disproportionate numbers," says Theodore Shaw of the NAACP Legal
Defense and Education Fund.

Teens present a special dilemma for the nation's 35,000 shopping malls, which
want to control unruly kids without alienating the majority of teens, who spend
an estimated $ 93 billion a year. Still, some malls are willing to take the
risk.

After Roger Brown made a late-night visit to the Newport News mall he manages,
he decided to ban unaccompanied teens on weekend nights.

"It was unreal," says Brown of the teens' behavior. "The foul language, the
belligerence, the rudeness, the shoving. . . . Something had to be done." The
community cheered.

Other malls are getting tough. too.

"We don't want something happening here like happened up in Irving," says Brian
Griffin of Sunrise Mall in Corpus Christi, Texas, referring to the case of a
father of two killed in a gang crossfire last year.

While many experts agree it's crucial that society reimpose standards of
conduct, many also say truancy programs, curfews and shopping mall bans will
have little lasting effect on juvenile crime.

Says Yale University sociology professor Albert Reese: "We're grasping at
straws."

Fear of numbers stalls crime control

International tourists may think Miami is the most dangerous city to visit, but
it's not.

"Across the country, the most dangerous big city in 1992 was Atlanta." That's
how the Chicago Tribune reported national crime statistics this past weekend.
It's not what our city and state leaders want to read with their morning coffee.

Rather than continue to deny and defend the statistics, it's time this city
looked them squarely in the eye. Unfortunately, our police chief doesn't seem to
be able to do that.

The simple facts he's trying to dodge are these: According to the FBI's latest
crime statistics, Atlanta leads the nation in violent crime among cities of its
size, with 3,860 homicides, rapes, robberies and aggravated assaults for every
100,000 residents. That's higher than Miami, Newark, and all other cities in its
population range. It's even higher than New York, Chicago and Los Angeles - the
cities most Americans perceive as having the worst crime problem.

And what was Chief Eldrin Bell's response? He calls the numbers unfair. He says
you can't rank cities. Why? Because we get a lot of visitors (Miami and New York
don't?); and because this city is more honest in its reporting of crimes, while
other cities "want their figures to look good."

It is the wrong tack for a politician to take. Atlantans already call crime the
No. 1 problem here, according to a poll conducted by this newspaper and WSB-TV.

As a city leader, Bell should seize the numbers and use them to bolster his own
argument that what Georgia needs is some measure of statewide gun control. The
FBI data show that, nationally, firearms are used in seven of every 10 killings.
It is no coincidence that the most violent city is in a state where guns are so
readily available that federal authorities call us a "source state" for other
states' guns.

Clearly, Bell is not responsible for that, nor can his department alone solve
it. Nor can the city's police wipe out poverty, eradicate drugs or cure all
other causes of crime. The best thing Bell could do is use his bully pulpit to
move state leaders into action. Atlanta needs leadership, not defensiveness.

Ours is a city on the brink of greatness - a growing, gleaming international
city that will make its mark as the 1996 host of the Olympics. And we have a
crime problem. It's time our leaders faced up to that fact.

Students 'easy prey' on campus

BYLINE: Pat Ordovensky

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 1A

LENGTH: 222 words


Student apathy is the most serious safety problem on the nation's colleges, say
campus police chiefs surveyed by USA TODAY for its crime series.

Students have an ''Alice in Wonderland attitude that a campus is not part of the
planet Earth,'' says Robert Wiatt of Texas A&M University. That makes them
''easy prey for opportunists.''

Northern Illinois' James Elliott calls it ''naivete.''

Other problems encountered by the campus chiefs: drug and alcohol abuse; too few
police; and non-students' access to campus.

The survey of 494 four-year colleges with more than 3,000 students also shows:

- Violent crimes occur at the rate of 0.7 for every 1,000 students compared to
6-per-1,000 in the whole population.

- Highest violent crime rate is in the South, 1 for every 1,282 students; lowest
is the Midwest, 1 per 1,639.

- 94% of all reported crimes are non-violent, involving only property.

- At 67% of the schools, police are allowed to carry guns.

The best predictor of violent crime is the size of the town.

A college with less than 10,000 students in a city of more than 500,000 people
is most prone to violence.

The safest: a school with 10,000 to 20,000 students in a city with less than
100,000.

Public concern about campus crime has produced a new law requiring colleges to
disclose crime statistics.

Fire races through Calif. canyons

SECTION: NATIONAL; NATIONAL DIGEST; Pg. 4A

LENGTH: 755 words

DATELINE: MALIBU, Calif.; WASHINGTON; CHICAGO; CAPE CANAVERAL



MALIBU, Calif. - A wind-whipped blaze roared through brush and canyon    country
overlooking the Pacific Ocean on Sunday, charring 4,000 acres,    destroying a
million-dollar estate and forcing more than 2,000 campers    to flee. The fire
also consumed another home under construction, two    cabins and a maintenance
shed. Crews had the fire about 50 percent    contained Sunday evening, fire
spokeswoman Beth Maden said. No more    structures were threatened, she said.
Farther inland, near Simi Valley,    firefighters contained a blaze that burned
about 375 acres in the Black    Canyon-Box Canyon area. No structures were
burned and there were no      injuries, officials said.



 Abortion rally draws thousands

 An anti-abortion rally in Columbus, Ohio, drew at least 10,000 people
Saturday, and 89 people were arrested in Pittsburgh at a protest    outside an
abortion clinic. One of those arrested was suspected of    knocking a police
officer to the ground, Lt. Thomas Neill said. The    officer was not hurt, he
said. In Columbus, police estimated at least    10,000 people had gathered for a
pre-rally concert at a downtown park,    the first in a series of weekend events
sponsored by both sides of the    abortion debate. A coalition of
abortion-rights organizations planned    to sponsor a March for Choice downtown
Sunday.



 Violent crime on the rise

 WASHINGTON - Violent crime and personal theft rose 3.1 percent in    1988, the
second straight year in which these offenses went up, the    Justice Department
reported Sunday. Blacks and Hispanics were about    twice as likely to be crime
victims as whites last year, the    department's Bureau of Justice Statistics
said. While whites were    robbed at the rate of 4.7 per 1,000 people during
1988, the rate for    blacks was 9.4 and for Hispanics, 10.1, according to the
bureau's    National Crime Survey. Males, young people, inner-city residents and

    renters also were more likely to have been crime victims last year.



 Hearings planned on Iowa crash

 CHICAGO - The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is holding    four
days of hearings this week into the fiery crash of a crippled    DC-10 passenger
jet and is expected to recommend far-reaching changes    for the airline and
aircraft-manufacturing industries. United Airlines    Flight 232 crashed July 19
in Sioux City, Iowa, killing 112 of the 296    people on board. "We'll get into
matters such as the design and    certification of that particular engine, the
design of the hydraulic    system, and there probably will be some discussion of
crash-fire rescue    operations and the crashworthiness of today's airplanes,"
said Ted    Lopatkiewicz, an NTSB spokesman. The hearings are to begin Tuesday.



 'Atlantis' back at launch site

 CAPE CANAVERAL - Atlantis returned to its launching base Sunday riding
piggyback on a Boeing 747 jet that ferried it from California. The    modified
jetliner touched down here at 5:04 p.m., and workers began    removing Atlantis
from its perch atop the aircraft. The 747 left    Edwards Air Force Base,
Calif., on Saturday, but rain prevented it from    landing here later that day
and the orbiter made an overnight stop at    Columbus Air Force Base in
Mississippi. Atlantis landed at Edwards on    Oct. 23 after a five-day mission
in which the five-member crew sent the    Galileo probe on its six-year journey
to the planet Jupiter.



 Look for Venus, crescent moon

 WASHINGTON - Venus and the crescent moon will make a brilliant pair in    the
evening sky Thursday, offering delightful viewing if the weather is    clear.
The planet Venus is the brightest "star" in the sky and will    be visible in
the southwest as night falls. It will be shining to the    right of the thin
crescent moon, making for a dramatic view, reports    Sky & Telescope magazine.
Also visible should be Saturn, to the upper    left, though it will be much
fainter. The magazine said viewers also    may be able to observe the phenomenon
of "earthshine." That is the    reflected light from Earth brightening the
normally dark portion of the    moon so it becomes visible. Because the dark
section of the moon glows    dimly gray when this occurs, it has been called
"the old moon in the    new moon's arms."

Orem ranked 12th for safety in the U.S.

BYLINE: By Michael N. Westley The Salt Lake Tribune

SECTION: LOCAL

LENGTH: 396 words


Orem Mayor Jerry Washburn said he is not surprised that the quiet Utah County
town has been ranked the 12th-safest city in the United States by a leading
research firm.

Surprised, no. But pleased? Oh yes, he said.

"This high ranking happens fairly regularly. That indicates to me that it's a
community that's based upon some values that are contrary to normal trends where
cities are experiencing crime," Washburn said.

Six of Utah's cities made the list, which was made public today by the
Kansas-based Morgan Quitno Press. The 13th annual report reviewed 2005 crime
statistics from 371 American cities using data from the Federal Bureau of
Investigation's uniform crime report, which was released in September.

Washburn said Orem's relatively small population of 90,000 people gives it a
hometown feel - something he said he is proud to be a part of. He attributes the
city's clean crime slate to a family-oriented atmosphere and an aggressive
public safety department.

"I think it boils down to a lifestyle that is not conducive to crime," the mayor
said.

Orem police, he said, work to stay out in front of trends in gangs, theft and
drugs.

"I think we face the same challenges that many other cities do. We're not
without incidents of family violence and we're concerned about those kinds of
things," Washburn said.

Utah's capital city ranked lowest among the state's six cities on the list at
number 247. Its peers include Fort Worth, Texas, Portland, Ore., and Los
Angeles, Calif.

Brick, N.J., ranked number one in the nation, followed by Amherst, N.Y., and
Mission Viejo, Calif. according to the report. St. Louis was ranked the most
dangerous city in the country with Detroit and Flint, Mich., trailing close
behind.

The rankings are achieved through a process which examines type of crime and
relationship to national averages. The crime data for each city is broken into
six categories - murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary and motor
vehicle theft. The data is plugged into a formula that compares a city's report
against national numbers.

"While this methodology appears rather complicated, it results in fairer
treatment," the firm wrote in a news release.

Three of Utah's cities on the list - Orem, Sandy and Salt Lake City - climbed
the chart between 2004 and 2005. Provo, Ogden and West Valley City dropped in
ranking, according to the report

Serious Crime Decreased For Fifth Year in a Row

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD

SECTION: Section 1; Page 10; Column 5; National Desk

LENGTH: 757 words


Serious and violent crime dropped in the first half of last year, continuing a
pattern that began five years ago, according to preliminary statistics to be
released today by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The five-year decline is
the longest in 25 years.

The figures, based on information reported to the F.B.I. by local police
departments, showed that the national crime rate decreased 3 percent in the
first six months of 1996, led by a 7 percent drop in murders.


The news was greeted with applause by experts, many of whom have been reluctant
until now to believe that was more than a short-term statistical aberration. But
both the length of the decline and the fact that the biggest drop came in
homicides, the most serious crime, appeared particularly significant to the
specialists.

"I have been a skeptic," said Franklin Zimring, a leading criminologist and
director of the Earl Warren Legal Institute at the University of California at
Berkeley. "But now, because of the length of the decline, its magnitude and the
number of places it is occurring, I think I am experiencing a foxhole
conversion."

Alfred Blumstein, a professor of criminology at Carnegie Mellon University, said
the causes of the decline in the crime rate were complex and hard to calculate
in isolation. Some of the decrease, he said, could be attributed to more police
officers on the streets and to the Brady law, which mandates a five-day waiting
period for handgun purchases.

But, Professor Blumstein said, "I suspect it also has to do with the revised,
more aggressive tactics" being used by the police in a number of large cities,
including New York, where police officers have made concentrated efforts to get
handguns off the streets and to take them away from young people.

In fact, the figures that are to be released today show that the nation's cities
with populations of more than one million recorded the largest decline in
overall crime -- 6 percent in the six months. Cities with populations of 500,000
to just under one million had no change in their crime rates, while smaller
cities showed declines of 1 to 4 percent. Rural counties recorded a 3 percent
drop and suburban law enforcement agencies reported a 1 percent decrease.

Professor Blumstein said that this appeared to continue a trend from 1995, when
only three large cities, New York, Chicago and Detroit, accounted for 32 percent
of the nation's drop in homicides.

The biggest cities tend to be "more sophisticated and pick up on new police
tactics more quickly," Professor Blumstein said. And they also have the
resources to move faster with new policing strategies.

It is becoming clear, Professor Blumstein added, that William J. Bratton, the
former New York City Police Commissioner who pioneered the city's tough new
police efforts, has had a large influence on other police departments around the
country. "One of the things Bill Bratton did is capture a lot of police
departments' attention, " Professor Blumstein said.

"After watching Bratton, they said, 'Hey, we can do something about this.' "

That represented an important change in attitude, he said, because there was a
widespread view 10 years ago that the police could not do much about crime but
respond to it. "Now that has changed," Professor Blumstein said. "The police
feel they can do something. It has changed their deployment, their tactics and
the way commanders hold lower levels responsible for reducing crime."

The F.B.I.'s crime index is composed of four violent crimes (murder, robbery,
aggravated assault and rape) and four property crime (burglary, motor vehicle
theft, arson and minor larcenies like shoplifting). Murders dropped 7 percent in
the first half of 1996, robbery and aggravation assault declined 5 percent.
Arson was the only offense to increase, by 2 percent.

President Clinton issued a written statement saying that some credit for the
continued decrease should be given to his sponsorship of the ban on assault
weapons, to the Brady law and to his plan to put more police officers on the
streets.

"At the beginning of my Administration," Mr. Clinton said, "we set out to change
this country's approach to crime by putting more officers on our streets through
community policing, and taking guns out of the hands of criminals. We are making
a difference."

Professor Zimring said he remained doubtful whether any experts really
understood the causes for the decline in crime. "I think criminology is at the
brainstorming stage," he said.

DATELINE: MIAMI, May 19


Crime is on the decline in Miami, a port for drug smugglers that in 1980 had the
nation's highest murder rate, state officials say.

The Florida Department of Law Enforcement said Tuesday that the number of
serious crimes reported in Miami, the state's largest city, dropped 7.2 percent
for the first quarter of 1982 from the same period a year ago.

But crime in some other cities, notably Orlando, the home of Disney World, was
on the upswing. Over all, crime in Florida dropped 5.2 percent in the first
three months of this year, the state agency said.

The figures combine reports of all serious crimes, ranging from arson, burglary
and auto theft to rape and murder.

The persistence of hate crime

SECTION: CANADA &; WORLD; Pg. B4

LENGTH: 530 words


The hate crime rate remains steady in the U.S. and blacks remain the racial
group most likely to experience racially motivated violence.

After Wednesday night's mass shooting in Charleston, S.C., the Washington Post
offers some context on hate crimes and hate groups.

Blacks experience the most hate crime

FBI hate crime data show that more than 50 out of every one million black
citizens was the victim of a racially motivated hate crime in 2012, the highest
among any racial group. But this is almost certainly an undercount. The FBI is
reliant on state and local law enforcement agencies to categorize and report
hate crimes correctly. There is general agreement the FBI numbers are
significantly lower than they should be.

Hate crime rates stable over past decade

The Bureau of Justice Statistics provides the most comprehensive overall count
of hate crime incidents. Their data, drawn from interviews with victims, shows
the number of hate crimes occurring has remained fairly constant over the past
10 years, hovering between 200,000 and 300,000 annually. According to the
Southern Poverty Law Center, the number of active hate groups, which it defines
as "groups having beliefs or practices that attack or malign an entire class of
people, typically for their immutable characteristics," more than doubled from
457 in 1999 to 1,018 in 2011. Since then the number of active groups has
declined to 784. The SPLC attributes this to various causes - including
widespread squabbling and splintering within the groups themselves.

Hate groups concentrated in Deep South, Northern Plains Hate groups aren't
distributed evenly by geography. Controlling for the population in each state,
hate groups are concentrated mostly in the Deep South and in the Montana/Idaho
region. Vermont and New Hampshire also stand out. Partially, this is a function
of low population - Vermont has fewer than 700,000 residents, which combined
with its four active hate groups gives it a high per capita value. But this may
not just be an artifact of low population.

Researchers at Humboldt State University recently mapped geocoded tweets
containing hate speech, and their map does appear to show a high incidence of
hate-tweets originating in Vermont.

Hardship breeds hatred

Researchers have tried to suss out the causes of hate crime. A 2002 review of
hate crime literature by Princeton economist Alan Krueger looked at the economic
determinants of hate crime - whether these crimes rose and fell in response to
economic conditions like poverty rate and unemployment. Krueger concludes that
"rather than economic conditions, the hate crimes literature points to a
breakdown in law enforcement and official sanctioning and encouragement of civil
disobedience as significant causes of the occurrence of hate crimes." Not so
fast, say economists Matt Ryan and Peter Leeson. In 2010 they examined the links
between hate groups and hate crime in the United States. They found no
relationship between the number of hate groups in a state, and the number of
hate crimes that occur within that state. Instead, the primary determinants seem
to be economic. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2015 Postmedia Network Inc. All rights reserved.

Targeted City Crime Area Working;
Speaker's Forte Is Reducing Crime

SECTION: B; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 511  words

DATELINE: Lancaster, PA


BY CHIP SMEDLEY

Staff Writer

David M. Kennedy, who advocates using focused deterrence to reduce drug-dealing
and its related violence in urban areas, is bringing his story to Millersville
University.

Kennedy, director of the Center for Crime Prevention and Control at John Jay
College of Criminal Justice in New York City, will present "Don't Shoot:
Violence, Prison, Race and Common Ground," at 8 p.m. Thursday in the Student
Memorial Center's Reighard Multipurpose Room. His talk is free and open to the
public.

The Lancaster Violent Crime Reduction Initiative is based on Kennedy's work. His
program first was used in High Point, N.C., a city of approximately 100,000,
between Winston-Salem and Greensboro. Since the program's inception in 2003,
neighborhoods targeted by High Point police have experienced a 50 percent drop
in drug sales and drug-related activity.

The neighborhood targeted in Lancaster's first initiative in 2009 also
experienced significant decreases in drug-related activity.

Dr. Mary Glazier, chair of MU's sociology and anthropology department, helped
arrange Kennedy's appearance.

Glazier works with the crime reduction initiative, as well as the Public
Research Safety Institute, which conducts research on issues related to crime
and public safety.

"I met him at a Department of Justice conference," she said. "He and I spoke
about some of the challenges associated with convincing people in the criminal
justice system that sometimes not prosecuting someone can be more powerful in
reducing crime than prosecuting and jailing them."

Millersville is funding Kennedy's visit because he illustrates this year's
academic theme, "Create, Innovate, Engage," Glazier said.

Kennedy serves as co-chair of the National Network for Safe Communities, an
alliance of more than 50 jurisdictions dedicated to reducing crime and
incarceration and addressing the racial conflict associated with traditional
crime policies. He also helped design the U.S. Justice Department's Strategic
Approaches to Community Safety initiative, the Treasury Department's Youth Crime
Interdiction Initiative and the Bureau of Justice Assistance's Drug Market
Intervention Program.

"Contrary to decades of thinking in criminology and law enforcement, Kennedy's
work has shown that many offenders are capable of making rational choices to
stop offending if given a clear and honest message regarding the need to do so,"
Glazier said. "Focused deterrence has provided a model for law enforcement to
engage in the process of rebuilding trust with community members, for offenders
to engage in a process of making positive personal changes and for community
members to engage in the work of rebuilding their neighborhoods."

Kennedy also directed the Boston Gun Project, whose Operation Ceasefire
intervention decreased gun homicide victims under the age of 24. It was honored
by the Ford Foundation with its Innovations in Government Award.

His latest book, published in 2011, is "Don't Shoot: One Man, a Street
Fellowship, and the End of Violence in Inner-City America."

FBI: Violent crime in U.S. down 6 percent

SECTION: A SECTION; Pg. 2A

LENGTH: 747 words


WASHINGTON

Violent crime dropped 6 percent in 2010, marking the fourth straight
year-to-year decline, while property crime was down for the eighth straight
year, falling 2.7 percent, the FBI reported Monday.

Nationwide, there were an estimated 1.2 million violent crimes reported to
authorities in 2010 and an estimated 9 million property crimes.

An aging population, better policing and continued high rates of imprisonment
for criminals are helping to drive down crime rates, criminologists say.

Robbery fell 10 percent, rape dropped 5 percent, and murder, non-negligent
manslaughter and aggravated assault fell more than 4 percent.

Each category of property crime offenses decreased in 2010. The largest decline,
7.4 percent, was for motor vehicle thefts. Burglaries decreased 2 percent and
larceny-thefts declined 2.4 percent.

Attorney General Eric Holder said federal prosecutors and agents have worked
with state and local law enforcement to increase community participation in
protecting neighborhoods. On a related front, he said that law enforcement
agencies have targeted gang leadership in communities from Florida to New York,
and from Tennessee to North Carolina.

CAMP PENDLETON, CALIF.

2 Marines killed, 120 acres burned in helicopter crash

A helicopter that went down during a training exercise at Southern California's
Camp Pendleton killed the two Marines onboard and set off a fast-moving brush
fire on the base Monday.

The blaze burned 120 acres and was 80 percent contained Monday evening, a base
statement said.

The 1 p.m. wreck involved a twin-engine, two-seat AH-1W Cobra attack helicopter
belonging to the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing, a Marine Corps statement said. It
crashed in the southeast corner of the base near the community of Fallbrook.

NEW YORK

9/11 milestone: Family settles last wrongful-death lawsuit

The last wrongful death lawsuit remaining from the 9/11 terrorist attacks was
settled Monday when a family that sought to expose weaknesses in the nation's
air safety system decided it had done what it could to give voice to a hockey
scout who died that day.

The family of Mark Bavis decided to settle after making public as much
information as it could about what it viewed as security lapses on Sept. 11,
2001, at Boston's Logan Airport, where United Airlines Flight 175 originated,
attorney Donald Migliori said.

Bavis, who was 31, was a scout for the Los Angeles Kings hockey team.

CHICAGO

Wrigley sells iconic namesake building to investment firm

The Wrigley Building, an iconic Chicago skyscraper, has been sold by the company
that gives the building its name.

The Wm. Wrigley Jr. Co. announced Monday the building has been sold to the
Chicago-based investment firm of BDT Capital Partners. Groupon co-founders Brad
Keywell and Eric Lefkofsky and Zeller Realty Group are minority partners in the
deal.

In a statement, Wrigley chief financial officer Reuben Gamoran said the chewing
gum maker has been committed to securing new ownership for the building that
would ensure its future and protect its legacy.

IRAN

Despite setback, U.S. hikers will be freed, delegation says

A delegation of U.S. Christian and Muslim leaders returned from Iran Monday
disappointed they could not immediately secure the release of two Americans
jailed as spies for more than two years, but optimistic their release was
imminent.

The delegation met for over an hour Saturday in Iran with President Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad and other senior government officials.

Delegation members say they were invited by Ahmadinejad following their advocacy
on behalf of Americans Shane Bauer and Josh Fattal, who were arrested in July
2009 along the Iraq-Iran border.

BURUNDI

Gunmen attack crowded pub, leaving at least 30 dead

A group of gunmen clad in army fatigues and armed with military-grade weapons
burst into a crowded bar in Burundi on Sunday night and opened fire, Burundian
officials said, killing more than 30 people and laying bare how combustible
Burundi is a year after a disputed election.

Burundian officials immediately accused an armed opposition political party that
had recently fled into the thick forests of neighboring Democratic Republic of
Congo, and many Burundians fear their country could be sliding back toward war.

In the 1990s, more than 200,000 people were killed in this tiny central African
nation in ethnically driven violence that soon became a dangerous free-for-all
involving warring militias, rival politicians, criminal gangs and child
soldiers.

Fighting crime;
Feds to help efforts in Tulsa

SECTION: OPINION; OUR VIEWS; Pg. 8A

LENGTH: 291 words


VIOLENT crime has decreased across the country in recent years but has increased
in Tulsa. The 69 homicides there last year were a record for the city. Just last
week, a bank teller was killed during a holdup in which two other people were
wounded.

Now local law enforcement is getting some help from the federal government.
Tulsa is one of 15 U.S. cities selected by the Justice Department to take part
in a new program that seeks to reduce violent crime. The program, called Violent
Crime Impact Teams, will result in the FBI adding two agents to its Tulsa office
and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and Explosives adding four
agents, an analyst and a research assistant.

Local and federal authorities in Tulsa have been doing all they can to stem
violent crime. U.S. Attorney David O'Meilia notes that his office has stepped up
prosecution of cases involving gun-law offenders in recent years. Even so,
Tulsa's crime rate has increased.

O'Meilia says many of the killings late last year apparently were tied to
gang-related activity, and it's tough to know when those outbreaks will occur.
This new push by the Justice Department will focus on firearms violations, since
those offenders often are tied to gangs, illegal drugs and organized crime.

The Justice Department picked some places you might expect (Philadelphia, Miami,
Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles) and some others you might not (Columbus,
Ohio, Richmond, Va.). Officials in each city would prefer not to need the help.
But they should view this program not as an indictment, but as an effort to make
their cities even more livable. Tulsa Police Chief David Been took the right
approach. "This is what we need now," he said. "We are going to make the streets
of Tulsa safer."

Crime Rate Misconceptions

SECTION: OP-ED; Pg. B06; LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

LENGTH: 196 words


David Nielsen [letters, Sept. 16] thinks the 1995-98 population growth rate of
5.5 percent in Texas vis-a-vis that of almost zero in New York explains why the
crime rate fell more slowly in Texas than in New York. He says, "A faster
growing state [Texas] naturally would have a higher crime rate than a slower
growing one [New York]."

Mr. Nielsen does not understand the distinction between the total number of
crimes and the crime rate, defined as the number of serious crimes per 100,000
resident population. Other things being equal, a population increase will
certainly increase (or reduce the decrease in) the number of crimes. But if we
ignore the criminal propensity of the population increment, the increase cannot
raise or lower the crime rate.

If "a faster growing state naturally would have a higher crime rate," why did
Virginia have a 1991 crime rate of only 4,607 per 100,000 compared with rates of
6,231 for New York and 10,768 for the District, given that the 1980-90
population growth rates were 15.7 percent for Virginia, 2.5 percent for New York
and a negative 4.9 percent for the District?

A NEW GENERATION OF KILLERS?

BYLINE: By Matthew Robinson, Investor's Business Daily

SECTION: National Issue; Pg. A1

LENGTH: 1264 words


Two shootings in the last month outraged the nation. Both were at schools. Both
were committed by boys under 14 years of age.

Police say two young boys, ages 11 and 13, opened fire on classmates in
Jonesboro, Ark., killing four students and one teacher. Shortly after, Andrew
''Satan'' Wurst, a 14-year-old, killed a teacher at an eighth-grade graduation
dance in Edinboro, Pa.

Such stories attract media attention and give the impression that this is a
growing trend - especially in once crime-free rural areas. But are kids really
committing more crimes?

No, say Justice Department data.  While juvenile crime rates are far higher than
they were just two decades ago, they have fallen in recent years. But as
Jonesboro and Edinboro do show, there has been one change: the use of firearms
in juvenile crime.

Overall the crime picture has brightened since '94. (See chart.) From '89 to
'93, the rate of juvenile crime grew 43%. But by '95, the rates returned to
their '89 levels.

From '94 to '95, violent crime by juveniles actually fell more than adult crime
(25% compared with 18%).

Juveniles accounted for nearly one out of five arrests for violent crimes in
'96. But youths ages 12 to 17 were three times as likely as adults to be victims
of a violent crime in '94, Justice figures show.

Although overall crime rates are down, the Edinboro and Jonesboro cases give the
perception that crime is up in suburbs and in rural areas. But this is only
partly true.

Juvenile arrests for violent crime are down in big cities. They fell by 6.8%
from '95 to '96. In the suburbs, juvenile violent- crime arrests were up 2.2%.
But in rural areas such arrests fell 2.7%.

''Crime and drug trends usually sweep through cities and then expand outward.
Change can't be that far behind (in the suburbs and rural areas),'' said Melissa
Sickmund, a Justice Department analyst.

So why the recent drop in juvenile violent crime?

No one knows for sure.

But a lot of new ideas are now getting into the war on teen crime. States are
cracking down - and so are cities. Local communities are trying to nip juvenile
crime in the bud. They're passing curfew laws and targeting truancy.  They're
also trying violent kids as adults.

In '95, one-third of the nation's estimated 2,300 known juvenile murders took
place in 10 large U.S. counties. Those counties include such major cities as Los
Angeles, Chicago, New York, Detroit, Dallas, Houston, Phoenix, San Bernardino,
Calif., Philadelphia and St. Louis.

So why the perception of widespread carnage among America's youth?

One factor is media coverage, says Delbert Elliott, director of the Center for
the Study and Prevention of Violence, a Colorado-based think tank.

''Today's youth are more frequently the victims of violence,'' he writes. ''But
about the same proportion of youth are committing serious violent offenses today
as in 1980 and their frequency of offending is approximately the same.''

Still, Elliott sees one important change: ''Today's violent acts are more
lethal; a larger proportion of these acts result in serious injury or death.''

Part of the reason: Use of firearms is up. Between '85 and '95, nonfirearm
murders of juveniles increased by only 9%. But the number of juveniles murdered
with firearms increased 153%.

''Most of these kids are presented as scary images. But much of this violence is
still very rare,'' said Sickmund. ''Most of the crimes are kids' stuff like
property crimes. The system has changed. There are now more zero- tolerance
policies.''

Juvenile violence problems tend to surround schools, something that especially
alarms voters. School violence rose 24% from '89 to '95.

Most kids aren't using weapons in classes. The most dangerous part of the day
comes when kids are going to and from school.

Most juvenile crimes occur from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m., say government data.

Ten percent of high school students say they have carried a weapon on school
property in the last month. Why?

''You have to look at juvenile crime - especially school violence - in the
context of the environment surrounding kids,'' said Frederick Lynch, a professor
of government at Claremont-McKenna College in California. ''These communities
have gotten much rougher -you'd almost have to be crazy not to carry a gun.''

In any year, one in 12 high schoolers is threatened or injured by a weapon at
school. And fully 5% of high schoolers say they missed at least one day in the
last month because they were afraid to go to school.

In response, states are changing the way they handle juvenile crime.

States have clamped down in response to the fear of young ''superpredators.''
Some 41 states passed laws from '92 to '95 making it easier for juveniles to be
tried as adults. And every state in the Union has made it easier to transfer
juveniles to criminal courts.

''The juvenile justice system is a reflection of how we view childhood,'' said
Lynch. ''The system was designed during a time of the two-parent family and when
childhood was considered a special time. But the time between childhood and
adulthood is shrinking.''

''What we are getting are more kids willing to pull the trigger,'' Lynch added.
The result is a system that clamps down on young offenders.

But the small downturn in juvenile crime may have other causes.

Criminologists point to new ideas in local efforts.

''The problem isn't something the federal government or even states can solve,''
said Sickmund. ''Each community has to come up with its own program. And what
may work in one place won't necessarily work somewhere else.

''One thing is working. Gang members are having truce meetings,'' she said.
''It's not as macho to kill as it once was.''

Detective David Berglund, a juvenile crime specialist with the Los Angeles
Police Department, agrees.

''Based on my experience, churches and community are saying, 'We need to
intercede,' '' he said. ''I also think juveniles are better educated about what
happens if they commit these acts. And communities are getting involved.''

Berglund thinks public outrage is trickling down.

Local governments are using other tools, too. In '96, Los Angeles passed curfew
laws that run from 10 p.m. to sunrise.

''The curfew law is a very effective tool,'' said Berglund. ''It gives police
probable cause to head off crimes, and it helps get runaways back to their
families.''

In the last year, the LAPD has handed out 13,200 curfew citations. And this is
part of a national trend. Arrests for curfew violations increased 21% from '95
to '96 and more than doubled from '92 to '96.

''If you consider just a fraction of those as potential crimes, that's a big
improvement,'' he added.

Another tool being used by communities: old-fashioned truancy laws. California's
San Bernardino County targets truancy by fining parents up to $ 500 for failing
to keep their kids in school.

''The theory is to stop the delinquency problems early,'' said Lynch.

But these downtrends may not last.

Right now, the number of adolescents in the population is at its lowest level in
three decades.  But the youth cohort is expected to grow 8% by the year 2000.
This boom could drive up crime rates as more youths enter the high-crime years
of 14 to 17.

James Alan Fox, professor at Northeastern University in Boston, Mass., calls the
current dip in crime rates the ''calm before the storm.''

Clinton laments kids and crime

BYLINE: Judy Keen

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 397 words

DATELINE: ALBUQUERQUE


President Clinton used a speech attacking Republican opposition to the crime
bill Monday as a pulpit to turn preacher and decry crimes committed by children.

Speaking to the International Association of Chiefs of Police, Clinton lamented
recent high-profile cases of children involved in crime.

Citing the slaying of a 5-year-old Chicago boy, in which two other youngsters
have been charged, Clinton asked, "Who did they come in contact with who taught
them wrong?"

Youthful criminals, he said, "apparently feel no remorse. . . . Where did it
occur to them to hang somebody out of a window in a high-rise? How do they learn
to pick up a gun?

"Where do they know that a fast buck today is better than 10 years or 12 years
or 16 years of hard work and school to make something of yourself?"

Turning to a Virginia incident in which two youngsters set a toddler afire,
Clinton asked, "What about that little kid that was set on fire? Burned over 85%
of his body; 3 years old, not even big enough to do anything wrong. Who taught
those children right from wrong?"

Clinton beseeched the 2,500 law enforcement members at the convention to do
their part to turn kids away from crime.

"Every last citizen in this country has got to do more than look at you and
demand that you do something about crime. We have got to teach our children and
lift them up."

In a speech billed as non-partisan, he attacked Republicans "who just thought it
was important to kill the (crime) bill for political reasons."

"We can't tell the American people they've got to change their behavior to
change this country if crime is a partisan political issue."

Clinton also announced changes designed to make it easier for communities to
hire the 100,000 new police officers funded by the crime bill.

Cities of 50,000 or more can start hiring and training new officers now and
grant funds will be available as soon as they go on the payroll. Smaller towns
will get a one-page, eight-question application to make it easier to apply for
the funds.

Cities try curfews to take time out of crime / Critics say laws punish the
innocent

BYLINE: Deborah Sharp

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 6A

LENGTH: 649 words

DATELINE: MIAMI


In this city and across the nation, parents who can't locate their kids at 11
p.m. may find them in jail - busted for curfew violation.

Frustration with juvenile crime - such as Florida's tourist killings, one of
which involves a 13-year-old suspect - has led to an unprecedented crackdown on
kids. While many welcome the trend, others say rights are being trampled without
hard evidence curfews curtail teen crime.

"It's dealing with a symptom rather than a cause," says curfew critic Donna
Gaines, a Nassau County, N.Y., sociologist and expert on teen violence. "It's
like capital punishment. It doesn't really stop crime. But it makes people think
they're doing something."

In Miami, the Metro-Dade commissioner pushing the curfew disagrees: "People
realize extreme measures are needed to get back control," says James Burke,
whose crusade became personal when he and his wife were held up by a teen gunman
last month.

The Miami law - scheduled for final vote Jan. 18 - echoes similar local curfews
from Dallas to Detroit, to Phoenix to North Arlington, N.J.

Miami's curfew - like many curfews - would be 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. during the week;
midnight on weekends. It applies to youths under 16.

Tampa also is considering a curfew, and Florida's attorney general has proposed
a statewide measure: Parents who knowingly let kids violate the curfew could get
a $ 500 fine and community service.

The American Civil Liberties Union has successfully challenged the laws in
Florida courts and elsewhere. The argument: A whole group is unfairly punished
for the criminal actions of a few.

"A young person has the right to stargaze, or to go fishing at 5 o'clock in the
morning. This places kids under house arrest every night, without benefit of a
trial," says Robyn Blumner, Florida ACLU chief.

Miami Sunset High senior Michael Westlund says the proposed law makes him angry,
but the prospect of breaking his dad's curfew scares him more than any legal
measure:

"When you break your parents' curfew, it's worse," he says. "They don't let up."

Melissa Sickmund of the National Center for Juvenile Justice says of curfews:
"They probably are effective in getting kids off the street. Whether they're
effective in reducing crime, I don't know. If someone is going to commit a
robbery, are they really going to respect a curfew?"

Experts say the recent round of teen curfews is too new to gauge whether they
curb crime. Even so, curfews have gained strong support:

Stung by gang violence, Dallas two years ago passed a curfew nearly identical to
Dade County's. Challenged by the ACLU, the city's position was upheld this month
on appeal. "Nobody says this one law will be the magic weapon," says Dallas
assistant city attorney Don Postell. Other plans: gang intervention and more
jobs and programs for teens.

El Paso resumed enforcing its teen curfew after the Dallas law prevailed in
court: "The police feel it's an effective tool," says Mark Smith of the mayor's
office. "And overwhelmingly, the citizens support it."

Phoenix passed a teen curfew this year as part of a broad attack on juvenile
crime. Under challenge by the ACLU, the law has no hard statistics to prove it
has cut youth crime. But Mayor Paul Johnson says 95% of residents polled
approve. Among parents of kids arrested: 85% approve.

"The neighborhoods truly believe it's making a difference," Johnson says.

Crimes by juveniles up More than 1.6 million people under the age of 18 were
arrested last year for major crimes in the USA, up 11.5%. Juvenile arrests for
some of those crimes:
Crime          1988 arrests   1992 arrests
Murder            1,634           2,463

THORNBURGH FAVORS IDEA OF ENDING STRIKE FORCES

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 2C

LENGTH: 574 words


WASHINGTON - Attorney General Dick Thornburgh says that he is inclined to
abolish the organized crime strike forces operating in 26 U.S. cities but that
he first wants to make sure that such action will not hurt the Justice
Department's fight against the mob.  An advisory committee of U.S. attorneys
recommended that the strike forces be merged with their offices because of
conflicts and duplication of work.  Thornburgh said Friday that strike force
units often ''unnecessarily'' duplicated the work of U.S. prosecutors, sometimes
were staffed with inexperienced lawyers and often ran into conflict with federal
prosecutors.  But before any action is taken to abolish the units, Thornburgh
said, he wants to ''make sure it won't hamper our effort against organized
crime.'' ''It is patently absurd to suggest there's any movement to diminish our
organized crime-fighting activities,'' he said. ''In fact, this will enhance the
effort against organized crime by permitting us to utilize our resources
better.'' As U.S. attorney in Pittsburgh in 1973, Thornburgh was chairman of the
advisory committee when it first went on record as criticizing the strike
forces.  Every year since then, U.S. attorneys have urged attorneys general to
merge or abolish the units, even when strike forces were actively prosecuting
organized crime figures and putting them in jail.  In 1967, Attorney General
Ramsey Clark set up the first strike force of lawyers to focus on the mob in
Buffalo, N.Y. President Richard M. Nixon widely expanded the concept four years
later.  Today, strike force teams are made up of about 131 lawyers nationwide
and backed by FBI agents in 26 cities. Prosecuting their own cases, they have
jailed dozens of organized crime figures, including some of the top bosses.  The
man in charge of the strike forces is David Margolis, chief of the Justice
Department's Organized Crime and Racketeering section. He declined to comment
Friday.  Major strike force offices operate in Boston, Brooklyn, Buffalo,
Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, Kansas City, Las Vegas, Nev., Los Angeles, Miami,
Newark, N.J., New Orleans, Philadelphia and San Francisco.  Smaller operations
are in Atlanta; Fort Lauderdale and Tampa, Fla.; Camden, N.J.; Houston;
Honolulu; Rochester, Minn.; Milwaukee; Providence, R.I.; New Haven, Conn.; and
Rochester and Syracuse, N.Y.

Metro Matters;
Things to Come: As Society Rots, Crime Will Rise

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

Burglars rested on weekends, while murderers worked overtime. About $911 million
worth of merchandise and money was reported stolen; $200 million was recovered.

The New York City Police Department's annual complaint and arrest report for
1986 is bursting with numbers. But nobody had a good answer for the most
disturbing statistic of all: Why is crime going up again?

Maybe the 5.6 percent increase in major crimes reported last year was only a
glitch in the steady annual decline since 1981. If not, then it may signal a
surge that had not been expected for years.

''Scary, isn't it?'' said Dr. Alfred Blumstein, of the School of Urban and
Political Affairs at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh.

The statistics are disturbing for two reasons. First, they underscore problems
of race and poverty that are beyond the capacity of the Police Department to
solve or the willingness of some governments even to address on a sustained
basis.

Also, they appear to defy prevailing wisdom - or at least wisdom that prevailed
a decade ago.

''My expectation,'' Dr. Blumstein said last week, ''was that after the crime
peak of 1980, crime was going to keep going down until the 1990's'' - when the
offspring of baby boomers reached their crime-prone years.

Some officials once assumed smugly that no matter what strategy they pursued -
from placing more police officers on neighborhood patrol to changing the color
of their uniforms - that demographics would prove to be the best weapon against
crime.

''By the 1980's,'' Professor James Q. Wilson said in 1977, ''we are going to
discover the consequences of not having as many children as in the 1960's. There
are not going to be as many young people out there committing crimes.''

Did that mean the crime rate would drop as the number of 20-to-30-year-olds
dipped?

''That's exactly what I'm saying,'' he replied then, ''other things being equal,
of course.''

Professor Wilson, of Harvard and the University of California at Los Angeles,
was correct. Other things have not been equal, and the inequalities keep
growing.

In New York City, young men are committing crime longer than expected (compared
with 10 years ago, teen-agers make up a smaller proportion of all people
arrested for felonies; 20-to-29-year-olds now account for a larger share). Some
evidence suggests that their young successors are committing more crimes, more
serious ones and sooner (the number of juveniles arrested has been declining
since 1981, but the percentage of those arrests resulting in detention has been
rising).

The population of young men is still projected to decline from 1980 to 2000. But
in the last decade of the century the number of 10-to-14-year-olds is expected
to increase slightly.

More significant, New Yorkers are increasingly being born into broken families,
which lessens their chance of lifting themselves out of poverty.

Three-fourths of today's black 20-year-olds were born to married couples, as
were nearly 9 in 10 Hispanic people. But among today's 13-year-olds, fewer than
60 percent of the blacks and fewer than 70 percent of those who are Hispanic
were born to married couples. These groups are likeliest to be poor and to be
both the victims and the perpetrators of crime.

Adam Walinsky, the former chairman of the State Commission of Investigation,
cited those figures in cautioning that it is simplistic to blame the crime
increase simply on the proliferation of crack, the powerful cocaine derivative.

Yes, young people steal to buy drugs, and using drugs further undermines
whatever moral code might otherwise keep them from crime. But Mr. Walinksy calls
drug use both cause and effect of a broader social disintegration, a quiet riot
by ''an unacculturated, unsocialized and indigestible lump of young men.''

If the bulges in last year's police report prove to be the foothills of a
statistical volcano of crime, ''then what we anticipated in the early 90's is
already starting,'' Dr. Blumstein said. ''And the problem is going to be a worse
one in the future,'' he said, because so many children are being born to poor,
unwed mothers. In New York City, where the number of births in 1985 was the
highest in 13 years, the proportion born out of wedlock was double the national
rate.

What all the figures add up to is a firm guess that crime won't go away by
itself. Maybe, though, the statistical bulges can be flattened some if the city
effectively commits its resources to rescuing teen-agers at the margins of
criminal careers and to fulfilling the schools' special responsibilities to the
younger children of broken homes and to their drop-out parents.

To do so means to recognize the serious long-term consequences of relying only
on stopgap responses to problems like foster care and homelessness and rent
subsidies for welfare recipients.

To do otherwise would be a crime.

F.B.I. REPORTS 5% CRIME INCREASE IN 1985, AFTER THREE YEARS OF DECLINE

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to the New York Times

SECTION: Section 1; Part 1, Page 15, Column 1; National Desk

LENGTH: 953 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 26


The number of crimes reported in the United States rose 5 percent last year, the
first increase since 1981, the Federal Bureau of Investigation said today.

According to figures released by the bureau, there were increases in all major
categories of crime. The numbers showed that violent crime, including murder and
rape, was up 4 percent in 1985.

For the second consecutive year, New York was not among the 25 cities with the
worst murder rates. Detroit was No. 1 on the list of cities with populations of
100,000 or more, with 58 murders for every 100,000 residents.

The bureau said it could not explain the overall rise, and experts cautioned
that the figures, which have been criticized in the past for being incomplete,
did not necessarily demonstrate a trend toward increased crime.

The figures were contained in the bureau's annual summary of its Uniform Crime
Reporting program, which gathers crime statistics from nearly 16,000 police
departments and other law-enforcement agencies.

In the past, the program, which the bureau plans to expand and modernize, has
come under attack for providing information only about crimes reported to
law-enforcement agencies. The Justice Department has estimated that two-thirds
of the nation's crime victims do not notify the police.

'The Course Is Clear'

Crime made the largest rise in the South, where it went up 9 percent, the bureau
said. In the Northeast, it said, crime increased by 2 percent. Over all, the
number of crimes committed nationwide rose to 12.4 million in 1985, an average
of 5,200 crimes for every 100,000 people.

''Whatever the reasons for the crime increase last year, the course we must take
is clear,'' William H. Webster, the F.B.I. Director, said in a statement. ''It
is up to all of law enforcement, the criminal justice community and, of course,
each and every citizen to do more.''

According to the 1985 report, ''Crime in the United States,'' violent crime was
32 percent higher than in 1976 but 3 percent below the 1981 level, when crime
hit a record. Property crime was 8 percent below its 1981 level but 7 percent
above the 1976 level.

The overall increase in crime followed three years of decline, the bureau said.
In 1984 there were an estimated 11.8 million crimes, the lowest level since
1978.

Last year, the report said, the number of murders was up 2 percent; forcible
rape, 4 percent; robbery, 3 percent; aggravated assault, 6 percent; burglary, 3
percent; motor vehicle theft, 7 percent, and arson, 3 percent.

A Warning on Predictions

Malcolm M. Feeley, director of the Center for the Study of Law and Society at
the University of California at Berkeley, said that the reported increase in
crime in 1985 does not change an overall trend toward less crime.

''It may simply be,'' he said, ''that the police are getting more efficient in
arresting people.''

The F.B.I. also urged caution in studying the figures and said that last year's
increase ''cannot be used as a predictor of future statistical trends.''

Brian Forst, director of research for the Police Foundation, a research group,
said he believed the increase might be attributed to a growing willingness of
crime victims to notify the police.

''The police had been sort of anonymous for a while,'' he said.''They've been
moving out of patrol cars and onto beats and foot patrols. People are more
likely to report crimes when they feel less alienated toward the police.''

Because of demographic changes, researchers say the overall crime rate should
continue to drop. The number of young men, who are statistically most prone to
crime, has fallen in recent years.

The 368-page F.B.I. study also reported these things:

* There were 8 murders for every 100,000 people in 1985. Increases were recorded
in all areas except the Northeast, where murder declined 2 percent.

* Cities continued to have the worst crime problem. According to the figures,
there were 5,900 reported crimes per 100,000 city-dwellers, as against 1,800
offenses for 100,000 residents of rural areas.

* Nearly one-quarter, or 2.8 million, of the total arrests nationwide in 1985
were for drunkenness or driving while intoxicated.

* Americans lost nearly $2.9 billion in cash and property because of burglary
last year, an average loss of more than $900 per crime.

* One out of every 159 registered motor vehicles was stolen in 1985, and the
national total of 1.1 million was 7 percent above the 1984 level. Automobiles
accounted for three-quarters of the thefts last year.

According to the statistics, Detroit last year replaced Gary, Ind., as the city
with the highest murder rate. Detroit, the numbers showed, had a murder rate of
58 per 100,000 inhabitants, as against 43 in Gary and 41.5 in Richmond, Va.

New York Gun Law Cited

Other cities at the top of the list were St. Louis, with 39 murders per 100,000
people; Newark with 37; Birmingham and Miami, with 34; Flint, Mich., with 31.5,
and Dallas and Fort Worth, with 30.

The murder rate in New York was relatively low, with 19 murders for every
100,000 residents. Michael K. Beard, president of the National Coalition to Ban
Handguns, said the figures indicated that New York's stringent gun-control laws
had been effective.

''New York has taken handguns seriously and you can see the results,'' he said.

Last year, a Federal study group, citing ''extensive criticism'' of the
reliability of the Uniform Crime Reporting program, urged major changes. Bill
Baker, chief spokesman for the bureau, said the bureau hoped to carry out many
of the recommended changes. ''It would bring the program into the 1990's,'' he
said, ''and it's being planned, although there's going to be a budget fight.''

REPORT FINDS PHILADELPHIA CRIME GROUP IN DISARRAY

BYLINE: By WILLIAM ROBBINS, Special to the New York Times

SECTION: Section 1; Part 1; Page 29, Column 1; National Desk

LENGTH: 568 words

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, May 2


This city's crime syndicate is now a mob in disarray, ''possibly leaderless''
after the slaying of six key members, including its latest chieftain six weeks
ago, the Pennsylvania Crime Commission has concluded.

But neither the commission nor other top investigative officials interviewed
here this week take any comfort from that conclusion. The carnage is expected to
continue, and the lucrative criminal activities in which it is rooted have gone
on unabated, they said.

''Significant evidence leads us to conclude that all these murders were tied to
a territorial dispute between New York, New Jersey and Philadelphia crime
syndicates - and that the murders will continue,'' the commission, an
independent state agency, said in its annual report, prepared at its
headquarters in St. Davids, a nearby suburb.

Its current weakened state leaves the Philadelphia organization ripe for a
takeover by a New York crime family, a development that would leave it a fiefdom
with a figurehead to be named as its leader, some investigators here believe.
They note that various members of the Philadelphia organization have long had
ties with both the Genovese and the Gambino crime families of New York.

Atlantic City Viewed as Key

A part of the prize in the territorial dispute, the commission said, ''is
presumed to be control of the lucrative Atlantic City area.''

''Although the casinos may be regulated,'' it said, ''there are many other legal
and illegal ways to make money in their shadows.'' Among those ways,
law-enforcement officials have said, are loansharking and infiltration into
labor unions and service industries.

The latest in the series of murders was that of Philip Testa, who had ascended
to the Philadelphia crime family's leadership less than a year before he was
killed by a bomb last March 15. The series began with the shotgun murder of his
predecessor, Angelo Bruno, on March 21, 1980.

''In the wake of the deaths of six of its key members, the Bruno/Testa La Cosa
Nostra family is now in a possibly leaderless and weakened state,'' the
commission said in its 20-page report to the State Legislature.

Frank Narducci's Role

''I would agree they're in bad shape,'' said Lieut. Frank Wallace, head of the
Philadelphia Police Department's organized crime unit.  ''The top leadership is
dead. The only one left is Narducci.''

But Frank Narducci, known as Chickie, has, Lieutenant Wallace noted, just been
convicted of bribery of an undercover investigator posing as a venal policeman,
and Mr. Narducci is also under indictment on Federal racketeering charges. Mr.
Narducci has been described by investigators as Mr. Testa's third in command.

Similarly hampered by prosecution, investigators say, is Nicodemo Scarfo, also
called ''Little Nickie,'' the man they identify as heading operations in
Atlantic City, which has long been considered the special preserve of the
Philadelphia crime family. Mr. Scarfo was recently convicted in Federal court in
Camden, N.J., of possession of an unregistered firearm.

Mr. Testa's second in command has been named by officials as Peter Casella, but
most of them discount him as a possible new boss because of his age, which is
74.

The persistence of american hate crime; While the number of active hate groups
in the U.S. has fallen, the incidence rate is steady. After Wednesday's mass
shooting in Charleston, S.C., the Washington Post offers context on these crimes
and groups from the Southern Poverty Law Center, the FBI and other sources

SECTION: CONTEXT; Pg. C2

BLACKS MOST LIKELY TO BE TARGETED

FBI hate crime data show that more than 50 out of every one million black
citizens was the victim of a racially motivated hate crime in 2012, the highest
among any racial group. But this is almost certainly an undercount. The FBI is
reliant on state and local law enforcement agencies to categorize and report
hate crimes correctly. Some agencies do a much better job of this than others,
and there is general agreement that the FBI numbers are significantly lower than
they should be.

INCIDENCE RATES STABLE OVER PAST DECADE

The Bureau of Justice Statistics provides the most comprehensive overall count
of hate crime incidents. Their data, drawn from interviews with victims, shows
the number of hate crimes occurring has remained fairly constant over the past
10 years, hovering between 200,000 and 300,000 annually. According to the
Southern Poverty Law Center, the number of active hate groups, which it defines
as "groups have beliefs or practices that attack or malign an entire class of
people, typically for their immutable characteristics," more than doubled from
457 in 1999 to 1,018 in 2011. Since then the number of active groups has
declined to 784.

CONCENTRATED IN DEEP SOUTH, NORTHERN PLAINS

Hate groups aren't distributed evenly by geography. Controlling for the
population in each state, hate groups are concentrated most in the Deep South
and in the Montana/Idaho region. and Vermont/New Hampshire. Vermont has fewer
than 700,000 residents, which combined with its four active hate groups gives it
a high per-capita value. But this might not just be an artifact of low
population. Researchers at Humboldt State University recently mapped geocoded
tweets containing hate speech, and their map does appear to show a high
incidence of hate-tweets originating in Vermont.

BRED BY HARDSHIP

A 2002 review of hate crime literature by Princeton economist Alan Krueger
looked at the economic determinants of hate crime. Krueger concludes that
"rather than economic conditions, the hate crimes literature points to a
breakdown in law enforcement and official sanctioning and encouragement of civil
disobedience as significant causes of the occurrence of hate crimes." Not so
fast, say economists Matt Ryan and Peter Leeson. In 2010 they examined the links
between hate groups and hate crime in the United States. Perhaps surprisingly,
they find the primary determinants seem to be economic. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2015

FBI: violent crime increased in 2015

LENGTH: 314  words


(JURIST) - The FBI on Monday reported an increase in violent crime during 2015
and decrease in property crimes. Crime in the United States, 2015 revealed the
first increase in violent crime in recent years, although property crimes have
been declining each year for over a decade. While the report showed a 3.9
percent rise in violent crime from 2014, the totals for 2015 were lower than
2011 by 0.7 percent, and lower than 2006 by 16.5 percent. Included in the report
was a message from FBI Director James Comey highlighting the necessity of
accurate crime statistics:

We need more transparency and accountability in law enforcement. We also need
better, more informed conversations about crime and policing in this country. To
get there, we are improving the way this nation collects, analyzes, and uses
crime statistics and data about law enforcement`s use of force. Information that
is accurate, reliable, complete, and timely will help all of us learn where we
have problems and how to get better.

The report also unveiled that crime was almost twice as high in the southern US
than in other regions.

The report was released amid a national conversation about police use of force,
as well as conversations about hate crimes in general. Last week the US
Department of Justice (DOJ) opened an investigation into the fatal police
shooting of Terence Crutcher, an unarmed black man who was shot the previous
week by a Tulsa, Oklahoma, police officer. A new report compiled by California
State University, San Bernardino and released earlier this month found an
increase in hate crimes in 2015, particularly against Muslims and
Arab-Americans. In May Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards signed into law an
amended hate crimes bill, referred to as the "Blue Lives Matter" law, including
police, EMS personnel and firefighters in the category of those protected. 2016

Blight Fight | Johnstown ready to take 'drastic' measures as population decline
leaves landscape of empty structures

BYLINE: Dave Sutor, The Tribune-Democrat, Johnstown, Pa.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 679 words


June 14--In the mid-20th century, when steel mills and coal mines drove the
local economy, Cambria County needed housing for more than 200,000 residents.

But those days are long gone.

About 140,000 people live in the county now. Johnstown's population has shrunk
by two-thirds, from more than 60,000 to approximately 20,000.

However, many of the residential units, along with business buildings, still
exist from that heyday. Not all of them are needed, though, so they have been
left to rot, creating a regionwide blight problem.

"We didn't get to this point overnight," Johnstown City Manager Carlos Gunby
said.

"This has been happening over the years. The census tells a big story. And now
we're, unfortunately, at the point where something drastic has to be done."

Owners walk away from properties for many different reasons, including large tax
bills and adult children not wanting to take over homes after their parents die.

The dilapidated structures are not only unattractive, but also threaten the
health and well-being of neighbors, while putting a drag on the economy,
officials say.

"If we were selling a property next to blight, and nobody is keeping care of it,
and it could be hazardous, it would definitely affect the price," said Shannan
Yarnick-Louder, president of the Cambria-Somerset Association of Realtors.

Crime risk

Johnstown has been in Pennsylvania's Act 47 program for distressed
municipalities since 1992.

The population is shrinking and graying, which hurts the tax base.

Infrastructure is crumbling.

Drugs are rampant with out-of-town dealers coming from major East Coast
metropolitan centers and setting up shop, often in run-down rental units.

The city's annual murder rate has been about 30 per 100,000 people in recent
years, rivaling counts in some notorious crime communities, including
Birmingham, Alabama; Oakland, California; and St. Louis.

Along with major crimes, the abandoned properties also provide targets for
criminals who steal copper pipes and other materials.

"It affects us because those abandoned structures offer a prime location for
crimes to be committed, like arson, property crimes, things like that, people
hanging out in them, doing drugs, that type of thing," Johns­town police Chief
Craig Foust said.

Some blight experts question whether razing properties can reduce crime.

"Blight is often used as an excuse to demolish neighborhoods for reasons that
are really not about blight," said award-winning author Roberta Brandes Gratz,
whose latest book is "We're Still Here Ya Bastards: How the People of New
Orleans Rebuilt Their City."

"Let me put it this way," Gratz said, "tearing down neighborhoods does not
remove crime, does not slow down crime.

"Blight and crime are separate issues. You're being unreal if you think the
cause of crime is blight. The crime isn't going to go away. It's going to move."

Poverty problem

Along with those other issues, one-third of Johnstown's population lives in
poverty, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, due, in part, to the presence of
approximately 1,400 filled-to-capacity public housing units and hundreds of
renters using Section 8 vouchers at other properties.

"You've got a high concentration of poverty," said state Rep. Bryan Barbin,
D-Johnstown. "You've got a high concentration of housing units that are
subsidized. You've got a large percentage of abandoned homes. And you've got a
very high percentage of rented versus owner-occupied houses.

"So, if you don't do something positive to get rid of those blighted homes, all
of your other problems become worse."

The problems are not isolated, but rather permeate throughout the surrounding
region, too.

"I certainly think blighted properties create an environment that makes the
decay of the neighborhood," Windber Borough police Chief Rick Skiles said.

Violent and property crime fell again last year, FBI report says

WASHINGTON

The FBI said Monday that violent crime reported to police in 2009 declined for
the third straight year.

The 5.3 percent drop in violent crime was accompanied by a 4.6 percent drop in
property crime, marking the seventh consecutive year that nonviolent crime has
dropped. Each of the violent crime categories decreased from 2008, as did each
of the property crime categories.

Murder fell by 7.3 percent, robbery by 8 percent, aggravated assault by 4.2
percent and rape by 2.6 percent. Motor vehicle theft was down by 17.1 percent,
larceny by 4 percent and burglary by 1.3 percent. The bureau said victims of
property crime, aside from arson, lost an estimated $15.2 billion during 2009.

Data for the FBI's annual crime report comes from 17,985 governmental units and
universities and colleges representing more than 96 percent of the nation's
population.

LOS ANGELES

U.S. holding 324 tons of top-grade uranium

The Energy Department is holding 324 metric tons of bomb-grade uranium at the
same time that the Obama administration is urging foreign nations to reduce or
eliminate their stores of the material, according to a report to be released
today by the nuclear watchdog group Project on Government Oversight.

The Washington-based group wants the administration to declare a part of the
U.S. inventory of highly enriched uranium as surplus and increase the amount
that is blended down each year into commercial reactor fuel. The inventory began
to swell years ago after the U.S. agreed to a series of nuclear arms accords
resulting in the decommissioning of thousands of nuclear warheads.

Florida's SAT scores below national level

Florida high school seniors again scored below the national average on the SAT
college entrance exam, with the class of 2010 scoring slightly lower than 2009
did.

Test results released Monday show Florida students scoring an average of 496 in
critical reading, 498 in math and 479 in writing, out of a maximum 800 points in
each subject. Combined, Florida's score of 1473 was two points lower than the
state scored in 2009 and 37 points below the national combined average of 1509.
The state scored below average in every category.

WALNUT CREEK, CALIF.

A first: Women earn more Ph.D.s than men

Women were awarded more doctorates than men for the first time last year,
according to a study released Monday by the Council of Graduate Schools.

The achievement -- women received 50.4 percent of the doctorates in the U.S. in
2008-09 -- means women dominate every level of higher education from bachelor's
degrees to Ph.D.s. Women have earned more bachelor's and master's degrees than
men since the 1980s, the study found.

WASHINGTON

Melted sea ice forces walruses to hit beach

Tens of thousands of walruses have come ashore in northwest Alaska because the
sea ice they normally rest on has melted. Federal scientists say this massive
move to shore by walruses is unusual in the United States. But it has happened
at least twice before, in 2007 and 2009. In those years Arctic sea ice also was
at or near record low levels.

Scientists are most concerned about the one-ton walruses stampeding and crushing
each other and their smaller calves.

Phila. crime falls, defying U.S. trend

BYLINE: Robert Moran Inquirer Staff Writer

SECTION: Pg. A01

LENGTH: 794 words


While the latest national statistics show an increase in serious crime last
year, Philadelphia not only bucked the trend - cutting crime by 4.2 percent -
but is in a position to reduce it even more.

Through the end of April this year, serious crime is down 5.6 percent compared
with the same period last year, according to Philadelphia Police Department
figures.

"There should be plenty of room for Philadelphia" to see further declines, said
John F. Timoney, former police commissioner and now head of Beau Dietl &
Associates, a New York City security firm.

The recent decline in crime in Philadelphia might be due to the relatively
recent crime-fighting reforms implemented under Timoney, including computerized
crime-mapping and more accountability from district commanders. Timoney's
successor, Sylvester M. Johnson, has embraced those strategies.

Nationally, crime rose 2 percent last year, but the city showed drops in every
major category, including murders, rapes and robberies, according to FBI
statistics released yesterday.

Timoney said he believed cities such as Philadelphia could keep crime numbers
under control.

"The question is: Can you sustain it? I think you can, but you can't take your
eye off the ball," Timoney said.

As the FBI switches its attention away from bank robberies and drug trafficking,
local police will be forced to pick up the slack, Timoney said.

For that, local police will need more money from the federal government, Timoney
said.

James Alan Fox, a criminal-justice professor at Northeastern University in
Boston, agreed that law enforcement needs to stay focused.

"You can't get complacent," he said. "You can't get lulled into thinking, 'This
is simple.' "

But he also sounded a fatalistic note for Philadelphia, suggesting the
rise-and-fall cycle of crime is inevitable.

"Your time will come," he said. "You'll reach bottom one of these days."

When crime statistics began dropping across the United States in the mid-1990s,
Philadelphia, then under the watch of Police Commissioner Richard Neal, lagged
behind.

The nationwide drop was caused by a lessening of the violence associated with
the crack-cocaine trade and other factors, including longer prison sentences, a
robust economy, and fewer young people in crime-prone ages.

By 1998, after Philadelphia had consistently ranked behind New York and other
major cities in its ability to control crime, Neal was out and Timoney had taken
over.

Timoney and Johnson credit smarter policing strategies as the chief reason crime
declined in the 1990s and remains down in Philadelphia and New York.

New York has seen crime go down for eight years and, excluding statistics from
the Sept. 11 attacks, last year trimmed serious crime by 8.5 percent.

Declines in New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington led to a decrease
of 1.2 percent in the Northeast last year.

In Philadelphia, murders dropped from 319 in 2000 to 309 in 2001, a 3.1 percent
decline. Robberies were down 7.9 percent and aggravated assaults were down 5.2
percent.

The city's count of rapes, 1,014 in 2001, was close to the 2000 figure. Still,
Philadelphia is routinely now booking many more rapes than in past years; the
annual figure is more than 50 percent larger than it was five years ago.

Advocates say the change reflects reform in the department's response to sex
crimes: It once labeled large numbers of victims as liars or found other ways to
discount their complaints.

As for property crime, it, too, fell last year. Numbers for burglaries, thefts
and stolen cars all fell by more than 3 percent.

Johnson said aggressive antidrug initiatives over the last several years also
had made a difference.

"A lot of our crime is drug-related," Johnson said.

To explain the uptick in serious crime nationally, experts are pointing to the
nation's economic slump and a surge in the release of prison inmates convicted
during the crack-cocaine epidemic of the late 1980s.

There also has been an increase in the number of young people reaching their
crime-prone years.

And police resources have been diverted since the Sept. 11 attacks to
homeland-defense duty.

"What's going on nationally is clear," said Alfred Blumstein, a professor at the
Heinz School of Public Policy and Management at Carnegie Mellon University in
Pittsburgh. "We're seeing the start of an upward trend."

The first hint that the drop in crime might have bottomed out came in Los
Angeles. Homicides there, which had hit a decades-low count of 428 in 1998,
surged to 548 in 2000. Other cities followed suit last year.

"It couldn't go down to nothing," Timoney said. "But did it have to stop this
soon?"

Canada worse than U.S. in property crime: The most common form of crime in
Canada costs between $4 billion and $10 billion each year.

SECTION: Editorial; A9

LENGTH: 421 words


Property crime is the most common form of crime in Canada, with a rate slightly
higher than in the United States.

Of the three million criminal code violations recorded in Canada in 1996, four
per cent were property offences, 11 per cent were violent crimes, seven per cent
were traffic offences such as impaired driving, and 28 per cent were other
offences such as narcotics and prostitution.

Theft under $5,000 accounts for half the property incidents reported to police.
A quarter of property offences were break-and-enters, 60 per cent of them
residential.

Canada's property crime rate (5,500 offences per 100,000 population) has
remained relatively stable since 1980 with the only significant increases in
1990 and 1991.

Property crimes and their effect on victims are often minimized or viewed
strictly from an economic angle. However, victims of property crime report
feeling that their privacy has been invaded and their sense of safety and
security decreased. Many victims continue to fear recurrence or personal harm
long after the crime, even after property has been replaced or recovered.

Research shows high levels of property crime decrease general quality of life of
a community. As noted in the Vancouver Board of Trade's 1997 study, increasing
property crime ''is a trend that saps the quality of life in Vancouver.''

The estimate of the total cost of property crime in Canada varies greatly. One
study estimated the total cost of crime at between $16.7 and $38.2 billion
annually, with property crime accounting for $4 billion to $10 billion of that
amount. The National Crime Prevention Council estimated property loss accounted
for approximately $5 billion dollars in 1996 out of a total $46 billion cost of
crime.

The average break-and-enter costs between $8,000 and $10,000. The insurance
pay-out in Canada in 1994 on break-and-enters alone was $48 million, compared to
$26 million for fire claims. Insurance companies now pay out more for
theft-related claims than for all other claims combined.

According to the Board of Trade report, Vancouver has not only been the property
crime capital of Canada for the past five years, but its crime rate has been
increasing while other major cities' rates were dropping.

In spite of the common perception of the United States as crime-ridden,
Vancouver's property crime rate was higher than that of comparable west coast
U.S. cities, including Seattle, San Diego, Portland and San Jose.

Serious violent crime dropped 14.3 percent in the Washington area in 1997, and
serious property crimes dropped 10.4 percent, the Metropolitan Council of
Governments announced yesterday.

The total number of serious crimes -- defined as murders, rapes, robberies,
aggravated assaults, burglaries, larcenies and auto thefts -- has been dropping
since 1995 in the Washington area, part of a national trend that has been
strongest in big cities and their suburbs. Last year, the combined rate for all
of these crimes was 47.4 per 1,000 residents in the District and 17 suburban
jurisdictions covered by the COG report. That's down from a high of 56.8 in
1993.

Crime: 'The concern' in '94;
getting tough in '95

BYLINE: Maria Puente

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 2A

LENGTH: 347 words


Scores of new state laws take effect Sunday, and anti-crime measures continue to
be the top priority of fearful Americans and their legislators.

"The public is properly obsessed with safety," says Bob Moffit of the
conservative Heritage Foundation. "Of industrialized countries, the U.S. has the
highest rate of violent crime according to (federal) victimization surveys."

California and Utah have new laws to restrict smoking in public places. Oregon,
Montana and Missouri join other states in limiting campaign contributions to $
100 in state elections.

But legislators shied away from laws dealing with guns, abortions, gays and term
limits. There aren't many new anti-tax laws, though a 10% income tax cut takes
effect in New Jersey.

"Legislators play to public concerns, and crime was THE concern through most of
1994," says Larry Sabato, University of Virginia political analyst.

New measures include:

-- Getting tough on teens: Minnesota, Florida, California and Illinois make it
easier to prosecute juveniles as adults.

-- A "two-strikes-and-you're-out" measure, passed overwhelmingly in Georgia,
imposes life without parole for a second violent offense.

-- New "community notification" laws require telling residents when ex-cons move
in nearby. The most attention went to New Jersey's "Megan's Law," passed after
the killing of 7-year-old Megan Kanka. Charged was a convicted sex offender who,
unknown to the community, moved in across the street.

-- Alabama, Alaska, Maryland, Ohio, Idaho and Utah expand victims' rights to
participate in criminal proceedings.

-- More laws requiring violent criminals to serve at least 85% of jail
sentences. "None of those other laws will work unless you have these
'truth-in-sentencing' laws," says Moffit.

Also new: The federal "motor-voter" law requiring states to allow people to
register to vote when applying for drivers licenses.

But California and at least seven other states are behind in implementing, or
actively resisting, the law - calling it another federal order without money to
carry it out.

Killings rise 3%, despite overall decline in crime rate

BYLINE: Steve Marshall

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 346 words


The number of slayings last year rose 3%, but violent crimes overall edged lower
than in 1992, the FBI reported Sunday.

Still, criminologists and police aren't rejoicing.

Says FBI Director Louis Freeh: "Crime problems are so grave that few Americans
will find much comfort in a small reduction in the overall amount of reported
crime. . . . The nation must find ways to achieve large crime reductions that
are permanent."

"This is the lull before the crime storm that we're going to have in this
country the next decade," says Jack Levin, professor of sociology and
criminology at Northeastern University in Boston.

His reasoning: Homicides by 14- and 15-year-olds are on the rise. These killers
haven't reached the age group - 18 to 24 - that traditionally commits most
murders, Levin says. "What are they going to do for an encore?"

Preliminary findings of the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports, which compile
information on crimes reported to law enforcement agencies nationwide, found
that violent incidents overall declined 1% in 1993.

That means about 1.91 million violent crimes occurred, or about the same number
as in 1991. In 1992, 1.93 million violent crimes were reported.

The 3% increase in murders in 1993 - after a 3.8% drop in 1992 - reflects a
total of about 24,500 slain. About 23,760 were killed in 1992, while a record
24,703 were slain in 1991. Other findings:

-- Property crimes dropped 3%, to about 12.1 million.

-- Burglaries declined 6%, to about 2.8 million.

-- Larceny-theft decreased 2%, to about 7.8 million.

-- Motor vehicle theft dropped 4%, to 1.5 million.

Regionally, violent crimes declined 2% in the Northeast and 1% in the Midwest
and West and remained level in the South.

Crime incidents overall declined 5% in the Northeast, 3% in the Midwest, and 2%
in the South and West.

Part of the reduced crime figures may be attributable to greater citizen
awareness, says the FBI's Harper Wilson.

"We as citizens are a lot more wary about things we do and where we go. We're in
good shape as long as awareness lasts," he says.

NORTH CAROLINA: North Carolina's crime rate rose at three times the national
rate in 1991, leaving Charlotte nearly tied with New York City in per capita
violent crime, state law enforcement officials said Monday.

North Carolina's crime rate rose 9 percent from 1990, compared with the national
increase of 3 percent, said Charles Dunn, the director of the State Bureau of
Investigation. Charlotte ranks 25th among U.S. cities with 2,213 violent crimes
per 100,000 population, compared with 750 nationally and 2,327 for New York,
which ranks 23rd.

"We spent megabucks on bricks and mortar in the inner city to make it nice for
the upper echelons," said City Council member Ella Scarborough. "Now the people
we forgot about are terrorizing us and making it unsafe to go into the buildings
we built."

FLORIDA: Expelled students sue schools. More than two-thirds of the 743 students
tossed out of Florida schools last year were expelled in Orange County. Now,
lawyers for 280 expelled students have filed a class- action lawsuit in Orlando,
which is in Orange County, seeking to force the district to evaluate all
students who might have mental or emotional problems before expelling them for
disciplinary reasons. If the lawsuit is successful, the district may have to
educate emotionally or mentally troubled kids instead of kicking them out for
misbehavior, said a lawyer for Greater Orlando Area Legal Services.

ALABAMA: Taxpayers get bill for office furniture. Alabama's welfare commissioner
billed taxpayers $ 4,715 for two wing chairs, a sofa and a cocktail table last
month while his department was struggling with 5 percent budget cutbacks,
reports said Monday. The items were for Commissioner Charles Cleveland's office.
He said part of the purchase was to replace furniture picked by his predecessor.
"I didn't like the English tea room table; it wasn't functional," said Mr.
Cleveland. "There was a sofa in here before; it just simply was not appropriate
for this office."

FLORIDA: Leak shuts down nuclear reactor. A radioactive water leak from a
primary cooling pump shut down one of Turkey Point's two nuclear reactors near
Miami on Monday, a utility spokesman said. No one was contaminated in the
incident, which was reported to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said Mel
Klein, spokesman for Florida Power & Light Co. The leak occurred in Unit 3,
which went back on line late last year after 11 months of safety upgrades.
Turkey Point's Unit 4 reactor remains operating.

Census Bur study of crime in 13 cities finds NYC residents safest from violent
crimes, following ints with 22,000 residents and 2,000 businessmen in each city
about their experiences with rape, robbery, assault, burglary, larceny, and auto
theft.  Study, financed by Law Enforcement Asst Adm, gives truer picture than
FBI statistics because it is not based on police repts.  Finds that 12 cities,
including NYC, experienced 2 or 3 times more crime than reptd by police.  In
Philadelphia, survey found 5 times more crime than in police repts, lending
weight to accusations by law-enforcement experts that adm of Mayor Frank J Rizzo
falsified crime statistics.Homicide was excluded from study.  Police crime
statistics for homicide, considered most accurate, indicate that Detroit had
48.2 Murders for every 100,000 residents, Chicago had 26.9, Philadelphia had
22.9, NYC had 21.9 And Los Angeles had 17.7. For every 1,000 persons over 12 yrs

Wyoming should adopt hate crimes legislation

From Scott L. Levin

Mountain States regional director, Anti-Defamation League

Denver

We welcome the Wyoming Tribune Eagle's call for the Legislature to take another
look at whether hate crimes laws should be enacted in Wyoming.

It is time for Wyoming to get in step with the 45 other states that have long
ago adopted hate crimes statutes.

The Anti-Defamation League has kicked off a campaign with numerous organizations
called 50 States Against Hate in order to ensure that all states have these
essential tools for countering bias-motivated violence and mitigating its
impact.

Concerns about "thought control" or inhibiting free speech are without merit.
Hate crimes legislation has never been about punishing people for their beliefs
or speech. Rather, it is about punishing people for their criminal actions.

In America, people are free to think and say what they want. In order to be
charged with a hate crime, one must be charged with an underlying crime.

Such statutes typically provide for the imposition of tougher penalties on
criminals who target a person for a crime simply because of a person's race,
religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity or disability.

The Tribune Eagle should be applauded for recognizing the merit of hate crimes
legislation when underlying criminal actions have taken place that are designed
to intimidate or frighten a class of people.

It's time for UW football to move to lower level

From Dick Hughes

Cheyenne

Anyone following college football today realizes the difficulty that schools
such as Wyoming have when competing for players from the south, Florida,
California and Samoa.

Our only Samoan returned to San Francisco two games into his first season. Our
Canadian left a game later on his way back to Vancouver. Nunu, our only
Hawaiian, has grandchildren in Cheyenne.

On a recent weekend, Boise State beat powerhouse Idaho State 52-0. Hawaii at
home beat UC-Davis. All the other 11 schools in our strong conference lost -
lost - by such scores as 55-21, 51-17, 31-14.

Eleven losses!

In a previous letter I proposed forming a new conference with teams such as
Montana, North Dakota, Eastern Washington, North Dakota State etc.

Perhaps I shot too high. Maybe Idaho State and Northern Colorado would be
better.

Also maybe an athletic director who would find someone Wyoming could beat on
opening day?

Let's face it, the good old days are gone forever as far as football goes. It is
time to continue building a fine university and play football, if at all, with
other little guys.

Join in the fight against the feds' war on coal

From M. Lee Hasenauer

Cheyenne

The Cheyenne tea party rally of Sept. 17 has done its job.

The governor's office called me and said they were impressed. They are
encouraging we, the people, to try to find a legislator to fulfill the petition
request to bring a bill this 2016 legislative session that would implement the
10th Amendment, states' rights, to stop the EPA's war on coal and save Wyoming
jobs.

The Wyoming coal industries were there and support our efforts.

Will you patriotic friends contact all legislators in energy counties or find me
one who is interested in fighting the EPA's war on coal?

Need medical care? You might try Fort Collins

From Janelle Ebben

Carpenter

As a Type 1 diabetic, I have a weakened immune system. I came down with a severe
sore neck/throat, fever and body aches. So much so that even drinking water was
painful.

First trip, a local health center. They checked for several possible conditions,
were cordial, but ultimately they could not pinpoint the pain. As it worsened, I
visited Cheyenne Regional Medical Center's emergency room.

After three hours with a nurse practitioner, they determined there was nothing
wrong with me and their suggestion: "gummy vitamins."

Next the endocrinologist, who discovered my extreme dehydration. After three
bags of saline and genuine concern, he suggested a Cheyenne ear, nose and throat
specialist.

After two and a half hours in the waiting room, the specialist proceeded to
scope my throat. His exact quote: "In 22 years of being an ENT, I've never seen
anything like that before!"

But rather than investigate the rarity, he offered some antibiotics, and if it
gets worse, come back.

Frustrated, I called my dentist in Fort Collins, Colorado. He recommended an
ear, nose and throat specialist in Fort Collins who, after hearing my story, got
me in immediately.

After five minutes in the waiting room, and five-minute examination and a throat
scope, I was told I had "hand, foot and mouth disease." I got the correct
medicine, including pain relief that finally allowed me to eat. He typed a
letter to my endocrinologist, immediately explaining his findings.

The whole ordeal lasted three weeks and could have been fixed in 10 minutes.

The final insult, the bill.

My insurance was charged $295 at the clinic, $1,600 at the emergency room, $860
at the Cheyenne specialist and $1,600 for two trips to the endocrinologist.

I commend the clinic and the endocrinologist for their efforts and compassion,
but I was billed over $2,400 from the other two to tell me there was nothing
wrong with me.

The bill at the Fort Collins office? $420 for the exact same care and the
solution.

After insurance, my total Cheyenne bill? $1,705.

Bill from Fort Collins? $95.

Next time you are seriously ill, my advice is: Head south.

Whoever stole the lawn chairs should return them

CRIME maps showing where and how often offences are committed could be seen on
the internet from next month.

The Met is currently testing electronic crime mapping software and plans to
launch the system in September, after a technical review.

Interactive maps will sit alongside monthly crime statistics published on the
Met police website and will provide details of the number, rate and geographical
location of defined crime types on a ward, borough and pan-London basis.

A test map can be viewed online at maps.met.police.uk.

By clicking on a borough, you can see the figures for burglary, robbery and
vehicle crime and comparison figures from previous years.

According to the map the crime rate in the Bromley, Lewisham and Greenwich
boroughs is average for London.

And Bexley is below average.

Crime maps have been used in the US - notably in Chicago, New York and Los
Angeles - where police departments show incidents at a house-to-house level.

News Shopper went to Burnt Ash Hill in Lee - the scene of the murder of teenager
Jimmy Mizen on May 10 - to find out what people think about crime maps.

Oakland 4th most perilous U.S. city

BYLINE: By Kelly Rayburn STAFF WRITER

SECTION: LOCAL; News; Oakland-Berkeley; Alameda; My Town

LENGTH: 621 words


Oakland was ranked the fourth most dangerous city in the United States this week
by a controversial but closely watched private-research group that publishes a
list of the country's most dangerous cities annually. Nearby Richmond came in at
No. 9.

Oakland jumped four spots, from No. 8 last year, in this year's "City Crime
Rankings: Crime in Metropolitan America," which was published by CQ Press, a
unit of Congressional Quarterly Inc.

"Obviously, it's not something we can ignore," said City Council President
Ignacio De La Fuente. "I think that unfortunately, let's face it, we have not
been able to deal with some of the main sources of crime."

De La Fuente said city officials did not do enough over the past 12 months to
attack the problem.

"I don't think we've done a very good job, collectively," he said, "that's the
mayor, that's the chief of police and that's the council. ... We have increasing
crime in neighborhoods that have historically been safer than they are today."

Detroit earned the dubious title of most dangerous city in America. It was
followed by St. Louis and Flint, Mich.

After Oakland, at No. 4., came Camden, N.J.; Birmingham, Ala.; North Charleston,
S.C.; Memphis, Tenn.; Richmond; and Cleveland. Landing in the top 10 in the 2007
rankings, which were based on the Federal Bureau of Investigation's crime data
for 2006, is not shocking for Oakland.

"We don't need a poll to tell us that public safety is the No. 1 issue in the
hearts and minds of Oakland residents and the top priority for the mayor's
administration," said Paul Rose, a spokesman for Mayor Ron Dellums.

He attacked the credibility of the report, which was released on Sunday.

"The FBI questions the use of the statistics, which forces many to question the
validity of such a poll," he said.

Indeed, criminologists and law enforcement across the country pan the
most-dangerous cities list when it is published every year. This year, the
report looked at 378 cities with at least 75,000 people. Its conclusions were
based on per-capita rates for homicide, rape, robbery, aggravated assault,
burglary and auto theft.

Each crime category was considered separately and weighted based on its
seriousness, CQ Press said. The report's findings were compiled by Kathleen
O'Leary Morgan and Scott Morgan, whose Morgan Quitno Press published the annual
list until it was acquired by CQ Press.

The details of the weighting system are kept secret. In a company statement, CQ
Press acknowledged that its lists are seen as controversial. The statement said
there are indeed differing reasons for crime levels from city to city. But it
said that shouldn't preclude people from comparing different cities' overall
crime rates.

"This would be somewhat akin to deciding not to compare athletes on their speed
in the 100-year dash because of physical or training differences," CQ Press'
statement said. "Such differences help explain the different speeds but do not
invalidate the comparisons."

In Oakland, police Chief Wayne Tucker said people might be misled by the report.

"The department is always interested in how we're being rated," he said, "but I
think a rating can be very deceptive."

He said being ranked fourth on the list of dangerous cities could easily lead
people to believe the whole city is under siege from crime. Tucker said the
reality is that crime is concentrated in "two reasonably small areas" in East
and West Oakland. He said, thus far in 2007, crime is up overall by about 2
percent, attributing that to increases in residential burglaries and domestic
violence. Homicide is down this year compared to last. There have been 111
homicides so far this year, compared to 134 at this point in 2006, when Oakland
finished the year with 148.

Homicides, gun use rise;
But violent crime rate overall is level, U.S. says

BYLINE: From news services

SECTION: MAIN; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 360 words


WASHINGTON -- Though the overall violent crime rate in the U.S. remained
unchanged last year, the rates of homicide and firearm violence jumped,
according to a U.S. Justice Department report.

The National Crime Victimization Survey, released Sunday, found that,
nationwide, murders increased 4.8 percent in 2005, with the highest increases in
the Midwest, at 5.8 percent, and South, at 5.3 percent.

Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty said one year's data was not enough to
indicate a change in a decade-long trend of declining violent crime. The rates
of violent crime and property crime in 2005 were the lowest since the survey
began in 1973.

Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, said
police chiefs from around the country have reported that the increase in violent
crimes first seen in 2005 has continued into this year, with jumps in homicides,
robberies and aggravated assaults.

Law-enforcement officials called on the federal government to refocus its
efforts on fighting violent crime and suggested that international
anti-terrorism efforts had sapped crime-fighting efforts. In response, Attorney
General Alberto Gonzales said cities would have to work harder to fight the
increase in violence and should not count on increased federal assistance.

Nevertheless, Gonzales arranged a private meeting in New York last Thursday with
three state police executives and the police chiefs of Los Angeles, Miami and
Providence, R.I. One of them, Providence's Dean Esserman, came away "impressed
at how much he listened. ... He could have used the time to preach; instead he
used it to hear our concerns."

Esserman said all but a few cities have fewer police officers now than in 2001
"because of the loss of federal money."

"I believe in homeland defense, but I also believe in crime fighting," Esserman
said. "I don't want one neglected for the other. Every year we're losing 16,000
people to murder, mostly young people and mostly killed by guns, and that's more
than three times the number that died at the World Trade Center" in the Sept. 11
attacks.

This report includes information from the Los Angeles Times and the Associated
Press.

Berrien County Crime Stoppers marks 20 years

BYLINE: By MELISSA WEST; Tribune Staff Writer

SECTION: LOCAL; Pg. D1

LENGTH: 657 words


Crime, so the saying goes, does not pay.

But, for the past two decades, a call to the Berrien County Area Crime Stoppers
has.

Since its inception in 1983 as an affiliate of the South Bend Area Crime
Stoppers, the not-for-profit agency has paid out more than $133,000 in cash
rewards for tips on unsolved felony cases, Sgt. Tina Morrow of the Berrien
County Sheriff's Department crime prevention unit said.

In that time, more than 1,850 cases in Berrien County were solved, more than
1,650 arrests were made, and nearly $2.7 million in narcotics and stolen
property were seized thanks to anonymous tips.

One of the more recent high-profile cases solved because of a Crime Stoppers'
tip was the string of home invasions targeting elderly residents in Berrien and
Cass counties in Michigan and St. Joseph County in Indiana.

"Due to one person calling, 16 cases were solved, and a total of four suspects
were arrested," Morrow said.

The first Crime Stoppers program was launched in 1976 by a police detective in
Albany, N.Y.

Morrow, who has coordinated the Berrien County program for the past three years,
said the program combats two major problems investigators face when trying to
solve a crime. By allowing tipsters to remain anonymous, Crime Stoppers
eliminates the fear some have of getting involved. And, by offering cash rewards
for good tips, it draws out information from people who might otherwise be
apathetic to whether a crime is solved.

"This is a wonderful program and a great opportunity for citizens to get
involved and to help law enforcement keep their communities safer," Morrow said.

Capt. Jim Merriman, who has been with the Niles Police Department for nearly 25
years, appreciates the information Crime Stoppers has forwarded to his
department through the years.

"Sometimes cases get to a point you have no more leads to go on," Merriman said.
"Then you get a call from Crime Stoppers, and it opens up again, many times to a
very good conclusion.

"We certainly get good information from it, and it solves a lot of crimes that
might have been unsolvable."

Callers are assured complete anonymity, Morrow said. No caller identification
devices are used, and tipsters are not pressured into revealing their name.

"Sometimes I actually argue with people because they want to give me their
name," Morrow said.

When tipsters call, she explained, they are assigned a confidential code number.
The date, time and a brief summary of their tip is logged. Callers are told to
check the status of the case by calling back in three or four weeks.

The tips are then forwarded to the appropriate law enforcement agencies, who
follow up on and report back to Crime Stoppers with details on their
investigation, Morrow continued. If an arrest is made or criminal charges are
filed, arrangements are made to pay the tipster when he or she calls back.

Rewards are determined by the program's 15-member board and are based on what
kind of crime was solved, how many were arrested, whether it led to the solving
of other cases and the amount of narcotics or stolen property found, Morrow
said. The maximum reward amount is $1,000.

All the money to pay rewards comes from donations from the public. The Berrien
County program also holds one major golf outing every June at Indian Lake Hills
Golf Course in Eau Claire. This year's outing was the program's largest yet,
attracting 177 golfers and raising $7,000.

"All the money that's raised goes into Berrien County cases," Morrow said.

She says future plans for the program include modifying and expanding its
Student Crime Stoppers program in area schools.

The student version is similar to the original Crime Stoppers program except
that misdemeanor tips are also taken and all information is forwarded first to
the school principal. The program was launched in February 2001 and is active in
15 schools in eight Berrien County school districts.

Slight nudge up in Tampa crime reverses trend

BYLINE: ANGELA MOORE

SECTION: CITY & STATE; Pg. 4B

LENGTH: 534 words

DATELINE: TAMPA



Tampa's crime rate increased slightly in 2000, ending a downward trend started
in 1996.

Then again, because 1999's crime rate was the lowest since 1984, the increase
was not a complete surprise.

The Tampa Police Department keeps track of auto theft, larceny, burglary, rape,
aggravated assault, robbery and murder. According to the department's
statistics, the total was up 5 percent from 1999.

Driving up 2000's overall rate were larcenies, which increased by 12.4 percent.

Although the difference between 1999 and 2000 could be described as negligible,
especially considering the soaring crime rate of the early 1990s, Tampa Police
Chief Bennie Holder said any increase is a concern.

"I certainly hope that it's not a trend," Holder said. "I'm disappointed that we
had any increase at all, although I am happy that violent crime is down."

Violent crimes include murder, rape, aggravated assault and robbery. In 1999,
Tampa had 31 murders. In 2000, there were 38, an increase of 22.6 percent. But
consider 1994, when there were 62, or 1986, when there were 79, and 2000's total
doesn't look that bad.

"Homicides are one of those things that really catches everybody's attention,"
Holder said. But other statistics tell the whole story.

Auto thefts, which peaked at 11,011 in 1994, were down to 5,772 in 2000. That's
slightly more than the 5,740 in 1999.

The crime rate is a number determined by comparing the number of crimes reported
- 33,666 in Tampa in 2000 - against the population. In 2000, Tampa's crime rate
was 113 crimes committed per 1,000 people. For 1999, the rate was the lowest in
15 years, or 108 crimes per 1,000 people.

According to statewide data for 1999, Tampa's crime rate was nearly twice as
high as the state's overall rate. Although not yet available for 2000, state
figures from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and national statistics
from the FBI are usually released in the next two months.

Holder said comparing Tampa's crime rate against other cities in the state or
nation is not pertinent to the department's goal of fighting crime at home.

"I really hate to compare one city to the next," Holder said. "You have to look
at the demographics of every city, the economic condition of the community."

Holder also emphasized that tourists and good weather make Tampa's crime rate
higher than that of northern cities.

"Who wants to go commit a crime when it's 32 below (zero) and there's 3 feet of
snow on the ground?" he said.

Indeed, Tampa's crime rate in 1997 put it in the top five nationally, along with
Orlando and Miami, Atlanta and Topeka, Kan.

"The most important thing to me is to see how we can improve from one year to
the next, comparing Tampa against Tampa," Holder said.

The increase in Tampa's crime rate coincides with the recent economic downturn.

During the economic recession of the early '90s, the crime rate soared, reaching
its peak in 1994. But Holder said if the economy turns that sour again, Tampa
police are ready.

"I don't think we'll see a repeat of what happened in the early '90s," Holder
said.

"We have a more aggressive apparatus for fighting crimes within the community
than we did then."

Linking Drop in Crime to Rise in Abortion

BYLINE: By ERICA GOODE

SECTION: Section A; Page 14; Column 4; National Desk

LENGTH: 1217 words


No one is certain why crime rates have plummeted in the United States over the
last decade. But that fact has not prevented politicians from gleefully taking
credit for the downturn, or academics from ruminating endlessly on its causes.

The newest theory about why crime is down, however, put forward in a report by
two highly regarded economists, is drawing both outrage and intense debate --
even before the full report has been published or subjected to peer review.

In the report, Dr. John J. Donohue 3d of Stanford Law School and Dr. Steven D.
Levitt of the University of Chicago contend that a large share of the drop in
crime in the 1990's -- perhaps as much as half -- can be attributed to the sharp
increase in abortions after the Supreme Court ruling in Roe v. Wade in 1973.

Fewer crimes are being committed now, the researchers say, because many of the
children who might have grown up to commit those crimes were never born. Within
a few years of the Roe v. Wade decision, which established a constitutional
right to abortion, up to a quarter of pregnancies ended in abortion, statistics
show.

Dr. Donohue and Dr. Levitt base their thesis on economic analyses of crime rates
from 1985 to 1997, examined as a function of abortion rates two decades before.

The timing of the decline in crime, they found, coincided with the period when
children born shortly after the Roe v. Wade decision would be reaching the late
teen-age years -- the peak ages for criminal activity.

States that were the first to legalize abortion, Dr. Donohue and Dr. Levitt
found, including New York, Washington, Alaska and Hawaii, were also the first to
experience a decrease in crime. For example, in states that legalized abortion
in 1969 or 1970, the researchers found, the cumulative decrease in crime from
1982 to 1997 was greater than for the rest of the nation. The decrease in murder
was 16.2 percent greater, the decrease in violent crime over all was 34.4
percent greater, and the decrease in property crime was 35.3 percent greater.

Also, states with the highest abortion rates, the researchers found, had larger
reductions in crime than states with low abortion rates.

The most likely explanation for these findings, the researchers assert, is that
abortion has occurred selectively, decreasing the number of children likely to
commit crimes as adults.

"Most of the reduction," Dr. Levitt and Dr. Donohue write, "appears to be
attributable to higher rates of abortion by mothers whose children are most
likely to be at risk for future crime." Teen-agers, unmarried women and black
women, for example, have higher rates of abortion, the researchers note, and
children born to mothers in these groups are statistically at higher risk for
crime in adulthood.

The economic benefit to society of abortion in reducing crime, the researchers
suggest, "may be on the order of $30 billion annually."

The conclusion of the report, a draft of which was posted on a Web site of the
Social Science Research Network, is not a popular one. When it was reported in
The Chicago Tribune on Aug. 8, it provoked angry op-ed columns, tirades on radio
talk shows and expressions of indignation by groups on both sides of the
abortion divide.

And the economists have been accused of everything from promoting eugenics to
recommending abortion as a means to reduce crime.

"It takes great skill to simultaneously infuriate the right and the left," said
Dr. Alfred Blumstein, an expert on crime rates and University Professor at the
Heinz School of Carnegie Mellon University, observing the ferocity of the
response.

In a news release, Joseph Scheidler, executive director of the Pro-Life Action
League, called the study "so fraught with stupidity that I hardly know where to
start refuting it."

"Naturally, if you kill off a million and a half people a year," Mr. Scheidler
said, "a few criminals will be in that number. So will doctors, philosophers,
musicians and artists."

Frances Kissling, president of Catholics for a Free Choice, an organization
based in Washington, commented that even if the report's findings were right,
"the question in a certain sense is, 'So what?'

"I don't think it has any policy implications whatsoever," Ms. Kissling said.
"Abortion is a profoundly private decision" that women make based on "their own
lives and circumstances," and not public benefit.

And in a recent column, Carl Rowan wrote, "I've seen a lot of far-fetched and
dangerous ideas passed off as 'social research,' but none more shallow and
potentially malicious than the claim that the drop in crime in the United States
can be attributed to legalized abortions."

Dr. Blumstein and other criminal justice experts acknowledged that the
economists may well have demonstrated that abortion rates have had an effect on
crime, though until the paper is published and subjected to academic scrutiny,
they said, it is difficult to assess the findings.

But they expressed skepticism that abortion's effect on crime was as great as
Dr. Donohue and Dr. Levitt posited. Declining crime rates, Dr. Blumstein said,
appear to be the result of many complicated factors, including the dwindling of
the crack cocaine epidemic, an improved economy, greater job opportunities for
low-income youth and the steady growth of the prison population.

Changing attitudes among teen-agers and innovative policing strategies may also
be contributors, other experts said.

"These are very able guys," Dr. Blumstein said of Dr. Donohue and Dr. Levitt,
"and I'm prepared to believe that they've discerned an effect. But I think
they've gone too far in claiming that it can account for half of the decline,
when there are a multitude of effects going on that are much more proximate to
the situation."

Dr. David J. Garrow, a historian at Emory University and author of "Liberty and
Sexuality" (University of California Press, 1998), a history of the abortion
debate, called the economists' theory "interesting and original." But he
questioned the researchers' knowledge of abortion history and was skeptical of
the usefulness of the report.

"The policy implication of this paper is that if you renewed Medicaid funding
for abortion at the Federal level, you'd dramatically reduce crime 17 years from
now," Dr. Garrow said. "But are we going to find any interest group in America
that is going to make that argument? No. Neither side in the debate wants to
touch it with a 10-foot pole."

For his part, Dr. Levitt said in an interview that the research was "by no means
a complete explanation" and that he and Dr. Donohue were aware that "the world
is complicated." He added that they did not intend their work to influence
public policy. "Our paper should have little to no impact on any policy
regarding abortion," Dr. Levitt said.

"There's nothing in our paper that either indirectly or directly suggests that
we condone denying anyone the right to have children if they want to have
children," Dr. Levitt added. "We've been accused of having a eugenic agenda and
it just is not an accurate appraisal of what we're doing at all. If anything,
what our paper says is that when you remove a government prohibition against a
woman choosing, the woman makes choices that lead to better outcomes for her
children."

In crime war, the South is still lagging

BYLINE: Martin Kasindorf

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 4A

LENGTH: 661 words


When it came to taking a bite out of crime last year, most regions
of the country were Rottweilers. The South was a Chihuahua.

From a car-theft epidemic in Macon, Ga., to an inexorably rising
homicide count in Washington, D.C., preliminary FBI statistics
for 1996 mark many Southern cities as laggards in combating crime.

Louisville reported sizable increases in robbery and in the principal
FBI categories of property crime: burglary, theft and vehicle
theft. San Antonio suffered a 15% rise in larceny, including shoplifting
and purse-snatching.


Crimes against property were up 2% in the South. By comparison,
they were down 8% in the West. The South's 2% decline in reported
violent crime was a pale shadow of the nearly double-digit drops
recorded elsewhere.

"The murders the South specializes in are not the crime-in-the-streets
kind that respond to zero-tolerance policing," University of
North Carolina sociologist John Shelton Reed Jr. says. "The South
has had far more than its share of domestic arguments, fights
between neighbors or friends -- the things people write country
songs about. These, I suspect, are going to hang in there."

Criminologists say there is a Southern culture of violence, whether
it's caused by the legacy of the old dueling code or simply by
the heat.

"There are guns owned by more people, and an apparent willingness
to resolve dispute through force," says James Fox, dean of the
college of criminal justice at Boston's Northeastern University.
About a third of Americans live in the South, but the region has
42% of U.S. homicides, Fox says.

Notwithstanding Washington's 10% increase in homicides, crimes
of violence actually declined last year in most large Southern
cities. Houston's 19% improvement in the homicide rate typified
the trend. But as Louisville found, newly meek criminals simply
turned to less confrontational wrongdoing. "When we put more
pressure on violent crimes like robberies, we see a lot of criminals
going to property crimes like residential burglaries," says Aaron
Graham of the Louisville Police Department.

Miscreants in affluent Plano, Texas, 18 miles north of Dallas,
prefer relatively low-risk "open-garage type" burglaries and
shoplifting from mall businesses, Officer Carl Duke says. Police
say Plano's problems are rising in pace with its burgeoning growth
to a population of 185,000. "Everything seems to be moving this
way," Duke says.

If a single reason has to be pinpointed for rising property crimes
in the South, it's a simple one, Reed says: "There's more stuff
to steal." The regional economy is "coming on strong," creating
about half of the nation's new jobs, Reed says.

"There's a striking correlation between the wealth of states
and their burglary rates," he says. Per capita income in the
South, once half that of Northern places, is now more than 90%
of the national average.

In some respects, the inland South is merely catching up with
trends now past their peaks in coastal metropolises. "Locked
between the two coasts, we just began to see an increase in drug
trafficking and individual drug usage, mostly with crack," Louisville's
Graham says. "We're also beginning to see an increase in gang
activity."

Some of the more startling FBI statistics can be misleading. Grand
Prairie, Texas, a Dallas neighbor city of 126,000, reported a
63% spike in its violent crime rate. But much of this was accounted
for by an 85% increase in reported aggravated assaults, from 515
incidents in 1995 to 956 last year. There's no more assaults than
before, Officer Ron Siebert says; police just have a new policy
of arrests in domestic violence cases they once winked at.

"We used to tell the husbands to go away," Siebert says. "It
used to be that women were never the violent ones, but now we
can put women in jail, too.

"Instead of just walking away, we're going ahead and filing."

Crime dips: Apprehension hangs tough

BYLINE: Jack Kisling

SECTION: DENVER & THE WEST; Pg. B-07

LENGTH: 710 words


Well, here comes another one of those bona fide, certified, consecrated surveys,
chockful of incontestable evidence - the kind that gives cold, hard fact a bad
name.

Yes, I'm talking about the crime-rate report put out by the FBI. The figures for
1995 are complete, and they show that crime fell in every category and in every
region of the country, with the sharpest drop (4 percent) reported in the
Northeast. In the Midwest it declined 2 percent, and in the South and West it's
down 1 percent.

1995 marked the fourth straight year that violent crime has declined nationwide.
The decline for all violent crimes was 4 percent, led by the murder rate with an
8 percent decline.

Crime is down even in Colorado. Denver reported a drop of nearly 2 percent,
Lakewood showed a 5 percent dip, and Aurora had a decline of 7.5 percent.

Big cities - New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and others with more than a million
people - showed the largest decline, 6 percent. A drop of at least 10 percent
was reported in 24 other big cities, led by Tampa, Fla., with a 20 percent
decline. Some smaller cities of 500,000 or more showed an increase of 1 percent,
and rural counties reported a 3 percent crime increase.

In general, then, the bigger the town, the more crime has declined.

Such news is always awkward, since it tells only what has happened, rather than
what we all think has happened. It obliges experts, law enforcers and
politicians to point with pride and view with alarm. In this case the viewing
with alarm is widespread concern that the decline trend obscures a serious
increase in teenage violence.

A Florida congressman, commenting on the FBI report, said: "We shouldn't be
lulled into a false sense of security."

OK, congressman. I promise that I won't be lulled.

I believe I can do this, because I haven't yet been lulled into a false sense of
security about airline travel by 30 years of statistical harping on how many
thousand times safer it is to fly than to go by car. If I can cling so
stubbornly and irrationally to my belief that the best way to fly is on wings of
your own, why should I suddenly have a big sigh of relief about the recent
slight dip in the vast tide of crime?

About all it tells me is that it is a little less dangerous to walk America's
mean streets this year than it was last year. But a little birdie tells me it is
still pretty damned dangerous out there, and I'm guessing that the world
contains a lot more little birdies than statisticians. (Are there any statistics
on this?)

One little birdie with an eagle eye for worm holes is Alfred Blumstein,
criminologist and adviser to the Justice Department. Picking a slight upturn in
larceny in the otherwise cheery FBI report, Blumstein sees in it potential for a
crime explosion by the century's end.

Larceny - stealing, shoplifting, etc - is the crime with the youngest criminals.
Its perpetrators' peak ages are 15 and 16, and an increase in this category,
says Blumstein, signals a surge in teenage crime novices who will, by 2005 when
there will be 30 percent more juveniles around, graduate on up to burglary,
robbery and so on.

Another worm hole is the teenage murder rate, which grew 22 percent between 1990
and 1994. With a teen population expected to grow 17 percent in the next decade,
our little birdies are putting 2 and 2 together and telling us to prepare to see
more teenage murderers.

Criminologist James Allen Fox calls the current crime rate the calm before the
storm. Anticipating the coming deluge of teenagers, he says of the current lull:
"It won't last much longer." Wise birdies will probably agree.

Wise birdies might even add that when it comes to kid crime we ain't seen
nuthin' yet. Sure, we've seen headlines of preteen armed robbers and rapists, of
grade-school gangs, of a 6-year-old savage severely beating an infant and other
indications that crime creeps ever closer to the cradle, but these horror
stories aren't yet numerous enough to make much of a statistical impact.

Now that we have had a 7-year-old kid try to pilot an airplane across the United
States, how much longer will it be until a a 7-year-old tries to hijack one?

Pondering crime's impact on every corner of society

BYLINE: Cathy Hainer

SECTION: LIFE; Pg. 3D

LENGTH: 772 words


Crime is a hot-button issue this election year. The major newsweeklies
have all tackled the subject. Now special-interest magazines are
taking their turn.

SOUTHERN VICE: The Oxford American, a sort of Atlantic Monthly
of the South, has released a special double issue devoted to crime,
and it's a standout. Is crime in the South so different from crime
in New England or the Northwest? Not really. There are rapes and
robberies in Maine just like there are in Mississippi. But the
South has greater stereotypes to overcome. The specter of "the
gracious Old South of . . . chain gangs and carnivorous sheriffs
in Ray-Bans . . . where violence was always bubbling on someone's
back burner" still terrifies Northern liberals, reports Hal Crowther.
Also, the South is the most crime-ridden area of the country in
many categories, including murder, rape and burglary, reports
Dave Shiflett.

Overall, Oxford American avoids the statistics and approaches
crime with odd but interesting human-interest stories, like Florence
King's essay on how crime is affecting the arts. Sister Helen
Prejean contributes a piece on working with death-row inmates
and visiting the set of Dead Man Walking, which is based
on her book. Southern writers Clyde Edgerton and Donna Tartt contribute
short stories. Even the dining review addresses the issue by looking
at how rampant neighborhood crime is changing the New Orleans
dining scene.

The centerpiece of the issue is Dennis Covington's report on "The
Kentucky Race Murder of 1995." In the small town of Guthrie,
a rowdy 19-year-old named Michael Westerman was shot by a black
teen-ager. Interestingly, Tony Horowitz reported on the same story
for the March 18 issue of The New Yorker. Both draw the
same sad conclusion, summed up by a Guthrie resident: "There's
going to be a race war. It's gonna start in Guthrie. I don't know
where it's gonna end up at." (Six issues, $ 24; 800-269-6926.)

SOUTHERN VICE II: The April Emerge also looks at racial crime,
specifically the recent torchings of black churches in the South.
In a rampage reminiscent of the civil-rights movement years, no
fewer than 17 black churches have been destroyed in the last year.
(10 issues, $ 18.95; 800-888-0488)

ANTI-GAY VIOLENCE: In the April Out, writer and gay activist Michelangelo
Signorile re-

ports on how a bungled robbery-turned-murder in Oregon has focused
attention on the controversial labeling of "hate crimes." The
issue, in fact, has split the gay and lesbian community. Anti-violence
activists are pushing for crimes against homosexuals to be legally
classified as hate crimes for two reasons, reports Signorile.
First, to keep a record of anti-gay violence, and second, to seek
more severe punishment for these crimes. Ironically, many gays
and lesbians believe violent crimes motivated by hate should not
get heavier penalties because that would play into their antagonists'
belief that minority groups are getting "special treatment."
But Signorile calls that stance silly. "It is, after all, activists'
duty to exploit every opportunity to advance their message about
homophobia, and to open people's minds." (10 issues; $ 19.95;
800-876-1199.)

TERRORISM BILL: The March 25 issue of the recently redesigned
Nation tackles crime on an international scale, namely terrorism.
April 19 is the anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing, and
Clinton is sure to press the Republicans on their "failure"
to pass an anti-terrorism bill, writes David Cole. But, he ponders,
would an anti-terrorism bill "alter the constitutional balance
between government power and personal freedom"? Those in favor
of increasing governmental power to fight terrorism put forth
two main arguments. One, that terrorism has been taken up by religious
groups and cults who "don't abide by our bounds." Two, that
technological advances have made chemical, even nuclear, weapons
more widely available. But, says Cole, let's put the matter in
perspective. After all, more than 20,000 people are murdered in
the USA every year, yet Congress has passed only "symbolic"
gun control measures. "Thus we knowingly tolerate many conditions
that pose far greater risk of harm to ourselves than terrorism."

Bowers defends comments on crime

BYLINE: Maria Elena Fernandez; STAFF WRITER

SECTION: STATE NEWS; Pg. 01A

LENGTH: 258 words


Georgia Attorney General Michael Bowers said today he stands by comments he made
that Atlanta's streets are more dangerous than a war zone, citing FBI crime
statistics he compiled last month.

Bowers made the statements Monday at an Atlanta meeting of the Washington-based
Council on Crime in America. The comments, which have irked city officials who
are preparing to host the Olympic Games, were reported today in USA Today.

Declaring that "crime is out of control," Bowers said that from 1960 to 1994,
murders in the city have skyrocketed 185 percent, rapes 859 percent and
robberies 1,634 percent.

Bowers said he used the statistics to illustrate "that something is
fundamentally wrong with a society that this happens to.

"Something is out of whack," Bowers said today. "What I said was, 'I'll bet it's
safer to walk the streets of Sarajevo than it is to walk the streets of my
hometown' and I stand by it even if it irks people. . . . If it makes people
mad, why don't they just shut up and get busy fixing it?"

The comments were condemned by Mayor Bill Campbell who defended the Olympic city
and noted that the crime rate downtown is at its lowest since 1986. "I doubt Mr.
Bowers has ever been to Sarajevo . . . and I assume he is not spending much time
in downtown Atlanta."

Bowers said, "This is happening all over the country, not just Atlanta. But I
have to live and work in Atlanta. The starting point is to define the problem
and that's what I was trying to do. I sure wasn't going to use Honolulu" as an
example.

Effectiveness of '3-strikes' plans questioned

BYLINE: Leslie Phillips

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 4A

LENGTH: 682 words


The latest rage in crime fighting - mandatory life imprisonment after three
violent felonies - is heralded as a sure-fire way to sweep the streets of
hard-core criminals.

The president endorses it.

The public favors it.

And Congress is clamoring to pass a federal law.

The Senate included three separate "three-time loser" proposals in its highly
touted crime bill late last year.

But a close reading of those proposals - and a review of similar habitual
offender laws in 34 states - has critics questioning how effective such new
punishment would be.

-- The wording of all three Senate plans is so broad it would cover burglars,
petty drug dealers, and barroom brawlers - as well as the most violent murderers
and rapists the proposals are aimed at.

-- States with two- or three-strikes-and-you're-out laws have crime rates on a
par with those without such laws.

-- Prison overcrowding is inevitable, and prisons will face the higher costs of
caring for geriatric inmates - estimated at three times the $ 20,000 annual cost
of a regular inmate - even though only 1% of serious crimes are committed by
people over 60.
"We're in the middle of a moral panic," says Barry Krisberg, president of the
National Council on Crime and Delinquency. "I'm not saying violent crime isn't a
serious problem. But these treatments are worse than the disease."
On the other side is a growing, bipartisan array of politicians and experts who
say:

-- Repeat violent offenders will be taken off the streets.

-- Three-strikes laws at the state level are undermined by plea bargains and
early parole.

-- The federal government has always shown its willingness to spend money to
build more prisons.

"There's no question it's a good approach," says former New York City mayor Ed
Koch. "What good are the other things in life if you can't walk the streets, if
you can't go to school, if you can't use the parks without fear of assault?"

The U.S. Sentencing Commission estimates 284 to 689 felons would be affected
annually, based on an analysis of two of the Senate's proposals.

Together, they call for life imprisonment without parole for anyone convicted of
a federal felony after two previous felony convictions for violent or
drug-related crimes.

"Big deal," scoffs Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., author of the third Senate
plan.

His solution? Mandatory life in prison after three violent or drug-related gun
crimes, while also federalizing some state crimes if the states agree.

At a time when the cost of construction a new prison cell is $ 70,000, and
Congress has little discretionary money to spend on new prisons, some say
D'Amato's proposal could be too expensive.

Besides, "there's no way the prison system can handle" the extra traffic, says
Krisberg.

"If all it took was tough laws, we wouldn't have this crime problem," says Marc
Mauer of the Sentencing Project, a prison reform group.

All three Senate proposals cast wide nets. They could, for example, include
offenders who commit property crimes where no one is harmed, or someone
convicted three times for selling drugs near a school.

Tough anti-crime legislation was the public's top priority in a recent USA
TODAY/CNN/Gallup Poll, but "three strikes" proposals and other key elements of
the Senate crime bill are expected to face heavy opposition in the House.

Hearings on the issue have not yet been scheduled.

"Three strikes deals with the chronic person who's out there," says Paul
McNulty, a former Justice Department official under President Bush.

"It doesn't deal with all the other offenders committing their first offense.
Three strikes should not be the centerpiece of an effort to get tough on crime."

Prisons and the crime rate

State and federal prison populations have doubled since 1982, while the crime
rate has risen 32.6%.

Prison population (State, federal) '82 413,806 '83 880,656

Crime rate (per 100,000 people) '82 571.1 '83 757.5

The Nation;
New York City's Gift to Clinton: A Lower National Crime Rate

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

SECTION: Section 4;  Page 5;  Column 1;  Week in Review Desk

LENGTH: 1170 words


NEW YORK CITY'S Republican Mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, may or may not endorse
President Clinton, but he probably has already done as much to re-elect him as
any Democratic mayor.

Mr. Giuliani has not only pursued police policies that have lowered his city's
crime rate so dramatically that it has driven down those of the country --
handing Mr. Clinton a major campaign bragging point in the process -- he has
also thoroughly retooled the neighborhood anti-crime program that the President
is promoting on the stump.

Whatever the paradox, the Clinton campaign unfurled the crime issue as one of
its major themes last week with the kind of symbolism Democrats used to reserve
for civil rights and the war on poverty.

President Clinton surrounded himself with police chiefs, sheriffs and cadets at
the police academy in Columbus, Ohio, during his whistle-stop trip to the
Chicago convention. At the conclave itself, Jim and Sarah Brady, as well as a
Congressional candidate, Carolyn McCarthy, whose husband was killed and son
wounded by a gunman on the Long Island Railroad, made appearances to dramatize
the gun control issue.

"The crime rate has come down for four years in a row," became a stock line in
Mr. Clinton's speeches, while campaign press office handouts reminded reporters
of a line in Mr. Clinton's State of the Union address last January: "Violent
crime is coming down all across America."

In fact, although crime is declining in many cities, it is increasing in others
while remaining level in most suburban and rural areas. The F.B.I.'s nationwide
index of reported violent and property crimes declined 3 percent between 1993
and 1995. But when New York City's 25.9 percent decline over the same period is
excluded, the nation's crime index decline was just 2 percent. Put another way,
New York City -- while constituting less 3 percent of the country's population
-- was responsible for 155,558 of the 432,952 fewer reported crimes over the
three years.

Lock Your Doors, Nashville

Just because the tourist from Nashville can feel safer walking through Central
Park, doesn't mean he should stop locking his front door at night when he
returns home. Of the nation's 25 largest cities, nine actually experienced
higher crime rates in 1995 than 1993: Baltimore, Charlotte, Columbus, Las Vegas,
Memphis, Milwaukee, Nashville, Philadelphia and Phoenix.

Preliminary police reports for the first six months of 1996 show a 25 percent
spike in the murder rate in Washington compared with the same period in 1995,
and lesser rises in 11 other major cities. Meanwhile, the El Paso, Boston, New
Orleans and Detroit police departments all have reported recent increases in
robberies. Again, New York City will help the total national picture with a 12
percent decline in total reported crime for the first six months.

Only three weeks ago, a report issued by Attorney General Janet Reno that said
youth crime was finally coming down after several years of increases produced
politically helpful headlines for the President. She based her claim on a 15
percent decrease in the number of teen-agers arrested for murder from 1994 to
1995 -- but she did not break out the numbers by region. It just so happens that
the same rate in New York City for the same period decreased by 28 percent.

Mr. Giuliani readily recites such statistics, and does so with a long,
pronounced chuckle. "I've spoken to President Clinton and Attorney General Reno
about it," he said, "and privately they acknowledge" that the city is largely
responsible for the drop in crime.

Maybe so, but in public Mr. Clinton does not single out New York. He attributes
the national crime drop to community policing, the Brady gun-control bill and a
1994 crime law designed to help communities hire 100,000 extra police officers.
Never mind that the law hasn't increased the size of the New York City force,
although it did help the N.Y.P.D. avert personnel cuts.

"I'm telling you folks," Mr. Clinton said in a speech last week in Arlington,
Ohio, "we can prevent crime and catch criminals if we have more people serving
their communities out there, visible, who know the kids on the streets, who know
the neighbors, who know the law-abiding folks."

That was exactly the anti-crime vision of former Mayor David N. Dinkins when he
launched his Safe Streets, Safe City plan in 1991. Under that program, 7,000
extra officers were hired as the philosophy of the department was remolded
toward deploying beat cops on every subway train and street corner, patrolling
in uniform. Officers were evaluated by the number of community meetings they
organized, and how conscientious they were in maintaining "beat books" logging
neighborhood problems.

The crime rate dribbled down by 2 or 3 percent a year between 1991 and 1993 --
enough to credit community policing with a victory. But Mr. Giuliani ran
promising to cut crime further and, once victorious, he appointed William J.
Bratton as police commissioner to rework the Dinkins approach.

"Bratton came in and altered the concept that the uniformed cop can do
everything by working with the people," said Thomas A. Reppetto, president of
the Citizens Crime Commission of New York City. "He installed a management
system that pinpointed the crime targets, and he made extensive use of
specialized units, which appears to be counter to the theory of community
policing."

Refining a Concept

Mr. Giuliani and police officials have never publicly disavowed community
policing, saying they have merely refined the concept. But neighborhood leaders
began to complain that they didn't see as many uniformed cops on the beat
anymore only weeks after Mr. Giuliani took office.

No wonder. The department under Mr. Bratton, and now under the new Commissioner,
Howard Safir, has put increasing numbers of officers in plainclothes units to
investigate drug trafficking organizations. Meanwhile, officers were transferred
out of low-crime areas, and redeployed in high-crime neighborhoods. The beat
books were replaced by computerized maps that plot criminal activity as the
primary measurement of a precinct's progress.

Among the Giuliani strategies is the stepped-up ticketing of people caught
drinking and urinating in public, scrawling graffiti, jumping subway turnstiles
and riding bicycles on sidewalks. Such efforts may well improve the quality of
life in neighborhoods -- a primary goal of community policing -- but more than
anything they stretch civil liberties to the limit as officers pat people down
for guns and check them for outstanding warrants.

The tactic has worked to encourage people to keep their guns at home, thereby
decreasing the number of street shootings. Such a strategy, however, has
outraged civil libertarians who champion a more touchy-feely style of community
policing. But even if they don't like Mayor Giuliani's more military style of
community policing, traditional liberal groups will not complain if President
Clinton wins votes as a result.

Major Crime Is Up In New York Overall

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: ALBANY, Aug. 28


The spread of the drug trade helped fuel an increase in the number of violent
crimes reported beyond New York City, the head of the state's Division of
Criminal Justice Services said today.

But a decrease within the city was big enough to offset the rise elsewhere and
the reported number of crimes declined statewide. The agency said the number of
index crimes -- which include murder, rape, aggravated assault and robberies --
decreased by 1 percent last year in New York State compared with 1990. The
reason was mainly a 4 percent decline in crimes reported in New York City. There
were 680,521 reported crimes in the city, the report said.

But the number of reported crimes rose 5 percent in upstate New York to 290,038,
and increased 4 percent on Long Island and in Westchester and Rockland Counties,
to 155,944, according to the report.

Commissioner Richard H. Girgenti said the troubling rise in suburban and even
rural areas could be tied to the drug problem.

New York Leads Big Cities in Robbery Rate, but Drops in Murders

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

New York City led the nation's 25 largest cities in robberies last year,
claiming the dubious distinction for the second straight year at a time when
reports of violent crime were surging across America, an analysis of data
released today by Federal officials indicates.

In a city where crime has become a dominant theme of private and political
discourse, a record 100,280 robberies were reported to the police last year --
13.7 for every 1,000 residents, according to the Federal Bureau of
Investigation's annual Uniform Crime Reports for 1990.

But despite a record 2,262 homicides last year, New York City dropped from ninth
to 10th in murders per capita, and its homicide rate was only slightly higher
than the average for the country's 25 largest cities, an analysis of the Federal
data by The New York Times showed.

New York City had 30.9 murders for every 100,000 residents, just above the
big-city average of 29.2, and would have ranked 11th, behind Chicago, but for
the 87 deaths in the Happy Land social club fire, The Times analysis showed.

Five-Year Trends

Using 1990 census data and Federal and local crime statistics, the analysis
calculated and ranked the per capita robbery and murder rates for the nation's
25 largest cities over the last five years, and ranked robbery and murder rates
for New York's five boroughs for 1990.

Tracking the five-year trends, New York's robbery rate turned down in 1986, but
has been rising steadily since and passed previously top-ranked Detroit in 1988,
the analysis showed. New York's murder rate has shown a steady though gradual
rise since 1986, but has been lower than those for Washington, New Orleans,
Detroit, Dallas and Baltimore.

Within New York City, The Times analysis showed, the Bronx had the highest
murder rate, with 54.2 homicides for every 100,000 residents, followed by
Manhattan with 33.8, Brooklyn with 33.3, Queens with 16 and Staten Island with
7.7.

But Manhattan was found to lead New York's boroughs in its rate of reported
robberies last year, with 18.1 for every 1,000 residents, followed by 15.8 for
Brooklyn, 14.8 for the Bronx, 9.3 for Queens and 2.7 for Staten Island.

In the nation, Washington, continuing a five-year climb, recorded the highest
murder rate among major cities in 1990, with 77.8 killings for every 100,000
residents. The nation's capital was followed by New Orleans, Detroit, Dallas,
Baltimore, Houston, Cleveland, Memphis, Philadelphia and New York.

Worst Robbery Rates

The major cities with the highest robbery rates after New York were Chicago,
Baltimore, Detroit, New Orleans, Washington, Dallas, Boston, Los Angeles and,
tied for 10th, Cleveland and San Francisco. All but the last two exceeded the
average rate for the 25 largest cities -- 9.7 robberies for every 1,000
residents.

The F.B.I.'s Uniform Crime Reports for 1990, a 365-page compendium titled "Crime
in the United States," was issued by the bureau's Director, William S. Sessions.
Its voluminous data are based on crimes reported to 16,000 law-enforcement
agencies and the report is regarded as the nation's most comprehensive survey of
criminal activity and trends.

Across the nation, the report said, overall violent crime increased 11 percent
last year over 1989, with homicides and forcible rape each up 9 percent and
robbery and aggravated assault each up 11 percent. In other categories,
burglaries decreased 3 percent, auto theft rose 5 percent, larceny was up 1
percent and arson rose 3 percent.

The report said that firearms were used in 3 of every 5 murders in the United
States, that 78 percent of the victims were men and that only 14 percent of the
victims were murdered by strangers.

Most Women Killed by Men

It also said that, in situations with a single victim and a single offender, 93
percent of the black murder victims were killed by blacks and that 86 percent of
the white victims were slain by whites. While 85 percent of the men were killed
by other men, it said, 9 out of every 10 women were slain by men.

Experts have cited many factors, including surges in drug use and drug disputes,
for the rising homicide rates. Thomas A. Reppetto, a criminologist who heads the
Citizens Crime Commission of New York, a private organization that analyzes
criminal justice issues, said one explanation for New York City's high robbery
rate lay in the way people get around.

"This is less of an auto town than other places," he said in an interview.
"People take subways and other public transportation. They walk a lot. They are
much more vulnerable to robbery than people who ride around enclosed in iron
boxes."

The F.B.I. report said some of the complex factors that accounted for crime
rates included the density, composition and stability of populations; modes of
transportation; economic and cultural conditions; climate; the effective
strength of law-enforcement agencies; attitudes of citizens, and the policies of
government.

SMITH ORDERS STUDY ON VIOLENT CRIMES

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to the New York Times

SECTION: Section A; Page 16, Column 1; National Desk

LENGTH: 591 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 5


Asserting that violent crime had increased 59 percent in the last decade,
Attorney General William French Smith appointed an advisory committee today to
tell him what the Federal Government should do about it.

Mr. Smith said former Attorney General Griffin B. Bell and Gov.  James R.
Thompson of Illinois would be co-chairmen of the group, the Attorney General's
Task Force on Violent Crime. It will offer a prelimary report in 60 days and
final recommendations this summer.

Members of the panel, besides Mr. Bell, a Democrat, and Governor Thompson, a
Republican, are James Q. Wilson, professor of government at Harvard; David L.
Armstrong, Commonwealth's Attorney for Jefferson County, Ky.; Frank G.
Carrington, a Virginia Beach lawyer who champions the rights of crime victims;
Robert L. Edwards of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement; Police Chief
William L. Hart of Detroit, and Wilbur Littlefield, the public defender for Los
Angeles County.

Crime was studied by several Presidential commissions in the 1960's. Some
Justice Department surveys suggest crime may not have increased as dramatically
as Mr. Smith says it has. He insisted that the Federal Government would be
''neglecting an obvious public sentiment'' if it did not place more emphasis on
the problem.

''Last year 30 percent of all households in the United States were touched by
some serious crime,'' Mr. Smith said today at his first news conference. ''Since
1970, the incidence of violent crime in this country has increased 59 percent
while the population has increased less than 10 percent. In the single year from
1978 to 1979, violent crime increased 11 percent, and the preliminary data for
1980 indicate that violent crime increased an additional 10 percent.''

Gun Control Opposed

He said, however, that he opposed gun control, often suggested to combat violent
crime. The Reagan Administration, he said, ''feels very strongly that this
problem can be better dealt with by more stringent enforcement and more strict
sentencing.''

Reversing his recent predecessors, Mr. Smith said Congress could legislate
exceptions to the appellate review powers of Federal courts to remove particular
issues from the jurisdiction of Federal judges.  There have been proposals to
divest the Supreme Court of its review power on school prayer, school busing and
abortion. Without commenting on the merits of any specific proposal, Mr. Smith
said, ''That's a prerogative of Congress.''

Mr. Smith would not confirm reports that a Federal grand jury was investigating
Frank Sinatra and some of his close associates in a case involving the alleged
skimming of money from a theater in Tarrytown, N.Y. Mr. Smith said that he would
not make public his official telephone logs as his most recent predecessors, Mr.
Bell and Benjamin R. Civiletti, had. Such openness, he said, was an
''overreaction'' to Watergate.

His conclusions about violent crime were based mainly on the Uniform Crime
Reports of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The validity of those statistics
has been debated over the years. In 1973 the Justice Department developed an
alternative method of measuring crime, based on household interviews.

Reporting on its latest household survey, the department's Bureau of Justice
Statistics announced last September, ''Serious crime rates remained essentially
unchanged between 1973 and 1979.''

Birmingham Community Safety Partnership's website was given a makeover after it
won an international map competition.

Earlier this year the partnership, which is responsible for delivering crime
reduction initiatives across the city, won best map in the 8th Annual
International Crime Mapping Conference held in Savannah, Georgia, USA.

The map shows priority neighbourhoods across the city based on crime figures.

Coun Jim Whorwood (Lib Dem South Yardley), cabinet member for local services and
community safety, said: "Community safety is a key priority for the council and
is a key concern for Birmingham citizens.

"It is essential that we use the latest means of communication and this website
is an example of how BCSP is determined to provide an excellent and relevant
service.

"This improved website will enable agencies and the wider community to see what
the city and its partners are doing to make Birmingham a safer place for us all
to live."

The organisation is a partnership of Birmingham City Council, West Midlands
Police, Birmingham Health Services, Birmingham Voluntary Services Council, West
Midlands Fire Service, and National Probation Service - West Midlands.

BCSP has six priorities which include creating a safer and cleaner city,
providing effective drug treatment and reducing gang violence

Casinos would bring more crime to Massachusetts

BYLINE: The Lowell Sun

By Kristen Bugden

Massachusetts is in current debate of whether to allow casinos to operate. Gov.
Deval Patrick has filed a casino gambling bill proposing the creation of the
Massachusetts Gaming Control Authority which would control the licenses and
regulations of casinos. Several pros and cons have been suggested involving the
legalization of gambling in Massachusetts. The issues of debate have shown that
circumstances surrounding the "con" side of the argument certainly outweigh the
"pro" side.

Of significant concern is the likely increase of criminal activity resulting
from the casino atmosphere and gambling. Previous casino introductions into
communities, similar to Boston, have been coupled with increases in major
violent crimes including: murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault, as well
as major property offenses such as burglary and larceny. A professor at the
University of Nevada examined the impact of casino openings on crime rates in
Wisconsin from 1992 to 1994. Data from this study showed there was an average of
5,277 more major crimes a year due to casinos. The cost associated with this
increase in criminal activity (i.e. victim's losses and costs of police,
prosecution, and imprisonment) amounted to nearly $51 million a year.
Furthermore, the total number of crimes within a 30-mile radius of Atlantic City
increased by 107 percent in nine years following the introduction of casinos to
Atlantic City.

The increase in crime has been attributed to increases in gambling which may
ultimately result in gambling addiction. Statistics from Gamblers Anonymous
suggests that 4 to 6 percent of gamblers eventually become compulsive gamblers.

Consequently, compulsive gamblers are more likely to commit illegal acts out of
desperation for money or from the stress caused by gambling losses.
Approximately 97 percent of incarcerated compulsive gamblers admit to engaging
in illegal behavior to finance gambling or to pay gambling-related debts.

Deval Patrick's main argument for bringing casinos into Massachusetts is the
potential $100 million profit a year in tax revenue for the state. Does the
potential for profit in the state of Massachusetts really outweigh the obvious
negative societal effects that would result from casinos and legalization of
gambling? How much of this would need to be invested into policing and other
crime prevention, considering the cost associated with crime? Once gambling is
legalized, there is no limit to the number of casinos that can be built in the
state of Massachusetts. More casinos equal more crime in the surrounding areas
of the casinos, as we've seen with Atlantic City. By supporting Gov. Deval
Patrick's bill and the legalization of gambling, we may just be promoting the
growth of Boston into the next Las Vegas.

Consider these statistics:

Nevada has 742 violent crimes per 100,000 inhabitants. Massachusetts has 447
violent crimes per 100,000 inhabitants.

Is this really what the citizens of Massachusetts have to look forward to?

U.S. HOMICIDE RATE AT 40-YEAR LOW

BYLINE: Staff and Wire Services

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. N8

LENGTH: 598 words


WASHINGTON - The first decline in four years in the U.S. homicide rate is very
good news for some cities but does not mark a return to the large national crime
declines of the 1990s, experts say.

Troubling signs in some cities - increased gang violence, for example - were not
enough to push national crime figures up in the annual FBI compilation of crimes
reported to the police.

Instead, the FBI reported Monday that the homicide rate in 2004 dropped to its
lowest level in 40 years.

Los Angeles saw a small jump in homicides in 2004 - 518, up from 515 in 2003.
But rapes were down 7.7 percent, robberies were down 15.1 percent and aggravated
assaults were down 12.9 percent.

In the San Fernando Valley, homicides fell 6 percent and violent crime fell 15.4
percent.

The rates for all seven major crimes were down and the overall violent crime
rate reached a 30-year low, according to the FBI's compilation.

There were 391 fewer homicides nationwide in 2004 than the year before, the FBI
said. Last year's total of 16,137 works out to 5.5 homicides for every 100,000
people.

That's a decline of 3.3 percent from 2003 and the lowest homicide rate since
1965, when it was 5.1.

``The declines are relatively small compared to larger, steady drops in the
1990s, and the results are by no means the same across the country,'' said
professor Alfred Blumstein of Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh.

``We're not seeing important national trends like the shrinking of crack markets
in the 1990s,'' Blumstein added. ``These are responses to local situations,
changes in local drug markets and shifts in gangs.''

``The best news is that there's no national increase despite reasons - like
economic conditions - why it could rise,'' said professor James Alan Fox of
Northeastern University in Boston. Other reasons he cited were growing gang
violence in some cities, local law enforcement budget cuts and a shift of
federal law enforcement aid from local police hiring to homeland security.

``It would be easy to look at these numbers and get too complacent about crime,
'' Fox said. ``That would be a mistake.''

The four major violent crimes - homicide, rape, robbery and aggravated assaults
- declined from 1.38 million in 2003 to 1.37 million in 2004. That produced a
2.2 percent drop in the violent crime rate, to 465.5 crimes per 100,000 people -
the lowest since 1974, when it was 461.1 violent crimes per 100,000.

The three major property crimes - burglary, auto theft and larceny-theft -
declined from 10.42 million to 10.33 million in 2004. That pulled the property
crime rate down 2.1 percent, to 3,517.1 crimes per 100,000 people. These crimes
produced an estimated loss of $16.1 billion, down 5 percent from 2003.

Rape was the only one of the seven crimes to show a numerical increase, up 0.8
percent, to 94,635 offenses, but the rate of rape declined 0.2 percent, to 32.2
rapes per 100,000. Lynn Parish of the Rape, Abuse & Incest Network, a national
anti-sexual assault group, said Justice Department studies show that the
incidence of rape, whether reported to police or not, has been declining over 30
years while reporting of rape to police has climbed for a decade.

The FBI data was compiled from reports to more than 17,000 law enforcement
agencies, representing 94.2 percent of the nation's population. The Justice
Department has found that barely half of all violent crimes and fewer than 40
percent of property crimes are reported to the police, but its surveys of crime
victims, which also track unreported crimes, show trends similar to those among
the reported crimes tracked by the FBI.

Editorials: Demand gun crackdown;
 Week of two shooting sprees is good time to push for restrictions.

FBI statistics tell us that gun crime is down across America. Try telling that
to Xerox employees in Honolulu or to frightened residents of Seattle or to the
grieving survivors of young churchgoers in Fort Worth, day- traders in Buckhead
or high-schoolers in Littleton, Colo.

The circumstances in these recent horrors vary, but they share this in common:
Innocent people went to their places of work, of worship or of learning never
imagining they would be the object of someone's rage or dementia. In each case a
killer or killers were able to claim a multiple number of victims because they
were armed, not with a sharp or blunt instrument of limited lethal range, but
with a weapon with which they could project their hostility --- a firearm.

Which of us can feel totally secure when violence can erupt so unpredictably, so
randomly and, alas, so efficiently?

Yet there is some comfort to be found in the FBI crime data. For the seventh
year in a row, crime numbers were down in 1998, including a 7 percent drop in
homicides and a 10 percent reduction in robberies, both largely attributable to
a reduced use of guns. It's hard to say if the falloff is a result of tougher
prosecution of gun crimes or tighter control on gun access due, for instance, to
mandated buyer background checks. It could be both. Whatever the case, it does
show that efforts over this decade to crack down on gun crime can have a
positive effect.

That's all the more reason to wonder why the current Congress seems paralyzed on
the subject of gun control. It can't even tighten so obvious a source of
unregulated and unlimited weapons sales as gun shows. True, the Senate did pass
a bill in May to put some controls on this commerce, but the House defeated it
in June. A conference committee charged with the duty of working out a
compromise on the gun show issue hasn't even met since August. That's
disgraceful.

Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), who lives in the Seattle neighborhood where
Wednesday's shooting took place, put her finger on the major obstacle to
sensible government policy on firearms.

"The National Rifle Association has a lock-hold on legislation (in Congress) ,
and the only thing that's going to break that is a public outcry," she said.

Granted, Americans realize that this country has more guns than it knows what to
do with and that no set of laws can bulletproof them. Just the same, it is
possible to make firearms more difficult to obtain by persons with a history of
violence or mental/emotional instability. Failing that, it is possible to
minimize the damage they might do.

This week of the Honolulu and Seattle shootings is a fitting time to flood the
Capitol Hill switchboard and e-mailboxes with expressions of zero tolerance for
America's seemingly unending string of gun outrages.

Demand tighter controls on arms and ammo sales at gun shows. Insist on a ban on
the importation of large ammunition clips. Press for child safety locks on all
new guns sold.

Ask the members of Congress if they've forgotten so soon their own workplace was
attacked last year by a madman with a gun who killed two guards in the process.
What does it take to spur them to act?

Hate crime statistics promise much, reveal little

BYLINE: Al Knight, Denver Post Perspective Editor

SECTION: PERSPECTIVE; Pg. E-05

LENGTH: 1203 words


Hate crime statistics are often advanced as a reliable indicator that our
society is becoming less tolerant, less civil and much more dangerous.

But far from being one of the most reliable indexes, hate crime statistics may
be among the most unreliable.

As will be shown, there continue to be serious problems with the absence of an
accurate statistical history to which current figures may be compared. There
also are problems concerning what is reported and to whom. And finally, there is
a political spin which is attached to nearly every set of figures that further
erodes their credibility.

In what has become an annual ritual, gay and lesbian groups across the nation
coordinate news conferences early in March to announce the number of hate crimes
their members have reported in the previous year.

Such a series of news conferences was held again this year on March 8 with the
predictable results that some cities, including Denver and Los Angeles,
experienced increases in such crimes while others including Boston, Chicago, New
York and San Francisco experienced decreases.

In the peculiar politics of gay rights, however, there can be no good news.
Where the news was bad it is very bad. Where the news was good, it is also bad.

Where the crimes went down last year the gay and lesbian groups were quick to
point out that the decline didn't necessarily mean an increase in tolerance, but
rather a shift in the types of offenses being committed.

Here is a sample from the San Francisco Chronicle:

"Incidents of violence against gays and lesbians declined last year in San
Francisco, but the assaults - with guns, knives and baseball bats embedded with
razor blades - were more vicious, according to a report released yesterday by
gay rights advocates."

The only subsequent reference to the baseball bats was an incident in which a
gay man was allegedly attacked with such a weapon and, according to the
Chronicle, "suffered several cuts on his scalp that required stitches."

The Minneapolis Star Tribune used a similar approach, reporting "violent hate
crimes against gays and lesbians in Minnesota are down from a year ago, but
verbal harassment is rising."

In Denver, the official press release, under the headline, "Anti-gay hate
violence rises in Colorado," reported a 13 percent increase in such crimes over
1992.

Such an increase, of course, might be reason for concern, but for those
aforementioned problems of definition and the issue of what is reported and to
whom.

The Colorado Ethnic Intimidation Law doesn't include gays and lesbians. The
state's law covers ethnic, racial and religious groups, and so far in the few
years it has been in effect no one has been convicted under its terms. It
specifies that it is a hate crime to by "words or conduct, knowingly place
another person in fear of imminent lawless action directed at that person or
that person's property." The statute specifies that the words or conduct must be
"likely to produce bodily injury to that person or damage to that person's
property."

Since there have been no successful prosecutions, technically, the state has yet
to experience its first "hate crime."

What we have instead are allegations of hate crimes kept by two sources.

Source number one is the gay and lesbian groups themselves, which have hot lines
where members are urged to report all incidents. Last year the Denver group
tabulated 229 reports compared to 204 reported the year before.

The second source is the police department of Denver, which is keeping
statistics under a 1990 federal law that requires hate crimes be tabulated. The
federal reporting law specifically includes sexual orientation as one of the
covered categories to be reported. The federal government itself does not have a
hate crime statute, although Congress has been urged to pass one.

The Denver Police Department reported 24 incidents in 1993, up from 21 the year
before, a 14 percent increase.

A review of those 24 offense reports shows that there are several problems with
using these crime statistics as proof of anything.

First of all, several of them appear to have grown out of some rather sleazy
sexual encounters in or outside of various gay bars. One of them involving
sexual assault and theft was reported in January 1993:

"Victim reported that he met listed suspects at --------- Bar. Victim gave
suspects his address, inviting them to his residence. At approximately 0300
suspects arrived at victim's residence. Victim and suspects spent a couple of
hours talking. Victim and suspect # 2 left residence going to 1580 Colorado for
cigarettes and returned approximately 20 minutes later. Upon returning suspect
#1 was on the phone stating that someone had stolen his vehicle. He continued to
talk on phone for approximately 30 minutes as suspect # 2 and victim engaged in
a sexual act in victim's bedroom."

Let's translate that from the police vernacular. The victim met two guys he
didn't know, invited them to his house at 3 o'clock in the morning, had sex with
one of them, and then was beaten and robbed.

If that is a hate crime as defined by the legislature, heaven help us.

In a February incident the victim was at another gay bar when at closing time he
was approached by two strange men. He invited both to his apartment and was
later robbed.

In yet another incident a victim reported answering the door. The stranger asked
to use the apartment phone, did so and then raped him. The incident was reported
some time later after the alleged rapist appeared a second time and was chased
from the scene by the "victim's roommate." Whether this story was concocted to
cover up an earlier liaison cannot be known with certainty.

What is known is that these three incidents don't sound at all like the kind of
incident likely to stir up support for hate crime legislation.

Nor do some of the intimidation reports included in the Denver police file. In
one case a woman had an anti-Amendment 2 sticker on the car which provoked a
group of young men to yell insults at her.

Still others involve telephoned threats and insults.

One notable report concerned a landlord trying to evict a homosexual man. He
posted notices on the door, one saying, "We do not allow gays to live in this
building." The gay tenant said he felt threatened and intimidated.

One of the points made at the March 8 press conference was that the State of
Colorado should amend its hate crime statute to specifically include crimes
against gays and lesbians.

The legislature has in the past rejected such requests.

A better case can be made that the law should be eliminated altogether. It
attempts to determine motives for crimes based upon fragments of what is said
during the commission of the offense.

The crimes listed above are in many cases real crimes but it is very hard to
think of them as a particularly good index on whether society as a whole is
becoming more or less tolerant.

Denver could have experienced a decrease in hate crimes in 1993 if a few people
would have had the good sense to be careful about whom they took home when the
gay bars closed for the night.

High percentages of assaults, robberies are committed under influence of crack
// 'If we knew the exact numbers, we'd be shocked'

BYLINE: STEVAN ALLEN

SECTION: NATIONAL; CRACK: EVERYONE PAYS; Pg. 13A

LENGTH: 695 words



As crack's influence spreads, police, attorneys, judges and politicians    are
asking the same question: How many people are using it?

     Maj. Bert Hatcher, narcotics enforcement commander of the Tampa    Police
Department, decided to ask the users. In an informal four-month    survey, he
and other officers recently interviewed scores of robbery    suspects.

     "We found out 80 to 85 percent of them were either high on the    drug at
the time of the crime or were committing the crime to get it,"    Hatcher said.
"If we knew the exact numbers, we'd all be shocked.

     Though far from conclusive, the numbers nonetheless underscore the
unprecedented lawlessness that crack has brought to the Tampa Bay area,    a
frightening increase in assaults, robberies and other crimes    committed by
crack addicts desperate for another "rock."

     Five years after crack hit the streets of Tampa Bay in 1984,    property
crimes such as burglary and auto theft increased 40 percent or    more. Assaults
increased at least 20 percent during the same period,    according to the
Florida Department of Law Enforcement.

    Though population growth and other factors may have some bearing on    such
figures, law enforcement authorities fear the worst.

     "The impact of this drug is so significant you can't even compare    it,"
said Hatcher.

     Pinellas sheriff's Maj. Jim Coats estimates that 60 percent of the
property crimes committed in areas patrolled by the department are
drug-related, and the drug most often is crack.

     Hillsborough officials tell a similar story.

     "We believe between 60 and 80 percent of all the people we arrest    for
property crimes have a crack problem," said Lt. Jim Kelley of the    sheriff's
office.

     Authorities say it's difficult to assess crack's influence for at    least
two reasons: Not all crack-related crimes are reported, and    different police
agencies use different reporting techniques.

     But available national figures are equally unsettling.

     The National Institute of Justice conducted urinalysis tests on men    who
were arrested for a variety of non-drug felonies in major U.S.    cities. The
tests, conducted from April to June of 1988, were designed    to find out what
role drugs play in crime. The results:        In New York City, 83 percent of
the men arrested had cocaine in    their system. In Los Angeles it was 65
percent; Chicago, 57 percent;

 Washington, D.C., 55 percent; Houston, 54 percent; Dallas, 53 percent;

 New Orleans, 52 percent.

     While the tests did not distinguish between crack and powder    cocaine,
researchers believe that most who tested positive for cocaine    were on crack.

Angels 'prey on fear of violence'; Guardian Angels

BYLINE: DAVID LEPPARD and JOHN LIPPMAN

SECTION: Issue 8581.

LENGTH: 507 words


PAUL CHANNON, the transport secretary, will this week study American evidence
which shows the Guardian Angels do not deter crime and instead prey on people's
fears by exaggerating violence.

Studies in the United States confirm the views of government ministers that last
week's arrival of the New York vigilantes will have no effect on the crime wave
on the Tube.


'The answer to the problem of crime on the Underground is to have more police,
and that is exactly what we have announced, ' one senior minister said.
'Frankly, we wish they would just go home.'

Last week Michael Portillo, the minister for public transport, said 80 extra
police officers would be posted to the Underground. The announcement came as the
Angels claimed their first success in foiling a mugging at Brixton, south
London.

A three-volume study published by the American Justice Department in 1985 showed
that in San Diego, California, assaults against the public increased by 2% in
areas patrolled by the Angels while they fell by 9% elsewhere.

Suzanne Pennell, who headed the study, said statistics used by Curtis Sliwa, the
Angels' leader, to defend his vigilantes, were misleading.

In San Diego, Sliwa claims the Angels helped reduce violent crime by 22% in
streets patrolled by his members. But Pennell points to a 42% decrease in areas
which they left alone. 'It's difficult to associate a drop in crime to the
Angels' activities, ' she said.

Dennis Kenney, an expert in vigilante groups at the Police Foundation, a
Washington think tank, found the Angels were prone to exaggerate crime on New
York's subway.

'We were not able to show they had an effect on crime at all, ' he said. Kenney
says the media attention given to the Angels has created the impression crime is
a worse problem than statistics bear out.

'In order to exist the Angels have to persuade the public that they are needed.
Their survival depends on the perception of a crime problem. Sliwa is there to
convince you all how bad it is in London now.'

Critics say the Angels should concentrate on policing their own crime-infested
cities, instead of coming to London where the crime problem is much lower.

Last year there were 12 murders and 34 rapes on the New York subway while,
according to 1987 figures, the latest available, there was one murder and four
rapes on the London Underground.

Although the Angels have carried out citizens' arests on more than 1,000 street
criminals in America in the last decade, more than 200 of their members have
been arrested.

American experts agree that although the Angels do not have an impact on crime,
their presence can reduce the fear of attack.

Ministers concede there is nothing that can be done about the presence of the
Angels in London as long as they commit no offences. But they have made it clear
that the situation will be watched closely.

'We are well aware that the whole Guardian Angels thing is a publicity stunt
that will do nothing to help the situation, ' said one minister.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 6


Laws requiring long sentences for three-time violent offenders have had no
apparent success in reducing crime, a group that studies the justice system said
today.

From 1994 to 1995, both violent and overall crime rates dropped more in the 37
states without such three-strike laws than in the 13 that had them, said the
group, the Justice Policy Institute.

Violent crime fell 4.6 percent in states without the laws, while it fell 1.7
percent with them, the group said. For overall crime, the decline was 1.2
percent for states without the mandatory sentencing provisions and 0.4 percent
for those with them.

The 13 states that had three-strike laws in 1994 were California, Colorado,
Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Louisiana, Maryland, New Mexico, North Carolina,
Tennessee, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin. Of those, eight saw increases in
violent crimes in 1994-1995.

The persistence of American hate crime; While the number of active hate groups
in the U.S. has fallen, the incidence rate is steady. After Wednesday's mass
shooting in Charleston, S.C., the Washington Post offers context on these crimes
from the Southern Poverty Law Center, the FBI and other sources

SECTION: CONTEXT; Pg. A16

LENGTH: 511 words


BLACKS MOST LIKELY TO BE TARGETED FBI hate crime data show that more than 50 out
of every one million black citizens were victims of a racially motivated hate
crime in 2012, the highest among any racial group. But this is almost certainly
an undercount. The FBI is reliant on state and local law enforcement agencies to
categorize and report hate crimes correctly. Some agencies do a much better job
of this than others, and there is general agreement that the FBI numbers are
significantly lower than they should be.

INCIDENCE RATE STABLE OVER PAST DECADE The Bureau of Justice Statistics provides
the most comprehensive overall count of hate crime incidents. Their data, drawn
from interviews with victims, shows the number of hate crimes has remained
fairly constant over the past 10 years, hovering between 200,000 and 300,000
annually. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, the number of active
hate groups, which it defines as "groups have beliefs or practices that attack
or malign an entire class of people, typically for their immutable
characteristics," more than doubled from 457 in 1999 to 1018 in 2011. Since then
the number of active groups has declined to 784. The SPLC attributes this to
various causes - including an improving economy and recent law enforcement
crackdowns, as well as widespread internecine squabbling and splintering within
the groups themselves.

CONCENTRATED IN DEEP SOUTH, NORTHERN PLAINS Hate groups aren't distributed
evenly by geography. Controlling for the population in each state, hate groups
are concentrated most in the Deep South and in the Montana/Idaho region. Vermont
and New Hampshire also stand out. Partially, this is a function of low
population - Vermont has fewer than 700,000 residents, which combined with its
four active hate groups gives it a high per-capita value. But this may not just
be an artifact of low population. Researchers at Humboldt State University
recently mapped geocoded tweets containing hate speech, and their map does
appear to show a high incidence of hate-tweets originating in Vermont.

BRED BY HARDSHIP A 2002 review of hate crime literature by Princeton economist
Alan Krueger looked at the economic determinants of hate crime - whether crimes
rose and fell in response to conditions like poverty and unemployment. Krueger
concludes that "rather than economic conditions, the hate crimes literature
points to a breakdown in law enforcement and official sanctioning and
encouragement of civil disobedience as significant causes." But economists Matt
Ryan and Peter Leeson in 2010 examined the links between hate groups and hate
crime in the U.S. and found the primary determinants seem to be economic. "Our
results suggest that unemployment and, to a lesser extent, poverty, are strongly
associated with more hate crime, particularly crimes that are sexually, racially
and religiously motivated."

The most recent SPLC data also seems to show a relationship between active hate
groups and economic conditions in a state. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2015 Postmedia Network

St. Louis tops rankings as most dangerous U.S. city

LENGTH: 111  words


St. Louis, Mo., has replaced Camden, N.J., as the most dangerous U.S. city,
according to a study based on FBI crime data and released Monday.

St. Louis had 2,070 violent crimes per 100,000 residents last year, well over
the national average of 429, according to the report issued by social science
publisher CQ Press.

Camden ranked second this year, with Detroit; Flint, Mich.; and Oakland, Calif.,
rounding out the top five.

No reason was given for St. Louis moving to the top of the crime list.

The safest city, statistically speaking, was seen as Colonie, N.Y., a suburb of
Albany.

The report was drawn from FBI crime data that includes murder, rape, robbery and
burglary.

Fear of Crime at Fifteen-Year High

LENGTH: 464  words

DATELINE: Lahore



 Washington: Independent Women's Forum's Association has issued the followiAng
news release:



      The rise in Americans' level of concern about crime could reflect actual,
albeit modest, increases in crime, as well as increasing media coverage of it.
The number of violent crimes reported to police across the country in the first
half of 2015 was up by 1.7% compared with the same period in 2014, according to
the FBI's 2015 Uniform Crime Report. Many large U.S. cities reported spikes in
their homicide rates in 2015, including Milwaukee, St. Louis, Baltimore and
Washington, D.C. From a long-term perspective, though, violent crime is down
significantly since the 1990s.





 As might be expected, the less affluent are more worried about crime:



     Americans across all major subgroups show heightened worry about crime
compared with 2014. Worry has increased the most among those without a college
degree and those living in households earning $30,000 to less than $75,000
annually.



     More broadly, those with no college education are roughly twice as likely
as those with a college degree to worry about crime, and those living in
households earning less than $30,000 per year are much more likely than those
earning at least $75,000 to worry about crime and violence. Nonwhites' concern
about crime is much higher than whites' worry about the issue.



 There is also a racial divide: While 46 percent of whites are deeply concerned
about crime, 68 percent of non-whites share the same level of worry. Concern
about illegal drug use, which goes hand in hand with a rise in criminal
activity, has also skyrocketed.



 I can't help but wonder if some of the fear among non-whites is the result of
demonizing the police and thus making it harder for the police to do their job
in some communities.New York's more stringent stop and frisk rules may make the
police reluctant to confront potential criminals.



 In commenting on the Gallup poll, Powerline seems to be going in the same
direction:



     Although the concerns of all Americans matter, nowadays it seems
fashionable in many quarters to believe that Black Worries Matter more. Thus, I
hope it's not amiss to point out that blacks worry more than whites about crime
and drug use. ...



     The desire of President Obama, liberals generally, and some conservatives
to release convicted drug dealers from jail and be more lenient towards drug
dealers going forward seems particularly misguided under the present
circumstances.



 Of course if you are a college-educated liberal who can afford a safe
neighborhood, these matters might not concern you as much as they do less
affluent segments of the population.

EDITORIAL: Arresting blight is part of crime solution

BYLINE: The Fayetteville Observer, N.C.

SECTION: COMMENTARY

LENGTH: 415 words


Feb. 27--The evidence supporting the "broken windows" theory of crime prevention
is almost overwhelming: Crime spawns fastest in squalor. Clean up the messes and
you begin to clean up crime.

Fixing the broken windows won't, by itself, make the crime rate come crashing
down. But creating a community that's clean and in good repair is an essential
element of a crime-prevention strategy.

As Observer reporter Greg Barnes found in stories published on Sunday, Southern
communities from Atlanta to Memphis to Spartanburg, S.C., have created dramatic
cuts in the crime rate when they redeveloped some of their most troubled,
rundown neighborhoods.

The resurrection of Atlanta's East Lake neighborhood has become a blueprint that
some other cities are using with considerable success. East Lake was the home of
aging housing projects, extensive poverty, ineffective schools and, especially,
rampant crime and violence.

But a developer and philanthropist with vision came to the area and sought to
restore what was once the home golf course of the legendary Bobby Jones. To make
it work, he found he needed to find a way to rebuild the community around the
course as well. Partnering with local and federal government agencies,
developers razed the housing project and built new mixed-income housing. They
started a charter school that has lifted student achievement from Atlanta's
worst to its best. And they brought in institutions, like the YMCA, that offer
health and wellness programs.

The result? A reborn, thriving neighborhood, soaring real-estate values in
adjacent neighborhoods, violent crime down 90 percent and all crime down 70
percent. Some other cities using the East Lake formula are seeing similar
success.

Now return to Fayetteville. We have no shortage of rundown areas with high
crime, much like Atlanta's East Lake of old. And while we have had a positive
experience with a Hope VI development that replaced two crime-ridden public
housing projects, the city hasn't created the whole package -- mixed-income
housing, top-echelon schools, health and wellness programs.

Police Chief Harold Medlock has asked the City Council for 68 more staffers in
his department. He should get them. But that's only part of our crime solution.
Fixing our broken windows, with a big, comprehensive plan, must be part of it
too.

Number of reported hate crimes up slightly in Utah

BYLINE: Pat Reavy Deseret News

LENGTH: 265 words


SALT LAKE CITY ? Race-related issues were the most reported types of hate crimes
in Utah in 2011, according to newly released statistics from the FBI.

The Hate Crimes Statistics report compiles statistics submitted by law
enforcement agencies across the nation regarding hate crimes that involve bias
in race, religion, sexual orientation, ethnicity and disability. The FBI
reported 6,222 hate crime incidents in 2011 nationally involving more than 7,700
victims, with nearly half of those crimes being related to racial bias. In Utah
? with a population of more than 2.7 million ? 68 hate crimes were reported by
police during 2011. California, with a population of more than 37 million, had
the most reported hate crimes in 2011 at 1,040, followed by New York, New Jersey
and Massachusetts. The 2011 statistics mark the third year in a row that the
number of reported hate crimes in Utah increased. There were 63 hate crimes
reported in 2010; 48 in 2009; 40 in 2008; and 55 in 2007. According to the FBI's
statistics, the most common type of hate crime in 2011 in Utah was racial bias
with 29 reported incidents. That was followed by bias over religion and bias
over sexual orientation. The Unified Police Department investigated the greatest
number of hate crimes in Utah in 2011 with 12, according to FBI statistics. It
also had the largest number of reported hate crimes concerning race, religion
and sexual orientation. Bountiful had four reported hate crimes in 2011, with
three of them relating to religious bias, the FBI reported. E-mail:

St. Louis tops list of most dangerous U.S. cities

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. P9A

LENGTH: 256 words


TRENTON, N.J. - St. Louis overtook Camden, N.J., as the nation's most dangerous
city in 2009, according to a national study released Sunday.

The study by CQ Press found St. Louis had 2,070.1 violent crimes per 100,000
residents, compared with a national average of 429.4. That helped St. Louis beat
out Camden, which topped last year's list and was the most dangerous city for
2003 and 2004.

Detroit, Flint, Mich., and Oakland, Calif., rounded out the top five. For the
second straight year, the safest city with more than 75,000 residents was
Colonie, N.Y.

The annual rankings are based on population figures and crime data compiled by
the FBI. Some criminologists question the findings, saying the methodology is
unfair.

Greg Scarbro, unit chief of the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting Program, said the
FBI also discourages using the data for these types of rankings.

- the associated press

Kara Bowlin, spokeswoman for St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay, said the city
actually has been getting safer over the last few years. She said crime in St.
Louis has gone down each year since 2007, and so far in 2010, St. Louis crime is
down 7 percent.

Erica Van Ross, spokeswoman for the St. Louis Police Department, called the
rankings irresponsible.

"Crime is based on a variety of factors. It's based on geography, it's based on
poverty, it's based on the economy," Van Ross said.

"That is not to say that urban cities don't have challenges, because we do," Van
Ross said. "But it's that it's irresponsible to use the data in this way."

Falling U.S. Crime Rates - For Now

BYLINE: Editorial

SECTION: A; Pg. 9

LENGTH: 520  words

DATELINE: Lancaster, PA


When the economy goes down, crime goes up, right?

Apparently not, according to preliminary FBI crime figures for the first half of
2009, which show crime rates falling across the U.S.

The latest available figures follow a three-year trend of less violent crime,
fewer property crimes and fewer arson incidents.

This is so, despite the nation being in the throes of a recession, with high
unemployment, high home foreclosures and more people being forced into poverty
and having to accept food stamps.

Property crimes, in particular, normally rise in times of recession, but not
this time. Overall, property crimes fell nationwide by 6.1 percent.

Likewise, murder and manslaughter rates dropped precipitously - down 10 percent
from the previous period.

"That's a remarkable decline, given the economic conditions," Richard Rosenfeld,
a sociologist at the University of Missouri (St. Louis), said of the murder
rate.

More up-to-date figures bear this out.

New York City finished 2009 with the fewest murders - 466 - since comparable
record-keeping began in the 1960s. Overall crime in New York is down by 11
percent from the previous year and 35 percent from 2001.

At the same time, Los Angeles, which has been in an economic downturn as long
as, or longer than, any comparable city, is now in its eighth straight year of
crime decline.

In Philadelphia, violent crime is down 10 percent across the board.

Each city's data is different - smaller cities, including Lancaster, actually
showed a slight uptick in crime in 2009. But, collectively, the data pointed to
less crime in every major category.

The nation's falling crime rates run contrary to past recessions dating back to
the 1950s, when the rates were up in nearly every category. And today's rates
are nowhere near the peak reached in the early 1990s.

Why fewer crimes?

Police, particularly those in large cities, say they're doing a better job of
tracking developing crime patterns.

Sociologists, meantime, say extended unemployment benefits, food stamps and
other government giveaways have cushioned the blow of the recession, making it
less likely that people would become desperate and commit a crime.

With more people out of work and at home, the experts add, it's more difficult
for burglars to break in to a residence without being noticed by the homeowner
or neighbors.

New technology, including security-locking systems and car-recovery devices that
use the Global Positioning System, may help to explain the whopping 19 percent
drop in car thefts.

Then there's this: the graying of America. As the over-50 population increases,
crime goes down, even while health care and other social costs go up, the
experts say.

There are any number of possible explanations, but one thing is certain: Falling
crime rates are not sustainable. At some point in the future, they will start to
go back up. Unemployment checks and other government benefits run out
eventually.

This fact makes it all the more important that police and law-enforcement
officials not become complacent.

After all, statistics, whether up or down, mean little to the person who happens
to become a victim of crime.

Last year's crime rate holds to 30-year low

DATELINE: WASHINGTON


The nation's crime rate last year held steady at the lowest levels since the
government began surveying crime victims in 1973, the Justice Department
reported Sunday.

The study was the latest contribution to a decadelong trend in which violent
crime as measured by victim surveys has fallen by 55 percent and property crime
by 49 percent. That has included a 14 percent drop in violent crime from 2000-01
to 2002-03.

"The rates are the lowest experienced in the last 30 years," Justice Department
statistician Shannan Catalona said in the report. "Crime rates have stabilized."

The 2003 violent crime rate - assault, sexual assault and armed robbery - stood
at 22.6 victims for every 1,000 people age 12 and older. That amounts to about
one violent crime victim for every 44 U.S. residents.

By comparison, there were 23 violent crime victims per 1,000 people in 2002. In
1993, the violent crime rate was 50 per 1,000 people, or about one in every 20
people.

Murder is not counted because the Bureau of Justice Statistics study is based on
statements by crime victims. In a separate report based on preliminary police
data, the FBI found a 1.3 percent increase in murders between 2002 and 2003 -
from 16,200 to about 16,420.

The new survey put the rate for property crimes of burglary, theft and motor
vehicle theft in 2003 at 163 for every 1,000 people, compared with 159 the year
before. The slight increase was not considered statistically significant.

A decade ago, there were about 319 property crimes per 1,000 people, the study
said.

Study: Prices would help people trim power use

WASHINGTON - People could save as much as $15-billion annually if they had more
information about fluctuations in the price of electricity and then acted to cut
power usage when prices were expected to be high, congressional investigators
conclude.

In a study examining experimental programs in real-time power-pricing, they said
widespread use of "demand-response" programs would cut electricity bills and
ease pressure on grid systems during peak demand periods.

The study by the Government Accountability Office focused on pilot programs in
New York, Georgia, Florida and New York. It examined power costs for 53
government buildings, about two-thirds of which participated in programs where
electricity use could be reduced at a time when the cost was expected to be
highest.

FIRE KILLS 10: A suspected arson fire raced through an apartment complex in
suburban Columbus, Ohio, on Sunday, killing 10 people who lived in the same
apartment and forcing others to jump from third-story windows to escape.  At
least 53 people were left homeless by the blaze, which destroyed the building's
roof and third floor, melted siding and left its wooden skeleton exposed.

Crime rate stabilizes after years of declining;
Murder rates drop in 3 big Georgia cities

SOURCE: From News Services

SECTION: News; Pg. 8A

LENGTH: 522 words


Washington --- After declining dramatically over the last several years, violent
crimes in America increased marginally in 2000, preliminary FBI crime figures
show.

Statistics for murders, rapes and other violent crimes last year, which were
released Wednesday, represented the first indication that a significant series
of decreases in crime in the early 1990s has essentially bottomed out,
criminologists said.

"I cannot imagine any clearer indication that the crime drop is over," said
professor James Alan Fox of Northeastern University in Boston.

Preliminary figures released by the FBI for last year show violent crime
increased 0.1 percent, while the overall crime index was unchanged from 1999.

Regionally, law enforcement agencies in the Northeast and Midwest reported
declines in crime of 2.4 percent and 1.1 percent, respectively.

Crime rose 1.1 percent in the West and 1 percent in the South.

But the number of murders dropped in three major Georgia cities from 1999 to
2000: 143 to 134 in Atlanta, 39 to 32 in Savannah and 28 to 15 in Macon.

Experts in the field had attributed the violent crime declines of the 1990s to a
number of factors, including the maturing of a large teenage population and a
strong economy.

Republicans regularly acknowledged those trends during the years of the Clinton
presidency, but said they believed the trends weren't directly the result of
Democratic policies. Republicans argued, instead, that the declines resulted
from tougher enforcement of the law, increased prison capacity and sterner
sentences for repeat offenders.

Skeptics have cautioned for years against using data from the FBI survey as the
sole measure of crime in the nation because it tracks only those crimes reported
to police.

Some crime victimization studies have estimated that fewer than half of all
violent crimes are reported to police and that the reporting is worst in poor
areas, where the most crimes occur.

Still, the FBI survey provides the most complete measure of crimes reported to
law enforcement agencies and is closely monitored by criminologists and
sociologists.

Murders in 2000 fell 1.1 percent compared with the previous year, the new FBI
figures showed, and robberies dropped 0.7 percent. Forcible rape increased 0.7
percent and aggravated assault rose 0.4 percent.

Motor vehicle theft rose 2.7 percent and larceny-theft increased 0.1 percent.

Though the increases were small, they contrasted sharply with declines recorded
in previous years.

Last year, for instance, the FBI said the burglary rate fell 10 percent, the
auto theft rate fell 7.7 percent and the larceny-theft rate fell 5.7 percent.

In some categories, the reversals were profound. For instance, murders in big
cities with more than 1 million residents rose 2.5 percent in 2000. In 1999, the
murder rate had fallen by 4 percent compared with the previous year.

The rates are based on reports from 17,000 city, county and state law
enforcement agencies.

Final figures for 2000 will be released in the fall, the FBI said.

HENDERSON REJECTS LABEL OF CRIME CAPITAL;
CRIMINOLOGISTS, FBI AGREE THAT JUGGLING STATISTICS IS UNFAIR TO ST. LOUIS

BYLINE: Bill Bryan; Of The Post-Dispatch

SECTION: METRO, Pg. B1

LENGTH: 511 words


Like the nation as a whole, St. Louis has enjoyed a continuing drop in crime
over the past several years. Criminologists call the trend remarkable.

The city crime decline matched the newly reported national decrease of about 7
percent for 1999. And although St. Louis murders were up last year -- 130,
compared with 113 in 1998 -- the year's homicide total was the third-lowest
since 1966.

So why was Police Chief Ron Henderson wearing a scowl Monday?

It was because news reporters in some cities took the new FBI statistics on
large cities, did some simple arithmetic with population numbers and created per
capita figures that rank St. Louis No. 1 in crime among U.S. cities with 100,000
or more residents. The story has been broadly circulated.

"It simply isn't fair," Henderson said Monday.

The FBI and a noted local crime scholar agreed with him.

Richard Rosenfeld, a criminologist at the University of Missouri at St. Louis,
said, "Comparing St. Louis with other cities is misleading. St. Louis'
configuration is very different: the core city is a very small fraction of the
metropolitan area. In other metro areas, the core city comprises a much larger
fraction."

Complained Henderson: "These rankings are not an accurate reflection of our
city. We've had a steady decline in crime, and in most years we've beaten the
national average.

"We're a closely condensed urban area. We're not like other cities that have
suburban-type neighborhoods to offset some of the crime numbers. We're 61 square
miles and we're locked in and boxed in."

The FBI recognizes the unfairness of city-to-city rankings and in fact does not
provide them. The agency "strongly discourages" others from using its Uniform
Crime Reporting data that way.

"These crude and-or incomplete analyses have often created misleading
perceptions which adversely affect geographic entities and their residents," an
FBI warning with the statistics says.

"For this reason, the FBI has a long-standing policy against ranking cities,
counties, states and universities-colleges on the basis of crime data alone.
Despite repeated warnings against these practices, this position continues to be
challenged and misunderstood by crime data users."

The FBI said differences in demographics, economic conditions, transportation
systems, family characteristics and even climate weigh against fair comparisons.
Nonresident shoppers and workers may have a dramatic effect on crime but not be
reflected in population statistics.

Rosenfeld pointed out that the St. Louis resident population gets smaller each
year. "People who leave the city first are the more prosperous and the less
prone to committing crime," he suggested.

"It would be more appropriate to compare metropolitan areas. The functional city
doesn't stop at Skinker Boulevard," Rosenfeld added.

He noted that St. Louis has "dramatically lower crime rates" over recent years.

"I wouldn't attribute much significance to the rankings," Rosenfeld concluded.
"What's important is that crime goes down."

Don't let hate-crime laws undermine freedoms

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 12A

LENGTH: 325 words


Todd Mitchell knows firsthand the penalty for adding insult to injury.

In 1989, the then 19-year-old black Kenosha, Wis., teen-ager and a group of his
friends were leaving a viewing of the movie Mississippi Burning when a white
youth walked by.

"Do you all feel hyped up to move on some white people?" Mitchell asked. He
ordered his friends to "go get him."

The youth suffered lasting head injuries, and Mitchell was sentenced to four
years in prison - two for battery and an extra two under a Wisconsin law that
adds punishment for crimes motivated by hate. Twenty-six other states and the
District of Columbia have similar laws.

Today, the Supreme Court hears arguments on the constitutionality of the
Wisconsin law. The court would be wise to strike it down.

Any violent crime - including those committed against people because of their
race, gender or sexual orientation - is deplorable and cannot be tolerated.

But society gains nothing by punishing the thought behind the act - and doing so
brings needless risks.

Would Mitchell's crime have been any less horrible if he had beaten someone
senseless for a different reason?

Would hate laws be applied evenly - or would they be used differently when the
victim is black and the villain white?

Could states add punishments for racially motivated trespassing, or
demonstrating - the kind of actions at the heart of the civil rights movement
and critical to free speech?

Those are troubling questions that the nation doesn't need to take on.

The rise in hate crimes is indeed alarming. But the most effective way to fight
back is with tough laws that punish the crimes, and not with easily abused laws
that punish the hate behind them.

Last year the court struck down a St. Paul, Minn., ordinance that banned
racially offensive acts such as burning crosses or displaying swastikas. The
Wisconsin law also should die.

A crime is a crime, whether hate is behind it or not.

No time for 'Crime' on NBC this summer

BYLINE: Peter Johnson; Brian Donlon

SECTION: LIFE; Pg. 3D

LENGTH: 659 words


NBC executives wanted to launch a Law & Order spinoff, Crime and Punishment,
after the Olympics as a short-order summer series. But that's not going to
happen.

''I said, 'Why push it?' '' says Law and Crime executive producer Dick Wolf. ''I
don't know if summertime is the time to launch a heavy drama.''

Instead, Crime will live as a midseason entry, beginning shooting Sept. 9. But
Wolf says to discount the spinoff label.

''It's really a bookend,'' says Wolf of Crime, which will be shot in Los
Angeles. (Law is shot in New York). And, while Law splits the hour between the
investigation of a crime by the police and the prosecution of the crime by the
district attorney's office, Crime spends its first half with the criminal
plotting the crime and its second half with the detectives solving it.

''There's never been a serious cop show of the tonality of Law & Order, NYPD and
Naked City done about Los Angeles,'' Wolf says, and he hopes Crime will be it.
Rachel Ticotin (co-star of Total Recall) and Jon Tenney (late of ABC's Equal
Justice) play the detective team.

NEW SEASON: And now, some thoughts from several Madison Avenue prognosticators
regarding the upcoming fall schedule. Starting off are the folks at Young &
Rubicam , who predict there'll be ''no runaway hits'' among 35 new shows
premiering. Y&R says the highest shares will go to two new CBS Monday sitcoms,
Love and War and Hearts Afire. Y&R also predicts CBS will finish the season in
first place, followed by NBC and ABC. Meanwhile, Backer Spielvogel Bates agrees
CBS will be in first.

Y&R notes that network schedules are more concentrated than ever on youth, with
14 new shows targeted to them. Networks are also engaging more black performers
than ever before. BSB vice president Bob Silberberg says ABC's Hangin' With Mr.
Cooper should do well because it'll air between hits Full House and Roseanne.
''If it had to stand on its own, (it) probably would not do as well,'' he says.
He gives thumbs down to ABC's much anticipated Delta, starring Delta Burke,
predicting it'll ''trail all of the competition, including Fox.'' Other possible
hits: Fox's Melrose Place, NBC's Rhythm and Blues and CBS' Western drama with
Jane Seymour, Dr. Quinn: Medicine Woman, which Silberberg says ''could
surprise'' and finish second in the Saturday at 9 ET/PT time period.

COURT DATES: Looks like high profile trials are quite the rage these days. On
the heels of Court TV's plans to air the American Bar Association's trial of Lee
Harvey Oswald on Aug. 10-11 comes word that Arts & Entertainment is getting into
the act, too. On Aug. 7, it'll present The Trials of Claus von Bulow as part of
its weekly anthology series, Time Machine With Jack Perkins. The hourlong
program uses actual footage from the trial to recount the story of the wealthy
socialite accused of attempted murder of his wife. The case was the basis of the
feature film Reversal of Fortune, for which Jeremy Irons won an Oscar for best
actor playing Claus von Bulow.

BRIEFLY: Bill Clinton and Al Gore, their sights sets on the White House, will be
sole guests for the entire CBS This Morning Aug. 10, which will feature a live
audience. ... Beverly Hills, 90210 star Jennie Garth, jet skiiing last week in
the Pacific with Luke Perry for a scene, was shaken up a bit after she fell off
and hit her head on the ski. ... CBS has asked Paramount to put together a Taxi
reunion show. Interesting, since Taxi aired on ABC and NBC, but never on CBS.
... NBC Nightly News is enjoying a nice boost from the Olympics. Overnight
25-city ratings show Nightly was up 34% Monday compared with a week ago. ABC's
top-rated World News Tonight was down 3% and The CBS Evening News up 3%. ...
Finally, Tonight Show host Jay Leno sent a case of Raisinettes to Nightly anchor
Tom Brokaw as thanks for his nightly commentary on Tonight during the Democratic
convention. Why Raisinettes? Because Brokaw likes 'em.

Question: How can citizens help prevent crime in their communities?

There is a concept called the extended family that we've gotten away from. If
there was a crime taking place on the street today, people wouldn't go in and
assist. But if people would take care of each other, that would deter crime.
It's a human obligation to do everything possible to help someone.

Michael Kinney, 30

If individuals become a little more involved in making their own neighborhoods
safe and in assisting the police and other local authorities, that will be a
step in the right direction.

Zuriel Bourne, 31

Basically, I think they can aid by knowing more about people in their
communities. They should know who is supposed to be there and who is not. Most
people don't pay attention to these people and they watch them walk in and out
without saying or doing anything.

Gail Jantz, 45
Teacher
Espanola, Wash.

I firmly believe that we, as citizens, have to get involved, and we have to help
if we see something going on. We also have to do more to educate our children to
make them aware of what could happen, and give them the tools to handle it if
something does happen to them personally.

Jerry Sharp, 54

Columbia, Miss.

I think they have to bring about an awareness that as citizens they can do
something. Neighborhoods should still be neighborhoods. People should support
each other, they should band together and take action when action is needed.

Bill would require colleges to disclose campus crime

BYLINE: Chet Lunner

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 6A

LENGTH: 315 words


A bill requiring colleges to publicly report campus crimes could be on President
Bush's desk next week.

Spurred by the murders of five Florida students, the Senate and the House have
passed different versions of the bill modeled after laws recently passed in 10
states.

It's now in the hands of a House-Senate conference committee working out the
differences.

The federal law would require colleges to provide students, applicants and
employees an annual report on security policies and violent crime statistics.
Failure to comply would jeopardize federal aid.

It's part of a crusade by Constance and Howard Clery, whose daughter Jeanne was
raped and strangled in a dormitory room at Lehigh University, Bethlehem, Pa.

Congressional staffers hammering out a final version expect swift passage, after
stripping language - opposed by the Bush administration - that would have forced
the Department of Education to publish a nationwide compilation of campus crime
statistics. Supporters say they plan to publish the data privately.

''Making this information available will encourage students to take security
precautions,'' says Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., ''and will encourage higher
education institutions to pay careful attention to security considerations.''

Co-sponsor Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., cited a 1988 USA TODAY campus crime survey
that found 31 students killed, 653 rapes, and 1,800 armed robberies.

The bill also would require colleges to report, by race and sex, graduation
rates for all students and for athletes.

Increase in Urban Crime Is Found to Be Nationwide

BYLINE: By Thomas O'Toole, Washington Post Staff Writer

SECTION: First Section; A3

LENGTH: 562 words


Crime has grown at a rapid rate in all of America's cities, regardless of their
size, location, minority populations or whether they are gaining or losing
population.

It no longer is a local problem to be dealt with on a local level but is a
nationwide phenomenon growing at almost the same rate from Long Island to Los
Angeles, beyond the control of local governments.

These are some of the surprising conclusions of a 3 1/2-year study done for the
Justice Department by Northwestern University's Center for Urban Affairs and
Policy Research.

"The growth of crime appears to be the result of fundamental changes in the life
styles of Americans," write Drs. Herbert Jacob and Robert L. Lineberry, who
conducted the $923,000 study for the National Institute of Justice. "It is the
result of greater affluence which made more valuable goods available for theft,
a condition aggravated by the greater propensity of Americans to leave goods
unguarded in empty homes and expose themselves to dangerous situations in
traveling around their cities.

"It is also the consequence," Jacob and Lineberry go on, "of there being a
larger pool of potential offenders for reasons not well understood by
criminologists."

The result of all this, the two political scientists say, is that "crime has
surged everywhere in the U.S. regardless of local efforts to stem the flood
tide. Whether local officials engaged in herculean efforts or none at all, the
crime wave affected their community."

The Northwestern study covers the 31 years from 1948 through 1978 and involves
396 cities, every city in the country with more than 50,000 residents. In-depth
studies were done of 10 cities, those with declining populations like Newark,
Philadelphia and Boston, booming dynamos like Phoenix, Houston and San Jose,
distressed cities like Atlanta and Oakland and relatively well-off cities like
Indianapolis and Minneapolis.

Jacob and Lineberry say their study shows a remarkably similar rise in crime
rates for cities that bear no resemblance to each other: "Both the Newarks and
the Houstons of the United States experienced substantial rises in their
reported crime rates. Those increases, moreover, occurred at about the same time
and with the same velocity for all kinds of cities."

All 10 cities studied in depth suffered huge increases in their crime rates over
the three decades covered. Newark suffered the most, a sevenfold increase in
property crime and an elevenfold rise in violent crime. But the thriving cities
of San Jose and Phoenix saw property crime more than double and violent crime
more than quadruple.

Jacob and Lineberry downplay the role of race in the rise of crime but do not
dismiss it.

"Cities which have large fractions of their population that are non-white
generally have higher rates for violent crimes," the two political scientists
say. "This relationship is much stronger than the relationship between the size
of the non-white population and the property crime rate."

Jacob and Lineberry also downplay the roles that age and poverty play in the
rising crime rate.

On youth: "At no time did the proportion of the youthful population account for
as much as 5 percent of the variance in either violent or property crime rates."
On poverty: "The number of poor people in a city is only marginally related to
either property or violent crime.

El Paso ranked as "most vigilant city" in the nation

El Paso is ranked the No.1 city in working to prevent crime.

"Considering the city's well-known reputation for having little crime and being
very safe, it makes sense that El Paso was able to ascend to the top ranking on
our list," stated the rankings by MyLife.com.

The list for the "10 Most Vigilant Cities" was released Monday by MyLife.com, a
website that offers online identity services and regularly features city
rankings on a variety of topics.

The rankings looked at the nation's 100 largest cities. The list was compiled

THE NATION: Season of Fear;
Polititians Feel a Crime-Induced Chill in the Air

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE

SECTION: Section 4; Page 1; Column 1; Week In Review Desk

LENGTH: 1227 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON


IT could be your next-door neighbor describing her fear for the safety of her
teen-agers when they leave the house on weekend nights -- but it isn't. It's
Christine Todd Whitman, the Republican candidate for Governor of New Jersey,
looking squarely into the camera as she tries to convince voters that she is not
soft on crime, as Gov. Jim Florio would have them believe.

"As Governor," she says in a new campaign ad, "nobody will be tougher than me on
drunk drivers and criminals, especially those who prey on women and children."

Mrs. Whitman did not have to emphasize her point with the usual campaign-season
props of bloodied bodies and blaring sirens. People are already afraid.

Crime, always a potent political issue, has taken on a chilling new character
for many Americans. In the public imagination, hard-core criminals can no longer
be expected to simply rob and kill; they now seem to carry out their deeds with
unparalleled wantonness, even exultation, and the criminal-justice system, when
not directly part of the problem, hardly seems up to the challenge.

Many recent episodes are feeding the fear: There was the Mayor of Washington,
D.C., Sharon Pratt Kelly, on Friday asking President Clinton for authority to
call out the National Guard to combat the city's soaring homicide rate. There
was the Reginald Denny beating case, which ended in Los Angeles last week with
convictions of his assailants, but not on the most serious charges against them
-- despite what to many people was damning videotaped evidence of brutality
against the truck driver followed by a jig of glee. (Details of the verdict,
page 2.) There was the police beating of Rodney King before that, and the
initial acquittals of the officers that touched off the Los Angeles riots in the
first place. There were the highway killings of foreign tourists in Florida, and
the torching there of a black tourist from New York (bringing life sentences for
his assailants last week). There was the roadside murder of the father of the
basketball star Michael Jordan. Carjackings. The list goes on and on.

Like Mayor Kelly, politicians around the nation, many with an eye to Election
Day a week from Tuesday, are responding to the perception that violent crime has
sped out of control and that the criminal-justice system in many cases has
broken down (witness the recent hearings on police corruption in New York City).

Last week Attorney General Janet Reno pointedly placed a large share of blame on
television, warning industry executives that if they didn't tone down televised
violence, the Government would compel them to.

In gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia and in mayoral races in New
York, Detroit, Miami and other cities, the heightened debate over crime has
brought to the fore not so much new remedies but age-old tensions between
Republicans and Democrats: Do you lock up more offenders? Hand out stiffer
sentences? Or should the priority be getting guns off the streets?

Gun Control Gains Favor

As the New Jersey race illustrates, the Democrats have the potential to make the
issue their own as the National Rifle Association loses clout and as voters
favor measures like the ban pushed through by Mr. Florio on certain
semiautomatic weapons. Paradoxically, Republicans used to point to Democrats'
support for gun control as evidence that they were soft on law and order. A test
for Democrats in Congress is whether, after years of failed efforts, they can
pass a strong anti-crime package this year.

Inescapably, the debate over crime has been complicated by the issue of race.
The revulsion over the Los Angeles riots helped the election of Mayor Richard
Riordan, a self-described law-and-order politician and the first Republican to
hold that office in a generation. In the mayoral race in New York, there are
tensions over whether the tough-on-crime stance of Rudolph W. Giuliani, the
Republican challenging Mayor David N. Dinkins, is a subtle appeal to prejudice.

"We've seen a difference in the nature of crime -- a bravado where you've got
juveniles who have no fears," said Charles M. Oberly, the Attorney General of
Delaware who is running as a Democrat for Senate next year. "It's an expedient
political issue: What else do you tell people when you can't get them jobs and
you've got an economy that's stagnant? So there's fear-mongering going on, and
the public is ripe for it."

While the nation's overall crime rate dropped slightly in 1992 -- the first time
it had not increased in eight years -- the most violent crimes, especially rape
and aggravated assault, continued to rise, according to the F.B.I.'s Uniform
Crime Report.

In politics, in any case, it is perceptions that count. So as people buy up
burglar alarms in record numbers, they say in surveys that they feel less safe,
even in their own homes, than ever before. In a poll conducted last April by L.
H. Research for the Harvard School of Public Health, 94 percent of Americans
said crime had gotten worse in comparison with the time they were growing up.

Mark Melman, a Democratic pollster, said crime is the No. 1 issue for mayoral
candidates he is advising this year in Seattle and New Orleans, but not because
crime is on the rise. "The real crime rate and peoples' perceptions are two
different things," he said.

Already, Democrats are upbeat about their fortunes. Recalling that Mr. Clinton
got a standing ovation when he mentioned the crime issue at a dinner for Senate
Democrats, Don Foley, the executive director of the Democratic Senatorial
Campaign, said: "That's something I didn't expect to see from a Democratic
audience in my lifetime." As the Democrats grow more comfortable with the issue,
Republicans seem increasingly uneasy. Just as they moderated their opposition to
abortion four years ago, many are changing tack on gun control now. Gov. William
F. Weld of Massachusetts, a Republican, reversed himself last month and proposed
some of the most stringent gun control laws in the country.

Yet many Republicans are still torn over how best to shore up their reputation
for toughness on crime. Haley Barbour, the Republican Party chairman, echoed the
Democrats' dire concerns about crime, but made clear that a call for gun control
was not part of his pitch.

"In some parts of Washington, D.C., people say they are afraid to go out of
their houses," he said, dismissing the city's gun control law. "And they know
that the only way that you're going to do something about that is to have sure
and severe punishment to violent criminals."

Stuart A. Scheingold, a professor at the University of Washington who
specializes in crime and politics, has little patience for candidates who are
talking up crime. "This is all symbolic," he said. "But everybody's avoiding the
really tough issues of addressing the fundamental social conditions that are
breeding this."

As an example, the much-promoted Clinton crime bill, which would extend the
death penalty to 50 crimes, has been criticized as a rehash of a proposal by
President Bush.

For now, many politicians are doing little more about crime than making
commercials. In a spot strikingly similar to Mrs. Whitman's, Mayor Norm Rice of
Seattle, a Democrat, strolls through a residential neighborhood, assuring
voters: "I hear you. These are our streets. And we must take them back."

Albany Reports a Rise in Crime In All Areas but New York City

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL,  Special to The New York Times

SECTION: Section B; Page 6; Column 1; Metropolitan Desk

LENGTH: 503 words

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 9


Reported crime declined in New York City last year, but increased everywhere
else in the state, according to statistics released today. State officials said
the trend might be caused in part by the migration of criminal activity from New
York City to suburban and upstate communities.

New York City still accounted for 65 percent of the crimes reported in the state
in 1991, according to the figures, which were released by the State Division of
Criminal Justice Services. But while crime in the city fell in 1991 by about 4.4
percent compared with 1990, it rose by 3.9 percent everywhere else.

Close to New York City, the number of crimes reported increased by 2.4 percent
in Nassau County and by 2.6 percent in Westchester County, suggesting, officials
said, that some criminals may have moved their operations from the city to the
suburbs.  The Suffolk County police have not yet reported their crime figures to
the state agency.

Overall Decline

Driven by the declines in New York City, reported crime throughout the state
fell by 1.7 percent from the 1990 level, the division said. The statistics were
compiled from law-enforcement agencies around the state and track the number of
crimes that people reported to the police, rather than arrests or convictions.

"What this tells us is that many of the crime problems we thought were only
associated with New York City are also being experienced by other parts of the
state," said Richard H. Girgenti, the Commissioner of Criminal Justice Services.

Mr. Girgenti cautioned against reading too much into the figures until a few
years' statistics have been compiled. "I would hesitate to draw too much of a
conclusion from this until we have a chance to see more than one year's data to
determine whether we have a trend or not," he said.

But he said the statistics seemed to show that while crime may have peaked in
New York City, other areas -- both large cities around the state and suburban
communities close to New York City -- are beginning to reach the point that the
city did several years ago.

For instance, he said, the number of new crack addicts in New York City has been
declining steadily. But the police in Buffalo first began to report problems
with crack about six or eight months ago.

"To some extent, there's an attempt to identify new markets, like with any
business," Mr. Girgenti said. "We've seen a lot of people expanding their drug
gang action, and we've seen some crime migrating."

Thomas A. Reppetto, president of the Citizens Crime Commission, an independent
agency that tracks crime statistics, said the apparent shift in criminal
activity could result in part from an increased police presence in New York City
that may have pushed drug traffickers out of the city and into upstate
communities like Rochester and Buffalo.

"You have to ask why they are operating there and not in New York City," Mr.
Reppetto said. "It could be that increased police activity has made New York
City a little too hot for them."

WHAT A HANDGUN BAN DIDN'T DO FOR WASHINGTON

SECTION: Section A; Page 24, Column 5; Editorial Desk

LENGTH: 283 words


To the Editor:

The Times should not be so blithe in accepting the conclusion of the Handgun
Control Committee of the U.S. Conference of Mayors that Washington's
three-year-old handgun ban has both saved lives and reduced crime in that city
(editorial July 8).

he D.C. Police Department didn't come to the same conclusion, nor did The
Washington Post or The Washington Star. Both papers, whose editorial policies
are in step with the ''gun control'' movement, cited numerous other factors,
such as tough handling of repeat offenders and increased police visibility in
high-crime areas.

But none of this is really to the point. The fact is that all violent crime in
the District went up after the gun ban went into effect. The murder rate went up
2 percent, robbery 5 percent and aggravated assault 19 percent. These data were
not distilled from thin air. They are supplied by the F.B.I.'s Uniform Crime
Report.  Furthermore, crime rates in the Virginia and Maryland suburbs, which do
not ''enjoy'' the D.C. ban, are going down.

A final note: Robert Nicholson, co-author of the Conference of Mayors' report,
admitted that its conclusion, tying the crime rate to the gun law, was reached,
''with a leap of hope or faith.'' That may be good Reformation theology, but
it's a terrible way to promote public policy.  PAUL C. STONE Communications

The persistence of American hate; While the number of active hate groups in the
U.S. has fallen in recent years, the hate crime rate remains steady and blacks
remain the racial group most likely to experience racially motivated violence.
After Wednesday night's mass shooting in Charleston, S.C., the Washington Post
offers some context on hate crimes and hate groups from the Southern Poverty Law
Center, the FBI and other sources

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. D2

Blacks experience the most hate crime FBI hate crime data show that more than 50
out of every one million black citizens were the victims of racially motivated
hate crimes in 2012, the highest among any racial group. But this is almost
certainly an undercount. The FBI is reliant on state and local law enforcement
agencies to categorize and report hate crimes correctly. Some agencies do a much
better job of this than others, and there is general agreement that the FBI
numbers are significantly lower than they should be.

Crime rates stable over pas t decade The Bureau of Justice Statistics provides
the most comprehensive overall count of hate crime incidents. Their data, drawn
from interviews with victims, shows the number of hate crimes occurring has
remained fairly constant over the past 10 years, hovering between 200,000 and
300,000 annually. Number of active hate groups down in recent years.

According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, the number of active hate groups,
which it defines as "groups have beliefs or practices that attack or malign an
entire class of people, typically for their immutable characteristics," more
than doubled from 457 in 1999 to 1018 in 2011. Since then the number of active
groups has declined to 784.

The SPLC attributes this to various causes - including an improving economy and
recent law enforcement crackdowns, as well as widespread internecine squabbling
and

splintering within the groups themselves.

Groups thrive in Deep South and Northern Plains Hate groups aren't distributed
evenly by geography. Controlling for the population in each state, hate groups
are concentrated most in the Deep South and in the Montana/Idaho region.

Vermont and New Hampshire also stand out. Partially, this is a function of low
population - Vermont has fewer than 700,000 residents, which combined with its
four active hate groups gives it a high per-capita value. But this may not just
be an artifact of low population. Researchers at Humboldt State University
recently mapped geocoded tweets containing hate speech, and their map does
appear to show a high incidence of hate-tweets originating in Vermont.

Hardship breeds hatred Researchers have tried to suss out the causes of hate
crime over the years. A 2002 review of hate crime literature by Princeton
economist Alan Krueger looked at the economic determinants of hate crime -
whether these crimes rose and fell in response to economic conditions like
poverty rate and unemployment.

Krueger concludes that "rather than economic conditions, the hate crimes
literature points to a breakdown in law enforcement and official sanctioning and
encouragement

of civil disobedience as significant causes of the occurrence of hate crimes."
Not so fast, say economists Matt Ryan and Peter Leeson. In 2010 they examined
the links between hate groups and hate crime in the United States.

Perhaps surprisingly, they find no relationship between the number of hate
groups in a state, and the number of hate crimes that occur within that state in
a given year.

Instead, the primary determinants seem to be economic. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2015

St. Louis tops list of most dangerous American cities

LENGTH: 240 words


TRENTON, N.J. ? St. Louis overtook Camden, N.J., as the nation's most dangerous
city in 2009, according to a national study released Sunday.

The study by CQ Press found St. Louis had 2,070.1 violent crimes per 100,000
residents, compared with a national average of 429.4. That helped St. Louis beat
out Camden, which topped last year's list and was the most dangerous city for
2003 and 2004. Detroit, Flint, Mich., and Oakland, Calif., rounded out the top
five. For the second straight year, the safest city with more than 75,000
residents was Colonie, N.Y. The annual rankings are based on population figures
and crime data compiled by the FBI. Some criminologists question the findings,
saying the methodology is unfair. Greg Scarbro, unit chief of the FBI's Uniform
Crime Reporting Program, said the FBI also discourages using the data for these
types of rankings. Kara Bowlin, spokeswoman for St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay,
said the city actually has been getting safer over the last few years. She said
crime in St. Louis has gone down each year since 2007, and so far in 2010, St.
Louis crime is down 7 percent. Erica Van Ross, spokeswoman for the St. Louis
Police Department, called the rankings irresponsible. "Crime is based on a
variety of factors. It's based on geography, it's based on poverty, it's based
on the economy," Van Ross said. "That is not to say that urban cities don't have
challenges, because we do," Van Ross said.

Serious crimes drop in Mesa since 2006

BYLINE: Mike Sakal, The Tribune, Mesa, Ariz.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 457 words


Jul. 21--Serious crime in Mesa is down 13 percent this year compared with the
same time in 2008, according to police department statistics released Tuesday.

The drop in major crimes for the first six months of this year is even larger
when compared with 2006, when crimes such as homicides, sexual assaults,
aggravated assaults, robberies, burglaries and property crimes were 31 percent
higher.

The statistics were announced by Mesa police Chief George Gascon during a press
conference he described as "bittersweet." Gascon, who took the top job in Mesa
in 2006, is leaving at the end of the week to be the police chief in San
Francisco. Also at the press conference, Gascon formally introduced Mesa's
interim chief, Vicki Myers, though she had been appointed weeks earlier.

The current crime numbers translate into 38 crimes per 1,000 residents in a city
of slightly more than 450,000 residents.

"Our goal was to get it down in the 30s," Gascon said. "When I came here in
2006, I said Mesa had way too much crime for a city of its demographics."

When Gascon began his stint as police chief in Mesa, he said, the city was
experiencing 52 to 54 serious crimes per 1,000 residents, a number that was
higher comparably to New York and Los Angeles.

"None of this stuff happens by accident," Gascon said of Mesa's reduction in
serious crime that he said has dropped to levels seen in 1963, when the city had
about 60,000 people. "This happens because a lot of people have worked very hard
and committed themselves to make this happen."

Gascon also said he was proud of his department for reducing crime while
focusing on problem areas during a time of budget cuts every year since he's
been chief.

The chief said his department focused on dismantling organized crime syndicates,
gang activity and taking repeat offenders off the streets.

Murder is up, FBI confirms;
Agency statistics also show a drop in property crime

BYLINE: DAVID HUNT

SECTION: Pg. B-1

LENGTH: 636 words


Murder, rape, robbery and burglary are on the rise in Jacksonville, but
aggravated assault and property crimes are down, according to FBI statistics
released Monday.

The increase in violent crime in Jacksonville came despite a $5 million budget
boost last year aimed at fighting the city's rising murder rate.

Sheriff John Rutherford said Monday the money put more officers on the street
and helped participation in community-based police programs. Of the money, $3
million came from a city reserve and $2 million was redirected by the governor
from a state fund.

Rutherford credits the money for reducing the murder rate by 40 percent in the
second half of 2006, adding that the police may have gone wrong in not beefing
up community police efforts sooner.

The increase in violent crime amounted to about 1 percent overall, but
Rutherford said he fears it could be signifying worse years ahead.

"This is a 1 percent increase in violent crime after 15 or 16 years of decline.
I'm very concerned that we've hit bottom," he said.

Still, an analysis of those numbers by the Times-Union shows Jacksonville as a
comparatively safer place to live than some of the other major cities in the
region - even those with falling violent crime rates.

The numbers suggest 837 violent incidents happen for every 100,000 people living
in Jacksonville. Indianapolis, a city roughly Jacksonville's size, has a violent
crime rate of 993 incidents for every 100,000 people. Louisville, Ky., numbers
suggest 625 violent crimes for every 100,000 citizens. In Miami, the number per
100,000 is 1,509.

The numbers also showed property crimes, including vehicle thefts and arson,
fell by about 400 incidents in Jacksonville.

The numbers show violent crime overall in Jacksonville went from 6,600 incidents
in 2005 to 6,663 in 2006. Murders jumped from 91 to 110, rapes from 189 to 218
and robberies from 2,253 to 2,304. Aggravated assaults showed a slight drop from
4,067 to 4,031.

Talk about property tax reform in Tallahassee could leave Rutherford with fewer
dollars to fight an increase in violence he sees only getting worse.

The Florida Legislature is scheduled to resume property tax reform talks next
week. Although a plan has not been approved, the city has anticipated losing up
to $50 million in property tax revenue on top of a projected deficit of $25
million.

"We don't need to be cutting," Rutherford said. "We need to be adding."

But he said he considers the police just one facet in fighting the city's crime.
Cuts to other areas like education and mental health could create spikes in
violent crime numbers even if more police officers are put on the streets, he
said.

"The gratuitous nature of violence is changing," he said. "What might have once
involved a fistfight before has now devolved into shooting."

Rutherford's budget represents roughly half the overall city budget, said Susie
Wiles, a spokeswoman for Mayor John Peyton. She said Peyton considers public
safety of high importance and would like the cuts to be to programs in the
Sheriff's Office, not personnel.

By law, the city has to have a balanced budget by next month. With no clear
property tax reform plan in place in the Legislature, Jacksonville officials
aren't sure exactly how much trimming must be done.

"It's a very, very difficult conundrum," Wiles said. "Exactly how we're going to
deal with it, we don't know."

LENGTH: 305  words


WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP) - Murders, robberies and aggravated assaults in the United
States increased last year, spurring an overall rise in violent crime for the
first time since 2001, according to FBI data.

Murders rose 4.8 percent, meaning there were more than 16,900 victims in 2005.
That would be the most since 1998 and the largest percentage increase in 15
years.

Murders jumped from 272 to 334 in Houston, a 23 percent spike; from 330 to 377
in Philadelphia, a 14 percent rise; and from 131 to 144 in Las Vegas, a 10
percent increase.

Despite the national numbers, Detroit, Los Angeles and New York were among
several large cities that saw the number of murders drop.

The overall increase in violent crime was modest, 2.5 percent, which equates to
more than 1.4 million crimes. Nevertheless, that was the largest percentage
increase since 1991.

The FBI data, compiled from reports by more than 12,000 law enforcement
agencies, does not contain overall crime numbers in any category nor does it
offer any explanation for the changes. The FBI's final annual crime report comes
out in the fall.

Criminal justice experts said the statistics reflect the nation's complacency in
fighting crime, a product of dramatic declines in the 1990s and the abandonment
of effective programs that emphasized prevention, putting more police officers
on the street and controlling the spread of guns.

"We see that budgets for policing are being slashed and the federal government
has gotten out of that business," said James Alan Fox, a criminal justice
professor at Northeastern University in Boston. "Funding for prevention at the
federal level and many localities are down and the (National Rifle Association)
has renewed strength."

Still, Fox said, "We're still far better off than we were during the
double-digit crime inflation we saw in the 1970s."

New city team ready to pounce on crime

DATELINE: DAYTONA BEACH


DAYTONA BEACH Theres a new team in town, and they dont intend to give crime a
sporting chance. Police Chief Dennis Jones announced the start of a Crime Team
on Monday aimed at combining efforts from all city departments to slash crime in
Daytona Beach by at least 20 percent. Although the police chief expects new
statistics to show some improvement, Daytona Beach ranked as Floridas
second-most violent city with a population of at least 50,000. Jones said the
whole city must face up to the problem.

Its going to be a different approach to just saying this is a Police Department
problem, Jones said. Its a community-wide problem. The plan calls for using
improved crime-reporting techniques and networking with residents to identify
the most crime-ridden areas. City inspectors and building officials will be sent
into the problem areas to force improvements or demolish dilapidated buildings
that serve as havens for crime. Junk vehicles will be removed. Broken windows
fixed.

Simple arrests of offenders has not brought improvements and does not solve the
problem, Jones said in a press conference at the Police Department. Fire Chief
Larry Taft said property owners would be notified of problems found by the fire
marshal, fire-safety inspectors and code enforcement officials. The owners will
be challenged to make improvements or face tough city actions.

The fact is, were going to see a lot more demolitions of vacant buildings, Taft
said. Public Works Director Stan Lemke said his staff would make neighborhood
improvements to enhance crime-fighting efforts, such as improving lighting.

We might clear a vacant lot to make it more visible so criminals cant hide, he
said. Police Lt. Patrick Myers, who proposed a similar effort several years ago
based on a model in Fort Lauderdale, said he expects the Crime Team to make the
city a safer place. City Manager Jim Chisholm authorized the Crime Team
approach. We have got to get serious about crime, he said. Commissioner Dwayne
Taylor called the crime team a good first step. He is planning an ordinance with
guidelines to fight crime, such as regular reports to monitor progress.

Im very serious about wanting to make this city as much crime- free as we can
possibly make it, Taylor said. Violent Crime Adjusted for population, Daytona
Beachs crime statistics rank it as Floridas second-most violent city with a

FBI reports crime continues decade-long drop

LENGTH: 356 words

Violent crime decreased again last year, marking a decade in which the nation's
streets got safer.

Only a slight increase in murders, particularly those committed with handguns,
marred the FBI's 2003 crime statistics report made public on Monday.

The rate of violent crime has dropped by about a third since the early 1990s,
when urban areas were awash in gang wars and crack cocaine. Despite the uptick
last year, the murder rate is down 37% since 1994.


Police departments nationwide reported that fewer than half of all violent
crimes were solved last year, although 62% of all murders were.

There were 475 violent crimes for every 100,000 Americans, or about 1.4 million
murders, rapes, robberies and aggravated assaults in 2003. Although the number
of murders increased to 16,503 in 2003 from 16,229 in 2002, the murder rate
remained substantially the same: 5.7 murders for every 100,000 Americans in 2003
from 5.6 in 2002.

Property crimes, except car theft, also declined in 2003. Motor vehicle thefts
have been rising slightly since 2001 and are up about 3% since 1999. The FBI
estimates that stolen cars cost victims $8.6 billion in 2003.

"No question that the overall story, in a word, is stability, not change," says
Richard Rosenfeld, professor of criminology at University of Missouri-St. Louis.
"We're seeing very little change from last year and over the last few years. The
conditions that give rise to homicide aren't changing all that much."

Conditions that drive homicide include newly emerging illegal drug use and high
unemployment.

"There is some very strong evidence of a shift in drug abuse away from crack
cocaine," says Sam Walker, professor of criminal justice at University of
Nebraska-Omaha. "People are doing other drugs, but crack had a particularly
devastating effect. It sent violent crime soaring in the 1990s."

In 1991, violent crime and murders hit a two-decade high. The FBI recorded 758
violent crimes, including 9.8 murders, per 100,000 people.

The FBI report is based on crime statistics submitted to the agency by 17,000
police and sheriff's departments.

Lost police reports hint at deeper woes;
Officers say books often cooked to boost image

ATLANTA -- Not accounting for 22,000 crimes can definitely improve a city's
crime rate.

That was the case in Atlanta, where police recently revealed they were missing
that many crime reports from a single year.

While the underreporting shocked many civilians, it was no surprise for those in
law enforcement, who are well aware that agencies across the country lose or
alter crime reports to burnish their widely reported crime statistics.

In New York, a police captain was accused of routinely downgrading crime reports
so he'd look good in the eyes of his superiors. Philadelphia's Sex Crimes Unit
dismissed as non-crimes several thousand reports of rape in 1999. And in
Baltimore, an information technology worker quit in December over claims the
city's crime reporting was wildly inaccurate.

"It's been a chronic problem," said Samuel Walker, a criminal justice professor
at the University of Nebraska at Omaha who runs the Web site
www.policeaccountability.org. "But then again, no one knows exactly how serious
it is. There's no real accounting, no real auditing."

Police and experts say crime rates never are all that accurate, since the job of
crime reporting is mostly left to the police themselves -- and police are under
constant pressure to show crime rates are dropping.

Even the FBI's national crime reports are known to be only vaguely accurate,
since they too rely on reports from police.

"Criminologists have known for years that crime statistics are not reliable,"
said Robert Friedmann, a criminal justice professor at Georgia State University.

The problem, Friedmann said, can be caused by pressure from politicians who want
to put a good face on crime, or by officers who fear for their jobs. The
solution may involve more independent assessments like Atlanta's.

For the most part, the public would only find out if crimes are being downgraded
-- or if incidents are tucked into a dark corner -- when there's a scandal.

The exception is a department such as Atlanta's, which ordered an independent
audit to come clean on its misreporting problem. Only a few other cities --
including Boston and New Orleans -- have done the same.

Atlanta's audit said the city underreported crimes for years to help land the
1996 Olympics and pump up tourism. In 2002 alone, there were more than 22,000
missing police reports, 4,281 of which could have been counted as violent
offenses.

Despite the distorted figures, Atlanta ranked No. 1 or No. 2 in violent crimes
such as rape and murder in nine of the last 10 years, according to FBI crime
data, which is compiled from reports submitted by police departments.

"Soon after coming here, I discovered that the systems and practice of the
Atlanta police department were essentially broken," Chief Richard Pennington
said in the audit.

Pennington has proposed a number of reforms, including accounting for crimes
from the time a 911 call is made.

In Broward County, Fla., which includes Fort Lauderdale, the state attorney's
office is investigating reports that deputies cooked crime statistics so
evaluations of the department would go more smoothly.

"Crimes are reclassified every day. If someone has a broken window, they may
dial 911 and say their house was robbed. It may turn out it was a burglary,
perhaps it was criminal mischief," said sheriff's spokesman Jim Leljedal.

Sometimes, as in Baltimore's case, the crime statistics were simply
miscategorized, said police spokesman Matt Jablow.

"In no case did we find that any allegations of rape were uninvestigated,"
Jablow said. "No one came forward and said, 'No one investigated my rape.' "

So crime reporting often comes down to the integrity and ethics of police
officers.

In New York, 70 sergeants rallied in front of a Queens station house with a
15-foot inflatable rat this month as they demanded the ouster of Capt. Sheldon
Howard, who they say reduces the severity of crimes so his statistics look
better than they are.

"If Howard's numbers are good, he doesn't get called up and he looks like a
star," said Sergeants Benevolent Association President Ed Mullins. "It's a
regular pattern and practice that exists in that precinct."

New York police spokeswoman Chris Filipazzo would not comment because of an
ongoing investigation.

In Atlanta, meanwhile, police believe the audit may have overstated its case.
The accounting of the problem could have been exaggerated because crimes get
repeatedly re-categorized in different computers, said Sgt. John Quigley.

"If there were a lot of reports missing, I would have thought letters to the
editor would have reflected the frustration of the citizenry," he said.

LOS ANGELES -- California's homicide rate rose nearly 11 percent last year, and
other major crimes were also on the rise, the state attorney general said
yesterday.

The state's largest cities and counties reported 1,842 killings in 2002, 179
more than in 2001, according to preliminary figures.

"We must never forget the pain that each of these killings causes for families
and communities," Attorney General Bill Lockyer said in announcing the numbers.

Homicide rates had dropped in many major U.S. cities during the 1990s, a change
attributed partly to the strong economy, a waning of the violent crack cocaine
trade and longer prison sentences. In California, the rate of reported homicides
decreased by 30 percent from 1996 to 2001.

But in the past few years, the trend in major crimes started to reverse as the
state's economy dipped. After its largest one-year drop of 14.9 percent in 1999,
California's major crime rate increased by 1 percent in 2000 and 3.7 percent in
2001.

In 2002, the number of reported major crimes increased 3.8 percent. Homicide,
rape, robbery, burglary and vehicle theft figures all rose, while aggravated
assaults dropped 2.3 percent.

The figures released yesterday were for 78 areas with populations of 100,000 or
more, which account for about 65 percent of the state's crime. The numbers were
not adjusted for increases in population over the year.

A few California cities saw improvement: San Diego's 47 reported homicides
represented a decrease of 6 percent. But Oakland had 108 killings, a 28.6
percent jump. Across the bay, San Francisco's figure was unchanged at 62
homicides.

In Los Angeles, crime was up 1.8 percent overall and there were 653 homicides,
an increase of 11.1 percent. Los Angeles County saw a 25 percent increase, to
135 homicides.

Although nowhere near the totals of the 1980s and early 1990s, Los Angeles's
homicide total was far higher than New York's.

That city saw homicides drop to 580 in 2002, its lowest figure in 39 years.

* DALLAS -- A decorated undercover narcotics officer was fired after being
indicted in connection with a fake drug scheme that landed dozens of innocent
people in jail, police said. The Justice Department announced Friday that Senior
Cpl. Mark Delapaz was indicted on five counts of deprivation of rights under
color of law and one count of making false statements to federal officials.

* LAUGHLIN, Nev. -- Motorcyclists began rolling out of this Colorado River
gambling town, ending a rally marked by heavy police presence and marred by one
fatal crash, but free of the deadly violence that erupted between rival biker
gangs a year ago. Police reported 30 arrests on charges ranging from drunken
driving to indecent exposure, compared with 88 arrests last year.

* PERRIS, Calif. -- Two sprint cars crashed during an auto race, sending one
hurtling into the stands and the other into the track's infield, where
bystanders Paul Bagley, 74, and his wife, Helen, 72, were struck and killed,
authorities said. Fourteen years ago, their son, Jeff, was killed in a similar
race, and they sponsored the Jeff Bagley Classic race, named for him, in
Ventura.

* NEW YORK -- Authorities raided a cockfight and arrested more than 70 people on
animal fighting and other charges, prosecutors said. Nineteen roosters and more
than $ 17,000 were seized in the Saturday night raid in the Bronx.

* GIG HARBOR, Wash. -- Crystal Brame, the wife of Tacoma Police Chief David
Brame, was in critical condition with a gunshot wound to the head after being
shot by her husband, who then killed himself. The incident outside a shopping
center, where the couple had driven in separate cars with their daughter, 8, and
son, 5, occurred a day after abuse allegations in the couple's divorce case were
publicized, authorities said. David Brame had put the children into his car
before returning to his wife's vehicle.

* RENO, Nev. -- A spring storm dumped up to 20 inches of snow in the Sierra
Nevada mountains and left some ski resorts with record April snowfall. Alpine
Meadows just north of Lake Tahoe reported more than 100 inches of snow so far
this month at its base, up from the previous April record of 90 inches set in
1984.

CITY'S CRIME DROP OUTPACES STICKS'

BYLINE: BILL SANDERSON

Country hayseeds wanting refuge from spiraling crime might think about a move to
the Big Apple, new government statistics show.

Crime in New York City is down 5.6 percent through Dec. 17. But in rural areas,
crime jumped 3 percent during the first half of 2000, new FBI data show.

And rates for the scariest crime, murder, jumped 7.1 percent in rural counties
in the first half of 2000, while dropping 3.1 percent in big cities.

From Jan. 1 through Sunday, New York City had 648 murders - six more than the
same period last year, a mere 0.7 percent increase - barely a tenth of the
increase seen in rural areas.

Experts say comparing the spike in rural crime with city crime decreases is a
bit unfair, since rural crime levels have historically been lower than in
cities.

"The lower your crime level, the more likely it is you will see an increase,"
said James A. Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University in Boston.

But the data show New York continues to win its fight against crime. "New York
is doing well in most crime categories," said Thomas Reppetto of the Citizens
Crime Commission.

And New York is much less murderous than other big cities, the federal data
shows.

In the first six months of the year, New York's murder rate rose 3 percent -
compared to spikes of 38 percent in Jacksonville, Fla., 33 percent in Boston,
and 23 percent in Dallas.

"We have probably done better than any major city in reducing crime," Reppetto
said. "It seems impossible now that we had 2,000 murders a year in the early
1990s, but we did. That shows you the accomplishment."

Federal money could help labs keep up with crime

BYLINE: Peter Eisler

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 4A

LENGTH: 558 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON


WASHINGTON -- Momentum is building in Congress to provide federal
aid to crime labs nationwide struggling with staff and equipment
shortages.

Responding to law enforcement groups that say thousands of felons
remain on the streets because labs are too cash-strapped to solve
crimes quickly, the Senate unanimously passed a bill late Monday
that could provide labs with up to $ 1.25 billion over five years.
Supporters now will press their case in the House.


"We cannot effectively fight crime if we keep asking our law
enforcement officials to pursue increasingly sophisticated criminals
with outdated technology," Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, the bill's
sponsor, wrote to colleagues.

Crime lab directors say the nationwide push to put more cops on
the street has yielded more arrests and more evidence to process,
but no more resources for the labs that have to handle that work.

At the crime lab in Spokane, Wash., for example, a 131-case backlog
hangs over scientists trying to analyze evidence for a serial
murder investigation; in Atlanta, where each scientist averages
600 cases a year, nearly two-thirds of the crime lab's staff quit
in the past five years.

Such problems aren't new.

Almost two years ago, USA TODAY published a series of articles
that found evidence that could imprison the guilty and free the
innocent was languishing on storage room shelves at scores of
crime labs around the country.

The stories, based on data obtained from 215 of the nation's 299
state and local crime labs, found that caseloads at the vast majority
of labs were growing more than twice as fast as their staffs,
their budgets, or both.

Some labs had backlogs of thousands of cases.

"It's still the same everywhere -- we're all still doing less
with less," says Carrie Whitcomb, former president of the American
Society of Crime Laboratory Directors.

After USA TODAY's series, lab chiefs joined with national police
groups and governors to lobby for federal funding.

The new crime lab funding is contained in a sweeping measure to
bolster interstate criminal identification systems, such as DNA,
fingerprint and criminal-record programs.

States would have broad discretion to decide how to apply the
bill's $ 1.25 billion in grant money. That flexibility boosts the
bill's political appeal but leaves labs with no guaranteed claim
to any of the money.

States could use the grants to improve their ability to take part
in a national criminal records check program for screening handgun
buyers. This potential use would require spending mainly for computer
systems and administrative functions.

Conversely, states could use the money to buy the DNA testing
machines that labs need to tap national databases on sex crime
suspects.

The bill faces hurdles even if it passes the House because lawmakers
would need to find offsetting cuts. But aides to key House members
say the Senate's support boosts chances for aid to crime labs
this year.

The bill "would be a start," says Jami St. Clair of the Columbus,
Ohio, crime lab. "States haven't made crime labs a priority,
and they still would be able to use this money for other things.
Labs will have to be aggressive in sending the message that they're
an important part of the justice system and they need funds."

Va. Still a Main Source For Guns, U.S. Finds; But State Officials Contend
Figures On Weapons Used in N.Y. Are Off

Peter Finn, Washington Post Staff Writer

SECTION: METRO; Pg. B03

LENGTH: 593 words


Virginia remains the leading source of guns used in crimes in New York City,
despite a 1993 law limiting handgun purchasers to one gun a month, according to
1996 federal figures.

But Virginia officials said those statistics obscure the real progress that the
state has made in reducing Virginia's role as the top source of East Coast crime
guns. They said many of the guns used in New York crimes last year probably were
bought before the law was changed to make gunrunning harder.

The study by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, which was released by
Rep. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Robert G. Torricelli (D-N.J.), did not
track the age of the crime guns by state. But it found that 18.1 percent of guns
used illegally in New York City last year that could be traced came from
Virginia.

That made Virginia the leading supplier of crime guns, followed by Florida,
South Carolina, North Carolina and Georgia, according to the ATF analysis. The
bureau was able to trace 2,053 guns used in Big Apple crimes in 1996, and 372 of
them came from Virginia.

Maryland, which ranked 14th, supplied 34 guns, or 1.7 percent, of all those
traced back to states outside New York. Some 173 crime guns were traced to sales
within New York state.

"Virginia really is for lovers -- gun lovers," Schumer said in a statement.
"These gunrunners have turned Interstate 95 into the firearm freeway."

But Virginia officials insisted that the state is no longer as hospitable as it
once was for those buying and selling guns for illegal purposes.

"The key factor is the street age of the guns involved," said Julie Overy, a
spokeswoman for Gov. George Allen (R).

"The average street age of traced guns is six years, and that predates any
policy change within the commonwealth. Gunrunning is a valid issue, and it's
worth studying to what degree recent policy changes are working. But these
statistics provide an incomplete story."

According to the Virginia State Police, the number of guns traced back to
Virginia from crimes in eight states, including New York, has fallen steadily
since the state limited monthly purchases and stiffened residency requirements
in 1993. In 1991, Virginia furnished 15.1 percent of guns used in crimes in
those eight states, state police said. In 1996, Virginia accounted for only 6.3
percent of crime guns traced from those states.

"There has been an impact on gunrunning, and the number of guns traced back to
Virginia is falling every year," said Capt. R. Lewis Vass, director of records
management for the Virginia State Police.

The number of Virginia guns used in New York City crimes has fallen, too,
although state and federal official disagree about the size of the drop. In
1991, 548 New York City crime guns were traced back to Virginia. Schumer's
office said 372 guns were traced to Virginia last year, but the Virginia State
Police said they knew of only 214 New York guns from the state.

"I'm not sure where they are getting their figures," said Vass, adding that the
police plan to do more research.

A spokesman for Schumer said part of the confusion may stem from traces of guns
in 1996 crimes that were not completed until early this year, and he noted that
Virginia has made progress.

"Virginia has taken some significant steps, and [Schumer] has praised Virginia
for that," said Josh Cohen, a Schumer spokesman.

But Virginia officials were chagrined at the tone of some of the congressman's
remarks.

"What is it they're saying, Virginia is for gun lovers?" Vass said.

laundering cash in what is the first major Chinese organised crime bust in the
southern United States.

The indictments handed down in Atlanta to 26 men, including senior officials of
several tongs - Chinese community associations - has set off alarm bells about
the potential spread of Asian crime to the previously untouched Sun Belt.

While the tongs and the triad gangs have been routinely linked to violent crime
in traditional strongholds such as New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco, the
three-year probe in Atlanta proves, according to officials, that the
organisations have spread their net across the country.

Announcing the indictments yesterday, officials said the operation had been
designed to root out Asian organised crime before it became entrenched.

"We don't want it to become what La Cosa Nostra became in this country. We want
to stop it now," said David Johnson, chief FBI agent in the Georgia capital.

Among those arrested on Sunday was Sui Long-ying, president of the San Gian
Association, which is based in New York but operates in Atlanta.

He was charged with money laundering and operating an illegal gambling den in
the tong's building.

Others arrested included officials or members of the Hung Mung Association, the
Fujianese Fellowship Association and the Hip Sing Tong - the latter of which has
been linked to gang activities in New York's Chinatown.

Arrests were co-ordinated and carried out in several cities outside Atlanta,
including Washington, Boston, Denver and San Francisco.

Atlanta's Asian population has grown faster than in almost any other American
city.

It has risen from 12,500 in 1980 to 52,000 at the time of the last census in
1990.

Suspected drug ring kingpin indicted Bozeman will be tried in Atlanta

By removing the hard drives of personal computers and replacing them with
20-pound packets of cocaine, Erick Bozeman amassed a $ 30 million fortune,
prosecutors say.

Bozeman, indicted in Atlanta Tuesday by a federal grand jury, lived the high
life, residing in a $ 680,000 Leona Valley, Calif., home. He lavished
apartments, commissions and perks on many of his associates.

He was arrested this month by federal agents who had tapped his phone lines,
sifted through his garbage, and used search warrants to get detailed computer
printouts of his drug buys and expenses, FBI Special Agent Bill Lewis testified
last month during a pretrial hearing.

"This is certainly one of the largest drug cases we've had and this is one of
the most sophisticated cases we've prosecuted," U.S. Attorney Kent Alexander
said. "It blurs the line between white-collar crime and drug crimes." Twenty of
Bozeman's associates also were named in the indictment.

Lewis said Bozeman spent at least $ 150,000 a month for travel, freight, legal
fees, restaurants, family support and office equipment that included fax
machines and an elaborate computer network that tracked and documented his drug
deals.

Lewis said agents have uncovered more than a dozen phony corporations Bozeman
had established to launder his drug proceeds and a number of offshore bank
accounts in the Bahamas, the Cayman Islands and Antigua to conceal his wealth.

Bozeman will be tried in Atlanta because the federal investigation began here,
said Janis Gordon, the lead prosecutor in the case. During the spring of 1993,
the Bozeman drug ring earned $ 1.03 million in drug proceeds out of its "Atlanta
office," the 63-page indictment said.

Bozeman, now in custody in Los Angeles, is expected to be soon transferred to
Atlanta, where his case is before new U.S. District Judge Clarence Cooper.

If convicted, Bozeman faces a mandatory life prison sentence, Gordon said.

According to the indictment, Bozeman's drug ring sold cocaine in Atlanta, Los
Angeles, Baltimore, Washington, Memphis, New York, Chicago, Detroit and Jackson,
Miss., and since early 1992, he sold more than 2,000 pounds of cocaine.

Most crimes are local, and so are solutions

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 10A

LENGTH: 451 words


Local and state governments spend six times as much on law enforcement as the
federal government. They spend about twice as much on their court systems. And
they spend more than eight times as much on prisons and jails.

Now ask yourself: Who would you rather have handling local street crime?

Surely not the feds. They don't have the resources. They don't have
accountability. And because they get their marching orders from a distant
Congress, they often lack the relevant local priorities.

Nevertheless, Congress has spent years expanding federal law to cover street
crimes that should remain in state jurisdiction. Among the most notable
examples: a multitude of small-time drug offenses.

More changes are in the hopper. The crime bills being reconciled this week by
House and Senate conferees could create more than 50 new categories of federal
crime, including drive-by shootings, gang membership, domestic violence, and gun
possession by a 13-year-old. One proposal would make it a federal crime to
commit a murder with a gun that had crossed state lines - in effect,
federalizing every firearm homicide in the nation.

This is shameless, thoughtless posing, and it has woeful consequences. In a
series of reports ending today, USA TODAY reporters Laura Frank and Sam Vincent
Meddis document a "crazy quilt" of federal law enforcement that has turned the
promise of equal justice for all into a laughable hypocrisy. In Los Angeles,
overburdened federal prosecutors essentially ignore federal laws against
drug-dealing on school property. But in Tennessee, they will risk a charge of
entrapment to make even the smallest such bust.

Part of the problem is that although lawmakers are eager to talk the anti-crime
talk, they aren't so eager to walk the anti-crime walk. Efforts to create new
federal crimes far outstrip the efforts to pay for enforcement. Result:
Prosecutors don't have nearly enough money or manpower; law enforcement becomes
erratic.

There are plenty of other reasons to oppose excessive federal intervention in
crime. It is haphazard and inconsistent. It results in a wasteful overlap of law
enforcement responsibilities. And it can sabotage conscientious state sentencing
practices - as when a newly federalized state crime is prosecuted as a capital
offense even in states that have rejected that punishment.

In the federal judiciary, meanwhile, prosecutors and courts are obliged to spend
more and more time on small-time hoods and less and less time on core
constitutional and civil rights issues.

The result: A network of local, state and federal law enforcement that is
increasingly inefficient. And who does that hurt? Not the bad guys, but the good
ones.

F.B.I. Crime Survey Drops Philadelphia

BYLINE: AP

SECTION: Section A; Page 16; Column 4; National Desk

LENGTH: 266 words

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 19


The Federal Bureau of Investigation, citing problems with how crime statistics
were measured, is deleting Philadelphia's numbers for the last 18 months from
its national crime surveys.

The F.B.I. decided to discard the statistics after meeting with police
officials, who have promised to submit corrected numbers to the F.B.I.'s Uniform
Crime Reporting program.

It was not clear whether the problems meant crime in the city had been
misstated.

"It was a joint decision," said Harlin McEwan, an F.B.I. specialist in crime
reporting. "Clearly, we aren't going to use numbers that aren't accurate."

Philadelphia police officials expect to give revised numbers to the F.B.I. by
next spring -- in time for the release of national crime figures for 1997, but
too late for next month's release of data from the first half of the year.

The department's flawed counts were noticed in September, after a hearing on
policing methods convened by four state lawmakers.

At that hearing, Mayor Edward G. Rendell presented figures showing that crime
dropped in Philadelphia by 17 percent in the first half of 1997, compared with
the first half of 1996.

Analysis of his numbers showed that police counting methods did not conform to
guidelines. Instead of reporting crimes that actually occurred in a given
period, the police were counting the crimes as they logged them into their
records.

"It's not uncommon," said Marvin Wolfgang, a University of Pennsylvania
sociologist. "It's happened to major cities such as New York. For a whole year,
as I recall, Chicago was eliminated from the U.C.R."

Look at the Cost of White-Collar Crime, Too

SECTION: Section 1;  Page 22;  Column 4;  Editorial Desk

LENGTH: 414 words


To the Editor:

Re "Survey Finds That Crimes Cost $450 Billion a Year" (news article, April 22):

The National Institute of Justice's assessment of the costs of crime, like the
national debate on the subject, conspicuously omits from analysis what may be
the single costliest subdivisions of criminal activity: white-collar and
corporate crime.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation, in its 1995 "Crime in the United States"
report, estimates the combined costs of burglary and robbery to be roughly $4
billion.

By comparison, W. Steve Albrecht, a professor of accountancy at Brigham Young
University, estimates the cost of white-collar fraud to be $200 billion a year.

The justice institute calculates the intangible costs (like the effect on family
and quality of life) of such violent crimes as an estimated 24,000 homicides.
Applying the same standards, what is the annual cost of the 56,000 deaths that
the Labor Department says occur on the job or from occupationally induced
illnesses like black lung disease, often because companies willfully violate or
ignore worker safety laws? Why is no estimate even attempted of the costs of
this category of crimes?

Moreover, what does it cost society when corporations violate pollution laws? A
single company I recently examined, the RSR Corporation, a lead smelter, has
illegally discharged lead into a waterway in Indianapolis, repeatedly violated
air emissions standards at a plant in New York, illegally stored lead in a
lagoon in California and is a responsible party at Superfund sites in two other
cities. RSR has potentially harmed thousands. At what cost?

While politicians of both parties pride themselves on being tough on street
crime, both are soft when it comes to corporate and white-collar crime.

You quote Representative Charles E. Schumer, a Democrat, and Representative Bill
McCollum, a Republican, as saying that the institute's study justifies the
billions spent on prisons and more police officers. By the same logic, the
immense social costs of corporate crime highlight the need for tough enforcement
of pollution and occupational safety laws. Yet the budgets of the Environmental
Protection Agency and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the
Federal agencies in charge of overseeing these matters, are being gutted.

Where is this Congress when it comes to getting tough on corporate crime?

TROOPERS ASSIGNED TO TRENTON CRIME PATROLS

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN, Special to the New York Times

SECTION: Section B; Page 3, Column 1; Metropolitan Desk

LENGTH: 786 words

DATELINE: TRENTON, Feb. 25


Governor Byrne announced today that within the next 10 days state troopers would
begin helping the Trenton Police Department combat violent street crime and
armed robberies of commercial establishments.

The first so-called Metro Task Force, comprised of about 35 troopers, will be
deployed after supervisory personnel from the state and city police units work
out the details of the operation. If the experiment is successful, the Governor
said, it will be tried in other high-crime urban areas.

Col. Grover H. Garrison, the Superintendent of State Police in Louisiana and the
head of the state police division of the International Association of Chiefs of
Police, said he knew of only one other instance in the United States in recent
times in which state police had been deployed to fight urban crime along with
municipal police officers. That was in New Orleans for nine months, from October
1979 to June 1980.

Colonel Garrison said a force of 28 Louisiana state troopers had been sent to
the city to work in plainclothes in two ''high crime'' districts. In some other
cities, such as Miami and Atlanta, he said, state police have relieved the local
police of traffic duties so that they could concentrate on crime.

Mayor Kenneth A. Gibson of Newark has rejected the special urban patrols,
calling them political, but Mayor Arthur Holland of Trenton welcomed the offer,
although he said he would rather have more state aid to add policemen to the
339-member force.

City May Call In Guardian Angels

Mr. Holland also said his administration was planning to talk with the Guardian
Angels about organizing local neighborhood anticrime groups. The Angels, a
volunteer citizens organization that has become embroiled in several disputes
with New York City transit police officers, will be invited into the city only
if a mutually agreeable arrangement can be worked out with the local police
authorities, Mr.  Holland said.

John J. Degnan, the State Attorney General, said several cities, including
Camden, had asked for a Metro Task Force after the Trenton experiment was
completed. There is no definite time limit for the program.

''We don't know what we will find,'' said Col. Clinton L. Pagano, Superintendent
of the State Police. ''We intend to be a highly visible presence in the city to
help allay residents' fears as well as reduce crime, but we can't predict a
specific impact on crime statistics.''

Colonel Pagano said the troopers assigned to the task force had been transferred
from highway patrols and other duties. The city will not be asked to pay for the
group.

Troopers to Work in Uniform

The task force will consist of four squads of seven troopers each and seven
supervisory personnel. They will be deployed in uniform in high-crime areas
after a study of the city's crime statistics. The troopers picked for the
program have undergone special training at the state police academy at Sea Girt
in arrest procedures, emergency management, policing of urban crime, juvenile
justice and hostage situations, Mr. Degnan said.

The troopers will answer only to their own superiors, but the state officers
will be working in concert with city police supervisors and at their direction.

Mayor Gibson said the program had been designed to help Mr. Degnan politically.
Mr. Degnan is expected to resign next month to seek the Democratic nomination
for Governor. Mr. Gibson announced his own candidacy earlier this month.

Program Assailed as Political

Charles M. Zizza, the Newark police chief, accused Mr. Degnan of
''grandstanding'' and said the task force ''was politically motivated.''

Mr. Degnan called Newark ''a city under siege'' and said that if he were an
official there he would welcome assistance in fighting crime - whatever he
thought of the reasons behind it.

He said that he had recently addressed residents of Newark's North Ward and that
''I was nearly lynched because I didn't promise to send in the state police.''
Mr. Degnan said the concept of the special task force had been endorsed by
Newark's business community and the City Police Department's Fraternal Order of
Police.

Although officials say the Governor has the authority to overrule local
opposition, Mr. Byrne said he would not order the state police task force ''into
any area where the citizens don't want us.'' However, in a reference to Newark,
he said, ''There could be a difference between what the citizens want and what
the local officials will accept.''

SBI: State, county crime rate down, city crime up

DURHAM - While the state is seeing a downturn in crime overall, in the city of
Durham, reported crimes have increased, according to the State Bureau of
Investigation's annual crime index report for 2013.

The rate of violent crimes dropped 5.4 percent statewide and property crimes
dropped 7.2 percent. Overall, the SBI reports, crime decreased 7 percent in 2013
compared to 2012.

The city of Durham experienced a 3 percent increase in crime per 100,000 people,
but saw a slight decrease in violent crime. The SBI uses population of a
particular jurisdiction to determine the crime rate.

According to SBI figures, in 2012 Durham reported 11,992 crimes. Breaking it
down, that equates to 1,712 violent crimes and 10,280 property crimes.

In 2013 that number rose to 12,354 crimes - 1,586 violent and 10,768 property.

Three Triangle-area locations - including Durham - were singled out in the
report. Cary saw an increase of 9 percent from 2012 to 2013. Raleigh saw crime
drop 5 percent in the same time period.

Durham City Manager Tom Bonfield said what really needs to be evaluated in the
new SBI report is how Durham stacks up to peer cities like Winston-Salem and
Greensboro. Each of those cities, according to the SBI, saw a decrease in crime.
Winston-Salem saw a 6 percent drop and Greensboro went down by 5 percent.

He also noted that the SBI numbers are dated.

"I think that to me, that is somewhat old news, in the sense that it's 2013
news," Bonfield said. "It's already been reported to the [City] Council."

Bonfield said that while crime was up in 2013, he's more focused on the increase
in crime for 2014.

"It's up significantly more this year, which is more concerning to us," he said.

During the latest report to the City Council in September, Deputy Police Chief
Larry Smith said there was an 11 percent increase in crimes during the first
half of the year.

That includes a 30 percent increase in violent crime and a 50 percent increase
in aggravated assaults. The increase in aggravated assaults can be attributed to
how those crimes are reported. When a house is shot at, every person in that
house is counted as a victim - so you can have one incident, but five victims.

There is some good news, though. Although crime is up for the year, so far in
the third quarter, Bonfield said, it is down slightly.

"It's still up, which is not good news," he said. "It appears that it might be
coming down again."

While the numbers were up overall for the city from 2012 to 2013, Durham County
saw a drop in crime. In 2012 Durham County experienced 5,098.3 crimes per
100,000 people. That comes out to about 666 violent crimes and 4432.3 property
crimes. In 2013 that number decreased to 4,990.9 crimes per 100,000 people, with
599.8 violent crimes and 4,391.2 property crimes.

Over the past decade the report shows that the state's crime rate has dropped
24.4 percent, with violent crime falling 26.3 percent.

Aug. 05--El Paso is ranked the No.1 city in working to prevent crime.

"Considering the city's well-known reputation for having little crime and being
very safe, it makes sense that El Paso was able to ascend to the top ranking on
our list," stated the rankings by MyLife.com.

The list for the "10 Most Vigilant Cities" was released Monday by MyLife.com, a
website that offers online identity services and regularly features city
rankings on a variety of topics.

The rankings looked at the nation's 100 largest cities. The list was compiled
using crime rates per 1,000 residents and the rates for thefts, property crime,
identity theft and consumer fraud complaints.

The 10 Most Vigilant Cities were:

1. El Paso.

2. Fremont, Calif.

3. Fort Wayne, Ind.

4. New York.

5. San Jose, Calif.

6. Chula Vista, Calif.

7. Baton Rouge, La.

8. Gilbert, Ariz.
