Bengals offense skyrockets up rankings after big day vs. Browns

BYLINE: Jay Morrison, Springfield News-Sun, Ohio

SECTION: SPORTS

LENGTH: 225 words


Oct. 24--The Cincinnati Bengals are No. 1.

In total offense. In the AFC.

Sunday's 559-yard performance in the 31-17 victory against the Cleveland Browns
vaulted the Bengals from the No. 5-ranked offense in the AFC to No. 1 heading
into the Monday night game.

The Bengals entered Sunday averaging 364.8 yards per game, but that number rose
to 392.6.

They maintained their No. 1 ranking in passing offense but took a substantial
leap in rush offense, with their 271 yards moving from 15th to sixth.

Regardless of what happens tonight in Denver, the Bengals are likely to hold
their No. 1 ranking in total offense into next week because the Broncos are 16th
and the Texans 13th.

The Cincinnati offense ranks fifth in the NFL, behind Atlanta (441.5), New
Orleans (413.4), Dallas (401.5) and Carolina (394.3).

The Bengals are fourth in pass offense and 10th in rush offense.

Their NFL rankings entering the weekend were 12th in total offense, 24th in rush
offense and sixth in pass offense.

The highest the Bengals have finished in total offense in the Marvin Lewis era
was sixth in 2005.

Since the Andy Dalton-A.J. Green era began, they have ranked 20th in 2011, 22nd
in 2012, 10th in 2013, 15th in 2014 and 15th in 2015.

Wherever Dana Holgorsen has been, either as a co-coordinator, coordinator or
head coach, offense has ruled.

Until now.

Holgorsen's Mountaineers are scuffling, ranking No. 110 nationally in scoring,
No. 72 in total offense and No. 74 in passing offense. His quarterbacks have
thrown four touchdowns and four interceptions. In two games, his offense has
gone without a TD pass. And in last week's 37-0 loss to Maryland, only one pass
was caught by a wide receiver.

What's gone wrong?

What's going on?

Have defenses caught up with Holgorsen? Or have offenses caught up with him?

"A lot of guys are doing the same stuff," Holgorsen said. "Sounds to me like a
lot of guys out there are coaching it a little bit better than I am.

"I think a lot of defenses are used to defending the same offense."

PRO FOOTBALL;
With the Jets, the Hurry-Up Will Just Have to Wait

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY W. SMITH,  Special to The New York Times

SECTION: Section B; Page 14; Column 3; Sports Desk

LENGTH: 807 words

DATELINE: HEMPSTEAD, L.I., Sept. 6


Jets quarterback Boomer Esiason eases into the two-minute offense as comfortably
as he slips into a favorite pair of old sneakers. He seems to flourish in its
hectic pace, which has the same feel as the no-huddle offense that he ran for
years as the quarterback of the Cincinnati Bengals.

Operating from the two-minute offense for the last 16 minutes 34 seconds of the
Jets' 26-20 loss to Denver on Sunday, Esiason completed 22 of 27 passes for 231
yards and two touchdowns and brought the Jets back from a 26-6 deficit. But
there were two other fourth-quarter drives that stumbled inside the Denver 20 or
else he might have been able to complete the comeback.

While Esiason was comfortable and the team was productive in the two-minute
offense, don't expect Coach Bruce Coslet to rush out and install a form of it.
And Esiason said he's not going to lobby Coslet to do it.

Must Be Universal

"I do feel comfortable in that situation," Esiason said. "But there has to be
more than just one guy feeling comfortable with it. If there is just one guy who
doesn't feel comfortable with it, then it's better not to go with it. Really,
though, eventually the coach has to feel comfortable with going with it."

Coslet said he was not philosophically opposed to the hurry-up offense, having
helped Sam Wyche refine it when Coslet was the offensive coordinator in
Cincinnati. But he said it's a matter of having a team familiar enough with it
to run it precisely and that it took a year and a half of teaching and
refinement in Cincinnati before the team made the hurry-up, or Attack Offense, a
staple. Also, Coslet said the Bengals had Pro Bowl players at all the skill
positions and two Pro Bowl offensive linemen. The Jets don't have the same
caliber players.

"The reason I resist going to the no-huddle offense is, I know Boomer can handle
it, it's the players around him that will have a learning challenge in front of
them," Coslet said. "If you work on that, then you've drawn working time away
from the normal stuff. We've hung our hat on what we're going to do.

Not a Jump-Starter

"We're going to be a running team, a play-action passing team, we're going to go
deep occasionally. We believe that the style is right for the players. We're
limited in some areas where we can't do certain things. But we're gifted in some
areas where we're going to feature some things. That's my job as a coach, to get
us in the right plan."

Coslet said he wouldn't use the hurry-up just to jump-start a sluggish offense
or score some quick points. He said he didn't think a form of the two-minute
drill thrown in at random points of the game would work, because teams would
defend it differently when there was no time crunch. Most teams play a prevent
defense -- a soft zone underneath with deep pass protection -- in the late
stages of the game to guard against quick scores.

Coslet said he would not close the door on ever using a no-huddle form of
offense while cautioning against confusing it with the two-minute offense.

The difference is that in the two-minute offense, there are a set number of
plays that are run from the same basic formation and blocking scheme, there is a
time element, and the offensive team is usually trailing. Since the hurry-up
offense is a basic offense, the entire playbook is available. And while plays
may be called at the line of scrimmage, a team can control the pace of the game
by deciding when to snap the football.

For example, in the Bengals' Attack Offense under Wyche, Esiason would line the
team up at the line of scrimmage, call the play and run most of the time off the
play clock before the football was snapped. The advantage to the hurry-up
offense is that it doesn't allow defenses to substitute players in and out of
the game easily because the offense is dictating the pace at which the plays are
run.

While most of the Jets' offensive players liked the idea of a hurry-up scheme as
a way to liven up a sluggish offense, a few thought it would require better
conditioning.

"I thought my lungs were going to burst," said receiver Rob Moore about the last
quarter of Sunday's game. Moore had 9 catches for 140 yards, all in the second
half.

Right now it's not Moore's lungs that Coslet is worrying about with regard to
the no-huddle. He's worried about Moore's head exploding while trying to learn a
new system.

EXTRA POINTS

Although the Jets have had receiver EDDIE BROWN in for a workout, they have no
immediate plans to sign Brown, who was cut last week by the Bengals. The Jets
have only four wide receivers and seem content with that. . . . Tight end JAMES
THORNTON will miss this week's game against Miami with a pulled groin muscle.
That means the Jets will go into the game with only two tight ends, unless they
make a move to acquire another one.

Legal Matters - You can't escape a traffic violations, even in The U.S.

Reciprocal agreements between provinces and states

Receiving a ticket out of province is as detrimental to one's driving record as
it would be in their home province.

There was a time, long ago, when you could literally forget about any offences
received out of your own province, including the United States. Those days are
gone! As of April 1, 1989, Ontario and Quebec have a reciprocal agreement
between the two provinces called the Ontario-Quebec Agreement. Ontario also has
a separate agreement with the other Provinces and Territories called the
Canadian Driver's Licence Compact.

Since then, any highway traffic violations upon conviction, will be forwarded to
the offender's home province. If there are demerit points, they will be adjusted
as per the home province's rules and regulations. (ie. mph converted to km/h,
and demerit points assessed accordingly).

Similarly, these take effect for New York and Michigan. Any offence(s) received
and conviction(s) entered, will result in your home province being notified of
the said conviction and the offence being transferred to the home province's
rules and regulations.

For example, an offence of 20 miles per hour over the posted speed limit, once
transferred to Ontario, would be adjusted to 32 kilometres per hour. This would
then result in four demerit points against your licence from the Ministry of
Transportation Ontario.

These offences will show on your local driving record as out-of-province
offences, and the effect of the offence is set out as per the rules of your home
province.

As of 2001, the Territories and Provinces of Canada took it a step further to
instill penalties to drivers for failure to pay fines. This may result in your
home province suspending your driver's license or withholding your license or
plates upon renewal.

Furthermore:

With regards to any suspensions/judgements rendered from the courts, the
following states and provinces have agreements and may forward the said
information to one another. Subsection 198(1) of the Ontario Highway Traffic Act
extends to and applies to judgments rendered and become final against residents
by any court of competent jurisdiction in the following Provinces and States:

Canada:

Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador,
Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Quebec and Saskatchewan.

United States of America:

Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Idaho, Illinois,
Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota,
Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico,
New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania,
Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, West
Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming and District of Columbia.

Special Agreements:

- New York does assess points for minor violations received in Ontario and
Quebec

- Michigan and Ontario have reciprocal agreements

- Quebec also has reciprocal agreement with California, Maine, Florida,
Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oregon and Pennsylvania.

You must obey the laws, and if convicted fulfill your obligations for payment of
penalties as set out by the courts, or you may face the consequences.

Drive safely.

West Coast toasting;
Offensive scheme is singeing Falcons

BYLINE: KEN SUGIURA

SOURCE: AJC

SECTION: Sports; Pg. 1F

LENGTH: 667 words


Flowery Branch --- Detroit is a funny place to find a West Coast offense, unless
you're talking about the west coast of the Detroit River.

Nevertheless, the Lions will bring their version of the West Coast offense to
the Georgia Dome Sunday, and if the past is any guide, that should be cause for
concern for the Falcons.

It is the third in a row that the Falcons have faced, and the first two have had
their share of success at the Falcons' expense.

Falcons defensive coordinator Wade Phillips doesn't see it that way.

"There's no West Coast offense," he said, a bit derisively. "That's all a myth."

Others might beg to differ. Essentially, its practitioners preach a ball-control
offense based on a well-timed short-range passing game, often using the pass to
replace the run.

"That's what it's based upon," said Lions coach Marty Mornhinweg, a West Coast
offense adherent. "And the timing and the great detail with which it is coached
and played. Every system has that incorporated in it."

Former San Francisco 49ers coach Bill Walsh is generally credited with its
invention (hence the geographic term), although he credits its principles to
what he learned as an assistant to Al Davis in Oakland and Paul Brown in
Cincinnati.

As the Bengals' wide receivers coach, Walsh created a scheme using short, quick
throws to keep control of the ball and churn out first downs. After taking over
as head coach of the 49ers in 1979, Walsh developed it further with the likes of
Joe Montana, Jerry Rice and Roger Craig. The 49ers have nurtured several
assistants in the West Coast offense who have gone on to head coaching jobs,
including Tampa Bay's Jon Gruden and Seatle's Mike Holmgren, whom the Falcons
saw the past two weeks, and Mornhinweg, whom they will face Sunday.

The Buccaneers piled up 421 yards of offense, the Seahawks 464, many of them
gained on quick-hitting passes that had the Falcons chasing receivers through
the secondary.

As each coach has developed the offense to his tastes, it has taken on so many
different looks that it is hard to say that they share too much more than the
same terminology.

"So much of it's dictated by your personnel," Mornhinweg said. "Some West Coasts
that have the great running backs stay pretty simple."

What has given the Falcons trouble is that the passes are thrown so quickly that
they have not been able to rush the quarterback enough to affect him. Often,
Tampa Bay's Brad Johnson and Seattle's Matt Hasselbeck threw the ball after a
quick three-step dropback.

The ideal response to that is to disrupt the receivers, as so much of the
offense depends on timing and each player being in a specific spot at a specific
time.

"We'd like to try to throw their timing off," Falcons safety Keion Carpenter
said. "Any type of way, try to throw a receiver off his route or just try to
mess up the quarterback's vision and his reads."

But injuries and a lack of depth in the Falcons' secondary have limited their
options in that regard. It isn't just West Coast offenses that have moved the
ball against the Falcons. The Pittsburgh Steelers, not a West Coast offense
team, hammered the Falcons for 34 points and 645 yards, the highest total in
Falcons history.

Said Seahawks wide receiver Koren Robinson, "We feel, as a whole, that our
receivers were better than their defensive backs."

The West Coast offense is hardly foolproof, though. In fact, Atlanta this season
has faced six teams which run the offense (playing Tampa Bay and New Orleans
twice), going 4-4 against them.

Another failing example is George Seifert's former reign at Carolina, with the
Panthers last year becoming the first team to lose 15 games in a row in one
season. Any offense is better with Joe Montana at quarterback than Chris Weinke.

Likewise, the talent of the Buccaneers' and Seahawks' offenses is greater than
that of the Lions.

"I don't think we're having trouble with it," Phillips said. "I think we'll do
all right with that."

GRAPHIC: Graphic: WEST COAST OFFENSE COACHING TREE
Taking what he learned under offensive minds Paul Brown, Al Davis and others,
Bill Walsh devised an offense based on short, quick, timed throws. The objective
was to make 25 first downs per game and control the ball with short passes and
selective runs. In the past three decades, the system has spread among NFL and
major college teams. A Web site devoted to the offense --- westcoastoffense.com
--- has mapped how the offense has spread among the coaching fraternity:
Paul Brown
Bill Walsh
Sid Gillman
Al Davis
John Ralston
Marv Levy
Sam Wyche
Bruce Coslet
Ken Anderson
Jim Fassel
Paul Hackett
Mike Holmgren
Dennis Green
George Seifert
Sherman Lewis
Brian Billick
Jeff Fisher
Mike Shanahan
Mike Sherman
Steve Mariucci
Mike Heimerdinger
Ray Rhodes
Mike McCarthy
Jon Gruden
Marty Mornhinweg
Norv Turner
Tyrone Willingham
Bill Callahan
Marc Trestman
Bill Musgrave
Andy Reid
Bill Walsh originated the offense during the 1970s.
Denver's Mike Shanahan won two Super Bowls with it.
Mike Holmgren, an ex-Walsh assistant, taught it to Brett Favre.
Jon Gruden has installed it at Tampa Bay.
Marty Mornhinweg's Lions are next-to-last in NFC total offense.

Legal Matters-Reciprocal agreements between provinces and states

SECTION: SHOPPING; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 540  words


Receiving a ticket out of province is as detrimental to one's driving record as
it would be in their home province.

There was a time, long ago, when you could literally forget about any offences
received out of your own province, including the United States. Those days are
gone! As of April 1, 1989, Ontario and Quebec have a reciprocal agreement
between the two provinces called the Ontario-Quebec Agreement. Ontario also has
a separate agreement with the other Provinces and Territories called the
Canadian Driver's Licence Compact.

Since then, any highway traffic violations upon conviction, will be forwarded to
the offender's home province. If there are demerit points, they will be adjusted
as per the home province's rules and regulations. (ie. mph converted to km/h,
and demerit points assessed accordingly).

Similarly, these take effect for New York and Michigan. Any offence(s) received
and conviction(s) entered, will result in your home province being notified of
the said conviction and the offence being transferred to the home province's
rules and regulations.

For example, an offence of 20 miles per hour over the posted speed limit, once
transferred to Ontario, would be adjusted to 32 kilometres per hour. This would
then result in four demerit points against your licence from the Ministry of
Transportation Ontario.

These offences will show on your local driving record as out-of-province
offences, and the effect of the offence is set out as per the rules of your home
province.

As of 2001, the Territories and Provinces of Canada took it a step further to
instill penalties to drivers for failure to pay fines. This may result in your
home province suspending your driver's license or withholding your license or
plates upon renewal.

Furthermore:

With regards to any suspensions/judgements rendered from the courts, the
following states and provinces have agreements and may forward the said
information to one another. Subsection 198(1) of the Ontario Highway Traffic Act
extends to and applies to judgments rendered and become final against residents
by any court of competent jurisdiction in the following Provinces and States:

Canada:

Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador,
Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Quebec and Saskatchewan.

United States of America:

Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Idaho, Illinois,
Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota,
Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico,
New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania,
Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, West
Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming and District of Columbia.

Special Agreements:

- New York does assess points for minor violations received in Ontario and
Quebec

- Michigan and Ontario have reciprocal agreements

- Quebec also has reciprocal agreement with California, Maine, Florida,
Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oregon and Pennsylvania.

You must obey the laws, and if convicted fulfill your obligations for payment of
penalties as set out by the courts, or you may face the consequences.

Drive safely.

ON PRO FOOTBALL;
Giants' Offense Is a Collection, Not a Unit

BYLINE: By Thomas George

SECTION: Section D; Page 7; Column 2; Sports Desk

LENGTH: 894 words

DATELINE: EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.


After another raw, stumbling, slippery-fingered performance by the Giants
yesterday in a 27-19 loss to the Indianapolis Colts, the onus fell, once again,
where it has throughout the Giants' season: on their offense.

Seconds before halftime, trailing by 7-6, the Giants threw an interception after
reaching the Indianapolis 36-yard line. They opened the second half with an
interception after reaching the Colts' 32. With 4 minutes 47 seconds remaining,
driving to tie the game, the Giants fumbled at the Colts' 29. With 1:21
remaining, again seeking a chance for a tie, they fumbled at the Colts' 18.

Four turnovers in Colts territory. Toss in the seven penalties, the three sacks,
the dropped passes, the blown routes, the blown blocking assignments, the
endlessly bumpy nature of the Giants' offense, and it is easy to see why this is
a 5-4 team that, on offense, looks like a 4-5 team. Or worse.

Jim Fassel, the coach, was asked to explain another poor offensive showing from
his players.

"I don't know," he answered. "You might want to ask them."

So we did.

And the Colts, too.

The veteran linebacker Cornelius Bennett once played with an explosive,
no-huddle offense in Buffalo. Now he is a Colt and enjoys Peyton Manning, Marvin
Harrison, Edgerrin James and the rest of the Colts' fun bunch.

"In Buffalo, it was fun to sit back and watch guys like Jim Kelly and Thurman
Thomas work," Bennett said. "Now, with Peyton and this group, it's like a
basketball game; they go up and down the field. Compared to the Giants, well,
the Giants' offense is a struggling offense. They had to designate a quarterback
and stick with him. They've done that with Kent Graham, and he's capable. I
guess they have to stick with him; you've got to have stability at quarterback."

But what if that quarterback is the wrong quarterback, Bennett was asked.

"That's what you find out when you stick with one," he said. "He can do it or he
can't. We went through minicamp and all the tough work when I got here from the
Atlanta Falcons and at first I didn't know two people in this locker room. Now
we're a football team. We've jelled. The Giants' offense needs to jell."

Desperately.

The Colts and the Giants say that Graham, when he is hot, can burn. But when he
is cold, he simply freezes. This is what most quarterbacks at this level do --
only a precious few are great ones. The others become hesitant and antsy under
pressure. In Graham's case, some of it is his own doing. Plenty is porous
blocking. And more of it is a lack of communication and trust with his
receivers, with his entire offense.

That leads to three reasons the Giants' offense suffers severe breakdowns:
trust, mental toughness and preparation.

Tito Wooten used to play against the Giants' offense every day in practice.
Yesterday at Giants Stadium, he played against them as a Colt.

"I used to sit back and watch the receivers, the backs, the offense practice
against us and say, man, that group has some weapons," Wooten said. "But they
really don't trust each other. You can see it when the quarterback looks to
throw and the receiver isn't breaking or isn't out of his route; Kent isn't
going to let it fly out there because he just doesn't know what the guy is going
to do. It's there with Kent because he sometimes throws a very hard ball and the
receivers aren't sure how hard it will be on that particular time; they are
constantly adjusting to each other.

"They do not have that one, true back on their offense that they can keep
pounding at you to set up the entire offense. So, teams try to limit their
running game, force them to pass -- and just sit and wait for mistakes."

There are too many Giants -- particularly among the offensive linemen and
receivers -- who do not thoroughly know their assignments or who simply do not
perform well under pressure. Some of the Giants said that their receivers too
often are asked to read, react and make adjustments while running routes rather
than simply running and catching the ball. For some, it's too much to handle.
Their playmaking becomes secondary.

The players hear Fassel talk about making changes, penalizing bad play, but thus
far it has rarely happened. Fassel thinks he is playing the best he has.

"But mentally," one Giant said, "some guys just aren't into it. They don't
prepare for the games in the right way and when it comes, they are uncertain of
what to do. And it only happens on a couple of plays for each guy. But you take
a breakdown here, a breakdown there, and this is the kind of game you get. Lost
chances."

The Giants have seven games left to prevent a lost season.

They need game breakers on offense. They need crisp practices on offense that
transform into crisp performances.

They need trust.

They need mental toughness.

I think the Giants should make the no-huddle offense their base offense. Quicken
the pace. Allow the offensive players to play a simple, quick, attacking brand
of football.

Beyond that . . .

"One day that whole unit is going to get tired of playing the way they have,"
Wooten said. "One day the lights are going to click and everything is going to
fall in place. The trust. They are going to jell and it's going to be turnaround
for them and scary for the league. It can happen, you know, and I think it
will."

Couldn't happen too soon.

Could happen too late.

At previous stops, Holgorsen's impact has been felt right away;
New West Virginia coach has engineered offensive turnarounds at Oklahoma St.,
Houston, Texas Tech

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. P4B

LENGTH: 572 words


MORGANTOWN - Compared to the coach whose staff he will join next season and who
he will replace a year later, Dana Holgorsen's resume isn't littered with
innumerable stops along the way.

He has done some traveling, though.

When Bill Stewart arrived at West Virginia in 2000, it was his 14th coaching job
in 27 years.

When Holgorsen arrives as WVU's offensive coordinator in 2011 and Stewart's
successor as head coach in 2012, it will be his seventh college campus in 18
years.

Of his six previous stops, the first three were fairly small time. He coached
quarterbacks, receivers and special teams at Valdosta State (1993-95) in
Georgia, had the same duties at Mississippi College (1996-98) and then was the
quarterbacks and receivers coach at Wingate in 1999.

Since then, though, his star has risen rapidly, beginning when he was hired at
Texas Tech in 2000 by Mike Leach, first as inside receivers coach for five years
and then as co-offensive coordinator in 2005 and offensive coordinator in
2006-07.

During his time in Lubbock, his offenses increased the amount of yardage from
324.8 yards of total offense to 529.6, an increase of more than 200 yards per
game. The Red Raiders were No. 7 nationally prior to Holgorsen becoming
offensive coordinator and raised their yardage total to No. 4 in 2005, his first
season directing the offense.

In his two years as offensive coordinator, his squad was nationally ranked No. 8
in 2006 and No. 3 in 2007. In 2007, Texas Tech led the nation in passing
(470.31), was No. 2 in total offense (529.62) and was No. 7 in scoring offense
(40.9).

Quarterback Graham Harrell led the nation in total offense and Biletnikoff Award
winner Michael Crabtree led the nation in receptions per game and receiving
yards per game.

In 2006, the Red Raiders ranked No. 3 nationally in passing offense and No. 6 in
total offense. Harrell once again was outstanding, finishing No. 3 nationally in
total offense with 344.38 yards per game. Texas Tech led the nation in passing
in 2005, was No. 4 in scoring offense (39.4) and No. 6 in total offense
(495.83). Quarterback Cody Hodges was No. 2 in the nation with 396.08 yards per
game.

After that, Holgorsen spent two years as the offensive coordinator at Houston,
where he apparently first caught the eye of the man who hired him Wednesday, WVU
athletic director Oliver Luck.

In Houston, Holgorsen's offenses accounted for 563 yards of total offense per
game, passing for 433.7 yards per game and totaling more than 42.2 points per
game. His offense ranked No. 3 in total offense in 2008 and No. 1 in 2009.

His quarterback, Case Keenum, led the nation in total offense in 2008 and 2009,
totaling 403.2 yards per game as a sophomore and 416.4 yards his junior season.
He also ranked among the Top 10 nationally in pass efficiency both years.

He was then hired last January at Oklahoma State, where the Cowboys' offense
ranked No. 61 nationally in total offense the year before he arrived.

In one season his group led the nation in total offense, averaging 537.6 yards
per game, was No. 2 in passing offense, averaging 354.7 yards per game, and No.
3 in scoring offense, averaging 44.9 points per game.

Holgorsen is a native of Mt. Pleasant, Iowa, and graduated from Iowa Wesleyan in
1993. He is divorced with three children - McClayne, Logan and Carlyn. During
his year in Stillwater, Holgorsen never bought or even rented a house, but
instead lived in a hotel.

BYLINE: Hays Carlyon

SECTION: Pg. C-5

LENGTH: 496 words


SATURDAY'S GAMES

KANSAS CITY (11-5) AT INDIANAPOLIS (11-5), 4:35 P.M., NBC

Line: Colts by 2 1/2.

Quick look: The Colts defeated Kansas City 23-7 on the road on Dec. 22, forcing
four turnovers without committing one. The Chiefs are 2-5 in their last seven
games after starting the season 9-0.

Last playoff meeting: Colts defeated visiting Chiefs 23-8 on Jan. 6, 2007.

Rankings: Chiefs - total offense (21st), run offense (10th), pass offense
(24th), total defense (24th), run defense (22nd), pass defense (25th). Colts -
total offense (15th), run offense (20th), pass offense (17th), total defense
(20th), run defense (26th), pass defense (13th).

Key matchup: Chiefs RB Jamaal Charles vs. Colts front seven. Charles gained 144
yards and scored against Indy in the first meeting. Charles led the AFC in
rushing (1,287 yards) and led the NFL in touchdowns with 19. He'll have to
thrive to take pressure off QB Alex Smith.

X-Factor: Colts RB Donald Brown. He's made up for the lack of production from
Trent Richardson. Against the Chiefs, Brown gained 110 yards on 12 touches. He
scored on a 33-yard pass from Andrew Luck and ran for a 51-yard touchdown. The
former first-round pick has a career-high eight touchdowns this season.

Prediction: Colts 27, Chiefs 20. Indy won't be plus-4 in turnover margin this
time, but Luck will be the difference down the stretch.

NEW ORLEANS (11-5) AT PHILADELPHIA (10-6), 8:10 P.M., NBC

Line: Eagles by 2 1/2.

Quick look: The Saints have been surprisingly strong on defense this season, but
have lost five of their last six road games. The Eagles are already in playoff
mode, having defeated Dallas 24-22 on the road Sunday night for the NFC East
title in a do-or-die game.

Last playoff meeting: Saints defeated the visiting Eagles 27-24 on Jan. 13,
2007.

Rankings: Saints - total offense (4th), run offense (25th), pass offense (2nd),
total defense (4th), run defense (19th), pass defense (2nd). Eagles - total
offense (2nd), run offense (1st), pass offense (9th), total defense (29th), run
defense (10th), pass defense (last).

Key matchup: Saints TE Jimmy Graham vs. Eagles linebackers and safeties. Graham
is a phenom, catching 86 passes for 1,215 yards and 16 touchdowns this season.
Philadelphia allowed Dallas TE Jason Witten to catch 12 passes for 135 yards
last week. Witten had Kyle Orton throwing him the ball. Graham has Drew Brees on
his side. The Saints have scored 16 points or less in their last three road
games. The key to turning those woes around is Graham.

X-Factor: Eagles QB Nick Foles. He's been brilliant this season since taking
over for the injured Michael Vick. He's the league's top passer in terms of
passer rating at 119.2, throwing 27 touchdowns to two picks. However, this is
his first playoff start and the Saints are excellent defending the pass.

Prediction: Saints 28, Eagles 27. The Saints will hold up just enough
defensively against elite RB LeSean McCoy and company to allow Brees to hit
enough big pass plays for the win.

There is no 'team' in 'O';
Irish struggle to get offense in synch

BYLINE: By TERRANCE HARRIS; Tribune Staff Writer

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. C1; COLLEGE FOOTBALL

LENGTH: 758 words


SOUTH BEND -- Notre Dame coach Tyrone Willingham is the first to acknowledge
that his offense has struggled.

But he draws the line way before suggestion that the Irish's version of the West
Coast offense is broken beyond repair.

"Our guys are trying, they're working hard, they're playing to do the best they
can do," Willingham said. "Our quarterback doesn't want to throw any
incompletions, I don't think our linemen want to miss a block, I don't think
Coach Willingham wants to put them in a bad situation. We're trying to do all
those things."

But the Irish have continued to struggle in many areas this season, which was
obvious during the second half of Saturday's win at Tennessee when they mustered
just 57 yards of total offense. Notre Dame was fortunate at that point to be
facing a third-string quarterback, and the defense provided a little offense
with a touchdown of its own.

In most games this season, the Irish have been prevented from either running or
passing the football. They struggled in all facets in the final two quarters
against the Volunteers.

Most alarming is that this is year three of the West Coast offense at Notre Dame
and many of the pieces seem to be in place, starting with quarterback Brady
Quinn, yet the offense has not seemed to reach a level that is consistent with
growth.

Notre Dame's inconsistencies have left Notre Dame offensive coordinator Bill
Diedrick struggling to put his finger on the problems.

"It's probably defined or explained probably easier than I can explain it right
now," Diedrick said when asked to explain what has kept his offense from
reaching the desired level of consistency. "I'm not going to say.

"It's breakdowns, it's lack of execution at critical times and those things
don't allow you to be consistent and that is most difficult."

Three years ago, Willingham and his staff brought in an offense that was vastly
different from Bob Davie's option attack and force-fed it to the leftover
players. The beginning was a bit rocky, as expected, without the prototype
quarterback.

But even in subsequent seasons as the coaches stock the roster with young
players to fit their offensive system, the results have not necessarily been
there. The Irish seem to either start fast or finish strong offensively with the
27-9 win over Navy last month representing the closest thing to a complete game
this season.

The Irish entered this week ranked 79th in the country in total offense (348.00
yards per game) 90th in rushing offense (121.8 yards per game), 48th in passing
offense (226.2) and 62nd in scoring offense (24.4 points per game).

"It's disappointing and I think it is one thing you always challenge your
group," said Diedrick, whose offense mustered just 216 yards against the Vols
after being held under 100 yards rushing for the third time this season. "For
whatever reason, when they've played extremely well, they've come out and kept
that intensity or consistency in the second half or vice-versa."

Notre Dame receiver Rhema McKnight points to a lack of execution for the
letdowns.

"What it all comes down to is just preparing yourself mentally, knowing your
assignment and not trying to do too much," McKnight said. "That's what it all
comes down to."

Any suggestion that the pieces may not yet all be in place is generally turned
down by the Irish. But athleticism along the offensive line and the deep
receiving threat still seem to be areas Notre Dame will need to improve.

"It's all here, it's just a matter of us going out and putting it together,"
said McKnight, who leads the receiving unit with 35 catches for 501 yards and
two touchdowns this season. "I feel our O-line is making tremendous strides, our
running backs are running well, Brady is doing well and our receivers are doing
well and getting open.

"It's just a matter of us putting it all together. At times, you can see it and
sometimes there are those mental lapses."

And that is where Diedrick says patience is necessary for his young players. The
key is obviously development.

"It's not like the game on Sunday where you can go out and get new players,"
Diedrick said. "You have the players that you have and you try to make them
better and consistent. You do that on a day-in and day-out basis 365 days a
year. Unfortunately, we don't get to work with them on a number of those days."

"You have to be patient with them because you learn through your mistakes.
Sometimes guys have to learn a lot quicker than sometimes they are, but that's
the nature of this profession."

success against both Top 10 opponents this season, yet fallen to the likes of
BYU and Boston College.

UNC officially announces offensive coach hire

CHAPEL HILL - North Carolina made it official Friday, confirming Seth Littrell's
hiring as UNC football assistant head coach for offense and tight ends coach.
The move was originally reported on Monday but awaited approval from school
officials.

Littrell replaces Blake Anderson who left to become head coach at Arkansas
State.

UNC assistants Gunter Brewer (wide receivers) and Chris Kapilovic (offensive
line) were named co-offensive coordinators under Littrell.

Littrell comes to Chapel Hill from Indiana where he guided one of the most
prolific offenses in the country. Indiana finished ninth in the country in total
offense in 2013, averaging 508.5 yards per game. The Hoosiers were 17th in
passing offense (306.7 avg.) and 30th in rushing offense (201.8). Indiana was
one of only three teams to average more than 300 yards passing and 200 yards
rushing.

Prior to his stint at Indiana, Littrell coached three seasons at Arizona, where
as offensive coordinator his 2011 offense ranked third nationally in passing
offense (370.8) and 15th in total offense (465.2).

Chapel Hill sweeps Gibbons for Big Eight titles

CARY - Chapel Hill's girls' swim team eked out a 607-597 win over host Cardinal
Gibbons and the Chapel Hill boys had an easier time, taking down the Crusaders
645-573 as both Tigers' teams won Big Eight 3-A Conference titles at the
league's championship meet at Triangle Aquatic Center Friday night.

The Chapel Hill girls led Gibbons by two points, 535-533, entering the final
event, the 400 free relay, and clinched the title by picking up 40 points for
1st place and 32 for 3rd place in the relay to Cardinal Gibbons' 34 points for
2nd and 30 for 4th.

Top three results and times for each race can be found in Scoreboard, page B2.

Ex-Northern star named to Penn State staff

COLLEGE STATION, Pa. - New Penn State football coach James Franklin has added

All-Atlantic Coast Conference recipient during a standout career at Wake Forest.
A three-year starter at safety, Gattis earned All-ACC honors in 2005-06. He
served as a graduate assistant at UNC Chapel Hill in 2010 and as an assistant at
Western Michigan in 2011.

Gattis participated in the 2007 Senior Bowl and East-West Shrine Game. He was

THE QUARTERBACK IS THE TRUMP CARD OFFENSE >> DEFENSE <

BYLINE: By Jim Thomas ST. LOUIS POST-DISPATCH

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. D1

LENGTH: 1099 words


Does defense really win championships? The Chicago Bears can only hope so.

Lovie Smith's squad enters Super Bowl XLI with a middle-of-the-pack offense but
one of the league's elite defenses. The Bears finished the regular season ranked
fifth in total defense, third in scoring defense, and with a league-high 44
takeaways.

They will need all of that on Super Bowl Sunday because the AFC champion
Indianapolis Colts have one of the most potent offenses in the modern era of the
National Football League. The Colts finished third in the regular season in
total offense, second in passing offense, and tied for second in scoring offense
.

So it's a classic matchup of dominant defense vs. dominant offense. Who wins
such contests?

During the 1990s, offense seemed to rule Super Bowl matchups. ... Dallas, with
its "Triplets" - Troy Aikman, Emmitt Smith and Michael Irvin. ... San Francisco,
with Steve Young and Jerry Rice. ... Green Bay and Brett Favre. ... Denver, with
John Elway and Terrell Davis. ... Closing out the decade with a bang was the
Greatest Show on Turf - Kurt Warner, Marshall Faulk, Isaac Bruce, Torry Holt &
Co.

But so far this decade, the pendulum seems to have swung back to defense.
Baltimore and Tampa Bay won Super Bowls with two of the most dominant defenses
of modern times. Two of New England's three Super Bowl championship squads this
decade were ranked in the top 10 in total defense. Last season, Pittsburgh won
the Lombardi Trophy with a defense that ranked fourth, but an offense that was
tied for 15th.

In 1990, the NFL went to the current 12-team playoff format, with six teams
qualifying per conference. A look at the 16 Super Bowls since then provides
interesting, but somewhat mixed results:

- There have been eight Super Bowl matchups between a top 10 offense and a top
10 defense since 1990. (This does not include three contests where both teams
had a top 10 offense AND a top 10 defense.) In those eight matchups, the team
with the top 10 defense is 7-1. But that seemingly lopsided result is a bit
misleading because four of the seven winners also had a top 10 offense.

In 1992, for example, the Cowboys had the NFL's No. 1 defense in squashing
Buffalo's No. 2 offense by a score of 52-17 in Super Bowl XXVII. But the Cowboys
also had the league's fourth-ranked offense.

One of the best-kept secrets of the Rams' Super Bowl XXXIV championship squad
seven years later was the play of its defense. The Rams finished sixth in total
defense and first in run defense that season.

"That defense was overshadowed by our offense, but they were really good," said
Bears right tackle Fred Miller, a starter on that '99 Rams squad. "Kevin Carter
had a hell of a year."

Carter led the NFL in sacks that season (17) at defensive end; linebacker Mike
Jones scored three defensive touchdowns.

- Defenses that finished the regular season ranked No. 1 are 3-0 in the Super
Bowl since 1990; but offenses that finished No. 1 overall in that span are only
2-3. The Rams won with the top-ranked offense in Super Bowl XXXIV over
Tennessee, but lost two years later with the No. 1 offense to New England in
Super Bowl XXXVI.

The only No. 1 offense vs. No. 1 defense matchup in the Super Bowl since 1990
was a rout for the defense. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers of Simeon Rice, Warren
Sapp, Derrick Brooks and Dexter Jackson crushed the Oakland Raiders of Rich
Gannon, Jerry Rice, Tim Brown and Charlie Garner 48-21 in Super Bowl XXXVII (the
2002 season).

As for this season, the pendulum might be returning to the offense. Of the top
five teams in total offense, all five made the playoffs - including Indy. Of the
top five teams in total defense, only two made the playoffs - one of which is
Chicago.

So is it offense or defense? It could be neither, says Rams vice president of
pro personnel Charley Armey.

"When you get to a game which is that elite, it's mistakes that lose it," Armey
said. "You look at our (Rams) teams, you could say the offense. You look at
(Bill) Belichick's (New England) teams, you could say defense."

But Belichick's 2001 Patriots ranked a mere 24th in total defense. What put them
over the top in their colossal upset of the Rams was turnover differential. The
Rams committed three turnovers in Super Bowl XXXVI; New England had none. How
tough is it to win at minus 3? Over the past four NFL regular seasons, teams
that are minus 3 in turnover differential have a won-loss record of 11-124.

The Bears probably need a game like that to win this Super Bowl. They were plus
4 in differential in their 39-14 NFC Championship game victory over New Orleans
last week.

But beyond turnover differential, or general offensive and defensive prowess,
there's another key factor in the winning and losing of Super Bowls: quarterback
play. So instead of just asking if defense wins championships, the question
should be expanded. Does defense win championships? Or does quarterback play?

"That's the acid test right now," Rams president of football operations Jay
Zygmunt said. "The question you're asking is really the matchup. If you're
saying the quarterback is the key, then it's Indy's game."

If it's defense, then it's Chicago's game.

"Right," Zygmunt said.

Which would Zygmunt rather have in a Super Bowl? The elite defense? Or the elite
quarterback?

"I'm thinking out loud here," Zygmunt said. "But outside of (Trent) Dilfer, I
don't know how many teams have really won without a quarterback's performance."

Since 1990, Dilfer is the only quarterback not in the top 10 in passer rating to
win a Super Bowl. Dilfer had a 76.6 passer rating in the regular season, ranking
him 20th in the NFL, six years ago when Baltimore defeated the New York Giants
in Super Bowl XXXV.

Chicago's Rex Grossman has an even lower rating (73.9), which ranked him 24th in
the league during the 2006 regular season.

In a league where roughly half the games are decided by a touchdown or less, the
quarterback is the one individual most likely to affect the game on a single
play.

Even the old-school Armey didn't pause when asked the elite defense/elite
quarterback question.

"Elite quarterback," Armey said without hesitation. "Because if you're talking
about the elite quarterback, the guy that can make things happen. To me that's
Joe Montana. That's John Elway."

Or Peyton Manning. (As opposed to Grossman.)

"There's no comparison between the quarterbacks," Armey said. "And I think if
you asked Grossman, he'd tell you the same thing. This guy (Manning) is one of
the all-time great quarterbacks. He has established himself, and he's been doing
it a long time now."

Except now he must do it in a Super Bowl.

URBAN SPOTLIGHT;
Notes on cities;
Trust between people, police is necessary

BYLINE: Chet Fuller; URBAN AFFAIRS EDITOR

SECTION: NATIONAL NEWS; Pg. 07A

LENGTH: 525 words


A disturbing trend is under way in Urban America. Police officers in several
major cities - through boorish, illegal and/or immoral behavior - are shooting
themselves and their departments in the foot.

And in the process, they are shooting holes in the delicate fabric of trust that
binds the police and the communities they serve.

Without that trust, all the beefed-up patrols and community policing tactics
dreamed up by crime watchers locally and in Washington are useless. Cities will
lose the ability to protect and serve their residents, which means cities will
decline and, eventually, die.

That is why authorities in Philadelphia, Atlanta and Boston, just to name a few,
have to gain control of their police departments and do what is necessary to
restore public confidence and trust.

The scandal of corruption has recently swept Atlanta and Philadelphia, with
officers in each city either pleading guilty to or being convicted of illegal
acts, ranging from protecting drug dealers to planting false evidence and lying
under oath.

In Philadelphia, more than 100 criminal convictions have been thrown out because
the cases were made by police officers who have pleaded guilty to corruption
charges.

In Atlanta, corruption cases and a controversial police shooting of an unarmed
man have left the department reeling. Morale is said to be low, and public
confidence in the department and its leaders seems to be waning.

In New York City, which has been savoring recent crime statistics indicating
that crime is decreasing in the city, it has been only a year since the police
department was under a nasty cloud because of the drunken, boorish behavior of
several officers during a gathering of law enforcement people in Washington.

In this climate of misconduct and the repercussions it generates, it is
difficult to understand the current, blatant flouting of the law by police
officers in Boston.

As of last week, officers were continuing to defy an edict by Mayor Thomas M.
Menino that they obey the city's parking regulations. According to The Boston
Globe, the city's traffic enforcement officers continued to ignore vehicles
obviously parked in violation of the city's laws, because they had "telltale
signs" that they belonged to police officers.

Those "signs" included Boston Police Patrolmen's Association stickers, caps
bearing the union logo or books of parking tickets stuck under the front
windshield.

Menino had ordered the practice to cease after reports in the Globe that
officers were breaking parking laws with the complicity of meter maids. The
mayor got numerous complaints from residents who demanded to know why police
officers could ignore laws that other citizens must obey.

"They think they're above the law, that's the trouble," one angry resident told
the Globe. "These people are abusing the authority we've given them," he said.
"How do you teach children to obey the law when you have authority figures
blatantly breaking it?"

That question needs to be answered in Atlanta, Philadelphia, New York and other
big cities as well.

College Football Preview;
NATION;
Osborne stands up to Phillips flak

BYLINE: J.C. Clemons; STAFF WRITER

SECTION: SPORTS, Pg. 12G

LENGTH: 809 words


Like it or not, and many don't, Nebraska football coach Tom Osborne is placing
his reputation on the line in support of beleaguered tailback Lawrence Phillips,
who returned to the Cornhuskers this week.

Phillips awaits sentencing after being convicted on charges of misdemeanor
assault on an ex-girlfriend.

"It would have been easy for the university to dismiss him permanently," Osborne
says. "After examining all the factors involved, they simply didn't feel it was
the right thing to do.

"The decision has been made and I'm prepared to live with it. There has been a
lot of pressure from different interest groups. How it will work out, I don't
know. If it doesn't, I'll take the heat. That's part of the deal."

And Osborne is receiving plenty of heat.

"Two months in a counseling program doesn't cut it," says Sarah O'Shea, director
of the Nebraska Domestic Violence-Sexual Assault Coalition. "I want Lawrence
Phillips to stop using violence. If making sure he never plays football at
Nebraska would do that, fine."

Osborne says the junior, who was raised in a California group home after being
abused as a child, is better off in a structured environment, although he won't
play Saturday at No. 7 Colorado (6-1). Minus Phillips, No. 2 Nebraska (7-0)
hasn't missed a beat as Ahman Green has rushed for 724 yards.

"I was worried about Lawrence as a person," Osborne says. "So we tried to do . .
. the best thing for Lawrence Phillips, the victim and other people he will come
into contact with throughout his lifetime."

LOU ON HOT SEAT? Notre Dame (6-2) has more pressing matters than avenging two
straight losses when Boston College (2-5) visits on Saturday. The long-term
future of coach Lou Holtz at South Bend appears less than secure.

New athletics director Mike Wadsworth won't make a commitment to Holtz beyond
1996, when the coach's contract expires.

"But I don't know what's going to happen beyond that," says the former Irish
player. "He will have completed, by that time, 11 years here, and it really will
be determined by what Lou's intentions and plans are."

Holtz, 58, who had neck surgery earlier this season, is in no hurry to leave.
"You don't give it any thought," he says. "Have you thought about how much
longer you'd like to live? It's the same thing. Joe Paterno is 70; Bobby Bowden
is 65. Man, I am a young 58. I mean, really young."

OTHER KEY GAMES: No. 25 Iowa (5-1) - scoring 31.7 points per game against weak
competition - gets another does of reality at No. 4 Ohio State (7-0). . . . In
the Dorothy Bowl, No. 6 Kansas (7-0) can stay on course for the Fiesta Bowl if
it takes care of host No. 14 Kansas State (6-1). . . . Rose Bowl-hungry and No.
8 Northwestern (6-1, 4-0 Big Ten), which has turned 23 takeaways into 98 points,
may need more of the same at Illinois (3-3, 1-2).

AROUND THE CAMPUSES:

This latest Florida State slam comes courtesy of a Sunshine State lad who was
recruited by 'Noles but chose Michigan instead. "Bobby Bowden spoke at our team
banquet," says Wolverines center Rod Payne, a junior from Miami. "But I'd
probably have flunked out had I gone there. They have no academic standards, and
I hear it from my friends who go there."

-Southern Cal (6-1) coach John Robinson, a week after posturing for a national
title shot, faces No. 17 Washington (5-2, 4-0 Pacific 10) with the Pac-10 title
at stake and upset loss to Notre Dame still on his mind. "It makes me think of
some of the Super Bowl losses that teams have had," Robinson says, "where you go
in and try to do your absolute best and everything seems to fall apart. Maybe we
tried too much.

-Northwestern's Darnell Autry picked up 32 rushing yards after the Wildcats
routed Wisconsin. Initially credited with 81 yards, Autry's 32- yard TD pass
reception was changed to a lateral, thus giving him eight straight 100-yard
games and breaking the school record set by Mike Adamle in 1970.

-No. 16 Penn State (5-2) won't be looking back against Indiana (2- 5), which
last season scored 15 points in the final 1:49 of a 35-29 defeat to the Nittany
Lions. Coach Joe Paterno doesn't agree the deceptively close score cost his
unbeaten team the national crown. "I think that's foolish," he says.

-Getting a lift from its defense and light Big East fare, Miami (3- 3) is back
on bowl track with Temple (1-6) up next. "I hope people will come out this
time," says coach Butch Davis, who saw fewer than 20,000 in the Orange Bowl two
weeks ago.

-Three Kansas State players were arrested Tuesday for an alleged assault in
August, a fight that reportedly began over a complaint about noise and ended
with two roommates and their dog injured. The players, backup quarterback Brian
Kavanagh, linebacker Percell Gaskins and defensive end Nyle Wiren, turned
themselves in to police and face a Nov. 1 trial date.

Gators get new boss for offense;
Brent Pease, Boise State's offensive coordinator, will take the same position at
Florida

BYLINE: Hays Carlyon

SECTION: Pg. C-1

LENGTH: 336 words


National signing day is still three weeks away, but Florida coach Will Muschamp
has landed his biggest commitment, according to published reports.

Florida will hire Boise State offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach Brent
Pease to run the Gators' offense, a source told The Associated Press on
condition of anonymity. Alabama had also reportedly had an interest in hiring
Pease to be its offensive coordinator.

An official announcement is expected today.

Pease, 47, replaces Charlie Weis, who left UF on Dec. 8 to take the coaching job
at Kansas. Under Weis' guidance, UF finished the season ranked 105th in total
offense (328.6 yards per game) and 71st in scoring offense (25.4 points a game).

Pease has spent the last six seasons at Boise State under coach Chris Petersen,
serving as receivers coach from 2006-10. He also held the title of assistant
head coach for the last five years.

The Broncos have a 50-3 record over the last four seasons. This past season,
Boise State's offense ranked in the nation's top 10 in total offense (481.3
yards per game) and were fifth in scoring offense (44.2 points per game).

According to the AP report, Pease has agreed to a three-year deal worth a little
more than $500,000, on par with what other play-callers are making in the
Southeastern Conference.

Pease has experience coaching in the SEC. He was Kentucky's offensive
coordinator from 2001-02 before leaving to take the same job with Baylor
(2003-05).

The Broncos fared well against SEC competition this past season, beating Georgia
35-21 in Atlanta on Sept. 3.

Pease, who graduated from Montana, played quarterback in the NFL from 1987-90.
He started three games in his career.

Muschamp interviewed Jacksonville University coach Kerwin Bell for the offensive
coordinator job last month. He also was considering running backs coach Brian
White, who called plays in Florida's win against Ohio State in Gator Bowl. White
earlier indicated that he would stay on staff if passed over for the promotion.

The teams of Super Bowl XXXVIII;
Caroline Panthers...New England Patriots

HOW THEY GOT HERE: Panthers -- NFC South champions; beat Dallas Cowboys 29-10,
wild-card round; beat St. Louis Rams 29-23, 2 OT, divisional round; beat
Philadelphia Eagles 14-3, NFC championship game. Patriots -- AFC East champions;
first-round bye; beat Tennessee Titans 17-14, divisional round; beat
Indianapolis Colts 24-14, AFC championship game.

PANTHERS LEADERS: Offense - Jake Delhomme, 3,219 passing yards and 19 passing
TDs; Stephen Davis, 1,444 rushing yards and 8 rushing TDs; Steve Smith , 88
receptions, 1,110 receiving yards and 7 receiving TDs. Defense -- Rucker, 12
sacks; Deon Grant , Ricky Manning Jr. and Mike Minter, 3 interceptions.

PATRIOTS LEADERS: Offense - Tom Brady, 3,620 passing yards and 23 passing TDs;
Antowain Smith, 642 rushing yards; Mike Cloud, 5 rushing TDs; Deion Branch, 57

STREAKS AND NOTES: Panthers -- Rookie CB Manning, the shortest player for

Donovan McNabb two weeks ago. ... WR Muhammad, who might be most important to
the offense for his run-blocking downfield, has 11 catches for 212 yards and a
TD in the postseason. ... Carolina, winner of six straight, is looking to become
the fifth underdog in seven years to win the Super Bowl. Patriots -- QB Brady
has led the Patriots to victory 14 times when they were losing or tied after the
start of the fourth quarter. ... CB Law, who had three INTs in the NFC title
game, likely will get the task of covering WR Smith. ... New England allowed
14.9 points per game during the regular season -- fewest in the NFL. ... WR
Brown, who had only 40 receptions this season, led New England with six catches
for 89 yards in Super Bowl XXXVI.

LAST MEETING: Jan. 6, 2002; Patriots, 38-6. At Charlotte, N.C., Law had one of
New England's two interception returns for TDs as the Patriots wrapped up the
AFC East title in the season finale for both teams. Carolina suffered its 15th
consecutive loss in what turned out to be George Seifert's last game as coach.

TWO SYSTEMS RUN THROUGH THE MOTIONS;
UW AND N.C. STATE'S OFFENSES DIFFER BUT ARE BASED ON SIMILAR CONCEPTS.

BYLINE: Jason Wilde Wisconsin State Journal

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. C1

LENGTH: 554 words

DATELINE: SYRACUSE, N.Y.


First off, we realize you'll probably be more interested tonight in the location
of the chips-and-salsa bowl than breaking down the guiding principles of the
University of Wisconsin and North Carolina State offenses.

But if you really want to impress your friends while watching the NCAA men's
basketball tournament regional semifinal between the Badgers and Wolfpack,
remember one word:

Patience.

While the hot topic of discussion at the Carrier Dome Thursday was the teams'
respective offensive philosophies, the truth is UW's swing offense and N.C.
State's Princeton offense are more different than they are similar.

Oh, both offenses rely on spacing, movement and reading the opposing defense,
but most good offenses do. In reality, the patient search for the best shot is
the only true common denominator.

"It's not something that's that intricate. It might seem that way, but both
teams are (simply) trying to get the best shot they can," UW coach Bo Ryan said.
"And if it takes eight passes instead of six, then so be it."

Added N.C. State coach Herb Sendek: "(Both offenses use) a lot of the same
concepts I suppose, in respect to spacing and movement. We have some of the same
concepts, but we have very different patterns, if you will, or offenses. So
although our teams may share similar traits, I don't think you can put us under
the (same) umbrella."

Indeed, the Princeton offense, made famous by ex-Princeton coach Pete Carril, is
predicated on movement, is run mostly through the high post and its signature
play -- the backdoor cut for a layup -- results from good spacing and screening.

The swing offense, which is Ryan's invention, is a variation of the flex offense
and relies more on versatility and interchangeability by having five players on
the court that can post up down low and shoot from the outside.

Both offenses have morphed to fit their players, though, and the offenses do
have one other thing in common: Both require, as Sendek called it, "due
diligence" to prepare for defensively. And unlike North Carolina State, which
has only seen the swing offense on tape, UW has some familiarity with the
Princeton offense because the Big Ten Conference's Northwestern runs a version
of it under Bill Carmody.

UW won its only meeting with Northwestern this season, 73-58 Feb.2 at the Kohl
Center, but the Badgers lost their only meeting with the Wildcats last season --
69-51 in Evanston, Ill. In that game, Northwestern shot 51.2 percent from the
floor, including 47.1 percent from beyond the 3-point arc, and were 19-for-21
from the free-throw line.

"I think it's helped a lot from the standpoint that we've seen it before and
it's not brand new to us," UW senior forward Mike Wilkinson said. "But they're
not the same team as Northwestern."

While N.C. State junior forward Ilian Evtimov said he thinks tonight is "going
to come down to who's executing their offense the best," Wilkinson said there's
a simpler predictor.

"I don't know if the most patient team is going to win. I think the team that
makes the most shots is going to win," Wilkinson said.

"We've done a good job so far of being patient and not forcing anything. It just
comes down to, once you get the good shots, who's going to knock down more of
them? So far, we've done a good job of that."

PETRINO WILL GIVE FOES LOT TO THINK ABOUT

BYLINE: Josh Wright Correspondent

SECTION: C; Pg. 5

LENGTH: 687 words

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Idaho


VANDALS FOOTBALL

When Idaho runs the first play from scrimmage of the Paul Petrino era this
evening at North Texas, it could line up in an option-based offense that has its
roots at Carroll College with Petrino's father, Bob Sr.

Or the Vandals might use a one running back spread offense popularized by Dennis
Erickson. Then again, maybe they'll start with a two-back power formation -
something Petrino's brother, Bobby, adopted while coaching under Tom Coughlin in
the NFL and Bruce Snyder at Arizona State.

Petrino could go in any of these, or other, directions in his head-coaching
debut. Which is exactly what he's had in mind since replacing Robb Akey in
December.

"Really what we want to be is multiple," he said. "And we want to make the
defense defend both the run and the pass. A lot of times we're really going to
try to spread them out and throw the ball around, but then in the fourth quarter
you've got to be able to run the football to win.

"That's what it really comes down to."

Petrino's offense is an amalgamation of what he learned in his 22 years as an
assistant coach and offensive coordinator - bits and pieces from Scott Linehan
and Art Valero at Idaho, Jeff Bower at Southern Mississippi and Chris Klenakis
at Arkansas.

These and other coaches - some with ties to the Petrinos, others with no
connection at all - have played a part in the offense the Vandals will unveil
against the Mean Green, a 16-point favorite.

Paul and Bobby, the former Arkansas, Louisville and Atlanta Falcons coach now at
Western Kentucky, used to devote hours to studying NFL offenses and coaches they
didn't know. They would make cut-up game tapes of two or three teams a year,
often return to video of the Indianapolis Colts and New England Patriots to
study both teams' deep play-action pass plays.

"Just be a football junkie," Petrino said, summing up he and his older brother's
approach. "Learn everything you can from anybody you can."

After two-plus decades in the profession and even more years studying his dad's
offense (and running it as Carroll's quarterback), Petrino's playbook is large
and varied and complex.

He and his offensive staff introduced it to players, section by section, this
spring in the first installation of the offense. The players then repeated the
installation by themselves in the summer before digesting the playbook a third
time in the fall.

In addition to blitzing through practices at a frenetic pace - the more
repetition, the better to Petrino - the Vandals also digested a huge amount of
film, some of which goes back years.

"The video that goes with (the installation of the offense) is really important
to us," said offensive coordinator Kris Cinkovich, who coached with Petrino at
Arkansas. "Because it kind of traces back to the offense, and it will take each
play and show it being executed the way it needs to.

"It could be from Arkansas, it could have been a snap at Illinois, it could have
been from Louisville. Some of the snaps are from the Atlanta Falcons."

When they were at Louisville, the Petrinos joked that they should call the
system they had melded together "the Derby offense." Although they coached just
a mile from Churchill Downs and won 41 games in four seasons, the name never
stuck.

That was just fine to Petrino. He cares little how his or other systems are
labeled. The read-option offense, for instance, that's become so popular? He
said it's essentially the same thing as the traditional option offense his dad
ran at Carroll.

"Nobody wants to say they're a true option coach anymore because they're scared
no one will hire them," he said. "It's all it is. I mean, people are doing the
same option that Bill Yeoman and Lou Holtz ran years ago underneath center. Now
they're just doing it in shotgun and now they're a guru, while if they were
still under center, they'd be a boring coach."

The bottom line for Idaho's first-year coach, though, is a catchphrase he
shortens to "FTS."

"We always talk about, 'Feed the studs,'" Petrino said. "And the more of those
we have, the better off we are."

The Touts Favor the Colts; the Statistics Favor the Bears

BYLINE: By MICHAEL DAVID SMITH.

E-mail: keepingscore@nytimes.com

SECTION: Section 8; Column 1; Sports Desk; KEEPING SCORE; Pg. 11

LENGTH: 636 words


If it is true that offense wins games but defense wins championships, Bears
Coach Lovie Smith will hoist the Vince Lombardi Trophy tonight.

This season, Smith's Bears ranked fifth in total defense in the N.F.L., while
the Indianapolis Colts ranked 21st. On offense, Chicago ranked 15th and
Indianapolis third.

That adage about defense winning championships is supported by the results of
past Super Bowls. In 20 of the 40 games, one team had a better defense during
the regular season and the other team had a better offense, as judged by how
many yards the teams gained and allowed during the regular season. The teams
with the better defense won 15 of those 20 Super Bowls.

But Scott Berry, a former statistics professor at Texas A&M who uses statistical
models to analyze football games, says there have been so few Super Bowls that
it is shortsighted to draw any conclusions. Most of the time, he found, when two
good teams play each other, offense wins out.

For an article called ''Does Defense Win Championships?'' in the academic
journal Chance, Berry analyzed 3,316 N.F.L. games from 1993 through 2005.

''When one team has a good offense and the other team has a good defense, the
offensive team has a slight advantage most of the time,'' Berry said. The same
held true in games between average teams.

But a curious thing happened at the top of the league. Berry's article
identified the 10 best offensive and defensive teams in the 13 seasons he
examined. Of the teams ranked among the top offenses, only two won the Super
Bowl, while another two missed the playoffs. Of the top 10 defenses, four won
the Super Bowl, and all 10 made the playoffs.

Although Berry cautioned against drawing conclusions from such a small number of
games, N.F.L. history is full of examples of great offenses that have come to a
screeching halt when facing great defenses in the Super Bowl.

Four of the last six Super Bowls have paired a team with a superior offense
against a team with a superior defense, and in all four, the defenses won: the
Pittsburgh Steelers over the Seattle Seahawks last year; the New England
Patriots over the Carolina Panthers in 2004; the Tampa Bay Buccaneers over the
Oakland Raiders in 2003; and the Baltimore Ravens over the Giants in 2001.

Is this a fluke? Ask Marv Levy and his high-powered Buffalo Bills, who appeared
in four consecutive Super Bowls in the 1990s only to lose all four to opponents
with better defenses.

Even many Super Bowl champions that fans remember as great offensive teams
actually serve as evidence for the importance of defense. San Francisco 49ers
Coach Bill Walsh won three Super Bowls with his famous West Coast offense, but
in all three of those title games, the 49ers actually ranked worse on offense
and better on defense than the opponents they beat in the Super Bowl.

What does this mean for Super Bowl XLI? Berry believes the oddsmakers who
installed the Colts as touchdown favorites are putting too much stock in
Indianapolis. Berry says that his statistical model and the other mathematical
ranking systems he knows of rated the Bears as either equal to or slightly
better than the Colts.

''The betting line has Indianapolis by 7,'' Berry said. ''If you look at any
rating system, this game is a statistical tossup.''

Berry said the greatest lesson any statistician could give is that the winner of
the Super Bowl should not be anointed as a team of destiny. In reality, Berry
said, the teams in this year's Super Bowl and in most Super Bowls are close to
evenly matched. Winning one game does not necessarily make the winning team
superior.

''The commentators will speak about the game as though the winner would have won
every time,'' Berry said. ''But the truth is that they would each win about 50
times if they played 100 Super Bowls.''

Big 12 efficiency rankings: Baylor offense, OU defense cream of the crop

BYLINE: Berry Tramel

SECTION:

LENGTH: 614 words


[img width="" height="" style="" render="w620"]3949958[/img]Time for the weekly
Big 12 efficiency rankings, and the numbers are getting interesting.Remember,
we're measuring an offense's frequency to score. Not yardage. Scoring. And a
defense's frequency to get off the field without allowing points. Points per
possession is the best measure of an offense and defense.What we've learned is
that TCU's offense and OSU's defense aren't quite as good as we thought. That
Texas Tech's offense is better than the already-high opinion we had of the Red
Raiders, and Tech's defense is worse than the already-low opinion we had of the
Red Raiders. OU's defense and Baylor's offense are the cream of the crop.Here
are the rankings:OFFENSIVE EFFICIENCY

Baylor 3.83: Amazing offense even with a third-team quarterback.Texas Tech 3.50:
The Red Raiders with the league's second-best offense, yet are a second-division
Big 12 team.Oklahoma 3.30: Not a good offensive game for the Sooners against TCU
- 18 possessions, 30 points. For comparison sake, Michigan State-Ohio State?
Each team had 10 possessions.Oklahoma State 2.83: OSU had 10 punts against
Baylor. The Spartans and Buckeyes each had 10 possessions. OSU had 10 punts.TCU
2.77: The Frog offense is slipping fast. Can't blame TCU too much, having played
1-3/4 games without Trevone Boykin, but still. Baylor has fared far better with
backup quarterbacks.Iowa State 2.19: The Cyclones have a 6-6 offense. Two
straight games, they scored in the 30s. That's got to be enough for ISU.Kansas
State 2.09: Even Bill Snyder needs a quarterback.West Virginia 2.06: The
Mountaineers are going to have a good year - beat Iowa State and Kansas State,
and WVU is 8-4. But how can Dana Holgorsen have a good year with a bad offense
?Texas 1.74: For your Thanksgiving Night viewing pleasure, you get to watch
Aaron Rodgers or the Longhorn offense. Which will you choose?Kansas 0.81: Kansas
had 17 possessions against West Virginia and did not score. I've never heard
anything like that.

DEFENSIVE EFFICIENCY

Oklahoma 1.43: This time last year, the Sooners ranked sixth in the league in
defensive efficiency.West Virginia 1.97: Good defense is being played in the
Mountains.TCU 2.00: Watch out. The Frogs are getting better and fast on defense.
That makes for an interesting Friday night against Baylor.Texas 2.10: Here's
what's crazy. The Big 12 has two teams that are top-heavy on defense. Yes, Barry
Alvarez, the Big 12.Oklahoma State 2.11: The Cowboys slipped quite a bit, from
second to fifth. That's what happens when you play Baylor. This still isn't a
bad number.Baylor 2.23: This number will go up if Trevone Boykin plays for TCU.
It will go down if he doesn't.Iowa State 2.95: This is not good. Not good at
all. The new coach has to put up a better defense.Texas Tech 3.22: Can anyone
say "lost cause"?Kansas State 3.24: Not a lost cause. But a lost season.Kansas
3.47: Kansas is inching into the neighborhood of K-State defensively. Who saw
that coming?

PROJECTIONSUsing these numbers, we can project scores. Not necessarily
predictions, but ballpark figures on how the games might go.OU at OSU: Sooners
37-29. This seems about the right, the way these teams have played.Baylor at
TCU: Bears 39-34. ESPN will take on a Thanksgiving Friday night.Texas Tech at
Texas: Red Raiders 36-32. No one can envision the Longhorns scoring 32 points.
But then again, it is the Tech defense.Iowa State at West Virginia: Mountaineers
32-28. This seems high-scoring for West Virginia. Then again, the Mountaineers
seem to play this kind of game against everyone but Baylor and Kansas.Kansas
State at Kansas: Wildcats 36-26. This might turn into a game worth watching.

Cignetti, Dorrell talk about coordinator post

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES


A second offensive coordinator candidate has interviewed with UCLA football
coach Karl Dorrell and a third has expressed interest in the position, which
opened when Jim Svoboda was fired this month after just one season in charge of
UCLA's offense.

Frank Cignetti, who last season was the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks
coach at North Carolina, has interviewed for the position. And UCLA assistant
head coach and offensive line coach Jim Colletto, who is the leading candidate
to become the line coach for the Detroit Lions, also has interest in becoming
the Bruins' next coordinator.

The Tar Heels' offense last season was ranked 99th among 119 Division I teams in
scoring offense (18.0 points per game) and 101st in total offense (293 yards per
game). North Carolina went 3-9 and 2-6 in the Atlantic Coast Conference.

But before his one-year stint at North Carolina, Cignetti was the offensive
coordinator at Fresno State for four years and helped guide the Bulldogs to two
top 10 finishes in scoring offense (seventh in 2005 and fifth in 2004). He was
on the Fresno State staff when the Bulldogs beat UCLA in the 2003 Silicon Valley
Classic.

Cignetti was in the NFL before Fresno State, working as the New Orleans Saints'
quarterbacks coach in 2000 and 2001 and as a Kansas City Chiefs' offensive
assistant in 1999.

Colletto spent the past seven seasons in the NFL before returning to his alma
mater as offensive line coach, but has extensive experience as an offensive
coordinator at Purdue (as the Boilermakers' head coach), Notre Dame, Ohio State
and Arizona State.

Dorrell has interviewed Cleve land Browns quarterbacks coach Rip Scherer. Former
UCLA offensive coordinator Tom Cable is considered a potential candidate. Cable
left after the 2005 season to become the Atlanta Falcons' offensive line coach.
He led the Bruins' offense to their two best seasons under Dorrell and his West
Coast offense.

UCLA last season ranked 64th in scoring (23 points per game) and 71st in total
offense (330.1 yards per game). In 2005, under Cable, the Bruins were fifth in
the nation in scoring (39.1 points per game) and 23rd in total offense (431
yards per game).

Offenses running spread give Herd issues

BYLINE: CHUCK McGILL, DAILY MAIL SPORTSWRITER

On the air

East Carolina at Marshall

3:30 p.m. Saturday, CBSSN

HUNTINGTON - Uh oh. Another spread offense.

Saturday is Senior Day for Marshall, and those 15 student-athletes playing their
final college game for the Thundering Herd can help push the team into the
postseason for just the third time in the last eight seasons.

Marshall (5-6, 4-3 Conference USA) is one win from bowl game eligibility. So,
too, is East Carolina (5-6, 4-3).

The C-USA East Division rivals will meet at 3:30 at Edwards Stadium (CBS Sports
Network telecast).

For the Herd to finish with its most wins in seven seasons in C-USA and to punch
a ticket to an extra game in St. Petersburg, Fla., or New Orleans or elsewhere,
it will have to find a way to stop a spread offense.

That hasn't been so easy this season.

"We've had real good success against offense like this and some not-so-good
success against offenses like this," MU defensive coordinator Chris Rippon said.

Marshall, which is trying to win consecutive games for the first time this
season, seemed befuddled when trying to stop offenses like Ohio (559 yards total
offense), Houston (621 yards) and Tulsa (682 yards).

West Virginia, however, was held to 291 total yards of offense in a
rain-shortened game. Southern Mississippi was limited to 384 in an early season
loss at Edwards Stadium.

That WVU game might be key this week.

East Carolina's wunderkind offensive coordinator, Lincoln Riley, is a Mike Leach
disciple. So, too, is Dana Holgorsen, West Virginia's first-year coach.

Riley is just 28 years old and spent seven seasons as an assistant at Texas Tech
before following ECU Coach Ruffin McNeill from Lubbock, Texas, to Greenville,
N.C. in January 2010.

"It's a spread offense and they are in their second year of it," Rippon said.
"They've evolved from where they were last year. The offense is much more about
throwing the football.

"They are similar to what we saw in preparation for West Virginia and the study
of Oklahoma State and Southern Miss. They are not so much like Tulsa and
Houston, who we struggled with. They aren't that kind of offense."

Rippon said the challenge is that East Carolina's offense has the ability to
thwart Marshall's defensive strong point - a defensive line anchored by one of
the top pass rushers in the country, Vinny Curry.

"What frustrates teams is the set, hike, throw," Rippon said. "The defensive
line is all geared up and they see the offensive linemen start to retreat and
they want to go chase it. Before we can even get our hands on the offensive line
the ball is out.

"Now the defensive linemen have to plant, pivot, drive and go chase the ball.
That's when they start to hedge a little bit and they start to get back and all
of a sudden East Carolina starts to run the ball."

East Carolina senior quarterback Dominique Davis is third in Conference USA in
passing yards - his 2,940 yards rank behind Houston's Case Keenum and SMU's J.J.
McDermott but ahead of Southern Miss' Austin Davis and Tulsa's G.J. Kinne.

And then there's the set, hike, throw.

That will tax the Herd's defense because East Carolina uses its pass game as a
variant of the run game. In a two-game span earlier this season, Davis set an
NCAA record by completing 36 consecutive passes.

Don't think those were 40-yard bombs into double coverage.

"I think it's the same story," Marshall Coach Doc Holliday said. "When you're
playing an offense like that he's going to complete some passes. That being
said, you've got to tackle them. When they complete those 5-yard hitches and
those 5-yard stop routes, you've got to get them on the ground and do a great
job tackling them.

"When you put pressure on him you got to make sure you cover up the (hot routes)
and take those things away."

Marshall ranks No. 64 out of 120 nationally in rush defense, No. 96 in pass
defense, No. 89 in total defense and No. 87 in scoring defense.

Of course, that's life in Conference USA, where seven of the league's 12 teams
rank in the bottom 40 nationally in total defense.

"The old adage used to be used to be under yards rushing and under 300 yards
total," Rippon said. "I don't know if you can count yards anymore because they
are going to get them. They are going to spread you out and it's basketball on
grass.

"The question is: Can you not give up the big play? Can you not give up the 15-,
the 20-, the 80-yard play? You have to make them work for it.

"That's when we've had our most success this year, is when we have that kind of
patience."

PRO FOOTBALL;
Knockouts Helping The Colts Flourish

BYLINE: By FRANK LITSKY

SECTION: Section D; Page 3; Column 6; Sports Desk

LENGTH: 665 words

DATELINE: EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J., Nov. 11


For a team that won only three games last season, the Indianapolis Colts have
made themselves felt this year, and not only with their precocious offense. In
their last five games, the Colts have knocked out all five starting
quarterbacks.

The streak began in a loss to the Miami Dolphins; Dan Marino survived the game,
but could not start the next one. Then the Colts, in winning four straight
games, hit so hard that they shortened the day of each starting quarterback: Ray
Lucas of the Jets, Akili Smith of the Cincinnati Bengals, Troy Aikman of the
Dallas Cowboys and Elvis Grbac of the Kansas City Chiefs.

That carnage has not been lost on the Giants (5-3), who oppose the Colts (6-2)
here at 1 p.m. Sunday. The Giants have won three in a row and are tied with the
Washington Redskins for the division lead. But the team's offense has been
unproductive and its line porous, so against the Colts the Giants' quarterback,
Kent Graham, could be more at risk than usual.

"I don't think about it," Graham said after today's two-and-one-half hour
practice in chilly winds. "Every game is tough and you take hits. Hopefully, I
won't take too many. It doesn't surprise me they've knocked out guys. They're
good and they've done it with their front four."

Brian Williams, the Giants' center, said the offensive line was aware of the
Colts' destructiveness. "They're clean," Williams said. "They blitz a lot, but
if they bring blitzes we should have someone open."

The Giants know their offense must be productive to beat the Colts. The Colts
rank first in the National Football League in passing (277.4 yards a game) and
third in total offense (375 yards a game). The Giants rank 22nd in passing
(194.3) and 24th in total offense (279).

The Giants' success has come from its defense. The Colts' success is built
around three young offensive players -- quarterback Peyton Manning, tailback
Edgerrin James and wide receiver Marvin Harrison. As Fassel put it, "They've got
the parts on offense you're looking for."

Still, the Giants' offensive players say they are not bothered by the Colts'
good notices. "I think we just have to take care of business, and things will
take care of themselves," Graham said. "Putting points on the board will take
care of it."

Williams said the Giants were well aware of the Colts' winning streak and the
team's offensive power. "I don't think we have as explosive an offense as they
do, but we have a veteran quarterback who's been in game situations like this,"
he said. "I think our offense has more game experience."

After today's practice, a pleased Fassel said, "Our practices and concentration
this week have been outstanding." He said there would be noticeable changes in
the offense and indicated the Giants would try to pass deep early in the game to
loosen the Colts' defense and help the Giants' running game.

Fassel said LeShon Johnson would start at tailback, with Sean Bennett and Tiki
Barber in reserve. He said the back who performed the best would get most of the
work. He wants a ball-control offense to keep the ball from the Colts' explosive
stars, but can he play ball control without running the ball well?

"Yes," he said, "if you convert third downs. I think we're going to get better
in the running game. I feel like we can run the ball."

The Giants' attitude is summed up by a sign inside the locker-room entrance. It
reads: "A wise man once said: We're in first place. Don't mess it up."

EXTRA POINTS

The Giants placed ROBERT HARRIS, a starting defensive tackle, on injured reserve
Thursday, which means his season is over. He underwent surgery last week on his
right ankle and right fibula. Safety PERCY ELLSWORTH (foot) and cornerback
CONRAD HAMILTON (knee) were ruled out of Sunday's game, joining tailback JOE
MONTGOMERY (foot) and safety SHAUN WILLIAMS (hamstring). BRANDON SANDERS will
start for Ellsworth. Safety LYLE WEST (hamstring), who has been listed as
questionable, was upgraded to probable.

Basketball: Bryant must stand trial on sexual assault charge

Kobe Bryant must stand trial on a charge of sexually assaulting a 19-year-old
resort worker, a judge ruled yesterday in Eagle, Colorado, clearing the way for
a celebrity trial the likes of which hasn't been seen since O.J. Simpson. Judge
Frederick Gannett said prosecutors presented enough evidence Bryant might have
committed the crime June 30. The Los Angeles Lakers guard could face a life
sentence if convicted. His next appearance, in district court, is set for Nov.
10. The defence can appeal Gannett's ruling, but such appeals are rare, legal
experts said.

Basketball: Mavericks acquire Walker from Celtics

The Dallas Mavericks bulked up an already strong offence yesterday, acquiring
all-star forward Antoine Walker from the Boston Celtics in a five-player trade.
The Celtics agreed to take centre Raef LaFrentz and the four years remaining on
a $69 million U.S., five-year contract signed before last season. The Celtics
also get Jiri Welsch and Chris Mills, players the Mavericks got in an offseason
trade that also brought Antawn Jamison from Golden State, and Dallas'
first-round pick in 2004. The Mavericks will get guard Tony Delk from Boston.

Basketball: Webber, Richardson face NBA suspensions

Chris Webber of the Sacramento Kings and Jason Richardson of the Golden State
Warriors probably will be suspended for the start of the NBA season because of
their separate legal cases. Russ Granik, the NBA's deputy commissioner, gave no
further details on possible punishments during a conference call yesterday.
Webber, a six-foot-10 forward, pleaded guilty to charges of lying to a grand
jury about his relationship with a Michigan booster who contended he lent
$616,000 to Webber and three other Wolverines. Richardson was convicted of a
misdemeanour domestic violence charge stemming from an assault on his
ex-girlfriend.

Basketball: Rodman crashes motorcycle

Dennis Rodman was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol after he
crashed a motorcycle while doing stunts outside a Las Vegas strip club, police
said. Rodman, who was treated Sunday for cuts on his legs, was issued a summons
to appear in court for an arraignment in three to five weeks, police said.

Skiing: Maier miffed with drop in ranking

Austria ski star Hermann Maier said he was furious about being kicked out of the
top 15 in the official rankings yesterday. Guenther Hujara, International Skiing
Federation's chief of racing, gave Maier a low ranking for next weekend's season
opener in Soelden, Austria, because of his long injury absence. While Hujara
based his decision on FIS regulations, Maier, who was seeded 27th in the giant
slalom and 21st in the downhill, claimed he felt highly penalized.

Figure Skating: Young takes bronze in men's singles

Pembroke-born Nicholas Young captured the bronze medal in men's singles on the
weekend at the Karl Schafer Memorial figure skating competition in Vienna,
Austria. He was third in the short program and freeskating final. Sabrina
Granata of Embrun, and Michael Fawcett of Newmarket, Ont., placed fifth in ice
dancing in their first international meet.

Curling: Merklinger drops final to Gaudet

Anne Merklinger of Ottawa lost 7-4 to Suzanne Gaudet of Charlottetown last night
in the final of the Southwestern Ontario Women's Charity Cashspiel in London.
The winning rink earned $9,000, while Merklinger's rink took home $5,000. In her
afternoon semifinal, the Merklinger rink of third Darcie Walker, second Denna
Schell and lead Audrey Reddick defeated Christina Cadorin of Orangeville 10 -5.

Thoroughbred Racing: Illness sidelines Azeri from Breeders' Cup

Reigning Horse of the Year Azeri will not run in the Breeders' Cup on Saturday
because of an illness, leaving the World Thoroughbred Championships without one
of its brightest stars. Azeri, who won last year's BC Distaff to clinch horse of
the year honours, became ill after her loss in the Lady's Secret Breeders' Cup
Handicap at Santa Anita on Sept. 28 -- the five-year-old mare's first loss in 12
starts.

Soccer: Misconduct costs Manchester United manager

Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson was given a two-match sideline ban and
fined 10,000 pounds ($22,000 Cdn) yesterday for improper conduct toward match
officials. Ferguson had a lengthy personal hearing with Football Association
officials over two charges of misconduct stemming from his behaviour in United's
game at Newcastle on Aug. 23. If Ferguson decides not to appeal, the ban will
start Saturday.

Baseball: Blue Jays not for sale

The mayor of Mexico City may want to bring the Toronto Blue Jays to his city,
but Jays president Paul Godfrey says that will be difficult since the team is
not for sale. Mayor Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador told reporters yesterday that he
had contacted the commissioner's office for Major League Baseball about the
possibility of bringing a team to Mexico City. Lopez Obrador several times
referred to the Blue Jays -- not to the Montreal Expos, which are openly for
sale. It was not clear if he had confused the two.

Auto Racing: Unser Jr. in serious condition

Two-time Indy 500 winner Al Unser Jr. was hospitalized in serious condition
yesterday after being injured in an all-terrain vehicle accident in Albuquerque,
New Mexico. He was riding the ATV alone in the woods Sunday when he went over an
embankment and broke his pelvis, his father, four-time Indy winner Al Unser Sr.,
said.

Auto Racing: Canadian Grand Prix back on life support

Molson Inc. and race promoter Normand Legault issued a joint statement yesterday
saying they'll work together to try and save the Canadian Grand Prix. Molson and
Legault said they were "reaffirming their determination to work together to keep
the Montreal Grand Prix on the Formula One race calendar." Montreal Canadiens
majority owner George Gillett confirmed Saturday that he and Molson were looking
into either buying or becoming a major shareholder in the race.

Bills' No-Huddle Offense Is No Big Deal, Giants Say

BYLINE: By FRANK LITSKY, Special to The New York Times

SECTION: Section B; Page 9; Column 2; Sports Desk

LENGTH: 760 words

DATELINE: EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J., Dec. 13


From sandlots to the pros, football teams huddle before each play to hear the
quarterback call the play. Now, an offense will sometimes eliminate the huddle
and call the play on the line of scrimmage, hoping to confuse the defense or
keep it from changing players.

This season, the Buffalo Bills have had success running plays without a huddle.
That is hardly the reason the Bills and their well-balanced offense have an 11-2
record and are headed for the National Football League playoffs. But when the
Bills play the Giants at 12:30 P.M. Saturday at Giants Stadium, they seem sure
to use their no-huddle offense sooner or later.

"They're going to use it," Coach Bill Parcells of the Giants said today. "We're
not going to have trouble. Huddle or no huddle, the offense has to play the
defense. Execution is what counts."

Special Preparation

Preparation, too, and the Giants say they will be prepared. Every week, they
work in practice against the two-minute offense, which employs no huddle. This
week, preparing for the Bills, their defense practiced against the no-huddle
offense Wednesday and today.

"It's just one more thing to work on," Parcells said.

In the no-huddle offense, the players line up in a standard formation. The
quarterback looks over the defense and calls the play, his choice depending on
what he sees in the defense.

The idea of the no-huddle is to catch the defense in a mismatch. For example, if
the offense has three wide receivers on the field against a regular defense, it
may go to a no-huddle to keep the defense from sending in an extra defensive
back.

All teams use a two-minute offense, usually in the final minutes of a half or
the game when they try to pass the ball downfield and stop the clock as much as
possible.

Flexible Approach

The Bills' no-huddle offense is more flexible because time is not a factor.
Thus, there are enough running plays available. There are few running plays in a
normal two-minute offense.

Jim Kelly, the Bills' quarterback, has long campaigned for a part-time no-huddle
offense. The Bills have used it effectively, especially in a 30-23 victory over
the Philadelphia Eagles two weekends ago.

The Bills started that game with the no-huddle and completed slant passes. Then
they had three or four possessions where the no-huddle offense did not help.

Parcells said only one no-huddle play gave Philadelphia trouble. He said the
Eagles were trying to blitz and the blitzer could not find the right place to
line up. That play led to a Bills touchdown.

The Cincinnati Bengals have long used the no-huddle apart from their two-minute
offense. The Los Angeles Rams used it in 1988 in beating the Giants, 45-31. The
Houston Oilers and the Jets have used it. Even the Giants have used it.

"In 1985 in Houston," Parcells said, "we got 10 points out of it. We've used it
in five or six different games. You try to unsettle the defense and maybe
standardize their coverages."

"You have to be on your toes more," said Erik Howard, the Giants' nose tackle,
"ready to play every play. You have no time to adjust. You adjust on the run."

"Our hands won't be tied," said Myron Guyton, the free safety. "We can play one
coverage for two or three different offenses."

"I guess a lot of teams aren't prepared for the no-huddle," said Mark Collins,
the cornerback. "They think it won't happen to them. But we'll be ready. Jim
Kelly will be looking at us to see what we're doing, but we'll be looking at
him."

--------
Moore Could Play

Parcells said Eric Moore looked good and had a better chance to play Saturday,
although he said he was unsure how he would use him. Moore started the first
three games of the season at right guard and, after Jumbo Elliott was injured,
the next eight at left tackle. Moore missed Sunday's victory over the Minnesota
Vikings because of a sprained ankle. Parcells has rotated his offensive linemen
in practice, and on Saturday Moore may back up Elliott at tackle and Bob Kratch
at guard. . . . The Giants will hold a regular practice Friday despite a game
the next day. After that practice, Parcells will drive to a New Brunswick
hospital to have a tube removed from a kidney, ending a weeklong kidney-stone
ordeal. Parcells said he expected to leave the hospital quickly and be at the
Giants' hotel Friday night. . . . Lawrence Taylor of the Giants on Bruce Smith
of the Bills, who says he and not Taylor is the best defensive player in pro
football: "It doesn't bother me. It doesn't concern me. Everybody's time
passes."

BUCS TO 'REID' EAGLES' OFFENSE; KNOWING THE WEST COAST OFFENSE WILL BE A PLUS
FOR THE BUCS DEFENSE.

BYLINE: MIKE COBB The Ledger

SECTION: Sports; Pg. C14

LENGTH: 1109 words


PHILADELPHIA -- The last time Philadelphia Coach Andy Reid saw Tampa Bay's
defense, it was hammering his quarterback into the ground, so he knows the Bucs
know how to defend his West Coast offense.

Reid, in his first year as the Eagles' head coach, was Green Bay's quarterbacks
coach last year when the Bucs beat the Packers, 24-22, at Raymond James Stadium
in Tampa.

In that game, the Bucs sacked Packers quarterback Brett Favre eight times and
forced a total of eight fumbles.

Today, at Veterans Stadium, Reid's Eagles will face the Buccaneers at 1 p.m.,
and even though it has been four years since the Bucs and Eagles last met, Reid
knows Tampa Bay will know his offense.

"They've put a lot of time into working against the West Coast offense, and they
do have some experience against it," Reid said. "(Coach Tony Dungy) has been
able to develop this defense that has been effective against it."

Over the past two years, the Bucs are 3-3 against teams that run the West Coast
offense, but they've held opponents below their season average, accumulated 24
sacks and seven fumble recoveries in all six games.

The West Coast offense, originally developed by Bill Walsh with the San
Francisco 49ers, uses a variety of passing routes and is built on the concept of
the quarterback making quick reads and quick throws.

Because of that, the offense doesn't often double-team defensive linemen and
that's a good thing for the Bucs, whose defensive strength is up front.

"There are some advantages for us. We think it plays into our hands because of
the speed on our defense," Dungy said.

Dungy said in looking at tapes of the Eagles, their offense is very similar to
Green Bay's offense of a year ago.

"It's pretty much what we played against the last couple of years so that gives
us a little bit of a benefit because we've gone against it," Dungy said.

The Eagles will be the first of six teams the Bucs will face this year that use
the West Coast, or some variation of it. The other teams include, Green Bay
twice, Denver, Oakland, Seattle and Kansas City.

"There's a lot of carry over from week to week," Dungy said. "You see a lot of
the same routes and the same offense.

"It's not going back and relearning new things on defense. When you get it every
other week or every third week, it kind of helps."

The Bucs' defense is ranked second in the NFL after holding the Giants to 107
yards and four first downs last week.

Of more immediate concern for Dungy is getting his own offense untracked.

The offense turned the ball over five times last week, including three
interceptions by quarterback Trent Dilfer, leading to all 17 New York Giants
points in a 17-13 loss.

Dilfer will again start, but Dungy wouldn't speculate what Dilfer's future
status might be if he has a similar outing.

"I don't want to get into hypotheticals and what-ifs," Dungy said. "We're going
up there to win the game. Hopefully we'll do that."

Likewise, Dilfer said he can't worry about whether he'll lose his job if he
plays poorly again.

"It's a natural reaction to let that creep in, but all that does is hurt you,"
Dilfer said. "I'm preparing to play the best game of

my career."

In Triangle, Cuts Are Sharp And So Is Learning Curve

BYLINE: By JONATHAN ABRAMS

SECTION: Section D; Column 0; Sports Desk; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 1229 words

DATELINE: MINNEAPOLIS


The rookie point guard Jonny Flynn knew little about the triangle offense when
he arrived in the N.B.A., other than that Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant ran it
as a conduit to championship after championship with the Bulls and the Lakers.

Flynn has been cramming ever since. Kurt Rambis, the first-year Timberwolves
coach and a student  of the offense's innovator, Tex Winter, has installed
portions of it in Minnesota. Flynn initially thought of the offense as a
freelance system that would cater to his skills with the ball.

He was wrong. The triangle offense is based on reads and rhythm, spacing and
cutting. The players, beyond the center, are interchangeable. Guards play in the
post, forwards on the wing. The goal is always to take the path of least
resistance -- unless you are a rookie learning it.

''It's the hardest transition in any sport I've ever played,'' Flynn said
recently.

The offense can seem to be mystical and mythical. To some, it is easily
digestible. Others claim it is too lethargic for the fast and frenetic N.B.A.
Despite the triangle's success -- 10 of the last 19 N.B.A. champions showcased
the offense -- few possess the time, trust or diligence to install it.

Their reasons are plentiful, and skeptics are quick to point out that Coach Phil
Jackson captured all 10 of those titles with Michael Jordan or Kobe Bryant  at
his disposal. (For three of them, he had Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal.)

''You've got to spend a lot of time on it, on its reads,'' Denver Nuggets Coach
George Karl said. ''Most coaches are too impatient to sacrifice time teaching at
the defensive end of the court for an offensive system.''

Few beyond Jackson try. Rambis is the latest coach on a short list who have, and
all have links to Jackson. Tim Floyd, who succeeded Jackson in Chicago, and Jim
Cleamons, a longtime Jackson assistant who briefly coached the Dallas Mavericks,
had uninspired results with it.

''It has such a negative aspect to it because people don't understand it,''
Rambis said, adding that few know how to teach the offense correctly. ''They
just assume that you have to have Michael Jordan or Kobe Bryant to make it work,
but that's not true.''

Winter refined the offense created by Sam Barry, the former Southern California
and Iowa coach, who originally called it the triple-post offense.

The triangle, created by the post, wing and corner players, revolves around
seven guiding principles: the ball handler reading the defense;  correct
decisions based on the defense; penetration through a pass into the post;
separation of 15 to 20 feet for all the offensive players; movement through
sharp cuts; interchangeability in positions; and balance for defensive
transition.

The triangle differs from more traditional N.B.A. offenses because it presents
more options for the five players on the court. There are no set plays, just
many possibilities. And when all else fails,  the triangle  summons a player
like Bryant or Jordan to create his own scoring opportunity. Jackson installed
the offense in Chicago with Winter as an assistant to neutralize the Detroit
Pistons' defensive strategy of isolating and physically challenging Jordan.
Rambis served as an assistant under Jackson and alongside Winter in Los Angeles.

At Rambis's job interview with the Timberwolves, David Kahn, the team president,
stipulated  he wanted the team to have an up-tempo mind-set. Rambis agreed, but
he said the players needed an offensive set to flow into should they not score
in transition.

He transferred only certain aspects of the offense to Minnesota. He uses one
guard at the top instead of two, to showcase Flynn. The offense's main payoff,
Rambis said, is that secondary players become involved.

He explained this inside his office at the Target Center as the city experienced
its first snowstorm of the season. Rambis departed the California beaches for
here. If anyone other than Jackson has faith in the system, it is Rambis.

''It really teaches players how to play,'' he said. ''It teaches players how to
move without the basketball, how to read defenses, how to play together.''

In Minnesota, the onus is on Flynn to make the correct reads and passes to start
the offense. The fact that Flynn is a rookie and played in a pick-and-roll
system at Syracuse is not lost on Rambis, or on Flynn.

''It's the toughest position to learn in this league, and then I threw this on
him on top of that,'' Rambis said. ''So, he struggled with it, and there's a
frustration process that goes along with it.''

Flynn is near the top of most statistical categories among rookies. Rambis and
Kahn maintain that Flynn will develop more rapidly by learning additional sets
and styles.

''I'm in the triangle now and it's going to make me a better player learning
this offense and learning how to get mine off of catches-and-shoots and running
the floor and things like that,'' Flynn said, before admitting: ''But I'd rather
be running pick-and-rolls.''

He is learning on a nightly basis. There is still much work to be done and tape
to be studied. ''It's been tough,'' forward Kevin Love said. ''Especially since,
let's face it, we don't have a player like Kobe Bryant on our team.''

It is a learning process. Most nights, Minnesota looks like a 3-21 team with a
rookie point guard as its conductor. The Timberwolves are 27th among the
league's 30 teams in scoring at 92.5 points per game.

''The biggest thing is they don't manipulate the players,'' a Western Conference
scout said. ''One of the things that makes the triangle tough is, pretty much
besides the center, every other piece is interchangeable. The Timberwolves have
it, but it doesn't look as crisp. As you get better talent, the triangle looks
better.''

Still, Rambis's success in Minnesota may eventually be the greatest barometer of
the triangle's staying power.  The Milwaukee Bucks, the Indiana Pacers and the
Nets used portions of the triangle in the recent past, as did Rick Adelman when
he coached the Sacramento Kings. Floyd compiled a 41-190 record in parts of four
seasons with the Bulls and did not install the offense at later coaching stops
with the Hornets or  at Southern Cal.

In Chicago, Jerry Krause, a former Bulls general manager, developed a rift with
Jordan and wanted to prove that the offense worked well without him. He
instructed Floyd to stay with the triangle offense.

''It was encouraged,'' said Floyd, now a Hornets assistant. ''At that time there
was a lot of discussion as to why the Bulls were successful. Was it the
players?''

If one of the triangle's main components is sharing, Cleamons was sabotaged in
Dallas. He went 32-70 in a little more than a season there as his main players
-- Jason Kidd, Jamal Mashburn and Jim Jackson -- bickered.

Even so, Cleamons remains one of the offense's biggest advocates. He says that
Rambis will succeed by putting his own imprint on it. He also says the offense
will survive once Jackson retires.

''The triangle is literally a junior high school offense, so if junior high
players can run the triangle, then,  certainly, young players of this caliber
can run it,'' Cleamons said. ''It's a mind-set. You just have to be open, you
have to be receptive and you have to be willing to realize that you can't
dominate the basketball. If you are good to the offense, the offense will be
good to you.''

TAKING TO THE AIR

Al Borges has coached teams that have flourished playing in the West Coast
offense.

He's also experienced miserable failures running the system.

That's what happens when you've spent the past 20 years implementing the offense
, or variations of it, at eight different colleges.

"If it's done right," Borges said, "it's a lot of fun."

Auburn will find out this season. Borges, in his first year as offensive
coordinator, is installing the West Coast offense at the Southeastern Conference
school. He's the Tigers' fourth offensive coordinator in four years.

For Borges, it's the fourth school he's coached at in five years. He ended a
five-year run as UCLA's offensive coordinator in 2000, spent 2001 at California,
and the last two seasons at Indiana.

Borges has also served as offensive coordinator at Oregon, Boise State, Portland
State and Diablo Valley (Calif.)College, tinkering with the West Coast offense
at every stop.

"It's still fairly new to college football," Borges said. "A lot of people say
they run it, but how many people really run the West Coast offense? A lot of
people over the years have borrowed plays, but to borrow plays is not running
the offense.

"I saw one magazine article â[#x20ac]¦ that said if you throw the ball to a
back, you're running the West Coast offense."

Ask Boise State offense coordinator Chris Petersen about the West Coast offense
and he chuckles.

"I'm not even really sure what a West Coast offense is," said Petersen, in his
fourth season with the Broncos.

Boise State, though, is among the college teams that have been tagged with the
West Coast label.

Petersen admits the West Coast offense has certainly influenced his offense,
which features some of the West Coast's concepts and principles. The Broncos
implement short, easy-completion throws, with some shallow crosses. And then ...

"We want to change the game with explosive, down-the-field throws," Petersen
said.

Last year marked the second straight season Boise State led the country in
scoring. The Broncos averaged 43 points per game, while also ranking in the top
seven in three other offensive categories.

Petersen said he's seen more and more teams develop some sort of West Coast
attack.

"There's more and more of it, because of high school programs,"he said. "They're
throwing a lot, so there are more accurate throwers."

Former Stanford coach TyWillingham arrived at Notre Dame prior to the 2002
season and introduced the West Coast offense.

Well, at least that's what everyone's been calling it.

"I'll call it a passing-style offense because I think the use of the term West
Coast offense is a little inaccurate," Willingham said. "Ithink it's catchy. I
think it sounds good. But there are so many principles of other offenses that
have been applied to the West Coast offense now that it's not the true, original
version of the offense."

At Auburn, they're calling it the Gulf Coast offense. At Indiana, it was the
Midwest Coast offense.

"It's been tweaked so many ways," Borges said. "The evolution of this offense
has taken a million twists and turns."

One came when quarterback Joe Montana was traded to the Kansas City Chiefs in
the 1990s. Instead of using split backs, a feature of the original West Coast
offense, the Chiefs kept their power running game and added the West Coast
passing attack. Many teams have followed that lead.

"There are a lot of misconceptions (about the West Coast offense), and one of
them is that it's pass-happy," Borges said. "What makes the offense go is the
multiplicity of the offense."

Borges, 48, coached the wishbone as a high school assistant in the 1970s. Not
until he heard of some guy named Bill Walsh did Borges begin studying what then
was referred to as the 49er offense.

"It became a gold mine for me," he said. "It tailored my entire career."

Borges' biggest success story, without question, occurred at UCLA - both
teamwise and individually. The Bruins won 20 straight games from 1997-98, and
quarterback Cade McNown put up Heisman Trophy-worthy numbers.

In 1998, McNown, an All-American and Heisman finalist, set a school record
(which still stands) for total offense, amassing 3,652 yards. His 3,470 passing
yards that season also remain a single-season school record.

McNown, who was last in the Pac-10 in 1997 in passing efficiency, led the nation
in that category his senior season.

"To come that far, that fast, is a testament to the kid's work ethic and
understanding," Borges said. "You just don't see a kid make that drastic of
improvement."

Then, there was Indiana.

Yes, Indiana, which had been running an option-based offense with quarterback
Antwaan Randle El prior to Borges' arrival.

Borges found a fifth-year senior who'd come to Indiana to play baseball. He'd
spent his football career as the team's holder on kicks, but Borges noticed he
had a pretty good arm, too.

He was Gibran Hamdan, and after one year running Borges' offense with the
Hoosiers, he was drafted by Steve Spurrier's Washington NFLteam.

"He could throw the ball, he really could," Borges said. "He's one of those kids
you wish he had another year."

He didn't, though, and Indiana went from bad (3-9 in 2002) to worse (2-10 in
2003). The Hoosiers, with former Notre Dame quarterback Matt LoVecchio at the
helm, finished No. 98 nationally last year in total offense.

Borges said it's the first time he's ever had a team get worse from the first
season to the second.

"We weren't throwing the ball with the efficiency. We were just not talented
enough at that time," Borges said. "What happened is, we ended up being
conservative."

Now, Borges has taken his act to Auburn, where he's running about 75 to 80
percent of the West Coast offense. The rest is bits and pieces from other
offenses to accommodate Auburn's personnel.

"Our kids have done a really nice job with it," Borges said, "but we've got some
really talented players."

Like senior running back Carnell "Cadillac"Williams, who rushed for 1,307 yards
and 17 touchdowns last season. He's a slasher.

Or senior Ronnie Brown, who  ran for 446 yards last season and has 1,794 in his
career. He's a power-type runner.

"I don't think there's an offense that doesn't fit them," Borges said.

There's also senior quarterback Jason Campbell, who completed 61 percent of his
passes for 2,267 yards last season. And Borges said he's been pleasantly
surprised with his group of wide receivers.

Watch the Tigers this year, and you'll likely see a combination of the Denver
Broncos' and Tampa Bay Buccaneers' offenses - the Broncos' wide and tight zones,
and the Bucs' bunch packages, or series of short, condensed routes.

"It's not so much the schemes as it is the way the offense is taught,"Borges
said. "It's the precision and the timing and all the little nuances in the
offense."

Borges knows Nebraska coach Bill Callahan, who's also in his first year
implementing the West Coast offense. He said Callahan's "a great hire," but
preaches patience to Nebraska fans.

"Nebraska doesn't want to be patient, but that offense doesn't happen
overnight," Borges said.

"Once they start seeing he's throwing the ball, he's going to get some dynamic
recruits. You can recruit anyone to this offense. It's a dream to recruit to
because all the kids want to play in the NFL, and it's an NFL offense."

Evolution of a revolution

Bill Walsh (left) won four Super Bowls with the San Francisco 49ers in the
1980s, and his West Coast offense became all the rage in the NFL. Walsh hasn't
coached in the NFL for more than a decade, but his progeny have virtually taken
over the game. Here's are some of Walsh's famous descendants who have become
head coaches:

Spread offense teams often deficient on 'D';
Theories vary to explain correlation

Sonny Dykes has a polarizing problem.

As the football coach at Louisiana Tech, Dykes has built the best offense in the
country, ranked first out of 120 major-college teams in yards per game. But he
also oversees the nation's worst defense -- 120th out of 120.

"It's kind of a weird correlation that sometimes happens," said Dykes, whose
team is 9-2.

It has become a tradition of sorts for coaches like him. Opinions vary as to
why, but many of the most ballyhooed masterminds of offense seem to have an
inverse relationship with their defense. For them, the biggest obstacle to
success is not the opponent's defense -- it's their own.

And not just this season. When coach John Jenkins employed the run-and-shoot
offense at Houston in 1990, his team finished No. 1 nationally in offense but
103rd out of 106 major-college teams on defense. In 1998, Louisville cranked up
its passing attack under offensive coordinator Bobby Petrino to finish No. 1 in
total offense. On defense, the Cardinals ranked 110th out of 112.

This season, four teams that spread the field rank in the top nine in total
offense while ranking 114th or worse in total defense -- Louisiana Tech, Baylor
(5-5), Arizona (7-4) and West Virginia (5-5).

But why? Coaches offer theories ranging from cultural issues to practice habits
-- to doubt that any reasonable correlation exists.

"I'm not saying it doesn't exist," Mike Leach, another spread offense guru and
coach at Washington State, told USA TODAY Sports. "I don't think it's the result
of the offense."

Yet Leach's teams have fallen victim to it, too, with the most pronounced
example coming in 2003, when Texas Tech finished No. 1 in offense and 106th out
of 117 teams in defense.

Leach has considered at least one possibility -- that defenses might get lazy if
they know their offense is capable of scoring lots of points: "I've wondered
that at times, and I certainly hope that's not true."

For every defensive coach who sees it one way, an offensive coach thinks just
the opposite.

Preparation theory

San Diego State coach Rocky Long is a defensive specialist. To him, it's about
preparation. If a defense is constantly going up against a spread offense in
practice, Long says it won't be equipped to face more conventional offenses in
games -- especially opponents that run more of a power running game.

Defending the spread requires good open-field tackling. Defending a power run
attack requires the ability to fight off blockers.

"It's a completely different mentality," Long said. "If you're going against a
spread offense every day in practice, you don't get to work on the techniques of
taking on blockers. You get the wrong leverage and give up big plays (in
games)."

Dykes doesn't agree.

"If you polled 100 offensive coaches about that, not one would agree," he says.
"But you could ask 100 defensive coaches about that, and almost all of them
would agree."

And it doesn't explain why defenses that face spread teams in practice still
have trouble with other spread teams in games.

When West Virginia played Baylor on Sept. 29, the Mountaineers won. But defense
lost -- the final score was 70-63.

'Shootout' theory

Many spread teams play without a huddle and use little time to score. That can
force their defense to be on the field for more plays, wearing them down.

West Virginia, Louisiana Tech, Arizona and Baylor rank 88th, 98th, 105th and
119th, respectively, in time of possession. On average, their defenses are on
the field about two to five minutes longer than their offense.

"When you go up-tempo (on offense), your defense is going to have to play more
plays," Dykes said. "That's just the way it is."

Leach doesn't agree that it's all the fault of a spread offense. If the spread
team's defense forced the other team's offense to punt right away, the spread
team's offense would come right back on the field.

"If the defense wants to get off the field, stop 'em," Leach says of opposing
offenses. "Offenses don't need rest? Only defenses do? That's just lunacy, but
somehow that idea caught on."

Another factor is that spread teams can quickly build leads, which forces the
other team's offense to take more risks and throw the ball to rally. Lots of
points and yards can pile up.

"You see a more aggressive approach from other teams' offenses as a result,"
Dykes said.

Culture theory

Many offensive-minded head coaches are strategists who tend to bury their noses
in playbooks and game film. They moved up the career ladder because of their X's
and O's on offense -- not because they know much about the toughness required to
build an aggressive defense.

This can create a culture in which scoring points and finesse define the team
more than smacking the other team in the mouth. Leach calls this "defensive
propaganda."

Still, many offensive-guru head coaches leave all defensive coaching duties to
their assistant coaches. Some of those coaches have mixed feelings about the
spread, according to a recent survey of nearly 200 defensive coaches by X&O
Labs, a football research company for coaches. The respondents were allowed to
answer the survey without being identified and mostly came from the high school
ranks.

Some said it helped their defense to go against a spread offense in practice
because it helps them prepare for other spread offenses in games. Others said
that being a defense on a spread team is a disadvantage.

Personnel theory

Some offensive-minded head coaches also favor offense in recruiting players. In
his first recruiting class at Michigan in February 2008, Rich Rodriguez signed
24 players -- 15 on offense. He later recruited more heavily on defense but was
fired after the 2010 season, when his team ranked eighth in the country in total
offense but 110th in defense.

This year, Rodriguez's Arizona team ranks eighth in offense, 114th in defense.

But having a good spread offense and a good defense on the same team is not
mutually exclusive. Two top spread teams -- Oregon (10-1) and Texas A&M (9-2) --
rank in the top five in total offense and bottom 25 in time of possession. Their
defenses rank 47th and 49th, respectively -- not great but not terrible.

Some coaches believe that defenses need premium athletic talent more than
offenses.

"The more coaches you talk to these days, good defenses are about having good
personnel," Dykes said. "You don't necessarily need the best personnel to have a
good offense."

Louisiana Tech's offense is full of players not recruited by other Division I
teams, but it succeeds because of the system and the scheme, not speed and
brawn. On defense, speed and brawn are more necessary for success.

Two weeks ago, defenses weren't a factor when Louisiana Tech beat Texas State
62-55. Tech gave up a touchdown with 1:07 left but won by hanging on to the ball
long enough to run out the clock -- keeping its defense on the sideline.

SATURDAY'S PLAYOFF PREVIEWS

BYLINE: Hays Carlyon

SECTION: Pg. C-4

LENGTH: 555 words


NEW ORLEANS (12-5) AT SEATTLE (13-3) 4:35 P.M., FOX

Line: Seahawks by 8.

Quick look: The Saints survived a road game at Philadelphia last week, winning
26-24 on a Shayne Graham field goal on the final play. Seattle routed New
Orleans 34-7 on Dec. 2. The Seahawks, winners of 15 of their last 16 home games,
held the Saints to 188 yards.

Last playoff meeting: Seattle upset the visiting Saints 41-36 on Jan. 8, 2011.
Seahawks RB Marshawn Lynch ran for 131 yards, including a sensational 67-yard
touchdown in which he broke several tackles.

Rankings: Saints - total offense (fourth), run offense (25th), pass offense
(second), total defense (fourth), run defense (19th), pass defense (second).
Seahawks - total offense (17th), run offense (fourth), pass offense (26th),
total defense (first), run defense (seventh), pass defense (first).

Key matchup: Seattle DEs Michael Bennett and Cliff Avril vs. Saints OTs Terron
Armstead and Zach Strief. Bennett returned a fumble for a touchdown in the first
meeting, and Avril, a former Clay High standout, had a sack. The Seahawks have
three Pro-Bowl defensive backs, so if Saints QB Drew Brees doesn't get time to
pass, the offense has little chance to succeed.

X-Factor: Seattle WR Percy Harvin. The former Florida standout has played 20
snaps all season recovering from offseason hip surgery. His only game was Nov.
17, but he's expected to play with no limitations vs. the Saints. Harvin makes
Seattle's offense far more dangerous, and he's one of the best kick returners in
the league.

Prediction: Seahawks 30, Saints 14. Lynch will pace Seattle's steady offense,
and Brees will get shut down again in hostile and rainy conditions.

INDIANAPOLIS (12-5) AT NEW ENGLAND (12-4) 8:15 P.M., CBS

Line: Patriots by 7.

Quick look: The Colts rallied from a 38-10 second-half deficit at home to defeat
Kansas City 45-44 in the second-largest comeback in playoff history. New England
routed Indianapolis 59-24 last season. Patriots QB Tom Brady threw for 331 yards
in that game, but three receivers who accounted for 262 yards that day (Rob
Gronkowski, Wes Welker and Brandon Lloyd) won't be playing.

Last playoff meeting: The Colts edged visiting New England 38-34 in the AFC
title game on Jan. 21, 2007.

Rankings: Colts - total offense (15th), run offense (20th), pass offense (17th),
total defense (20th), run defense (26th), pass defense (13th). Patriots - total
offense (seventh), run offense (ninth), pass offense (10th), total defense
(26th), run defense (30th), pass defense (18th).

Key matchup: Patriots CB Aqib Talib vs. Colts WR T.Y. Hilton. Talib is a
Pro-Bowl cornerback playing at an elite level. He picked off Colts QB Andrew
Luck and returned it 59 yards for a score in the last meeting. Hilton caught 13
passes for 224 yards and two touchdowns last week. Over his last two games,
Hilton has 24 receptions for 379 yards.

X-Factor: Patriots RB Shane Vereen. With Gronkowski out for the season, Vereen
has become the trickiest matchup for opposing defenses. New England will line
Vereen up at receiver and move him all around the field. The Colts have to
locate Vereen and tackle him in space.

Prediction: Colts 34, Patriots 31. Luck's brilliance late will deny
injury-ravaged New England a third consecutive AFC title game berth and mark the
passing of the torch to the game's next great quarterback.

QB 'COMFORTABLE' WITH OFFENSE

SHOOTER CHARLEY WALTERS

The Vikings begin a weekend minicamp Friday, but quarterback Brad Johnson has
been in town working with new coach Brad Childress' offense for three weeks.

"I'm very comfortable with the offense," Johnson said. "I ran a version of it in
Tampa."

With the Tampa Bay Buccaneers from 2001-03, Johnson set a team record by passing
for more than 3,000 yards in each season, and in 2002 he led the Bucs to the
Super Bowl XXXVII championship.

"This is my fifth system in 14 years, and the differences pretty much are just
terminology," Johnson said.

Childress runs the so-called West Coast offense.

"That's just a term," Johnson said. "It's really called the 'Canadian Border'
offense. What you'll see of it is what you want to see. The biggest thing for me
right now is building relationships with the coach and offensive coordinator,
knowing what they like. It's about concepts as much as anything."

) Gophers women's basketball coach Pam Bortonhas lost five players the past two
weeks for what she said were various reasons, but she wouldn't elaborate on them
Wednesday. She also said she doesn't expect any more departures.

It hasn't been easy for Borton. Although she said she was able to sleep Tuesday
night, she said she didn't sleep Monday night.

)As the No. 1 pick Wednesday in the WNBA draft, the Lynx's Seimone Augustus will
receive a salary of $42,400 this year, $43,248 for 2007, $44,096 for 2008, with
an option season of $46,301 for 2009.

)Hardly anyone noticed, but ex-Gopher Tom Lehman last week surpassed the $18

golf's all-time list. Jack Nicklaus ranks No. 119 with earnings of $5,734,031,
Arnold Palmer No. 271 with $1,861,857. No. 1 is Tiger Woods ($57,940,144).

235-pound linebacker Ernie Sims of Florida State as the Vikings' top choice with
their No. 17 pick on April 29. For those concerned about Sims' size, consider
that he's the same size as former Chicago Bears great Mike Singletary.
Linebacker remains the Vikings' most pressing need.

New steroids policy gets players' OK;
RED SOX SHIP OFF RENTERIA TO BRAVES; TIGERS LAND ROGERS

BYLINE: Mercury News Wire Services

SECTION: SP; Pg. 21

LENGTH: 678 words


Major league players on Thursday approved a steroid agreement that toughens
penalties and could result in a lifetime ban for three-time offenders.

The players' association executive board approved the deal worked out with
management Nov. 15 under the threat of even tougher legislation from Congress.

Union leader Donald Fehr said there was no need for all players to vote on the
agreement because there were no real objections.

Baseball owners approved the deal last month, and the union's acceptance
formalizes the pact reached in earlier negotiations.

Under the agreement, players will be suspended 50 games without pay for a first
offense and 100 for a second offense. A third positive test would result in a
lifetime ban. Baseball's current penalties are a 10-day suspension for a first
offense, 30 days for a second offense and 60 days for a third. The earliest a
player could be banned for life was a fifth offense.

The deal also includes testing for amphetamines, which many have called an even
bigger problem. A first positive test would lead to mandatory additional
testing, a second offense would draw a 25-game suspension, and a third offense
would get 80 games.

The Boston Red Sox traded Edgar Renteria to the Atlanta Braves for third baseman
Andy Marte, giving up on the two-time Gold Glove shortstop after just one
season. Renteria led the majors with 30 errors in 2005 after signing a
four-year, $40 million contract.

Boston will pay $8 million of the $26 million Renteria is owed for the next
three seasons. In addition, the Red Sox must pay the $3 million buyout if his
$11 million option for 2009 is declined.

Red Sox executive Bill Lajoie said the team was looking at free agents who were
not offered arbitration to replace Renteria. That group includes Alex Gonzalez,
Royce Clayton, Pokey Reese and Rey Sanchez.

Marte, 22, hit .275 with 20 home runs and 74 RBIs in 109 games in Triple-A last
season, and .140 with no homers and four RBIs in 24 games with the Braves.

All-Star pitcher Kenny Rogers, 41, agreed to a two-year, $16 million contract
with the Detroit Tigers. Detroit also reached an $11 million, two-year deal with
free-agent Todd Jones, returning the veteran closer to the team he pitched for
in 1997-2001.

Rogers was 14-8 with a 3.46 ERA in 2005 but will be most remembered for a
videotaped tirade June 29 in which he shoved two television cameramen while
walking onto the field. He was suspended for 13 games.

Jones was 1-5 with a 2.10 ERA and 40 saves last season for the Florida Marlins.

Baltimore Orioles shortstop Miguel Tejada said he's unhappy with the team and
wants to be traded.

``I've been with the Orioles for two years and things haven't gone in the
direction that we were expecting, so I think the best thing will be a change of
scenery,'' Tejada told the Associated Press during a phone interview from the
Dominican Republic.

Tejada signed a six-year, $72 million contract with the Orioles before the 2004
season. He hit .304 with 26 home runs and 98 RBIs.

``I've done many things with this team and I haven't seen results, and the other
teams are getting stronger while the Orioles have not made any signings to
strengthen the club,'' Tejada said.

Catcher Ramon Hernandez and the Orioles have agreed to a four-year, $27.5
million contract. Hernandez hit .290 with 12 home runs and 58 RBIs last season
with the San Diego Padres.

Reliever Jose Mesa agreed to a one-year contract with the Colorado Rockies. He
was 2-8 with a 4.76 ERA and 27 saves for the Pittsburgh Pirates last season.

The Chicago White Sox acquired utilityman Rob Mackowiak from the Pirates for
left-handed reliever Damaso Marte.

The New York Yankees traded utilityman Tony Womack to the Cincinnati Reds for
two minor leaguers, infielder Kevin Howard and outfielder Ben Himes, and agreed
with left-handed reliever Mike Myers on a two-year, $2.4 million deal.

Right-hander Elmer Dessens agreed to a two-year contract with the Kansas City
Royals.

Infielder Jose Valentin agreed to a one-year, $912,500 contract with the New
York Mets.

Sun Bowl notebook: Georgia Tech Offense is all about options

BYLINE: By Evan Mohl and Bill Knight \ El Paso Times

SECTION: SPORTS

LENGTH: 418 words


The Yellow Jackets' run-first offense is almost always referred to as the triple
option attack.

According to Georgia Tech's Sports Information Department, that is actually
incorrect.

The Yellow Jackets' scheme should be called a spread option, since the triple
option -- where there are three potential ball carriers -- simply describes one
play or a series of plays within the Georgia Tech offense. The Yellow Jackets
run the triple option about 20 percent of the time.

Georgia Tech's offense employs two A-Backs, or slot-backs, that line up outside
the tackles and often go out for passes. The B-Back, or fullback, lines up
directly behind the quarterback, while there are two wide receivers and no tight
ends.

Georgia Tech coach Paul Johnson is often credited as one of the modern pioneers
of the option offense. This year, the Yellow Jackets' ground attack ranks third
in the country at 316.83 yards a game, while Tech had the best scoring offense
in the ACC at 34 points a game.

"You're not going to stop that offense," Utah coach Kyle Whittingham said. "You
just hope to slow it down a little bit."

Utah's rushing defense is seventh in the nation, at just 97 yards a contest.

"The biggest challenge will be to block their down guys," Johnson said. "But we
can't change what we do."

Suspension

Georgia Tech offensive tackle Phil Smith was suspended Wednesday for the Sun
Bowl.

Georgia Tech assistant athletic director Dean Buchan confirmed the suspension,
saying that Smith violated team rules.

Smith played in 10 games this year and was part of a rotation at the tackle
position. His replacement has not been announced .

Smith became the second Georgia Tech player to be suspended for the Sun Bowl.
Before the Yellow Jackets arrived in El Paso, starting corner back Louis Young
was deemed ineligible for disciplinary reasons.

On elevation

Johnson displayed a dry sense of humor when asked about conditioning his team to
play at the nearly 4,000-foot elevation in El Paso.

"Yeah, he said, straight-faced, "we went to the highest water tower in Atlanta
and ran some laps around it."

The longtime assistant at the University of Hawaii pointed out that they faced
that every year in the old WAC -- leaving Honolulu to play in Wyoming, Colorado
State, Air Force, New Mexico and UTEP.

"It is what it is," Johnson said. "We condition like we always do, get ready to
play and go play."

Bears heading to NFL Combine with focus on offensive linemen

BYLINE: By Bob LeGere rlegere@dailyherald.com

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 4

LENGTH: 643 words


All things considered, the Bears probably would be content to enter the alleged
2011 season status quo on defense and special teams.

But the offense is another matter, which is why general manager Jerry Angelo and
Bears coaches and scouts will be looking more closely at players on that side of
the ball during this year's NFL Scouting Combine, whichbegins today in
Indianapolis.

"I'm excited about the direction our offense is going," Bears coach Lovie Smith
said. "Our defense ... we have some special players on that side of the ball. We
made a stand this year to get back on top and hopefully all three phases we'll
be talking about next year."

But that won't happen without an infusion of talent on offense. Since the Bears
aren't expected to be major players in free agency, which is uncertain with the
labor dispute still unresolved, that leaves the draft.

While the defense was top 10 in most of the significant categories and special
teams finished fourth overall in the Dallas Morning News' comprehensive
rankings, the offense did not rank above 21st in any key category.

The offense was decidedly better at the end of the season than it was when the
season opened, and it showed some encouraging signs for the future.

"It just has to come together," Angelo said. "I feel good about what the offense
did given we had a first-year coordinator (Mike Martz) coming in here, a new
offensive line coach (Mike Tice), a whole new offense, (and) a new cast of young
players."

But the offensive line struggled all season to protect quarterback Jay Cutler,
and it stumbled through some difficult games against top teams.

The Bears scored just 3 points in a 14-point loss to the New York Giants in
which Cutler was sacked nine times in the first half. And they were held to 7
points in a 29-point loss to the New England Patriots and just 3 points in the
regular-season-ending loss to the Green Bay Packers, in which the defense
allowed just 10 points.

That's why the Bears are expected to use their first-round pick (No. 29 overall)
on an offensive lineman.

There are several offensive tackles with first-round ability, led by USC's Tyron
Smith, Colorado's Nate Solder, Wisconsin's Gabe Carimi and Boston College's
Anthony Castonzo, a Lake Zurich High School graduate.

Many early mock drafts have all four off the board by the 29th pick, but if any
of them fall to the Bears, they'd be thrilled.

Mel Kiper's latest mock draft has them taking Villanova offensive tackle Ben
Ijalana in the first round, but Mississippi State's Derek Sherrod is rated
higher on many draft boards.

Another consideration could be Florida guard-center Mike Pouncey, whose twin
brother Maurkice was a Pro Bowl center for the Pittsburgh Steelers last season
as a rookie.

Other than offensive line, the most likely offensive position to receive
draft-day attention is wide receiver. Although that position isn't a desperate
need for the Bears, a big, physical weapon would complement the youthful speed
that already exists.

Georgia's A.J. Green will be long gone by No. 29, and so will Alabama's Julio
Jones. Maryland's Torrey Smith, Boise State's Titus Young and Pittsburgh's
Jonathan Baldwin all could be available to the Bears, but it would be a shock if
they passed up an offensive lineman with their first pick.

Only once in the past eight years have the Bears used a first-round pick on an
offensive lineman, and in that time they've only selected one offensive lineman
in the first three rounds. They took Chris Williams 14th overall in 2008, with
inconsistent results.

The intention was for Williams to be the Bears' left tackle for the next decade.
So far he has started seven games at left tackle, 11 at right tackle, and the
final 13 games last season at left guard with mixed reviews.

GEORGIA TECH FOOTBALL;
GEORGIA TECH PREVIEW: A MATTER OF TIME;
Will Tech's offense work right away in the ACC? Terence Moore and Mark Bradley
debate:

BYLINE: TERENCE MOORE; Staff

SECTION: COLLEGE FOOTBALL; Pg. 10P

LENGTH: 377 words


NO, IT WON'T

One of these years (sooner rather than later, by the way), Georgia Tech will
become a triple-option monster during its ACC schedule and beyond.

Not this year, though.

This year, Paul Johnson's offense, which is rarely used among major college
programs, will spend more time scaring the players he inherited this season than
their opponents.

A-backs? B-backs? So, with three other folks in the backfield with the
quarterback, why isn't there a C-back? And since Johnson has Y-backs, why not
Z-backs, as if his Tech players would perfect such a thing these days, anyway?

The good news is that the Jackets aren't rumbling, bumbling and fumbling as much
from all of this running, pitching and diving on nearly every play as they did
during spring practice. The bad news is that the Jackets won't become proficient
with their new offense until later this season. Or longer than that. Give it
another recruiting class or two, and Tech's offense will become significantly
more potent than the one Navy used to reach five consecutive bowl games under
Johnson.

That said, there is a difference between now and the start of Johnson's Navy
career in 2002. Back then, he left his wonderful stint at Georgia Southern as
head coach to transform Navy into the nation's third-best rushing team after the
Midshipmen finished 35th the year before. In fact, under Johnson, Navy spent
four of the past five years leading Division I-A schools in rushing, including a
record three straight years through last season.

It's just that Navy already was an option team when Johnson arrived. Tech had a
pro-style offense under previous coach Chan Gailey. That means the Midshipmen
featured more of the right personnel for Johnson's offense from the start
compared to the Jackets' current situation.

One more thing: The key to any offense is the quarterback --- especially with
the triple option --- and sophomore Josh Nesbitt is evolving into the Jackets'
starting quarterback during and after their home opener on Thursday against
Jacksonville State. Nesbitt played little last season, but he played a lot as a
senior at Greensboro High School, where the team passed nearly 45 times per
game.

Nesbitt might throw nine times per game under Johnson.

Yeah, this will take awhile.

Basketball: Bryant must stand trial on sexual assault charge

Kobe Bryant must stand trial on a charge of sexually assaulting a 19-year-old
resort worker, a judge ruled yesterday in Eagle, Colorado, clearing the way for
a celebrity trial the likes of which hasn't been seen since O.J. Simpson. Judge
Frederick Gannett said prosecutors presented enough evidence Bryant might have
committed the crime June 30. The Los Angeles Lakers guard could face a life
sentence if convicted. His next appearance, in district court, is set for Nov.
10. The defence can appeal Gannett's ruling, but such appeals are rare, legal
experts said.

Basketball: Mavericks acquire Walker from Celtics

The Dallas Mavericks bulked up an already strong offence yesterday, acquiring
all-star forward Antoine Walker from the Boston Celtics in a five-player trade.
The Celtics agreed to take centre Raef LaFrentz and the four years remaining on
a $69 million U.S., five-year contract signed before last season. The Celtics
also get Jiri Welsch and Chris Mills, players the Mavericks got in an offseason
trade that also brought Antawn Jamison from Golden State, and Dallas'
first-round pick in 2004. The Mavericks will get guard Tony Delk from Boston.

Basketball: Webber, Richardson face NBA suspensions

Chris Webber of the Sacramento Kings and Jason Richardson of the Golden State
Warriors probably will be suspended for the start of the NBA season because of
their separate legal cases. Russ Granik, the NBA's deputy commissioner, gave no
further details on possible punishments during a conference call yesterday.
Webber, a six-foot-10 forward, pleaded guilty to charges of lying to a grand
jury about his relationship with a Michigan booster who contended he lent
$616,000 to Webber and three other Wolverines. Richardson was convicted of a
misdemeanour domestic violence charge stemming from an assault on his
ex-girlfriend.

Basketball: Rodman crashes motorcycle outside strip club

Dennis Rodman was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol after he
crashed a motorcycle while doing stunts outside a Las Vegas strip club, police
said. Rodman, who was treated Sunday for cuts on his legs, was issued a summons
to appear in court for an arraignment in three to five weeks, police said.

Football: Former Bomber suing TSN, commentators

A former Winnipeg Blue Bomber is suing TSN and three of its commentators,
alleging their on-air comments damaged his reputation. Brandon Dyson, an
offensive centre during the 2001 season with the Canadian Football League team,
filed a lawsuit last week against the TV network and commentators John Wells,
Chris Schultz and Glen Suitor. Dyson, 27, alleges the three ruined his
reputation during an Oct. 12, 2001, telecast of a Winnipeg-Edmonton game at
Commonwealth Stadium. Lawyer Ken Arenson said if Dyson, 27, wins the suit, "the
damages should be significant because it was broadcast repeatedly on national
television."

Football: Former Stampeders' president resigns

Former Calgary Stampeders president Stan Schwartz announced that he will not be
returning to the team for another season. Schwartz, who became president in
1996, was offered the position of executive vice-president and Chief Operating
Officer on Sept. 2, when the club announced the appointment of Mark McLoughlin
as president and CEO. Schwartz said his last day would be Oct. 31.

Figure Skating: Young takes bronze in men's singles

Pembroke-born Nicholas Young captured the bronze medal in men's singles on the
weekend at the Karl Schafer Memorial figure skating competition in Vienna,
Austria. He was third in the short program and freeskating final. Sabrina
Granata of Embrun, and Michael Fawcett of Newmarket, Ont., placed fifth in ice
dancing in their first international meet.

Curling: Merklinger drops final to Gaudet

afternoon semifinal, the Merklinger rink of third Darcie Walker, second Denna
Schell and lead Audrey Reddick defeated Christina Cadorin of Orangeville 10 -5.

Soccer: Misconduct costs Manchester United manager

Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson was given a two-match sideline ban and
fined 10,000 pounds ($22,000 Cdn) yesterday for improper conduct toward match
officials. Ferguson had a lengthy personal hearing with Football Association
officials over two charges of misconduct stemming from his behaviour in United's
game at Newcastle on Aug. 23. If Ferguson decides not to appeal, the ban will
start Saturday.

Baseball: Blue Jays not for sale

The mayor of Mexico City may want to bring the Toronto Blue Jays to his city,
but Jays president Paul Godfrey says that will be difficult since the team is
not for sale. Mayor Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador told reporters yesterday that he
had contacted the commissioner's office for Major League Baseball about the
possibility of bringing a team to Mexico City. Lopez Obrador several times
referred to the Blue Jays -- not to the Montreal Expos, which are openly for
sale. It was not clear if he had confused the two.

Auto Racing: Unser Jr. in serious condition

Two-time Indy 500 winner Al Unser Jr. was hospitalized in serious condition
yesterday after being injured in an all-terrain vehicle accident in Albuquerque,
New Mexico. He was riding the ATV alone in the woods Sunday when he went over an
embankment and broke his pelvis, his father, four-time Indy winner Al Unser Sr.,
said.

Auto Racing: Canadian Grand Prix back on life support

Molson Inc. and race promoter Normand Legault issued a joint statement yesterday
saying they'll work together to try and save the Canadian Grand Prix. Molson and
Legault said they were "reaffirming their determination to work together to keep
the Montreal Grand Prix on the Formula One race calendar."

AMERICAN PERVERT TO GO BACK FOR TRIAL

SECTION: First Edition; NEWS; Pg. 2

LENGTH: 352 words


An American who allegedly flew to the UK to have sex with young British girls
and was subsequently jailed for pornography offences now faces a fresh trial in
the US.

Raymond Bohning attempted to avoid extradition to the US after his release from
prison, arguing that it would be "an abuse of process" for him to face a second
trial in his homeland when all charges could have been brought against him in
the UK.

He stands accused in the US of the alleged "grooming" of minors via internet
chat rooms and possession of thousands of photographs and images relating to the
sexual abuse of children and babies.

His lawyers argued that the charges he faced in the UK were limited to only a
few of the images and "tailored" by the US and UK authorities to avoid overlap
and to ensure he could face "double punishment".

Alleged cross-border crimes stemming from "a single course of conduct" should be
prosecuted in one jurisdiction, it was argued.

But Lord Justice Scott Baker, sitting with Mr Justice Newman at the High Court
in London, disagreed.

The judges upheld a decision at Bow Street Magistrates' Court to send Bohning
back to America at the request of the US government.

Mr Justice Newman said extradition proceedings in the criminal sphere involved
"the public interest of sovereign states".

In Bohning's case, both the US and UK authorities were equally entitled in the
public interest to bring charges related to an alleged "vast scale of
offending".

The judge said Bohning, who lives in Florida, arrived in the UK in November 2003
and travelled to Birmingham and made two telephone calls to young girls.

"One of them, aged 13, lived in Birmingham, and he phoned her to arrange for
sexual relations with her", said the judge.

But her father overheard the call and told the police.

Bohning was arrested at his hotel. His laptop computer was seized and more than
10,000 images depicting sexual abuse of children and babies were recovered.

There were also emails and evidence of internet chat sessions with the two
British girls and another minor in Pennsylvania

Kelly, Vick: Stumbling Eagles won't veer from their fast-paced oense

BYLINE: Joan Niesen

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 7B

LENGTH: 354 words


Two consecutive losses removed from their hot start against the Washington
Redskins, coach Chip Kelly and the Philadelphia Eagles aren't ready to make
adjustments.

In conference calls Wednesday with the Denver media, Kelly and quarterback
Michael Vick affirmed their confidence in the Eagles' fast paced offense and
maintained that even the Broncos' NFL best offense wouldn't change their
approach.

"We need our offense to execute our game plan and to score points," Kelly said.
"That has nothing to do with what the Broncos' offense is doing, what the
Chiefs' offense is doing or who ever else we've played so far or are going to
continue to play."

The Eagles will be coming to Denver off a 10 day break, but Kelly said he hasn't
used that time to make any roster or lineup changes. Vick, who struggled against
Kansas City, completing only 43.3 percent of his passes, still has his coach's
confidence, and Kelly deflected much of his critique to the offense as an 11 man
unit.

"I'm fine with what we do," Vick said. "There's nothing wrong with it. I have a
great time running and executing the offense. We're still young. We've still got
a lot of work to do. A lot of things are still fresh for us, but we know enough
to go out there and put up points."

Even with all of the attention being paid to his hurry up offense early in this
season, Kelly on Wednesday was quick to simplify what he's doing and compare it
to Denver's attack.

"If we can find a way we can gain an advantage somehow, then we're going to try
to implement that and make ourselves a better team," Kelly said of his offense.
"I think it's no different than what Peyton (Manning) is doing there. Obviously
the offenses are different, but whenever I think Peyton feels like he can gain
an advantage doing something, he does it."

The Eagles have the second most total yards in the NFL 1,385 through three games
behind only the Broncos. No matter the system, Sunday's game at Sports Authority
Field at Mile High will be a showdown between two of the fastest, most exciting
schemes in the NFL this season.

Crowd noise

State Sen. Vicki McDonald, St. Paul: "The crowd was more into the game and the
team was a lot better than last week. I think this team is going to be good. The
people around where I sat were a lot more excited and enthusiastic, too."

Dana Guthrie, Norman, Okla. (Note: Guthrie was wearing a Wake Forest shirt and
his daughter Kelly is a good friend of Nebraska quarterback Zac Taylor):
"Ithought our offense (Nebraska) struggled a bit, and it was because Zac had a
lot of passes just dropped. It was a lot better than what I saw last week in
Norman. I think we (the Sooners) are going to get our butts kicked up here in a
couple of weeks if we don't find an offense. We (Nebraska) are finding an
offense that is working to improve."

Henry Henry (really his name, and his nickname is "Hack"), Hickory, N.C.: "I
don't think they (the Demon Deacons) are as good as they could be and I don't
know about Nebraska. Nebraska's offense only scored a touchdown and the defense
scored three touchdowns. I think that's our (Wake Forest's) fault. I think Zac
Taylor made the right move coming here â?¦ just look at what Nebraska's defense
did to our guy. I think Zac can play in this offense here."

Sue and Darren Anderson, Holdrege: "The new offense is coming along," said Sue.
"I know it's taking some time. But change is good when it works and it worked in
the second half." "The first half was not impressive," Darren said. "Maybe we
should go back to the old offense. But there were some good signs for the West
Coast offense in the second half."

Fritz Simpson, Omaha: "I thought the second half was great. Didn't the defense
look even better than last week? I thought so. In the second half our offense
was more aggressive and the blocking was better. It still may take a few years
to get this West Coast offense going full-speed."

Pam Discoe, Columbus: "We sat near the Wake Forest quarterback's father and
everybody was very polite. I think we had more fun, though. We sat near more
positive Nebraska fans this week. I was glad to see the offense finally score,
too."

Brody Welchert, Omaha: (Note: Brody turns 12 today) "It was really good defense.
This was my third game and they haven't always won, so that was good. I think
Taylor is passing better all the time." Cole Welchert, (Brody's 8-year-old
brother) added, "We made a lot of noise and had a lot of fun. I'd like to meet
the players sometime. They're good."

Law & Order METROPOLITAN PUBLIC SAFETY REPORT Ga. man ends standoff, releases
wife in Florida

BYLINE: By Christy Harrison STAFF WRITER

SECTION: STATE NEWS; Section C; Page 4

LENGTH: 929 words


A 15-hour standoff between a small army of FBI agents and a Brunswick man
accused of kidnapping his wife from a DeKalb County apartment ended peacefully
Tuesday afternoon in Florida.

Brady Adams, who police said snatched his wife, Sharee, at gunpoint from an
Avondale Estates apartment Monday morning, released her at 12:18 p.m. from the
Madison, Fla., hotel room where he'd held her hostage, said FBI Agent Marlen
Vogt.

Adams surrendered a few minutes later without incident. The FBI has charged
Adams with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution, Vogt said. He also faces local
kidnapping charges.

Witnesses said Sharee Adams - confused and disheveled - walked out of the
single-story motel with her hands above her head and with a slight limp. She'd
been shot in the left hip. Her clothes were dirty but not blood-stained,
witnesses said.

She was taken to the Madison County Hospital and then transferred to the
Tallahassee Regional Medical Center, police said.

The ordeal began during the weekend and escalated Monday, DeKalb police said.

Mrs. Adams called the DeKalb police twice Saturday to report that her husband
had come from Brunswick and was stalking her, said Capt. C.R. Maddox. Officers
filed a report and suggested she obtain a misdemeanor stalking warrant. There is
no indication that she did, police said.

At midmorning Monday, Brady Adams, 36, forced his way into the Avondale Crossing
apartment where his 20-year-old wife was staying with family and friends, police
said. While she was being wrestled into his car, police said, Brady shot his
wife in the hip.

A hotel clerk at the Deerwood Inn in Madison, Fla., reported that the couple
arrived at the motel early Monday afternoon. About 8 p.m. FBI agents began
converging on the hotel, said Robert Burns, who witnessed the scene. Almost 35
FBI agents from Tampa, Jacksonville and Tallahassee announced their presence at
9 p.m. Brady refused to surrender, and a hostage negotiator was brough in.

Adjacent apartment complexes scene of 3 College Park rapes

By Ralph Ellis STAFF WRITER

College Park police are investigating three rapes reported since last summer at
adjacent apartment complexes off Camp Creek Parkway.

Detectives think the same man attacked women in their bedrooms last week and on
June 19, 1993, at Cedarwood Apartments.

At next door Lakemont Apartments, a woman said three men raped her after she
accepted a ride on Dec. 31.

In both Cedarwood rapes, the man entered the apartments in the early morning
hours through a sliding glass door, held a gun while raping and sodomizing the
women, then stole money or personal items before leaving, Lt. Barry McWilliams
said.

Residents were immediately warned of the rapes with hand-delivered letters, said
Denise Koehl, property manager for LEDIC Management Group, and police alerted
residents through the community watch organization.

Security measures were increased after the 1993 attack, including installation
of security bars on sliding glass doors, Koehl said.

The woman raped in 1993 sued the apartment complex, alleging the owners could
have helped prevent the crime by fixing a faulty security pin on a sliding glass
door.

The woman who reported a rape at Lakemont Apartments said she accepted a ride
with two men who took her to an apartment, where they pulled out guns and forced
her to have sex with them and another man.

Airport corruption case resumes

ATLANTA: Round 2 of the Atlanta airport corruption case begins quietly in U.S.
District Court today. Prospective jurors in the trial of former City Councilman
D.L. "Buddy" Fowlkes will appear for preliminary questioning before Judge Jack
Camp at 9:30 a.m. Fowlkes has pleaded not guilty to a 55-count indictment
alleging he took monthly bribes for five years from a concessions operator at
Hartsfield International Airport. He was removed from office in December.
Members of the jury pool will fill out questionnaires, which will be reviewed by
prosecutors and defense attorneys by the end of the week. Final jury selection
is expected to be completed Monday, and testimony is likely to begin Tuesday.
The trial is expected to last five to 10 days.

FAYETTE COUNTY: Truck runs off road, killing driver. A tractor- trailer hauling
20 tons of garbage careened off Ga. 74 in south Peachtree City on Tuesday
morning, killing the driver and scattering so much trash that authorities had to
close one of Fayette County's busiest commuting routes. Tommy Brown, 32, was
thrown from the cab of his 18-wheeler when it ripped through 100 feet of
guardrail and overturned shortly past 2 a.m. near the Flat Creek bridge,
authorities said. "The driver's side was completely caved in," and Brown was
found lying between the cab and trailer about 30 feet off the road, said
Peachtree City Police Chief James Murray. Brown died instantly, the chief said.
Investigators don't know why Brown lost control of his truck, but Murray said he
apparently "was going too fast and couldn't make the curve."

ATLANTA: Prison fugitives arrested at bus station. Federal marshals arrested two
prison fugitives at the Atlanta Greyhound Bus terminal Monday night, a day after
they had used smuggled hacksaw blades to saw through bars at the Crisp County
Jail in Cordele. Jason Daniel Moorehead and Robert Jeffrey Conley were captured
without incident. A third fugitive was captured in Cordele on Sunday, while a
fourth, Charles James Henderson, was still at large. Moorehead was being held on
a carjacking charge. Conley and Henderson were being held on weapons charges.

Dolphins' lack of speed, offence, may hamper success out of playoffs

DATELINE: DAVIE, FLA.


A lack of an offensive punch has hurt the Miami Dolphins, especially in their
last three games when they only scored a combined 34 points.

Now out of the playoffs, the team is fighting to salvage a winning record at 7-7
heading into Sunday's home finale against Detroit.

The plan is to see what can be done against the Lions and then the following
week at New England send head coach Tony Sparano and offensive co-ordinator Dan
Henning into the off-season with optimism about the direction of the offence.

That might be a difficult task. Henning says the team this season hasn't had
more than three dynamic plays on offence out of "about 800 or so." The Dolphins
offence ranks 22nd overall and 31st in scoring.

"On our football team overall, we're missing dynamics," said Henning, who was
the architect of the Dolphins' offence in 2008 that helped Miami win the AFC
East for the first time in eight years with an 11-5 record.

He said there are other things missing from the Dolphins' game, including
dynamic kickoff or punt returns that give the offence excellent field position
or an interception return for a touchdown.

Despite having the same coaches from the 2008 team and even having some players
on the current roster who are more dynamic than previous Dolphins personnel,
Henning said there is a difference between this season's team and the AFC East
winners.

"As a team, we're not as efficient, consistent or effective as we were in 2008,"
he said.

Henning says the team needs speed. One reason behind the offence's lack of speed
has to do with the hand injury second-year wide receiver Brian Hartline suffered
in the 13-10 home loss to Cleveland on Dec. 5.

Speed has been a difficult issue for the Dolphins without Brian Hartline this
season. Brandon Marshall - brought in via trade with the Denver Broncos in the
off-season because of his size and ability to run after making a catch - only
has three touchdown catches and has been slowed by a right hamstring injury.
Slot receiver Davone Bess is tied with Marshall with 71 receptions but doesn't
have breakaway speed.

Sparano previously has noted other hurdles with the offence, including that the
Dolphins running game struggled with second-level blocking and that red zone
efficiency was a concern.

Marshall deferred to Henning's opinion on speed but became defensive when
reporters questioned his game.

Cowboys offense still humming

BYLINE: GINA MIZELL

SECTION: SPORTS; OSU NOTEBOOK; Pg. 4C

LENGTH: 589 words


After the 2011 season, Oklahoma State lost two first-round draft picks - and
arguably the best two players at their respective positions in school history -
in quarterback Brandon Weeden and wide receiver Justin Blackmon.

Then in the first offensive series of the Cowboys' third game, they lost their
starting quarterback in Wes Lunt.

Still, the Cowboys' up-tempo spread offense has continued to roll so far in
2012. OSU ranks in the top six in the nation in scoring offense (first-62.33
yards per game), total offense (first-686.67 yards per game), passing offense
(fourth-378.33 yards per game) and rushing offense (sixth-308.33 yards per
game).

"We've got pretty good players," OSU coach Mike Gundy said. "I think we have a
good scheme and we have flexibility in our offense and we can do different
things...we've always tried to have some sort of a system that gave us
flexibility to do both (run and pass).

"I don't know that anybody has a perfect system, but we have to be able to make
adjustments."

Of course, a school named Savannah State skews these numbers. And Gundy
cautioned not to read too much into the offensive stats right now, since the
meat of the Cowboys' schedule is still ahead, starting with their Big 12 opener
against Texas on Sept. 29.

KICKOFF TIME, TV SET FOR OSU-TEXAS

OSU officially announced Monday morning that its Sept. 29 game against No. 12
Texas at Boone Pickens Stadium will kick off at 6:50 p.m. and will be televised
nationally by Fox.

FOX released a tentative schedule last month that said the game would kick off
at 6:30 p.m. That schedule also included the OSU-Kansas State game, which is
slated for a 2 p.m. kickoff in Manhattan.

OSU has won two consecutive games against Texas, with both victories coming in
Austin. It will be the Big 12 opener for both teams, as the Cowboys and
Longhorns have a bye this week.

Next Saturday's game will be OSU's second-ever appearance on Fox, the first
being the 2010 Cotton Bowl against Mississippi.

WALK-ON JASE CHILCOAT COULD RETURN AS NO. 3 QB

With Lunt out with a knee injury for at least the immediate future, OSU is now
only two deep at quarterback.

J.W. Walsh and Clint Chelf are the new 1-2, of course. But the other two
quarterbacks on the roster - Daxx Garman and Cody Peterson - are both ineligible
this season, offensive coordinator Todd Monken said following Saturday's win
against Louisiana-Lafayette. Garman is sitting out and redshirting after
transferring from Arizona, while Peterson is a walk-on who transferred from
Arizona Western Junior College.

So, who's No. 3?

Jase Chilcoat, perhaps?

Chilcoat is no longer playing football, but at one time was a walk-on
quarterback from Midwest City.

"He's still around campus somewhere," Monken said. "We'll have to re-call him,
because we don't have anybody else. I was on the headset going, 'Might have to
get him,' because at least he knows some of what we're doing.

"Otherwise, you'd have to go Joe Randle in the Wildcat (formation)."

Was Monken joking? Half-joking? Maybe, maybe not. OSU coach Mike Gundy said
Chilcoat could be an option.

And Chilcoat is definitely "around campus somewhere." In fact, he was amongst
the press Saturday, practicing doing radio play-by-play of the game as part of a
broadcasting class that Voice of the Cowboys Dave Hunziker teaches in OSU's
sports media program.

Is it time for Chilcoat to get out of the broadcast booth and onto the practice
field this week?

"I don't know what my life will be like in 24 hours..." Chilcoat said in a tweet
Monday afternoon.

WVU on pace to shatter Big East passing records

BYLINE: Jack Bogaczyk, Sports Editor

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. P8D

LENGTH: 940 words


West Virginia heads to Rutgers on Saturday ranked 13th nationally in total
offense ... and at the Mountaineers' current rate, it's an offense the Big East
never has seen before in the conference's 20-year football history.

WVU is averaging 489.9 yards per game, and will go against the Big East's top
two defenses statistically - Louisville (ranked 15th nationally) and Rutgers
(17th) - in the next two weeks.

If WVU can sustain that average, Coach Dana Holgorsen's debut season will bring
a Big East record for total offense for a season. WVU's current average projects
to a 6,368-yard season. The conference record is 6,179, set by Louisville in
2006.

The Mountaineers school record would be obliterated. It's 5,998, in the same '06
season as the Cardinals set the league standard. That 5,998 is No. 3 in Big East
history, with the Louisville and WVU total offense numbers sandwiching a 6,074
by Miami (Fla.) in 2002.

With the proliferation of offense in major college football, however, the
Mountaineers will have to go some to get another top 10 finish in total offense.
In WVU history, the 'Eers have been a top-10 offense eight times.

The best total offense ranking came in 1955, when West Virginia averaged 384.5
yards and finished second behind national champion Oklahoma's 410.7.

Those Mountaineers finished 8-2 (losing to Pitt and Syracuse), won the Southern
Conference, and were ranked No. 19 in the final AP poll.

Six of West Virginia's eight top 10 total offense seasons came between 1952-70.

The other two were the 11-2 team in 2006, which was fourth at an average of
461.4, and the 11-1 team in 1988, which placed fifth at 482.7 yards per game.

The Big East passing record for a season also is in danger, thanks to
Holgorsen's designs and quarterback Geno Smith's arm.

West Virginia is fifth nationally in passing yardage to date, averaging 374.4
yards per game. Project that average over 13 games, and the total would be 4,868
... which wouldn't break the big East standard, but pancake it.

The best Big East passing season was Louisville's 4,103 yards in 2007, followed
by Cincinnati in 2009, at 4,014.

To date, no other team in Big East history has thrown for more than 3,770 yards
(Louisville '06) in a season.

Yes, WVU traditionally has run for its yardage ... which is why it shouldn't be
surprising to know that the current passing total of 2,621 yards (in only seven
games) ranks fifth among WVU air-yard seasons.

With 149 yards in Saturday's 3:30 p.m. game in New Jersey, the 2011 team will
pass last year's club for No. 2 on the all-time school list, behind only the
very reachable 3,700 in 1998 when Marc Bulger was pitching.

---

THERE IS no argument that West Virginia's offensive productivity has improved
this season under Holgorsen. Although the new Mountaineers coach has complained
about his team's lack of efficiency, the ability to move the chains has improved
significantly from the 2010 team in one area.

Through seven games, WVU has gone three-and-out to punt only 11 times. It hasn't
happened more than twice in any game to date. In last season's first seven games
- also a 5-2 start - the Mountaineers already had experienced 26 three-and-outs.

WVU has had two three-and-outs against Syracuse, Connecticut, Marshall and
Norfolk State, and one only against LSU, Maryland and Bowling Green.

---

TO PUT the Mountaineers' 49-23 loss at Syracuse a week ago into a different
perspective, it was West Virginia's 1,197th game in school history ... and only
13 times has WVU allowed more points than it did to the Orange in the Carrier
Dome.

In the 13 games in which West Virginia has allowed 50 or more points, in 11 of
those the Mountaineers were outscored by 42 or more points. The other two?

WVU lost 52-20 at Boston University in 1949, and at Colorado State 50-14 to end
the 1978 season.

---

A FORMER West Virginia athletics administrator is back in the Big East with a
bigger job. Congratulations to Whit Babcock, named last weekend as the new
athletic director at Cincinnati.

Babcock left WVU in 2007 after five years as an associate athletic director and
executive director of the Mountaineer Athletic Club. He moved then to Missouri
as the No. 2 man in the Tigers' athletic department, and is making a move just
as Mizzou leaves the Big 12 for the SEC.

Babcock's fundraising skills helped him and the job at UC, which is trying to
brand itself in a pro sports market. He also will face the challenge of trying
to keep the Bearcats' relevant in the current college realignment game of
musical chairs.

The folks in Cincinnati will find Babcock, 41, candid to a fault. When he was
introduced formally on Monday at UC and asked about the tenuous future of the
Big East, he didn't blink and said what the league needed was trust and
stability.

"And right now, I don't know that the Big East has either," Babcock continued.
"But there's a chance to pull it together with the addition of teams, and once
we see what the Big 12 does, hopefully things will settle down and the Big East
can build back.

"But that trust and stability right now is wavering, and we've got to get that
back."

In a Q&A with the Cincinnati Enquirer, asked about what a good athletic director
does, Babcock didn't flinch.

"If I have to break it down, the simplest leadership role of an athletic
director boils down to character and competence," Babcock responded. "If I prove
to have character in what I say and I shoot people straight and I'm the same
publicly as I am privately, I believe that's absolutely key.

"At the same time, I've got to have competence. I've got to be able to have some
victories under my belt and show people that I know what I'm talking about."

Razorbacks rebuilding under their new coach

BYLINE: Josh Weinfuss, The News Herald, Panama City, Fla.

SECTION: SPORTS

LENGTH: 612 words


Oct. 3--FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. -- , Ark.

These aren't your grandmother's Arkansas Razorbacks.

Or the ones that Frank Broyles, Lou Holtz and Houston Nutt once coached. They're
not even a shadow of the team that lost to Florida in the 2006 SEC Championship
Game in Atlanta.

It's a rebuilding year for Arkansas football, and four games into the tenure of
coach Bobby Petrino, the same Razorback faithful that ran Nutt out of
Fayetteville has remained quiet.

Maybe they are counting on Petrino's history of grooming quarterbacks into BCS
bowl playmakers, like he did with Jake Plummer at Arizona State. Maybe they hope
he can land blue-chip recruits such as Darren McFadden and Felix Jones, like
Nutt did at Arkansas, or Michael Bush and Brian Brohm, as Petrino did at
Louisville.

Or maybe they're just hoping Petrino doesn't turn his back on a rebuilding
project like he did last year with the Atlanta Falcons, resigning after 14 weeks
of a 17-week season.

During two years of big-time bowl berths and back-to-back trips to New York City
for the Heisman Trophy ceremony, the Razorbacks enjoyed the company of college
football's elite programs. Now they are back at ground level.

They won their first two games of the season by a combined five points over
Western Illinois and Louisiana-Monroe. Then came a 49-14 loss to No. 2 Alabama
and a 52-10 loss to No. 5 Texas in consecutive weeks.

Arkansas' running game, the fourth best in the country last season, is ranked
109th out of 119 Bowl Subdivision teams and accounts for 90.5 yards per game.

"It was really just falling behind during the ballgame, we keep saying that week
in and week out," Arkansas center Jonathan Luigs said. "When you get behind by
that big of a deficit, you've got to fight the clock trying to get back into the
game and the quickest way is through the air."

Leading this year's offense, which lost five players to the NFL Draft, is
seniorquarterbackCaseyDick.Once a backup to Mitch Mustain, who was part of the
highly touted quarterback class of 2006 that included Florida's Tim Tebow and
Georgia's Matthew Stafford, Dick has established himself in Arkansas' record
books. He's in the Top 8 in touchdown passes (39), completion list (442),
attempts (620) and passing yards (4,239).

In his first year running Petrino's power-spread offense, Dick has thrown five
touchdowns and averages 242.2 yards passing yards. Yet Dick and the offense
remain a work in progress.

"You try to be patient," Petrino said. "That's easier said than done. He's
working extremely hard. He gives us the best chance to operate our offense. He's
really dedicated and he's taken a lot of the blame on his own shoulders."

Dick has picked up his new offense well, with six receivers having more than 100
yards this season. Petrino's coaching history makes it a good bet that the
Razorbacks will have one of the most potent offenses in the country during the
next few years.

Arkansas' passing offense is ranked 29th in the country with 259.5 yards per
game, eerily similar to Louisville's passing offense during Petrino's first year
there in 2003: ranked 29th, averaging 260.69. After four years at Louisville,
the Cardinals were in the Top 10 in passing offense, total offense and scoring
offense, and played in the Orange Bowl.

Marlins add Daulton's bat to slumping offense

BYLINE: FROM NEWS SERVICES

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 04D

LENGTH: 448 words


The Florida Marlins' offense is limping toward August, so the addition of
sore-kneed Darren Daulton might be a perfect fit.

The Marlins acquired the left-handed-hitting Daulton from the Phillies for Billy
McMillon, a sweet-swinging minor-league outfielder. Daulton is hitting .264 with
11 home runs and 42 RBIs.

"We need to score more runs on a consistent basis, and we haven't done that -
particularly against right-handed pitching," Marlins general manager Dave
Dombrowski said. "Our plans are Daulton can play a lot of first base against
right-handers, as well as some outfield."

The addition of Daulton casts a haze over the future of Jeff Conine, hitting
just .232 with 37 RBIs, who figures to return to left field several times a
week.

"I just picked up 28 games in the National League East standings," said Daulton,
who leaves the last-place Phillies for the second-place Marlins. "That's got to
say a little about what kind of club the Marlins have. They're only five games
(actually six) out of Atlanta."

Daulton expects to be a short-term Marlin. The team has an option to pick up his
contract in 1998 for $ 5 million, or buy it out for $ 500,000.

After missing almost all of the 1996 season after undergoing surgery on his
right knee for the ninth time, Daulton came back to start 78 of the Phillies' 96
games this season. Of those, 69 were in right field.

"This guy has been unbelievable," Phillies manager Terry Francona said. "I've
never seen a player I respect more in my life than Darren."

Whiten jailed in Milwaukee

New York Yankees outfielder Mark Whiten was arrested in Milwaukee on a charge of
second-degree sexual assault and was to spend the night in jail, police said.

Neither police nor the Yankees released any details regarding the alleged
incident. The district attorney's office will review the case today and decide
whether to file a charge.

Whiten, who played briefly with the Atlanta Braves in 1996, was batting .245
with five home runs and 23 RBIs in 200 at-bats for the Yankees.

Vaughn not charged

Mo Vaughn will not be charged with assault in Cleveland unless a man who says
the Boston Red Sox first baseman hit him in the mouth can present more evidence.

"We're not doing anything at the moment," chief prosecutor Carolyn Allen said.
Scott Bird, a 24-year-old from North Olmsted, Ohio, said his teeth were loosened
and his lip cut during a scuffle in the doorway of a nude dance club early
Saturday. Bird filed a police complaint saying the AL's 1995 MVP hit him.

"I wasn't at fault with what happened," Vaughn said when informed of the
prosecutor's decision. "I'm glad to get past that and get over with it."

DUEL PERSONALITIES (FINAL); BULLDOGS' NEW COACH ABOUT TO GET HIS FIRST TASTE OF
PERENNIAL RIVALRY; REVELING IN RIVALRY (SUNRISE)

BYLINE: RICK BROWN The Ledger

SECTION: Sports; Pg. C1

LENGTH: 654 words


Mark Richt has never participated in a Florida-Georgia football game. He has
never played in one. He has never coached in one.

The first-year coach of the Georgia Bulldogs, however, realize the rich history
behind this border rivalry.

He knows that books have been written about this game. He knows that this game
has gotten many a coach in hot water for losing as the Bulldogs have won just
one of the last 11 meetings against the Gators.

There is no anxiety in his voice -- nothing but a calm approach to this contest.

He gets the chance Saturday at 3:30 p.m. when his No. 15 Bulldogs take on the
No. 6 Gators in Jacksonville (Chs. 6, 10).

"We know it's a big game," said the 40-year-old Richt, who has Georgia 5-1 on
the season. "We know it means an awful lot. People are passionate about this
game for a lot of reasons."

Although this is his first year as a head coach, Richt has been in big games
before.

After 15 years with the Florida State Seminoles, the previous seven as the
offensive coordinator and quarterback coach, Richt has coached in the last three
national championship games (winning one) as well as the club's annual forays
against both Florida and Miami.

He has coached two Heisman Trophy quarterbacks -- FSU's Charlie Ward and Chris
Weinke -- and was called the brains behind FSU's high-powered attack.

In his tenure as coordinator, FSU finished in the nation's top five in scoring
offense on five occasions, top 12 in total offense five times and top 12 in
passing offense five times. His 2000 offense finished the regular season ranked
first in total offense, first in passing offense and third in scoring offense.

"The best thing Mark has is he's very, very cool," said FSU Coach Bobby Bowden.
"He doesn't fluster. He used to make me mad because he wouldn't get nervous like
me. It's hard to ruffle his feathers. It's always the same ole Mark. He's just
calm, calm, calm.

"He's done better than I would think for a first year coach, especially at a
place as pressurized as Georgia," he continued. "That's not one of those Ivy
League schools. Football up there is very important. I'm glad to see him having
success."

Of course, some of FSU's sets have found their way to Athens, Ga. At times, you
will see the Bulldogs go into a no-huddle offense. Sometimes, Georgia will
spread the field with four and five receivers.

And so far, the offense has been effective.

Last year, Georgia finished fifth in the league in passing offense, fifth in
scoring offense and ninth in total offense.

This year, the Bulldogs, however, are No. 2 in both passing offense and total
offense and are third in the SEC in scoring offense.

"They are a well balanced offense, and they have good players right at this
point in time making plays for them," said UF defensive coordinator Jon Hoke.
"It'll be a challenge for us defensively because of the things they do. It's
very similar to Florida State's scheme as you probably know. They had a lot of
success with it at Florida State and they are having similar success with it."

When he was hired Dec. 26, 2000, Richt wasn't told specifically there were teams
he had to defeat. Yet, he already knew his predecessor, Jim Donnan, despite a
40-19 overall record, was just 6-14 against UF, Tennessee, Auburn and Georgia
Tech.

Richt has already won over people by defeating Tennessee. If he can get his kids
to beat Florida, Georgia will be the frontrunner to earn a trip to the SEC title
game for a chance for the Bulldogs to win an 11th Southeastern Conference
championship.

"We know that to get where we want to go, we've got to beat Florida," he said.
"I didn't look at the rivalry all by itself. I just looked at the big picture
and know that the goal is to win all the games. Florida is on the schedule, so
is Tennessee and Auburn and others. I want to get the program to the point where
we have a shot at winning every game."

Notre Dame No. 2 in pre-season poll

BYLINE: By ERIC HANSEN, Tribune Staff Writer

SECTION: SPORTS; ANALYSIS; Pg. C1

LENGTH: 1062 words


SOUTH BEND -- The last time Notre Dame was ranked No. 2 in the nation in the
Associated Press writers poll, coach Lou Holtz was lisping to anyone who would
listen that the Irish were robbed of a national title.

It was the final poll of the 1993 season, and a 24-21 Cotton Bowl trumping of
Texas A&M allowed once-beaten ND to leap from No. 4 to No. 2. That put the Irish
behind only once-beaten Florida State -- a team it had beaten head to head on
Nov. 13 of that year to temporarily take over the No. 1 spot.

The Irish haven't been ranked higher than No. 3 since -- until now.

The preseason AP poll was released Friday evening, and Notre Dame is No. 2. If
everything goes according to form -- and last year was a rare instance in which
it did -- the Irish will play No. 1 Ohio State Jan. 8 in the national
championship game at Glendale, Ariz.

First ND must polish off three ranked opponents (No. 6 USC, No. 14 Michigan, No.
19 Penn State), three other teams that received votes in the poll (Georgia Tech,
Purdue, Michigan State) and six other squads.

The Irish open the 2006 season Sept. 2 at Georgia Tech (8:08 EDT, ABC-TV).

In the meantime, here are five intriguing, if not burning, questions facing the
Irish two weeks before their first kickoff and hopefully some equally
intriguing, if not smoldering, stabs at answers.

1. Can ND win a national title with a defense that's less than dominating?

No team in the eight-year BCS era has won a national title with a defense ranked
lower than 25th, and only one squad in the last six, the 2001 Ohio State
Buckeyes, did it with a unit ranked outside the top 10 (23rd). That also was the
worst offensive national champ of the BCS era, ranking 70th nationally in total
offense.

Last season, the Irish were 75th in total defense, 10th in total offense.

Second-year Notre Dame head coach Charlie Weis believes it's possible to win a
title with a different model, not that the Irish defense won't be faster, more
versatile and deeper in 2006. But an overwhelming offense paired with a
respectable defense, as was the case with USC last year (1st in offense, 48th on
defense), could be what the next wave of champions looks like. Certainly No. 1
Ohio State will open the season far stronger on offense than on defense.

Weis certainly changed the way Irish fans had pictured success. How many bad
puns were born out of Tyrone Willingham's West Coast offense experiment? And how
many ND followers were convinced a power running game was the dominant
ingredient in an offensive return to glory?

Well, Notre Dame finished fourth in the nation in passing offense last season,
the first time since 1979 the Irish has ranked in the top 20 in that category
and the only time since 1986 it had ranked higher than 49th.

It also marked the first time since 1986 that ND ranked higher nationally in
passing than it did in rushing.

2. Can the Irish offense improve over last season?

If history is any indication, Weis may not want to. The only two Irish head
coaches to improve the Irish offense in each of their first two seasons (since
the NCAA started charting national stat rankings in 1946) were Gerry Faust and
Willingham.

But neither improved them much. Faust took an offense that ranked 72nd, improved
it to 71st in his first year and to 67th in his second. Willingham inherited an
offense ranked 110th and nudged it to 108th and then 90th.

Weis, in comparison, took the No. 81 offense and improved it 71 spots. Of the
school's nine post-World War II permanent head coaches, only Ara Parseghian had
a more dramatic improvement on either side of the ball in his first year.
Parseghian too the Irish offense from 105th in 1963 to 2nd in 1964.

But given the number of offensive starters returning, the way the freshmen have
helped fill out the depth chart and Weis' ability to tweak (rather than install)
the offense this season, it's reasonable to conclude ND will be markedly better
on offense.

3. Who are the ND players most likely to surprise in 2006?

Keep in mind Sam Young, Darrin Walls and Munir Prince, etc., have lost the
element of surprise.

1. Senior safety Chinedum Ndukwe; 2. Senior linebacker Travis Thomas; 3.
Sophomore wide receiver David Grimes; 4. Freshman tight ends Konrad Reuland
and/or Will Yeatman; 5. Freshman running back Luke Schmidt; 6. Freshman
linebacker Toryan Smith; 7. Freshman kick returner George West.

4. What are the most pressing personnel issues to settle over the next couple of
weeks?

1. Picking a kicker (Ryan Burkhart, Carl Gioia); 2. Nailing down a starting
right offensive tackle (Sam Young, Brian Mattes, Paul Duncan); 3. Finding a
fourth receiver to go with Rhema McKnight, Jeff Samardzija and David Grimes (too
many candidates to name); 4. Narrowing down the candidates to be in ND's
multiple-defensive backs package (too many candidates to name); 5. Putting a
finer point on the No. 2 quarterback situation (Evan Sharpley, Zach Frazer,
Demetrius Jones).

5. What will recruits like most about this team?

On a team with 16 starters returning from 2005 and two more (Bob Morton and
Rhema McKnight) who have started in previous seasons, freshmen are finding their
way into the mix in abundance.

The best players play. Period. That's very appealing to high school seniors with
big stats and/or big egos.

PRO FOOTBALL;
Reeves Is Still Being Criticized in Denver

BYLINE: By MIKE FREEMAN

SECTION: Section 1; Page 35; Column 2; Sports Desk

LENGTH: 445 words

DATELINE: EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J., Oct. 11


The Broncos have cruised to the best record in the American Football Conference
and own the No. 1-ranked offense in the league, so you would think some of their
players would have better things to do than criticize Dan Reeves, the former
Denver coach. But apparently they don't, and there is some Reeves-bashing going
on in the Rocky Mountain State.

Late this week, an article in The Denver Post compared how offenses have fared
under Mike Shanahan, as an assistant under Reeves in Denver from 1984-87 and
1989-91, as an assistant with San Francisco and as the current head coach of the
Broncos -- with Reeves's offense in 1992, his last year in Denver (without
Shanahan), and from 1993 until the present with the Giants. The point of the
article was that Shanahan makes his offenses less complicated but more effective
and quarterback friendly than Reeves does.

Shanahan and Reeves had a major falling-out at the end of the 1991 season and
Shanahan left to coach with the 49ers. Reeves joined the Giants in 1993; their
offense that season ranked 10th over all but has slipped each year since. The
Giants' offense is now ranked 29th over all, out of 30 teams, and last in
passing.

Listen to what the Pro Bowl tight end Shannon Sharpe, in his seventh year with
Denver, told The Post.

"It's just a night-and-day difference between Mike and Dan," Sharpe said. "This
offense allows you so many options. There aren't as many seven-step drops where
there's a chance a quarterback can get sacked. He doesn't have to hold the ball
and wait for the receiver to get downfield. With this offense, we feel like if
we're clicking on half the cylinders, we can move the ball up and down the
field. I don't think we ever felt that in Dan's offense."

In Reeves's defense, there has been some recent loosening of the reins on the
Giants' offense. In the victory over the Vikings on Sept. 29, the play-calling
was less predictable and a big reason the Giants won. Quarterback Dave Brown,
though on an extremely tight leash, has been allowed to use more audibles this
year.

Still, Sharpe and some of the Broncos coaches brought up a good point: Reeves's
use of so many seven-step drops. Waiting for receivers to get open can often
lead to disaster. That is why Brown is sacked so often.

The moral of the story seems to be that a successful offense needs good players
-- John Elway isn't bad to start with. But maybe equally important, if not more
so, is the system. The players must digest it and believe in it.


EXTRA POINT

Center BRIAN WILLIAMS had some irritation in his ankle and sat out Friday's
practice. He will play Sunday against the Philadelphia Eagles.

Stoops opens eyes by opening offense

BYLINE: BRUCE LOWITT

SECTION: SPORTS; NATIONAL INSIDER: A WEEKLY REPORT ON COLLEGE FOOTBALL; Pg. 1C

LENGTH: 1045 words



Oklahoma winning with new coach Bob Stoops and (gasp!) a passing game.

You remember Oklahoma, don't you? Where Heisman Trophy winners were built from
the ground up, where quarterbacks went to disappear, where Bud Wilkinson and
Barry Switzer fostered offenses as conservative as J. C. Watts.

Now the wind that comes sweepin' down the plain is likely as not to be carrying
footballs through the air, and Bob Stoops couldn't be happier.

Stoops, architect of the Florida defense the past three years, is in his first
year as Oklahoma's head coach. When he took the job, he grabbed a Southeastern
Conference nemesis, recruiting Mike Leach from pass-happy Kentucky to be his
offensive coordinator. Then he got out of the way.

"From competing against this kind of offense with Kentucky for two years, I knew
how difficult it was going to be to defend against it," Stoops said, reflecting
on the Leach-directed Wildcat offense that set six NCAA records, 41 SEC marks
and 116 school records with Tim Couch at quarterback.

"I'm not involved in our offense," Stoops said. "I sit in meetings and do what I
can to contribute, something here or there, maybe analyze a defense and comment
on what it was trying to do.

"But this is Coach Leach's offense, with wrinkles from the other coaches. They
operate it themselves. That's what they do best. I don't want to get in and foul
it up."

It's working. Stoops' Sooners lead the nation in total offense (536 yards per
game), passing offense and scoring. Florida is ranked second in the nation in
total offense (518 yards per game).

"Yeah, dadgum Oklahoma guys," UF coach Steve Spurrier joked. "Can you believe
them, out there running up their stats? I think Oklahoma was 107th in the nation
last year in pass offense (actually tied with Wisconsin at No. 107), and  now
they're No. 1. Did they all of a sudden have a miraculous recruiting season?"

Well, yes. Having signed Leach, Stoops needed  a quarterback for his aerial
offense. No one on the  roster was up to it, so he recruited left-handed Josh
Heupel from Snow Junior College in Utah. Heupel leads the nation in total
offense and is the No. 3 passer.

When Watts, now a Republican congressman from Oklahoma, quarterbacked the
Sooners, he threw for a combined 1,690 yards in his two seasons (1979-80) as
their leading passer.

After three games, Heupel is  500 yards shy of that.

Last week, in a 42-21 victory at Louisville, Heupel broke his week-old Sooners
record with 429 passing yards. His five touchdown passes were one fewer than
Watts' two-year output.

For the record, the Oklahoma rushing offense is 66th among NCAA Division I-A
teams; senior Michael Thornton is 35th among rushers.

"Oklahoma fans think you're supposed to run it up and down the field all the
time," Spurrier said, "but as long as you win the game they'll accept that
passing, I think. Winning takes care of a lot of old habits."

Stoops agrees wholeheartedly. "Nobody's complaining about it right now," he said
of Sooners fans weaned on the wishbone. "Right now, being 3-0, everybody's
excited."

That record has elevated Oklahoma into the AP poll (No. 23) for the first time
since Sept. 23, 1995.

Stoops is suitably unimpressed.

"Being ranked in the Top 25 right now doesn't mean anything," he said. "We've
got a long road ahead of us. Our goal going into the season wasn't to be (No.
23) in the country. That isn't something you shoot for. Hopefully as the year
goes along we'll get stronger and better. We worry about what we can control,
concentrate on that, and let the rest care of itself."

Taking the Oklahoma job, succeeding Joe Blake, whose 5-6 finish in 1998
concluded a three-year, 12-22 run, was not a tough choice for Stoops. What he
saw, he said, was a history of 34 conference championships, six national
championships, a strong recruiting base throughout Oklahoma (and Texas next
door), and a fan base that sells out 72,726-seat Memorial Stadium.

Having rung up impressive numbers against Indiana State (49-0), Baylor (41-10)
and Louisville, the Sooners hit the big time today, visiting Notre Dame. South
Bend can be intimidating for the uninitiated, and Oklahoma hasn't played the
Fighting Irish in 31 years.

"Our players, and we as coaches, have great respect for Notre Dame football and
their tradition and all," Stoops said. "We're also aware that we have a great
tradition, too, and a lot of pride. So we've got two tradition-rich schools
ready to play.

"But that all goes out the window when you kick the ball off and you've got to
play for 60 minutes. Once you get to playing, tradition doesn't have a whole lot
of bearing on the game."

WESTERN ILLINOIS AT NEBRASKA | 5:10 p.m., Saturday Huskers come to pass Bill
Callahan's West Coast offense and QB Joe Dailey are stirring things up at
Nebraska.

BYLINE: John Henderson Denver Post Staff Writer

LENGTH: 857 words


Lincoln, Neb. - The new era in Nebraska football officially began April 17.
That's when starting quarterback Joe Dailey dropped back on the first play of
the spring game and threw a rocket downfield. It went over the receiver's head,
landing somewhere in the vicinity of North Platte. At which point 61,000 fans in
Memorial Stadium cheered.

Welcome to Air Corn.

When Nebraska opens its season at 5:10 p.m. Saturday against Division I-AA
Western Illinois, don't bother checking the temperature in Lincoln. It is hot
and sticky. Instead, check the temperature in hell. Apparently, it has frozen
over.

Nebraska is throwing the ball. The school that has led the nation in rushing 13
of the past 24 years and has run the ball on 73 percent of its downs since 1977
is joining the 21st century. The architect is Bill Calla-

han, who is bringing in the same West Coast offense that lifted his Oakland
Raiders to the Super Bowl two seasons ago.

In replacing the fired Frank Solich and Nebraska's prehistoric option, the
Cornhuskers are going from a 10-speed Schwinn to a 747. The difference is
operating a 747 may be easier than the West Coast offense.

"It's harder than any class I've ever had in college," said receiver Ross
Pilkington, a junior from Fort Collins.

Pilkington's playbook is 2 1/2 inches thick and weighs 8 pounds. At practice
Wednesday, Dailey had more than 300 plays scribbled on his forearm. He has
logged more time in classrooms than law students.

The West Coast offense is a ball-control passing attack. It uses multiple backs
and formations, and requires receivers to read defenses. Dailey must recognize
defensive sets in the time it takes to snap a football.

It has been successful in Oakland, Tampa Bay, Green Bay and at Invesco Field at
Mile High. It gets plenty of players in the offense, keeps defenses guessing and
is flexible for the personnel.

However, the downside is, well, let Dailey explain.

"It's a very complex offense," he said. "I think it's beyond comprehension. You
have to really excel in the classroom and on the field in order to understand
it."

The rap on the offense is it works in the NFL because staffs have eight hours a
day every day to work with their quarterbacks. It took Oakland's Rich Gannon
years before he became dangerous.

At Nebraska, Callahan has had Dailey for 20 spring practices and 20 hours a week
in camp. That's one reason West Coast offenses at Notre Dame and UCLA have yet
to take flight.

"The biggest challenge is condensing it," said UCLA coach Karl Dorrell, whose
Bruins use only 20 percent of the playbook he took from his days as a Broncos
assistant.

Callahan, however, is trying to draw an inside straight. He's not installing 20
percent of the Raiders' playbook. He's installing 100 percent. It's a gamble.
While the NCAA limits the amount of time on a practice field, it doesn't limit
the amount of time in front of a chalkboard.

"We had the opportunity to put in a normal day of installation very similar to
the pro schedule," Callahan said. "So I was really pleased with that one aspect
of training camp because you get five days of acclimation, you get one practice
a day but you can meet as long as you want to meet. So we grind it pretty good."

Another key to the West Coast offense is you need a quarterback with an athletic
body and a quick mind. Callahan has that in Dailey, who pulled a 3.17 grade
point average his freshman year and isn't cut from the same mold as past
Nebraska quarterbacks. At St. Peter's High School in Jersey City, N.J., he
threw, often out of the shotgun, for 19 touchdown passes as a senior.

He came to Nebraska last year when Solich promised the Huskers would throw more.
But starter Jammal Lord couldn't throw at all. Nebraska finished 114th out of
117 teams in passing, and Solich got fired.

"I totally believe in coach Callahan's philosophy," Dailey said. "You can
install the entire thing. It's just a matter of how hard your players want to
work, whether they're physically and mentally capable of installing it."

At Nebraska, it was about time. Solich's recruiting had dragged because of the
archaic system, and Callahan's NFL-style attack already is paying dividends.
Florida prep phenom Harrison Beck, whom rivals.com recruiting service ranks as
the No. 3 quarterback in the nation, already has committed to Nebraska.

Callahan sounds as if he's in Beck's living room when he says, "To get this type
of exposure for a college athlete, if you're a college freshman or sophomore,
boy, what an advantage you'd have over a lot of other players who aspire to go
to the NFL. You just become that much more ready."

Who's ready now is the editor of Nebraska's record book. The 49 passes Dailey
threw in the spring game would have broken the single-

game record of 42, set in 1972. The single-game passing yardage mark is 360 and
the single-season record is only 2,431.

"People want that," said Bob Cummings, a booster since 1978. "The last three or
four years people have been growling to throw the football more. I think they'll
be patient."

Patient? Nebraska? The devil just put on a parka.

COAST GUARD

The idea is to stay at least one step ahead of the defense. It always has been.
So, no, NFL defenses are not catching up to the West Coast offense.

They never will.

On that, you have the wisdom of three of the league's leading defensive
coordinators this season - Tom Olivadotti of the undefeated Miami Dolphins,
Gunther Cunningham of the undefeated Kansas City Chiefs and Willie Shaw of the
undefeated St. Louis Rams.

There may be others out there who think they have it figured out, but do not
count those three wise coaches among them.

What might look like progress is nothing more than mistaken numbers. Sure,
Jacksonville's West Coast offense is fairly easy to shut down. But what worked
so well for Bill Walsh and the San Francisco 49ers back in the early days of its
development, still works exceptionally well for the Niners some 15 years later
   and reasonably well for a few others.

"You can't really say defenses are catching up," said Olivadotti, "because the
definition of the West Coast offense is really just the controlled passing game,
and everybody in the league does something like that. It's not just San
Francisco and Green Bay anymore."

The only team in the league not running some version of the West Coast offense
is Atlanta, where the Falcons are still kind of running the run-and-shoot.

But the West Coast offense isn't really an offense, anymore, either.

"It's really more of a concept," than a specific collection of plays, said
Olivadotti. "It's the short passing game    always a guy in the control area,
never take a minus play and that kind of thing."

Given a steady diet of new practitioners of the West Coast offenses over the
past few years, said Shaw, the one adjustment most defenses have made is to go
back to the four-man front.

"That's what we did at San Diego last year, and we won six in a row, so that's
what I put in here," said Shaw. "It works better against the three-man because
by the time the defensive linemen penetrate, the ball's already gone.

"But it's really like any other offense. It depends on who's running it. When
you've got Steve Young and Jerry Rice    San Francisco's not having any trouble
moving the ball."

Said Cunningham, "They may be catching up with some of the other ones, but
they're not going to catch up with those guys."

Properly executed by the proper players, the West Coast offense is "a prolific
thing," said Cunningham. "When that thing's clicking, it's really hard to stop.
And certainly, San Francisco is still clicking."

It was with Denver Broncos coach Mike Shanahan as their offensive coordinator
that the Niners' offense clicked so well that it led the league in total offense
for three straight seasons.

Shanahan doesn't have Young or Rice in Denver, but he does have the league's
third-most-productive offense this season, just a short Terrell Davis run behind
the Dallas Cowboys and another game-winning touchdown pass by John Elway behind
the Niners.

But when Shanahan looks over his shoulder, he naturally thinks somebody's
gaining on him.

"There are so many teams that use the term 'West Coast offense' to describe what
they're doing anymore, it's hard to say," said Shanahan. "But, yeah, I think
defenses eventually catch up with everything and then offenses come up with
something else, and the defenses have to catch up again.

"What it comes down to is execution    how you execute any type of offense or
any type of defense and how good your players are.

"But I think the philosophy of the West Coast offense is very sound and if you
execute it properly, then it's very hard to stop."

What makes it so hard to stop, said Shanahan, "is that what you're trying to do
is get five people out, so that somebody's always going to open up right away,
which is why most of your plays are either off the three- or five-step drop.
Then, if the quarterback goes through his progression like he's supposed to,
it's hard for him to be wrong.

"Now, as in all offenses, you have to have the personnel that goes with the
quarterback, and the teams that are going to be the most successful are the
teams that are going to have some balance in the offensive line and skill people
that can execute it    because your receivers are going to have a chance to beat
defensive backs one-on-one and your backs have a chance to beat linebackers
one-on-one, so if you don't have that, you're going to have a hard time being
successful.

"But I really believe philosophically, that if you have the personnel, it's
still very hard to stop. But you can't have any weaknesses to really have the
offense click. It all starts with the offensive line, then it carries over to
the skill positions and, of course, you have to have the guy pulling the
trigger."

In Denver, Shanahan counts himself lucky because that guy is Elway, who has both
the skill and the experience to learn the offense quickly.

But even after two seasons with the Wade Phillips version of the West Coast
offense and three games with Shanahan, Elway still is having some of the same
problems as a number of the less-experienced quarterbacks.

The most common problem most quarterbacks have, said Young, is trusting the
progression.

"You've just got to make yourself go to the first guy who comes open, even if
it's just a 3- or 4-yard pattern," Young said. "A lot of guys don't want to do
that. They want to wait for something better to develop and that's when things
start breaking down, because everything is keyed on timing."

That's easy for Young to say, said Shanahan, because he's had eight years to
master the offense.

"Most guys get hung up because they stay on the first and second reads too long
or because they don't know where three, four and five are," said Shanahan.

"Steve has an innate ability that if one and two are covered to go to three or
four. And if they're all covered then he's got the athletic ability to improvise
something else. He's so good at it, because he's done it so much."

When an offense gets that good, said Cunningham, there's no way any defense is
going to catch up.

"That's when you better have an offense that can catch up," he said.

NFL 2004: A BREAKDOWN OF THE SCHEME: WEST COAST OFFENSE

SOURCE: AJC

SECTION: Sports; Pg. 7P

LENGTH: 81 words


In 1970, Bill Walsh --- a young assistant under legendary coach Paul Brown in
Cincinnati --- was forced to design an offense around a quarterback with a weak
but accurate arm. He came up with a plan that used short passes dictated by the
position of the defense. Years later, as a head coach in San Francisco, the West
Coast offense was perfected. It's been used around the NFL since, handed down to
assistants and copied. A version will be used by the Falcons this season.

LOAD-DATE: September 5, 2004

LANGUAGE: ENGLISH

GRAPHIC: Graphic: WEST COAST OFFENSE PHILOSOPHY

* Using the short pass to gain first downs and maintain possession of the ball.

* Having the quarterback release the ball quickly to avoid the rush and put it
in the hands of receivers and backs in a position where they can run.

* Timing pass routes with the quarterback's dropback so the receiver will be in
a precise spot as the quarterback finishes his drop and sets to throw.

* In addition to receivers, using backs and tight ends in the passing game out
of multiple formations to spread the field horizontally and vertically.
----
DISSECTION OF A PLAY
Former NFL coach Rod Dowhower broke down a quintessential West Coast offense
play, Red Right Scat Hank. The play is designed to go to a receiver with the
tight end and backs as secondary options.
1. Before the snap, the quarterback identifies the strong safety's position. The
quarterback eliminates the receiver and back on that side of the field as
potential targets. In this instance, the safety is on the tight end's side, or
the strong side. That means the flanker and fullback are not options; the split
end, halfback and tight end are.
2. On this play, with the strong safety on the strong side, the quarterback will
look for the receiver on the weak side of the field -- the split end -- as he
takes his five-step dropback. If the weakside linebacker does not defend the
passing lane between the quarterback and split end, the quarterback will plant
his back foot after his fifth step and throw, which should be at the same moment
the receiver turns back to the quarterback in his 12-yard "fishhook" route. All
bets are off if the defense blitzes. Then, depending on where the blitz comes
from, one of the backs or the tight end becomes the "hot," or primary, receiver.

3. If the weakside linebacker is in the passing lane and not defending the
"flat" -- the area just beyond the line of scrimmage on either side of the field
-- the quarterback will throw to the halfback slipping out of the backfield.
4. The tight end also is viable. If the quarterback sees that the middle
linebacker is not covering the tight end, who is running a 6-8-yard route across
the middle, that is the easiest option.

CURRENT NFL COACHES
How some noted West Coast offense coaches have fared since taking over their
current teams:

* Brian Billick (Baltimore)
Billick joined the Ravens after a 6-10 season in 1999. Two years later, they
were Super Bowl champions. He has an 84-22 (.718) record.

* Jeff Fisher (Houston/Tennessee)
Fisher took over the Oilers in the middle of the 1994 season. He has led them to
an 80-48 record (.625) and a trip to the Super Bowl.

* Jon Gruden (Tampa Bay)
After turning around Oakland, Gruden took over Tampa Bay in 2002. That first
season culminated in a Super Bowl title. The Buccaneers missed the playoffs last
season.

* Mike Holmgren (Seattle)
After making his name in Green Bay, Holmgren took over an 8-8 team in Seattle in
1999. The Seahawks have since gone 41-39 (.513) and made the playoffs last
season.

* Andy Reid (Philadelphia)
Reid took over an Eagles team that went 3-13 in 1998. He has since compiled a
51-29 (.638) record and three consecutive trips to the NFC Championship game.

* Mike Shanahan (Denver)
Shanahan joined Denver in 1995, taking over a team that went 7-9. In nine
seasons, he is 91-53 (.632), including back-to-back Super Bowl titles.

the grid line   Unbeaten Browns, Bucs   to face tough opponents

BYLINE: Jeffrey Goodman; GAM

LENGTH: 713 words

DATELINE: Troonto ON


Cleveland Browns and Tampa Bay Buccaneers, two of the four teams in the
 National Football League that are still undefeated, have tough opponents
 in the NFL's fifth week of play.

The Browns travel to Houston to play the Oilers, who beat the Browns
 twice last season and are only one game behind Cleveland in the AFC
 Central. The Bucs, after startling Los Angeles Rams, play the Bears in
 Chicago in an important NFC Central match.

Wins by the Browns and Bucs would put them in excellent positions as
 the NFL heads to the midway mark of its schedule. Losses would just make
 their respective divisions more interesting.

The Grid Line, after a week of picks it would prefer to forget, says
 this weekend of play will shape up like this.

Cleveland (4-0) at Houston (3-1): The key is whether the Oiler defence
 will pressure Brian Sipe, who is No.1 in passing in the AFC with 1,002
 yards. If it does, the Browns will lose. Lyle Alzado and Greg Pruitt are
 ailing and the Oilers are always tough at home Houston.

Pittsburgh (4-0) at Philadelphia (3-1): The Steelers are riding a
 13-game winning streak and are leading the league in defence. However,
 they have been hit with a number of injuries. The Eagles can be
 dangerous, but not enough to defeat the Steelers - second-stringers or
 not. Pittsburgh.

Miami (4-0) at New York Jets (1-3): The Dolphins should have no
 trouble winning this one. Their defence has been superb, allowing only 45
 points, while the Jets' defence has been abominable, allowing an NFL high
 of 137 points. Miami.

San Francisco (0-4) at San Diego (3-1): The Chargers will be anxious
 to make amends for their first loss of the season last week. That's bad
 news for the 49ers, who can score but can't stop others from scoring
 more. San Diego.

St. Louis (1-3) at Los Angeles (2-2): The Rams offence has been in
 neutral, scoring 15 points less than the defence has allowed. Fumbles
 destroyed the Cardinals last week. It won't happen again but the Ram
 defence is strong enough to keep them at bay. Los Angeles.

Denver (3-1) at Oakland (1-3): The Broncos defence is not the force it
 once was and the offence isn't either, but Denver has not dropped in
 calibre as much as the Raiders, who are off to a terrible start. This
 won't be the game in which they turn it around. Denver.

Washington (3-1) at Atlanta (2-2): The Redskins have won their past
 three, but against inferior competition. The Falcons have had a tougher
 schedule and need this one to stay in the race for first in the NFC West.
 They also are at home, which should mean something. Atlanta.

Cincinnati (0-4) at Dallas (3-1): This one could be a landslide. The
 Cincinnati defence has been atrocious and the Cowboys, after being
 humiliated by Cleveland Monday night, will use the Bengals to unleash
 their frustrations. Pity the Bengals. Dallas.

Kansas City (2-2) at Seattle (1-3): The Chiefs defence has been superb
 to date, but the offence has been listless. In contrast, the Seahawk
 offence has been scoring points but the defence has been weak. Offence
 will win over defence in this one. Seattle.

Minnesota (2-2) at Detroit (1-3): The Lions, with rookie quarterback
 Jeff Komlo, will have trouble moving the ball against the Vikings, and
 Minnesota has a little too much offence for Detroit to handle. Minnesota.
 (Best bet against the spread).

Buffalo (2-2) at Baltimore ((0-4): The way the Bills have been playing
 they could be 4-0. Without Bert Jones, the Colts have had little or no
 offence. There's no reason  why that should change this week. Ted
 Marchibroda, the Colts' head coach, could lose his job if they lose
 again. Buffalo.

New York Giants (0-4) at New Orleans (1-3): The Saints are due for a
 big win. They lead the NFC in total offence and against the Giants, the
 defence should finally look as impressive. New Orleans.

Tampa Bay (4-0) at Chicago (2-2): The Bucs defence has been the reason
 they are undefeated. Quarterback Doug Williams has been having a poor
 season, completing only 34 percent of his passes. That should improve
 tomorrow and the Bucs have that intangeable called momentum on their
 side. Tampa Bay.

New England (3-1) at Green Bay (1-3): This one is a mismatch. The
 Patriots simply have too much talent for the Packers. New England will
 make it a long night for Green Bay. New England.

Record: 39-17.

No-huddle hysteria hits Big East Conference

BYLINE: Jerry DiPaola

LENGTH: 674 words


Big East football continues to fight for respect, but critics might be hard
pressed to suggest the conference offers boring football ? at least if Pitt,
West Virginia and Cincinnati have their say.

The Big East is moving into a season unlike many others in its past, with the
Panthers, Mountaineers and Bearcats preparing to run a fast-paced, no-huddle
offense under their respective coaches, Todd Graham, Dana Holgorsen and Butch
Jones.

Think basketball fast break, but on a football field.

"There are endless opportunities and possibilities with this offense," said West
Virginia receiver Brad Starks, whose team opened practice Friday. Pitt opens
camp Monday.

The no-huddle scheme tests the offensive players' acumen and cardiovascular
abilities, but it also can leave the defense at risk if it's not ready for the
next play, which often comes no more than 15 seconds after the last one.

"It's hard to practice (for the no-huddle)," said Charlie Strong, who is
entering his second year as Louisville coach after spending seven years as
Florida's defensive coordinator. The Cardinals also run an up-tempo offense,
similar to what the Gators ran under coach Urban Meyer while Strong was in
Gainesville, Fla.

Strong said the genesis of the no-huddle offense is based on snapping the
football as often as possible. If you don't waste time between plays, there's
little opportunity for coaches to implement defensive situational substitutions.

"You have to get lined up, so it's going to be so hard to match personnel,"
Strong said.

No one knows the discomfort of facing the no-huddle as well West Virginia
defensive end Bruce Irvin. He faces the Mountaineers' version every day in
practice.

"I hate it, I really do," Irvin said. "But it gets you ready."

Conditioning is key, Strong said.

He was charged with devising a scheme to slow down Oklahoma's high-powered,
no-huddle offense in the 2009 BCS Championship game.

Florida won, 24-14, but it wasn't easy.

"Our guys were just gassed because they weren't used to it," Strong said. "You
have to be conditioned."

Problem is, it's difficult to imitate the speed and athleticism of the athletes
who make such offenses work.

For instance, the week before Penn State played Michigan's hurry-up scheme last
season, Nittany Lions coaches assembled two scout-team offenses on the field at
practice ? one to run the play and another to be ready to instantly run another.

It didn't work. Michigan quarterback Denard Robinson led the Wolverines to 423
yards of offense and 31 points. Penn State won, only because they scored 41
points.

South Florida coach Skip Holtz has directed an offense that used some no-huddle,
and he has competed against the scheme in Conference USA when he was at East
Carolina and Graham and Holgorsen were at Tulsa and Houston, respectively.

"They are referred to as the same," Holtz said of his coaching adversaries, "but
they are really very different. Dana probably throws more, much more drop-back
passing, and Todd probably gives a lot more wrinkles in that offense. But still
they come at you at the same pace."

South Florida has an added burden in preparing for the no-huddle this season: It
plays Pitt in its Big East opener Sept. 29, with only four days to prepare.

"I think that's something we are going to need to work on at camp, so we have
little bit of taste for it," Holtz said.

Meanwhile, the question arises: "Do you win championships with high-powered
offenses or great defenses?" Holtz asked. "What makes this league so good is the
quality of defenses that are in it."

After years of the Pitt employing a traditional pro-style offense under former
coach Dave Wannstedt, athletic director Steve Pederson hired Graham, in part,
because he believed the energetic offense would put fans ? and top recruits ? in
the seats at Heinz Field.

"Certainly, (Graham) has played great defense, but in this day and age, you also
have to be able to score some points," Pederson said. "If you are relying on
your defense to hold them to seven points, it's going to be a tough year."

NFL offences head west to chase '49ers success

SOURCE: THE HARTFORD COURANT

BYLINE: By Dom Amore

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. D11

LENGTH: 483 words


First, let's deal with the name.

"Frankly, I'm getting a little tired of hearing the term 'West Coast Offence,' "
Green Bay Packers coach Mike Holmgren said. "It started as the '49ers Offence,'
and everyone who has coached under Bill Walsh at one time or another has ...
well, why can't we call it 'The Packers Offence?' ... Oh, I'm just kidding.
Bernie Kosar, I guess, started calling it the West Coast Offence. He's pretty
smart, so maybe we should leave it."

Whatever the title, "it's a short passing game, a controlled passing game," said
Holmgren, a former 49ers offensive coordinator. And nearly everyone in the NFL
wants a piece of it nowadays. The object, presented most simply, is to send out
more receivers and find one open underneath the coverage for a high-percentage
pass. Gain 5 or 6 yards, stay inbounds, and control the clock the way you could
with a running game.

"The most important thing in this offence," 49ers quarterback Steve Young said,
"and I learned from watching Joe (Montana) run it, is never pass up an open
receiver. Even if he's only 2 or 3 yards downfield, don't pass him up. Take the
positive gain and move on."

When the defence creeps up to take away the short game, you throw long.

Even the New York Giants, as far philosophically and geographically as you can
be from the West Coast, have added a few of its plays to coach Dan Reeves'
run-dominated offence.

"It makes sense," Giants quarterback Dave Brown said. "The downside is wind and
rain and snow."

But as Lombardi Trophies pile up at 49ers headquarters -- they have five -- more
and more teams, regardless of their home climate, are hiring former San
Francisco coaches and installing the offence perfected by Walsh and Montana.

The Philadelphia Eagles, Denver Broncos, Los Angeles Raiders and Kansas City
Chiefs run the West Coast most strictly. The Minnesota Vikings and Tampa Bay
Buccaneers incorporate a lot of it. The Dallas Cowboys, Washington Redskins and
Chicago Bears, though they run more, feature many of the same elements -- such
as three-step drops by the quarterbacks and quick, slant-in routes by receivers.

Running the 49er offence doesn't make you the 49ers, however. They have
collected a group of veteran linemen in the 280-pound range who are adept at
finesse blocking. Those types are hard to find in this age of 320-pound
drive-blockers, which is why the 49ers hold on to center Bart Oates, 36, and
guard Jesse Sapolu, 34. And it's no coincidence that offensive line coach Bobb
McKittrick is one of the few assistants to remain through their five
championship seasons.

The 49ers, though, have changed the offence. "When Joe Montana ran it," left
tackle Harris Barton said, "it was like a symphony. With Steve Young, it's a jam
session. Both are great music."

No other quarterback combines running and passing skills like Young, and none
has Jerry Rice to throw to.

Washington high court rules 'Blakely' doesn't apply to consecutive sentences

BYLINE: Lawyers Weekly USA

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 379  words


This article was originally published in Lawyers Weekly USA, a sister
publication.

A defendant's Sixth Amendment rights were not violated when a judge rather than
a jury decided factors underlying the imposition of consecutive sentences for
his attempted murder convictions, the Washington Supreme Court has ruled.

A jury convicted the defendant of three counts of attempted murder. The
convictions involved the defendant firing a gun at three rival gang members. He
wounded two of the victims.

State law requires judges to impose consecutive sentences when a defendant is
convicted of two or more "serious violent offenses" that arise from "separate
and distinct criminal conduct." The trial judge in this case imposed consecutive
sentences after concluding that, because there were separate victims, the
defendant's offenses arose from separate and distinct criminal conduct.

The defendant argued that his Sixth Amendment rights were violated under the
U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Blakely vs. Washington (124 S.Ct. 2531) because
a judge rather than a jury decided facts leading to the imposition of
consecutive sentences.

But the court disagreed.

"While it is true that the imposition of consecutive sentences increases a
defendant's aggregate term of imprisonment, it is significant that in Blakely
the court was not concerned with consecutive sentences. Indeed, the court
considered the sentence on an additional count irrelevant. It seems clear from
Blakely that so long as the sentence for any single offense does not exceed the
statutory maximum for that offense, as is the case here, Blakely is satisfied.
Additionally, we note that consecutive sentences increase a defendant's total
sentence because he or she was convicted of multiple serious violent offenses,
not because the sentence exceeded the statutory maximum for any single offense.
A defendant has no right to serve concurrent sentences for committing multiple
serious violent offenses," the court said.

It noted similar decisions from the 2nd, 3rd, 5th and 9th Circuits as well as
from state courts in Alaska, California, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa,
Kansas, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Hampshire and Tennessee.

Bruins lose offensive coordinator;
Cable fulfills a dream by taking a job with the NFL's Atlanta Falcons.

BYLINE: By ROBERT KUWADA , The Orange County Register

SECTION: SPORTS

LENGTH: 525 words

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES


Offensive coordinator Tom Cable has accepted a job as offensive line coach with
the Atlanta Falcons, the fourth and perhaps the most impactful coaching change
at UCLA since the end of the Bruins' most successful season in eight years.

``It's tough to replace a coach like Coach Cable, but I guess that's what
happens when you get 10 wins ... people want your coaches,'' quarterback Ben
Olson said.

With Cable working with the offensive line and coordinating the offense the past
two years, the Bruins' offense went from dysfunctional to dynamic.

In 2003, Coach Karl Dorrell's first season, an offense coordinated by Steve
Axman struggled with communication problems and was ranked only 110th in the
nation in total offense with 294.2 yards per game.

But the next season, under Cable, the Bruins' jumped to 28th in total offense
(410 yards per game) and 29th in scoring (30.1 points per game). And last
season, in a 10-2 season that ended with a victory over Northwestern in the Sun
Bowl, the Bruins were 23rd in the nation in total offense (431 yards per game)
and fifth in scoring (39.1 points per game).

Dorrell, who fired defensive coordinator Larry Kerr and has had to replace
running backs coach Eric Bieniemy, tight ends coach Jon Embree and now Cable,
said that the priority would be to hire an offensive line coach with the next
coordinator likely coming from the staff.

UCLA also is expected to announce that defensive line coach Thurmond Moore will
not return.

Dorrell already has hired former Washington Redskins secondary coach DeWayne
Walker to be the defensive coordinator and on Thursday hired former Western
Michigan linebackers coach and Chicago Bears assistant Chuck Bullough to coach
the Bruins' linebackers.

Receivers coach Dino Babers moved to running backs to replace Bieniemy, who is
now the running backs coach with the Minnesota Vikings. And safeties coach Brian
Schneider moved to tight ends to replace Embree, who has accepted a position
with the Kansas City Chiefs.

``I know I have some capable guys on my staff,'' Dorrell said. ``... But I think
the key point is getting the right fit for us from an offensive line standpoint.
And if we can find the right fit there, in terms of understanding the things we
do, then we move from there. But we have some capable (coordinator)
candidates.''

Quarterbacks coach Jim Svoboda would be the top candidate on staff. He spent 10
years as the coordinator/quarterbacks coach at Northwest Missouri State, winning
Division II national championships in 1998 and '99 with high-scoring offensive
units.

Babers also has been an offensive coordinator at Arizona and Texas A&M.

Cable, who also had a successful stint as the line coach at Cal, said the move
to Atlanta was an opportunity that he could not pass up.

``This has been my dream,'' he said. ``I'm looking forward to getting back there
and getting to work. There's a guy there by the name of Alex Gibbs, who is
probably the best line coach in football in a long time, so I think the
opportunity to be around him and learn from him, the fact that the Falcons got
to the NFC championship game last year, it makes it all a bonus.''

A Test for Ravens' Offense;
Keeping Defense Off Field Against Manning Is Key

BYLINE: Camille Powell, Washington Post Staff Writer

SECTION: Sports; D01

LENGTH: 774 words

DATELINE: OWINGS MILLS, Md. Dec. 17


On Sunday night, all eyes will be on Indianapolis Colts quarterback Peyton
Manning's pursuit of Dan Marino's single-season touchdown record and the
Baltimore Ravens' attempts to slow him and the NFL's most explosive offense. But
the play of Baltimore's offense could be just as important as that of its
defense.

Indianapolis (10-3) averages a league-high 34.9 points per game, a figure that
the Ravens (8-5) have surpassed once this year. Baltimore's offense needs to
avoid making mistakes and wasting possessions.

"We have to match their ability to score frequently with time on the clock,"
Ravens guard Edwin Mulitalo said. "We can't just go three and out. We do want
touchdowns, but if we can eat up six minutes for a field goal, that's huge.
Obviously, we want the seven points. But we need to keep their offense off of
the field and keep our defense fresh, and the only way we're going to do that is
by staying on the field."

Baltimore had one of its most productive offensive games in Sunday's win over
the New York Giants; the Ravens scored a season-high 37 points, amassed 353
yards of total offense, and controlled the ball for 39 minutes 41 seconds. Late
in the game, however, Baltimore Coach Brian Billick thought that the offense was
getting sloppy, so he gathered the players on the sideline and yelled at them,
despite the comfortable margin. He wanted them to have a sense of
accountability, particularly considering what they have to face over the final
three weeks of the season. After the Colts on Sunday, the Ravens play the
Steelers in Pittsburgh on Dec. 26 before ending the season at home against the
Dolphins.

The Indianapolis defense, long an afterthought compared to its high-octane
offense, is opportunistic. Defensive ends Dwight Freeney (13) and Robert Mathis
(10.5) are first and third in the NFL in sacks. The Colts lead the league in
take-aways, with 16 interceptions and 17 fumbles, and their offense can turn
mistakes into points quickly.

"You don't want to give them a short field," quarterback Kyle Boller said. "You
don't want them on the field, period."

Said Mulitalo, "This is one of those games where our offense has to be real
physical and try to wear them down so we can be on the field a lot."

Having running back Jamal Lewis available for his normal workload should help
the Ravens do that. Lewis carried the ball just eight times for 32 yards and
didn't play at all in the second half last Sunday as he worked his way back from
an ankle injury. He was limited in practice throughout the week and said
Thursday that his right ankle still aches and he has some difficulty making
cuts. But he also said that if the Ravens need him to carry the ball 20 to 25
times, then "that's no problem."

Lewis has had 10 carries over the past four weeks (he sat out against New
England and Cincinnati), and he hasn't rushed for more than 100 yards since Oct.
10 against the Redskins. Still, the Colts want to keep the ball out of the
bruising runner's hands.

"Hopefully, we can get ahead and take [Lewis] out of the game that way,"
Indianapolis Coach Tony Dungy said. "If he gets 30 carries, it's going to be a
tough day for us. Hopefully, we can put him in some longer yardage situations
and hopefully we can get ahead to hold him and let the circumstances hold him
under 25 carries."

So once again, the pressure will fall on Boller, who was named the AFC offensive
player of the week after throwing four touchdown passes and finishing with a
career-high passer rating of 112.3 against the Giants. Boller's role has slowly
expanded; he has thrown 30 or more passes in his past seven games after
attempting 30 or more in just two of the first 15 games of his career.

More encouraging for the Ravens has been Boller's performance in an expanded
role. He has thrown nine touchdown passes -- and three interceptions -- in the
past seven games (237 pass attempts).

Against the Colts, the Ravens need Boller to do "everything," Billick said.
"This is playoff-caliber football. We hoped the first half of the season, he
could finish off his rookie year, which he did; the second half of the season,
impact the season, which he has; going into the playoffs now, at any given
point, he has to step up and be a factor in a big win, which he is certainly
capable of doing. This is in that mode, whether it's now, or two or three weeks
from now, if we're fortunate enough to get in the playoffs."

Ravens Note: Linebacker Bart Scott (knee) is the only Raven who has been ruled
out of Sunday's game. Safety Will Demps (shoulder) and linebacker Terrell Suggs
(shoulder) were both limited in practice Friday, but both are probable.

Ravens' Offense Could Help Defense;
Keeping Manning Off the Field Is Key

BYLINE: Camille Powell, Washington Post Staff Writer

DATELINE: OWINGS MILLS, Md. Dec. 17


On Sunday night, all eyes will be on Indianapolis Colts quarterback Peyton
Manning's pursuit of Dan Marino's single-season touchdown record and the
Baltimore Ravens' attempts to slow him and the NFL's most explosive offense. But
the play of Baltimore's offense could be just as important as that of its
defense.

Indianapolis (10-3) averages a league-high 34.9 points per game, a figure that
the Ravens (8-5) have surpassed once this year. Baltimore's offense needs to
avoid making mistakes and wasting possessions.

"We have to match their ability to score frequently with time on the clock,"
Ravens guard Edwin Mulitalo said. "We can't just go three and out. We do want
touchdowns, but if we can eat up six minutes for a field goal, that's huge.
Obviously, we want the seven points. But we need to keep their offense off of
the field and keep our defense fresh, and the only way we're going to do that is
by staying on the field."

Baltimore had one of its most productive offensive games in last Sunday's win
over the New York Giants; the Ravens scored a season-high 37 points, amassed 353
yards of total offense and controlled the ball for 39 minutes 41 seconds. Late
in the game, however, Baltimore Coach Brian Billick thought that the offense was
getting sloppy, so he gathered the players on the sideline and yelled at them,
despite the comfortable margin. He wanted them to have a sense of
accountability, particularly considering what they have to face over the final
three weeks of the season. After the Colts on Sunday, the Ravens play the
Steelers in Pittsburgh on Dec. 26 before ending the season at home against the
Dolphins.

The Indianapolis defense, long an afterthought compared with its high-octane
offense, is quick to strike. Defensive ends Dwight Freeney (13) and Robert
Mathis (10.5) are first and third, respectively, in the NFL in sacks. The Colts
lead the league in take-aways, with 16 interceptions and 17 fumbles, and their
offense can turn mistakes into points quickly.

"You don't want to give them a short field," quarterback Kyle Boller said. "You
don't want them on the field, period."

Said Mulitalo: "This is one of those games where our offense has to be real
physical and try to wear them down so we can be on the field a lot."

Having running back Jamal Lewis available for his normal workload should help
the Ravens do that. Lewis carried the ball just eight times for 32 yards and
didn't play at all in the second half last Sunday as he worked his way back from
an ankle injury. He was limited in practice throughout the week and said
Thursday that his right ankle still aches and he has some difficulty making
cuts. But he also said that if the Ravens need him to carry the ball 20 to 25
times, then "that's no problem."

Lewis has had 10 carries over the past four weeks (he sat out against New
England and Cincinnati), and he hasn't rushed for more than 100 yards since Oct.
10 against the Redskins. Still, the Colts want to keep the ball out of the
bruising runner's hands.

"Hopefully, we can get ahead and take [Lewis] out of the game that way,"
Indianapolis Coach Tony Dungy said. "If he gets 30 carries, it's going to be a
tough day for us. Hopefully, we can put him in some longer yardage situations
and hopefully we can get ahead to hold him and let the circumstances hold him
under 25 carries."

So once again, the pressure will fall on Boller, who was named the AFC offensive
player of the week after throwing four touchdown passes and finishing with a
career-high passer rating of 112.3 against the Giants. Boller's role has slowly
expanded; he has thrown 30 or more passes in his past seven games after
attempting 30 or more in just two of the first 15 games of his career.

More encouraging for the Ravens has been Boller's performance in an expanded
role. He has thrown nine touchdown passes -- and three interceptions -- in the
past seven games (237 pass attempts).

Against the Colts, the Ravens need Boller to do "everything," Billick said.
"This is playoff-caliber football. We hoped the first half of the season, he
could finish off his rookie year, which he did; the second half of the season,
impact the season, which he has; going into the playoffs now, at any given
point, he has to step up and be a factor in a big win, which he is certainly
capable of doing. This is in that mode, whether it's now, or two or three weeks
from now, if we're fortunate enough to get in the playoffs."

Ravens Note: Linebacker Bart Scott (knee) is the only Raven who has been ruled
out of Sunday's game. Safety Will Demps (shoulder) and linebacker Terrell Suggs
(shoulder) were both limited in practice Friday, but both are probable. . . .

Manning has thrown for 46 touchdowns and needs two to tie Marino's mark.

2 CENTS

LET UF OFFENSE BE AGGRESSIVE

Florida coach Will Muschamp always protects his defense.

He does this by going ultra conservative on offense.

Here's the problem: History says Muschamp defenses don't need to be protected.

Going back to his days as a defensive coordinator, Muschamp consistently has
produced top-10 defenses nationally. Each of his defenses at UF finished the
season ranked in the nation's top 10 in total defense.

The one he has this season in Gainesville might be his best. The Gators are
third in the country in total defense (208.5 yards per game), despite playing
two talented offenses in Toledo and Miami.

The Gators have a defense good enough to survive being put in tough situations.

UF turned the ball over six times last season against Georgia. The Bulldogs
scored 17 points. Miami scored 21 points two weeks ago, despite getting five
turnovers. The Gators lost both those games, but they were wins for the defense.

Florida's offense plays afraid, and that stems from Muschamp. It certainly
doesn't come from offensive coordinator Brent Pease, who lit up opposing
defenses at Boise State. The offense isn't afraid of the competition. It's
afraid of making a mistake. So it tends to make them in bunches.

Muschamp is an elite defensive coach. However, as he evolves as a head coach, he
has to let his offense have fun and be aggressive.

Saturday's game against Tennessee would be a good start. The Vols are clearly
vulnerable after allowing Oregon to score 59 points in the first three quarters
in last Saturday's 59-14 loss.

For UF to take the next leap toward winning a title, Muschamp has to take his
hands off his offense's neck.

Muschamp has built an incredible defense, which looks stacked for years to come.
It doesn't need to be protected. It needs a creative, home-run hitting offense
that can score in the 30s more often than it doesn't.

Most importantly, UF's defense needs an offense that doesn't play scared.

HAYS, THE MAGNIFICENTLY INACCURATE

Do you believe in unlikelihoods? Yes, your humble seer managed an undefeated
week at 4-0-1 (Louisville-Kentucky pushed). The season mark is now 9-5-1. This
week's slate of games is weak, but hopefully these picks won't be. Picks are
against the point spread, but for entertainment purposes only.

- Boise State (plus 3 points) at Fresno State: You can rarely get Boise State
and points unless they're playing a heavyweight, so I'll bite. The Broncos have
had success against Fresno State star quarterback Derek Carr. Plus, I'm in
Seattle and need something interesting to watch Friday night.

- Tennessee (plus 17) at Florida: This line jumped two points, but I'm still
taking the Gators. UF has had two weeks to prepare and get healthy. The Vols
might not score 10 points against this defense in such a harsh environment. Oh,
and did you see what Oregon did to Tennessee?

- Utah State (plus 6.5) at USC: The recruiting snob is picking this game.
There's no way Utah State has near the talent the Trojans have on their roster.
USC looked better against Boston College, so I'll take the Trojans to cover.

- Auburn (plus 17.5) at LSU: This line moved so much (3 points) it changed my
pick. I like what Gus Malzahn is doing at Auburn, and he inherited some talent.
Give me Auburn and the points. LSU might be looking to next week's game at
Georgia.

- Kansas State (plus 4.5) at Texas: I love the Wildcats here, who have beaten
Texas the last three seasons. I have a feeling I'll be picking against the
Longhorns a bunch this season. BYU and Ole Miss outscored Texas 84-44 the last
two weeks.

High-speed collision

BYLINE: Eric Prisbell

The indefinite suspensions of two of Maryland's top three wide receivers cast a
new light on the team's highly anticipated matchup with 18th-ranked West
Virginia, a rivalry game expected to showcase two dynamic, innovative offenses.

It remains to be seen whether Maryland's up-tempo, no-huddle offense can keep
pace with the Mountaineers' equally fast-paced offense without senior wide
receivers Ronnie Tyler and Quintin McCree, a tandem that combined for 13
receptions and one touchdown in a season-opening victory over Miami.

Tyler was arrested early Thursday morning and charged with second-degree assault
after allegedly punching a 33-year-old man in the face outside a 7-Eleven near
campus, a university police spokesman said. McCree was present at the scene, the
spokesman said, but was not involved in the altercation.

Maryland Coach Randy Edsall announced the suspensions Thursday night, leaving
his offense with just three wide receivers - Kevin Dorsey, Kerry Boykins and
Tony Logan -  who have caught a pass in college.

As is typically the case during game weeks, players and coaches were not
available Friday to discuss how the suspensions will affect Saturday's game at
Byrd Stadium. But during the week, players and coaches from both teams said that
the opposing offense mirrors their own explosive attack in style and philosophy.

Maryland quarterback Danny O'Brien and West Virginia wide receiver Tavon Austin,
two former high school basketball players, likened their respective offenses to
relentlessly pushing the basketball.

Fast-break football, they say, has two objectives: stretch the field
horizontally and vertically to get the football to playmakers in space, and do
it while employing a dizzying tempo that makes it difficult for fatigued
defenses to find time to substitute.

West Virginia's offense is a product of first-year Coach Dana Holgorsen, who
arrived in Morgantown, W.Va., with an impressive rsum after lighting up
scoreboards as an offensive coordinator at Oklahoma State, Houston and Texas
Tech. Maryland's offense can largely be attributed to the veteran, schematic
mind of coordinator Gary Crowton, who has designed a variety of high-scoring
offenses during stops as a head coach at Louisiana Tech and Brigham Young and as
a coordinator at Oregon and Louisiana State.

"Their offensive coordinator is a mad scientist just like Coach Crowton is,"
Maryland defensive lineman A.J. Francis said. "It is going to be interesting."

The positive: Maryland's defensive players know they'll be prepared for the pace
of West Virginia's offense because they have practiced against their own offense
since the spring. The negative: They also know that West Virginia's defensive
players will be prepared for the pace of Maryland's offense because they have
practiced against their offense since the spring.

The danger: Trouble arises when these offenses go three-and-out because, after
what may be a 30-second possession, your defense is forced to retake the field
immediately.

The Mountaineers (2-0) had three three-and-outs in their first six possessions
against Norfolk State. But Holgorsen has acknowledged that there is "quite a
bit" of the offensive playbook he has yet to install.

"You can't go into a game with everything," Holgorsen said. "You'll blow your
kids' minds. You try to figure out what you can handle. It's going to be awful
hard [right away] for me to put a product out there that looks like the New
England Patriots. I have had games like that, too, but probably not in Game 2."

Asked how well his team's offense is operating on a scale of 1 to 10, Austin
said 61 / 2, adding that there is a ways to go in terms of missed blocks, missed
assignments and running precise routes. "Our tempo is still not where it's
supposed to be," Austin said. "Hopefully it will be just like playing
basketball."

While recruits and fans marveled at the tempo of Maryland's offense against
Miami, Maryland's players were also surprised, but for a different reason. They
wanted to go even faster. Crowton was yelling at them to go faster, but the ball
could not be snapped until the official spotted it.

"If we get an official to spot the ball faster, that will definitely help us
with our tempo," offensive lineman and co-captain Andrew Gonnella said. "We were
running to the ball so fast, we were waiting for them to spot it. It was like,
'Oh, man.' "

If there is one credo for the offense, O'Brien offered this: "It's, like, never
fast enough."

In a typical 10-minute practice period, Francis said, players get  30 to 40
reps. Last season, he said, they may get 15 to 20 in a similar period.

"You never really get fully used to it," Francis said. "Somebody may have to
call somebody at Oregon to ask their defense how they get used to it."

At times in practice, the first- and second-team offenses will rotate in after
each play, sometimes giving the first-team defense, which remains on the field,
only four to five seconds between snaps. As Francis described it: "It's play.
Sprint. Sprint back. Play. Sprint. Sprint back. Play. Sprint. Sprint back. It's
tough."

The question looms whether Maryland can sustain such a fast-paced offense
without two of its best wide receivers.

And West Virginia and its best playmaker, Austin, will be looking to maintain
the same pace even though Austin suffered an undisclosed finger injury in the
Norfolk State victory (he said he is close to 100 percent).

Regardless, a back-and-forth, high-scoring affair remains the expectation.

"It's not going to be a shootout," Maryland linebacker Demetrius Hartsfield
cautioned. "We're not going to let that happen."

A Myth Revisited: Defense Doesn't Always Win Titles

BYLINE: By AARON SCHATZ

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 23

LENGTH: 865 words


It is often said that defense wins championships, but a look at this year's 12
NFL playoff teams would seem to indicate that defense doesn't necessarily even
get you into the postseason. A number of teams built around defense failed to
even post winning records in 2004, including Chicago, Miami, Washington, and
Tampa Bay. The average playoff team this season ranked eighth in the league in
yards gained, but only 16th in yards allowed.

A look at the Football Outsiders' Defense-adjusted Value Over Average ratings
(DVOA), which break down each play of the season and compare it to the NFL
average based on situation and opponent, makes the offensive inclination of this
year's playoff teams even clearer. Only one of the top 10 offenses,
second-ranked Kansas City, missed the playoffs. But seven of the top 10 defenses
missed the playoffs, including the top three: Buffalo, Baltimore, and
Washington. Among playoff teams, only Pittsburgh, New England, and Denver had
defenses in the top 10, according to our play-byplay analysis.

Scoring around the league was up in 2004, thanks mostly to the new emphasis on
illegal contact rules, which led to looser pass coverage by defensive backs. To
be sure, this doesn't explain why so few strong defensive teams made this year's
playoffs - for a variety of unrelated reasons, teams like the Redskins and Bears
were sunk by major quarterback problems. But this year's slant toward offense
has allowed high-scoring teams like Philadelphia and Indianapolis to hold out
hope that they can defy the rule that defense wins championships.

Except there's no need to defy this rule: It's not true in the first place.

Fans may be forgiven for finding this difficult to believe. The idea that
defense is more important in the postseason is repeated ad nauseum by NFL
analysts once the calendar has turned to January. Recent history also seems to
support the concept: Of the past four Super Bowl champions, only the 2001
Patriots did not lead the NFL in fewest points allowed.

But this trend toward defense-oriented champions was preceded by a trend towards
offense-oriented champions. From 1991 through 1999, every Super Bowl champion
ranked either first or second in points scored during the regular season, except
for the 1995 Cowboys, who ranked third.

Since the liberalization of passing rules in 1978 (and excluding the strange
1982 strike year), a total of 16 Super Bowl winners finished in the top five in
points scored during the regular season, and a total of 18 Super Bowl winners
finished in the top five in points allowed during the regular season.

Those fairly even numbers are a good indicator that neither superior offense nor
stifling defense has an advantage when it comes to winning the Super Bowl: What
matters is balance.

Most Super Bowl champions have ranked among the league's best teams in both
offense and defense. In recent years, the difficulty of amassing talent for both
offense and defense under salary cap restrictions have made that kind of
dominance less frequent in recent years, but teams that are far better in one
area than the other still have a very hard time winning the Super Bowl.

Since 1999, the first year for which we have broken down play-by-play data to
provide DVOA statistics, no team has made it to the Super Bowl with one unit
ranked in the NFL's top 10 in DVOA and the other unit ranked in the bottom 10.
The only one that came close was the 2000 Baltimore Ravens, ranked by DVOA as
first in defense but only 20th in offense.

That could change this year, though not necessarily because of the league-wide
emphasis on offense. After all, there have been other seasons where offensive
numbers were as high as 2004, and teams with strong offenses and poor defenses
didn't fare any better than usual in those years. But given this year's diluted
NFC playoff pool, the conference may end up represented by a team with a strong
offense and a terrible defense simply because those were the teams that made the
playoffs.

Of the six NFC contenders, only Atlanta and Philadelphia have defenses that rank
in the top half of the league. The defensive units fielded by St. Louis, Green
Bay, and Minnesota rank 29th, 30th, and 31st, respectively. If one of these
teams actually does advance to the Super Bowl, the odds of it beating a more
balanced AFC opponent are tiny.

As for the Colts, play-by-play analysis shows that they are more balanced team
than their reputation would suggest. According to official NFL yardage stats,
the Colts are ranked second in offense and 29th in defense; DVOA puts the
offense where it belongs, ranked first, and the defense moves up to 18th.That's
high enough to believe that the Colts have a reasonable shot at the title.

In the end, though, the AFC champion will likely be one of two supremely
balanced squads: Pittsburgh (seventh in offense, fourth in defense) or New
England (fourth in offense, sixth in defense). When one of these teams wins
Super Bowl XXXIX, you can expect to hear the usual canard about defenses winning
championships. Of course, the winner will have depended equally on its highly
rated offense. Either offense or defense can bring home a title, but it is best
to have both.

Defense: DE Jerry Hughes (TCU), 6-3, 257: The senior specializes in big plays.
He led the country with 15 sacks last year  and forced six fumbles. A  top
running back while in high school, he has speed off the edge that makes him a
target for double-teaming.

From the top down

TCU: The defense was No. 1 last year; QB Andy Dalton is back.

Utah: The offense could have a freshman at quarterback and four other new

BYU: The offense should be no problem; a tough schedule early.

Air Force:  QB Tim Jefferson sparked the offense last year.

UNLV: A potent offense with QB Omar Clayton and WR Ryan Wolfe.

Colorado State: Inexperience at some key positions.

San Diego State: Ingredients for improvement on offense, defense.

Wyoming: Solid defense; the offense needs to improve.

In Search Of Spark, Nets Find An Offense

BYLINE: By JONATHAN ABRAMS

SECTION: Section D; Column 0; Sports Desk; Pg. 6

LENGTH: 959 words


The high school basketball practices screamed mayhem, but their efficiency
showed a soothing type of organized chaos.

Nets Coach Lawrence Frank caught wind of a California high school coach who kept
winning with his zany offense several years ago from the Fresno State assistant
John Welch, now a Denver Nuggets assistant.

''He told me: 'It doesn't matter the level. This guy is a fantastic coach,' ''
Frank said. ''Lo and behold, that guy was Vance.''

Lo and behold, Vance was Vance Wahlberg, now an assistant at Massachusetts and
the inventor of the offensive scheme that Frank is trying to incorporate into
his own this season.

At the time, Wahlberg was at Clovis West High School in Fresno, in the middle of
molding his pet project, the dribble-drive motion offense, which has since
piqued the curiosity of several N.B.A. teams. Wahlberg said the Sacramento
Kings, the Denver Nuggets and the Atlanta Hawks, among other teams, inquired
about it this off-season, while the Boston Celtics used selected sets from it
during their championship run.

Frank was among the most aggressive in learning the system, which relies on
penetration from the guard and kick-outs to the wings. His team, Frank said,
needed something new, apparently besides eight fresh faces on  the roster.

After missing the playoffs for the first time in seven years, the Nets underwent
a radical makeover. So, as they are introduced at Friday's news media day before
training camp opens on Saturday, there is playing time to be claimed. Point
guard Devin Harris and swingman Vince Carter are the only starters penciled in,
with the remaining three spots up for grabs, Frank said.

And the Nets will continue to hone  aspects of the dribble-drive motion offense,
a process that began over the summer.

Frank is quick to say he is not overhauling his offense, but trying to play to
its strengths in certain circumstances by using Harris's quickness.

''Every coach has a system, and within that system, every coach has to have a
system that's flexible enough to accommodate different things,'' Frank said.
''The beauty of it is, you're attacking with different guys with different spots
from different angles. That guy from the corner may finish at the top and vice
versa.''

Wahlberg developed the offense when Chris Hernandez, who later played for
Stanford, continually beat his defender off the dribble, only to be met by a
congested lane. To open the court, Wahlberg tried to space out his players  and
rarely called for screens.

He moved the center to the weak side, told Hernandez to penetrate and, when that
did not work, to penetrate again. The goal was for Hernandez to have a path to
the basket or for a defender coming in to block his way to leave his man open
for a kickout pass. Based on Hernandez's movements, his teammates moved as
though they were tethered together, and Hernandez always knew where to find
them.

''On the collapse, you're going to know exactly where your teammate is,'' said
Wahlberg, who recently served as Pepperdine's coach before resigning 18 games
into last season. ''If you're running a motion, you don't know where guys are
once you attack. If you have shooters, you are going to need defenders that stay
closer. If you have guys that can take it to the hoop, they can't defend them,
so the two kind of play off one another.''

Wahlberg estimates he has tutored about 800 different coaches throughout various
levels who have come to him with hands out and pencils ready, eager to learn
about the offense.

Basketball's most popular offenses -- the Princeton, the triangle and the motion
-- have been used for decades. Whether the dribble-drive motion offense shows
staying power or dissolves into a fad in the N.B.A. remains to be seen. But as
the game's players evolve, Wahlberg sees a need for its offenses to develop as
well.

''I think it's geared for the N.B.A. because there are great one-on-one
players,'' Wahlberg said. ''When you have guys that are able to get to the rack,
I think it's very effective. When you space people out, you open things up.''

He made a believer out of Memphis Coach John Calipari, who used to coach the
Nets.

Since installing the offense three seasons ago, the Memphis Tigers are 104-10
with two Round of Eight and a championship game appearance. Derrick Rose, the
point guard who was the focal point in Memphis's offense last season, was the
first selection in June's N.B.A. draft.

''It's fun to play,'' said Calipari, who said the free-wheeling offense is an
attractive recruiting draw. ''The players love it. And the fans love watching
it. People always ask me if I went to the N.B.A., would I run it? Absolutely. If
the N.B.A. takes it on, they'll make it even better.''

The offense attracted Frank's attention. He met and talked with Wahlberg
throughout the off-season and recently participated in one of Calipari's
coaching clinics.

The offense is not altogether foreign for Nets players. The rookies Brook Lopez
and Chris Douglas-Roberts are familiar with it. Lopez grew up in the area where
Wahlberg popularized it and, by then, most of the teams in the region ran it.
Douglas-Roberts played in Calipari's system at Memphis for three seasons.

Frank does not suggest that the new sets are the only things the team needs to
inject life into an offense that averaged 95.8 points a game last season, 25th
in the league.

''I think the biggest thing is offenses and defenses don't win games,'' Frank
said. He noted that a number of coaches had tried the triangle, but few outside
of Lakers Coach Phil Jackson had been successful with it.

''It's the players and the trust you have in each other'' that lead to a team's
success, Frank said. ''That's what's going to make you win.''

Utah football: Utes face Jim Mora's new and improved UCLA

BYLINE: By Lya Wodraska The Salt Lake Tribune

SECTION: SPORTS; College Sports; Utah Utes

LENGTH: 539 words


He has thrown players out of practice, he has kicked media members out of
practice and he has called his own sports information staff "incompetent." No
one is safe from Jim Mora's critical ways as the former NFL coach has rebuilt
the UCLA Bruins in his style.

It's hard to complain, however, about a few ruffled feathers based on the
results he is getting in his first year with the Bruins.

With the exception of last week's 43-17 upset at the hands of Cal in which the
team seemed to slip into last year's mediocrity, the Bruins (4-2, 1-2) have
exhibited a new attitude and style of play under Mora, whose team hosts the Utes
(2-3, 0-2) Saturday at 1 p.m.

"The personnel hasn't changed much, but they are utilizing their talent in new
ways," Utah coach Kyle Whittingham said. "The cupboard wasn't bare -- they have
athletes."

Even though he has a reputation as a defensive guru, Mora's biggest influence
has been with the offense.

UCLA's offense limped along under former coach Rick Neuheisel, who insisted on
trying to run the pistol offense.

The scheme never worked for the Bruins, who were 21-28 under Neuheisel and
averaged just 23 points a game in 2011.

But Mora has found a way to add some zing to the Bruins' offense, hiring Arizona
State's Noel Mazzone, who has opened up the offense into a more dynamic attack.

Now the Bruins are averaging 529 yards of total offense and 33.5 points.

"They look a lot like Arizona State did with a wide open attack," Whittingham
said. "It's a whole new scheme from what they were doing last year, and it's
working for them."

Of particular concern for the Utes is running back Johnathan Franklin, who leads
the Pac-12 averaging 133.3 yards a game.

Franklin was slowed by injuries to his calf and hand against Cal, when he rushed
for 103 yards on 15 carries, but the Utes have learned stopping the run against
high-powered Pac-12 teams doesn't always translate to defensive success as much
as it did in the Mountain West.

"You've seen all the big plays the quarterback and running back make," Utah
defensive coordinator Kalani Sitake said. "They have a cast of running backs who
can do it, but they can also hurt you with the bubble throws and screen throws
outside."

Utah's defense is giving up just 114.8 yards a game on the ground, but has been
susceptible to passing attacks, allowing USC's Matt Barkley to throw for 303
yards.

UCLA quarterback Brett Hundley is third in the Pac-12, averaging 315.8 yards of
total offense, although he did throw four interceptions in the loss to Cal.

However, Mora didn't put all the blame on his quarterback, saying he was
pressing after the Bruins got into a desperate situation.

"We are continuing to see him make progress," Mora said. Alt Heads:

Cincinnati's prolific offense to pose tough test for BYU

BYLINE: Jeff Call Deseret News

Deseret News

PROVO - East Carolina scored 38 points and rolled up 518 yards of total offense
against BYU last Saturday.

The Cougars won the game, 45-38, but they will take on an even more dangerous
offense Friday (6 p.m. MT, ESPN) when Cincinnati invades LaVell Edwards Stadium.

Based on sheer statistics, the Bearcats are the best offense BYU has faced this
season.

"They're throwing for almost 400 yards per game, they're rushing for almost 200
yards per game," said Cougar outside linebackers coach Kelly Poppinga. "By the
numbers, they are the best offense we've seen. They have great skill guys, great
running backs, a good offensive line, good quarterback play. They're
productive."

Fast-paced Cincinnati (3-2) is No. 5 in the nation in total offense (587.2 yards
per game), No. 5 in passing offense (385.8), No. 6 in first downs (161), No. 10
in third-down conversions (48 percent), No. 16 in scoring (39 points per game)
and No. 32 in rushing offense (201.4 yards per game).

"They've done some things to hurt themselves with turnovers and they've kicked
some field goals when they probably wanted to score touchdowns," Poppinga said.
"But they move the ball on everybody. It's a big challenge again. It will be a
very similar game as last week. Last week prepared us a lot for what we're going
to see this week. But they're a little more explosive, believe it or not."

The Cougars gave up 385 yards through the air against ECU.

"They're really skilled, a very similar opponent to what we just played," coach
Bronco Mendenhall said of the Bearcats. "Maybe even a little bit more explosive.
Similar caliber, similar type of athletes. I would compare them to Memphis, in
the bowl game we played last year. Similar styles, similar athletes,
similar-type programs. It will be a great, great college football game and a
really good test."

Cincinnati wide receiver Shaq Washington, who has caught 34 passes for 392 yards
and two touchdowns, is the top target, but the Bearcats have a stable of
talented wideouts.

Cincinnati lost at Memphis, 53-46, earlier this season and is coming off a 34-23
victory over Miami (Fla.) on Oct. 1. Its two losses - Temple and Memphis - both
have 5-0 records.

The Bearcats boast two talented quarterbacks in junior Gunner Kiel and redshirt
freshman Hayden Moore. Moore stepped in for an injured Kiel and led a
game-winning drive in a win over Miami (Ohio) on Sept. 19.

Then Kiel suffered a neck injury against Memphis on Sept. 24 and Moore came in
and threw for a school-record 557 yards in the loss. Moore engineered the
victory over Miami (Fla.)

Kiel was cleared this week to play, but coach Tommy Tuberville isn't tipping his
hand about which QB will start.

"We're looking forward to getting (Kiel) back and have he and Hayden Moore
compete against each other, and may the best man win," he said this week. "We've
told both of them that we'll look at all the week's practice. Both will get the
same amount of reps. We'll go in with the one that had the best week of
practice. And we probably won't do that until game time. ... It's good to now
know we have two quarterbacks we feel good about."

Mendenhall said Kiel and Moore are similar enough that his defense won't have to
make significant adjustments based on which QB is in the game.

BYU wide receiver Mitch Mathews said Cincinnati's defense has plenty of
athletes.

"Some of the coaches who have played them this year have told our coaches that
you'll look at them in warmups and they'll look like an NFL team - big,
athletic, they wear black. They look sharp. They look good."

BYU quarterback Tanner Mangum remembers watching the Cincinnati-Memphis game on
TV.

"They're a good team. They're athletic and fast on both sides of the ball.
That's going to push us to be athletic to match their speed and physicality,"
Mangum said. "I think that's something we've been doing well. They run a lot of
man coverage, but they like to mix things up. No matter what they do, we have to
be able to execute."

Triangle relies on several elements

BYLINE: Jeff Zillgitt

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 7C

LENGTH: 520 words


LOS ANGELES -- Once Sasha Vujacic learned Phil Jackson was returning to coach
the Los Angeles Lakers in 2005, he obtained DVDs of Jackson's Chicago Bulls and
Lakers championship teams.

He studied the triangle offense.

"I wanted to be prepared," Vujacic says. "It helped me understand more beyond
the basic triangle, to see different options. The triangle has so many options
that we can discuss for days how good and effective it is. Only thing is, you
have to have five guys who are willing to be on the same page."

There is a notion that European players seamlessly fit into the triangle offense
because of their background of refined individual skills in a team environment.

Vujacic, who scored 20 points in the Lakers' Game3 victory, is from Slovenia,
Vladimir Radmanovic is from Serbia and Pau Gasol is from Spain. Lakers star Kobe
Bryant's game has a European influence. He lived in Italy as a kid while his dad
played pro basketball.

"You are right in a lot of ways with the characterization that European players
might fit better into our offense, simply because of their shooting. Perhaps
there's a little more emphasis on shooting," Jackson says. "Our American ball, a
lot of it is interior ball, driving to the basket, penetration, one-on-one, an
individual game. A lot of their game fits well within this system, particularly
if you have post players like Gasol or a penetrator like Kobe."

A mystique surrounds the triangle offense because Jackson has won nine NBA
titles, and two all-time greats, Bryant and Michael Jordan, have been a part of
all nine.

When the triangle dazzles, it's as if Euclid had a hand in its creation. When
the offense is disrupted, as the Celtics have done by clogging the lane and
preventing penetration, it can be a geometric mess.

Jackson says Boston's defense on wing players is altering the offense. "As a
consequence, we're getting our offense at a different level and different
spacing," he says. "But our spacing hasn't been good. I said last night, it
doesn't look like we're playing Laker basketball."

The triangle, like most good man-to-man offenses, relies on player and ball
movement. But the triangle also requires outstanding shooters and specific
spacing, and the players, like a quarterback, must read the defense accurately.

"People make the triangle tough," Lakers assistant Kurt Rambis says. "It's not
tough. If you understand basketball, it's not that hard to pick up."

Gasol learned the offense quickly. "You've got to know your options, your
wrinkles," he says. "You've got to know how to respect spacing on the floor.
It's a system that encourages that, for you to space out and really have room to
operate and cut, and if they take away something, there's a next option."

While Tex Winter, a basketball consultant for the Lakers and the guru of the
triangle, encourages  high school coaches to teach the offense, its NBA future
is uncertain.

"It's a very difficult offense because it requires a considerable amount of time
in breakdown drills to get execution," Jackson says. "A lot of coaches don't
have the time because defense takes so much time in this game, also."

Offense ranks among elite worst ever

BYLINE: By Steve Corkran, MEDIANEWS STAFF

SECTION: SAN MATEO; Raiders; Sports

LENGTH: 697 words


EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- It wasn't exactly 1977 Tampa Bay Buccaneers bad, but
the Raiders offense secured its place among the most inept in league history
with its three-point outburst against the New York Jets on Sunday.

The Raiders finished with a league-worst 168 points in 16 games (10.5 average),
which also was a team record. The previous low was 213 points in a 14-game
season in 1962, a 15.2 average.

Only 138 of this year's points came via offense. Given that, the Raiders' 8.6
offensive points per game ranks as the seventh-worst leaguewide since they began
play in 1960. The '77 Buccaneers (5.4 avg.) set the benchmark, with the '74
Atlanta Falcons (6.9) the only other team under 7 points per game.

"We've got to catch up to the defense," running back Zack Crockett said. "We
know the areas where we need to get better at. Now it's time to just do it."

The Raiders offense finished last in the league in points per game, total
offense, passing offense, sacks allowed and several other pertinent statistical
categories.

Coach Art Shell replaced offensive coordinator Tom Walsh with John Shoop after
11 games. The Raiders moved the ball better under Shoop but scored at an even
worse clip.

The Raiders averaged 11 points under Walsh's guidance, 7.2 under Shoop's
stewardship.

Against the Jets, the Raiders once again were beset by turnovers. Three drives
ended with turnovers. Two others came via failed attempts to convert fourth-down
plays.

WE'RE NO. 1: The Raiders gained a measure of satisfaction from their season of
despair by winding up with the rights to the top pick in the NFL draft in April.

They entered the game tied with the Detroit Lions recordwise in the dreaded
chase for the No. 1 pick. However, the Lions held a considerable edge in the
tiebreaking procedure in case the teams wound up with identical records.

That turned into a moot point with the Raiders losing and the Lions beating the
Dallas Cowboys 39-31.

"I didn't know Detroit wanted to give that up," defensive tackle Warren Sapp
said, with a hearty laugh.

The Raiders have been in this position only once before in their 47-year
history. They selected quarterback Roman Gabriel at No. 1 overall in the 1962
American Football League draft, but he opted to play for the Los Angeles Rams in
the NFL instead of with the Raiders in the AFL.

OVERTURNED CARR: Second-year kick returner Chris Carr has bemoaned his inability
to take back a kick all the way. He has been "one block away" numerous times
this season.

On Sunday, he came 1-yard shy of scoring his first touchdown on a kick return.
Yet, he didn't get to enjoy his near-miss for very long. Jarrod Cooper got
called for holding on the third-quarter return. The infraction negated Carr's
92-yard return and gave the Raiders the ball at their 18-yard line.

"When it happened, I couldn't believe it," Carr said. "I said if I break a big
one, I'm probably No. 1 in the NFL. ... The whole season has been thoroughly
frustrating."

For the record, Cooper said he got beat by the player he was accused of holding
and his efforts had nothing to do with springing Carr into the open field.

ROAD KILL: The Raiders lost for the eighth straight time away from the Coliseum
this season. That extended their streak to 11 consecutive road losses and marked
the second time in four seasons (2003) they failed to win any away games.

EXTRA POINTS: Raiders wide receiver Johnnie Morant had his most productive game
as a pro. He caught three passes for 24 yards. However, he fumbled at the end of
his first reception. He also fumbled at the end of his final reception in
Oakland's previous game, against the Kansas City Chiefs on Dec. 23. ... Sapp
notched his 10th sack in the first quarter. He reached double digits in sacks
for the fourth time in his 12-year career and the first since he posted a
career-high 16 in 2000 for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Sapp finished one behind
team-leader Derrick Burgess. ... The Raiders committed three more turnovers and
finished with 46 in 16 games. Their takeaway-giveaway differential was a
league-worst minus-23. ... Raiders receiver Randy Moss (ankle) and cornerback
Tyrone Poole were among the eight players deactivated for Sunday's game.

Bulls' Tex Winter the real superstar in triangle offense

BYLINE: David DuPree

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 7C

DATELINE: CHICAGO


CHICAGO -- When Chicago Bulls assistant coach Tex Winter had his
book on the triple post offense first published in 1962, he got
a letter from a Kansas rancher requesting his help.

"He wanted me to send him a copy because a triple post fence
was just the innovation he was looking for to help him with his
herd," Winter says.

Winter couldn't help the rancher much, but he certainly has had
a hand in making the Bulls the most feared team in basketball
and a heavy favorite to win their fourth NBA championship. They
lead the Seattle SuperSonics 1-0 in the best-of-seven NBA Finals
which resume Friday at United Center.


Chicago's triple post, or sideline triangle offense, is the most
complicated, yet effective halfcourt offense in the NBA, and it
isn't a coincidence the Bulls are the only team in the league
that utilizes it as their main offense. Winter, 73, has been perfecting
it for 50 years.

"It's the way we teach it, not what we're teaching," he says.
"You can't copy it because you can't teach something you don't
completely understand."

And when it comes to the triangle offense, Winter did indeed,
write the book.

It all goes back to 1946 when Winter was playing for Southern
California under coach Sam Barry, along with future NBA greats
as players and later coaches, Bill Sharman and Alex Hannum. They
played what was called a center opposite offense, and Winter took
its basic principles and made his own innovations, and the sideline
triangle was born.

"I did an awful lot of experimenting and it has evolved over
the years," he says.

"Because of it, we don't call a lot of plays," he adds. "We
key off the ball, but we have special things we can incorporate
into the offense. It gives us stability and consistency."

It also utilizes Michael Jordan's skills perfectly because it
keeps everyone else involved when he has the ball. "We space,
but we don't isolate," Winter says.

The Bulls get into the triangle offense about 60% of the time.

The advantages are countless.

"It's actually triangles all over the floor and theoretically
any five players can be at any spot," says Bulls assistant John
Paxson, who won three NBA championships with the Bulls executing
the offense. "Everything starts with the pass to the post. We
talk in terms of penetration and a pass to the post is penetration.
We have a variety of cuts off it and it is all dictated by how
the defense plays. That's what's difficult about defending this
offense. If you defend it one way, we have a counter."

Winter says the triangle is predicated on the seven principles
of sound offensive basketball.

-- Penetration.

-- Spacing (everyone is 15-20-feet apart, but in scoring position).

-- Movement of the ball and the players, with a purpose.

-- Good rebounding position and defensive balance on all shots.

-- It's a five-man concept with options to pass to any of the
other four players.

-- The offense counters the defense.

-- It utilizes the individual talents of the players.

"Teams that defend it well are the teams that make it difficult
for us to get into the offense," Paxson says. "The Knicks, and
for years Detroit, defended it well because they'd put pressure
on us and grab on to us and not let us run and make cuts. That's
when having great offensive players like Michael and Scottie (Pippen)
shows.

"When Phil took the job and allowed Tex to implement it, we were
all coming into it new together," adds Paxson, who got many open
jump shots by running it properly. "Doug Collins was the coach
before and he had his own sets, so we all started this thing together
and it grew over the years with us. It takes unselfishness and
guys willing to move the ball and have faith in it."

Malzahn juggling duties, preparing to 'go out with bang'

BYLINE: Charles Bennett, The Anniston Star, Ala.

Dec. 30--ATLANTA -- Gus Malzahn is a busy man these days, serving as Auburn's
offensive coordinator as the Tigers prepare for Saturday's Chick-fil-A Bowl game
with Virginia and making preparations to take over as Arkansas State's head
coach after the bowl.

"The good thing is that we had the game plan in before we made the trip here,"
Malzahn said. "I've been focusing on Auburn in the morning as far as getting
ready for practice and coming back after practice and grading it. In the
evening, I've been thinking about Arkansas State as far as hiring the staff and
as far as recruiting. It's been busy, but it's a very exciting time for me."

While his duties may be divided, those around him at Auburn say Virginia's going
to get Malzahn's best shot come Saturday.

"He's going to throw the book at them, and really kind of let all of his
playbook out," said Auburn tight end Philip Lutzenkirchen. "We'll use a bunch of
different formations, a bunch of different sets and a bunch of guys playing.
We're not holding anything back."

When Malzahn's spread offense is operating at peak efficiency, it's formidable.
In three seasons at Auburn, Malzahn's offenses have broken nearly every school
single-season record of importance.

And before coming to Auburn, Malzahn's offenses at Tulsa led the nation in total
offense in both 2007 and 2008.

Auburn's offense has sputtered for the better part of this season largely
because of inexperience at key positions, including quarterback, and injuries to
key personnel.

After leading the SEC in scoring offense and total offense en route to an
unbeaten season and the BCS title in 2010, Auburn slipped to ninth in scoring
and 10th in total offense while finishing 7-5.

However, during the time since Auburn's 42-14 thrashing at the hands of Alabama
on Nov. 14, the players believe the Tigers' offense has been resurrected.

Although practices have been closed to the media and the public, indications are
that Malzahn has returned to emphasizing the fast pace that he prefers and
execution has been sharp.

"Yeah, we're ready to send him out right," said Auburn wide receiver Quindarious
Carr. "This offense is going to go out with a bang."

Malzahn is a little more cautious, but he says that's the plan.

"I definitely want to go out on a high note," he said. "We could be more
aggressive as far as the play-calling goes. I'm really excited, really want to
give these guys the best chance to win."

Auburn coach Gene Chizik says Malzahn has handled his split duties very
professionally.

"He's been very focused when it's time to focus on Auburn and us being able to
be very competitive in the game," Chizik said. "I think he's done a tremendous
job. It's hard to balance the two, there's no question. He's trying to put
together a staff, he's trying to recruit, yet he's trying to win his last game
for Auburn."

Malzahn wouldn't have it any other way.

"I was just thankful that coach Chizik gave me the opportunity to finish this
thing right and to coach these guys throughout the bowl season," Malzahn said.
"And I was thankful that Arkansas State gave me the opportunity to do both. It
is a very challenging thing to do, but I think you always got to think about
what is best for the kids and what is best for the players."

And among those players, Malzahn will be missed.

"I'm definitely going to miss coach Malzahn," said Auburn wide receiver Emory
Blake. "He recruited me. He told me everything that we'd do and we accomplished
that. He told me that a lot of people would know who I am and that we'd win the
national championship. Everything he promised me, we accomplished."

Rockets' offense taking off after slow start

BYLINE: Ryan Autullo, The Blade, Toledo, Ohio

SECTION: SPORTS

LENGTH: 588 words


Nov. 14--Listless showings in the Florida and Missouri games threatened to
define the 2013 University of Toledo offense.

Instead, two other games did.

Line up the best defenses the Mid-American Conference has to offer and the
Rockets are liable to mow them down, which they've done twice now in must-have
late-season games.

A star-studded cast with designs in the preseason of taking an eraser to the
program record book has been on an incremental uptick, coalescing in a merciless
stomping of the MAC's second-ranked defense in Tuesday's 51-41 win over Buffalo.

The evening played out much like the Bowling Green contest from last month when
the Rockets ambushed their rival for three quick touchdowns to go up 21-0. BG
entered that day with the conference's top-ranked defense, a perch it has not
relinquished and likely won't considering the damage Toledo inflicted Tuesday on
the Falcons' closest competition.

"I think our offense took a lot of hits early in the season, but last time I
checked Missouri's really good, and Florida's really good on defense," Toledo
coach Matt Campbell said after his offense posted 300-plus rushing yards for the
fourth time in five contests. "Sometimes people don't understand what those guys
are going against. It's hard offensively to be in rhythm early in the season.
You always naturally get better offensively as the season grows. Hopefully
people are appreciative of the offense and what those guys have done here
because it's pretty impressive."

Toledo, winners of five in a row, needed Northern Illinois to beat Ball State on
Wednesday in DeKalb, Ill., to continue its trek toward the MAC title game. A
Ball State win will have eliminated the Rockets.

Take away losses in the first two weeks to Southeastern Conference members
Florida (24-6) and Missouri (38-23) and Toledo is averaging 40 points per game.
Point totals in those seven games include 55, 51, 47, 45, and 38.

Escaping slumps in that time are two seniors captains. Quarterback Terrance
Owens had five touchdown passes and six interceptions in the first seven games.
He has eight TDs and zero picks in three games since. His favorite target,
Bernard Reedy, caught five of his six TD receptions in the past five games. Two
of them came Tuesday on deep post routes for gains of 59 and 56 yards.

"We feel if we can catch the safety sitting flat-footed we can get it," said
Reedy, who needs 264 more yards to reach 1,000 for the second straight year.

Tuesday's 551-yard, six-TD performance stands perhaps as Toledo's top offensive
performance in the 23 games under coordinator Jason Candle. The Rockets scored
TDs on four of their first five series and never ran into trouble against
linebacker Khalil Mack, the likely MAC defensive player of the year.

Buffalo, which bid farewell to a win streak that grew to seven, had been
surrendering 20.7 points and 363.9 yards.

"We have a great offensive coaching staff," Campbell said before heaping praise
on Candle, running backs coach Louis Ayeni, line coach Tom Manning, and
quarterbacks coach Scott Isphording. "I think we're really blessed to have the
guys that are coaching on the offensive side of the ball."

All of those coaches minus Manning were around in 2011 when Eric Page, Adonis
Thomas, and Campbell as coordinator helped author the greatest offensive season
in Toledo history, averaging 42.2 points.

PRO FOOTBALL;
He's Not Montana, But Style Is Familiar

BYLINE: By MIKE FREEMAN

SECTION: Section B;   Page 23;   Column 1;   Sports Desk

LENGTH: 703 words

DATELINE: EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J., Sept. 6


It seems as though almost every team in the National Football League runs the
West Coast offense. Only the San Francisco 49ers run it the way it should be
run. They originated it and have the big-time players to make it purr like a
sports car.

Patriots Coach Bill Parcells once described the West Coast offense as basketball
played on grass. If that's the case, Joe Montana was Magic Johnson and Jerry
Rice is Michael Jordan.

When the Giants try to rebound from their embarrassing loss to the Cowboys
against the Chiefs in Kansas City on Sunday, they will face that West Coast
offense. And while the quarterback running it is not Montana, it is a player who
knows the offense well because he ran it behind Montana when both players were
with the 49ers. Steve Bono is no Montana, but he's as close a copy as you can
get without yanking Montana out of the studio at NBC, where he is now a football
analyst.

"You would think when they lose Montana that their offense might drop off some,
but Bono has played extremely well," said Coach Dan Reeves. "They threw the ball
an awful lot during the preseason so you get a good look at what he can do, and
he's really thrown the ball well."

Bono, 33, is an 11-year veteran who hasn't seen much playing time. He spent five
seasons in San Francisco behind Montana and Steve Young, both of whom only
happen to be two of the highest-rated quarterbacks of all time. After going 5-1
as a starter with the Niners, he joined the Chiefs in 1994 in a trade and served
as Montana's backup. Now Bono is the starter, and he led the Chiefs to a 34-10
blowout of Seattle last Sunday.

"I've waited a long time to get to this point," said Bono. "I feel good about
it."

Bono throws and play-action fakes as well as Montana. They sometimes look like
carbon copies of each other -- except Montana will go into the Hall of Fame and
Bono won't. In Week I, though, Bono had the Chiefs' offense clicking. He is the
league's highest-rated quarterback with a 156.6 rating, a 78.3 completion
average and 12.09 average per-play gain.

That is a concern for the Giants. It is a difficult offense to defend: It is all
timing patterns, with passes going to many receivers thrown out of many
formations. It's a speed-oriented system designed to slowly pick apart a defense
then break it down with a long pass play.

It goes something like this: Short pass to a receiver, short pass to a running
back, short pass to a tight end. They complete those again and again, and just
when a defender bites on the short stuff they run a stop-and-go and throw deep.
Actually, this version of the offense goes deep a little more than the offense
Bono ran in San Francisco. "Watch the 49ers," said linebacker Corey Miller.
"It's basically the same offense."

Bono has spoken to Montana since he retired and joined NBC. They talk about
football, but their conversations are more about everyday life. Montana doesn't
give him pointers about football and Bono doesn't tell him how to work the
Telestrator. The Giants are hoping that Bono only plays like Bono and not like
vintage Montana.



EXTRA POINTS

Receiver MIKE SHERRARD is questionable with sore ribs. . . . If the Giants
remember anything from their loss to Dallas it should be this: EMMITT SMITH and
MICHAEL IRVIN were signing autographs for Cowboys fans on the sideline once the
game had got out of hand. . . . Wide receiver THOMAS LEWIS remained upbeat even
though he will miss at least six weeks because of a broken foot. This injury
follows a knee injury that forced him to miss much of the season last year. "I
know I'm going to get better and I know I'll be back before the season is over
so I'm more optimistic this time around," he said. Lewis injured the foot on
Monday night when a Cowboy fell on it. Lewis actually was in for one more play
before pain forced him to leave. He will have surgery on the foot on Thursday. .
. . The Lions cut the third-string quarterback, GINO TORRETTA, and signed KENT
GRAHAM. . . . Giants safety TITO WOOTEN may see some playing time this week. . .
. Wide receiver CHRIS CALLOWAY has a 26-game reception streak. . . . The Giants
will travel 23,178 miles this season, eighth most in the league.

Meyer's offense on the move

BYLINE: ANTONYA ENGLISH; GREG AUMAN

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 1C

LENGTH: 814 words


Florida coach Urban Meyer arrived in Gainesville Tuesday with a reputation for
one of the most innovative and complicated offenses in college football. And
while there isn't an exact replica anywhere but at Utah, bits and pieces can be
found in a number of places, including the NFL.

"You could compare it to St. Louis or Indianapolis, how they spread the field,"
said Josh Harris, who played quarterback under Meyer at Bowling Green and is now
a rookie with the Baltimore Ravens. "Generally, it's three wideouts, one back,
one tight end. You can have four or five wideouts, but we also would keep the
running back in and throw there as well."

"He's a combination of all kinds of offenses," said USF defensive coordinator
Rick Kravitz. "There's a little bit of BYU in there, a little of Tennessee. It's
like he took the best parts of what everybody was doing and said "Let me put
this in, let me add this wrinkle.' "

In the collegiate game, it's comparable to several, including West Virginia,
South Carolina and Northwestern. But opponents and analysts agree no one makes
it more complicated and tougher to defend than Meyer.

"It's basically an offense that spreads the field, tries to create space and
then looks to run and pass," ESPN analyst Chris Fowler said. "Option is the big
component of it; they'll run some different looking option plays. They'll have
option out of the shotgun or inside option where a flanker or a slot guy comes
in motion like a shovel pass underneath. And also, they throw the ball a whole
lot. It's very balanced and it's been very, very hard to defend."

Kravitz can attest to that. The Bulls defeated Bowling Green and Meyer 29-7 on
Nov. 16, 2002.

It is the most lopsided loss in Meyer's four years as a head coach.But it wasn't
easy.

"It was a nightmare," Kravitz said of the offense. "They had everything. All
kinds of formations, motions and adjustments. It was a great offense."

It's an offense that has been tagged with nicknames such as controlled chaos,
fastbreak on grass, basketball on turf. It relies on finesse, fakes and trick
plays. Former UNLV coach John Robinson called it "an option offense with a good
passer or a passing offense with an option running quarterback."

Meyer calls it too much praise about nothing.

"There is no offense," he said. "The offense is molded around the personnel we
have. I think that is something we do better than anybody. The offense at
Bowling Green with Josh Harris was significantly different than the offense for
(Utah quarterback) Alex Smith because they are different players. It's an
adaptable offense, and it has to be."

What you can't call it is Fun 'n' Gun.

Meyer has acknowledged he wants to bring the swagger back to Gainesville, but it
won't be in Steve Spurrier's style.

"It isn't a Spurrier offense at all, they have very different principles,"
Fowler said. "But you also have the same kind of production Steve had, they just
achieve it a little bit differently. They will run the ball quite a bit."

In leading Utah to an 11-0 regular season, Meyer focused on balance. The Utes
ranked No. 3 nationally in total offense (502.73 yards per game) and scoring
(46.27). Utah averaged 244.91 yards rushing and 257.82 yards passing this
season, nearly a perfect balance.

"The difference is that Urban and his group do a little bit more with the
running game than they do with the passing game, so it's a balanced offense,"
ESPN's Lee Corso said. "There's more balance to it. But remember Steve Spurrier
was in a class by himself when it came to offense. Urban Meyer has a good
offense, but not in relationship to Steve Spurrier. What Spurrier did he did
five to six years in advance of everybody else, so you can't compare anybody
with him."

How Meyer will conform his offense to Florida quarterback Chris Leak and his
receivers remains to be seen. In two seasons with the Gators, Leak has run very
little option, isn't blessed with brilliant speed and is more of a dropback
passer. And in Meyer's system, the quarterback is clearly the key.

"The quarterback has to make good decisions, to be efficient with the ball,"
Harris said. "Coach Meyer and his staff, they put a lot on their quarterback. It
takes a lot to read the defense and manage the game. It takes a smart guy,
because you make quick decisions."

Colorado State coach Sonny Lubick admits that much of Meyer's success at Utah
was due to the fact that most teams couldn't figure out a  way to defend his
offensive schemes. But in the SEC, Meyer will have to adjust to a league where
teams possess defensive speed that doesn't allow a team to survive on the
option.

If history is any indication, Meyer most likely will just come up with new ways
to be successful.

"He does a great job of adjusting with his personnel," Corso said. "I think
they'll be very, very happy with him the University of Florida."

Holgorsen names QB coach to complete coaching staff

BYLINE: FROM STAFF REPORTS

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. P3B

LENGTH: 408 words


MORGANTOWN - West Virginia University football Coach Dana Holgorsen has
announced that his coaching staff is now complete with Jake Spavital being named
the Mountaineers' quarterbacks coach for the 2011 season.

Spavital, who joined the WVU football staff in January as the offensive graduate
assistant coach, worked with the quarterbacks during the spring and will
continue in that same role. Vincent Cashdollar will return to the field this
season as the offensive graduate assistant.

"When I became the head coach in June, I promised the players that the coaching
staff and their responsibilities would remain the same," Holgorsen said. "Jake
coached the quarterbacks during the spring and this was a natural progression
for our staff. He has worked with me for the past two years and has a bright and
promising future in coaching."

Spavital served as the graduate assistant at Oklahoma State on Holgorsen's
offensive staff in 2010. The Cowboys led the nation in total offense during the
regular season and finished No. 2 in passing offense and No. 3 in total and
scoring offense. Oklahoma State averaged 520.23 yards per game in total offense,
including 345.9 passing yards and 44.23 points per game.

The Cowboys won a school-record 10 wins during the regular season and won the
Valero Alamo Bowl. Quarterback Brandon Weeden passed for more than 3,000 yards
and became the first Oklahoma State passer to earn first team all-Big 12 honors
and was a finalist for the Manning Award, given to the top quarterback in the
nation.

In 2009, Spavital assisted Holgorsen at Houston with a variety of duties on the
offensive side of the ball. The Cougars finished No. 1 nationally in total
offense (563.4), passing offense (433.7) and scoring offense (42.2).

Quarterback Case Keenum led the nation in total offense, totaling 416.4 yards
per game. He also ranked among the Top 10 nationally in pass efficiency.

Spavital came to Houston after spending the 2008 season at Tulsa. He was a vital
part of the No. 1 ranked offense and a team that finished a school-record 11-4
and defeated Ball State in the GMAC Bowl.

A four-year letterwinner at Missouri State, Spavital was a quarterback for the
Bears from 2004-07, and graduated in 2008 with a bachelor's degree in business.

A native of Tulsa, Okla., Spavital played quarterback and defensive back at
Union High School. He was selected the 6A-4 Player of the Year in 2003, and
played in the 2004 Texas vs. Oklahoma Oil Bowl.

Triple-option serves service academies

BYLINE: by JOHN HARRIS

LENGTH: 268 words


Despite the federal government shutdown, the Department of Defense approved
Saturday's football games involving the service academies: Air Force-Navy in
Annapolis, Md., and Army-Boston College in Chestnut Hill, Mass.

Army, Navy and Air Force feature unique offenses based on their utilization of
the triple-option to help lessen the talent disparity. Here's a closer look at
those games: Army ranks No. 2 nationally in rushing, averaging 325.4 yards per
game and 5.4 yards per carry. Army leads the nation with 299 rushing attempts.
Conversely, Army has attempted only 57 passes, third fewest overall, and are
123rd (last) in passing offense.

Navy is No. 6 in rushing, averaging 301 yards per game and 5.4 yards per carry.
The Midshipmen have rushed 165 times and are No. 116 in passing offense while
attempting the fewest passes in the country (37 ).

Air Force ranks No. 8 in rushing, averaging 296 yards per game and 5.4 yards per
carry. Air Force is second nationally behind Army with 273 rushes. Air Force
ranks No. 120 in passing offense and its 70 passes are the sixth fewest in the
country. Believe it or not, Air Force is passing more than last year when it ran
nearly six times as many rushing plays as passing plays and didn't throw once in
a win over Hawaii.

West Virginia enters Saturday's game at No. 17 Baylor ranked No. 57 in passing
offense. In his first two years, WVU coach Dana Holgorsen's passing offenses
ranked No. 10 and No. 6. Prior to WVU, Holgorsen's passing offenses at Oklahoma
State, Houston and Texas Tech finished among the top three each year from
2005-10.

Buffs hope to reduce errors

BYLINE: By Tom Kensler, and John Henderson, Denver Post Sports Writers

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. D-08

LENGTH: 661 words


BOULDER - Even insiders don't quite know what to expect from Colorado's offense
Saturday night. But one thing's certain: The offense will be simplified in an
effort to cut down on turnovers.

Turnovers cost CU dearly in 1997. The Buffaloes placed seventh in the Big 12
Conference and 60th nationally in turnover margin with minus-1. For the season,
CU had 27 giveaways (fumbles or interceptions) compared with 26 takeaways.

"We're simplifying the offense so we have plays we know we can go to," senior
wide receiver Darrin Chiaverini said. "You've got to know who you can go to. If
it's third down and 1, third down and 2, and you don't have those plays, then
you've got problems. You're looking for somebody to make those plays, try this,
try that, and all of a sudden you're losing 21-7 if things aren't working.

"You definitely need to simplify your offense and stick to it."

A smaller playbook doesn't mean an offense has to be more predictable,
Chiaverini said.

"We're doing a lot of different stuff this year. Our offense is simplified, but
there are a lot of wrinkles in it," Chiaverini said. "We know what we're doing,
and we're going to be rock-solid doing it. But the defense might think things
look different because of the wrinkles."

A less complicated offense also could take some pressure off Mike Moschetti,
CU's quarterback who will be playing in his first major-college game.

"Simplifying the offense should cut down on turnovers because it helps the
quarterback know what his reads are," Chiaverini said. "That helps Mike and
helps us be more of a cohesive unit. We're looking forward to showing everybody
what kind of offense we've got."  CU on blue-chipper's list Cory Redding, a
6-foot-5, 235-pound senior linebacker at Houston's North Shore High School, told
USA Today he is considering CU. Redding is rated among the nation's top
prospects. Two of Redding's former North Shore teammates, wideout Cedric Cormier
and center Andre Gurode, are CU redshirt freshmen. Redding also listed Texas,
Nebraska, Florida State, Texas A&M and Arizona, where his brother, 6-4,
350-pound Chris Redding, is a freshman offensive guard.  Travel plans Although
Mile High Stadium isn't more than 25 miles from Boulder, CU is treating Saturday
night's game as a road trip. The Buffaloes will spend Friday night at a hotel in
Denver and will go through a walk-through Saturday afternoon.  Reinhardt captain
Ed Reinhardt, who nearly died after a collision at Oregon in 1984 while playing
tight end for Colorado, will be the honorary captain for the game. Reinhardt has
slowly recovered from emergency brain surgery and a coma to walk and speak. He
speaks throughout the state with his father on a program titled, "You're OK,
kid." One more way in The game's a sellout, but two tickets each will be given
away to the best Buffaloes and Rams outfit at Friday's noon pep rally in Larimer
Square. The schools' mascots, Chip and Cam, will pick the winners and give them
the tickets.

Colorado has sold out its home games against Texas Tech and Kansas State. The
Kansas State game, however, has a waiting list. Tickets for the game at Nebraska
are also gone.  Moschetti: Hitting is harder Moschetti has never played before
76,078 people and a national television audience. The most he has played before
is 10,000 in a Class-A Midwest League game in Michigan. But he has faced a
tougher task than the one facing him in Colorado State. In fact, his teammates
ask him all the time if football is harder than baseball.

"I tell them hitting a baseball is the toughest thing to do in sports,"
Moschetti said. "It's just like they say, there's nothing in the sport that's
tougher than hitting a fastball thrown 90 miles per hour. Football is more
demanding physically but as a quarterback you have the ball in your hands. It's
up to you to do something with it. You feel like you have some control over what
happens. In baseball, the ball is coming at you."

Big 12's power point demo;
It has nation's best offenses

BYLINE: Kelly Whiteside

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 1C

LENGTH: 360 words


The conferences formerly known as the Big Eight and Southwest were once home to
the wishbone, power-I and veer offenses. In the Big 12, a merger of those
leagues, an amazing makeover has taken place. With spread passing attacks and
no-huddle offenses, the conference is piling up points at a dizzying rate.

"The most phenomenal thing is now to see 50 points in this league, nobody is
surprised," Texas coach Mack Brown says. "At one time you said, 'God, they
scored 58!' Now (coaches) are pulling (starters) out to keep it to 58."

The Big 12 has five of the top six scoring offenses in the nation. Four Big 12
teams are among the nation's top six in total offense and four are among the
nation's top six in passing offense.

The Southeastern Conference might be considered the deepest power league, but
the Big 12, with six teams in the USA TODAY Coaches' Poll, is gaining ground (or
air). Still, USA TODAY's Jeff Sagarin rates it third in his computer behind the
SEC and Big Ten.

The offensive shift in the Big 12 came when more teams began to use spread
offenses. "People can use lesser linemen so they can get by with lesser depth,"
Brown says. "And it's kind of like a basketball analogy if you get the point
guard at quarterback who's very accurate and he can run, you spread everyone
out. Then all of sudden you find three little guys who can fly and put them at
wide receiver and you can take a smaller back who's really fast and put him in
the backfield and take big splits. You move it to a lot of different people if
the triggerman is hot."

The league also has veteran Heisman Trophy-contending quarterbacks, with
Missouri's Chase Daniel, Oklahoma's Sam Bradford and Texas' Colt McCoy getting
the most attention. The QBs are especially efficient, too. Four rank in the top
five nationally in passing efficiency: Bradford, Oklahoma State's Zac Robinson,
McCoy and Daniel. The aerial assaults of those four will be on display Saturday
when No.1 Oklahoma faces No.5 Texas in Dallas and No.2 Missouri hosts No.17
Oklahoma State.

The flip side to a league full of so many accurate gunslingers? "Now we're all
just trying to figure out how to stop 'em," Brown says.

Williams likes big-play potential of Lions' offense

BYLINE: By Ray Parrillo; Inquirer Staff Writer

SECTION: SPORTS; P-com Spt. Eagles; Pg. E08

LENGTH: 667 words


Sure, Roy Williams says, the West Coast offense, with all its dink-and-dunk
passes and short crossing routes, has won championships for San Francisco, Green
Bay and Tampa Bay, and it helped get the Eagles to the Super Bowl in 2005.

But if you're employed to catch footballs, and you're as tall and fast and
skilled as Williams, you prefer to gain yards in large chunks rather than inch
your way down the field. That's why Detroit's Pro Bowl receiver seems to be
having the time of his life playing in the fastbreak offense designed by Lions
offensive coordinator Mike Martz.

"The West Coast offense is for guys who like to get the little 5- and 10-yard
routes and run after the catch and get tackled and all that stuff," said
Williams, who will play in Philadelphia for the first time Sunday when the Lions
face the Eagles at Lincoln Financial Field. "But here I might catch the ball 20
yards down the field on the run, you know, so it's a nice offense to be in. I
think every receiver in the NFL who's had the opportunity to play in this
offense feels the same."

Martz's offense is receiver friendly as well as entertaining. He was the
offensive coordinator for the St. Louis Rams when they won Super Bowl XXXIV.

Last season, Martz's first as Detroit's offensive coordinator, the 25-year-old
Williams emerged as one of the NFL's top receivers. He led the NFC with 1,310
yards receiving and averaged 16.0 yards a catch, tops among receivers with at
least 65 catches. He also led the NFL with 24 catches of 20 or more yards. The
2004 first-round pick (No. 7 overall) from Texas also was named to the Pro Bowl
for the first time.

In his first two seasons, Williams played under Steve Mariucci, one of many
coaches beholden to the West Coast offense. So he has a basis for comparison.

"It's a big difference," he said. Martz "is a guy who wants to go deep. He's a
guy who wants to get the ball to the receivers quickly when you want to blitz.
He just wants the big plays, fastbreak the ball up and down the field all day
long."

The 6-foot-3 Williams, who had seven catches in a 20-17 overtime win against
Minnesota, believes the Lions did not fully grasp Martz's offense until the
final game last season, when Detroit knocked off playoff-bound Dallas, 39-31, to
end a seven-game losing streak.

Now the Lions are going for their first 3-0 start since 1980 after defeating the
Raiders and Vikings, and Williams thinks the team's stable of talented receivers
creates matchup problems for any defense - as long as quarterback Jon Kitna has
time to throw.

With Eagles cornerback Lito Sheppard likely to miss his second game with a knee
injury and safety Brian Dawkins banged up, Williams and talented rookie Calvin
Johnson could have big days.

"Any of our four wides can be the stars on the field," Williams said. "The
defense has to bring in the third or fourth corner who can't start at the one or
two corner spots. It creates a disadvantage for the defense."

Williams said second-year coach Rod Marinelli has instilled confidence in a team
that has not made the playoffs since 1999. Kitna predicted before the season
that the Lions would win 10 games and make the playoffs.

"Jon's not the only guy," Williams said. "Coach Marinelli has changed the
mind-set of this football team from being losers to having confidence in what we
do. So that 10-win thing comes from Coach Marinelli and Coach Martz. . . .

"This team is for real, man."

Kevin Jones' status. Marinelli offered hope that Kevin Jones could play against
the Eagles.

The former Cardinal O'Hara High star has not played since Dec. 10 because of a
foot injury that required off-season surgery.

"We're hoping, but we'll see as this week goes on," Marinelli said. "He's been
practicing the last two weeks in pads, and he's had days when he's been up and
down. . . . It's a weird injury. Hopefully we'll get him going, practice him
hard, and see how he does Friday in terms of the recovery."

PRO FOOTBALL;
Sherrard Rips Reeves For 'Big Ten' Offense

BYLINE: By MIKE FREEMAN

SECTION: Section B;  Page 23;  Column 5;  Sports Desk

LENGTH: 610 words

DATELINE: EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J., Oct. 9


His words may offer the keenest insight into how the Giants' offense is run and
what has been wrong with it. And to some -- particularly to Coach Dan Reeves --
they will be stinging.

Mike Sherrard, the former Giant and current Denver wide receiver, said today he
knows why the Giants' offense has ranked near the bottom of the league the last
three seasons.

Echoing sentiments that some former Giants have felt and current players are
afraid to say publicly, Sherrard said in an interview that Giants offensive
assistant coaches have little input in the offense and that players have even
less say and that leads to disaster. Sherrard also feels the Giants' offense
suffers because Reeves does not make adjustments, and when things go wrong he
blames the players, not himself.

"You really can't blame it on anyone else because he's there for every meeting
and coaching every position on offense," Sherrard said. "Dan is real
conservative and he likes to run the ball a lot. The one thing I don't think Dan
or the Giants' offense does is make adjustments. Last year we had a lot of games
at halftime that were close or we were winning and we made no adjustments at
halftime and we'd end up losing the game. You've got to make adjustments. Here
we make adjustments.

"Dan is not going to do that. His theory is: 'If the play doesn't work, it
doesn't work because you guys aren't executing it. It's not working because I
didn't call the right play.' "

Sherrard, who stays in contact with some former teammates and watches some of
their games, said the Giants' offense is like "Big 10 football. Because you have
to run the ball so much so the focus isn't on developing a passing attack,
developing schemes and all that."

Reeves, who was in meetings tonight, could not be reached for comment.

Sherrard played with the Giants from 1993 until last year. In 1994, he led the
team in receiving with 53 catches for 825 yards and 6 touchdowns. Sherrard has
been reluctant to share his opinions about the Giants' offensive problems but
talked about them this week after being asked to compare Reeves and Broncos
Coach Mike Shanahan.

The Giants' offense was ranked 10th over all in 1993 but has slid each
successive season. In 1994 it was 28th and was 29th in 1995, as it is this
season. The Giants were ranked dead last in passing last year and are last this
year. In rushing the Giants were ranked No. 1 in 1993, then 10th in 1994, 13th
in 1995 and are now 18th.

The Giants have won the last two games by scoring 13 points against the Jets and
15 points versus Minnesota. Reeves has tried to be more flexible with his
players but it is no secret that he and quarterback Dave Brown have had
conflicts.

In Reeves's defense, the Broncos have John Elway, a future Hall of Famer. But
Sherrard's point is that the tight approach he says Reeves takes takes its toll
on the players' confidence.

"We have the potential to score 35, 40 maybe 50 points," Sherrard explained.
"With Dan's offense we knew it was going to be close no matter who we were
playing or what the situation was. In the fourth quarter we were trying to be
close. Here we're trying to blow people out.

"You don't want to go into the game thinking it's going to be close because
we're going to have them hanging around. You want that killer instinct, that
ability to go for the jugular."

Charley Walters: Gophers QB Adam Weber has had plenty of variety in his offenses

BYLINE: Pioneer Press

Gophers quarterback Adam Weber holds several school passing records and is on
his way to becoming Minnesota's all-time passing yardage leader. Considering
that the junior from Mounds View has had to learn three different offenses under
three different coordinators, that's not bad.

The first offense Weber had to learn under co-coordinators Mitch Browning and
Tony Peterson emphasized the run.

Then the Gophers hired Mike Dunbar, who ran a spread offense, a scheme Weber had
never seen.

This season, the Gophers hired Jedd Fisch as offensive coordinator with an
emphasis on the run.

That might make a lesser guy dizzy. Weber sees it as a positive.

"I look at it as a great opportunity, for myself to be knowledgeable in all
types of offenses," he said Tuesday. "Obviously, it's easy to sit back and say I
wish I would have had four seasons of one offense. But I haven't been given that
opportunity, and now it's all about taking what's been given and try to go as
far as you can with it."

Maybe next year, Weber will get a chance to run the same offense two seasons in
a row.

"That would be nice," he said.

The Gophers have football recruiting visits planned for three Texas preps this
weekend: defensive lineman Joey Searcy and offensive lineman Josh Allen of
Dallas, and defensive back Allen Veazie of Houston. Also visiting are offensive
lineman Josh Campion of Fergus Falls, Minn., and running back Donnell Kirkwood
of Delray Beach, Fla.

The Timberwolves open their 21st season tonight against the New Jersey Nets at
Target Center.

"This is probably the start of our rebuilding to where we're going to be in a
couple of years," CEO Rob Moor said.

Moor projects the Wolves to have sold nearly 2,000 new season tickets -- full
and combination -- by mid-November. He says he remains patient.

"Absolutely, you've got to build it back up," he said. "It's a rebuild process.
All teams cycle. Unfortunately, this has taken a little longer than we had
hoped.

"When we traded Kevin Garnett, we felt it would be a three-year rebuild, and
this is the third year. And we're in sort of another renewal, so it's a little
longer than we had hoped. But we've got tremendous energy going now, so I'm not
going to complain. I'm happy with where we are."

Moor said president of basketball operations David Kahn has absolute authority
to build the Wolves.

"We hired an expert to let the expert do what he's going to do," Moor said. "My
job is to enable him as much as possible; when he needs something, we'll just go
out and see how we can get it done."

Moor said the Wolves are providing Kahn with the financial resources to be
successful.

"In this day and age, we're trying to run fiscally responsibly," he said. "But
one thing you can say about (owner) Glen Taylor -- he has never been stingy when
somebody comes to him and says, 'We'd like to get this player.' He has never
held back."

Moor's expectations this season?

"I'm expecting to have fun," he said. "We're going to be building; these are
young guys, they have to learn (coach Kurt Rambis') new system, so I don't
expect us to be winning a tremendous amount of games. We're going to win more
than we won last year."

The Wolves won 24 games last season.

"But I expect every game to be fun, and I expect to see our guys start to
develop their identity, the type of team we're going to be," Moor said.

Open seats were hard to find for Gophers men's basketball coach Tubby Smith's
Golden Dunkers booster club welcome Tuesday night at Williams Arena.

Ex-Gophers running back Gary Russell started the past two games for the Oakland
Raiders, catching seven passes for 55 yards in a 13-9 victory over the
Philadelphia Eagles in Week 6.

Cretin-Derham Hall's Mark Alt, who might be the top quarterback in the state but
who has been out with a cracked collarbone for three weeks, required his
doctor's permission before resuming practice this week.

Bob Klas Jr. has been named this year's Mr. Golf of Minnesota by Southview
Country Club's Diehard committee.

There's still hope: St. Paul's Herb Mischke recently shot an even-par 72, a
record for an 81-year-old golfer at Midland Hills Country Club. The national
record for an 81-year-old is believed to be 67.

DON'T PRINT THAT

Look for Gophers senior wide receiver Eric Decker to have surgery soon on his
left foot.

The Vancouver Canucks, who have tried to sign first-round draft pick Jordan
Schroeder, were at Mariucci Arena last weekend to scout the Gophers' star
sophomore against Denver.

Last year, a Target Center suite for 20 people for a Timberwolves game brought
$3,500 at a charity auction. Last weekend at a charity auction, the same deal
brought $900.

Notre Dame and Purdue recently committed to play each other in football through
2021, but the Gophers still haven't been able to get on the Irish's schedule.
"Not yet; we're plugging away, though," Notre Dame grad Joel Maturi, the
Gophers' athletic director, said Tuesday.

OVERHEARD

Gophers football coach Tim Brewster, on getting to play at night on Saturday
against Michigan State instead of 11 a.m.: "I love night games for the fans, the
team, the environment. But if the games were at 3 a.m., I'd be there and I'd be
excited."

Abortion, crime laws in effect for N.C., Fla.

BYLINE: Compiled by Chris Burritt and Ron Taylor

SECTION: NATIONAL NEWS, Pg. 10G

LENGTH: 486 words



New laws take effect today in North Carolina and Florida.
In North Carolina:

-A new "parental consent" law requires girls younger than 16 who want abortions
to have permission forms signed by their parents or legal guardians.

-A domestic violence law allows judges to order an abusive spouse to surrender
firearms or to not purchase firearms for a set period.

In Florida, new laws will:
-Require inmates to serve at least 85 percent of their sentences.

-Impose mandatory prison terms for those convicted of a fourth violent offense
who already have served one stint in prison.

-Increase penalties for dozens of offenses and make it more likely home burglars
and auto thieves will do prison time.

The crime-fighting measures in Florida are projected to cost up to $ 1.9 billion
by the end of the decade.

WILD KITTIES UNLEASHED: Officials in Myrtle Beach, S.C., have decided to attack
the growing menace of small "cotton" rats the natural way - with stray cats.
Instead of euthanizing cats caught by animal control officers, the city will
vaccinate them, spay and neuter them and give them away to people with rat
problems.

BLUE SUEDE GENERAL: What did Elvis Presley and Union Gen. Ulysses S. Grant have
in common? Until now, nothing. But Elvis Presley Enterprises, the company that
manages Graceland, has agreed to try to turn the Hunt- Phelan Home, Memphis'
oldest house and the place where Grant planned the attack on Vicksburg, Miss.,
into a tourist attraction. The company, created by Jack Soden, took over
Graceland in 1982, and the house now draws more than 700,000 visitors a year.

PIGS, PIETY: The flames of the eternal Southern barbecue debate will be fanned
in the coming weeks when PBS stations around the region broadcast "Slow Food:
Fast Times." The 'cue-docu by Boone filmmaker Joe Murphy premiered Saturday in
North Carolina and will be available to PBS stations in other states Oct. 29.
(It probably will air in Georgia in December.) In the film, barbecue lovers talk
about the joy, the thrill, the utter spiritual experience of barbecue:

"Mustard seed is mentioned in the Bible; all the Old Testament sacrifices were
cooked with wood, and that was ordained by God. If you ask me who was the
original barbecuer, I'd say it was God himself."

Maurice Bessinger, owner of the Piggie Park, Columbia, S.C.-

"I don't think it is quite a religious experience, but it is an experience,
especially when it starts running down both sides of your chin and dripping in
your lap."

The Rev. Frank Graham, son of evangelist Billy Graham, Boone, N.C.

"When you are cooking and the conditions are right, you can almost tell when it
is going to snow."

Kent Bridges, Alston Bridges Barbecue, Shelby, N.C.

"There's no doubt that eating this pig is not good for my body, but it might be
good for my soul."

Jeff Goodman, a member of Murphy's film crew.

WVU Sports;
Defense may run at faster rate also

BYLINE: Mike Casazza

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. P1B

LENGTH: 821 words


MORGANTOWN - As difficult as it was for Jeff Casteel's defense to be as good as
it was last season with an offense that frequently put the defense in bad
situations, West Virginia's defensive coordinator knows it will be harder to
replicate that success in the 2011 season.

Oh, he'll try. He might even pull it off, given his resume that was last updated
to include a defense that was No. 3 overall last season, No. 3 in points allowed
and No. 2 against the run.

Yet having to replace seven starters is about as easy as it sounds.

Supporting an offense that is going to play with a tenacious tempo and try to
ring up touchdowns and first downs at an alarming rate is far more demanding.

"Our challenge will be to play a good, solid defense around that," Casteel said,
"and if go and look at the numbers on the other side of the ball with some of
the high-tempo offenses, usually ..."

He trailed off, but the point was clear. Elite offenses are oftentimes
exclusive.

Of the 20 best - or is it worst? - in time of possession last year, only one
team had a top 20 defense (Syracuse, No. 7).

That group included Oklahoma State and Houston, where Holgorsen recently worked
as the offensive coordinator (2010 at OSU and 2008 and '09 at UH), and where he
left an influence those teams still follow today.

Texas Tech is in there, too, and while those Red Raiders are not the ones who
gained fame with Holgorsen and former Coach Mike Leach, it's still a fast-paced
spread offense.

Of last season's top 20 in scoring offense, which again included Oklahoma State
(No. 3) and Houston (No. 14) and barely excluded Texas Tech (No. 23), only four
had to top-20 defenses - Boise State, Nos. 2 and 2; TCU, Nos. 4 and 1;
Wisconsin, Nos. 5 and 20 and Ohio State, Nos. 11 and 3.

And remember, Boise State and TCU played in non-BCS leagues and Wisconsin and
Ohio State are not tempo teams.

Offenses that play fast can score fast or punt fast or turn it over fast, too.
Whatever the outcome, the quicker the offense moves the sooner it's off the
field and the defense is back on it.

"We're going to have to make sure we're able to get off the field on third down
and able to create turnovers to get off the field," Casteel said, knowing full
well his defense was tremendous on third down last year, but quite the opposite
in creating turnovers.

Ever the grounded realist, Casteel is "as happy as you can be after three
practices in the spring," but also aware of what Holgorsen's offense is going to
try to do and what that might mean for his defense.

"They really spread the ball around and they're going to get rid of it quickly,"
he said. "I think the thing that's going to be difficult is once they're able to
start controlling the down and distance situations, you better get off the
field.

"When you have to go play eight, 10, 11 snaps that quick, that's where they're
going to start gaining an advantage because kids start to make mistakes on
defense."

Casteel is pretty familiar with that and likens Holgorsen's offense to parts of
the two he's seen precede it at WVU. It's a shotgun offense and does some things
Jeff Mullen did the previous three years, but it's playing with the pace former
Coach Rich Rodriguez riddled teams with before him.

However, Casteel is working with a number of new and young players who are being
tested physically and mentally every time the offense lines up to snap the ball.

No one has seen anything much like this - the tempo, the tight end out in space
every down, the other nuances - and Casteel is watching his players pretty much
operate on their own out on the field.

"I think once we start to see a normal tempo offense, whether that's in
September or whenever, the guys are liable to get bored between plays," Casteel
said.

These Mountaineers do a lot on offense during practice and Holgorsen wants to
cram as much football into the available practice time as possible. There's not
much of a gap between a whistle that ends one play and the silent count that
begins the next. The defense has to ready itself fast and make sure it's not
making any mistakes of mind or body.

For now, that's actually a good problem and gives Casteel a pretty clear look at
who can handle himself best on defense, and under duress.

"It's a tough situation in terms of having to communicate," the WVU defensive
coordinator said. "A lot of them are still trying to learn what's going on and
they're doing a pretty good job with that because what we're trying to coach and
teach right now is maybe different than what they're seeing when they get into
team situations and skeleton drills.

"We're just trying to get them to understand the front and coverage and pressure
and execute that even though that's maybe not the best call against what they're
seeing. We're not matching up anything right now. We just want to see the kids
play."

In the Talent-Rich SEC, the Spread's Influence Grows

BYLINE: By RAY GLIER

SECTION: Section B; Column 0; Sports Desk; Pg. 15

LENGTH: 878 words


It was an October evening in 2005, and the spread-option offense that Coach
Urban Meyer had installed in his first season at Florida looked overmatched in
the rock-'em, sock-'em Southeastern Conference. The Alabama Crimson Tide had
mauled the Gators, 31-3, and Meyer could have been forgiven for wondering if his
playbook was headed for a yard sale table.

''I was very concerned,'' he said recently. ''I started believing what I was
hearing'' -- that the spread offense would not work in the SEC.

The marketplace, needless to say, has changed. Florida has won two national
championships in the past three seasons and it led the SEC in scoring and total
offense last season. Pages on the spread offense are now incorporated into
playbooks all around the conference.

Spread offense hysteria has not completely replaced the rugged culture of the
SEC, as it has in the Big 12. Most SEC teams still use a tight end, a fullback
and massive tackles to open holes for a 215-pound running back. But there have
been adjustments, including fewer tight ends and fullbacks on rosters, and
smaller, quicker defensive backs who can stick with receivers better in the open
field.

''I'll be the first to admit that I didn't think that offense was going to work
in our league,'' said the former Auburn coach Pat Dye, whose quarterbacks in the
1980s and early 1990s could hand the ball off to running backs  like  Bo
Jackson, Lionel James and Brent Fullwood.

Louisiana State, Alabama, Georgia, Vanderbilt and Tennessee will look more like
N.F.L. teams in traditional alignments with quarterbacks under center this
season, but Auburn, Kentucky, Mississippi State and Florida will spread players
sideline to sideline.

Mississippi is a spread team when it goes into its Wild Rebel formation,
featuring a direct snap to running back Dexter McCluster. South Carolina will
feature a tailback, but Coach Steve Spurrier will also flood the field with
wideouts, put a quarterback in the shotgun and create the dream of spread gurus,
which are the one-on-one matchups in the open field.

Arkansas is considered a multiple-offense team, but Coach Bobby Petrino ran a
spread offense at Louisville and has the ability to get his team into a spread
look. L.S.U. will run some version of the spread with its mobile quarterback,
the 6-foot-4 Jordan Jefferson.

Phil Savage, the former general manager of the Cleveland Browns, who will be
Alabama's radio analyst this season, said he did not expect the SEC to adopt the
spread as much as the Big 12 because the SEC has a wider talent pool with which
to play more conventional football. Savage said Oklahoma and Texas dominated
recruiting in the Big 12, so the other 10 colleges, which did not get as many
blue-chip recruits, responded with the spread offense.

What will inspire spread enthusiasts most is if Dan Mullen, a Meyer disciple who
is the new coach at Mississippi State, turns around a downtrodden program with
the spread. Florida wins with the spread offense, but it can generally recruit
more talented players than Mississippi State.

More inspiration to run the spread will eventually come from the N.F.L., which
has been reluctant to let its millionaire quarterbacks sit in the pocket without
a running back offering blocking protection, Savage said.

''As the spread expands across the country, the N.F.L. evaluators are going to
have to adjust their vision of the world,'' Savage said. ''If you don't have Tom
Brady or Peyton Manning, if you don't have the Guy, you need to be creative and
adjust to the quarterback who might not be the prototype.''

What makes the spread so challenging to defend is that there are so many
variations -- option, Wildcat, four wide receivers, handoffs up the middle
through gaps -- that defenses must prepare for something different every week.

''When the quarterback's a runner, you create another blocker, or a receiver
that you have to cover,'' Alabama Coach Nick Saban said. ''So that kind of
creates another gap on defense. And I think that's very difficult to defend.''

The spread has its downside, at least from one vantage point. Even though
Florida led the SEC in rushing last season, it has not produced a top-shelf
tailback under Meyer, partly because rival coaches have been able to convince
high school stars that tailback is not an important position in the Gators'
scheme, especially with quarterback Tim Tebow able to run the ball effectively
for Florida.

Clemson tailback C.J. Spiller, who is from Florida, almost transferred to
Florida in 2007, but Tommy Bowden, his coach at the time, said he told Spiller
that he would not be the featured back in the Gators' offense -- Tebow would be.

Auburn installed the spread in 2008 under a new offensive coordinator, Tony
Franklin, but it was a disaster, Dye said, because the other coaches on the
staff did not buy into the system. Franklin was fired during the season, and
Auburn ranked eighth in the conference in total offense.

Dye said that the spread had a foothold in the SEC but that the conference's
identity would not change.

''What separates us from others is that we have this talent pool of fast, fast
players in these states around us to pick from to play defense,'' he said.
''We're defense first. That won't change.''

WA Supreme Court rules 'Blakely' doesn't apply to consecutive sentences

BYLINE: Lawyers Weekly USA Staff

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 374  words


A defendant's Sixth Amendment rights were not violated when a judge rather than
a jury decided factors underlying the imposition of consecutive sentences for
his attempted murder convictions, the Washington Supreme Court has ruled.

A jury convicted the defendant of three counts of attempted murder. The
convictions involved the defendant firing a gun at three rival gang members. He
wounded two of the victims.

State law requires judges to impose consecutive sentences when a defendant is
convicted of two or more "serious violent offenses" that arise from "separate
and distinct criminal conduct. " The trial judge in this case imposed
consecutive sentences after concluding that, because there were separate
victims, the defendant's offenses arose from separate and distinct criminal
conduct.

The defendant argued that his Sixth Amendment rights were violated under the
U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Blakely v. Washington (124 S.Ct. 2531) because
a judge rather than a jury decided facts leading to the imposition of
consecutive sentences.

But the court disagreed.

"While it is true that the imposition of consecutive sentences increases a
defendant's aggregate term of imprisonment, it is significant that in Blakely
the court was not concerned with consecutive sentences. Indeed, the court
considered the sentence on an additional count irrelevant. It seems clear from
Blakely that so long as the sentence for any single offense does not exceed the
statutory maximum for that offense, as is the case here, Blakely is satisfied.
Additionally, we note that consecutive sentences increase a defendant's total
sentence because he or she was convicted of multiple serious violent offenses,
not because the sentence exceeded the statutory maximum for any single offense.
A defendant has no right to serve concurrent sentences for committing multiple
serious violent offenses," the court said.

It noted similar decisions from the 2nd, 3rd, 5th and 9th Circuits, as well as
from state courts in Alaska, California, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa,
Kansas, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Hampshire and Tennessee.

Police link up with the cyberspace patrol

BYLINE: Michael Weiss; STAFF WRITER

SECTION: FEATURES; Pg. 06D

LENGTH: 529 words


Atlanta loves nothing more than marketing itself to the world. But the Atlanta
Police Department's Web site may make some people think twice about visiting.

At least that's the idea.

The names and addresses of those arrested for sex and drug violations, such as
solicitation of sodomy or heroin possession, are listed on the site (and on the
city's public access cable channel). The department plans to add photographs
soon. The hope is that a fear of being humiliated publicly will make a few
potential violators stay home, the police say.

"We're telling everybody around the world that if you want a prostitute, don't
come to Atlanta to do it," says the site's designer, Lt. Damian Finch.

The home page ---which has been up for a few months ---offers more than just
lists of arrests. Although the department is the first Georgia law enforcement
agency on the Internet, Atlanta Police are part of a large group of police
departments nationwide hoping to use the Web to bring them closer to their
citizens.

Atlanta's site, for example, has several places where a visitor can click to ask
questions about the department. Finch answers most of the e- mails himself,
usually within four hours.

There's also links to other Atlanta sites, a roll call of officers killed in the
line of duty, instructions for people looking to trade police patches and a link
to real-time interstate traffic conditions.

A recent addition to the site: photos and a most-wanted list. The November
roundup offers six suspects, accused of crimes ranging from murder to child
molestation and armed robbery.

Most of the online sites for metropolitan police departments offer features
similar to Atlanta's: most-wanted lists and departmental organization charts.
Some are consumer-friendly guides to crime prevention, while others focus on
equipment and shop talk.

THE SITES
Atlanta Police Department: http://www.atlantapd.org

Nashville: The Metropolitan Nashville Police Department's site, one of just a
few for Southern police departments, is also one of the snazziest. It's got
audio of a car chase, movies of crime scenes and a demo version of Danger High,
a Macintosh-only game that teaches teenagers how to respond to threats in
school. It's loaded with practical advice, with sections on domestic abuse,
self-defense and choosing a protective device such as pepper spray.
http://www.Nashville.Net/ police/

Miami: The Metro-Dade Police Department has many of the usual features, plus
safety tips for visitors. http://dbs-mia.com/ mdpd

Los Angeles: Crime California-style ---the site's crime alerts section includes
warnings about a robbery spree targeting only men with Mercedes-Benzes and Rolex
watches. http://www.instanet.com/lapd

New York: The NYPD site looks nice but is heavy on forms and phone numbers
---not especially useful to nonresidents. But it does have some nifty pictures
of police equipment, including choppers, boats and a bomb- defusing robot.

Conference USAReturning starters (offense/defense): 7/7.Bowl appearances: 10
(last in 2002).Of note: Tulane didn't need to leave their own stadium to find

Johnson was tabbed after spending six years with the Saints. He was also a coach
on the University of Miami's 2001 national champions.

Tulsa Golden HurricaneCoach: Bill Blankenship (second season; 8-5, 8-5).2011
record: 8-5, 7-1 in Conference USA.Returning starters (offense/defense):
6/7.Bowl appearances: 18 (last in 2011).Of note: Tulsa returns 85 percent of
last season's rushing and 76 percent of its receiving, but graduated 96 percent
of its passing yards with the departure of G.J. Kinne. Junior Cody Green, a
transfer from Nebraska who played 17 games for the Cornhuskers, emerged from
spring as the new No. 1.

UTEP MinersCoach: Mike Price (ninth season; 45-52, 174-174).2011 record: 5-7,
2-6 in Conference USA.Returning starters (offense/defense): 7/4.Bowl

record: 5-7, 4-4 in Conference USA.Returning starters (offense/defense):
7/7.Bowl appearances: 17 (last in 2010).Of note: ECU has led C-USA in attendance
for four straight seasons, ranking 17th overall in the NCAA last year at 50,012
and first among teams from non-automatic qualifier BCS members. The Pirates sold
out all six home games last year.

Marshall Thundering HerdCoach: Doc Holliday (third season; 12-13, 12-13).2011
record: 7-5, 5-3 in Conference USA.Returning starters (offense/defense):
8/5.Bowl appearances: 10 (last in 2011).Of note: Marshall had the 16th strongest
schedule in the nation last season, second among non-automatic qualifier schools
behind Tulsa (13th). Its seven victories against that schedule was its most wins
since 2003.

Memphis TigersCoach: Justin Fuente (first season).2011 record: 2-10, 1-7 in
Conference USA.Returning starters (offense/defense): 6/6.Bowl appearances: Seven
(last in 2008).Of note: Punter Tom Hornsey, from Geelong, Australia, set
single-season school records with 95 punts for 3,993 yards last year. The 95
punts led nationally and the yardage total was second.

UAB BlazersCoach: Garrick McGee (first season).2011 record: 3-9, 3-5 in
Conference USA.Returning starters (offense/defense): 7/4.Bowl appearances: One
(2004)Of note: McGee comes to UAB after four seasons at Arkansas, the last two
of which he was the offensive coordinator. He was a finalist for the 2011
Broyles Award as the nation's top assistant coach. He is just the fourth coach
in Blazers' history. UAB began play as a Division III school in 1991.

UCF Golden KnightsCoach: George O'Leary (ninth year; 50-51, 102-84).2011 record:
5-7, 3-5 in Conference USA.Returning starters (offense/defense): 8/8.Bowl
appearances: Five (last in 2010).Of note: Despite the losing record, the Knights
outscored their opponents 325-220 while outgaining them 406.8-303.3. That's
because a nation-leading six losses out of the seven were by seven points or
fewer.

VIKINGS AT WASHINGTON;
Vikings stealing from the very best;
Minnesota has adapted the NFL's current gold standards - the ``Tampa-2'' defense
and the ``West Coast'' offense.

BYLINE: Mark Craig, Staff Writer

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 1C

LENGTH: 1008 words


Reigning NFL Defensive Player of the Year Brian Urlacher winced when the term
used to describe the Chicago Bears' defensive scheme was referred to as the
"Tampa-2."

"It's Chicago-2," the Bears middle linebacker growled before letting out a
laugh.

A week later, Indianapolis coach Tony Dungy was told Urlacher had playfully
pushed for a name change based on last year's No. 1-ranked scoring defense under
Dungy protege Lovie Smith. It was Dungy's success in Tampa that created the
trendy term for the scheme that used to be simply called a double-zone or
Cover-2.

"Actually," Dungy said, "it should be called the Minnesota-2. It's what we ran
when I was defensive coordinator with the Vikings [1992-95].

"I stole it from my playbook from when I played in Pittsburgh [1977-78], but it
really didn't take off until I got to Minnesota and mixed in some wrinkles from
assistants like Willie Shaw, Monte Kiffin and John Teerlinck.

When I got the head coaching job in Tampa in 1996, we put the same defense in
verbatim."

The evolution of football at the highest level never ends. With parity stronger
than ever, playbooks are thicker and work hours longer as teams search for
tweaks or innovations to their neighbor's offensive and defensive schemes.

Fans in the Twin Cities are in for a double dose Monday night when
offensive-minded coach Brad Childress' "West Coast" offense and first-year
defensive coordinator Mike Tomlin's Tampa-2 are unveiled in the season opener at
Washington.

The Tampa-2's ties to Minnesota are easily established through Dungy. That's not
the case with the West Coast offense, although longtime Vikings fans - and at
least one former coach with NFL offensive expertise stretching back to the famed
"Packer Sweep" - bristle when they hear analysts say this is Minnesota's maiden
voyage with the league's most popular offense over the past 25 years.

Although the term was created because of the success 49ers Hall of Fame coach
Bill Walsh had with Hall of Fame quarterback Joe Montana in the 1980s, some of
the same concepts existed in the Vikings offense a decade or two earlier.

"To tell you the truth, I don't know what the hell the West Coast offense is,"
said Jerry Burns, who won a couple of Super Bowls as Vince Lombardi's assistant
in Green Bay, coached in four more as Bud Grant's assistant in Minnesota and
succeeded him for six seasons.

"I hear the TV analysts say a team is playing the West Coast offense,'' Burns
said. ``If they are, then what kind of offense is the other team playing? East
Coast?"

Burns said the only similarity he sees in West Coast offenses is that each has a
basic formation that includes a running back, fullback, one tight end, a split
end and a flanker.

"We were doing the same things with Chuck Foreman and Bill Brown, faking the
ball to the back, pulling and trapping with the guards," Burns said. "We had the
short passes. We'd hit Anthony Carter on the quick slants. It was just offensive
football."

Like many offensive coaches, Childress' West Coast training can be traced to
Walsh. Childress coached under Andy Reid, who coached under Mike Holmgren, who
was Walsh's quarterbacks coach in San Francisco from 1986 to `88.

"Of all the teams that run the West Coast offense today, Mike's in Seattle is
the closest to what we ran," said Walsh, now the special assistant to the
athletic director at Stanford. "Things evolve. I'm sure a lot of what teams are
doing now is superior to what we did. The game has changed."

Walsh traced the origin of his offense to his study of Rams and Chargers Hall of
Fame coach Sid Gillman, a Minneapolis native; and Blanton Collier, an assistant
and successor to Cleveland Hall of Fame coach Paul Brown. Gillman became an NFL
head coach in 1955. Collier was on Brown's original staff in the All-America
Football Conference in 1946.

"Sid Gillman was the father of the passing game in football," Walsh said. "He
really opened my eyes, although he was more wide open with the deep passing game
than I was. And then Blanton was an absolute technician. I took ideas from both
of them."

Walsh's goal in the West Coast offense was to get 30 first downs a game. That,
he said, would control the ball and undoubtedly lead to enough touchdowns to win
the game.

Eventually, defenses had to devise schemes to deal with the three- to five-step
drops and overall quick, rhythmic pace of the West Coast offense. Dungy felt the
deep Cover-2, if played properly with faster defenders and fewer blitzes, would
force West Coast offenses to make longer drives and thereby create more
possibilities for mistakes and turnovers.

Although Dungy was fired a year before the Bucs won the 2003 Super Bowl, his
fingerprints were all over that defense.

"We played three good West Coast offenses in the playoffs and Super Bowl that
year. San Francisco, Philadelphia and Oakland," said Tomlin, the Bucs' defensive
backs coach the past five seasons. "And we beat them all."

Childress took notice as Philadelphia's offensive coordinator. He decided that
if he ever became a head coach he'd hire someone to install the Tampa-2.

Childress also has said that having someone well-schooled in the Tampa-2 helps
him understand its nuances. And that makes it easier for him to adjust his West
Coast offense.

Flexibility, after all, is one of the key selling points of the West Coast.

"Yes, it's a ball-control offense," said new Packers coach Mike McCarthy, who
learned the offense under Paul Hackett, who learned it as an assistant under
Walsh. "But the offense I coordinated in New Orleans as opposed to the offense I
coordinated in San Francisco to the offense I'm coordinating here, all three are
totally different."

Tampa-2 experts say they're tweaking just as hard on the other side of the ball.

"When I was in Tampa, we broke this defense down every season and rebuilt it,"
Tomlin said. "You have to. It's the only way you keep those offensive dogs off
of you.

"But I'm sure with all the success of the Tampa-2, the offensive guys are down
in their labs fighting back. That's just football. It's a constant evolution."

NFL: Broncos and Seahawks showed two ways to reach a Super Bowl

SECTION: SPORTS

LENGTH: 770 words


The Denver Broncos and Seattle Seahawks showed there are two different routes to
the Super Bowl.

The Broncos did it with offence. They rolled up the most yards (457.3 per game)
in the National Football League this season and scored more points (37.9 per
game) than any other team in NFL history. Quarterback Peyton Manning's 5,477
passing yards and 55 touchdowns were also the most in NFL history.

The Seahawks did it with defence. Seattle allowed the fewest yards (273.6),
fewest points (14.4) and fewest passing yards (172.0) per game and had the most
take-aways (39), interceptions (28) and best turnover differential (plus-20) in
the league in 2013.

Add it up either way, and each team finished 13-3. And next Sunday in East
Rutherford, N.J., they will form the first matchup of No. 1 seeds in the Super
Bowl since the 2009 season, when Manning's Indianapolis Colts lost to New
Orleans in Super Bowl XLIV.

This will be only the second Super Bowl since 1970 in which the top-ranked
offence meets the top-ranked defence. Tampa Bay's No. 1-ranked defence defeated
Oakland's No. 1 offence, 48-21, in Super Bowl XXXVII.

And this will be the fifth Super Bowl since 1970 that the top-ranked scoring
defence meets the top-ranked scoring offence. The top-ranked scoring defences
are 3-1 in those games.

Pittsburgh's top-ranked defence beat Dallas in Super Bowl XIII; San Francisco
beat Miami in Super Bowl XIX; and the New York Giants beat Buffalo in Super Bowl
XXV. The only top-ranked offence to win was San Francisco over Denver in Super
Bowl XXIV.

But the days of defences winning championships changed in the 2000s with new the
rules favouring offences and with the proliferation of more sophisticated
passing games led by Tom Brady, Drew Brees and Manning.

Could the Seahawks reverse the trend and go back to old-school defence winning
the Super Bowl?

"That's a cool question," Seattle coach Pete Carroll said. "When you say Manning
and Brady, you're talking about a couple of the greatest passers to ever play
this game, in great systems that recognize how to utilize their talent at its
fullest, and the best way to do that is let those guys throw the ball all over
the yard. They could handle it and win championships doing it. That is what
we're facing.

"Years before, I don't know if they were throwing the ball like that, so this is
a new challenge in that regard. That statement that defence wins championships
has been out there a long time. I don't know that it ever went away. We'll find
out."

In scoring a record 606 points in the regular season, the Broncos topped 40
points in a team-record six games and tied the NFL record by exceeding 50 points
in three games.

The Broncos became the first NFL team with five players scoring 10 touchdowns
from scrimmage: wide receivers Demaryius Thomas (14), Eric Decker (11), Wes
Welker (10) and tight end Julius Thomas (12) on receptions from Manning and
running back Knowshon Moreno (10 rushing, three receiving).

"Nobody has ever taken more command of the game than he has at this stage of his
career," Carroll said of Manning, "and the coaching staff has allowed that to
happen where he can be in total command of what's going on. He sees every
defence, he knows all the options, he makes his decisions all the way to the
last second ... there are few guys who have ever played the game that can do
that.

"In the old days, quarterbacks called the plays, but they had a couple of
formations. You go back to Joe Namath in the Super Bowl when he was running Matt
Snell off of one side and throwing the ball out there. ... It was a different
execution of the game.

"This is thrilling to have a chance to go against the best guys to ever play."

Seattle will counteract with perhaps the best secondary in the NFL led by
loquacious cornerback Richard Sherman, who led the NFL in interceptions with
eight.

Sherman's postgame tirade and attack of San Francisco wide receiver Michael
Crabtree after the NFC championship game was the talk of football last week, but
he's showing a little more respect for Manning.

"We really embrace that man," Sherman said. "As a defence, we respect the heck
out of Peyton Manning, but as a true competitor, as competitive as our team is,
you wouldn't want to have it any other way. You want the best of the best;
otherwise you don't feel like you're getting the biggest challenge of your life.

"If you lose, you understand that you lost to the best quarterback in the world
and you can accept that. If you win, you understand that you were playing
against the best quarterback in the world and it feels that much sweeter. It's
just a competitive drive in you."

U.S. Marshals arrest man accused of sex offense

BYLINE: The Daily News, Jacksonville, N.C.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 361 words


July 14--A man wanted by the Onslow County Sheriff's Office for the sexual
assault of a child has been arrested by the U.S. Marshals Service in New
Orleans, according to information from the U.S. Marshals' office.

Pedro Cabrera, also known as Juan Bonilla and Angel Rodriguez, was charged on
Nov. 10 with first-degree statutory sex offense and indecent liberties with a
child. The offenses charged are alleged to have occurred during September to
November.

Cabrera is accused of taking indecent liberties with a 6-year-old girl, Sheriff
Ed Brown told The Daily News Thursday.

Onslow County detectives contacted the U.S. Marshals Service on June 29 and
requested assistance in locating Cabrera.

Through the joint efforts of the Marshals Service in Eastern North Carolina,
Eastern Virginia and Eastern Louisiana, Cabrera was located at a construction
site in New Orleans and taken into custody Thursday afternoon.

The U.S. Marshals Service, Eastern District of North Carolina, sponsors a
multi-agency task force that routinely targets the worst offenders in Eastern
North Carolina. The Violent Fugitive Task Force is a team comprised of law
enforcement officers from the U.S. Marshals Service, Wilmington Police
Department, Raleigh Police Department, Wilson Police Department, Greenville
Police Department, Sharpsburg Police Department, Lumberton Police Department,
Fayetteville Police Department, Cumberland County Sheriff's Office, Wake County
Sheriff's Office, Nash County Sheriff's Office, Pitt County Sheriff's Office and
the North Carolina Division of Community Corrections.

The task force's objective is to seek out and arrest violent fugitives,
according to information from the U.S. Marshals. In 2010, U.S. Marshals task
forces arrested more than 73,000 state and local fugitives, according to the
Marshals' office information.

Good Spread Awaits Maryland in Bowl;
Purdue's Unique Offense Poses Challenges

BYLINE: Marc Carig, Washington Post Staff Writer

SECTION: Sports; E03

LENGTH: 598 words


Before he had a chance to study game tape of Purdue's offense, Maryland
cornerback Josh Wilson couldn't take his attention from a glaring number on the
Boilermakers' stat sheet: 3,721.

"That's enough to get my eyes open," Wilson said of Purdue quarterback Curtis
Painter's passing yards this season.

The Terrapins face the Boilermakers for the first time in Friday's Champs Sports
Bowl. The game poses a unique challenge.

Through 12 games, the Terrapins have lined up against teams that run the spread
option, such as West Virginia. They've played against those with a more
traditional balanced offense, like Boston College. But Purdue Coach Joe Tiller
plays an offensive style that Maryland hasn't seen this season, a balanced
spread offense that leans toward passing but has shown the ability to run.

Maryland Coach Ralph Friedgen called the Boilermakers' offense a mix of what the
Terps have faced before.

"They pose a lot of problems for our offense," Friedgen said. "Hopefully we can
go down there and play one of our better games."

The problems begin at quarterback, where Painter has followed Kyle Orton and
Drew Brees on the list of quarterbacks who have put up big numbers while playing
in Tiller's open system.

"He's a big, strong quarterback with a strong arm," Friedgen said of Painter.

Thanks to Painter, the Boilermakers led the Big Ten in passing offense (293.7
yards per game) and total offense (425.8) while throwing 23 touchdowns passes.
The 6-foot-4, 228-pound junior also faced some criticism for his 18
interceptions and for an offensive slide during which the high-powered offense
scored just three total points in back-to-back meetings against Wisconsin and
Penn State midway through the season.

"I think that he's kind of a streaky guy," Friedgen said. "When he gets going,
he's pretty darn good."

That streakiness showed in Painter's last three games, in which he has thrown
seven interceptions, including three against Indiana on Nov. 18. But he also
managed six touchdown passes in that time, including four against Hawaii.

Painter also has the help of a dangerous target in the speedy Dorien Bryant. The
5-10 junior averages more than six catches per game, which ranks 12th nationally
and first in the Big Ten.

But the Terrapins have had success against the passing game, a trend that Wilson
hopes continues against the Boilermakers.

"We haven't allowed the passing game to eat us alive," said Wilson, who will
likely draw coverage duties against Bryant in what should be a
speed-against-speed matchup. "We've been able to control it. Even when we went
to Georgia Tech, we didn't let the pass get us."

Purdue, though, has been able to run the ball this season behind sophomore
running backs Kory Sheets and Jaycen Taylor. After serving as the backup last
season, Sheets emerged as a consistent runner while Taylor, a junior college
transfer, earned steady carries. The two combined for 1,256 yards and 15
touchdowns.

"Even though they threw the ball extremely well, they've got a balanced attack,"
Friedgen said. "And to me, that's what makes it tough."

To prepare for the Boilermakers, Maryland defensive coordinator Chris Cosh said
he wanted to shift his team's focus toward fundamentals, especially during the
long break between the Terps' regular season finale against Wake Forest and
Friday's bowl game.

"Sometimes what happens when you get in the season, you go from week to week and
you're preparing for a new system, and a scheme and all of that, and you have
less individual time to work on fundamentals," Cosh said. "Now we have time."

BOXING;
Reid likely to stay on U.S. roster;
USA Boxing defers decision on fighter charged with battery

BYLINE: Jeff Schultz; STAFF WRITER

SECTION: SPORTS OLYMPICS; Pg. 07G

LENGTH: 370 words


Effectively deciding David Reid's Olympic future before the Florida district
attorney's office decides his legal future, USA Boxing officials chose to take
no action Friday against the Atlanta-bound fighter until battery and domestic
violence charges play out in the courts.

As a result of the non-action, Reid likely will remain on the Olympic roster. He
will plead innocent to misdemeanor charges that stemmed from an argument with
his girlfriend, Shalonda Ellis, early Wednesday morning in an Orlando hotel. He
has a July 24 court date - five days into the Olympics - but an attorney can
enter a plea on Reid's behalf.

There's also a chance the district attorney's office will not file charges,
given the two are from out of state (Philadelphia) and Ellis apparently has
decided not to pursue the matter. But Dick Jucknath of the district attorney's
domestic violence unit said the office would not hesitate to file charges if
evidence warrants, regardless of Ellis' lack of cooperation. A decision is
expected in one to three weeks.

One potential problem for Reid is 156-pound alternate Darnell Wilson, who
believes the Olympian should be thrown off the team to open a spot for him.
Wilson is considering legal avenues. "Right now, I'm not sure what I'm going to
do," he said.

Revelations that another Olympic boxer, Lawrence Clay-Bey, is in a
court-supervised rehabilitation program for felony sexual assault charges filed
in Hartford, Conn., in February 1995 also apparently will not affect the U.S.
team. Clay-Bey's problems predate the Olympic code of conduct; he has a court
date pending next May.

"It was 16 months ago," said USA Boxing president Jerry Dusenberry. "It has no
relevance to the Lawrence Clay-Bey of today."

USA Boxing may have benefited from fortunate timing in the Reid case. USOC
general counsel Ron Rowen told Dusenberry the conduct code went into effect
Wednesday. Reid's arrest came at 2 a.m. Wednesday but was a continuation of a
Tuesday argument.

Reid was asked to pay $ 500 to the hotel to cover damages and an extra room for
Ellis following the altercation. Reid also was restricted to his room for the
team's remaining personal appearances in Orlando this weekend.

JSU prepares for top-gun Eastern Illinois offense

BYLINE: Al Muskewitz, The Anniston Star, Ala.

SECTION: SPORTS

LENGTH: 696 words


Nov. 11--JACKSONVILLE -- The emotional wave that follows a team's biggest win of
the season can keep those in its wake wired well on to dawn, but something else
had Jacksonville State coach Bill Clark restless Sunday morning.

Football coaches are notoriously early risers, especially during the season, but
even this was a little too early.

It was about 2:30 in the morning and while some who had reveled in the
Gamecocks' 68-10 dismantling of Eastern Kentucky might be just coming home,
Clark was moving toward the door to start his day. Mrs. Coach looked up through
sleepy eyes and wondered aloud where her husband was going at such an hour.

"Gotta go to work," he said.

Playing the second-ranked team in the country with a nearly unstoppable offense
will do that to a coach.

The 22nd-ranked Gamecocks (8-2, 4-2 Ohio Valley Conference), in the national
polls this week for only the second time this season and first since Oct. 7,
will be out to score another monumental win Saturday when they travel to No. 2
Eastern Illinois.

The Panthers (9-1, 6-0 OVC) have become the Oregon of the FCS with their
fast-tempo, spread-the-field offense. (EIU coach Dino Babers would probably
prefer you call it the Baylor, because he coached future Heisman Trophy winner
Robert Griffin III there and brought the Bears' tendencies to his new job.)

Eastern Illinois ranks first in the FCS in scoring offense and total offense and
are second in passing offense.

JSU defensive coordinator Duwan Walker can empathize with his boss' early
rising. In the wee hours of Sunday morning in another part of town, he was going
through the same routine.

"These guys, it's no secret they're good," Walker said. "We're worried with any
team at the beginning of the week. In my time of doing this, if you're not
worried at the beginning of the week you might be in trouble at the end of the
week.

"These guys will have you worried no matter what time of the week it is. We'll
be going into Saturday morning still looking at things and making sure we feel
good about what we're doing."

In his last year as South Alabama's defensive coordinator, Clark grew accustomed
to heading to the office before the milkman arrived at the door.

There was Tennessee-Martin that was leading the country in total offense. Then
in his league there was a Louisiana-Monroe team that had beaten Arkansas and
hung with Auburn. There was Troy, then Arkansas State. Every week it was a
nightmare scenario for a fledgling FBS program.

"We were in the No. 1 offensive league in the whole country and ? you just
couldn't sleep," he said. "You felt you had to be really good. You may be
thinking they could score 70 on you, and we didn't have the people everybody
else was playing."

The Gamecocks do, but that still might not be enough.

The Panthers (9-1, 6-0 OVC), who can clinch the outright conference title with a
win, can make a team look really bad if it's not on its game.

They rank No. 1 nationally in total offense and scoring offense and No. 2 in
passing offense, and Walker said they're capable of scoring 'a whole lot more'
than they have. They've scored at least 34 points in every game -- 39 in a loss
-- and have passed 50 four times.

Quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo has rewritten the OVC passing record book and his
favorite receiver, Erik Lora, is third on the FCS all-time receptions list. The
Panthers are also third in rushing offense and first in scoring defense in
league games. The average margin of their nine wins is 27 points.

"When you look at a team you look for weakness," Walker said. "You don't see
weaknesses (in EIU). They're going to make you cover every inch of the field,
length and width. They'll keep you up at night. If we have a weakness
defensively, it'll be exposed.

"This is one of the elite teams at our level, so it's going to be a good test to
see where we are overall as a program and defensively. This is going to be one
of those games that will tell us where we are."

SEC caliber?;
Tide talks up OSU offense

BYLINE: Andrea Cohen, Staff Writer

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 2C

LENGTH: 512 words

DATELINE: SHREVEPORT, La.


SHREVEPORT, La. -- Among Southeastern Conference folks, calling anything "SEC
caliber" is about as high as a compliment can get.

That phrase was rolling off the tongues of Alabama's defensive players right and
left as they talked about the Oklahoma State offense they will face in
Thursday's Independence Bowl.

"That offense could easily play in the SEC," defensive end Wallace Gilberry
said. "That running back (Dantrell Savage) is good. They can run it or pass it.
We have to come out with the energy and poise to bring the trophy back home."

Defensive tackle Jeremy Clark went one better.

"This is probably the best offense we've seen all year," Clark said. "They have
two good backs, good receivers and a dual-threat quarterback. We have to play
sound defense. They have a good scheme."

With an offense that frequently sputtered out in the red zone this fall,
Alabama's defense was a bright(er) spot, giving up 18 points per game. Oklahoma
State was the opposite, with its explosive Bobby Reid-led offense averaging 35.3
points and 409 yards of offense a game.

Defensive coordinator and interim head coach Joe Kines said the Tide (6-6)
defense will abide by the same principles it has all season.

"Oh, we ain't gonna do much different," Kines said. "We're gonna dance with the
same old gal we came to the dance with. We try to get off the ball, run to the
ball. We try to keep 'em in front of us coverage-wise and try to get a little
heat on the passer. It's not rocket science."

Kines said the Cowboys' offense has some elements of other teams Alabama played.

"We played one team that ran some option like them," Kines said. "We played one
team that threw the ball kinda like them. Most offenses are kind of a
combination of things. They put it together pretty well."

All-SEC defensive back Simeon Castille said the Cowboys' multiple weapons stood
out when he watched OSU on film, particularly on "big plays" -- 50-yard
scrambles by Reid, big gains by Savage, catches by Adarius Bowman and D'Juan
Woods.

"(If) it's not the quarterback, it's the running back," Castille said. "If it's
not the running back, it's the receivers. If it's not the receivers, it's the
return guy. It's like they have weapons all over the field, so I think we're
going to have to play well all three phases."

Several players compared the Cowboys' offensive look to No. 2 Florida. The
Gators came back from a 10-7 halftime deficit to beat Alabama 28-13 on Sept. 30.

"(Like Florida) they'll spread the ball out and throw it around, but they also
give the running back a chance to run the ball on you," Castille said.

With Alabama's strong receiving corps, headlined by DJ Hall, Castille and the
rest of the secondary prepares against good players in practice. But they don't
see receivers as big and strong as 6-foot-4, 220-pound Bowman and 6-foot-1,
210-pound Woods.

"The only thing that's different than our guys is they're a little slimmer than
Oklahoma State's guys," Castille said. "(The Cowboys receivers are) big,
physical, good hands, can run -- I mean, anything you'd want in a receiver."

Husker receivers Fluellen, LeFlore support each others on returns to lineup

As others pondered his possible demise, Isaiah Fluellen said he never wavered in
his confidence.

Fluellen, a Nebraska wide receiver, said he generally remained patient
throughout preseason training camp in August while he recovered from hamstring
injuries to both legs.

"I'm a real patient guy," Fluellen said this week. "I was pretty confident in my
abilities. I went through some minor setbacks. But they were just setbacks. I
stayed positive."

Fluellen's recurring hamstring problems cropped up four days into preseason
camp, in mid-August. Meanwhile, true freshman Terrence Nunn of Houston was
working with the first-string offense and wowing coaches with his playmaking
ability.

Fortunately for Fluellen, he had fostered a solid grasp of Nebraska's new
offense during spring drills, although hamstring problems sidelined him then,
too.

Indeed, Fluellen spent much of the offseason limping around the NU football
complex, unable to flash the sprinter's speed that enabled him last season to
bolt behind defensive backs and catch his share of long passes. He finished with
15 receptions for 287 yards, an average of 19.1 yards per catch.

Fluellen now finds himself near full speed and ready to make an impact. A
6-foot, 185-pound sophomore, Fluellen has played in all three games this season,
but is yet to catch a pass.

It should be noted that Fluellen didn't catch a pass during the first three
games last season. Then, in game four, he burned the Southern Mississippi
secondary for a 43-yard touchdown reception.

Of course, the Nebraska offense has changed dramatically since last season, and
the Husker receivers aren't complaining.

"This offense kind of revolves around the wide receivers,"Fluellen said. "So,
obviously, we're the ones who can change the game around so quick with big
plays. There are a lot of opportunities for us.

"It's a great offense. With all the shifting before the snap, defenses don't
know what we're going to do."

The new Nebraska offense is more complex than the previous Husker offense,
though the previous offense also had its share of complexities.

"In the old offense, you had to know plays," Fluellen said. "In this offense,
you have to know concepts. In this offense, they might throw in a new play, but
it's really all the same concepts. You just have to know your concepts and
understand the nature of the offense.

"If you know the nature of the offense, then you'll know the offense."

Fluellen plays the "Z" receiver position along with Nunn and junior Mark LeFlore
of Omaha, who struggled through August with a toe injury.

LeFlore said this week his toe feels "a lot better," though he still encounters
soreness on occasion. He played more snaps than either Nunn or Fluellen in
Nebraska's last game, catching two passes for 13 yards in a seven-point win at
Pittsburgh.

The 5-11, 190-pound LeFlore said he and Fluellen commiserated often during their
early-season convalescence.

"Isaiah's my boy - it seems like every time I'm hurt, he's hurt,"LeFlore said.
"We're always in the same boat."

Said Fluellen:"We've tried to keep each other positive. We were like, 'When we
get back out there, let's see what happens, because the team needs us.' The
ultimate goal is to try to win the championship, so we needed to do whatever it
took to stay healthy."

Fluellen has run an electronically timed 4.53-second 40-yard dash, making him
one of the top two or three fastest Nebraska receivers.

"I think Willie Amos has me by a couple of steps," Fluellen said, referring to
the Huskers' senior "X" receiver.

Fluellen was upbeat this week as Nebraska prepared to play Kansas on Saturday
night. As for his demise in the Huskers' offensive picture, well, the August
speculation now appears to be off-base.

Like Fluellen, LeFlore also heard whispers of having a diminished role in the
new system.

"The media, they don't know what they're talking about,"LeFlore said. "The only
thing they can go off of, you know, is what they see. It's not that me and
Isaiah didn't have the ability, we just weren't able to play."

Pro Basketball;
New Ways for Old Knicks

BYLINE: By SAM GOLDAPER

SECTION: Section 8; Page 9; Column 4; Sports Desk

LENGTH: 809 words


The names are the same but the Knicks are different.

When the Knicks last met the Milwaukee Bucks, on Dec. 29, they were a struggling
team seeking an identity after being guided by three different coaches in three
seasons. They were not suited for the half-court game, lacked intensity and were
unable to establish defensive consistency.

Al Bianchi was still the general manager; John MacLeod was in his third week as
the coach; Mark Jackson was the starting point guard; Maurice Cheeks was coming
off the bench.

At that time, the Bucks beat the Knicks for the third time in the young season,
109-100, to drop New York's record to 12-15.

Tracing the Change

When the two teams meet this afternoon at the Bradley Center in Milwaukee, the
Bucks will be facing a Knick team that has won 10 of its last 11 games and
solidified its playoff status as it reached the .500 mark for the first time
since Nov. 27.

Just what has changed?

For one thing, MacLeod has introduced a motion offense run by Cheeks at point
guard. John Starks is Cheeks's backup and Jackson seldom plays. On defense, the
Knicks are applying more pressure.

Also, MacLeod has managed to provide some motivation, which has resulted in more
hustle and enthusiasm. Here is a look at how this turnaround came about.

The Motion Offense

The turnaround began after the Seattle SuperSonics took the Knicks completely
out of their half-court offense and routed them, 120-101, on Feb. 21. Two days
later, the motion offense made its debut against the Washington Bullets and it
helped turn a 20-point second-half deficit into a 104-101 victory.

The Knicks' offense in the half-court game was geared to funneling the ball
inside to Patrick Ewing, while everyone stood around and watched a stagnant
offense. The 7-foot center was a constant vicim of double- and triple-teaming,
especially in the closing minutes of the game.

"We've taken away that predictability," MacLeod said. "Basketball is not really
a complex game. In fact, it's simple. Free up the open man and give him the
ball."

The motion offense -- with constant motion of the ball and the players -- is
doing just that. With the Knicks freelancing more and everyone touching the
ball, it has been much more difficult to defend against them. Ewing is now
posting up on both sides of the lane and handing the ball off to the cutters to
the baskets.

The offense also better suits the athletic skills of Gerald Wilkins, Kiki
Vandeweghe and Charles Oakley. It allows Wilkins, a penetrator, to come in from
either side. The same is true for Vandeweghe when he is going to the basket, and
this allows Oakley to go to the boards more freely.

"This is better for us," said Ewing, "because we are constantly moving and
everyone feels more involved in the game. It's not just me in the offense, it's
everyone."

The new offense has also removed the "selfish" tag from many of the Knicks.

Defense

There have been two major changes. Instead of picking up opposing players at
half court, the Knick guards are now applying pressure at the
three-quarters-court, thus allowing teams less time to set up their offenses.

The transition defense has vastly improved, cutting down on the fast breaks,
easy layups and dunks opposing teams enjoyed almost at will earlier in the
season. Ewing and Oakley have been clogging the middle more.

"Gerald Wilkins's one-on-one defense has been sensational," said Paul Silas, the
Knicks' assistant coach. "He's been pushing his man where the help is. We've won
a flock of close games that we lost early in the season and the reason for that
we've pretty much been able to shut teams down defensively in close games.
Except for the Miami game, we've cut down drastically on our turnovers. We're
taking better care of the basketball."

Hustle and Composure

There is nothing like success. It breeds more success. With the selfish attitude
on offense gone and the improved defensive play, the Knicks are playing smarter
basketball. They appear to be more involved in every aspect of the game. They
are playing harder and chasing after loose balls.

The winning attitude that once seemed to belong only to Ewing has spread. The
Knicks are more poised and able to finish off a game, which is something they
lacked earlier.

Why has all this happened now?

"Through all the adversity," said MacLeod, "I stayed positive. I had a high
school coach back in the 1960's who taught me: 'Never give up on your players.
Stick with them.' "

The Knicks hold down the seventh playoff spot. If they finish there, they will
either meet the Boston Celtics or the Chicago Bulls in the opening round of the
playoffs, with no homecourt advantage. They have 18 games to better that
position.

They are looking upward, positively, at the teams ahead of them. A month ago
they were looking down.

Texas game kick-starts wild conference ride for Cowboys

During their bye week, both Oklahoma State and Texas got to watch as Kansas
State upset Oklahoma in Norman, West Virginia struggled with Maryland and Baylor
came back to beat pesky Louisiana-Monroe.

And with the full-fledged Big 12 schedule nearly beginning this weekend (TCU
plays SMU) - not to mention preseason title favorite OU already taking a loss -
OSU coach Mike Gundy and Co. are preparing for a wild ride through the
conference season. In addition to OSU's primetime showdown with the No. 12
Longhorns, No. 9 West Virginia hosts No. 25 Baylor and Texas Tech travels to
Iowa State in a trio of games that appear to be toss-ups.

"It's wide open, because there are a lot of teams that are really good," Gundy
said " ... I think there's more parity this year than there ever has been. Every
year, it's growing more and more in that area, which is good.

"It's good for the league. It's good for the fans. It creates interest. It's
hard on the coaches, but there's a number of teams that are good football
teams."

TEXAS PREPPING FOR FAST-PACED COWBOY OFFENSE

The fact OSU ranks in the top 6 in the nation in scoring offense, total offense,
passing offense and rushing offense isn't what concerns Texas defensive
coordinator Manny Diaz.

It's the number of plays the Cowboys run. OSU has snapped the ball 267 times in
three games, an average of 89 plays per game.

"It's hard to be a really good defensive player for 75, 85, 95 plays," Diaz told
the Longhorn Network. "You're just going to get worn out. This is a test.
Another great example of what we were able to get accomplished on the bye week
is that it's not just testing our first 11, it's testing our second 11.

"We've got to have 22 guys we can roll through this game. Otherwise, we're going
to wear down. We won't survive it."

FRIENDLY WAR  FOR STEWART

Cowboy receiver Josh Stewart chuckled when asked if this weekend's game against
UT is different from others, since he went to middle and high school in the
Dallas suburb of Denton.

"I've got a lot of friends back home that are kind of like against me right now,
because of Texas," Stewart said. "Yeah, I think it's an exciting game. We're
going to approach it like any other game, though, and play hard."

But what about for Stewart personally? He was once committed to Texas A&M to
play cornerback, before OSU offered him a scholarship and he switched his
pledge.

"I don't really have no hatred on any team," Stewart said, "but I know it's time
to strap up and go to war."

COACHES TO WEAR 'COACH TO CURE MD' PATCHES

Coaches at OSU and Texas, and at every Football Bowl Subdivision school playing
this weekend, will wear arm patches Saturday to help raise awareness of Duchenne
muscular dystrophy as part of the "Coach to Cure MD" program.

Coach to Cure MD is a partnership between the American Football Coaches
Association and Parent Project MD. The program, which is in its fifth year, is
expected to top $1 million in donations this season for research to find a cure
for the most common fatal childhood genetic disorder. Duchenne muscular
dystrophy is a progressive muscle disorder that causes loss of muscle function
and independence.

Fans can donate $5 by texting the word "CURE" to 90999 or can donate online at
www.CoachtoCureMD.org.

Quick fix for football;
COLLEGE FOOTBALL;
SWITCHING TO 30-SECOND CLOCK WOULD EVEN PLAYING FIELD

BYLINE: Berry Tramel

LENGTH: 559 words


Offenses are run amok in college football, especially between the Rockies and
the mighty Mississipp, and here's a counter that falls shy of kidnapping certain
quarterbacks in Austin, Norman, Columbia, Stillwater, Lubbock and Lawrence.

Go to a 30-second clock.

The no-huddle offense is all the rage; it allows offenses to dictate tempo and
personnel. Put a sharp quarterback behind the center, and the defense is on its
heels.

So take away some of the offense's ammo. Cut the play clock to 30 seconds from
the current 40. Make offenses get their plays in quicker; don't give offenses as
much time to change plays at the line of scrimmage.

The effect will be great. More plays, for one. That's what fans like about the
new clock. More snaps per game, and you'd get it with the 30-second clock. But
on those snaps, the defense would have a fighting chance.

Bob Stoops said it won't work unless you put transmitters in quarterbacks'
helmets, like the NFL has, so plays can be called more quickly.

"I don't think the communication is possible," Stoops said of a 30-second clock.

But why? Just get the plays in and called faster. Or live with the play you
called and don't audible. What would be the worst that could happen? OU-Texas
24-21 instead of 45-35? Sam Bradford and Todd Reesing throwing for a combined
610 passing yards instead of 810?

Or how about quarterbacks calling their own plays?

Talk about your football throwbacks.

Wouldn't that be fun? Quarterbacks called their own plays for 100 years, and
today's quarterbacks are far more football-savvy than the QBs of yesteryear.

Stoops didn't even reject that idea.

Said he could live with quarterbacks calling their own plays, so long as he had
a quarterback like Bradford.

"I think that'd be exciting," Stoops said.

The 30-second clock is like basketball's shot clock. Of course football teams
could adjust to it. Remember when college hoops first went to a shot clock, a
45-second clock? That would be insufferable now.

Same with the 30-second clock in football.

Alabama basketball: Johnson cuts down playbook to speed up offense

BYLINE: Tony Tsoukalas, The Anniston Star, Ala.

SECTION: SPORTS

LENGTH: 891 words


Jan. 02--TUSCALOOSA -- Needing to jump start his offense, Alabama head
basketball coach Avery Johnson first let go of the brakes.

Johnson attributed much of his team's slow start on offense this season to his
players' reliance on him while they headed down the floor. Rather than sprinting
down the court, Johnson noticed his players' heads were immediately turning to
him on every possession.

Following the Crimson Tide's win over Arkansas State in Huntsville, Johnson said
he scrapped about half of his team's playbook, simplifying the offense and
allowing his players to move more freely up the court. So far, the streamlined
approach has worked well for the Tide.

"They're not looking at me," Johnson said. "In some of those games, whether it
was at Oregon or at Texas, 30 times a game they were looking at me and ruining
our fast-break opportunities. I just think they are taking more responsibility."

Alabama (7-5) is riding a two-game winning streak into its SEC opener against
Mississippi State (9-3) on Tuesday at 7:30 p.m. in Starkville, Miss. The Tide
heads into the matchup coming off one of its better offensive performances of
the season, an 83-60 win over Stetson that saw Alabama record a season high in
points. In that game, Alabama tallied 12 fast-break points, capitalizing on
quick trips down the court.

"Sometimes your best offense is going against a defense that is not set,"
Johnson said. "If we can get out and run a little bit more, and now they
understand the progressions of early offense, secondary offense, where we don't
have to stop and just call plays every single time. We think that seems to help
us and also build more confidence in them that they can just play basketball and
feel a lot freer on the court."

The new offensive attack began with what Johnson called a "quarterbacks meeting"
with guards Dazon Ingram, Corban Collins and Avery Johnson Jr. Looking to create
more responsibility among his players, the head coach took away some of the
"handcuffs" players felt they had and challenged them to trust themselves more
on the court.

"We've had those conversations in terms of trying to find an offensive
identity," Johnson said. "I'm just giving them more freedom to express
themselves out on the floor. Then if we get stuck, they have a list of plays
calls or situations of how we want to attack based on our opponent."

The Tide's go-to "quarterback" lately has been Ingram, who recorded his first
double-double of the season against Stetson. The redshirt freshman guard made 6
of 9 for 16 points while tallying 10 rebounds and four assists in the game.
During the Tide's past two games, he has combined to shoot 60 percent from the
court while averaging 13 points a game.

"I think for him, the main thing is to continue to be more vocal, keep his
confidence at a high level and stay on the attack," Johnson said. "If he can
just stay aggressive, if he doesn't play on his heels, he's a really terrific
player."

Ingram is tied with freshman forward Braxton Key for the team lead in points a
game with 9.7 and leads the Tide with 3.8 assists and 1.2 steals a game. Tuesday
he will be matched up against Mississippi State guard Quinndary Weatherspoon,
who leads the Bulldogs, averaging 19.1 points a game this season. Ingram said he
remembers going up against Weatherspoon during the Alabama-Mississippi All-Star
Game coming out of high school and knows he's in for a challenge.

"He's gotten a lot better since high school," Ingram said with a smile. "He's an
all-around player. He can shoot the ball, he can drive it, he can get his
teammates involved. He's a good player."

Johnson gives update on injured players

Johnson provided an update on injured forward Nick King (lung infection) and
Collins (groin) on Tuesday.

During an SEC teleconference with reporters, Johnson said King has been "totally
inactive" for more than a month after developing a lung infection on the Tide's
trip to Las Vegas earlier in the season. The condition caused King to experience
severe weight loss, as he dropped 15 pounds in the span of seven days. King has
missed the Tide's past five games.

While there is no timetable for King's return, Johnson said the forward is back
with the team and is able to lightly ride the stationary back while he gets his
strength back. Johnson said the team plans to evaluate King in about two or
three weeks to see if he is ready to begin practice and will proceed from there.

"The players really like Nick King," Johnson said. "Him not being around, he's a
big part of our team. When you have a serious lung infection, obviously we know
that can be very deadly. We're taking all the precautions to make sure he can
get back to 100 percent, not just to help us on the court, but for a way of
life."

Johnson also gave an update on Collins, who injured his groin during the game
against Clemson on Dec. 18. Johnson said Collins took part in a small portion of
the Tide's practice on Sunday and said the graduate transfer was on a "pitch
count" for the workout. Johnson said Collins could again have a small role in
practice Monday and listed him as day-to-day for Tuesday's game against
Mississippi State.

Morris Brown tries to surprise

Morris Brown first-year coach Joe Crosby can understand why his peers are among
several groups of pollsters who picked the Wolverines to finish last in the
10-team Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Conference.

"When you consider that we were 0-10 last year, and got only nine or so starters
back, it's easy to see why people picked us to finish dead last in the
conference," Crosby said. "But I'm convinced we're going to have a pretty good
football team come Sept. 1."

On Sunday, Sept. 1, Morris Brown plays Mississippi Valley State in the second
game of a doubleheader at the Georgia Dome.

Under former coach Joe Redmond, the Wolverines did win one game on the field in
'95 - a 21-19 victory over Tuskegee. But because Redmond used ineligible
players, that win vanished - much like Redmond did at the end of his lone season
as Morris Brown's coach.

Crosby, out of football a year after posting a two-season record of 13-6-2 at
Savannah State, will have the luxury of coaching in a brand new facility as of
Sept. 21, when Fort Valley State comes Herndon Stadium. In the meantime, he
hopes to fashion a product long-suffering Wolverines supporters can learn to
love and appreciate.

"We're going to run the ball," Crosby said. "I've always felt that in order to
be successful, you have to be able to run, and stop the run. And with a young
team like we'll have, it's going to be important to control the ball."

From the outset, Crosby will put offensive matters in the hands of quarterbacks
Tony Slaton and Keevin Bell, two Atlantans who got an almost equal number of
repetitions in spring practice. Slaton, a 5-10, 180-pound junior, logged most
the playing time at that position last season - passing for 762 yards.

Six tailbacks are competing for the starting spot, including junior Dennis Mack
(5-8, 200) and sophomore Nate Wright (5-10, 190), two of several transfers from
Savannah State. Senior Cedric Marshall (5-11, 240) and sophomore Henry Burdge
(5-11, 230) return at fullback.

In whatever passing package Crosby employs, there will be some talented
receivers, including tight end Jerontee Jackson, Savannah State transfer Larry
Perrymond, and Corry Withers, a fifth-year senior who led the team in receptions
prior to sitting out last year for failing to accumulate enough academic
credits.

Unlike their offensive line, the Wolverines will have some depth in their
defensive interior - although it's unproven.

"We've got some good athletes over there," Crosby said. "In order to stop
somebody, you've got to be strong in the defensive line, and that's what we
tried to recruit - some strong athletes who can run. Of course our secondary
will be our strength."

That is because starting cornerbacks Roosevelt Blackmon and Tramel Gilmore
return, and Florida transfer Cedrick Evans has emerged as a possible star at
safety. While Blackmon led the team in interceptions the past two season,
Gilmore, a sophomore out of South DeKalb High, led the SIAC in kick returns
(24.1 yards per return.)

"With a new stadium, comes some big expectations," Crosby said. "But with a
young team, all I can guarantee is that we will be well conditioned, and we will
be well disciplined."

Offense could be key for MSSU baseball

BYLINE: Anvil Welch, The Joplin Globe, Mo.

SECTION: SPORTS

LENGTH: 403 words


Feb. 08--The Missouri Southern offense could be downright offensive.

Lions coach Bryce Darnell, although naturally cautious, doesn't totally
disagree.

"We believe it's a good offense," Darnell said Friday. "We just hope people
perform like we believe they're capable of playing.

"This team certainly has the potential to be as good on offense as we've been in
the last few years," Darnell said. "We have a lot of people returning on offense
.

"Power? I don't know about that. But we have several players capable of gap
power."

The Lions averaged .310 last season in finishing 32-19 overall and 23-17 in the
MIAA.

The Lions open their baseball season today with an 11:45 a.m. doubleheader in
Minneapolis in the Metrodome against Montana State-Billings.

Darnell has tapped Brett Abell, a senior left-hander from Miami, to start the
opener.

Darnell said the probable top four in the Lions' batting order will consist of
senior second baseman Michael McCoy, senior left fielder Dallas Burke, senior
right fielder Nick Doughty and senior third baseman Sam Ryan.

Darnell said first baseman Shaun Hoover, a senior, will hit fifth. Junior Tee
Helsel or senior Will Wagner will be the designated hitter.

Completing the probable order will be senior center fielder Dane Kolkmeyer,
junior catcher Mitchell Osburn and senior shortstop Thomas Wilson.

"Burke is an added jolt to our offense," Darnell said of the University of Iowa
transfer who missed 2012 with a shoulder injury. "He's a proven hitter."

The left-handed swinging Burke averaged nearly .400 in earning all-conference
honors in 2011.

The right-handed batting McCoy paced the Lions last season with a .375 average
on 69 of 184. He also was No. 1 with those hits, 45 runs batted in and a .421
on-base percentage.

Ryan, who averaged .312, had the most home runs (8), drove in 42 runs and had
the No. 1 slugging percentage (.558).

Helsel, Kolkmeyer and Wilson posted respective averages of .289, .279 and .277.
Helsel, the team co-leader with 14, Kolkmeyer and McCoy combined for 37 doubles.

Southern will play two more seven-inning games at 7 a.m. on Sunday against
Montana State-Billings.

"It will be a typical pitch count," Darnell said of the starting hurlers. "Game
situations will dictate pitching moves. Our pitchers are in game condition."

Spreading the Word West Coast offense looks Super again

BYLINE: By John Henderson, Denver Post Sports Writer

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. I-07

LENGTH: 909 words

SAN DIEGO - It was as big a part of the 1980s sports landscape as salary
arbitration, steroids and Michael Jordan. And like that venerable trio, the
NFL's West Coast offense is still around. You just don't hear about it much
anymore.

But it's kind of like your hotshot cousin who was so impressive as a kid. He
grew up, and so has the West Coast offense.

For a review of the controlled, short-yardage passing offense that changed the
face of football, tune in at 4:18 p.m. MST today when Denver (15-4) faces Green
Bay (15-3) in Super Bowl XXXII. In fact, you've been seeing the West Coast
offense this entire decade. You just don't recognize it.

Trust us. It's around, and it's better than ever.

"There's no question, it's the offense of the times right now," Packers
offensive coordinator Sherm Lewis said. "Teams are copying it. We're all
copycats."

That's why you'll see both teams today occasionally run four wide receivers and
operate out of the I formation with the fullback in front of the tailback.
They're all evolutionary twists to an offense designed to control the ball with
quick, short passes, emphasizing the three- and four-step quarterback drop
rather than the seven-step drop.

Bill Walsh developed the offense while an assistant coach with the Cincinnati
Bengals and took it to San Francisco, where he won four world titles in the
1980s. Since then, Walsh disciples such as Denver coach Mike Shanahan and Green
Bay's Mike Holmgren have spread the offense through the NFL.

Counting the 49ers, three of the four teams in the conference championships ran
the West Coast offense. Ex-49er Ray Rhodes also runs it in Philadelphia. And if
his assistant, Jon Gruden, gets hired in Oakland, the offense will be on both
sides of the bay.

If teams don't run it, they run parts of it. That's how much it has evolved.
It's evolved so much it's become more of a global offense than a West Coast
offense.

"I'm not sure what that term means," Shanahan said. "Ask anyone for a definition
of the West Coast offense and they'll give you a different answer. It's really
(attributed to) anyone who's been in the 49ers program who has gone to another
program and had success with it."

When they do leave the San Francisco nest, they add their own personality. Many
fans think the West Coast offense went the way of slam dancing, but it merely
changed its face. The NFL's trend in the 1990s is a power running game, yet that
running game has roots in the West Coast attack. Denver's Terrell Davis and
Green Bay's Dorsey Levens both gained at least 1,400 yards for West Coast
offense teams.

"That's a general term," Green Bay defensive coordinator Fritz Shurmur said. "A
lot of people are lining up in the I formation. They're doing things in the
power running game with the multiple tight ends, and open formations.

"Most of these clubs gravitated from a high emphasis on pass to more trying to
get the running game established. I always thought when we played against those
great 49er teams that their whole idea was to start with the passing game, and
when you're forced to defend with more people out of the box than normally, then
they'd pump the run at you."

Added Lewis: "We're looking at more four-wide-receivers (sets) than we used to.
We go with three wide receivers. We run more screens than we used to. We run out
of the I more than we ever did. Every year we change it and we change it
determined by personnel."

Take Green Bay. Holmgren, like Shanahan a former 49ers offensive coordinator,
has a balanced attack. Besides Levens, he has five receivers with at least 38
catches. No wonder quarterback Brett Favre has been league MVP the last three
years.

"This is an offense designed around Brett Favre," Denver defensive coordinator
Greg Robinson said. "Do they do a lot of the same things that Joe Montana did
and Steve Young did at San Francisco? Yeah. But it's evolved into being more
than that."

What makes the offense so tough? It uses the whole field and the whole lineup.
In the 1960s, the NFL was dominated by power running backs. In the 1980s, great
passing combinations ruled. The modern West Coast offense doesn't emphasize one
player.

Denver reserve running back Derek Loville caught 87 passes for the 49ers two
years ago. Broncos tight end Shannon Sharpe has had his three best years since
Shanahan arrived in 1995.

"Usually when it's good, it's because it's taken advantage of a lot of weapons,"
Robinson said. "When you're talking about (Green Bay's Antonio) Freeman, you're
talking about (Mark) Chmura, you're talking about (Robert) Brooks, you're
talking about (William) Henderson, you're talking about Levens. You look at how
that ball, just in the passing game, is spread all over the field.

"That's balance. It's balance that creates problems for a defense."

OK, if the West Coast offense is still pro football's version of the Patriot
Missle, why isn't every team using it? Only four have made full-scale
commitments to it.

Here's a hint: Look at the quarterbacks involved. They include John Elway, Steve
Young and Favre. How many Elways, Youngs and Favres are around? How many are
developing?

Case closed.

"The system is quarterback-friendly, but there's a tremendous burden on the
quarterback," Holmgren said. "You'd better have a good quarterback. If you
don't, this system is like any other system. It doesn't work very well."

And it has worked for a long time. You just didn't recognize it.

ESPN analyst believes Callahan's pr ooffense will work at Nebraska

LENGTH: 551 words

DATELINE: Lincoln, NE


Nebraska fans leery of the Huskers' move toward a pro-style, spread offensive
attack under new coach Bill Callahan will like what Chris Mortensen has to say
on the matter.

Mortensen, an ESPN analyst, knows his NFL X's and O's as well anyone, and he
thinks Callahan's philosophy will work in Lincoln.

For starters, "one thing he's either going to maintain or enhance is Nebraska is
going to be a physical football team," Mortensen said Friday. "Bill is an old
offensive line coach."

In his first season as the Oakland Raiders' coach, Callahan ended up in the
Super Bowl. The Raiders led the NFL, averaging 389.8 yards of offense per game.

Oakland followed that this season by stumbling to a 4-12 record. With a number
of offensive starters ending up on the injured-reserve list, the Raiders slid to
25th in total offense.

Mortensen said Oakland got away from a physical style this season, but that
Callahan will find that easy to return to coaching at a school like Nebraska
that has had a run-first mentality.

What Husker fans will notice more is how the quarterback functions in Callahan's
version of the West Coast offense.

"You'll see a pro-style offense and he'll obviously game plan accordingly on a
week-to-week basis," Mortensen said. "But he understands how important it is to
coach the quarterback. That's the key to the West Coast offense."

Mortensen then noted a conversation he had with former Super Bowl MVP
quarterback Steve Young on Thursday.

"The offense is fully adaptable to the skills of the quarterback," he said.
"Mike Shanahan tweaks it for Jake Plummer (in Denver). It was tweaked for Jeff
Garcia (in San Francisco), because he's not a 1-2-3-step dropback passer.
(Atlanta's)Michael Vick is different.

"The West Coast offense has evolved many times over, it is fully adaptable."

Mortensen sounded sure Callahan will be heavily involved in play calling.

He also said Nebraska will be out to recruit tall receivers.

As for the Huskers' quarterback prospects? Mortensen said the committed D.T.
McDowell will be a good fit.

"That guy has a terrific arm."

If so, that would give the Huskers a completely different image than what
existed the past two seasons with Jammal Lord pulling the trigger.

"Ithink there's a perception that their time has passed," Mortensen said of
Nebraska's option-oriented attack. "That doesn't mean Nebraska football's time
has passed, necessarily. But in terms of the offense, people feel like they were
behind."

Callahan said his offense will be predicated on matchup factors, weather factors
and also the Huskers' talent strengths.

The goal will be to "attack every area of the field through the run and the
pass. It'll be a process."

Mortensen, though, believes it'll end up being enjoyable.

"He's going to have a fun time dealing with players after dealing with the jerks
he was dealing with," he said, referring to some high-profile Oakland players
who recently spoke out against Callahan.

Apparently, the discontent over Callahan fell on deaf ears among NFLcoaches.
According to Mortensen, Callahan had plenty of options to remain in the league.

"When guys like (New York Giants coach)Tom Coughlin and (Tampa Bay coach)Jon
Gruden want to hire you... that should speak volumes of Bill's credibility,"
Mortensen said.

QB search key to Huskers' try for a hat trick;
The first consensus national champion to repeat in four decades just might win
three in a row.

BYLINE: Mark Schlabach; STAFF WRITER

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 10C

LENGTH: 799 words


Notre Dame and Alabama have won more national championships. Michigan and Texas
have better all-time winning percentages. But only Nebraska has a shot at
becoming college football's first-ever three-peat winner.

If you believe the preseason college football magazines, that's exactly what the
Cornhuskers will do this fall even though they're playing in probably the
nation's toughest conference and have lost tailback Lawrence Phillips and
Heisman Trophy runner-up Tommie Frazier from last season's team.

Nebraska, which enters its inaugural Big 12 season with a 25-game winning
streak, received the most votes in the Atlanta Journal- Constitution's annual
composite poll of preseason college football magazines. The Big Red Machine
received 164 points, three more than No. 2 Florida State. A pair of SEC teams,
Tennessee and Florida, finished third and fourth, respectively. Colorado, which
closed last season with four straight wins, finished fifth.

Do the defending champs have enough firepower left to give coach Tom Osborne his
third straight title? Can Colorado unseat the Cornhuskers for the first-ever Big
12 Conference championship in coach Rick Neuheisel's second season at the helm?
Will the Big 12 overtake the SEC as the nation's premier league?

Those questions will begin to be answered when the college football season kicks
off in less than a month. Prognosticators agree on one thing: It's going to be a
wide-open race to New Orleans on New Year's Day for the second Bowl Alliance
national-title game in the Sugar Bowl.

After becoming the first consensus national champ to repeat in four decades,
Nebraska's quest for a third consecutive title may be easier if Osborne can find
a quarterback. There are plenty of reasons for Cornhusker fans to be optimistic.
The schedule is again favorable with the lone serious roadblock, Colorado,
traveling to Lincoln for the regular season finale on Nov. 29. The Cornhuskers
return 12 starters, including sophomore sensation Ahman Green, who led the team
in rushing last season.

The Cornhuskers' only question mark is at quarterback. Osborne lost the 1-2
punch of Frazier and Brook Berringer, but senior Matt Turman and Stanford
transfer Scott Frost are both capabale passers behind the Cornhuskers' trademark
offensive line. The defense, which leveled Florida in last year's Fiesta Bowl,
will again be led by All-America defensive ends Jared Tomich and Grant Wistrom.

"Naturally, everybody's chasing Nebraska," Tennessee coach Phillip Fulmer said.

While Nebraska's key is finding the right player behind the center, three teams
hope to end the Cornhuskers' dominance with explosive quarterbacks. Tennessee
has Heisman Trophy favorite Peyton Manning, but the Volunteers have plenty of
holes to fill on the offensive line. Tennessee's schedule is also less
attractive, with home games against UCLA, Florida and Alabama. There's also a
road date in Athens on Oct. 12. But Tennessee fans expect nothing less than a
national title this year.

"There are big expectations at Tennessee and that's good," said Fulmer. "We're
not in the business of avoiding that kind of pressure at all. But we've got a
lot of work to do to meet those expectations. As an example, if you draw up a
national championship team, you'd have five fifth-year seniors on the offensive
line. We don't have any."

Tennessee's biggest test will likely come in a home game against Florida on
Sept. 21. After the Cornhuskers embarrassed Florida for the national title last
season, Gators coach Steve Spurrier finally realized what everyone else has
known for years: defense wins championships. Spurrier's offense will again be
potent with quarterback Danny Wuerffel, and the defense should improve under new
coordinator Bob Stoops, who directed Kansas State's top-ranked unit last season.

"We're excited about the 4-3 defense that Bob Stoops and his staff started to
install this spring," said Spurrier. "They're in the learning and development
procedure now, but they showed a lot of improvement in the spring."

Florida's biggest obstacle is that it may have the toughest schedule among the
top 5 teams. Besides the trip to Knoxville, the Gators also play two consecutive
home games against SEC foes LSU, which should be greatly improved, and Auburn,
in addition to its contest with Georgia, which returns to Jacksonville on Nov.
2. There's also the in-state battle with Florida State on Nov. 30.

The Seminoles, who had their ninth consecutive 10-win season last year at 10-2,
could also contend for a trip to New Orleans. Coach Bobby Bowden's first task
will be to decide between junior Thad Busby and redshirt freshman Dan Kendra at
quarterback. Running back Warrick Dunn should be in the Heisman hunt if FSU can
rebuild its offensive line.

BULLDOGS PREVIEW;
Dogs need to resolve quarterback question

LENGTH: 612 words

DATELINE: Athens


Imagine Georgia coach Jim Donnan's surprise last week when his telephone was
ringing off the hook and his mailbox was stuffed with letters from concerned
Bulldogs fans, who didn't like the team's performance in a recent preseason
scrimmage.

Welcome to the fickle world of Georgia football.

Last season, Donnan guided the Bulldogs to one of college football's biggest
turnarounds: a 10-2 record, a No. 10 national ranking and a 33-6 demolition of
Wisconsin in the Outback Bowl. Now, he faces one of the nation's largest
rebuilding jobs in his third season in Athens.

The Bulldogs actually may have more talent than they did last year, with the
addition of one of the nation's best recruiting classes. But some of that youth
will be counted on at key positions --- quarterback, wide receiver and
linebacker.

Donnan also won't have the luxury of opening this season with four straight home
games like last year, when the Bulldogs stormed to a 4-0 record before losing at
Tennessee. But Georgia's early schedule still seems favorable, with Kent
(13-74-1 record in 1990s) and Wyoming traveling to Athens and the SEC opener at
South Carolina sandwiched between those cream puffs.

Georgia's season probably will be decided in October, when the Bulldogs travel
to LSU and Kentucky, host Tennessee and Vanderbilt and face high-powered Florida
in Jacksonville. Georgia probably needs to win three of the five games to keep
its major-bowl hopes alive. The final three games --- Auburn on the road and Ole
Miss and Georgia Tech at home --- all are potential stumbling blocks. OFFENSIVE
STRENGTHS

Georgia returns a quality stable of backs in seniors Olandis Gary and Ronnie
Bradley, juniors Patrick Pass and Robert Arnaud and freshman Jasper Sanks.
They'll run behind a good offensive line, which is led by the nation's top pair
of tackles in Matt Stinchcomb and Chris Terry. The Bulldogs may have the SEC's
best set of tight ends in Larry Brown and Jermaine Wiggins. OFFENSIVE WEAKNESSES

There's essentially no experience at quarterback, where junior Jon England and
freshman Quincy Carter probably will battle for the starting job into the final
days of the preseason. Whoever starts needs to avoid costly mistakes. The middle
of the offensive line is unproven, as is depth at wide receiver. DEFENSIVE
STRENGTHS

Georgia returns arguably its best defensive front since the Junkyard Dogs of the
early 1980s. Ends Antonio Cochran (if healthy) and Marcus Stroud and nose guard
Emarlos Leroy all eventually may play on Sundays. Tackles Paul Snellings and
Brandon Miller are major cogs in the middle. There's plenty of depth in the
secondary, where All-America candidate Champ Bailey runs the show at cornerback.
DEFENSIVE WEAKNESSES

There's little experience or depth at linebacker, where junior Orantes Grant is
the only returning starter. Sophomore Adrian Hollingshed is solid in the middle,
but Boss Bailey and William Witherspoon, both highly regarded freshmen, will be
counted on heavily on the outside. KEYS TO SUCCESS

Donnan must settle on a starting quarterback and hope that his running game can
bear much of the offensive load early. The kicking game needs to be vastly
improved. Georgia also must learn to play in the big games. It got a taste of
success in last season's upset of Florida, but it must do it on a consistent
basis for the program to make the next step. SURE SIGN OF TROUBLE

Donnan is hoping to avoid the turnovers and miscues that plagued his rookie
campaign at Georgia in 1996. With an unproven quarterback, that might be a tough
feat to accomplish. A loss at South Carolina would probably be devastating to
this young team.

D.C. Tops States in Arrests for Weapon Offenses, U.S. Says

Ruben Castaneda, Washington Post Staff Writer

SECTION: METRO; Pg. C03

LENGTH: 529 words


The District had a higher arrest rate for weapon offenses than any of the 50
states, according to a report released yesterday by the Department of Justice.

The report also found that nationally, the total number of arrests for weapon
violations has increased 54 percent since 1974, while arrests for all crimes
rose 55 percent. Also, the number of juveniles arrested for weapon offenses has
skyrocketed, the study said.

The report, compiled by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, an arm of the Justice
Department, studied weapon violations nationwide in 1993.

Criminal justice analysts said it is unfair to compare the District, an urban
city, with states that have large rural and suburban areas. Cities are bound to
have more incidences of violent crime and higher rates of weapon violations,
they said.

The report found that 81 percent of all weapon offenses in 1993 occurred in
urban areas.

It found that the District had a rate of 301 weapon offenses per 100,000
residents. The second-highest jurisdiction, Missouri, had 199 weapon offenses
per 100,000 residents. Rounding out the top five were Wisconsin, with 165;
Georgia, 149; and Louisiana, 142.

The five states with the lowest rates were North Dakota, 25; Maine, 23; New
Hampshire, 16; Montana, 12; and Vermont, 1.

Weapon violations include illegally possessing, using, trafficking, carrying,
manufacturing or exporting deadly devices such as handguns, long guns,
ammunition, explosives, silencers and some types of knives.

Suspects charged with violent crimes, such as murder or assault with intent to
kill, often also are charged with weapon violations.

Overall in 1993, local and state law enforcement officers made an estimated
262,300 arrests in which a weapon offense was the most serious charge, the
report said. From 1974 to 1993, the number of violent crimes -- murder, robbery
and aggravated assault -- committed with firearms increased 78 percent, the
study said.

Increasingly, young people, almost always teenage boys, are being arrested on
weapon charges, the study found.

From 1985 to 1993, the number of juvenile arrests for weapon offenses more than
doubled, from 30,000 to more than 61,000, the report said. During the same time,
adult arrests grew by 33 percent.

With few exceptions, it is illegal for anyone other than sworn law enforcement
officers to possess a handgun in the District.

Almost 6,000 guns were seized in the District last year; most were discovered
during the course of an arrest or investigation of another crime.

About five months ago, D.C. police and federal officials launched "Operation
Ceasefire," an effort to get guns off the streets of Washington.

Teams of police officers and federal agents were set up to work in six of the
city's seven police districts. There is no gun seizure squad in the 2nd Police
District, which includes Georgetown and upper-middle-class residential areas in
upper Northwest Washington, neighborhoods with low rates of violent crime.

The gun seizure squads confiscated 282 firearms, including 127 handguns, during
the program's first four months, officials said at a D.C. Council hearing last
month.

NATION IN BRIEF;
Freemen neighbors pressure FBI

BYLINE: From our news services

SECTION: NATIONAL NEWS; Pg. 06A

LENGTH: 762 words


The FBI is squeezing the Montana Freemen ever tighter since surrender talks
broke down, but residents of this ranching and farming county are doing some
squeezing of their own - on the FBI. A community petition urging the use of
"reasonable force" to end the 73-day-old standoff has collected some 200
signatures, rancher Brent McRae, who initiated it, said Wednesday. The county
has fewer than 1,500 residents, and Jordan has fewer than 500.

McRae said he would deliver the petition to Garfield County Sheriff Charles
Phipps today and hold a news conference to comment on attitudes he found in
circulating the document. He wants Phipps to deliver it to the FBI.

FIRES Wilderness blaze

Nearly 1,000 people had been ordered out of their homes and a prison farm was
evacuated Wednesday as a forest fire swarmed through a sparse community of homes
built on wooded lots carved out of the Alaskan wilderness. Fire officials waited
on reinforcements from the Lower 48 states, and expected no rain before Sunday
at the earliest. The fire tripled in size from dawn to afternoon, burning about
37,000 acres.

MILITARY No court-martial

A top Naval Academy student accused of sexually assaulting four female
midshipmen will face a disciplinary hearing rather than a court- martial, the
academy said Wednesday. Capt. Tom Jurkowsky, an academy spokesman, said the
charges against Midshipman 1st Class Scott T. Ward were not backed up by enough
evidence to hold a court-martial, which is a criminal proceeding and can lead to
a prison sentence. Following the disciplinary hearing, the 21-year-old from
Grand Rapids, Mich., could face expulsion from the academy in Annapolis, Md. "We
had sort of been expecting this. It's good news," said Ward's lawyer, William
Cummings.

MEDIA Seems like old times

The Los Angeles Times has halved its street price to 25 cents throughout
Southern California to boost circulation. The paper had already charged 25 cents
in the competitive San Fernando Valley region of the city and in Orange County.
The new price, which went into effect Monday, dropped the cost from 50 cents to
25 cents in San Bernardino, Riverside, and Ventura counties and the balance of
Los Angeles County.

CRIME Beating viedotaped

Ryan Nokes of Omaha never fought back when an older boy jumped him in the
hallway of their high school and beat him so viciously it left broken bones in
his face and foot. There's no disputing it because a friend of the assailant
captured the attack on videotape, and is even heard egging him on, authorities
said. The videotape evidence led to the arrest Tuesday of Zachary Bornhoft, 16,
for suspicion of misdemeanor assault, and Johnny Tkaczuk, 16, for third- degree
assault. Both are in the custody of their parents, awaiting a court appearance
set for June 25.

Money laundering

No officer, that's not an ATM - it's a washing machine. That's what police in
Columbus, Ohio, said two suspects told them early Wednesday as they were caught
in a bank parking lot with a battered automated teller machine chained to their
car. Timothy E. Lebo, 39, of Obetz, and Charles J. Kinser, 32, of Columbus, were
charged with breaking and entering, safecracking and aggravated theft. Police
said they used the car to ram into a Star Bank building and jar the ATM loose,
then wrapped the chain around the bank machine and attached it to the rear of
their vehicle before trying to drive away.

Bizarre swan song

A dead puppy, cat and decapitated kitten were nailed to trees outside Troy High
School in Fullerton, Calif., as a gory prank to mark the end of the academic
year, and school officials vowed to punish those responsible. A 17-year-old
junior was arrested on suspicion of cruelty to animals, trespassing and
vandalism, police said. He admitted to stealing the carcasses from a
veterinarian's freezer and chopping off the kitten's head with an ax. Seven
others were questioned by detectives, and at least two more arrests were
expected, police said. The juniors involved will face expulsion and the seniors
will be barred from graduation ceremonies, said school superintendent J. Kenneth
Jones.

ETC. Early returns

Three-year-old Max Rosen isn't even old enough to collect an allowance, much
less pay income tax. The Internal Revenue Service sent him a refund check anyway
- for $ 219,495. Neil Rosen, a Pittsburgh lawyer, said he and his wife, Jan,
thought at first that the letter addressed to their son meant they had
miscalculated the taxes they had paid on savings held for their son.

Offense doing its job, but those DBs ...

BYLINE: Andy Graham, Herald-Times, Bloomington, Ind.

SECTION: SPORTS

LENGTH: 768 words


Nov. 21--Consider the following per-game averages, football fans:

30.3 points.

197.8 rushing yards.

233.5 passing yards.

431.3 total yards.

5.5 average gain per play.

That is what Indiana's Hoosiers have averaged against Ohio State, Michigan
State, Iowa and Michigan.

While going 0-4 in those games.

The Hoosiers lead the Big Ten in total offense at 467.5 yards per game. A truly
robust number.

But toss in the Rutgers debacle (in which the Hoosier offense scored a mere 52
points despite the absence of Jordan Howard) and the Penn State game (when the
Hoosier offense was bereft of both Howard and Nate Sudfeld), and IU is 0-6 in
league play heading into today's game at Maryland.

Maryland is also 0-6 in conference action and, like Indiana, has just concluded
a heavyweight stretch of Big Ten schedule, having faced Michigan, Ohio State,
Penn State, Iowa, Wisconsin and Michigan State consecutively.

The Terps, like Indiana, have played competitively while losing. Their problem,
unlike Indiana, has primarily been turnovers.

Indiana's primary problem remains defense.

More specifically: pass defense.

How did IU go 0-4 against those top 15 Big Ten foes, despite those good
offensive numbers? Here is what the Ohio State, Michigan State, Iowa and
Michigan offenses averaged against IU:

42.3 points.

197.3 rushing yards.

329.0 passing yards.

526.3 total yards.

6.9 yards per play.

The passing yardage is what really jumps out.

Even so, the Hoosiers have played competitively enough that each of their losses
against ranked opposition this season have come down to a play here or there.
Literally.

But Indiana's secondary, in addition to allowing gargantuan overall numbers to
the foe, is not making plays.

Just how Indiana and Michigan defenders played key fourth-down, game-on-the-line
sequences last Saturday provides a very instructive contrast.

At the end of regulation, with Michigan down 34-27 and facing a fourth-and-goal
at the IU 5, the Wolverines deployed in a double-slot formation that provided
them some favorable matchups.

Standout tight end Jake Butt was the the right slot. Big wideout Jehu Chesson
lined up in the left slot. This pretty much guaranteed that at least one would
be covered by a safety. As it turned out, both were.

Chase Dutra, IU's most experienced safety, lined up to take the tight end. Tony
Fields lined up opposite Chesson. They were in man coverage, as were the
Hoosiers across the board, with the exception of Jonathan Crawford being allowed
to roam as a "centerfielder" free safety. Crawford shaded over a bit toward
Butt, which was a rational approach.

But Fields did two things he absolutely could not afford to do when the ball was
snapped. Fields' first move, fatally, was to back up instead of pressing
coverage. Fields' other mistake is that he let Chesson get inside him. That
should never happen at or near the goal line, even if there is potential safety
help inside.

As a result, all Chesson had to do was make a brief faint toward the outside,
curl inside and catch the ball unmolested.

Compare that to how Michigan junior safety Delano Hill played against IU slot
receiver Mitchell Paige when the Hoosiers had their do-or-die fourth down pass
in the second overtime. Hill met Paige right at the goal line and was in
position to rake away a well-thrown pass.

Ballgame. And the difference between winning and losing.

There was a timeout before that Michigan TD at the end of regulation time. So
there was time for IU's defensive coaches to remind their players of how they
needed to contest the upcoming play. But either the players didn't know how to
contest it, or they didn't act upon it. Either way, it's an issue.

Not an issue. The issue.

Indiana plays a Maryland team today that normally doesn't pass the ball very
successfully. Terps QB Perry Hills has connected on just 50 percent of his
passes and has thrown more picks (12) than TDs (eight). But he also leads
Maryland's rushing with a 5.0 average per gain and the Hoosiers will have to
step up to stop Hills' read-option runs. And they will have to make Hills try to
beat them through the air.

But the problem for Indiana has been that forcing foes into passing situations
actually seems a disadvantage for IU.

That has to change today. And if the game is on the line at the end, the
secondary must make the play.

It hasn't for the better part of two months now. Which is why IU, in the context
of all those pretty offensive numbers, fights for its bowl-bid life today.

WVU's rise in the polls began;
with a meeting in Stillwater, Okla.

BYLINE: Mitch Vingle

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. P1B

LENGTH: 1023 words


IF YOU'RE A West Virginia University football fan, you've been absolutely
bathing in new and wonderful experiences this season.

There's the new conference. The victory at Texas. The Heisman Trophy
front-runner in Geno Smith. There's the coach, Dana Holgorsen, who is up for the
Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award.

And Mountaineer athletic director Oliver Luck remembers how it was all hatched -
from a meeting in a Stillwater, Okla., hotel conference room.

"I distinctly remember I was out west for one of my son's games at Stanford,"
Luck said. "I flew to Kansas City for a Jerry West Hall of Fame induction and,
afterward, around 8 o'clock, I made the four-hour drive to Stillwater. The next
day we met."

Luck, that is, and Holgorsen, then the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks
coach at Oklahoma State.

"Dana carved out four or five hours," Luck said, "and we sat in that conference
room and talked a lot of football, a lot of theory."

Luck is fluent in football. He's a former WVU and NFL quarterback. The NFL
trusted him to work their overseas operations of NFL Europe. Yet on that 2010
day, newly charged with reviving West Virginia's athletic program, Luck was on a
quest: improve the Mountaineer football program.

"I operated from a couple of tenets," Luck said. "I realized we needed to
improve our offense. I'm a big believer in offense ... In college ball, offense
is crucial and that's what people want to see and will pay to watch."

Luck had lived in Texas for many years, first while as a Houston Oilers
quarterback then as a law student at the University of Texas. Later, he was the
president of Major League Soccer's Houston Dynamos. All the while, his son,
Andrew, now guiding the Indianapolis Colts, was moving through the ranks in the
Lone Star State.

"Spending time in Texas, I watched Andrew first in middle school and then high
school," Luck said. "I saw the training, the 7-on-7 camps, how important offense
was. I mean, think of the skill in that [WVU-]Baylor game. With all those passes
thrown, there was one dropped pass. That's incredible. And at that time, that's
what I was looking for.

"As I analyzed our program, I saw we were ranked No. 60 or 70 nationally. You
can't win conference championships - I don't care what conference you're in -
unless you are somewhere in the top 10 in offense."

WVU finished the 2010 season ranked No. 67 in total offense, averaging 372.7
yards. Today, the Mountaineers are No. 3 nationally, averaging 570.8 yards, and
are ranked No. 4 in the USA Today coaches poll and No. 5 in the Associated Press
poll.

"My thought was we needed someone who could teach offense, who could coach
offense," Luck said. "My thought was the Hal Mumme, Mike Leach, Art Briles type
of offense would be very hard for Big East teams to stop. And the name at the
top of my list was Dana."

The two hadn't met, however, until that day in late 2010. Although Luck had been
in the soccer business until taking over at WVU, he continued to follow and stay
involved in football.

"I knew in my heart of hearts Dana could move our offense," Luck said. "My
question was, could he be a head coach? Well, I had a relationship with both
[former Holgorsen bosses] Mike Leach and Kevin Sumlin, two guys I admire
greatly. They both told me, 'He's ready; he's absolutely ready.'"

Then came the meeting, the face-to-face, in that Stillwater room.

"I didn't really talk personnel to Dana," Luck said. "I knew because of his
coaching connections that he could make one phone call and find out about our
players.

"So I explained what kind of opportunity we had. I told him we might have a
small state, but we have a deep and passionate fan base. I told him we have a
fan base with a chip on its shoulder. Seems we always have to punch above our
weight. We're the southernmost northern school and the northernmost southern
school. I told him, unlike some of the schools in Texas, we're No. 1 in our
state.

"I told him about our facilities, [basketball coach Bob Huggins] and all we have
to offer. I told him people will rally around you like you've never seen."

Especially when you win. And especially when you win like Holgorsen.

Luck recalled he didn't try to oversell WVU to Holgorsen during that meeting.

"I was trying to be upfront with him about the opportunity," said the athletic
director. "I knew he was blunt within two minutes of meeting him. I was
explaining the opportunity and he was trying to understand. I think he
appreciated that I was a football guy."

Luck said Holgorsen was invited to see WVU's facilities and, about a week later,
flew into Pittsburgh, where Luck picked him up. The athletic director drove
Holgorsen to Morgantown, gave him a tour and introduced him to school president
Jim Clements.

Thankfully, Luck admitted, Morgantown has changed since he played and was
graduated.

"You couldn't have done this back then," Luck said. "People talk about
infrastructure that's built to attract athletes. It is. But it matters for
coaches too."

Soon, the deal was completed. Holgorsen was put in place to follow head coach
Bill Stewart, who was subsequently removed before tragically passing away at age
59.

Now, in Holgorsen's second year as head coach, the Mountaineer season has been
wildly successful so far. WVU football has never received so much national
attention. Smith is a solid Heisman front-runner and possible No. 1 NFL draft
pick.

"I had a coach in high school," Luck said, "that taught me to envision making
great plays, whether they be free throws or that post pattern. You not only
train your body, but your mind.

"In football, I was limited, so I did that. I continue to do that. I did that
with the NFL in Europe. I did that with soccer. I'm doing that now."

One has to wonder, however, whether Luck's visions could ever have covered all
that's happening now with WVU's football program.

"I'm not going to answer that," Luck said. "But I will tell you I spend most of
my time thinking how things can be, as opposed to why things can't be."

It's a system that's working beautifully for WVU's football program.

PRO FOOTBALL;
Giants Offense Starts to Hold Its Own

BYLINE: By THOMAS GEORGE

SECTION: Section D; Page 2; Column 1; Sports Desk

LENGTH: 919 words

DATELINE: ALBANY, Aug. 15


The Giants in recent seasons have avoided a potentially destructive situation:
becoming divided, two teams within one. Offense over here. Defense over there.
The Giants' offense, basically, has stunk. The Giants' defense has been the
team's backbone.

Through the adversity, amazingly, the two meshed. And remained one.

But that did not hide the frustration. The body language of the Giants'
defensive players and sometimes, simply, their language, revealed their ire.
Occasionally they were critical of their unproductive teammates. Frequently it
was evident that the defense believed hope was lost.

"We've had games where our defense was on the field for 100 plays; man, that's
two games in one," Jessie Armstead, the Giants' All-Pro linebacker, said today.
"Any coach who tries to say you can win that way is lying, and he knows he's
lying. We'd get interceptions or some kind of turnover and then the offense
would go one, two, three plays and then we're back on the field again. We'd
start to ask the offense, 'Can you get one first down?'

"We're lucky it didn't spill over and get real nasty. The attitude on offense
has been that they get punched and then they shut it down. Now it looks like we
can punch 'em back."

Or even offer the first lick.

That is the promise of the Giants' 36-21 defeat of Minnesota on Friday night. As
the Giants continued training camp at SUNY-Albany today and prepared for this
Saturday's home matchup against Jacksonville, there was a genuine feeling of
relief and unity among them. And great hope that this Giants offense is finally
ready to carry its share of the load.

Maybe even lead.

"There is no question that our defense has earned our bacon a lot of the time,"
the fifth-year offensive tackle Scott Gragg said. "I came from an offense in
college at Montana where it was normal for us to score 50 points. That's
exciting for the fans and the players. We want more of that."

The Minnesota game was only preseason, but the 36 points scored by the Giants
were more than they had scored in any of their last 52 regular-season games.
Kent Graham's touchdown passes of 37 and 53 yards, his 145 passing yards, no
interceptions and flawless leadership were the staples.

The rookie running back Sean Bennett gained 35 yards rushing and 65 more
receiving, including a 53-yard catch and run on a screen pass for a touchdown.

A quick 17-0 lead over the talented Vikings. A 20-point first half. Seventeen
first downs and 364 yards of offense, with an average gain of 6.3 yards a play.
The backup quarterback Kerry Collins threw for 127 yards and a touchdown with no
interceptions. All merry Giants signs. And consider this: 8 of 13 Giants drives
ended in Vikings territory.

The starters played for only one quarter. And it was only one preseason game.
But it was such a change that there was an air of confidence among the offensive
players and excitement among the defensive players today.

There are more offensive weapons, including a calm, experienced and decisive
quarterback in Graham, more size and speed at receiver, especially in Amani
Toomer as a starter, and more solid play in the running game.

"A lot of times in the past we haven't scored points, kept the game close or
held our own," Toomer said. "But we got off to a good start against Minnesota.
And sometimes in practice we get going and our defense can't stop us. They get
frustrated now. They realize we're getting better. Kent makes the difference. He
changes the whole makeup of the offense. He has confidence and he sees the whole
field and gives everyone opportunities to make plays."

Phillippi Sparks, a Giants cornerback, was surprised at the new-look offense. He
said the Giants' receivers impressed him with their concentration, speed and
communication with the quarterbacks.

"It has been very hard for our defense being out there for so many plays,"
Sparks said. "But what I'm seeing now from our offense is unbelievable. It's
wonderful. Now you can really start to play defense aggressively. You get enough
rest in games on defense now to be fresher and more productive. It makes our
team whole."

In theory, championship teams feature equal contributions from offense, defense
and special teams. In reality, one component often becomes a team's chief
identity. All three, however, must function at least adequately.

"We are truly a family, a close team," Gragg said. "We bite and scratch during
training camp, but we'll leave here very close and with a better offense. That's
what we need, the whole team, to do anything special."

EXTRA POINTS

Coach JIM FASSEL was expected to return from Phoenix on Tuesday or Wednesday. He
has been there since last Thursday visiting his mother, DOROTHY, 76, who had
been in critical condition with kidney-related health problems. . . . KERRY
COLLINS bruised his right thigh in the Minnesota game and did not practice
Sunday. He is day to day and is questionable to play against Jacksonville. "In
the third quarter I was rolling out on a play and their right defensive end kind
of whipped his leg out and kicked me; it was like something out of a Bruce Lee
movie," he said. "I played the rest of the game with it, but it was stiff and
sore this morning. The second day is always the worst for an injury like this."
. . . Linebacker CEDRIC JONES was in New York on Sunday for a magnetic resonance
imaging exam on his right knee that showed he did not have a serious injury. . .
. Receiver JOE JUREVICIUS is nursing a strained hip.

WVU FOOTBALL;
Chit-chat over between Liberty Bowl coaches

BYLINE: Dave Hickman, Staff writer

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. P1B

LENGTH: 620 words


MORGANTOWN - Kevin Sumlin has a word of advice not just for his Texas A&M
players, but for West Virginia's, too, leading up to the Liberty Bowl.

"Both teams need to get to bed early and get some rest," the Aggies' coach said
Thursday. "There's going be a lot of plays in this game."

Indeed, when West Virginia and Texas A&M line up for the Dec. 29 game in
Memphis, the number of plays each runs could approach triple figures. Not only
that, they could be very similar, as well.

That's because Sumlin and WVU coach Dana Holgorsen - both of whom spoke at a
bowl press conference Thursday in Memphis, Tennessee - run essentially the same
offense. It's no wonder, given that in 2008 Sumlin hired Holgorsen as his
offensive coordinator at Houston and instituted the same offense he runs now at
WVU.

Sumlin not only carried on with the offense after Holgorsen left for Oklahoma
State and then WVU, he hired one of Holgorsen's assistants, Jake Spavital, to
run it at A&M.

"The first thing we're probably going to have to do," Sumlin said Thursday, "is
change our signals."

"We're going to completely change our offense," said Holgorsen.

Well, both of those might be extreme, although both will go to great efforts to
mask their signals and, yes, each will no doubt change their offense if only in
the sense of adding a wrinkle or two.

But here's perhaps the most significant thing to two sides will have to do -
stop talking to each other.

Or at least they'll have to stop talking about the nuances of their offenses,
which they do frequently both in season and out when they aren't opponents.

"We're obviously not going to be bouncing ideas off of each other," Holgorsen
said.

That's nothing new for Holgorsen, of course. For several years, one of his
closest confidants regarding offense was Kliff Kingsbury, who played quarterback
for Holgorsen at Texas Tech. Holgorsen got Kingsbury into coaching and he
quickly moved up the ladder and became Sumlin's offensive coordinator at Texas
A&M in 2012.

And while Holgorsen and Kingsbury talked frequently then, the following season
Kingsbury was hired as the head coach at Texas Tech, which was by then a WVU
rival in the Big 12.

End of conversations, at least schematic ones.

"When Kliff was at Texas A&M and I was at West Virginia, we were talking all the
time," Holgorsen said. "And then when Kliff became the coach at Texas Tech,
which happens to be in our conference, we haven't talked since.

"When it gets competitive and you have to play a game, you're going to have a
good time talking about anything other than the actual football. So we probably
won't be talking much here in the near future."

BRIEFLY: Holgorsen reiterated during the press conference that Clint Trickett
was still his starting quarterback, but also said once again that he had no idea
if Trickett would be ready for the bowl game. Holgorsen also made reference to
Trickett and two concussions, although the only one made public was the one that
knocked him out of the Nov. 20 Kansas State game and has sidelined him since.

-Holgorsen said the team has been mostly working in the weight room and going to
class since the end of the regular season. When the Mountaineers resume practice
they will work until a few days before Christmas, be dismissed for a break and
then likely reassemble in Memphis on Christmas day.

-West Virginia has offered a scholarship to Bridgeport junior running back Dylan
Tonkery, the brother of WVU senior linebacker Wes Tonkery. After battling
injuries during the regular season, the younger Tonkery rushed for 850 yards in
the playoffs alone, including 315 in a Class AA title game rout of Frankfort.

WANNSTEDT MAKES SURE THE SPREAD DOESN'T CATCH ON AT PITT

BYLINE: Paul Zeise, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette

SECTION: SPORTS; THE BACKYARD BRAWL CHAPTER 102; Pg. D-1

LENGTH: 659 words


Pitt and West Virginia have vastly different offensive systems, with one team
using a more mainstream offense and the other a more unconventional offense.

But the interesting thing about that is this -- although West Virginia's
read-option spread is considered innovative and new, it is more popular. Spread
offenses are more common in college football than Pitt's traditional pro-style,
power-running offense.

So much so that Dave Wannstedt said that preparing for the spread offenses might
be easier than preparing for pro-style offenses because the former is so
prevalent and the latter is becoming extinct, almost like the wishbone.

"We're definitely in the minority with what we are doing here. We're dinosaurs,"
Wannstedt said. "There are very few college teams using a fullback like we use
him. We're running a pro-style offense. That's one comment that we get after
playing opponents, that their defensive coaches express to our coaches
afterwards, that they don't see our offense week in and week out.

"It is different, playing against a power attack. It all sounds good, but very
few people are committed to it like we are."

Wannstedt may be overstating the case of his offense being unconventional a
little bit, but not by much, particularly the part about using a fullback the
way the Panthers do.

Pitt fullback Henry Hynoski is clearly a throwback kind of player -- in every
sense of the word -- and he is used often in the role of a traditional blocking
back, which in these days of empty-set spread offenses and one-back sets is
clearly an outdated position.

But it wasn't that long ago that the pro-style offense was the conventional
offense and the spread offenses were gimmicks.

That changed in the early part of the decade, in part because of the success had
by people such as former West Virginia coach Rich Rodriguez running spread
offenses. A quick glance around the country suggests that the spread is no
longer a gimmick.

Just look at the Big East -- West Virginia, Syracuse, South Florida and
Cincinnati are all spread formation teams.

Connecticut is the only Big East team other than Pitt that uses a fullback
often.

Taking a look at the top 10 -- No. 1 Florida, No. 3 Texas, No. 4 TCU, No. 5
Boise State and No. 8 Oregon are spread teams, No. 7 Georgia Tech is a
triple-option team and No. 10 Ohio State is trying to figure out a system to fit
Terrelle Pryor's abilities.

Only two teams in the top 10 -- Pitt and No. 2 Alabama -- are traditional,
pro-style offenses built on power running.

Wannstedt said that is much different than the landscape 10 years ago, but it is
clearly the way college football was headed once it became clear there were a
lot more athletes available than pro-style quarterbacks.

He was asked why he has resisted the movement to the spread or one of the other
versions of the offenses that abound in college football, and he said that he is
comfortable with his philosophy. He also believes it helps in recruiting because
players are getting trained in an NFL-style system.

"I believe in what we do," Wannstedt said. "I know that you can be successful
doing what we are doing. We recruit players to fit into our system. We're going
to go out and recruit great running backs, great receivers, great tight ends and
quarterbacks that can throw the ball. I think it helps our defense, too.

"Our defense has to be tough. Going against our offense all training camp and in
spring practice, it's not finesse."

Sports of The Times;
Suddenly, the Sputtering Giants Are in Playoff Jeopardy

BYLINE: By DAVE ANDERSON

SECTION: Section C; Page 7; Column 1; Sports Desk

LENGTH: 758 words

DATELINE: EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.


STEP up. That's the fashionable phrase in sports. Almost every day a coach or a
player in every sport is heard talking about how the team has to "step up" now.
But instead of stepping up when their schedule toughened, the Giants have
stepped down.

And unless the Giants start stepping up soon, they will miss the Super Bowl
XXXII playoffs.

More and more, it appears that only the winner of the National Football
Conference East may make the playoffs, because the three wild-card teams could
all come from the Central Division.

It also appears, judging by yesterday's 20-8 loss to Tampa Bay following a 7-7
tie in Washington, that the Giants' offense has vanished.

Although the Giants are still in first place with a 7-5-1 record, they are now
only one game ahead of the Eagles and the Redskins, each 6-6-1, who are their
next two opponents. And the Cowboys are still alive at 6-7.

If the Giants lose in Philadelphia next Sunday while the Redskins win in
Arizona, suddenly the Giants, Eagles and Redskins would be tied for first place,
each at 7-6-1 with two games remaining.

And if the Giants' offense doesn't start producing more than one touchdown every
two games, they are more than likely to lose their remaining three games -- at
Philadelphia, with the Redskins at Giants Stadium a week from Saturday and at
Dallas in the season finale.

If that were to happen, the Giants would finish 7-8-1 and out of the playoffs.

"We haven't been executing on offense at all," Coach Jim Fassel acknowledged.
"We are not hitting on any cylinders. We've got mental mistakes, lack of
execution, lack of aggressiveness."

But maybe the National Football League's theory of relativity has caught up with
the Giant offense.

During the early weeks of Danny Kanell's takeover at quarterback, mostly against
teams that will not make the playoffs, skeptics kept waiting to see what would
happen in the final five games of what, over all, was a relatively easy
schedule. And after two of those final five games, the Giants' offense has
turned into a dud.

Against the Bucs (now 9-4), the offense produced only 202 yards of net offense,
only 103 on Kanell's passing.

"I played poorly out there," Kanell said. "I made a couple key mistakes in the
game. Maybe I was trying to make something happen, but I've got to be smarter
with the football. I've got to make better decisions."

Two of Kanell's bad decisions resulted in interceptions, the first leading to
the Bucs' first touchdown. That's when Fassel called the first of two sideline
meetings with the offense. And after the game, he growled louder.

"I wasn't real happy," the coach said later of his post-game tirade.

Fassel warned of benchings if the offense sputters in Philadelphia, if not
during practice this week. But his growling may not be enough to ignite an
offense that simply might not be talented enough to score much against sturdy
defensive units.

Kanell's first interception provoked boos from many of the 68,678 parishioners.
Some sounded restless enough to chant, "We want Brown," but they apparently bit
their tongues. So did Fassel, although he acknowledged having thought about
inserting Dave Brown.

"Then we moved the ball down," the coach said, "and kicked that field goal."

Asked how close he had come to switching quarterbacks, Fassel said, "I don't
know." When asked if Kanell would start in Philadelphia, he said, "Yes." But
another sputtering first half in Philadelphia and Kanell might not finish that
game.

"Everybody had a turn messing up, everybody," fullback Charles Way said,
alluding to his teammates on the offensive unit. "You can do all the talking in
the world. You've got to want it."

When the Giants gather today to watch films of yesterday's debacle, the players
reportedly intend to hold a team meeting. But linebacker Jessie Armstead talked
about how "we'll get it straight" on Wednesday when the players return after
tomorrow's day off.

"We'll see who wants to play," Armstead said, "and who doesn't want to play."

But why Wednesday? Why would anybody really see that before Sunday's game
begins?

"Because on Wednesday, we'll talk among each other, then go out and practice and
we'll see," Armstead said. "Let's close the door and talk. Get it right in the
house first, then worry about outside the house. The defense talking to the
offense, the offense talking to the defense. You put your name up, the camera's
on you."

For the final three games, the camera will be on all the Giants, to see if they
step up instead of stepping down.

A third woman says N.Y. officer made her strip
A Long Island, N.Y., police officer accused of forcing women to strip after they
failed breath tests was suspended without pay Friday as a third woman came
forward with a similar story. Two of the women claimed Frank Wright, a nine-year
Suffolk County police veteran, drove them to empty parking lots and forced them
to strip after they failed alcohol breath tests. One of them said she was forced
to walk home wearing only underwear and shoes. A third woman, who came forward
Friday, said that after she failed a breath test, Wright made her pull up her
blouse and bra while he pointed a flashlight at her. The women said that in
return for removing their clothes, they were not charged with drunken driving.

Husband shoots man he thinks raped wife
An enraged husband, using a composite sketch, tracked down and shot a man he
believed had raped his wife, shouting, ''This is for my wife!'' police in
Hermosa Beach, Calif., said Friday. Anthony Starita, 32, was arrested for
investigation of attempted murder in the wounding early Thursday of Ali Sina
Sharareh, who already had a rape conviction on his record. Sharareh, 22, was in
fair condition Friday. Sharareh has not been charged in the rape of Starita's
wife, but Officer Paul Wolcott said there is a ''high probability'' that Starita
shot the right man. The husband could get 15 years to life in prison, plus extra
years for using a handgun. Sharareh, if arrested and convicted in the rape,
could get 16 years as a second-time offender.

Racial profiling case revived by N.J. court
An appeals court revived the most explosive case in New Jersey's racial
profiling controversy Friday, reinstating criminal charges against two state
troopers accused of shooting three minority men on the New Jersey Turnpike two
years ago. The ruling overturned a ruling by Superior Court Judge Andrew
Smithson, who threw out charges against troopers John Hogan and James Kenna
because of errors by prosecutors. Lawyers for Hogan and Kenna said they are
considering appeals to the New Jersey Supreme Court.

Suits link mouthwash at hospital to deaths
Relatives of four people who died at a hospital in Fargo, N.D., in 1999 have
filed lawsuits claiming the deaths were caused by contaminated mouthwash.  The
lawsuits, filed in U.S. District Court in Fargo, say the DawnMist Mouth Rinse
used at Fargo's MeritCare Hospital was contaminated with Burkholderia cepacia.
It is described in the lawsuits as a ''virulent and rapidly spreading bacteria
that is resistant to almost all antibiotics.'' The deaths occurred in January
1999 and February 1999. The mouthwash was recalled in the spring of 1999 by its
distributor, Donovan Industries of Tampa, Fla., according to the Food and Drug
Administration.

Covering the spread concern for Indiana

BYLINE: By CURT RALLO; Tribune Staff Writer

SECTION: ; Pg. W3; GAMEDAY 2002

LENGTH: 385 words


Indiana will face a hurry-up spread offense when the Hoosiers battle
Northwestern on Saturday.

Hoosier coach Gerry DiNardo said that Indiana has faced something similar to
Northwestern's offense already this season.

"It's actually very similar to Central Michigan," DiNardo said. "It's the
Central Michigan/Tulane/West Virginia/Clemson spread-offense package in the true
sense of the word.

"(Northwestern runs) the zone play out of the shotgun, the tackle trap, a little
bit of option, and then they throw the ball underneath," DiNardo continued.
"People say spread-offense when they get four wide, but we get four-wide but we
are nowhere close to running the spread-offense. People confuse the
spread-formation with the spread-offense. They're a packaged offense, they stick
with it, and it's difficult to stop. They run it very good and it suits their
personnel very well. It's a chicken-and-an-egg thing and that's probably why
they went to it."

Another switch

 Indiana senior Kris Dielman has switched back and forth from defensive tackle
to tight end four times. Make that five after last Saturday's game against
Illinois.

Dielman started this season as a defensive tackle, but played some tight end
last Saturday. He said that he would enjoy more time at tight end.

"With Illinois, it was circumstances," Dielman said of the reason he played at
tight end. "There was really no need to put me in there, we were never really in
an area where they would use me. In the next four games, if we're in the red
zone and they need to use me more, they'll use me more, especially with closer
games.

"We've been talking about it ever since the season started," Dielman said of
playing tight end. "I think they wanted me to figure out the defense first and
then I got injured, so they didn't want to put me in too much stuff. We started
talking about it again a few weeks ago. That's up to the coaches, if they want
to use me, they can use me. If they don't, then I'm happy on defense."

Taking a break

 Purdue's Boilermakers hope to get some rest and recovery during their bye week.

"First of all, you want to take advantage of the bye week to recover
physically," Purdue coach Joe Tiller said of having this week off. "As a result
of that, we did not practice on Sunday like we normally do."

Iowa columnist: 'Gophers' statistics scream something . . . WE STINK!'

BYLINE: By Mike Hlas Cedar Rapids Gazette

SECTION: SPORTS; Gophers

LENGTH: 463 words


The University of Minnesota's 1-6 football record speaks for itself, but the
Gophers' statistics scream something. Namely, WE STINK!

Of the 120 teams in the NCAA's Football Bowl Subdivision, Minnesota ranks in the
bottom 96 in passing offense, passing efficiency, total offense, scoring offense
, rushing defense, total defense and turnover margin.

The Gophers are last in the Big Ten in rushing offense, total offense, scoring
offense, passing efficiency and turnover margin.

In Big Ten games alone, Minnesota is 0-3 and has been outscored by the total of
144-31. Fourteen of those points came against Nebraska last Saturday after the
Cornhuskers had compiled a 34-0 halftime lead on the way to a 41-14 cruise.

Iowa is averaging 29.7 points in Big Ten games, and that's fourth-best in the
conference. Minnesota averages 10.3 points, almost five full points worse than
the next-poorest, Indiana.

The Hawkeyes are allowing 22.7 points per league game, seventh-best. Minnesota
yields 48 points per game, almost eight full points (more) than the
next-poorest, Indiana.

In its three conference games, Minnesota is averaging a woeful 214.7 yards a
game. That's 100 yards worse than all but one other Big Ten team. No, it isn't
Indiana. It's Ohio State. Indiana's 414-yard land grab at Iowa helped pad its
average.

Minnesota has allowed 489 yards per game in Big Ten play. That actually is 1.5
yards better than another conference squad. Yep. Indiana.

The Gophers are the only team that is yet to intercept a pass in conference
games. But the need to throw against them isn't great, as evidenced by them
allowing 308 rushing yards in league play.

Minnesota has been outgained by 274 yards a game in the conference. Repeat, 274
yards a game!

Bad team, folks. Abysmal.

But I have done the Hawkeyes a horrible disservice by writing this? One reader
will surely think so. Here's an email I got after I wrote last Monday (Oct. 17)
that Iowa's next two foes (Indiana, Minnesota) were the least of the Leaders and
the lousiest of the Legends:

"Mike, thanks for adding to all the locker room hype that Indiana and Minnesota
( 'Bottom Dwellers') need in preparing for Ipwa the next two weeks. Your article
will definitely adorn the walls of their facilities. This is not how you deal
with your future opponents, whether it comes from the Hawkeye program, or from
our local media sources. You have excellent jounalisitic skills and should have
better judgement in the way you word these articles. They will only come back to
haunt the Hawks, if not in the near future, then definitely in the next couple
of years when those teams are more competitive. You had better hope that we win
the next two games or the Hawks will be among the 'Bottom Dwellers.' "

More offensive coaches moving up

BYLINE: JASON KERSEY, Staff writer

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 6C

LENGTH: 819 words

DATELINE: NORMAN


NORMAN - Thirteen Football Bowl Subdivision programs - and counting - will have
new head coaches next season.

Only one has filled its opening so far; considering recent trends and the
eye-popping offensive numbers being recorded nationally, Kentucky's hire -
former Florida State defensive coordinator Mark Stoops - seems like an anomaly.

Over the past decade, spread offenses have taken the nation by storm and helped
elevate several offensive coordinators into head coaching gigs.

But where does that leave talented, ambitious defensive coaches?

Fourteen-year Oklahoma coach Bob Stoops views his brother's hire at Kentucky as
evidence that athletic directors still believe defensive gurus are capable of
running entire football programs.

"There's enough quality guys that have defensive backgrounds that are out
there," Bob Stoops said.

"People are still realizing that and seeing that."

Last season, Arizona fired another defensive guy from the same family and
replaced him with offensive whiz Rich Rodriguez.

Mike Stoops got the Arizona gig in 2003, after he'd led dominant Sooner defenses
for four years.

Even after his first head coaching experience - and all the offensive changes
over the past decade - Mike Stoops remains staunch in his belief that defense is
ultimately what wins championships.

"I guess people like all that scoring, so those guys are all very good and were
great coordinators and certainly have become great head coaches," said Mike
Stoops, who returned to his old job in January.

"But I still think you win with defense."

The Southeastern Conference's run of six consecutive national championships
would seem to bolster that argument; Alabama coach Nick Saban is a former
defensive coordinator, and he's won three career national titles.

But the reality remains: Spread offenses reign supreme right now in the Big 12
Conference; West Virginia beat Baylor 70-63 earlier this season.

Oklahoma has survived back-to-back shootouts with West Virginia and Oklahoma
State, winning 50-49 and 51-48, respectively.

"If you're a defensive coordinator or defensive coach, you're pulling your hair
out," said Mark Mangino, one of five OU offensive coordinators under Stoops who
became FBS head coaches.

Bob Stoops said there's no reason college football programs can't have it both
ways if they hire a defensive-oriented head coach.

Stoops, who was a defensive coordinator at Florida and Kansas State, said the
key is hiring good offensive coaches.

"You hire a good offensive coordinator, like I feel I have through the years,
and you're in good shape," Bob Stoops said.

Some teams may be in good shape; for the most part, though, the same can't be
said for defensive coordinators with head coaching aspirations.

"I knew as football was speeding up on offense, it would create some problems on
defense," Mangino said. "But I never thought we'd get to a point where we'd have
games like (West Virginia-Baylor).

"But I think we will, until the defenses catches up. ... It may take a couple
years, but they will catch up, and the offense will come up with something else
to try to keep them off balance."

OFFENSE OR DEFENSE?

In recent seasons, coaching hires across college football have heavily leaned
toward candidates with a background on offense.

Here's a breakdown of the last three seasons of hires at BCS schools.

FOOTBALL: GIANTS NOTEBOOK;
Familiar Look in Packers' Offense

BYLINE: By MIKE FREEMAN

SECTION: Section 1;  Page 30;  Column 6;  Sports Desk

LENGTH: 610 words

DATELINE: EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J., Sept. 15


West Coast offense, Part II.

Here they go again. The Giants on Sunday will face the Green Bay Packers, who
may run that offense better than the Kansas City Chiefs.

The originator of the offense is Bill Walsh, the former head coach of the San
Francisco 49ers. The coach of the Packers, Mike Holmgren, studied under Walsh
and was his offensive coordinator. If anyone in football knows the offense well,
it's Holmgren.

"I think all of the guys who worked for Bill Walsh at one time, we've gone on to
various places, you start to do some things you are comfortable with," Holmgren
said. "I probably run as close to what we ran in San Francisco as any of the
coaches who are mentioned typically. At the same time, we don't have the same
players so you have to be flexible and adapt around the players you have."

In San Francisco he had Jerry Rice, who could turn a quick 5-yard slant into an
80-yard touchdown. In Green Bay he had Sterling Sharpe, who could carry five
cornerbacks on his broad shoulders; but a neck injury forced Sharpe out of the
game and into the ESPN studio.

But Holmgren still has his offense and a gunslinger quarterback in Brett Favre,
who at times looks like he could take the Packers to the Super Bowl and at other
times looks like he couldn't hit the Empire State Building. The Giants only hope
they don't get the Favre who threw a 99-yard touchdown pass against the Chicago
Bears on Monday night.

Part of the Giants' problem against the Chiefs was fatigue. With the offense
struggling in the second half, the defense spent much of the fourth quarter on
the field. The Chiefs kept hitting the Giants with little dump-off plays, making
them run constantly.

The Giants can expect more of the same. This time, they will be more ready for
another visit to the West Coast.




Hamilton to Appeal Fine



 Giants defensive lineman Keith Hamilton said he will appeal his $7,500 fine. "I
think it was a bad call; it was unfair," Hamilton said.

Hamilton was fined by the National Football League for hitting Chiefs
quarterback Steve Bono. The official said Hamilton put all his weight on Bono
through the hit instead of pulling up. But Hamilton was fined more because he
led with his helmet, which is against the rules.

"I thought it was a legitimate hit," Hamilton said. "It was clean."




Calloway's Quiet Streak



 Wide receiver Chris Calloway is someone few people around the league have heard
of but he is quickly becoming a major player.

Even though he only stands 5-10 and weighs 188 pounds, Calloway has a good
combination of power and speed. Despite missing most of training camp with a
severely pulled hamstring and then reinjuring it against Dallas, he had 5
catches for 100 yards and 1 touchdown against Kansas City.

Calloway has a 27-game catch streak, which is fourth-best in team history. If he
goes six more games with a catch, Calloway would move ahead of Homer Jones (32
catches) for consecutive games with a pass reception. David Meggett, now with
the New England Patriots, heads the list with 45 receptions followed by Bob
Tucker with 44.




September Song



 Despite going 0-2, the Giants still have one of the best September records of
any league team since 1985. The Giants are 24-13 since 1985, third-best in the
National Football Conference. The Chicago Bears had the best record in the
conference with a 29-10 mark, followed by the San Francisco 49ers at 27-12.




The Defense Does Dinner



 Many members of the defense went to dinner Thursday night as sort of a unity
get-together. Linebacker Michael Brooks was one of the players who organized it.

Keeping WKU offense off field an objective for Herd

BYLINE: Gary Fauber, The Register-Herald, Beckley, W.Va.

SECTION: SPORTS

LENGTH: 427 words


Nov. 23--Western Kentucky has an offense that averages well over 40 points and
500 yards per game. The Hilltoppers hold on to the football, turning it over
fewer times than any team in Conference USA.

They also have been the most efficient team in the red zone, scoring on 49 of
their 56 trips into their opponents' 20-yard line.

That makes time of possession important as Marshall (9-2, 6-1 C-USA) travels to
Bowling Green, Ky., for its Black Friday clash with the Hilltoppers (9-2, 7-0)
at noon.

The offense, led by sixth-year senior quarterback Brandon Doughty, can't score
from the sideline.

"We've had a lot of discussions on keeping their offense off the field,"
Marshall coach Doc Holliday said. "If you look at time of possession, we're
about in the middle of the pack as far as our league is concerned."

The Thundering Herd is sixth in C-USA in time of possession, owning the ball an
average of 30:09 per game. Western Kentucky is eighth at 29:10.

A lot of that, of course, has to do with differing approaches on offense.
Marshall, even with the loss of senior Devon Johnson, has run the ball (430)
slightly more than it has thrown (394), and is second in the league in rushing
with an average of 181.3 yards per game.

The Hilltoppers, of course, have the best passing attack in C-USA, averaging
360.9 yards through the air. Because of that, Western is averaging 43.7 points
and 517.7 total yards per contest.

Doughty, the 2014 C-USA Most Valuable Player, leads the conference with 346.7
yards per game and has 37 touchdowns to just six interceptions.

Marshall, meanwhile, has the league's best defense against the pass, allowing
just 186.2 yards through the air. The Herd also allows just 15.6 points per
game.

And no team has been better at defending the red zone -- in the rare times
opponents have gotten that far. The Herd has allowed points on just 22 of
opponents' 32 trips inside the 20 (68.8 percent).

The game will also pit the league's top two teams in turnover ratio. The
Hilltoppers are first at plus-11 (23 gained/12 lost), and Marshall is second at
plus-6 (25 gained/19 lost).

"Both of us have done a good job of getting takeaways and taking care of the
football, for the most part," Holliday said. "That's why we are where we are
right now, playing for the East (Division) championship. It's going to be a
great game."

Trends

Utah and BYU have stated winning the MWC title is a goal for the programs this
year. It's also a goal for . . . well, that is about it.

Other than Utah and BYU, most teams in the conference seem to be in a rebuilding
mode. TCU, expected to finish third in the conference, is still a distant third
pick. In 2007 the Horned Frogs were nearly everyone's choice to break into the
BCS, but limped to an 8-5 finish that ended with a win over Houston in the Texas
Bowl.

It was a disappointing season for TCU, and probably for some in the MWC offices
who realize that a perceived depth to a league is nearly as vital as a TV
contract if it wants to be respected on the national level.

BYU has gone undefeated the last two seasons, which is great for the Cougars,
but is it really good for the league?

Since the conference was founded in 1999 only four schools have won the title,
including ties: Utah (3 times), Colorado State (3), BYU (4) and TCU (1). A
little shakeup at the top, or at least some fresh competition - such as what Air
Force provided last season - would do the conference good.

At least the league went 4-1 in its bowl games in 2007, with Utah, BYU and New
Mexico winning along with New Mexico. Air Force lost to Cal, 42-36, in the Armed
Forces Bowl.

Notes around the league

Air Force has a huge problem in replacing its big senior class with just eight
returning starters. The issue is further complicated because of the military
duties of Air Force's players. So many were absent during spring practice, which
is considered to be the most vital learning time for teams, that coach Troy
Calhoun had a hard time finding enough guys to run drills in practice.

Air Force corner Reggie Rembert probably will spend some time on the offensive
side of the ball to, in addition to returning punts and kickoffs. Air Force
plans to use his speed as a running back and or receiver.

Colorado State's offense should get a big boost from the return of tight end
Kory Sperry, who tore his anterior cruciate ligament in the third game of the
2007 season. He is considered a good NFL prospect after finishing the 2006
season with 36 receptions for 380 yards and five touchdowns as a H-back.

Utah isn't the only team sporting some new uniforms this season. UNLV signed a
new deal with Nike and is debuting new scarlet and gray uniforms.

UNLV dubs itself Pac-10 east. Since 1999 the school has attracted 16 former
Pac-10 players including five current players, headlined by running back Frank
Summers who was a former Cal recruit and Thor Pili, a Timpanogos H.S. graduate
who originally chose Oregon.

New Mexico isn't taking a break in its nonconference schedule, playing Tulsa,
Texas A&M and Arizona. It didn't get any favors from the conference office
either, opening with TCU rather than a nonconference opponent, as coach Rocky
Long would prefer.

The Lobos' are trying to create a more intimidating atmosphere in their stadium.
One way of doing so is to give away football tickets to its students, who
recently were dubbed the "Howl Raisers."

If UNLV's Mike Sanford is on the hot seat, than San Diego State coach Chuck
Long's is at least warm. He is just 7-17 since arriving in 2006 and could be yet
another coach who couldn't survive the MWC. A win at Notre Dame would keep some
folks quiet, but winning in South Bend with a team that gave up 34.4 points in
2007 is going to be very hard indeed.

The Aztecs hope a change of scenery will make them tough as marines. The program
held its fall camp at the Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, the Corps' largest
west coast training facility that includes more than 125,000 acres.

TCU's Braylon Broughton was tabbed as the preseason Freshman of the Year. He
redshirted in 2007 after joining the Frogs in 2006 as a highly recruited
defensive end.

Wyoming celebrates its 1,000th game on Sept. 6 when Air Force visits. The
Cowboys have played 466 home games with a winning percentage of 62.2 percent,
compared to a 37.3 winning percentage in its 518 road games.

Wyoming will have a familiar face to some on its sidelines. Bob Cole, a former
offensive coordinator at Utah State (2000-04) joined Wyoming's staff for the
2008 season. He was most recently at Florida A&M.

Coach on the move

Troy Calhoun met a lot of skepticism when he took over as Air Force's head coach
in 2007 and proclaimed the Falcons would no longer rely as extensively on the
triple option offense. But his results quickly made the doubters believers as
Air Force went 9-4 after three straight losing seasons.

Calhoun was named the conference coach of the year. Even though his team was
only picked to finish sixth, no one will overlook the Falcons this season.

Coach on the hot seat

No doubt about it, former Utah offensive coordinator Mike Sanford is feeling the
heat after going just 6-29 in three seasons in Vegas. UNLV hasn't had a winning
season in eight years and was picked to finish last in 2008. At MWC media days
Sanford said this season should be an improvement. If it's not, he will almost
certainly be shown the door.

MWC Players to Watch

Ryan Wolfe, Jr., UNLV

He is one of the few bright spots for the Rebels, finishing the 2007 season with
66 receptions for 784 yards and two touchdowns. He likes the deep routes and he
likes making the big plays. If he gets behind a defense he'll make them pay.

Blake Schlueter, Sr., TCU

Center has made the watch list for several national awards. The 6-foot-3,
284-pounder earned second-team all-MWC honors in 2007.

Rodney Ferguson, Sr., New Mexico

The running back starts the 2008 season with 2,459 yards in his career, good for
the sixth-best in career yards in school history. He has averaged 1,205 the last
two seasons.

Frank Summers, Sr., UNLV

Nicknamed the Tank, he ran for 190 yards and two touchdowns on 29 carries
against Utah. Afterward, coach Mike Sanford was quoted as saying Utah's
defenders were scared to tackle him. He finished the season with 928 yards on
202 carries.

John Fletcher, Jr., Wyoming

The defensive tackle ranked 11th nationally with 10.5 sacks in 2007 and led
Wyoming with 14 tackles for a loss.

Ryan Kemp, Sr., Air Force

Defensive end was an honorable mention all-MWC pick after finishing with 54
tackles, including 8.5 tackles for a loss.

Ward Dobbs, Sr., Wyoming

An inside linebacker who only needs 17 tackles to break into Wyoming's Top 10
career list. He has 242 and averaged 8.2 per game in 2007.

Russell Allen, Sr., San Diego State

The linebacker led San Diego State with 119 tackles in 2007 and has started 31
games in his career. He earned MWC all-conference honorable mention after
leading the conference in tackles per game (10.6).

Jason Phillips, Sr., TCU

The linebacker was picked as the conference's preseason defensive player of the
year. He has 231 career tackles and has earned all-conference honors for the
last three seasons.

DeAndre Wright, Sr., New Mexico

Has started 26 consecutive games at corner and led the team in 2007 with 12
passes defended. He had just 11 passes thrown his way in the last seven games.

Others to watch

* Donovan Porterie, New Mexico, Jr., QB

* Casey Flair, UNLV, Sr., WR

* Devin Moore, Wyoming, Sr., RB

* Mike Juergens, Wyoming, Sr., OLB

* Stephen Hodge, TCU, Sr., S

* Nick Charles, Air Force, Jr., OL

* Jeff Horinek, CSU, Sr., LB

STEELERS;
Pittsburgh riding high on strength of offence

BYLINE: JOHN PERROTTO, The Associated Press

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. S7

LENGTH: 462 words

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH


The Steelers' offence has put on a show over the past six weeks like at no other
time in franchise history.

Nobody is enjoying watching the offence pile up the points more than the
Pittsburgh defence. It has the best seat in the house for the high-scoring
attack that frees the defence to get after opponents as they try to play
catch-up.

"We have an offence that does a great, great job," safety Will Allen said. "It's
hard to stop those guys."

The Steelers scored 24 straight points last Sunday to rally for a 34-27 victory
over the Denver Broncos, who lead the NFL in points and total yards allowed.

The win enabled the Steelers (9-5) to control their fate when it comes to making
the playoffs; they will qualify for the postseason by winning their final two
games, Sunday at Baltimore (4-10) and at Cleveland (311) on Jan. 3.

The Steelers could also clinch a berth Sunday if they win and the New York Jets
(9-5) lose at home to the AFC East champion New England Patriots (12-2).

While the six-time Super Bowlwinning franchise has built much of its history on
the foundation of strong defence, it is the offence that is leading the charge
now. The Steelers have scored at least 30 points in a team-record six straight
games, going 5-1 in that span to help overcome a 4-4 first half of the schedule.

"Our offence is unstoppable," defensive end Cam Heyward said. "To have an
offence that can go up and down with anybody, it doesn't matter who's out there.
It's pretty special."

The offence helps take pressure off a defence that has had its ups and downs.
Pittsburgh is fifth in the NFL in rushing defence with 89.4 yards allowed a
game, but 31st against the pass, giving up an average of 279.1 yards.

"You really don't see themselves rest on their laurels or patting themselves on
the back," Heyward said of the offence.

"They're trying to continue to score. You appreciate that as a defence because
they give some leeway at times."

The Steelers seemingly should be able to keep putting up big numbers against the
injury-ravaged Ravens and woeful Browns.

Antonio Brown has 64 catches for 868 yards in the past six games, leading the
league in both categories in that span, while quarterback Ben Roethlisberger has
averaged 365.8 yards and thrown 13 touchdown passes.

The Steelers are also healthy.

Everyone practised fully Friday and no one was listed as doubtful or
questionable on the injury report.

"We understand if we want to get to where we want to get to, we have to win
these games," Heyward said. "The thing we embrace is that we are in control. If
we continue to win, continue to do the things we have been accustomed to doing,
then we put ourselves in good spots.

You can't look at what's going on here, what's going on there.

You take care of your business and you are all right."

NATION IN BRIEF; Woman braves flames to save kids

SECTION: NATIONAL NEWS; SECTION A; PAGE 08

LENGTH: 609 words


COLORADO: A woman saved the lives of her two children by breaking into a bedroom
engulfed in flames and throwing them out a window to safety, authorities said.

Samantha Engelhardt, 23, was awakened from a nap in her suburban Denver home
Sunday afternoon by the screams of her 3-year-old son and 18- month-old
daughter. After pushing down the bedroom door, which was in flames, she threw a
chair through the first-floor window and tossed the children out. Neighbors
pulled them away to safety, said Aurora Fire Lt. Marty La Russo.

"If it wasn't for the mother entering that bedroom, we would have undoubtedly
had two dead children," the lieutenant said.

OHIO: AIDS victim on trial for spitting. An AIDS-infected man went on trial
Monday in Cincinnati on charges he tried to kill three sheriff's officers and a
nurse by spitting his infected blood at them. Steve O'Banion, 40, who is charged
with four counts of attempted murder, claims officers beat him up after his
arrest Sept. 3 for jaywalking. Officer Thomas Prem, who arrested Mr. O'Banion
for jaywalking, testified that Mr. O'Banion resisted arrest and received cuts on
the nose, shoulders and forehead when police tried to restrain him.

CALIFORNIA: Freeze! Drop that frozen squirrel! A man who hit his wife with a
frozen squirrel was jailed on suspicion of spousal abuse, Sacramento police said
Monday. Kao Khae Saephan, 26, had been arguing with his wife early Monday
morning when he walked into the kitchen and took several frozen squirrels from
the freezer, a police spokeswoman said. The wife told police that when she
walked into the room, her husband swung the squirrels at her and struck her in
the head. She fell against a table and received a cut above her eye, the
spokeswoman said.

OHIO: Workers must sweat, automaker says. Some workers at Chrysler Corp.'s Jeep
plant in Toledo have been asked to stop using anti- perspirants because they can
leave craters in the paint on vehicles, causing thousands of dollars in damage.
The problem is most frequent when an employee's armpit is directly over a
vehicle's hood and the person is wiping the vehicle, Chrysler said. Despite the
protection of clothing on the workers, tiny flakes of anti-perspirants can
filter through their garments or fall out of their sleeves or collars onto the
cars. Chrysler still allows the workers to wear deodorants, as long as they do
not flake.

NEBRASKA: Police chases OK again - sometimes. Omaha Police Chief James Skinner
on Monday lifted the blanket ban on police chases he imposed last week, saying
officers now may pursue suspects involved in murder, assault, sexual assault,
robbery or abduction. Chief Skinner said the original no-chase policy, announced
last Tuesday and barring officers from engaging in hot pursuits for any reason,
was due to $ 10 million in lawsuits filed against the city after chases that
killed or injured people. Police union officials said under the new policy,
officers still would face a dilemma over whether to chase reckless drivers.;

Oklahoma Gov. David Walters's son lapsed into a coma after police found him
unconscious in a car from an apparent drug overdose, officials said. . . .
Testing began for an electronic toll system similar to supermarket checkout
scanners that will allow drivers on the New York State Thruway to zip through
toll booths without stopping. . . . Federal regulators sued Arizona Gov. Fife
Symington and 11 other former officers of a failed savings and loan, alleging
their mishandling of the business cost taxpayers millions of dollars.

Stop idolizing abusive athletes: Team officials, the media and fans must make it
clear that sports heroes cannot get away with assaulting women.

SOURCE: Citizen Special

BYLINE: Caryl Rivers

SECTION: News; Pg. B7

LENGTH: 979 words

Expect another circus as the next phase in the legal case against National
Basketball Association star Kobe Bryant develops. Mr. Bryant, of course, has not
been convicted of any rape charges and should be given the presumption of
innocence.

But the case draws attention to the disturbingly common occurrence of male
sports stars running afoul of women. It's an issue that -- in the heat of the
baseball playoffs and onset of the NFL football season -- deserves our
inspection.

Since Mr. Bryant's arrest last July, according to the Los Angeles Times, another
prominent NBA player, Washington Wizards guard Jerry Stackhouse, has been
charged with assaulting a woman by allegedly grabbing her around the neck and
throwing her to the ground.

Another high-profile athlete recently accused of abusing a woman is running back
Michael Pittman of the Super Bowl champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He is alleged
to have used his Hummer in May 2003 to ram his wife's car, which also contained
their two-year-old son and a babysitter. Mr. Pittman was already on probation
for two domestic violence cases from 2001.

Then there's Atlanta Hawks forward Glenn Robinson. In 2003, he became only the
second NBA player -- Ruben Patterson was the first in 2001 -- suspended for
committing crimes against women after his conviction on assault and spousal
battery.

And let's not forget Ricky Clemons, basketball whiz for the University of
Missouri. He was jailed after violating his probation, three months after he had
been charged with restraining and choking his girlfriend.

Athletes often get lighter sentences for such behaviour than the average
offender. Jeffrey R. Benedict, author of Public Heroes, Private Felons: Athletes
and Crimes against Women, reported that more than 400 professional and college
athletes have been publicly accused of violent crimes against women in the past
10 years and few have been prosecuted, much less jailed.

He says this has "dulled public consciousness of their increasing levels of
deviance." The result: Athletes, spurred on by a "diminishing sense of shame
over their socially degenerate behaviour," continue the assaults.

These guys generate a great deal of money for both college and pro teams. So
there is a lot invested is seeing them as innocent and in seeing the accuser as
a slut or a psychopath, no matter what her background.

Desiree Washington was a church-going beauty queen with a squeaky-clean
reputation when she was raped by Mike Tyson in an Indianapolis hotel room in
1991. But even given Mr. Tyson's thuggish reputation and the brutality of the
rape -- he reportedly held her off the ground by her heels -- she found herself
the subject of probing questions about her morality. Mr. Tyson himself claimed
in a recent interview that he didn't rape Ms. Washington -- even though he went
to jail -- but he was so angry that, "I just hate her guts. I really wish I did.
Now I really do want to rape her."

It's always been tough for women who accuse high-profile men of sexual assault.
Susan Estrich, the UCLA law professor who wrote about her own rape in her book
Real Rape, believes that the law does not adequately defend accusers. "When
you've got a high profile defendant in a highly competitive news environment and
the Internet era," she told The New York Times, "you're not going to get any
protection." All the publicity, she said, may force the alleged victim into the
open. "By the time they're done with her, she's going to be a walking, talking,
unstable slut. She'll end up having to out herself."

We have seen Kobe Bryant stand next to his wife and apologize for his infidelity
while denying the assault, in a news conference staged by very expensive media
advisers. Make no mistake; a high-profile athlete isn't just a defendant, he's a
corporate investment. (In Mr. Kobe's case, a multimillion-dollar one, given all
his endorsements.)

"This is a business and it's about money," said Kathy Redmond, founder of the
National Coalition Against Violent Athletes in Littleton, Colorado. "When you
look at the amount that could be poured into this by those who see Kobe as an
investment, when you consider who he is, the district attorney knows how
difficult this will be to prove."

While high-profile athletes -- even convicted ones -- go back to their
money-making careers, the women who brought charges against them are forever
branded. Some, like Ms. Washington, have to hear their attackers defame and
threaten them in public even years later.

This is an issue that runs deep in sports-mad U.S. society.

Jeffrey Benedict says, "Far too many of the younger generation's male role
models possess a fundamental disrespect for women." And young, talented athletes
too often get the message from the people who make money from their talents that
they will be protected, whatever they do. Since domestic violence and sexual
abuse often go unreported, observers believe the incidence of such acts by
members of pro teams are much higher than reported.

Cathy Redmond of the National Coalition Against Violent Athletes estimates that
perhaps one-quarter of pro football players may have been involved in such
behaviour. "They know what their standing is in the community and they know they
can get away with it."

For the good of sports, women in general and the players themselves -- who are
all tarred by the behaviour of their abusive teammates -- this has to change.
Sports leagues, coaches, sportswriters and those who hand out big cheques for
endorsements have to make it clear that athletes are not above the law and that
if they assault or batter women, they will be held fully accountable.

Until that happens, ugly incidents will continue to mar the pastimes that bring
us, "the thrill of victory, the agony of defeat."

Ryan turns to new faces to build up Cardinals' offense

BYLINE: Ken Brazzle

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 10C

LENGTH: 385 words

DATELINE: TEMPE, Ariz.


Arizona Cardinals coach Buddy Ryan knows defense. But does he know offense?

Ryan's attention to his defense, the third-best in the NFL last season, might
have come at the expense of the offense.

The Cardinals ranked:

-- 22nd (of 28) in passing.

-- 25th in total offense.

-- 27th in rushing yards per attempt.

-- 27th in scoring.

-- 27th in third-down efficiency.

"Offense was something we lacked last year," says fullback Larry Centers, the
team's leading pass receiver and second-leading rusher.

"Buddy handcuffed the offense last year because he wasn't happy with what he had
on the field," center Ed Cunningham says.

Centers was the lone skilled position starter deemed untouchable after an 8-8
season.

Gone: wide receivers Randal Hill, Ricky Proehl and Gary Clark; quarterbacks Jay
Schroeder, Steve Beuerlein and Jim McMahon; and tailback Ron Moore.

Changes were made also in the offensive line. Guard Duval Love (ex-Steeler),
center Jamie Dukes (ex-Packer) and tackle Larry Tharpe (ex-Lion) were free-agent
acquisitions.

"I don't make any friends," says Cunningham. "That way I don't miss them when
they leave."

Love and Tharpe will start. They'll join Cunningham, Ben Coleman, Anthony Redmon
and Ernest Dye, who had offseason shouldersurgery and practiced for the first
time this week.

"The coaching staff went out and put together a solid offensive line, and that's
probably going to be the difference," Centers said.

"That's where a solid offense starts."

Ryan got quarterback Dave Krieg, 36, who enjoyed one of his best seasons at
Detroit last year, to run a system that allows Krieg freedom to change plays.
The Cardinals traded Ron Moore along with first- and fourth-round picks to the
New York Jets for wide receiver Rob Moore.

The big question is whether the Cardinals got their money's worth. Can Krieg and
Rob Moore do for the offense what linebacker Seth Joyner and defensive Clyde
Simmons did for the defense last year?

If the offense fails to produce, it won't be because of a lack of knowledge.
Ryan put the offense through a four-month camp and then a three-week "voluntary
camp."

"Buddy has made a commitment to the offense," says Cunningham. "He's letting us
go a little bit.

"If we can step up to the level of our defense, it's going to be a damn good
team."

Orlosky named to All-America third team

BYLINE: Times West Virginian, Fairmont

SECTION: SPORTS

LENGTH: 675 words


June 23--MORGANTOWN -- West Virginia University senior center Tyler Orlosky was
named to Athlon Sports' preseason All-America third team as announced by the
organization Wednesday.

Orlosky, who was named preseason All-Big 12 first-team center from the same
publication, is a Cleveland native and started all 13 games last season, seeing
action on more than 1,000 plays.

He helped pave the way for the offense to average 479.7 yards of total offense,
34.0 points, 228.2 rushing yards and 251.5 passing yards per game. The offense
ranked No. 17 nationally in rushing offense, No. 18 in first-down offense and
No. 23 in total offense.

A 2016 Rimington Trophy Award "watch list" nominee, Orlosky graded out 90
percent or better in all 13 games last season. The WVU rushing attack produced
200 or more yards in six games, 300 or more yards in three games and a
season-high 426 yards at Kansas. In the last six games of 2015, the rushing
offense averaged 251 yards per game and 499.3 yards of total offense.

In the Big 12, Orlosky is one of only two returning all-conference offensive
linemen from 2015 and is the only returning Big 12 lineman listed on the final
ranking of the Schneider Scale (ranks the best 25 lineman in the nation used for
the Outland Trophy).

--West Virginia University golfer Avery Schneider has been nominated for the
2016 Big 12 Male Sportsperson of the Year as announced by the league on
Wednesday.

Schneider, who played in nine tournaments for the Mountaineers, displayed his
integrity on the course earlier this season by self-reporting a penalty during
competition. Sitting at two under par and inside the top five while competing in
the Wolfpack Open in North Carolina last fall, Schneider inadvertently moved his
ball while searching for it in the woods. Though his competitors did not witness
the violation, he reported it to his playing group and took a one-stroke penalty
for his lone bogey of the round.

A native of New Albany, Ohio, Schneider boasts a 4.0 GPA as a biology major and
won the 2016 WVU Golf Academic Achievement Award. He has earned mention on the
Garrett Ford Academic Honor Roll and Big 12 Commissioner's Honor Roll. In
addition, Schneider participates in a number of community-service activities
each year with the WVU golf team including projects at the Children's Library
and visiting patients at WVU Children's Hospital.

Staying sharp for Texas;
Sooners face a test;
High-octane Tulsa will challenge OU defense

BYLINE: Jake Trotter

SECTION: SPORTS MONDAY; OU INSIDER; Pg. 8B

LENGTH: 380 words

DATELINE: NORMAN


NORMAN - Three games.

Three wins.

Three bad offenses.

So far, Oklahoma's defense has manhandled North Texas, Miami and Utah State -
offenses ranked among the worst in college football this and last season,
offenses that don't sharpen a defense.

With Texas just three weeks away in a make-or-break showdown, OU's talented
defense needs to be sharp.

Friday, the Sooner defense will see how it stacks up against a better offense
when OU travels to Tulsa to face the Golden Hurricane's high-powered attack.

Late Saturday night, Tulsa made a stout Brigham Young defense look porous as the
Golden Hurricane racked up 595 yards in a 55-47 victory.

Last week, OU defensive coordinator Brent Venables raved about Tulsa's
no-huddle, hurry-up scheme brought in by former Arkansas coordinator Gus
Malzahn.

And that offense, behind senior quarterback Paul Smith, carved up the Cougars,
who had the 10th-best defense last year and held Arizona to just a touchdown in
the opener.

Tulsa is scoring 45 points a game running a scheme, shared by the Longhorns,
that relies on operating both the run and pass out of the shotgun.

OU needs to capitalize off playing against a competent offense to hone its
defense for Texas.

The Sooners' first three opponents and Colorado - OU's opponent after Tulsa -
are lousy offensively.

North Texas scored 31 points against Southern Methodist, but ranked 115th in the
country in scoring last year and against OU somehow made Utah State look like
Warren Moon's Houston Oilers.

That's impressive, because the Aggies finished 117th in offense last season and
are ranked just 116th this year.

And as good as Miami's defense is, the offense has been horrible of late.

Last year, the Hurricanes ranked 87th in scoring, but only because Miami scored
a combined 86 points against Florida A&M and Florida International.

Without those totals, Miami would've ranked 108th.

Miami might be worse, too, this year, managing just 23 points this time against
FIU.

Colorado can't score either, putting up just six points at home Saturday in a
loss to Florida State.

Texas may be struggling but the Longhorns still have pop, scoring 30 points a
game.

OU's first three games don't mean much. The Tulsa tune-up will serve as the
benchmark for how dominant this Sooner defense can be.

Winning Teams Pass on Rushing

BYLINE: By ANDY BENOIT

SECTION: Section B; Column 0; Sports Desk; Pg. 12

LENGTH: 289 words


Last season's Super Bowl pitted the N.F.L.'s 23rd-ranked rushing offense
(Pittsburgh) against the 32nd-ranked rushing offense (Arizona).  If that didn't
convince  fans that the importance of the running game is a distant second to
the passing game, then here is   more evidence:

This season, the teams with the top eight passing offenses, in terms of yards
per game, all have winning records. Seven of them are 6-3 or better: 1.
Indianapolis (9-0); 2. New England (6-3); 3. Houston (5-4); 4. New Orleans
(9-0); 5. Arizona (6-3); 6. Dallas (6-3); 7. San Diego (6-3); and 8. Pittsburgh
(6-3).

The chart below is another demonstration of the primacy of passing.

So is running irrelevant? Of course not. The Saints are undefeated in large part
because their fifth-ranked rushing attack has stabilized their perennially
high-powered offense. And just two years ago, the Giants won a Super Bowl behind
the league's No. 4-ranked ground game. But the 2009 numbers can't be ignored.
Passing is king.

Missing the Points

How about a rule change? After the Dolphins' Ronnie Brown scored on a 1-yard
touchdown run early in the first quarter against Tampa Bay, Miami kicker Dan
Carpenter had his extra point blocked. Tampa Bay's Geno Hayes caught the ball
and headed for the other goal line. The crowd started to roar. Then whistles
blew. Everyone stopped. The defense cannot score on a point-after attempt. Those
are the rules.

It had the same feel as when a security guard takes away a beach ball at a
concert. Why kill the fun?

In college football, a turnover on an extra point can be returned for a 2-point
defensive score. Why doesn't the N.F.L. adopt this rule? It would just add one
more element of strategy and excitement.  ANDY BENOIT

Offence charges onto the field;
Defence used to be stressed, DAVID NAYLOR says, but scoring has come back this
season

BYLINE: DAVID NAYLOR

SECTION: SPORTS; FOOTBALL NFL PLAYOFFS; Pg. S1

LENGTH: 1283 words


It's often noted that defence, particularly in the National Football League,
wins championships. And there are plenty of recent examples to back that up.

The Baltimore Ravens, Tampa Bay Buccaneers and even the New England Patriots got
to the top of the football world in the past four years largely on defence.

But as this year's playoffs get set to kick off on wild-card weekend, it is
offences that stand out most among the teams competing for a shot at Super Bowl
XXXIX in Jacksonville, Fla., on Feb. 6.

This weekend's four games feature six of the league's top eight offences,
including five of the top six passing teams in the league.

Which is why many anticipate that the traditional-style playoff game, in which
teams battle for field position for great lengths of time, may be the exception
and not the rule this year.

"There's differences of opinion, [should you] run the ball and keep the opposing
team off the field or score points?" Green Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre
asked. "What's more important? I say score. There's no substitute for scoring
points. If you score every time you get it, it would be hard for the opposing
team to beat you."

Tomorrow's Packers-Minnesota Vikings game in the National Football Conference
features a match-up of the third-ranked and fourth-ranked offences in the NFL,
two teams that produced 130 points in 120 minutes of football during the season.

"We assume - as they've done the last two games against us - that Minnesota will
score a lot of points," Favre said. "I don't see why we would think
differently."

For most of this NFL season, Favre's philosophy of scoring as often and fast as
possible worked throughout the league. Certainly, the NFL's rule crackdown on
illegal contact on receivers made successes out of teams that went for it and
did so often. Nine of the top 10 offences in the league qualified for postseason
play, with the Kansas City Chiefs the exception.

Only the Atlanta Falcons made the postseason while finishing in the bottom half
of league in offence - although the Falcons possess quarterback Michael Vick,
perhaps the league's most explosive offensive player.

Several of the league's stingiest clubs - the Buffalo Bills, Washington
Redskins, Tampa Bay and Baltimore, all ranked among the top six defensively -
did not make the playoffs.

Meanwhile, defences such as those in Indianapolis, Seattle, Minnesota and Green
Bay - all in the bottom quarter of the league - will have to step things up to
give their teams a shot of making it to Jacksonville.

For teams such as the New York Jets, whose offence has struggled for consistency
of late, there is great pressure to get things on track. Especially since the
Jets today take on the surprising San Diego Chargers, whose quarterback, Drew
Brees, is the NFL's comeback player of the year.

The Chargers were held to fewer than 20 points in a game just twice all season.
That was largely thanks to Brees, and two of the most prolific offensive players
in the NFL today - running back LaDainian Tomlinson and tight end Antonio Gates.

Tomlinson, whom San Diego head coach Marty Schottenheimer calls the best back
he's ever seen, rushed for 1,335 yards this season and added 441 receiving,
while Gates, largely unknown before this season, caught 13 touchdown passes,
nine more than any of the other Chargers.

"You take LaDainian and use him as a receiver and you put him out - there is no
linebacker that is going to cover LaDainian," Schottenheimer said of today's
American Football Conference match-up.

"Well, then if you are going to take Antonio and split him out, somebody has to
cover him outside the framework of the core of the offensive unit."

With so many teams capable of scoring, coaches understand the importance of
getting into the end zone when opportunity knocks. Even teams such as the Jets,
the third best defence in the playoffs but with a tendency to be very
conservative on offence, are feeling the pressure to score.

"When we get in the red zone, we have to score points," New York head coach
Herman Edwards said.

"When we move the ball, we have not been able to put the points on the board,
and that's what you have to do when you get in the playoffs because you know
it's vital."

"They are scoring about 28 a game [overall], and at home they are scoring about
32. So whether that happens in the playoffs or not, I don't know, but that's the
numbers they have been scoring. If you're going to compete with them, it's got
to be in the 20s."

The other AFC game features Indianapolis, the league's second best offence
against Denver, which ranked sixth. The Colts, behind the throwing magic of
Peyton Manning, broke the 30-point mark in six out of eight home games, four
times going over the 40 mark.

"[Against] a team like Indy, you can't make a lot of mistakes because they're so
explosive on offence," Denver head coach Mike Shanahan said. "If you get behind
and get behind early, especially in that environment with the crowd noise, [the
Colts' defence] can cause a lot of offences problems. It's one of the reasons
why they're leading the league in turnover ratio."

Meanwhile, the other NFC game, the Seattle Seahawks against the St. Louis Rams,
features another two teams that are among the leaders in offence but in the
lower half defensively.

Defence first?

"There's differences of opinion, [should you] run the ball and keep the opposing
team off the field or scor points?  What's more important? I say score.  There's
no substitute for scoring points.

-Green Bay quarterback Brett Favre.

Wild weekend

TODAY

St. Louis Rams (8-8)

at Seattle Seahawks (9-7)

The momentum: The Rams won their final two home games after quarterback Marc
Bulger returned from shoulder injury, but dropped five in a row on the road
before that. Seahawks lost three of four in late November and early December
before closing with wins over hapless Arizona and Atlanta in a meaningless game
for the Falcons.

The challenge: The Rams' defence (ranked 29th against run) must stop Seattle's
Shaun Alexander. Seattle must continue to neutralize St. Louis's top receiver,
Tory Holt, who had just seven catches in two games against the Seahawks this
season.

New York Jets (10-6)

at San Diego Chargers (12-4)

The momentum: Coming off a 4-12 season in 2003-04, the Chargers won nine of
their final 10 games this season, the only loss coming in overtime at
Indianapolis on Dec. 26. Jets quarterback Chad Pennington is just 2-5 since
returning from a shoulder injury midway through the season. The Jets opened the
season 5-0 and closed it 5-6.

The challenge: The San Diego defence (third against the run) will try to limit
the effectiveness of New York's Curtis Martin. The Jets must try to negate
Chargers tight end Antonio Gates, who was a touchdown machine during regular
season.

TOMORROW

Denver Broncos (10-6)

at Indianapolis Colts (12-4)

The momentum: The Colts won eight in a row before last week's meaningless loss
to Denver. After going to 5-1 as of Oct. 17, the Broncos failed to win more than
two in a row the rest of the way.

The challenge: The Colts' defence (31st against the run) must shut down Broncos
running back Reuben Droughns. Denver must find avoid turnovers against a team
that led the league with 36 takeaways.

Minnesota Vikings (8-8)

at Green Bay Packers (10-6)

The momentum: The Vikings lost four of their final five games and seven of 10
after a 5-1 start. They are just 2-20 in their past 22 outdoor games. The
Packers overcame a 1-4 start to finish 9-2.

The challenge: If Green Bay can run early against Minnesota, it would create
big-day potential in the passing game. The biggest challenge for the Vikings may
be simply to believe they can win.

GEORGIA RECRUITING NOTEBOOK: Top prospect Respert arrested on Fla. visit

BYLINE: Chip Towers, Andy Staples, Staff

LENGTH: 311 words

Georgia's top high school offensive line prospect was arrested and charged with
attempted sexual battery and burglary of a residence Saturday during his
official visit to the University of Florida.

Jason Respert, an offensive tackle from Northside High in Warner Robins, was
charged with the two second-degree felonies after a Gainesville woman accused
him of entering her apartment and fondling her while she slept, according to a
Gainesville police report. Respert was in the Alachua County Jail on Saturday
night.

If convicted, he could face up to 30 years in prison and up to a $ 20,000 fine.

The 6-foot-4, 301-pound Respert committed to Georgia earlier this month but
backed off his commitment to consider Tennessee and Florida. The Florida trip
was Respert's final official visit before national signing day on Wednesday.

According to the report, Respert entered the woman's apartment through an
unlocked door at about 6:15 a.m. Saturday.  He was arrested at 2:55 p.m. in the
conference room at Florida Field. No current Florida players were involved in
the incident.

Still counting

Just one recruit visited Georgia over the weekend --- offensive lineman Alex
Barron of Orangeburg, S.C. --- but several other top-rated players still list
Georgia as a finalist.

Among them are Orlando offensive lineman Max Starks, linebacker Brooks Daniels
of Jasper, Fla.; defensive back Tre Orr of Lake City, Fla.; wide receiver Kelvin
Kight of Lithonia, defensive lineman Albert Means of Memphis, offensive lineman
Sean Young of Cohutta and offensive lineman Maurice Mitchell of Albany.

"I can't remember this many elite players still being on the board this late,
and a lot of them are going to wait until signing day," said Jamie Newberg of
Borderwars.com. "Georgia won't get them all, but they'll get some of them. Coach
Donnan always closes fast."

UW offensive trio making its mark

Hed: UW offensive trio making its mark

Quick, name the only two Mountain West schools to have a quarterback, receiver
and running back ranked in the top six of their individual categories through
the first seven weeks of the season.

Fresno State? Nope.

Nevada? Wrong.

Utah State? Incorrect.

The correct answer is your University of Wyoming Cowboys and the Boise State
Broncos.

Junior quarterback Brett Smith, junior wide receiver Dominic Rufran and
sophomore running back Shaun Wick rank third, third and sixth, respectively, in
the conference. Only BSU's Joe Southwick, Shane Williams-Rhodes and Jay Ajayi
can make the same claim.

For the Pokes, Smith, Rufran and Wick might not be the next coming of the Three
Amigos, but they're certainly the engine that keeps the UW offense running.

Smith is averaging 309.0 passing yards a game this season (third in the MW) and
379 total yards of offense (second). Rufran averages 7.0 receptions a game
(third), and Wick averages 79.7 yards on the ground (sixth).

The trio leads an offense that ranks second in the MW in total offense and third
in scoring, rushing, passing and first downs.

The UW offense is on pace to produce one of the greatest seasons in school
history.

And it all starts with Smith, Wick and Rufran.

In UW coach Dave Christensen's up-tempo, spread offense - whether it's in
Laramie or during his time as offensive coordinator at other schools - there's
always been something of a three-headed monster in place.

The Cowboys are no different.

Want proof? Easy.

Wyoming's worst half of football this season - outside of the opening 30 minutes
of the season at Nebraska - came in the second half at Texas State on Sept. 28
in San Marcos, Texas. That night, UW totaled 163 yards and seven points in the
second half in a 42-21 loss to the Bobcats.

What happened in that game, outside of a horrible thunderstorm that delayed the
game more than three hours late in the second quarter? Wyoming played the second
half without Rufran due to an injury and with a limited Wick due to a coaching
decision.

And UW's offense nearly shut down.

Certainly Wyoming's offense isn't solely limited to its version of the Three
Amigos, but it's also clear by what happened that night in Texas that when
Smith/Wick/Rufran aren't all on the field at the same time the Wyoming offense
isn't as productive.

The Cowboys will also need everything the three have coming down the stretch.

Following Saturday's Border War home game against Colorado State, the Pokes will
face by far their toughest stretch of the season over the next month.

First comes a road game at San Jose on Oct. 26 against a Spartans team that
hasn't lived up to some lofty preseason expectations but is still dangerous at
home.

Following a bye week, Wyoming hosts Fresno State on Nov. 9 and plays at Boise
State on Nov. 16 in games that will go a long way toward deciding who will be
playing in the Mountain West championship game Dec. 7.

Wyoming will need all hands on deck for this stretch, but will need Smith, Wick
and Rufran leading the charge.

Where this trio goes down in Wyoming football history remains a work in
progress. Certainly the trios of Josh Wallwork/Marcus Harris/Marques Brigham and
Casey Bramlet/Malcom Floyd/Derek Armah rank among the best in school history.

But with the second half of this season and another full year remaining, it's
clear that the trifecta of Smith/Rufran/Wick has the potential to be among the
best in a rich offensive history at Wyoming.

Somebody might need to come up with a nickname for these three.

The floor is open to suggestions.

No offense, but Belichick embraces boring game plan

BYLINE: Bryan Burwell

SECTION: SPORTS; COMMENTARY; Pg. 4C

LENGTH: 629 words

DATELINE: CLEVELAND


The ball hung in the air like an overinflated blimp. It stayed up so long,
Dorothy could have hitched a ride back to Kansas.

This was the Cleveland Browns' offense in high gear. Footballs fluttering
forever. Wheezing into the wrong hands. And those not fluttering were usually
making the Browns' receivers look like baseball infielders, protecting
themselves against a barrage of ugly, short-hopping nightmares.

And if the Browns' offense seemed an ugly sight, then the New Orleans Saints'
offense was the north end of a southbound mule.

Butt ugly.

All day long, Saints quarterback Wade Wilson was a man on skates. Going
backward. Going down. Going under a never-ending heap of sack-happy big men.
Michael Dean Perry and Jerry Ball roaring up the middle. Anthony Pleasant and
Rob Burnett rocking from the corners.

There was no offense in the Browns' 17-13 victory against New Orleans Sunday.
There was only a series of accidents sandwiched between a clutter of mistakes.

If beauty is in the eye of the beholder, then truly, the only one who could have
loved this one was Bill Belichick, the Browns' defensive-minded coach. His idea
of football perfection is an offense that can master the fine and grossly
underappreciated art of the very obvious draw play and a defense that makes
enough big plays to keep the offense from having to do anything crazy like
actually taking over a game.

Low-risk, yawn-inducing offenses and big-play, aggressive defenses. Belichick
saw it work for two Super Bowl victories while he was with the New York Giants.
And now, the public be damned, he is shoving this same ultra-conservative
approach to the folks in Cleveland.

The only problem with his concept for the last five weeks has been that Vinny
Testaverde - the quarterback willing to accept this offense-in-shackles concept
- was on the injured list.

But now Testaverde is back, the four-game losing streak is over, and, at least
for one gloriously boring, gray December day on the shore of Lake Erie, no one
was calling for Belichick's scalp or Bernie Kosar's return.

If the Browns are going to dig themselves out of this terrible hole, if they are
ever going to find a way to go from 6-6 into the AFC playoffs, it won't be with
a wide-open offense lighting up the scoreboard like a video game.

"For our team? Yeah, it was the perfect game," said Ball, Cleveland's rotund
defensive tackle and part-time fullback. "The defense is the strong side of the
ball for us. But if you go to San Francisco or Miami, they don't worry about the
defense. The offense is in control. They put the points up there. They control
the situation. But for us, yeah, you bet, this is the way things have to go."

So this is how the Browns do it.

They will bore you to no end when they have the ball. They do not seem to care
that they have one of the most dangerous offensive players in the game in Eric
Metcalf. He gets four rushing carries all day.

He catches one pass.

Basically, all they do with him is let him return kicks and punts, and when they
think about him once or twice a half, they let him do something with the
offense.

But not too much.

Midway through the third quarter, on his fourth carry of the game (can you
believe he had only touched the ball four times up to that point?), Metcalf
turned a routine handoff up the middle into a 55-yard gain that set up the
game-winning score.

And then he went back to being the invisible man.

But look around the NFL. What's happening in Cleveland is happening all over the
league. Offenses are turning into sludge.

Without the San Francisco 49ers, who had almost 100 more points than the NFL's
second-highest scoring team entering Sunday's games, the rest of the league
looks like rugby.

Rugby without the frills.

PRO FOOTBALL;
No-Huddle Means No Time For Jets' Defense to Adjust

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY W. SMITH,  Special to The New York Times

SECTION: Section B; Page 32; Column 1; Sports Desk

LENGTH: 806 words

DATELINE: HEMPSTEAD, L.I., Oct. 7


The Jets' defense, reshuffled to compensate for injuries to defensive ends Jeff
Lageman and Dennis Byrd, took a deep breath going into last week's game against
New England.

The players acquitted themselves admirably, coming up with seven sacks and two
interceptions, in the Jets' first victory of the season. Now, the Jets' defense
can't exhale.

The Colts, using the no-huddle offense brought from Buffalo by the new coach,
Ted Marchibroda, will present the Jets' defense with little breathing room when
the two teams meet Sunday (4 P.M.) at the Indianapolis Hoosier Dome. And that
could be crucial considering the Jets' propensity for rotating fresh players on
the defensive line.

"It inhibits us from substituting as much as we normally would," said Jets
defensive tackle Paul Frase. "If a guy gets winded you have to stick it out for
a few extra plays before you can get somebody else in there. With the no-huddle
it's obviously harder to get a guy in off the sidelines."

Familiar-Looking Offense

Jets Coach Bruce Coslet isn't worried about matching up against the Colts'
no-huddle offense. The Jets have seen the offense twice a year for the last two
years against Buffalo.

The Colts, like Buffalo, run their no-huddle with three wide receivers, one
running back and one tight end, and they do everything, including third-and-long
and short-yardage situations, from the set. Because the offensive personnel
remains constant throughout a drive, and because the offense gets back to the
line of scrimmage quickly, it doesn't allow defenses easy substitutions. .

But Coslet said the Indianapolis offense is not the same type of no-huddle that
Cincinnati ran when he was the offensive coordinator with the Bengals.

"They call plays and go," he said. "They don't try to quick snap if you try to
change personnel or anything like that. We'll match up with what they put on the
field and play."

The Colts don't have the same talent in their no-huddle attack that the Bills
have. Indianapolis's version of Bills running back Thurman Thomas is Anthony
Johnson. Colts receivers Jessie Hester and Bill Brooks take the roles of the
Bills' James Lofton and Andre Reed. And Colts tight end Kevin Call acts as Bills
tight end Keith Metzelaars.

Marchibroda was delicate when talking about the differences between the
personnel in Buffalo's no-huddle and the Colts' offense.

"The no-huddle is the no-huddle," Marchibroda said. "What we have to do in
Indianapolis is what we feel our people can do best. That's what we did in
Buffalo."

The main thing that the Colts' no-huddle has going for it is quarterback Jeff
George. He is such an integral part of what the Colts are doing with the
no-huddle that they did not use the offense while George was out for the first
three games of the season because of torn ligaments in his right thumb.

"It was something that we worked on in preseason and training camp," Marchibroda
said. "Jeff George received the majority of the work. When he got hurt we
definitely couldn't use it. We waited until he got healthy again."

Last week against the Buccaneers in Tampa, Fla., George got his first
opportunity to run the offense. He got off to a shaky start, completing just
3-of-13 pass attempts and throwing two interceptions in the first half. He
didn't remind anyone of Bills quarterback Jim Kelly. But he warmed to the
offense in the second half, completing 12 of 20 for 177 yards two touchdowns and
one interception and led the Colts to a surprising 24-14 victory and lifted
their record to 2-2 for the season.

George, one of the most harried quarterbacks in the league last year, getting
sacked 56 times, likes operating with the no-huddle.

"The main thing is having the flexibility of calling your own plays," George
said. "I'm not so sure it's an advantage. It just tires a lot of people out. Not
only our guys but the defense gets tired. And you're able to do more.

"It was tough last week in Tampa because of the heat. The main thing is that
you're not able to do a lot of substituting on offense or defense and you're
able to do a lot more."

EXTRA POINTS


 Receiver ROB MOORE, who didn't practice Wednesday, is the only Jets player on
the injury report. Moore is listed as probable for the Colts game this Sunday
because of a bruised knee. . . . Strong safety BRIAN WASHINGTON (sore shoulder)
also didn't practice Wednesday. . . . The Jets waived tight end ERIC KATTUS and
activated rookie tackle SIUPELI MALAMALA, out with a shoulder injury, from
injured reserve. Tight end JOHNNY MITCHELL (shoulder injury) was activated from
injured reserve to the practice squad. . . . Cornerback TONY STARGELL (knee
injury), the Jets' third-round pick in 1990 who was cut before the start of the
season and picked up by the Colts, is listed as questionable for the game.

Johnson sure offense works

BYLINE: MARK BRADLEY; Staff

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 1E

LENGTH: 581 words


Paul Johnson smiled as he spoke, but only once or twice and not for long.
Regarding his stylized offense and the incessant questioning thereof, he said,
"It's past the point of being anything other than amusing."

Johnson has been a head coach for 11 seasons. He has been running the same
offense --- the Georgia Tech press guide calls it an "option-based spread" ---
even longer. He has won 73.3 percent of his games using the thing, so what do
you expect him to say? That his offense doesn't and won't function when every
shred of statistical evidence suggests it can and does?

"As soon as we lose a game," Johnson said Saturday, speaking at Tech's media
day, "[the offense] is going to be [seen as] the reason we lost."

Then: "If you don't execute and you put the ball on the ground, it doesn't work.
But you can look back on last year [when Tech played under Chan Gailey, who was
fired] and say the pro-style offense doesn't work, either."

Yes, Johnson is more than a bit sensitive. You'd be, too. You create an offense
and win big with it at two places where winning is more a function of creative
coaching than of five-star recruits, and still there are those who insist his
system will go broke in the ACC.

Johnson: "What division are we in, the NFC East? At the Naval Academy we played
Maryland and Wake Forest and Duke and Rutgers and Notre Dame and Boston College
and Pitt --- it's not like those schools are in some different division than we
are. Duke has lost a lot of games using a pro-style offense, so does that mean
it doesn't work --- or that it just didn't work at Duke? Virginia Tech won our
league using the same offense we run."

For all the peripheral talk of limitations and liabilities, the proper focus at
Tech should be on opportunity. The ACC is in such flux that Wake Forest now
seems a sounder program than Miami or Florida State, and that's an indication of
what one splendid coach can do. Johnson is a splendid coach who has access to
resources foreign to him at Georgia Southern and Navy. Here he'll have both big
linemen and speed. Here he'll be able to run his stylized offense at an even
higher level.

"People say [the opponents] will have too much speed," Johnson said. "We ran
this offense for six years at the Naval Academy, and I can promise you our kids
here are faster than those were."

For all the success enjoyed by West Virginia and Virginia Tech and other
converts to the spread option, nobody knows more about its workings than
Johnson. He invented it 24 years ago when working as an offensive coordinator
under Erk Russell at Georgia Southern, and those Eagles won two Division I-AA
championships. (Upon returning to GSU as head coach in the '90s, Johnson would
win two more.)

"I've never had much skepticism," said Johnson, speaking of his offense. "If I
had, I wouldn't do it."

It will take awhile for Tech fans to grow accustomed to the new look, but that's
part of the system's beauty. It's exponentially harder for an opponent to
prepare for the exotic. (Ask Georgia about Troy, which gained 145 more yards
against the Bulldogs last year than Florida and Tim Tebow had the week before.)

"In my mind, it's been proved that this offense will work," said Johnson, and
not just in his mind but, over the past quarter-century, on various fields of
play. Soon enough, it will work at Tech. It will work because Paul Johnson will
make it work.

Let the games begin: Official condom chosen

BYLINE: By Chuck Shepherd

   In November, officials announced that Ortho McNeil Co. condoms will be the
official condoms of the 1994 Commonwealth Games in Victoria, B.C. The Games will
feature athletes from 66 nations.

LOVED HIM TO DEATH: Carmen Friedewald-Hill, 26, was sentenced in November to 20
years in prison in Frederick, Md., for shooting boyfriend Ryan Gesner to death.
She shot him in the stomach during an argument over who loved the other more.

THE POLICE BLOTTER

* In July, New York City police charged a 16-year-old named Eddie with sexual
assault and attempted murder of his stepmother, but released him two days later
when an investigation revealed it was his twin brother Jesus who should have
been charged. The stepmother said she could not tell the boys apart and was not
sure which one assaulted her. DNA testing was useless since both Eddie and Jesus
have the same genes.

* In March, in response to a citizen complaint, a San Diego police vice squad
officer persuaded the owner of DeRay's, a sexy-costume shop, to remove some of
the stuffing in the crotch of the swimsuited male mannequins in its window.

* In July, the Cook Islands, which gained independence from New Zealand in 1965
and are home to 18,000 people, reported their very first armed robbery. A local
man took about $24,000 from a hotel, but was quickly captured.

* In separate incidents in March, police in Washington, D.C., and south San
Francisco arrested men they encountered running down the street who aroused
suspicion because they were carrying cash registers. One was charged with
robbing a convenience store, the other with burglarizing a bakery.

* In November, Quebecer Andre Guay, 34, was arrested in Dickson, Tenn., and
charged with various traffic violations. Guay has black wavy hair and was
dressed in black, with black chrome-tipped boots and a black jacket with the
words "Elvis Lives" on it. He told police he was distraught over marital
problems and decided to visit Graceland, but said that made him even more
depressed.

* In July, thieves with a blowtorch broke into an unmarked tractor-trailer
parked at an Orlando, Fla., motel and stole bags containing 400,000 quarters
while a guard slept in the truck's cab. Police said the loot was so heavy it
would have been difficult even for two large cars to carry it off.

Cowboys OK with Walsh or Lunt

BYLINE: Gina Mizell

SECTION: SPORTS; OSU FOOTBALL NOTEBOOK; Pg. 3C

LENGTH: 482 words



The most popular topic surrounding Oklahoma State this week continues to be the
quarterback position, with starter Wes Lunt doubtful to play in Saturday's Big
12 opener against No. 12 Texas because of a knee injury - despite coach Mike
Gundy hinting that Lunt could practice by the end of the week - and J.W. Walsh
likely to make his first-career start against the Longhorns.

But to offensive lineman Lane Taylor and running back Jeremy Smith, it doesn't
really matter who is taking snaps.

"They just tell us to block, and we just block," Taylor said. "It doesn't really
change much of what we do. They just call the play, and we try to perform."

Added Smith: "We're pretty much just like, 'Give us the ball.'"

Lunt has completed 68 percent of his passes for 588 yards, four touchdowns and
three interceptions in, essentially, five quarters of work. Walsh has completed
66.7 percent of his throws for 496 yards, six touchdowns and one interception
and directed an offense that put up a school-record 742 total yards in its last
game against Louisiana-Lafayette.

OPPONENT WATCH

Saturday night's game in Stillwater is a much-anticipated Big 12 contest. But
it's only the beginning of a tough road for UT, especially the Longhorns'
defense.

After OSU, the Longhorns face three more of the conference's high-powered
offenses in West Virginia, Oklahoma and Baylor.

All of those teams rank in the top 30 in the nation in scoring offense and total
offense.

"If we're going to show what type of team we are," safety Kenny Vaccaro told the
Austin American-Statesman, "it's going to be in these next few weeks."

BY THE NUMBERS

Through the first four weeks of the college football season, the OSU offense
continues to statistically be one of the best in the country, while the Cowboys'
somewhat puzzling drop-off in turnovers forced is reflected in the NCAA
standings.

OSU ranks in the top six in the nation in scoring offense (first, 62.33 points
per game), total offense (first, 686.67 yards per game), red zone offense (tied
for first, 100 percent), passing offense (second, 378.33 yards per game) and
rushing offense (sixth, 308.33 yards per game).

On the flip side, a Cowboys team that led the nation in takeaways a year ago
(44) is tied for 102nd in the nation in that category (three) and is tied for
105th in turnover margin (minus-1.33 per game).

OSU also ranks near the bottom in penalties per game (tied for 97th, eight) and
yards penalized per game (tied for 115th, 84), mostly because of its 15 fouls
for a school-record 167 yards against Arizona.

CAMO UNIFORMS? NOT SO FAST

A report from OSU's SB Nation affiliate, Cowboys Ride for Free, surfaced Tuesday
evening that the Cowboys would debut new orange and black camouflage uniforms
and orange helmets against UT Saturday night.

But an Oklahoma State official all but squashed that report, saying he was
"fairly certain it's an Internet joke."

Your news Round Lake youth named All-American for football camp -BYLN- Submitted
by Offense-Defense All-American Bowl Committee

SECTION: NEIGHBOR; Pg. 2

LENGTH: 231 words


While attending an Offense-Defense Football Camp this summer, Logan Jared, 11,
of Round Lake was named an Offense-Defense All-American and invited to
participate in the eighth annual Offense-Defense Bowl Week festivities taking
place at the Citrus Bowl in Orlando, Fla.

Logan, a linebacker for the Grant Jr. Bulldogs, was selected for this honor from
a group of young athletes numbering in the thousands across the country and
played well representing the Grant community, easily validating the Bowl
Selection Committee's choice.

Logan was selected as an MVP for offensive line last year and played in the
seventh annual Offense-Defense Bowl game at the Houston Texans' Reliant Stadium.

The Offense-Defense Youth All-American Bowl is part of a weeklong series of
events, including the televised Offense-Defense All-American Bowl, an All-Star
football game showcasing 88 of the top high school seniors in the country, and
has featured current NFL pros such as Cam Newton, Carlos Dunlap, and Dez Bryant,
among others, before they were collegiate and later professional stars.

Offense-Defense Sports has been running full-contact football instructional
camps for the past 45 years and currently operates in approximately 40 camp
locations nationwide every spring and summer.

Is 10-second rule college football's answer?

BYLINE: Derek Redd

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. P1B

LENGTH: 797 words


The NCAA Football Rules Committee has suggested that, to keep offenses from
snapping the ball too early in the play clock, if they do, they should be
penalized ... with delay of game.

That should tell you all you need to know about the lazy, Luddite idea that
somehow crawled out of that meeting room.

In order to throw the brakes on the hot-rod offenses that have been growing in
number and popularity over the past few seasons, this committee has decided to
punish them by claiming the exact opposite of what they're designed to do --
delaying the college football game. That way, the chorus of loud, yet powerful
coaches bemoaning hurry-up offenses will get what they want without having to do

If you can't stop `em, legislate `em.

High-tempo offenses are among the equalizers available for teams without the
massive bankrolls of the Alabamas and the Arkansas of the world. Teams that,
unlike the Crimson Tide, can't afford to hire three directors of player
personnel, two directors of player development and eight "football analysts" ...
whatever those are.

I guess all those folks help them reel in the five-star 300-pound defensive
linemen. Well, the tempo offenses dare those behemoths to keep up their pace.
They also keep coaches from switching their defenses to best stop the offensive
formation they see before them.

Here's cfbstats.com's list of the 11 teams who ran the most plays last season,
in descending order: Texas Tech, BYU, Arizona State, Marshall, Fresno State,
Baylor, Northern Illinois, Utah State, Colorado State, California and Rice. Not
a lot of historical juggernauts in that group. Yet, among those 11, only Cal had
a losing record.

So who are among those stumping for a rule that prohibits teams from snapping
the ball no earlier than 11 seconds into a 40-second play clock? The two
Football Subdivision Coaches on the committee are Troy Calhoun of Air Force and
Todd Berry of Louisiana-Monroe. Arkansas coach Bret Bielema was at the meeting
as a non-voting representative of the American Football Coaches Association.
Alabama

Here is where those coaches' teams rank in plays run in 2013, according to
cfbstats: Louisiana-Monroe, 84th; Alabama, tied for 99th; Air Force, 106th;
Arkansas, 118th.

Can you see how those guys might have an issue with hurry-up offenses?

Now, most of those guys have claimed high-tempo offenses are a danger to player
safety, that defenders are more prone to injury when there isn't the opportunity
to easily substitute. Calhoun said just that in his comments following the
announcement of the committee's proposal.

All those boys are college coaches, which mean they have at least a tangential
relationship to higher education. So here's my challenge to them, one that
they've heard since third-grade math class.

Show your work.

You claim the difficulty in substituting players leads to more injuries? Plop
the study down on the table that proves that. Do more than just say it leads to
an increase in injury. Offer concrete proof. Otherwise, it just sounds like a
bunch of guys whining that they can no longer stay on top of college football's
mountain based solely on the depth of their pockets.

The committee also claims that the ball was snapped on the vast majority of
plays last year long past that 10-second substitution window, so the proposed
rule would have minimal effect on offenses. Well, if it isn't really a problem,
why are they creating a rule to change it?

That's like banishing shampoo from a bald man's shower.

If football coaches want to combat hurry-up offenses, why not do it in their own
meeting rooms and not in a rules committee meeting room? Can't Saban assign one
of his army of football analysts to come up with a solution?

The game evolves and coaches evolve their game plans to keep up. That's what
Marshall offensive coordinator Bill Legg did when he started running a tempo
offense. It's what Marshall defensive coordinator Chuck Heater did when he went
to the nickel as his base package. He saw the growth in spread offenses,
realized there were more athletes on the offensive side of the field and decided
to

Yet it seems that coaches like Saban and Bielema simply are content to turn back
the clock on college football, both literally and figuratively. Are they also
waiting for recruits to call them on their last-century brick-sized mobile
phones while listening to Duran Duran's greatest hits on their Sony Discmans?

And here's an idea: If college coaches want to inhibit the evolution of
football, how about they go throwback themselves, to the time when football
programs were run out of an office in the physical education department?

Gators preparing to launch an offensive;
UF's new coach, Jim McElwain, no stranger to SEC

BYLINE: Garry Smits

SECTION: Pg. D-1

LENGTH: 775 words


If it's offense University of Florida athletic director Jeremy Foley wants from
his new football coach, it's offense he'll get.

Jim McElwain, who was named the Gators' new coach on Thursday, has played and
coached nothing but that side of the ball ever since he was an all-state
quarterback at Sentinel High School in Missoula, Mont., then later at Eastern
Washington.

His specialty has been coaching quarterbacks and receivers, so his inclination
is to throw the football. If he can do that at Florida with any kind of
efficiency and success, he likely will please Gator fans used to the
high-powered attacks that won SEC and national championships under Steve
Spurrier and Urban Meyer.

Florida finished out of the top 100 in total offense in the first three years
under Will Muschamp, and was 90th this season.

By contrast, McElwain's Colorado State Rams are 13th in the nation in offense
this season with 497.8 yards per game and are 12th or higher in other categories
such as passing yardage per game (326.3 yards, seventh); team passing efficiency
(167.66 rating, third); and third-down conversion rate (.512, seventh).

McElwain also was the offensive coordinator for Alabama from 2008-2011, a time
period in which the Tide won two national championships and had a 48-6 record.

One of the quarterbacks he coached there, Greg McElroy, told espn.com: "Gator
fans should rejoice."

Foley said McElwain's offensive skills and his reputation as a solid recruiter
will build an offense that will keep up with the modern college game.

"He has a proven track record on the offensive side of the ball, has coached in
the SEC, won two national championships and has had success as a head coach,"
Foley said in a statement. "He has recruited the South and the state of Florida
... [and] has an engaging personality."

What will a McElwain offense potentially look like, given the talent he already
has and what he will bring to Florida?

- It will throw the football downfield: Colorado State was not a West Coast
offense with a horizontal passing game. The team averaged 14.77 yards per
completion, 12th in the nation.

- It will be efficient: Rams quarterback Garrett Grayson was second in the
nation in passer rating (171.3), behind only likely Heisman Trophy winner Marcus
Mariota of Oregon, and threw for 32 touchdowns and was intercepted only six
times. The two Alabama quarterbacks McElwain coached, A.J. McCarron and McElroy,
are Nos. 1 and 2 in school history for the lowest interception rate and McElroy
holds the school record for career completion percentage (.669).

- It will be balanced. Grayson has thrown for 3,779 yards, fifth in the nation.
His favorite target, Rashad Higgins, leads the nation with 1,640 receiving yards
(on 89 receptions). But the Rams still found a way to have a 1,000-yard rusher,
Dee Hart, who ran for 1,254 yards and scored 16 touchdowns. CSU threw 412 passes
and ran the ball 416 times.

- McElwain is not close-minded. He has coached both spread offenses and
pro-style offenses. He will tailor his system to the talent he has.

- He will develop talent, and do it quickly. Alabama's two national
championships with McElwain as the coordinator were won with first-year starting
quarterbacks, McElroy as a junior in 2009 and McCarron as a sophomore in 2011.
That may lead to optimism that McElwain can help the talented but inaccurate
Treon Harris, or bring along Will Grier.

"Mac's greatest strength is that he's a tremendous teacher of the game," St.
Louis Rams offensive lineman Barrett Jones told espn.com. "He has a special
ability to put things in terms that guys can understand. He's also great at
getting guys to buy into the system and understands how to put guys in positions
where they will be successful."

Florida fans had an unpleasant taste of McElwain's offensive scheme during his
time at Alabama. The Tide went 3-1 against the Gators during that span,
averaging 30.25 points per game.

One of victories was in the 2009 SEC championship, when Heisman Trophy
quarterback Tim Tebow was a senior. Alabama won 32-13 against the top-ranked
defense in the nation, piling up 490 total yards and snapping the Gators'
22-game winning streak.

Alabama had its three top seasons of total offense to that point in school
history with McElwain calling the plays.

YES, BUT HOW?

BYLINE: MARTIN FENNELLY

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 573 words

DATELINE: JACKSONVILLE



HIGHLIGHT: Sure, the Gators have a solid defense, but can it continue to carry
them?


We can call it a mirage. We can say it will come crashing down, maybe as soon as
next week in Fayetteville against Arkansas, or Nov. 19 in Baton Rouge against
Presbyterian's evil twin, LSU. Or for sure, if they get that far, if they get to
Atlanta, against Lord Saban in the SEC Championship Game.

Yes, there's no way Florida's Gators can get anywhere with this creaky offense.

Gators coach Jim McElwain listened to all the questions.

"Did we win?" McElwain said. "I just want to make sure."

They won. Florida beat Georgia 24-10, the Gators' third straight win over the
Bulldogs. Florida is deeply flawed and Georgia isn't any good. There's that. But
there's this, too: Florida is 6-1 overall, 4-1 and in first place in the SEC
East, where it controls its own destiny, and technically - with a capital T - is
in the playoff hunt. Insert a laugh track if you want. Or look for smoke and
mirrors.

The Gators have a shot right up until they don't.

Those are the rules.

Florida won Saturday with defense and more defense, the only thing it has,
holding Georgia to 164 yards, including 21 on the ground. Good thing, because
quarterback Luke Del Rio and the Florida offense managed only 231 yards. It's
hard to believe Florida can make a second straight SEC title game with this
wretched offense.

Then again, Florida made it last year with one of the more horrific offenses in
recent memory. This Gators offense is a lot better statistically than last
year's - and this offense in terrible.

Last year the Gators were smashed in their final three games, by Florida State,
Alabama and Michigan, getting outscored 97-24.

Sometimes I think we forget that those Gators won 10 games in McElwain's first
season.

Del Rio's first pass of his Florida-Georgia career was an interception. There
was no way around that, or the fact that he was wild all day, or that Florida
struggled mightily at running the ball. I'm not even sure Del Rio will be the
starter next season. Or that this offense won't cost the Gators when they run
into the SEC West in coming weeks.

Does the head coach really believe his team can go places with the defense
carrying the offense?

"Sure," McElwain said. "I believe we can. I believe we have the ingredients,
both offensively and defensively and on special teams, to make a heck of a run."

At times, Florida's defense will make you believe anything is possible. Take
away that 35-point second half in Knoxville and we'd talk about these dudes in
reverent awe. This defense is winning games.

It entered play Saturday ranked second to only Michigan in total defense and
scoring defense, and it played like it once it contained Georgia quarterback
Jacob Eason.

Nick Chubb was held to 20 yards on nine carries. Helping lead the way for the
Gators were defensive linemen Caleb Brantley, Khairi Clark and Jabari Zuniga -
and middle linebacker Jarrad Davis, who led his team in tackles and tackles for
loss despite playing on a bad ankle.

"He's the heart and soul of this team," McElwain said of Davis.

There's a lot of heart and soul going around on that D. It's the only thing
standing between the Gators and disaster.

All I know is that Saturday, Florida beat Georgia, and McElwain is 2-0 against
the Bulldogs, and Georgia's Kirby Smart is 4-4 in his first season as head coach
in Athens.

You can only beat whom you play that day.

There is danger down the road. Trouble everywhere. Surely Florida will be
exposed.

Florida beat Georgia.

We double checked.

Winter's triple post stands test of time

BYLINE: David DuPree

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 4C

LENGTH: 516 words


Chicago Bulls assistant Tex Winter, 71, has coached on the Division I college or
pro level for 47 seasons, longest tenure of any active coach at either level. He
is architect of the Bulls' famous triple-post offense.

Talk about the triple-post offense.

I've used this offense for 19 years, first at Kansas State, and it's evolved
over the years. I wrote the book Triple Post Offense in 1961. That's the bible.
It's basically everything we do. It's all spelled out there. We call it the
sideline triangle here, but others still call it the triple post. It's the same
thing.
Was it easy to sell coach Phil Jackson on this system?

Phil had been an assistant coach with me for two years before he became head
coach, and he was my assistant in the L.A. Summer League, and he liked the
offense. He said it reminded him of the old New York Knicks' offense - the
five-man concept, movement of the ball and spacing. You don't call plays every
time down the floor, you let the defense dictate the play.
Are you running it just like you did when Michael Jordan played?

Yes. The offense is predicated on ball movement and player movement with a
purpose. The guy who has the good scoring opportunity takes the shot. With
Michael we had to make some adjustments, though, giving him more of an isolation
opportunity.
It seems a lot of teams have tried to copy the offense.

They try to run it, but they never will run it like we do. Cotton Fitzsimmons
was my assistant coach at Kansas State, and he installed a lot of the
triple-post philosophy when he went to the NBA. He said he had worked with me
and understood the offense. My comment was that I may have taught him everything
he knows about the offense, but I didn't teach him everything I know.
Is it a difficult system for players to learn?

We indoctrinate the players into this system through drills. We break down the
offense into two-man, three-man and four-man situations, and our shooting comes
off these drills. It's hard for some players because they aren't used to playing
this way. They aren't used to countering the defense. They're used to calling
numbers and running a play for somebody. What does it say about the game that
you can come up with something 40 years ago and it's still effective today?

The key thing is that it's the execution of basic, fundamental skills, and
fundamentally, it's very sound. All you need is good execution. I don't think
the game has changed that much. The sound principles of the game are the same -
spacing on the floor; creating operating room for your teammates; go away from
pressure; hit your first teammate who is open.  In our offense, the person with
the ball is in position to hit any one of his teammates, and the defense
dictates which one. Is intelligence a key factor at this level, or is it all
physical skills?

There's no question intelligence helps. Some of the problems a lot of these
young players have is that they don't really understand the total concept of
basketball. It's hard for them to grasp anything but their role. You can teach
it by repetition, though.

BYU football notes: Cougar offense rolling after a slow start

BYLINE: By Jay Drew The Salt Lake Tribune

SECTION: SPORTS; College Sports; BYU Cougars

LENGTH: 536 words


Provo   That BYU offense that sputtered against Virginia in the opener suddenly
is one of the better offenses in the country, at least according to the latest
NCAA statistics.

The Cougars are No. 14 in the country in total offense, averaging 503.0 yards
per game, and No. 14 in rushing offense at 263 ypg. They are 61st in passing
offense at 240 ypg.

Quarterback Taysom Hill is No. 8 in the country in total offense -- 350.3 yards
per game.

"The players and Taysom know what is happening," BYU coach Bronco Mendenhall
said Monday in his weekly media briefing. "They are getting better and better
and better. That doesn't mean we are perfect. But man, when you are scoring as
many points as we did [against Houston] and moving the ball, they are optimistic
and hopeful."

Hague's big play

Houston missed a 45-yard field goal two plays later so it really didn't matter
as much as it seemed to at the time, but BYU defensive back Mike Hague swears
that the red-clad Cougars should not have even gotten the opportunity to score
on their first possession of the second half.

On second-and-10 from the BYU 25, John O'Korn's lateral hit the ground and
bounced into Hague's hands. But officials ruled Hague was out of bounds when he
gained possession, and the call on the field stood after a lengthy review of the
replay.

"I watched it on film and then I watched it on ESPN when I got home," Hague
said. "There's not a doubt in my mind that I had possession inbounds. And they
zoomed in on it, and I didn't bobble the ball. The ESPN guys were saying that it
was a huge momentum-changer, and BYU is going to take over on possession. And it
was backwards. I was inbounds, didn't bobble it. Should have been our ball. 100
percent."

Another new QB

BYU held Boise State quarterback Joe Southwick to just 145 yards passing on 25
attempts last year. But Southwick broke his ankle last week, and Grant Hedrick
came in to lead the Broncos to a win over Nevada. Mendenhall said Hedrick
presents challenges that Southwick did not, mainly due to the redshirt junior's
ability to run with the football.

"We saw their other quarterback come in," Mendenhall said. "Man, every team has
good players. So the other quarterback came in and ended up having a really
successful game, not only running it, but throwing it. Something like 18 out of
21 for a lot of yards. So Boise has a good team," Mendenhall said.

Wants to play Wake

In discussing his friendship with Boise State coach Chris Petersen on Monday,
Mendenhall said Petersen is one of a handful of coaches that "I have kind of
become close with" during annual functions sponsored by Nike. He said the group
also includes Oregon State coach Mike Riley and Wake Forest coach Jim Grobe.

Has BYU ever tried to schedule Wake Forest?

"Yeah, we actually have," Mendenhall said. "Can't give you an update on it, but
that would be good."

Briefly

Receiver Cody Hoffman owns the BYU career receptions record with 228 and is tied
with Austin Collie for most TD catches with 30. He needs 71 yards to pass Collie
for most receiving yards in school history, and one more 100-yard receiving game
to catch Collie in that category.

Senator drafting legislation to treat sex offenders with drug

BYLINE: Rebekah Scott, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette

SECTION: METRO; Pg. EZ-7

LENGTH: 297 words


Child molesters convicted in Pennsylvania courts may face "chemical castration"
treatments under legislation being drafted by Westmoreland Republican Sen. Bob
Regola.

The freshman state senator said last week he is writing legislation that will
treat certain sex offenders with Depo-Provera, a weekly injection that inhibits
production of sex hormones.

"This legislation will require that, for some offenses, judges order [convicts]
to undergo medically safe treatments to reduce sex drive, sexual fantasies, or
both," Sen. Regola, R-Hempfield, said.

The treatment would be mandatory for certain first offenses and discretionary
for other crimes on second or subsequent offense, he said. The legislation also
sets penalties for those who fail to comply with the court-ordered treatment.

"Chemical treatment of sex offenders is an accepted and useful tool in the
effort to protect our children from sexual predators," Sen. Regola said. "A
number of other states currently have such laws on the books, and I thought it's
about time we did something here."

In 1996 California became the first state to pass a chemical castration law.
Florida, Georgia, Louisiana and Montana have since passed similar measures;
proposals in Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, Hawaii, Michigan, Mississippi and
Missouri were never enacted or lost challenges to their constitutional
integrity.

Sen. Regola said he's rounding up legislative support for the bill and will
likely introduce it in January.

Research says the chemical works for certain types of pedophiles, but it's not a
cure-all for the disorder, said Dr. Fred Berlin, of Johns Hopkins Medical
Institutions.

"The notion we can give someone a shot, once a week, and walk away from them and
feel comfortable, I think is a very naive point of view," Berlin said.

Cowboys not just passing fancy

BYLINE: By Tom Kensler, Denver Post Sports Writer

LARAMIE - Move over, BYU.

Wyoming's football team has become the passing leader of the Western Athletic
Conference.

The 6-0 and 24th-ranked Cowboys feature the nation's individual leader in total
offense, quarterback Josh Wallwork, and the NCAA's second-rated Division I-A
receiver, Marcus Harris. Wyoming leads the WAC and ranks second nationally in
passing offense, with an average of 376 yards that trails only Idaho's 393.4.
San Diego State ranks fifth (353.3) nationally; Brigham Young is sixth (349.7).

"Wyoming reminds me of some of those great BYU teams, the way they're throwing
the ball," Nevada-Las Vegas coach Jeff Horton said.

Wallwork, averaging 378.7 yards, said he sure wouldn't want to be a defensive
coordinator in charge of devising a scheme to stop the Cowboys. Wallwork,
running back Len Sexton, tight end Greg Kuhn and wide receivers Harris, David
Saraf and Richard Peace are savvy seniors.

"There's going to be times when we have to punt, but most of the time we can
find the open areas of a defense," Wallwork said. "You can't play us man-to-man,
because we've got too many weapons. If they play zone, these guys will just find
open areas in zones. Obviously, they're trying to cover their zones, but when
you've got little shifty guys against linebackers, they don't know where the
receivers are. But I know where they are.

"It's just fun to execute this offense. It really works."

Wallwork, a 6-foot-4, 202-pound senior, has thrown 17 touchdown passes against
six interceptions. Three of those interceptions came in last week's 45-22
victory over San Jose State, when the outcome was no longer in doubt and
Wallwork got sloppy. He did not throw an interception the three previous weeks
against Hawaii, Air Force and UNLV.

Wyoming gets a break from WAC play tomorrow, hosting Western Michigan of the
Mid-American Conference. The Broncos are 0-6. Kickoff is 1 p.m. in War Memorial
Stadium.

Cowboys coach Joe Tiller isn't surprised at Wallwork's numbers. The one-back
offense never sends out fewer than three receivers and often has four or five in
pass patterns.

"I tell all the quarterbacks that in our offense the quarterback gets more
credit when things are going well, and he probably catches more hell than he
deserves when things are going bad," Tiller said. "But, quite frankly, in a
one-back, spread offense a lot of times where the ball goes and what happens to
the football is not determined until after the ball is snapped. When your
offense is functioning well, your quarterback certainly puts up impressive
numbers. Josh is executing the offense."

Wallwork said it's not all about X's and O's. Somebody has to execute the
offense. This veteran unit, which also features seniors Steve Scifres (right
tackle) and Rob Rathbun (center) on the front line, really enjoys the offense,
Wallwork said.

It shows.

"Our No. 1 goal for 1996 was to have fun," Wallwork said. "When we go out there
and don't do well, we don't have fun. When we do well, we have fun. It's just
kind of an aura about us.

"We don't have all that much more talent than anybody else, but we just seem to
be good at it. Whenever we're not on the field, we're just antsy to get back out
there. We want to be on the field. We want to be in control of the game. We just
try to move the chains, control the ball and score points. That's our job.
That's fun."

Winter, a Guru of Offense, Ends Wait to Join the Hall

BYLINE: By JONATHAN ABRAMS

Tex Winter, an innovator of the triangle offense; Chris Mullin, who led St.
John's to the Final Four in 1985; and Dennis Rodman, a colorful player known for
his rebounding, were selected for the Basketball Hall of Fame on Monday.

The announcement came at the Final Four in Houston.

The 10 members of the class of 2011 also include Tara VanDerveer, the women's
coach at Stanford; Herb Magee, the men's coach at Philadelphia University; the
former European star Arvydas Sabonis; the former A.B.A. and N.B.A. player Artis
Gilmore; the former Boston Celtics player Tom Sanders, who was known as Satch;
the Olympic medalist Teresa Edwards; and the Harlem Globetrotter Reece Tatum,
who was known as Goose.

The selection of Winter, 89, is considered long overdue. He helped tweak the
offense of Sam Barry, his coach at Southern California. Known as the triangle
offense, it has benefited from gifted players like Michael Jordan and Kobe
Bryant. Coach Phil Jackson is attempting to win a 12th N.B.A. title while
primarily using the offense, which is based on spacing and cutting.

Mullin played for the Golden State Warriors and the Indiana Pacers. He helped
establish the Big East as a top conference and was part of the original Olympic
Dream Team in 1992.

Rodman will join his former Chicago Bulls teammates Jordan and Scottie Pippen in
the Hall. Rodman started his N.B.A. career with the Detroit Pistons before
reinventing himself, being known as much for his erratic behavior, tattoos,
changing hair colors and body piercings as for his rebounding and other on-court
achievements. He was named to the league's all-defensive first team seven times
and collected five championships.

The induction ceremony is in Springfield, Mass., in August.

This year's selection process became controversial when noteworthy candidates
like Reggie Miller, who held the N.B.A. record for most 3-pointers until it was
broken by Ray Allen this season, and Don Nelson, who last year set the record
for N.B.A. career coaching victories, failed to make the cut.

Jerry Colangelo, the chairman of the Hall, defended voting members' anonymity to
prevent politicking. He added that he would strive for transparency.

BOBCATS' JACKSON TO SIT OUT Stephen Jackson, Charlotte's leading scorer, said he
would miss Tuesday's game at Cleveland -- his third straight -- with continued
pain in his left hamstring. The absence of Jackson has been a blow for the
Bobcats' postseason hopes. Charlotte remains two games behind Indiana for the
last playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. (AP)

SUPER BOWL XXV;
Giants Say Players, Not Tactics, Win Games

BYLINE: By FRANK LITSKY, Special to The New York Times

SECTION: Section B; Page 11; Column 5; Sports Desk

LENGTH: 742 words

DATELINE: TAMPA, Fla., Jan. 23


Six and a half weeks ago, when the Buffalo Bills beat the Giants, 17-13, during
the regular season, they scored their touchdowns with a no-huddle offense. Now
that hurry-up attack is a major concern for the Giants as they prepare to play
the Bills here Sunday in Super Bowl XXV.

In the first game, the confusion caused by the no-huddle attack resulted in two
big plays. Each led to a touchdown.

On the first play, Jim Kelly and Thurman Thomas teamed for a 48-yard gain on a
pass when Perry Williams of the Giants let Thomas get by him. On the second
play, Kelly hit Andre Reed for a 36-yard completion when Greg Jackson of the
Giants missed a tackle.

That damage was typical of the havoc the Bills create when they run plays
without a huddle. The idea is to give the defense no time to substitute and to
create uncertainty over which defender has which assignment.

The Players, Not the Song

Coach Bill Parcells of the Giants is having his defense work against the
no-huddle offense every day this week. But he said the no-huddle should not be
overrated.

"The no-huddle is not the problem," Parcells said. "The problem is Jim Kelly and
Andre Reed and Thurman Thomas and James Lofton, the guys who run that offense.
We're familiar with it. But I'm not saying it's not going to be a problem.

"I think it's just a two-minute offense. It can be a little unsettling. But the
no-huddle isn't going to win the game. The athletes running it are what wins
games."

In the past, the Cincinnati Bengals had success with the no-huddle offense. Then
the Bills adapted it and have had success in a different way.

"It can be intimidating," said Everson Walls, the Giant cornerback. "The Bills'
no-huddle is really different from Cincinnati's because the Bills call the plays
at the line of scrimmage.

"They are a lot quicker with it, and that puts a lot of pressure on the defense.
You have to recognize the players and their formations at the same time and
adapt your defense from that in a split second."

A Need to Communicate

Bill Belichick, the Giants' defensive coordinator, said the no-huddle offense
put stress on defensive communications.

"You don't have time to recognize some things," he said. "It also puts a
creative limit on the things the offense can try to do, but their offense is not
complex anyway."

The Giants' defense hopes to play its game and not let the Bills dictate how it
will play.

"They've taken away the aggressiveness from some defenses," said Gary Reasons,
the inside linebacker. "You can't let that happen to you. If we understand the
tempo of the game, we can match up pretty well."

Carl Banks, the outside linebacker, said: "You have to have the defensive
signals called quickly. You have to get the defensive linemen down. Once they
stand up looking for a call, it's all over."

"Adjustment is a big thing," said Erik Howard, the nose tackle. "You hope you
know their tendencies. You have to be able to adjust to the players they have in
the game."

Need to Be on Same Page

Recognition and adjustment aside, the major weapon for the defense is
communication. Pepper Johnson, the inside linebacker, told how the four
linebackers (from left to right: Banks, Reasons, Johnson and Lawrence Taylor)
had to know what each one was doing.

"The guys on the left side have to communicate what they see to the guys on the
right side," Johnson said. "If you see something, you tell Lawrence or Carl.
Lawrence can't raise up and tell Carl. So he tells me, I tell Gary and he tells
Carl."

The urgency of communication extends to all parts of the defense.

"It's who's on the field, where they line up and who covers whom," said Dave
Duerson, the backup safety. "Communications is the key, and because Everson
Walls and I are new to the Giants this year, it has forced the secondary to
communicate a lot. So we can handle this."

Not the Ultimate Defense

Johnie Cooks, a backup linebacker, said verbal messages and hand signals were
fine, but not the ultimate defense.

"The no-huddle is more of a problem if you let it be one," he said. "It's only a
problem if you fret over it instead of getting into position."

Still, everyone seems to agree that it all comes down to the players involved.
Parcells said that, and when his words were relayed to Ted Marchibroda, the
Bills' offensive coordinator agreed.

"Yes," Marchibroda said, "and the Giants have the defensive players to stop it."

Running the gauntlet

NORMAN - Texas Tech defensive coordinator David Gibbs sang a familiar song this
week with the Lubbock press.What do you see when you look at the Oklahoma
offense?Gibbs: "I see Baylor. I see TCU. I see Oklahoma."Where does your game
plan start? Is it (Samaje) Perine? (Baker) Mayfield? The list goes on and
on.Gibbs: "You tell me. I'm all ears, baby. They've got a great quarterback.
Their offensive line is humongous, physical. Two big-time running backs, about
six wide receivers that we probably can't cover any of them. We'll go fight and
do the best we can. That got you all quiet, huh?"It seems every time you face a
prolific offense, you say exactly that.Gibbs: "Have I lied to you yet?"No. Gibbs
was telling it straight. The life of a Big 12 defensive coordinator is cursed.
Like a marshal in Tombstone or a wheat farmer in Frederick, your work is never
done. Sleep at your own risk.Mike Stoops knows that well. His Sooner defense
starts a gauntlet Saturday at Owen Field. Texas Tech is in town, and the Red
Raiders throw the ball around like the old days of Mike Leach. Soon enough, OU
will face Baylor and TCU. The only redeeming news for the Sooner

defense is that it doesn't have to face the Sooner offense.But for OU to make
the Bedlam season finale meaningful for more than pride, Stoops' troops must
withstand the aerial assault.OU cornerback Zack Sanchez likened it to guarding
LeBron or Kevin Durant. You don't stop them. You only hope to contain them.
"These offenses are made to move the ball, so&nbsp;it's going to happen,"
Sanchez said.Made to move the ball. That's as good a description as any for Big
12 offenses. Baylor, TCU and Texas Tech rank 1-2-3 in NCAA scoring offense. They
rank 1-3-2 in total offense. They rank 6-5-2 in passing offense. Tech is
averaging 426.9 yards passing and 49.4 points per game.Which means OU's
defensive backs are on alert. For two straight games, the Sooners played
old-school offenses. Tight ends. Power running. Option. Kansas State didn't
throw much. Texas quarterback Jerrod Heard would have pickled the pigskin before
he would throw it.Now it's back to the fiery furnace for the OU defense. Even
upcoming foes Kansas and Iowa State run the Air Raid or a not-so-distant cousin.
Mandatory overtime for Sanchez and his buddies."In this league, to have success
you gotta have people match up week in and week out," Stoops said. "That's
important. Our cover guys have covered better. A lot of our success is based on
that, challenging throws and routes. The more cover guys you have, the better
your chances will be to survive in this league."The Sooner pass defense flunked
the exhibition season. Tulsa torched OU back on Sept. 19. Golden Hurricane
quarterback Dane Evans threw for 427 yards, and TU played the Sooners tough
before losing 52-38.But OU played that game without sophomore Jordan Thomas, who
is showing signs of surpassing Sanchez as an elite cornerback, and OU has since
moved Will Johnson into the lineup in place of oft-burned Hatari Byrd."It's
getting better," Bob Stoops said of the pass coverage. "They're talented guys.
They have experience on the field.0 â?¦ They're playing in a good way. We have
to keep it going, especially this week."Get it going, is more like it. Slowing
Texas and K-State isn't akin to slowing Tech or Baylor or TCU. Slow the Big 12
wizards, and the Sooners can reach championship contention. Don't slow the Big
12 wizards, and the last half of the 2015 season won't be pretty.I haven't lied

Massachusetts officials say animal cruelty a major problem

BYLINE: By Paula Owen Telegram & Gazette

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 1215 words


WORCESTER (AP) &GT;&GT; The link between animal abuse and other violent crimes
is well-documented, and law enforcement agencies and courts are recognizing that
people who commit serious acts of animal abuse frequently have past criminal
histories or are more apt to commit violent crimes against humans.

Beginning January 2016, the U.S. Department of Justice Federal Bureau of
Investigation will collect data on animal cruelty offenses as separate offenses
in the National Incident Based Reporting System. Up until now, data on animal
cruelty offenses was collected under "all other offenses."

The National Sheriff's Association and the Animal Welfare Institute submitted
proposals to the agency's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program to add animal
cruelty as a separate offense in the system, according to the FBI.

Animal cruelty will be added as a Group A offense under "Crime against Society."
The offense will include four types of animal abuse: simple/gross neglect,
intentional abuse and torture, organized abuse (dogfighting and cockfighting)
and animal sexual abuse.

The FBI defines animal cruelty as "intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly
taking an action that mistreats or kills any animal without just cause, such as
torturing, tormenting, mutilation, maiming, poisoning, or abandonment." Animal
neglect is also included. However, the definition does not include proper
maintenance of animals for show or sport; use of animals for food, lawful
hunting, fishing or trapping, the FBI said.

Worcester County Sheriff Lewis G. Evangelidis said he agrees with tracking the
data.

"With a specific designation we can better track the extent, breadth and who the
people are committing them," he said. "It is a sick sort of behavior that we
should be tracking. There is a clear link between violence against people that
often starts with violence against animals."

He said the tracking will allow law enforcement agencies to evaluate such crimes
better, and allocate resources.

Criminologist Alfred Blumstein, of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh,
said there is little question that the UCR is the dominant source of information
about crime, both nationally and locally. Police departments pay attention to it
because information included in it is coming from them, he said.

"There are other sources, but the most widespread is the UCR, and we would all
like to see richer information about the crime incidents, and the FBI and the
Bureau of Justice Statistics of the Department of Justice are making efforts to
strengthen that," he said.

Richard P. LeBlond, chief of the law enforcement division of the Massachusetts
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, said animal cruelty is a major
problem in Worcester County and throughout the state. Tracking the data is a
step in the right direction, he said, and it will help judges taking it a lot
more seriously.

The MSPCA responds to 3,000 complaints a year, Mr. LeBlond said. In the past
three years, charges have been brought against 50 defendants in district courts
in the state.

"We always talk about the correlation between animal abuse and crimes against
people, and now we'll have the numbers to actually show it," he said. "It is
going to show animal cruelty is a major issue. There are a lot of good police
departments investigating and bringing up charges. With the new tracking, other
departments will realize it's a problem. I have eight officers on the street in
my department for the entire state. If half the police departments take an
interest in animal cruelty, I would have that many more people out there working
for animals."

Additionally, Worcester District Attorney's Office spokesman Timothy J. Connolly
said the DA's office plans to designate an assistant district attorney and
victim advocate with sensitivity toward animals to handle animal cruelty cases
in Worcester County. That ADA will have experience prosecuting the cases, he
said.

"We want to make sure these cases are prosecuted with some sensitivity," he
said. "We'll have one person who follows the cases and breaks out to do the
cases in other district courts as they come up."

Karen M. Riley-McNary, director of community intervention for the YWCA in
Leominster, said her agency sees the same rates of children as victims as they
do violence toward animals. Tracking the data may help further confirm the link
between animal cruelty and domestic violence, she said.

"Victims are scared to leave because their pets are at risk if they are not with
them," she said. "They tell them, 'I will kill the cat, the dog, the horse, the
snake .' It could also be neglect and they say they will just open the door and
let them out."

She said having police departments better track animal cruelty cases may
motivate officers to investigate further.

"I think it is a wonderful entry point for someone not seeking support or
assistance for themselves," she said. "If a neighbor calls who witnessed
egregious animal cruelty and police investigate, they could find a similar
situation inside the home. I'm willing to wager, anyone that is abusing an
animal is abusing others in some form or fashion."

Strangulation, for instance, is frequently practiced on pets, she said, dogs
specifically, for the abuser to see how far they can go.

"They want to see how much force it would take to render the dog unconscious
versus death," she said. "There is also a level of fear with the threat, 'If you
leave me, I will kill the pet.' It is a common form of abuse to abuse the pet as
a means of emotionally abusing the survivor."

Phil S. Arkow is the coordinator for the National Link Coalition, an
organization headquartered in New Jersey that tracks data links between animal
cruelty and other crimes. He said 70 percent of animal abusers have criminal
records.

"Animal abusers are three-and-a-half more times likely to commit other crimes
than non-abusers in Massachusetts," he said. "The traditional thinking is people
who abuse animals need to get bigger and bigger thrills and move on to crimes
against people. Animal abuse doesn't always lead to committing other crimes, but
it often does. We shouldn't be surprised when we find a link, but it is easy to
say animal abusers go on to become mass murderers and serial killers. That's an
oversimplification. But they could, and sometimes they do."

"Tracking the data is one of the most important changes in humane law
enforcement that we've ever seen," he added. "When we're trying to get
legislators on the state or local level or the general public to understand the
importance of animal cruelty, we need to have numbers to show them. We've been
doing humane law enforcement for 150 years, but we haven't had any statistics on
the state, local or national levels to document the extent of these crimes.

"The second benefit is that in many communities around the country, there are
not SPCAs or Humane Societies with authority to investigate animal cruelty," he
said. "And so it usually falls to police or sheriffs to investigate these
crimes. Unfortunately, human nature is such that if something is out of sight,
it's out of mind. If the crime doesn't show up on their checklist, they don't
see it as a priority. This new procedure will change all that."

Troy grows up

BYLINE: TOMMY DAHLK, LINCOLN JOURNAL STAR

SECTION: D; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 621 words

DATELINE: LINCOLN, NE


Trojans have made great strides since their first trip to Lincoln

Last September, Troy got blown out in nonconference games at Missouri and South
Carolina.

That hasn't been the case for the Trojans this season.

In early road games against Florida State and Georgia Tech, a  new spread
offense kept the Trojans in both games until late in the fourth quarter. In
fact, against the Seminoles, Troy had the lead with six minutes left before
costly   turnovers enabled Florida State to pull out a 24-17 victory.

Troy coach Larry Blakeney said he's pleased with his team's progress this year.

"We've had some good moments and some bad moments," Blakeney said. "The kids are
confident that they can move the ball. We've been able to get some yards, move
the chains and score some points. Basically, we've hurt ourselves like a lot of
teams do late with turnovers and trying to force it a little bit. But I like
what I'm seeing, and we've been practicing well."

In just the sixth season since making the jump from Division I-AAto I-A, Troy
seems to have found its niche on college football's top level.

But what has caused this sudden metamorphosis from pretender to near contender?

Well, offensive coordinator Tony Franklin can take some credit.

Last season, the Trojans ran a mostly run-oriented offense. They ranked 111th in
the nation in total offense, averaging only 283 yards per contest.

In order to compete on this level, Blakeney knew he'd have to be able to put
more points on the board. So he hired the highly regarded Franklin. While
serving as Kentucky's offensive coordinator in 2000, Franklin's offense was 11th
in the nation in total offense and second in passing.

Franklin has brought his spread offense to Troy, and after three games, the
Trojans are averaging 338.7 yards against stiff competition.

Junior wide receiver Gary Banks said the players have had an easy transition
into the spread offense.

"Coach Franklin's system wasn't too hard to adjust into," Banks said. "It wasn't
anything too difficult. He made it as simple as possible and catered to our
needs."

The new offense is more fast-paced, running out of the no-huddle often. Plus,
instead of running the ball 30 to 40 times a game like the Trojans did last
year, they are primarily passing. Against Florida State, junior quarterback Omar
Haugabook attempted 39 passes, a school record.

Banks and the other wide receivers have enjoyed the change.  Already this
season, Banks has 23 catches for 246 yards. He caught 25 passes all of last
year.

In 2004, Banks came to Troy as a quarterback after spending three seasons
playing baseball in the Chicago Cubs' organization. During fall camp, Banks
moved to wide receiver.

Banks said a lot has changed since he arrived.

"Just the atmosphere here that is going on around campus is different," Banks
said. "The way Chancellor Dr. Jack Hawkins has been conducting business shows
there's a positive uprising in Troy, not only in athletics."

Blakeney agrees, and thinks his program has changed a lot in the past couple of
seasons.

"I've got to think we've made some improvements," Blakeney said. "We've enhanced
our facilities and we're improving at a steady rate. I think we've improved our
caliber of players that we can bring in here. Everything is about players and
being able to recruit good student-athletes."

Now, all Troy needs is one major upset to get on the map. Banks said he hopes
Troy can pull it off against Nebraska.

"Idon't think any of us are nervous going into Nebraska because we've played at
Florida State and Georgia Tech," he said. "When you're a school like Troy, you
have to play these types of teams to put yourself out there. This year, we've
been maybe just one or two plays away from pulling off a big upset."

Big Ten gets points without getting dirty

BYLINE: By AL LESAR; Tribune Staff Writer

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. C2

LENGTH: 513 words


Three yards and a cloud of dust is an outdated way to look at offenses in the
Big Ten.

And not just because so many football stadiums have dust-restricting artificial
surfaces.

Big-time gunslingers, experienced quarterbacks who spread the field and let it
fly, have turned the once conservative Big Ten into one of the country's most
explosive leagues.

Big Ten teams average 31.8 points a game, ranking second in the nation behind
the Pac-10's 34.5. Why the big numbers? Why the explosive attacks?

"It all starts with the veteran quarterbacks that are playing in the league,"
Michigan coach Lloyd Carr said during Tuesday's Big Ten coaches teleconference.
"There are a lot of them and they're all having great years."

Guys like Northwestern's Brett Basanez, Drew Stanton of Michigan State, Iowa's
Drew Tate, John Stocco of Wisconsin, Michael Robinson of Penn State and
Michigan's Chad Henne are all perfect examples of the seasoned chuckers.

"They have great mobility and have the ability to make plays with their legs,"
Carr said. "That allows them to stretch a defense. With the spread offense, it
gives the quarterback an opportunity to get the ball to a great athlete
(receiver) in space."

"Football has evolved," Ohio State coach Jim Tressel said. "Television
de-regulated college football games in the early '80s. These kids grew up
watching games from all over the country. They were inundated with football.

"High school coaches have been able to do so much better teaching with the help
of film and other aids. Then there's the physical part, the speed, strength and
improvements in training. This is a very skillful time for football.

"The offensive product has been helped so much. Spread offenses have changed the
game and have opened things up."

"Offense is never as good or as bad as you think," Northwestern coach Randy
Walker said. "What intrigues me about the spread offense is that it gives the
quarterback the opportunity to make plays. There are all kinds of ways to skin a
cat, but we like it in the quarterback's hands."

With Basanez in his fourth year as a starter, the Wildcats rank 16th in the
country with 37.1 points a game en route to a 5-2 record (3-1 Big Ten).

"Since 1976, any offense I've ever been part of comes down to execution," Walker
said. "Every play is drawn up to score a touchdown if everyone executes, right?
If the quarterback makes a good decision and everyone executes, it all works.

"I think coaches have finally figured out that the field is 53 yards wide.
They've gone to spreading things out to see what happens."

What's happened has been an onslaught of points and some wide open shootouts.

"A guy like Basanez runs that offense like it's his own," Michigan State coach
John L. Smith said of the guy who demolished the Spartans last week.

"The multiple offenses you see in the league make preparation hard," Wisconsin
coach Barry Alvarez said. "You've got so many veteran quarterbacks who know how
to make an offense work. Every week, they just keep coming at you."

Without raising a bit of dust.

ON PRO FOOTBALL;
Tired of Losing, Defense Angrily Points Fingers

BYLINE: By Mike Freeman

SECTION: Section D; Page 1; Column 1; Sports Desk

LENGTH: 911 words

DATELINE: LANDOVER, Md.


This is becoming the same old sad, miserable story for the Giants. It keeps
repeating itself, like a bad dream, or Bill Murray's tripping out in "Groundhog
Day." The Giants' offense is so bad, it was practically shut down by the worst
defense in the National Football League. The Giants' offense is so bad that
quarterback Kent Graham was on the sideline late in the second quarter, taking
smelling salts, his head woozy from yet another concussion after enduring a
half-dozen nasty shots from the Washington Redskins' terrible defensive line.

This situation has become so frustrating that defensive players, for the first
time all season, openly ripped into their offensive counterparts after the
Giants' miserable 23-13 loss yesterday. Nothing and no one was spared. This is
quickly becoming a dangerous situation for the team.

"Something needs to be done because this is just crazy," said linebacker Jessie
Armstead, in a moment alone, expressing the most frustration he ever has in his
seven-year professional career. "The guys on offense need to fight as hard as we
do. It just makes you crazy."

"I don't know what is going on over there," he said of the offense. "As far as
the coaching or who brings in the players, maybe the administration needs to do
something. I don't know if it's the players or the coaches or what. I don't
know."

When asked if he was sure he wanted to say these things publicly, Armstead
kicked his acerbic but true words into another gear: "Look, all I can tell you
is that any time you hold an offense to 13 points, one of the best offenses in
the league, what more do you want?" (Actually, 16 Redskin points came from their
offense. One touchdown resulted from a run with a fumble.)

He continued: "I don't care how many yards they had on the ground. Stats are for
losers. Points win games. Not stats. And there have been too many times when our
defense is out there, for too long, and what do you want from us?"

Armstead later suggested that he would play quarterback in addition to
linebacker if it would help.

His frustration was echoed by a number of defensive players. It is
understandable. After watching weeks of an offense that does not know how to
win, that constantly makes mistakes and always relies on the defense to bail the
team out of trouble, Giants defenders would not be human if they didn't express
frustration and anger as they did after the game.

Defensive end Michael Strahan said that the Giants "always find a way to lose
instead of a way to win."

He added, "I don't know if it's because we don't believe in ourselves or what."

When asked if he really meant the offense instead of the entire team, Strahan
said, "What do you think?"

Another defensive player, who asked not to be identified, said: "I would love to
go against our offense. No one respects our offense. Not a team in the league
does, and I don't blame them."

Other defensive players pinpointed specific offensive players and added that
Coach Jim Fassel should make wholesale changes if needed.

Running back Tiki Barber was asked if he could sense the frustration of the
defensive players. "I don't sense it," he said. "But if I was them, I would be.
They held them to 13 points. We gave up a touchdown. That should be enough to
win. The dropped passes, the fumble at the end of the game, the small things are
killing us."

For a game of such magnitude, the Giants' offense seemed so uninspired and
unimaginative. A New York victory meant taking control of the National Football
Conference East. There was another element. Washington blew out the Giants
earlier in the season, 50-21. The Giants talked about how embarrassing that was.
They would get revenge. The Redskins would pay.

Instead the offense missed the memo that said there was pride at stake in this
game. Only the defense got the message, again carrying the Giants, playing
arrogant, bold football.

One series typified the spunk of the defense and the timidity of the offense.
Giants safety Percy Ellsworth intercepted a Brad Johnson pass intended for
Albert Connell. Toward the end of Ellsworth's 26-yard return, the 300-pound
Giants defensive tackle Keith Hamilton launched his entire body into fullback
Mike Sellers, who was trying to make the tackle on Ellsworth. As the hit
unfolded, Sellers's body crumpled the way a piece of paper does. It was the kind
of inspiring, and frankly violent, block that should have inspired the offense.
It did the defense, which jumped up and down in celebration.

"I wanted to knock his head off," Hamilton said, "because I thought that might
maybe inspire not just the defense, but the offense as well."

It was a nice try. After that play, the Giants' offense moved the ball just 4
yards on 4 plays and settled for a 44-yard field goal.

Before being knocked out of the game only minutes before the end of the first
half, Graham had just three completions, which equaled the number of times he
was sacked. On their first four possessions, the Giants punted twice and Graham
was intercepted twice. Running back LeShon Johnson missed a block that led to
Graham's getting hit hard and landing directly on his head the first of three
times. Wide receiver Joe Jurevicius dropped a pass that hit him square in the
chest.

On the sideline, Giants defensive players, bunched together, just shook their
heads. They had seen this before. Only this time, they had seen too much of it,
and they weren't going to remain quiet.

VIKINGS MUST TACKLE BEAR OF AN OFFENSE

BYLINE: GREG JOHNSON, Staff Writer

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 1D

LENGTH: 993 words


It has been called basketball on grass.

The Chicago Bears' offense under first-year coordinator Gary Crowton is a
mixture of formations, screen passes and other quick-hitting plays. It's part
run-and-shoot and part smashmouth football.

It's also a challenge for NFL defensive coordinators, because no other team puts
together a scheme the way the Bears run their offense.

It can be headache to prepare for, but it makes for an interesting week for
defensive players preparing for a game like no other.

"Their style is to use personnel groupings to keep you off balance and to keep
you back on your heels so you can't be aggressive," Vikings defensive
coordinator Foge Fazio said. "When they do spread you out, the ball comes out
very quick. They run a lot of quick screens, and the whole line pulls out. It's
a lot like Notre Dame used to do when they had 'the Rocket' (Raghib Ismail)
there. We call it the 'Jailbreak screen.' They change it up, and they are very
creative with it."

One time the Bears might line up with four wide receivers, and the next down
they might have three tight ends. It depends on the game plan of Crowton, who
came to the NFL after being the head coach at Louisiana Tech the past three
seasons.

Last season, his offense averaged 542 yards passing, and wide receiver Troy
Edwards, the first-round draft pick of the Pittsburgh Steelers, caught 140
passes for 1,996 yards and 27 touchdowns.

Edwards had 21 receptions for 405 yards and three TDs against Nebraska.

As with any innovative idea, Crowton's offense has received mixed reviews
throughout the league. Some have dismissed it as a college offense, while others
are complimentary.

After Chicago's opening 20-17 victory over Kansas City, Chiefs coach Gunther
Cunningham said, "They play razzle-dazzle football. But after you get used to
it, once you see it on film, once a game is played, you know what they are all
about. It's not confusing."

Crowton inherited an offense that hasn't had a Pro Bowl player since 1992, when
running back Neal Anderson and center Jay Hilgenberg made the trip to Honolulu.

Crowton was hired by new Bears coach Dick Jauron. Crowton was the quarterbacks
coach at Boston College under Tom Coughlin, now the head coach of the
Jacksonville Jaguars. Jauron was Coughlin's defensive coordinator in
Jacksonville the past four years before leaving for the Bears.

"I've never claimed to be the most innovative man in the world, or any of that,"
Crowton said last week before the Bears played the New Orleans Saints. "I'm just
running football plays. I'm just trying to use the people we have and move the
football."

The Bears rank 15th in total offense with an average of 313.8 yards, and 10th in
passing with 228.3 yards.

Last Sunday, the Bears struggled until quarterback Shane Matthews threw two
touchdown passes to Curtis Conway in the final 1:48 to pull out a 14-13 victory.

"We didn't do a lot off our spread-out offense this past week because of the
weather and the blitzing style that New Orleans played," said Matthews, who has
passed for 859 yards and six TDs with three interceptions. "I think we're all
young in this offense, and we're still learning. We've only played four games,
and as the season goes on we're going to get better."

Matthews, who has been waived four times by the Bears, loves to be in control of
the offense.

"It's very similar to what I ran at the University of Florida under Steve
Spurrier," he said. "It gives the quarterback a lot of freedom, plus a lot of
responsibility is put on the quarterback's shoulders to get in the right
protections and call the right plays or whatever. I'm enjoying doing it. It's
basically what I did all in college. I think that's why I've had the chance to
be the starter."

Fazio said the Vikings can't be out of position against this kind of attack.

"You can't chase ghosts," he said. "You have to prepare to line up and know your
rules and communicate to one another, come off the ball and make the play. They
have a nice scheme on how they do things. I'm sure as (Crowton) gets his schemes
working, they will be even more hellacious. They have good athletes out there,
and that's what they are trying to do is spread you out and get the ball to
Conway and (Bobby) Engram. They like to spread you out so Curtis Enis has more
running room. I think those guys are starting to believe in that system."

Free safety Orlando Thomas said the week of preparation has the defense ready
for this week's challenge.

"They're going to throw a lot of formations that we've seen earlier this year,"
Thomas said. "There were different teams that gave us different looks, or
whatever, and they basically do the same thing. So, we've had opportunities to
see some of it. They run some things different."

The Vikings recorded three sacks in Sunday's 21-14 victory over the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers. It might be hard to duplicate this week because of the way the Bears
operate.

"We've got to get a decent pass rush," Vikings defensive line coach Andre
Patterson said. "They get the ball off quick, so I don't envision it being a
huge sack day for us. But we still want to get some pressure and hit the
quarterback. Hopefully, we can get some tipped balls and try to work on that. We
did a good job of that last week. We need to carry that over into this week.
Even when they get in the shotgun, they get it out quick. (Matthews) will move
around to throw, but he's not a tuck-it-and-go-with-it type of quarterback."

Vikings coach Dennis Green said he expects to see all of the Bears' repertoire
in the climate-controlled Metrodome.

"(Crowton) came out of the college game, and I think he comes in wanting to be
wide open," Green said. "The weather is going to be a little difficult late in
the year, but right now, they are wide open. And coming to play in our place,
they are going to be wide open."

Maryland's hand-held cellphone ban to get stricter

BYLINE: Teresa Ann Boeckel, York Daily Record, Pa.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 346 words


May 29--YORK, Pa -- Talking on a hand-held cellphone while driving is prohibited
in Maryland, but in the fall, a change in the law will make police enforcement
of the ban a little easier.

Currently, the hand-held cellphone ban is a secondary offense, meaning that
police have to stop the driver for another offense before a ticket can be issued
for the cell phone infraction.

But starting Oct. 1, the ban becomes a primary offense, meaning that police can
pull over a driver they see using a hand-held phone, said Buel Young, spokesman
for the Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration. No other offense is needed.

The fines for breaking the hand-held cellphone ban in Maryland will be $75 for
the first offense, $125 for the second offense and $175 for the third or
subsequent offense.

Making it a primary offense will give some teeth to the enforcement element,
Young said.

Elizabeth Shue of Springettsbury Township said she thinks it's a good idea.
Drivers are too distracted, she said, and they need to have their wits about
them.

"I wish Pennsylvania would do that," she said of the law.

Pennsylvania does not have a law for talking on hand-held cellphones. It does
have a ban on texting while driving, which is a primary offense.

Wayne Harper, director of the York County-based Center for Traffic Safety, said
his hat is off to Maryland for trying to enhance the law.

The distraction is not the cellphone, he said. The distraction is the
conversation.

Peter Jackson of Elkton, Md. said he thinks his state's ban is good for safety.

"You can't drive and talk," he said.

He had pulled off at the Pennsylvania rest stop near the state line to make a
call.

Micky McKeon-Fish of Millville, N.J. estimates that 50 percent of the drivers he
sees are on a cellphone. And about 50 percent of those drivers are clueless, he
said.

"I think it should be at least more enforced," McKeon-Fish said of the new
Maryland law.

A whole lot like basketball;
THE NEW OFFENSE;
POKES WILL BE LEARNING A WHOLE NEW WAY TO PLAY FOOTBALL

BYLINE: Brandon Chatmon

SECTION: SPORTS MONDAY; Pg. 13B

Basketball on grass.

That's what many have called Oklahoma State's new offensive attack because it is
a high-scoring, exciting philosophy.

Few people in the state outside of Stillwater understand how deep the comparison
goes better than Ty Prestidge.

The Mustang coach has been running the offense at the Class 6A school for over
five years and has spent time learning fundamentals of the new offense from the
coaching staffs at Texas Tech and Houston, including last summer when Cowboys'
new offensive coordinator Dana Holgorsen was the OC for the Cougars.

"It's a lot like kids playing basketball," Prestidge said. "You draw up plays,
but they know where to sit, (understand) spacing, sitting down in creases
against zone defenses and stuff like that. To me, it's the same thing."

Prestidge likened the offense to the 3-2 fast break drill which is commonplace
in most basketball practices. The point guard stops at the free-throw line and
reacts to how the defense is playing the two wing players. In OSU's new offense,
the quarterback is the point guard and the receivers are the wing players.

That's what makes the amount of repetitions so critical in the offense.
Basketball teams repeatedly run the 3-2 fast-break drill, even though it's never
like that in a game. The same principle applies to this offense.

"In basketball practice, you practice the fast break," Prestidge said. "But you
get in a game, it doesn't look like that all the time. Kids see where the
defense is and slide away. It's the same thing in route running in this offense.
They learn to adjust to the way people are playing."

In Holgorsen's system, the quarterback and receivers have to have enough reps
together to react in sync to what they see. It's critical for them to get
practice reps together so the quarterback can anticipate what his receivers will
do in certain situations.

"(As a receiver) you have to feel where areas are at, where the open hole is,"
Prestidge said. "And the quarterbacks have to see you do that a bunch."

When Holgorsen arrived at OSU, new descriptive words started to pop up when
Cowboys coaches and skill position players were talking about the keys to
offensive success.

Football savvy. Knack for getting open. Sitting down in holes.

Similar words describe the NBA champion Los Angeles Lakers' triangle offense, an
offense which features limited plays, instead focusing on spacing and the
ability to adapt on the fly.

Said Prestidge: "(In basketball) there are kids you can put in plays, but
they're good basketball players because they know when there are soft spots in
zone and when to slide into them. This offense is very much like that."

A whole lot like basketball;
THE NEW OFFENSE;
POKES WILL BE LEARNING A WHOLE NEW WAY TO PLAY FOOTBALL

Basketball on grass.

That's what many have called Oklahoma State's new offensive attack because it is
a high-scoring, exciting philosophy.

Few people in the state outside of Stillwater understand how deep the comparison
goes better than Ty Prestidge.

The Mustang coach has been running the offense at the Class 6A school for over
five years and has spent time learning fundamentals of the new offense from the
coaching staffs at Texas Tech and Houston, including last summer when Cowboys'
new offensive coordinator Dana Holgorsen was the OC for the Cougars.

"It's a lot like kids playing basketball," Prestidge said. "You draw up plays,
but they know where to sit, (understand) spacing, sitting down in creases
against zone defenses and stuff like that. To me, it's the same thing."

Prestidge likened the offense to the 3-2 fast break drill which is commonplace
in most basketball practices. The point guard stops at the free-throw line and
reacts to how the defense is playing the two wing players. In OSU's new offense,
the quarterback is the point guard and the receivers are the wing players.

That's what makes the amount of repetitions so critical in the offense.
Basketball teams repeatedly run the 3-2 fast-break drill, even though it's never
like that in a game. The same principle applies to this offense.

"In basketball practice, you practice the fast break," Prestidge said. "But you
get in a game, it doesn't look like that all the time. Kids see where the
defense is and slide away. It's the same thing in route running in this offense.
They learn to adjust to the way people are playing."

In Holgorsen's system, the quarterback and receivers have to have enough reps
together to react in sync to what they see. It's critical for them to get
practice reps together so the quarterback can anticipate what his receivers will
do in certain situations.

"(As a receiver) you have to feel where areas are at, where the open hole is,"
Prestidge said. "And the quarterbacks have to see you do that a bunch."

When Holgorsen arrived at OSU, new descriptive words started to pop up when
Cowboys coaches and skill position players were talking about the keys to
offensive success.

Football savvy. Knack for getting open. Sitting down in holes.

Similar words describe the NBA champion Los Angeles Lakers' triangle offense, an
offense which features limited plays, instead focusing on spacing and the
ability to adapt on the fly.

Said Prestidge: "(In basketball) there are kids you can put in plays, but
they're good basketball players because they know when there are soft spots in
zone and when to slide into them. This offense is very much like that."

SEC NOTEBOOK: Fulmer not worried about Vols' low rating

BYLINE: Mark Schlabach, Staff

LENGTH: 577 words

Birmingham --- Tennessee hasn't finished lower than second in the SEC East since
1992, but media members have selected the Vols to finish a distant third this
season.

Florida edged Georgia in voting Thursday during the SEC Media Days, with the
Gators finishing five votes better than the Bulldogs. Georgia received 45
first-place votes, two more than the Gators, but several media members picked
the Bulldogs to finish at least third, where they ended up the past two seasons.

Alabama, nearly a unanimous pick to win the SEC West, received all but four of
89 first-place votes. Mississippi received three first-place votes and finished
second, and Mississippi State was third.

The Crimson Tide, which won last year's SEC Championship Game, was picked by 61
voters to win the SEC title. Georgia was second with 11 votes, followed by
Florida (10) and Mississippi (2).

Tennessee lost 15 starters from last year's 9-3 team, including quarterback Tee
Martin, four starting offensive linemen and three of four starters in its
secondary.

But Tennessee coach Phillip Fulmer said he is excited about his team, which
might have to play several freshmen.

"I think we lost a little bit last year, from an attitude standpoint," Fulmer
said. "I think we had some kids who were more concerned about the name on the
back of their jerseys instead of the 'T' on their helmets. This team seems to be
more into each other."

The Vols were hit especially hard by players leaving school early to enter the
NFL Draft. Running back Jamal Lewis, safety Deon Grant, offensive tackle Cosey
Coleman, linebacker Raynoch Thompson and defensive end Shaun Ellis each gave up
his last year of eligibility to turn pro.

"The five (players) leaving early kind of kicked us in the teeth," Fulmer said.
"You don't blame the kids, and I certainly don't begrudge them. But those five
guys left us short-handed. We really didn't count on all of them leaving."

Preseason All-SEC

Georgia quarterback Quincy Carter and defensive tackle Richard Seymour were
chosen preseason first-team All-SEC. Carter, a junior, received the third-
highest vote total with 86, behind Alabama receiver Freddie Milons and
Vanderbilt linebacker Jamie Winborn, who had 87 each.

Five Bulldogs were named second-team All-SEC: offensive tackle Jonas Jennings,
tight end Randy McMichael, receiver Terrence Edwards, defensive tackle Marcus
Stroud and linebacker Kendrell Bell.

Alabama and Tennessee each had five players on the first team.

No second-guessing

Fulmer said he had no anxiety about signing offensive tackle Jason Respert of
Warner Robins, who was arrested in January on charges of allegedly sexually
assaulting a coed during a recruiting visit to Florida. Respert later pleaded
guilty to two misdemeanor charges and was sentenced to probation, community
service and a fine.

"The incident obviously made it a (hard decision)," Fulmer said, "but we signed
him for the same reasons we recruited him. We thought he was a good person, an
outstanding student and a heck of a football player.

"I don't try at all to minimize the incident," the coach said. "I wasn't there
to know what happened. But after it became clear, we felt it was the right thing
to do, for the same reason it was the right decision to recruit him."

Respert is one of the top candidates to play at center. Another freshman,
Michael Munoz, son of NFL Hall of Famer Anthony Munoz, will compete for a guard
spot.

TAKING OFFENSE ; N.C. STATE, WISCONSIN DEFEND THEIR STYLES

BYLINE: LENN ROBBINS

SECTION: Metro; Pg. 71

LENGTH: 502 words


SYRACUSE - College coaches, assistant coaches, high school coaches and AAU
coaches had their VCRs on last night.

Smack dab in the middle of the NCAA tournament, right there in the Sweet 16, a
coach's clinic unfolded in front of the nation. N.C. State and Wisconsin met
last night in the Carrier Dome in a game that featured two unique offenses that
more university, high school and AAU teams around the country are mimicking.

N.C. State runs what is referred to as the "Princeton" offense, developed by
former Tigers coach Pete Carril. The Princeton offense places all five players
above the foul line and uses screens and back cuts to spread the court and force
defenders to cover more ground.

"When we first started practicing with the offense we had a lot of segments of
practicing 5-on-0 because we had to learn the offense ice cold," N.C. State
forward Ilian Evtimov said. "It wasn't until a few weeks into practice that we
started practicing 5-on-5 and it was a big difference. We were just messing up
and everyone was really frustrated."

Wisconsin runs the "Swing" offense, a relative of the flex offense run by
Maryland and Gonzaga, among others. Wisconsin coach Bo Ryan tweaked the flex
when he was a Division III coach at Wisconsin-Platteville and came up with the
Swing.

It is similar to the Princeton offense in the sense it uses back screens and
cuts with the intent of getting defensive players in uncomfortable positions.
Guards will post up; forwards work from the perimeter.

"We practiced 5-on-0 and didn't score," Ryan said. "That hurt."

The offenses have a lot in common, starting with the fact they help
less-talented teams compete with more athletic ones. The Princeton and Swing
offenses read the defense and capitalize on mistakes, particularly when a
defender overplays.

"When the offense is at its best it's really just in motion," Wisconsin forward
Mike Wilkinson said. "You're just reading what the defense is doing. If they
overplay something, you counter."

Ryan bristled when was asked if he ever didn't recruit a talented player because
he didn't think he could fit the system. The mistake opponents often make is
that teams that run these offenses don't have terrific talent.

Wisconsin's Devin Harris was a first-round NBA Draft choice last season and N.C.
State's Julius Hodge is expected to be one this year. Neither team is as loaded
as North Carolina, or perhaps even last night's Tar Heels' opponent, Villanova,
but the systems maximize the talent.

"When I was first introduced to the offense I said, damn, coach tricked me,"
Hodge said.

The coaches said too much is being made of their offensive styles.

"It's not so much learning the plays but learning how to play," N.C. State coach
Herb Sendek said.

Ryan said he was relishing the matchup.

"It's fun just trying to prepare for teams that do certain things offensively
and you try to pick up tendencies and the same thing people do against us," Ryan
said. "There are a lot of similarities. Get good shots and get more of them."

                           September 12, 2008 Friday

Teams try new approaches

BYLINE: By Howard Herman, Berkshire Eagle Staff

SECTION: SPORTS; Local

LENGTH: 601 words


Football is a game of repetition and habit. So it can be a little bit unusual
for a high school team to completely eliminate what it has done on offense or
defense and try something new.

But that's exactly what is happening at three Berkshire County high schools this
fall. Monument Mountain has put away its old offense, a combination I-formation
running offense for the West Virginia University-style spread attack. It's
similar to something Taconic put in last year.

Pittsfield High School, however, has been running out of the shotgun for the
past several years and had preferred to throw the ball. This year, however, the
Generals are going to run early and often -- out of an option attack.

McCann Tech had been gradually switching its offense from a run-first attack, to
a pass-first attack.

"We have nothing to lose by going to a new offense," Monument coach Mike Huggins
said recently.

Huggins' team has been up and down over the past several years, but had come up
short in a bid for post-season play.

"The way the offense has gone the last couple of seasons, I knew it was time for
a change," he said. "When we were having trouble, it was on offense. We were
predictable. I knew when (the coaching staff) talked about it, we had nothing to
lose by doing it."

Huggins recalled that the switch to the spread offense started with an annual
trip to a high school coaching clinic in Newport, R.I., where he heard
University of Massachusetts offensive coordinator Kevin Morris -- a former
Williams College football player -- discuss zone blocking and spreading out the
offense.

"It's challenging," said Huggins of installing his new offense, "but it's fun."

Under former coach Russ Quetti, the Generals used to line up in shotgun
formation and would throw the ball around more than anyone in the county. Brian
Jezewski is the new PHS coach, and he said he thought it was time for a change.

"With the type of kid we get, it was the best offense for us," said the new
coach, referring to the option offense.

It's similar to the one Mike DeLong runs at Springfield College, where Jezewski
played, but certainly not as complicated.

"It's kind of an on-going thing," Jezewski said of his offense. "We could add
stuff and take stuff out. We do it in tiers, and we're in the middle of Tier
One."

Sophomore Mike Mancivilano returns as Pittsfield's starting quarterback, and the
first-year coach said he's comfortable with Mancivilano in the new offense.

Senior Jared DiNicola was clued into the new offense during the spring. But
Jezewski really didn't unveil things to his players until the start of the
preseason.

"(The coaches) met throughout the summer. A lot of the kids play spring and
summer sports, and I didn't want to get in the way of that," said Jezewski.

McCann coach Bob LeClair has gradually opened his offense for the past two
seasons. It doesn't hurt that junior quarterback Ben Raimer is as good as there
is in the Tri-County League. Last year, he threw for 942 yards and 10
touchdowns.

"I think we're going to keep doing it. With him being a junior, this is where we
need to be going," said LeClair.

The veteran coach, who has been a run-first kind of guy, started the final
installation after the final gun in 2007.

"As soon as the season ended, during the winter, I knew this was exactly what I
wanted to do," LeClair explained.

He went to clinics, watched a lot of University of Florida and West Virginia
tapes, and then moved forward.

"We talked to the team coming in, and they were very excited about it," he said.
"Our league is run-oriented. To start throwing it around is going to challenge
other teams."

EAGLES EYE STANFORD ASSISTANT / THEY'RE POISED TO NAME DANA BIBLE AS OFFENSIVE
COORDINATOR. HE KNOWS THE WEST COAST OFFENSE.

BYLINE: Phil Sheridan, INQUIRER STAFF WRITER

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. D04

LENGTH: 453 words


Dana Bible, who is expected to replace Jon Gruden as Eagles offensive
coordinator, has worked alongside some of the top practitioners of the so-called
West Coast-style offense.

An Eagles official confirmed yesterday that Bible will get the job. Bible, 44,
spent the last three seasons as offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach at
Stanford University. He has been in coaching on the collegiate and pro levels
since 1976, but this job would be by far his most visible and demanding.

The Eagles are expected to announce his hiring today.

Eagles head coach Ray Rhodes, unavailable for comment yesterday, said at the end
of the season that he would stick with some variation of the offense pioneered
by Hall of Fame coach Bill Walsh. Rhodes pointed out then that every coach had
his own variations of the system.

"The West Coast offense, the one Bill Walsh ran in the 1980s, I'm not sure that
still exists," Green Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre said last week. "There
are different styles. We run the Midwest Coast offense. We run the ball a lot
more, we throw a lot of screens.

"Really, any offense based on the short passing game is considered the West
Coast offense, but there are all different styles."

The Eagles settled on Bible, who could not be reached yesterday, to replace
Gruden, who last week was named head coach of the Oakland Raiders. Bible will
face a difficult task, even though the Eagles' offense was fifth in the NFL in
total yards last season.

Ricky Watters, the franchise running back, is expected to leave as a free agent.
His partner in the backfield, Charlie Garner, is also a free agent. The team
must retool an offensive line that allowed 64 sacks last season and is expected
to lose starting left guard Joe Panos to free agency.

Bible will oversee the development of young starting quarterback Bobby Hoying,
who will begin his third season, and try to find targets for Hoying. The team's
best wide receiver, Irving Fryar, is 36. Chris T. Jones, the other starter,
missed most of last season with a knee injury.

The new coordinator will have to find a starting tight end in a group that
includes Chad Lewis, Jason Dunn and veteran Jimmie Johnson.

Bible joined head coach Tyrone Willingham's staff in 1994, after one season as
offensive coordinator at the University of Cincinnati.

Before that, Bible spent three seasons as quarterbacks coach of the Cincinnati
Bengals, his only NFL experience. Bible coached Boomer Esiason and David
Klingler as an assistant to head coaches Sam Wyche and David Shula.

On the college level, Bible has coached such quarterbacks as Erik Kramer at
North Carolina State, and Dan McGwire and Todd Santos at San Diego State.

Kyle Shanahan's offense borrows from his mentors but is entirely his own

BYLINE: Mark Maske

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. D01

LENGTH: 880 words

DATELINE: HOUSTON


HOUSTON - The high-powered offense of the Atlanta Falcons has gotten them to the
Super Bowl. It has landed a head coaching job for offensive coordinator Kyle
Shanahan in San Francisco. It could yield a league MVP award for quarterback
Matt Ryan.

It all has worked not only because of the on-field brilliance of Ryan and wide
receiver Julio Jones but also because of Shanahan's offensive scheme. The system
is a blend of the West Coast offense learned from some of Shanahan's coaching
mentors - and his own father, Mike - with significant wrinkles he has added
himself.

"You see Gary [Kubiak's] offense in it," former Washington Redskins quarterback
Joe Theismann said. "You see Mike's offense in it. Every guy takes parts from
the guys he has worked with. What you see is an offense that has been developed
over time and adapted to Kyle's personality and the personnel that he has."

Mike Shanahan's offenses generally blended a traditional West Coast passing game
- the quick-hitting, stretch-the-defense-horizontally approach popularized by
the Bill Walsh-coached 49ers during their glory days - with a running game
utilizing zone blocking by the offensive line and "stretch" plays. That system
produced two Super Bowl triumphs for the Denver Broncos.

Kubiak, a Mike Shanahan coaching protege who was Kyle Shanahan's boss in Houston
and won last season's Super Bowl with the Broncos, was particularly enamored
with putting his quarterback on the move with rollouts and bootlegs.

When Mike Shanahan coached the Redskins and Kyle was the team's offensive
coordinator, they added college-style elements to their offense - the pistol
formation and option-style running plays - for quarterback Robert Griffin III's
rookie season in 2012.

Yet both Shanahans say that Kyle's current offense with the Falcons is
meaningfully different from his father's.

"Outside zone in running game is the same as before except for wider landmarks,"
Mike Shanahan said via text message. "QB keeps or bootlegs are the same as
before except for more variations. Everything else is different: drop-back
attack concepts, play-action concepts between the tackles, formation variations
and personnel groupings within a game plan, audible system, third-down attack,
red zone attack and two-minute offense."

Kyle Shanahan echoed those sentiments this week in Houston.

"I think we've all grown from different places," he said. "I think the one thing
we all have in common is that the basis, the percentage of our runs are outside
zone. And we do some [quarterback] bootlegs or keepers, whatever you want to
call them, off of that. After that, that's about it.

"When I got to Houston, it was my first time working for [Kubiak]. I had spent
all the time with Jon Gruden [as a Tampa Bay Buccaneers assistant] before that.
So we saw offense totally different. We meshed a little bit the first time
together. When I went to Washington, that was my first time working with my dad.
I thought we saw football similar. But we quickly realized after a few weeks
that we thought differently. We grew together. He gave me a lot of leeway while
I was there. It was fun to try a bunch of different things, having to even
incorporate the zone read and stuff when we got Robert. But it's always
growing."

The Falcons' passing game is not your father's - or, more precisely, Shanahan's
father's - West Coast passing game.

"There's a genesis to it," Theismann said this week. "It has been morphed and
expanded. People put their own personalities into it. The basic principles of
the West Coast offense are that you're going to get the ball out of the
quarterback's hand quickly and you're going to focus on getting yards after the
catch. You're going to use screens. You're going to get the ball into the hands
of the running back and treat those throws almost like running plays."

There is a vertical, down-the-field aspect to the Falcons' offense focused on
making certain that Jones gets his opportunities to make big plays.

"Kyle had Andre Johnson in Houston," Theismann said. "He had Pierre Garcon in
Washington. He has Julio Jones in Atlanta. He's got his guy, and he likes to
mold the offense around that. Kyle finds a guy that he concentrates on, and
that's the guy that the offense goes through. ... There are vertical aspects to
it. The West Coast offense traditionally was not about 'go' routes and fades. It
was posts and corners. I got into it once with Dwight Clark. I said, 'Joe
Montana can't throw a fade.' Dwight said, 'How many rings does he have?' "

The Falcons have a chance Sunday to win a Super Bowl title. But if they do
manage to upset the New England Patriots, it won't necessarily be another
championship for the offense of Walsh, Gruden, Mike Shanahan, Kubiak and others.
It will be a title for Kyle Shanahan's offense.

"We all originate from the same thing," Kyle Shanahan said. "If you go all the
way back to like, 'What's a West Coast offense?' - we use some of that
terminology. So that's why I think people would say some of this is West Coast.
But everybody's offense is different. And when you go different places, unless
you're just running a playbook, it always changes. And ours has changed every
year. It was different from the beginning. And it's grown a lot different over
the years."

FREAKNIK '99;
 Event's sedate start may signal end;
 Students leaving street party scene for job market

BYLINE: Kimberly Byrd, Ron Martz, Staff

SOURCE: AJC

LENGTH: 1053 words

Derrick Ham and his two buddies from Tennessee State University drove to Atlanta
Friday for Freaknik. But they came not for the rolling, raucous and often
raunchy street party the event has become, but for the job fair held in
conjunction with it at the World Congress Center Saturday.

The three 20-year-olds headed back to Tennessee Saturday night after handing out
resumes and seeing what might be available in the workplace after graduation.
They skipped the fun for their futures.

"We've done that and moved on," Ham said of Freaknik.

So, apparently have tens of thousands of other black college students.

What started slowly Friday continued Saturday at a pedestrian pace with crowds,
traffic and arrests down markedly from recent years. Either the Freaknik crowd
has matured or got word that Atlanta was cracking down on lewd and disrespectful
behavior, and participants decided to move the party elsewhere.

"I've been doing this since 1993, back when it was the real deal," said Clem
Dedmon III, 26, of Little Rock, at an Auburn Avenue festival for Freaknik
students. "This is the smallest crowd ever."

Atlanta police had no crowd estimates for Saturday's second day of the annual
gathering of black college students. But, based on the numbers of arrests made
and traffic citations issued, the crowds appear to be smaller, quieter and more
reserved.

"It's been pretty small potatoes so far when you get right down to it," Atlanta
police Lt. Calvin Moss said Saturday.

Chief Beverly Harvard said that as of 4 p.m. Saturday police had made 133
arrests, issued 178 citations and impounded 156 vehicles. Of the arrests and
citations, 300 were for traffic violations. Only four of those arrested or
ticketed were juveniles, police said, and 28 were college students.

Of particular significance, Harvard said, was the fact that no rapes or sexual
assaults were reported. In recent years, sexual assaults and reports of lewd
behavior characterized Freaknik.

"Thus far I am very pleased because we have not had any serious incidents at
all," Harvard said.

In addition to the traffic arrests and citations, Harvard said earlier Saturday
that there were 13 felonies, 39 misdemeanors and 53 citations for violating city
ordinances such as noise restrictions. The felonies included arrests for
possession of drugs or weapons.

Cooler temperatures and brisk winds Saturday may have played a role in reducing
crowd size and rowdy behavior. And some of the students may have been diverted
to last weekend's black spring break in Daytona Beach, Fla., and this weekend's
gathering in Galveston, Texas. Some women have also called for a boycott of
Freaknik because of problems in past years with lewd behavior and assaults on
women.

Of 311 people arrested or cited, according to police, 115 were Atlanta
residents, 103 were residents of Georgia other than Atlanta, and 92 were from
out of state.

Harvard said that the crowds have generally been cooperative with police
requests to turn down music and keep traffic moving.

"We haven't had any problems with the crowds. People are basically complying
with the officers when they approach, Harvard said.

The only significant traffic problem occurred on Peachtree Street in Midtown
late Friday and early Saturday morning, police said, before it was cleared up
about 3 a.m.

"It caused a minimal amount of inconvenience to the residents because most
residents are not out and about traveling on the streets at that time of the
morning," Harvard said.

Much of the focus of this year's Freaknik seemed to be on a job fair at the
World Congress Center. By Saturday afternoon, they were coming out in droves,
with more than 20,000 registered for the third annual event, making this year's
job fair more heavily attended than the 1998 event.

According to Ken Wimberly, of K & W Productions of Decatur, which planned the
fair, another 10,000 were expected to peddle resumes to the 150 companies on
hand before the fair ended at 5 p.m.

Students and other job seekers were standing in long lines by 8:30 a.m., dressed
in suits and carrying resumes under their arms, to attend seminars on how to
market themselves.

Fabian Williams, a graduating senior from East Carolina University in
Greenville, N.C., said by the looks of things Friday night, Freaknik is a goner.

An aspiring graphic designer, Williams said he arrived in Atlanta Friday to job
hunt and girl watch. After waiting in line two hours to get into the job fair,
he said it seemed he was having more luck with both at the World Congress Center
than on the streets.

Woodruff Park at downtown's Five Points and Lenox Square mall in Buckhead both
drew substantial crowds of young people Saturday evening.

But many of the people in South DeKalb Mall, where past Freaknik crowds have
gathered, appeared to be members of the New Birth Missionary Baptist Church in
South DeKalb County. Church members in T-shirts and black jackets were part of
an outreach ministry orchestrated by Bishop Eddie Long to deter lewd behavior
that has marked past Freakniks.

Uniformed police presence also was heavy at the mall.

The Black College Spring Break on Sweet Auburn festival drew crowds Saturday
afternoon of families and local residents as well as students for live bands and
peddlers of T-shirts, jewelry, crafts and food.

Police were highly visible on Auburn Avenue and throughout downtown. While
walking around the Auburn Avenue festival, Williams said police were ordering
him and others to get off barricades used to close the street, and to keep noise
down.

"Police were harassing me and I wasn't even doing anything," Williams said.

Joy Blackmon, 30, said the original purpose of Freaknik, which started as a
picnic for out-of-town students at Atlanta's predominantly black colleges, has
been lost. And based on news accounts, she said, it looks like Freaknik of the
'90s, a huge, cruising street party, is gone as well.

"It wasn't about violence," Blackmon, a graduate student from Alabama, said of
early Freakniks. "They were more festive, and people had respect for themselves
and others."

Selina Gilbert, a 29-year-old Atlanta resident who participated in Freaknik in
the late '80s, remembered the event as one where people "sat in the park and
chilled out over barbecues."

UCLA FOOTBALL: NORVELL GETS BRUINS' CALL

BYLINE: BY BRIAN DOHN Staff Writer

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. S5

LENGTH: 534 words


Jay Norvell didn't call the plays as Nebraska's offensive coordinator, but that
did not scare off UCLA coach Karl Dorrell.

Dorrell said Norvell's experience as Nebraska's offensive coordinator and
quarterbacks coach made him a great fit for UCLA.

But unlike in Lincoln, Norvell's role as offensive coordinator and quarterbacks
coach in Westwood will include calling the plays. His hiring was announced
Friday.

``He was the principal guy in orchestrating everything, and doing all the
meetings and putting all the installations in, and scripting all those things,''
Dorrell said. ``He's been very well trained for this next opportunity.

``It's almost the way I felt about (defensive coordinator) DeWayne (Walker) a
year ago, when everybody was concerned whether he was ready to be the defensive
coordinator, and he obviously proved he was ready for that.''

A lot is at stake for Norvell and Dorrell, who is expected to deliver a big
season with 20returning starters on offense and defense.

Norvell, 43, takes over for the Jim Svoboda, who was fired Jan. 18. He made
$225,000 with Nebraska, and sources said his salary could come close to $300,000
with UCLA. Norvell interviewed for the head coaching positions at Iowa State and
Boston College, and also was contacted by North Texas during the offseason.

It is the second time in threeyears Norvell interviewed for the UCLA position.
He was previously passed over for Tom Cable. Sources said Dorrell contacted
Cable several times in the last week, but a formal interview did not take place.
Cable, who was part of the fired Atlanta Falcons staff, is expected to remain in
the NFL.

``One of the things we've been able to establish here at Nebraska in a short
time is a pro-style attack that's very multiple, that plays with good tempo,''
said the 43-year-old Norvell, who spent six seasons as an assistant with the
Indianapolis Colts and Oakland Raiders. ``We're coming to UCLA to install this
system, and we're going to be extremely demanding of these kids. We're going to
have the highest expectations of this offense.''

Nebraska and Louisville were the only schools to rank in the top 25 in rushing
offense, passing offense, total offense and scoring offense. The Cornhuskers
were 23rd in rushing (1,705ypg) and passing (244.1ypg), 14th in total offense
(414.6 ypg) and 17th in scoring (30.6 ppg).

Cornhuskers quarterback Zac Taylor was the Big 12 Conference Offensive Player of
the Year after establishing school records for passing yards (3,197) and
touchdowns (26) while completing 59.6 percent of his passes.

``What intrigued me about him was they were able to do it quickly in Nebraska,
and had had good results in a timely manner,'' Dorrell said. ``Plus, he's
developed a quarterback quickly there as well.''

Norvell might not be the last change on the coaching staff.

Offensive line coach and assistant head coach Jim Colletto is a candidate to
become the Detroit Lions offensive line coach.

``He's really torn,'' Dorrell said about Colletto. ``He has an opportunity, and
he obviously has an attraction of coaching in the NFL, but he had a great
attraction about doing what he did here at UCLA last year. He's mulling it
over.''

Broncos lose Heimerdinger to Titans Back at Tennessee, he'll have full control
of the offense.

BYLINE: Bill Williamson The Denver Post

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. D-09

LENGTH: 336 words


Mike Heimerdinger said he would leave Denver for just one other spot in the NFL,
and Thursday that move became official.

Heimerdinger has returned to the Tennessee Titans as offensive coordinator. For
the past two seasons, Heimerdinger has been the assistant head coach in charge
of the passing game in Denver.

Heimerdinger was a successful offensive coordinator in Tennessee earlier this
decade.

He said Thursday the only reason he departed Denver was for the chance of
running an offense again. In Denver, coach Mike Shanahan has final say on the
offense. Heimerdinger, Shanahan and Titans coach Jeff Fisher are friends, and
Shanahan granted the Titans' request for permission to speak to Heimerdinger on
Wednesday.

"The only reason I left was to run the whole offense," said

Heimerdinger, who replaces Norm Chow in Tennessee. "I'm going where I'll be
calling all the plays and running the offense. There is nothing else to read
into it. Having the whole offense is the reason. ... The Broncos are a great
franchise and Mr. (Pat) Bowlen and Mike run a great franchise."

Denver is expected to elevate Jeremy Bates to an expanded role in the offense.
Bates, 31, coached the quarterbacks and receivers last season and is considered
one of the brightest young offensive minds in the NFL. Bates, the son of former
assistant head coach in charge of defense Jim Bates, has a good working
relationship with quarterback Jay Cutler.

Bates' increased role may or may not come with a title change. Shanahan also is
expected to work more with the offense.

The Broncos still are interested in former UCLA head coach and Colorado
assistant Karl Dorrell, but if he is brought in, it likely would be as a
receivers coach.

Dorrell was in Kansas City on Thursday night and may be hired as the Chiefs'
receivers coach. Dorrell also interviewed in Miami this week. If Dorrell goes
elsewhere, Denver might not hire a receivers coach. Dorrell was Denver's
receivers coach before going to UCLA.

Time for the weekly Big 12 efficiency rankings, and with Thanksgiving fast
approaching, the teams are settling in to who they are.Baylor has the league's
best offense. Texas has the league's best defense. Kansas and OSU are waltzing
to determine the league's worst offense. Texas Tech and Iowa State are the
candidates for the league's worst defense, maybe in conference history.Remember,
efficiency measures how often an offense scores. Full credit for a touchdown,
half credit for a field goal. Same with the defense. Getting off the field
without allowing a point is the defense's job. Full credit for a stop. Half
credit for a field goal.OFFENSIVE EFFICIENCY

Baylor .452:And the Bears haven't even got a crack yet at that historically-bad
Texas Tech defense.TCU .422:The Frog offense vs. the Longhorn defense on
Thanksgiving night should be quite the show.Kansas State .417:Don't expect the
Wildcats to stay this high. K-State still has to face three decent defenses --
West Virginia, Kansas and Baylor.Oklahoma .372:This about right for the Sooners.
A good offense, but not the Big 12's best.West Virginia .299:Who would have ever
guessed that the Mountaineer defense would outshine the Mountaineer offense
?Texas Tech .285:Not up to Tech's offensive standard, but not Tech's biggest
problem, by a long shot.Texas .271:Since that shutout in Manhattan, the
Longhorns have been gradually getting better on offense.Iowa State .247:Not as
good as it needs to be for the Cyclones to be bowl contenders.Oklahoma State
.204:With Baylor and OU left, it's quite possible that the Cowboys finish last
in the Big 12 in offensive efficiency. Think about that.Kansas .197:KU is
looking much better offensively. This number was a lot lower.

DEFENSIVE EFFICIENCY

Texas .190:The Big 12's best defense, by a wide margin.West Virginia
.250:Probably will finish the year No. 2 in defensive efficiency. The
Mountaineers finish with K-State and Iowa State.Baylor .250:The Bears have a
couple of tough tests after OSU's hapless offense this week. Baylor finishes
with Tech and K-State.Kansas State .254:Good number. Anything below .300 is good
defense.TCU .283:Giving up four touchdowns to Kansas sounds some alarms.Kansas
.332:A better defensive performance than Oklahoma so far. I repeat, a better
defensive performance than the Sooners.Oklahoma .343:OU will look a lot better
at season's end. With Kansas and OSU remaining, the Sooners should rise in the
defensive rankings.Oklahoma State .346:When your offense is in the .400s, you
can live with a number like this. When your offense is flirting with the .100s,
this kills you.Iowa State .432:There's no telling where the Cyclones will
finish. This number could go higher.Texas Tech .459:I really ought to go back
and find the worst Big 12 defense ever. It's very possible that this is it. Tech
is basically giving up a touchdown virtually every other possession.

PROJECTIONSWe can use these numbers to guesstimate the approximate score. Here
are this week's games:Kansas at OU: Sooners 32-25. Better not be this close.OSU
at Baylor: Bears 38-22. No way it will be this close.Kansas State at West
Virginia: Wildcats 30-25. Should be a good in Morgantown. This projection system
works best when matching teams of equal strength.Texas Tech at Iowa State:
34-34. Overtime in Ames!

Hochman: Another clunker for Lock, MU offense

BYLINE:  By Benjamin Hochman St. Louis Post-Dispatch

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. C1

LENGTH: 753 words


COLUMBIA, Mo. o Well, now everyone knows.

It was the SEC's secret - Mizzou's offense is the worst in all the power
conferences.

But on Thursday night, a national television audience was subjected to our
state's state. Journalists and personalities started tweeting about Mizzou's
delightfully inept offense.

"I don't know why, but I now find Missouri's offense mesmerizing," tweeted USA
Today writer Nicole Auerbach. "Can't look away."

Where is the pride on this Mizzou offense? Where is that second-effort grit?

Even when the veteran Maty Mauk was playing, this offense was slipshod. And now,
it's a national joke. The same team that played in the past two SEC title games
has the worst offense in the conference. In all the power conferences.

The Tigers lost 31-13 on Thursday. This loss was the best loss, if that's a
thing, of the previous four, because in this loss, they actually scored a
touchdown.

"Sometimes the offense is playing bad, sometimes the defense is playing bad,"
linebacker Kentrell Brothers said. "If we're not working together, we're not
going to win many games."

In a perfect world this season, Mauk would rise to the challenge of having
competition in-house, and that the shaggy-haired competition, freshman Drew
Lock, would play multiple series during games. Not be the starter. But push the
starter. The tandem would bring out the best of each other.

Instead, Mauk is gone, and Lock is suffering growing pains.

Is he growing though?

Coach Gary Pinkel was asked point blank - do you see progress in Lock since the
South Carolina game that you think other people are missing?

"First of all, I don't care what anybody (on the outside) thinks, I've never
done that since becoming a coach," he said. "Everybody's favorite quarterback is
the backup quarterback, until he doesn't play well, and then they want the next
backup quarterback. OK? I thought he had a really good drive there toward the
end, made some plays, but I'm not going to go through a (public) evaluation of
our quarterbacks."

In regards to Lock, many Missourians have given a pass to the passer. He's a
freshman, he's a huge recruit, he'll be fine. All three sentiments will probably
prove to be true. But there has to be some accountability demanded, for
instance, when he threw the worst pass in pass history.

With 12:05 left in the third, Lock scrambled and backpedaled right and then
released a lob. It hovered toward a Mississippi State player, however two other
Bulldogs were also closer than the Mizzou receiver. Interception.

"That's called a poor decision," Pinkel said. "He can't do that, so we'll work
on getting it better."

Lovely Shreveport - that's the oxymoron that looms as some SEC team's bowl game
destination.

Mizzou faithful are quite familiar with the Louisiana city that's home to the
Camping World Independence Bowl - three times during the Pinkel era, the Tigers
have played in said bowl. It is, depending on who you ask, the "tenth" of the 10
SEC bowl bids, though Birmingham is also in the conversation.

When the Tigers went to Shreveport in 2011, to face North Carolina, it wasn't,
necessarily, a thrilling reward.

But at this point in 2015, earning a fourth trip to Shreveport would be a decent
consolation prize for the consternation that's been this fall's fall.

Twice in the SEC title game in the past two years, the Tigers are now 4-5. The
goal is a bowl, whether it's Charlotte or Shreveport or Schenectady. Shreveport
would be lovely for this Tiger team, because 6-6 and bowl eligibility is not
guaranteed. After Thursday's game against Mississippi State, the Tigers
remaining schedule featured Brigham Young, which is 6-2, and then Tennessee and
Arkansas, both 4-4.

Pinkel often shares this sort-of rhyme: "Those who win in November will be
remembered." It's a good mantra, a la the pro coaches who preach to a team that
a game's fourth quarter is "money time." Pinkel's sentiment is - those who
ascend in November will benefit in some way, whether it's making a bowl game or,
at least, providing optimism after a frustrating October.

"If we can win two of them, we're in a bowl game," said Brothers, snubbed this
week by the Butkus Award, and on Thursday played angry and hungry, like
Jefferson in "Fast Times In Ridgemont High," after his car was totaled. "I was
here when we didn't go to a bowl game, and those seniors were pretty upset,
their last game being played and them losing to not make a bowl. It was hard to
watch. Now the season is near the end and the fact that could actually happen,
it feels worse."

New jerseys can't change state of offense

BYLINE: Gene Frenette

SECTION: Gene Frenette; Pg. C-1

LENGTH: 551 words


At some point, all the alleged tweaking of Florida's struggling offense by Urban
Meyer has to reap some dividends. The Gators hired Mr. Hot Coach because he had
a reputation for successfully attacking defenses, but there's been little
evidence of that against a quality opponent, except an 80-yard touchdown drive
against Tennessee.

Today against fourth-ranked Georgia at Alltel Stadium, it's high time for Meyer
to show that his team hasn't forgotten how to move the football. I'm not
suggesting that Florida should or will light up the scoreboard, but Meyer had
nearly two weeks to help quarterback Chris Leak become more of a threat against
the Bulldogs than he was against LSU or Alabama.

Last year, the Gators averaged 31.4 points per game against SEC opponents,
compared to just 24.0 points this season. And the alarming part is UF's defense
is getting turnovers and putting the offense in better position to score, but
the production is lagging.

Florida will unveil new uniforms today designed by Nike featuring an orange
sleeve that is similar to the gaudy-looking style worn by Virginia Tech in
Thursday night's win over Boston College. It always creates a buzz any time a
major college sports a new uniform, but that won't mean a whole lot to Gator
fans unless UF's offense does something to reinvent itself.

Florida's quarterback has 28 career starts and 55 touchdown passes, while
Georgia quarterback Joe Tereshinski III is making his first start in place of
D.J. Shockley. If UF can't turn things around in a game with that matchup, it's
going to be a final month of the season.

The guess here is that the Florida offense wakes up just enough to make the SEC
East race interesting. Florida 20, Georgia 17. . . .

The Jaguars' waiting-to-evolve offense is running out of excuses. Between the
defensively challenged St. Louis Rams on Sunday and the winless Houston Texans
at home next week, the team's 56-game streak of not scoring 30 points should
come to an end. Quarterback Byron Leftwich and this unit can only be a work in
progress for so long. . . .

How about that World Seriezzzzzzzzzzzz? Talk about must-sleep TV. One question
for baseball commissioner Bud Selig: Don't you think you have a problem when
even a 1-0 game ends past midnight Eastern time? . . . Whatever you think of
animated Chicago White Sox manager Ozzie Guillen, he allows his starting
pitchers to empty their tank. That's the primary reason the White Sox had the
best playoff run (11-1) of any team since baseball instituted the wild card. . .
.

Anyone notice how Tom Coughlin's petty rules and taskmaster ways have become a
non-issue with the New York Giants? When his teams are losing, Coughlin is
Terrible Tom. When his teams are winning, Coughlin becomes Tolerable Tom. . . .
No word yet from the Pittsburgh Steelers on whether the man caught and fined
$300 for impersonating quarterback Ben Roethlisberger will actually move ahead
of Tommy Maddox on the depth chart. . . .

Pigskin forecast: Jaguars over St. Louis Rams by 3 (healthier starters); Florida
State over Maryland by 13 (jump-ball passes); Miami over North Carolina by 7
(days until Virginia Tech turns out the lights); Tennessee over South Carolina
by 10 (times a better defense). Last week: 5 right, 0 Fisher DeBerrys.

Pease wants IU to run fast tempo offense

BYLINE: Dustin Dopirak, Herald-Times, Bloomington, Ind.

SECTION: SPORTS

LENGTH: 961 words


Dec. 31--At an introductory meeting with Indiana beat reporters earlier this
month, new IU football coach Kevin Wilson joked about the reasons Oklahoma needs
to take Connecticut seriously in Saturday's Fiesta Bowl.

Wilson, who will coach tight ends and fullbacks for Oklahoma in that game before
leaving the Sooners for good, remembers well the fallout from another Fiesta
Bowl that everybody figured Oklahoma would win. In that case, everybody figured
wrong.

"They'll be told all month they can't win," Wilson said. "They'll be all fired
up, then your team shows up there and you get beat and everybody laughs at you
for nine months, and you're on the cover of EA Sports and all that stuff. That's
what happens. Been there, done that."

But what also can happen, apparently, is you get a future offensive coordinator
out of the deal.

The game he's referring to, of course, is the 2007 Fiesta Bowl when the mighty
Sooners fell 43-42 in overtime to then little-known upstart Boise State in a
trick-play filled thriller that is widely regarded as one of the most exciting
college football games of the past decade if not ever. On the sideline across
from Wilson, who was then Oklahoma's offensive coordinator, was Brent Pease, who
on Tuesday was named Wilson's first offensive coordinator/quarterbacks coach at
Indiana. Pease was the wide receivers coach there, and added the title of
assistant head coach in 2007. He held that position until taking the job with
the Hoosiers.

"That just came down to the kids making plays," Pease said. "It was just great
energy. But you run into each other afterwards, and you talk about what could
have been and what your offense did against their defense and what their offense
did against your defense."

By that point, Pease and Wilson already had a good understanding of each other
as offensive minds. They coached against each other in the Big 12 from 2003 to
2005 when Pease was the offensive coordinator at Baylor. Before that, Pease was
the offensive coordinator at Kentucky for two seasons. Before arriving in
Lexington, he spent 10 years coaching in what was then known as Division I-AA.
He was offensive coordinator at Northern Arizona for two years and served as
offensive coordinator among other positions at I-AA power Montana, his alma
mater, for eight years. Pease led the nation in total offense in 1986 as a
quarterback for the Grizzlies and spent two years in the NFL with the Houston
Oilers after being drafted by the Minnesota Vikings. He also spent time in the
Canadian Football League, the World League of American Football and the Arena
Football League.

Both Wilson and Pease have experience in wide-open schemes that produce a lot of
offense, but they also don't marry themselves to any one formation. Oklahoma and
Boise State can both run spread formations, but also load up the backfield for
the run.

"We're going to do things that fit our personnel," Pease said. "There are things
we like to do, but most importantly, we're going to do things that our line can
block and things our quarterback can handle."

But one thing neither favors is a slow, plodding offense. As has been
well-documented, Wilson's 2008 Oklahoma squad scored more points than any team
in FBS history. Pease helped an offense this year that ranks fourth in the FBS
in total offense (519.5 points per game) and second in scoring (46.7 points per
game). This year's Broncos finished 12-1 with a win over Utah in the Las Vegas
Bowl after heart-wrenching loss to Nevada that cost it another BCS bid.

"Fast tempo," Pease said when asked what kind of offense he'd like to play. "We
want to make big plays. We want to play explosive football. I like to be
balanced between the run and the pass so everybody is part of the equation. I
like to get a lot of guys involved. We want to build good depth as far as skill
players."

Pease said he's impressed with what he knows about IU's returning offensive
players, especially the wide receivers. Senior Terrance Turner graduates, but
the Hoosiers could return the rest of the most productive receiving corps in the
Big Ten. That is if juniors Tandon Doss and Damarlo Belcher decide not to test
the NFL waters. Even if they don't, there is impressive young talent behind them
in freshmen Duwyce Wilson, Kofi Hughes, Jammone Chester and others.

The Hoosiers also have a stable of running backs that could return depending on
how they heal from injuries, an impressive group of tight ends and a useful if
not dominant offensive line. Pease will have to deal with some turmoil at his
position. Dusty Kiel and Edward Wright Baker, who will be redshirt sophomores in
the 2011 season, will be competing for the starting job vacated by two-year
starter Ben Chappell.

"I think it's good because it will make them both better," Pease said. "I've
done that other times when I've made other moves. It gives them an opportunity
to audition."

Wilson released a statement about Pease's hire, but was not available for
further comment.

"We are pleased and excited Brent is joining us," Wilson said. "He had an
excellent playing career in the collegiate and professional ranks. Brent has
coordinated in the Big 12 and the SEC, and he is coming from one of the most
dominant programs in college football over the last decade in Boise State. We
look forward to integrating his offensive ideas from Boise State into to what we
have done in the past."

Ideas that Wilson knows all too well.

Utes will likely need top offense for Air Force

BYLINE: By Michael C. Lewis The Salt Lake Tribune

SECTION: UTAH UTES; College Sports; Sports

LENGTH: 444 words


For the second week in a row, coach Kyle Whittingham has praised his Utah Utes
for playing their best game of the season on offense.

Good thing, too.

That's because the Utes figure to need all the offense they can muster when they
travel to play Air Force in a crucial Mountain West Conference game at Falcon
Stadium on Saturday (5:30 p.m., TV: mtn). The Falcons have averaged nearly 38
points per game against Utah the past three years, though the Utes have escaped
with victories each time by averaging 44 points on offense.

"The best defense against Air Force is a good offense . . . that can keep them
off the field," Whittingham said.

The Falcons are 4-5 and coming off a 39-17 home loss to No. 9 Notre Dame, but
own the nation's third-best running game, and have given the Utes everything
they can handle in recent years with their deceptive option rushing attack.

Commitments

The Utes have picked up oral commitments from junior-college safety Deshawn
Richard and high school linebacker Nai Fotu, bringing to nine the number of
players who have said they will sign letters-of-intent with Utah in February.

Richard is 6-foot-1, 195-pound safety at Victor Valley College in Victorville,
Calif. He said he chose the Utes over offers from Wyoming, Louisiana Tech and
Oregon State for the opportunity to start next season; the Utes lose seniors
Casey Evans and Eric Weddle. Fotu plays at Kahuku High School in Hawaii, and is
listed in various places as either 5-11 and 242 pounds or 6-0 and 220. He
reportedly had offers from Arizona and Hawaii.

Bowl scenario

Want to win a trip to San Diego?

Cheer against the Frogs.

The Utes are competing primarily with Texas Christian to fill the league's place
in the Poinsettia Bowl in San Diego, but could get ignored if the Horned Frogs
win out to finish 10-2 overall, or come close.

"While it's not completely the only factor, we do take into strong consideration
won-loss records," said Bruce Binkowski, the executive director of the bowl.

The Poinsettia Bowl has the second choice of eligible teams from the Mountain
West, behind the Las Vegas Bowl - which is sure to take Brigham Young, presuming
the Cougs win one of their last two games. If the Poinsettia does pick TCU,
then, the Utes would be left to play in either the New Mexico Bowl in
Albuquerque or the Armed Forces Bowl in Fort Worth, Texas.

And don't think that just because the Horned Frogs might like to play a bowl
game in their home stadium, the Poinsettia Bowl would negotiate to choose a
different team and let the Armed Forces Bowl have them.

"It's possible," Binkowski said, "but I wouldn't put stock in it completely. We
have to do what's best for us."

Purdy: 49ers offense improving, but still not finishing

BYLINE: By Mark Purdy Mercury News Columnist

SECTION: SPORTS; Breaking; 49ers; Columnists; News; Football; Columnists

LENGTH: 865 words


According to his coach, Alex Smith played the best game of his 49ers life Monday
night.

Maybe so. But the team still lost.

Therein lies a lesson. And the lesson is: The 49ers' offense still needs to do
better. Much, much better. Just because Smith looked confident leading a
fourth-quarter comeback to tie the score doesn't mean the 49ers' issues are
cleared up.

The good news is, Smith gets the lesson.

As he left the locker room Monday, I asked the 49ers quarterback if the 25-22
loss to New Orleans on the game's final play felt the same to him as last
season's punch-in-the-gut loss at Minnesota on a Brett Favre pass in the final
seconds.

"No, this is something different," Smith said. "At Minnesota, I think we led the
whole way and lost it at the end. So I think that was more devastating. In this
game, most of our self-inflicted wounds happened early. "... We had all those
chances in the red zone or near the red zone but had turnovers, so we only wound
up with 22 points. We feel like we should have had more."

Correct, correct and correct. But what are Smith and the 49ers going to do about
it? Their next game is at Kansas City inside Arrowhead Stadium, one of the NFL's
loudest venues. And there are no carry-over points from Smith's
attention-grabbing, fourth-quarter performance. This year's 49ers offense still
has not proved it can simultaneously grab attention and grab a victory.

Thank goodness, we seem to have moved past the 49ers era of having a top-gun
defense mixed with a popgun offense. But it's not as if the offense has pulled
even with the defense. There is still a large discrepancy between the two units.
After two games, the 49ers' defense ranks fourth in the NFL. The 49ers' offense
ranks 11th, but it is 28th in third-down efficiency and the team is 24th in
points scored.

What's that? You say the offensive numbers are deceptive because the 49ers'
offense was so lousy in Week 1 at Seattle but then turned a corner Monday
against the Saints? I beg to differ. In the most important respect -- inability
to efficiently convert scoring opportunities -- the two games were much the
same.

Let's review:

In Seattle, the 49ers offense was actually very impressive for the first half
and drove inside the Seahawks' 20-yard line three times "... but only scored six
total points in those three trips because bad execution stalled drives. Smith
also threw two interceptions in the game.

Against the Saints, the 49ers' offense drove inside the Saints' 30-yard line six
times "... but wound up with just 22 points instead of 28 or 35 points because
of Smith's two interceptions and a fumble by Delanie Walker.

In both cases, the 49ers kept getting in their own way as they tried to reach
the end zone. So why was Week 2 considered such an improvement over Week 1?
Apparently because of that fourth quarter tie-the-score drive. Smith certainly
deserves applause for that. The drive probably boosted his confidence. But it
didn't make up for the early mistakes. Not all were Smith's fault, of course.
You can't blame him for the ball that was snapped by David Baas so high over
Smith's head that it almost interfered with SFO plane traffic. But his first
interception, when he had trouble making a tough throw to running back Frank
Gore, was preventable.

"Putting ourselves in the hole earlier in the game hurt us in the end," Smith
said. "That's how I look at it."

The 49ers also have a fundamental quirk in their offensive package that needs to
get un-quirked. Through two games, the 49ers have rushed the ball 45 times and
completed 49 passes. This is known as "balance."

But look closer at those 49 passes. Only 15 were caught by wide receivers. The
rest were thrown to running backs (15) or tight ends (19).

This is known as "trouble waiting to happen," because if opposing defenses don't
have to worry greatly about wide receivers doing damage, their job is a lot
easier.

Singletary said Tuesday that he was "not exactly" happy with the distribution of
passes so far. But he attributed it to the comfort level Smith has with Gore and
tight end Vernon Davis. Josh Morgan had eight catches Monday, so it's obvious
the comfort is building between him and Smith. But it doesn't exist yet with
Michael Crabtree, who had just one catch Monday after two receptions in Seattle.

Gore and Davis are the 49ers' two best offensive players, so the ball must touch
their fingers more often. But for points to happen consistently, Crabtree must
be involved consistently. It is clear that his absence from many summer-camp
practices with a neck injury was a more significant factor than first imagined.

"He missed both training camps: one for the holdout, one because of injury,"
Singletary said of Crabtree. "But he's working hard to get on the same page,
working his tail off. And you know, at some point in time, he's going to be a
tremendous weapon for us."

How about Sunday in Kansas City? That would be good. The 49ers' defense is going
to hold opponents to three touchdowns or fewer every week. It would be nice to
see Smith and his offensive pals get four or five.

In fact, for the 49ers to have a winning season, it will be mandatory.

JETS COACH EDWARDS SAMPLES THE OFFENSE THAT BILL WALSH MADE FAMOUS WITH THE
49ERS WEST COAST STYLE GOES EAST

BYLINE: DENNIS GEORGATOS, Mercury News

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 15D

LENGTH: 777 words


When Herman Edwards became coach of the New York Jets in January, he inherited
18 of 22 starters from a team that finished one game out of the playoffs.

That doesn't mean the first-time head coach shied away from change.

Under Edwards, 47, who was raised in Seaside and returns to the Monterey
Peninsula each off-season to run a football camp for underprivileged children,
the Jets have installed a version of the West Coast offense similar to that of
the 49ers, their opponent Monday night.

They're not as accomplished at it as the 49ers, who have been operating the
scheme since Bill Walsh brought it to the team in 1979.

But the Jets have joined the crowd. Fifteen NFL teams run a variation of the
West Coast offense, a precision scheme centered on the quarterback and the
timely delivery of passes based on a progression of reads.

"We all fell off the same tree," said 49ers coach Steve Mariucci, who often
refers to the new generation of West Coast proponents as Walsh's grandchildren
and great-grandchildren.

Fans of the offense

The Jets had a ball-control offense and a 3-4 defensive scheme with Bill
Parcells and his one-season replacement last year, Al Groh. They opened this
season with a 45-24 loss to Indianapolis before getting Edwards his first
victory, 10-3 at New England last week.

Edwards, who spent 10 years in the NFL as a defensive back and began his
coaching career as an assistant at San Jose State in 1987-89, said he long
admired the efficiency of the 49ers' offense.

"Obviously, I think we're playing a very productive offense," Edwards said.
"I've kind of watched them from afar, and from living in California, I kind of
keep up with the California teams. I think they're a team that poses a lot of
problems."

That remains Edwards' hope for the Jets' offense, which is overseen by
coordinator Paul Hackett, a former assistant to Walsh.

Mariucci said the Jets run a more basic version of the West Coast offense to
tailor it to their best skill players.

"They stay in their base personnel group quite a bit," he said. "They don't jump
into three and four wide receivers like a lot of teams do. But they really rely
on their running game and Curtis Martin, which was indicative in their win at
New England last week."

Growing pains

Jets quarterback Vinny Testaverde said he was a longtime fan of the West Coast
offense but concedes it will take time to get acclimated as evidenced by
struggles to get his wide receivers more involved. Wayne Chrebet and Laveranues
Coles rank third and fourth on the team in receiving behind running backs Martin
and Richie Anderson and tight end Anthony Becht.

"I think we have the ability to be very successful with this system," Testaverde
said. "But I knew we were going to experience some growing pains. I think we're
making strides each day, and that's the exciting thing."

Edwards said: "We show little signs at times, and then we turn around and maybe
don't hit the play when it's open. That's just the effect when you come in with
a new staff and new systems on both sides of the ball. I'm going to be patient,
and every week, hopefully we can improve."

Sweating such details have become a matter of course for Edwards, who was
involved in football for 30 years as a college and NFL player, scout and
assistant coach before landing his first head-coaching job.

"You're really humbled when you get an opportunity to do this, because there are
only so many NFL head-coaching jobs," Edwards said. "I think you learn about
yourself. You learn about the emotions that you have to bring to the table every
day. Because there are a menu of things that come across your desk that
obviously are not in the Coaching 101 handbook."

That included wrestling with the range of feelings in the aftermath of the Sept.
11 attacks that leveled New York's World Trade Center

Jets players visited with firefighters and police and also had a chance to view
the devastation as a team.

"We got on some buses, we dressed up in work clothes and we went down there and
pitched in," Edwards said.

Gaining perspective

It was a sobering interlude from football. Even as the team resumed playing last
week, its first thought was to pay tribute to the spirit of its wounded city
with plans to present New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani the game ball.

"It was the best thing to do for our football team and for this organization to
give something to the city and to all the people who have been helpful in the
rescue operations," Edwards said. "I think people understand that it was a
tragedy, but our country is also about moving on. It's not about forgetting, but
we have to move on."

TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN Mizzou has certainly arrived in the SEC thanks to a more
macho offense this season.

BYLINE:   BRYAN BURWELL o bburwell@post-dispatch.com

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. C5

LENGTH: 1111 words


ATLANTA, Ga. o Every day now, there are tangible bits of evidence of Mizzou's
dramatic success that keep popping up all over the place. Whether it's news of
another star player being a finalist for some fancy award, Coach Gary Pinkel
tamping down gossip about potentially enriching job offers, or just the rather
curious sight of the Mizzou football brand being splashed on prominent display
here on downtown streets deep in the heart of Dixie, it's quite apparent that
Mizzou football has arrived at a rather prominent plateau on the national stage.

Yes, the Tigers have certainly arrived.

SEC East champs and rising fast in that elusive national public recognition
factor on the eve of the SEC Championship game on Saturday in the Georgia Dome.

They are not quite an instantly identifiable national brand, still a notch below
the likes of Florida State, Auburn, Alabama and Ohio State when it comes to the
drumbeat of recognition, when it comes to the buzz of national conversation and
debate surrounding who deserves a spot in the final rendition of the BCS's
so-called national championship game.

But here they are in Atlanta with an outside shot at that BCS national
championship game, and I can't help but believe that none of this could have
truly happened if the Tigers had stayed in the Big 12.

If they remained in the Big 12, David Yost would likely still be the offensive
coordinator. If they remained in the Big 12, Mizzou's offense would still be
heavy on finesse and light on muscle. They would still be a video-game offense
ringing up Baylor-like scores and producing lovely highlight reel shows of a
pass-happy spread offense.

And they'd never have the balance to rise to the rarefied air where they are
right now.

The SEC forced Pinkel to redesign his offense and I'm glad he did.

They wouldn't be here if he hadn't been willing to make some important
modifications to the spread. It's a macho spread. It's a manly spread. In the
hands of new offensive coordinator Josh Henson, it's a run-first, balanced
attack that is the perfect blend of new-age and old-school snobber-knocker
football.

"I like it, I like that a lot," said Mizzou senior guard Max Copeland, cackling
like some giddy, raspy-voiced school boy. "Boy do I welcome that perception."

If you have never seen Copeland in the flesh, perhaps you wouldn't understand
why he was so pumped up about the premise of this column.

He is a 6-foot-3, 300-pound pure block of muscle with flowing, shoulder-length
red hair and a scraggly beard that would give Cardinals reliever Jason Motte a
run for his money. He looks like someone who ought to be playing football in the
mud. He looks like someone who ought to have a thick black scab on the bridge of
his nose that oozes blood the minute he snaps on his helmet (which he does).

A few years ago, the symbol of the Mizzou offense was Chase Daniel, a stocky
gun-slinging QB who was the trigger man for the Tigers fast-break offense.

Now Copeland is the symbol.

Mizzou's offense is still loaded with flashy offensive stars, but Copeland and
his fellow grungy offensive line mates are the heart and soul of this offense
now.

Ask Copeland what the main difference is between the spread offense when he
arrived in Columbia five years ago and he has a simple answer.

"Beards," he cackled. "Gotta be the beards."

Well it's not the beards, but it's the attitude behind the beards and the
emphasis that Henson has created with his offensive redesign that includes true,
blocking tight ends, running backs actually lining up in the backfield and
offensive linemen who put their hands in the dirt, rarely line up in wide splits
and who want to pound on you rather than trick you.

"It's all about Coach Henson," says Copeland. "You know what? It's a real good
representation of our offensive coordinator. It really represents who you are,
and Coach Henson wanted to design an offense that had a two-pronged approach."

Pinkel says the changes weren't necessarily made out of necessity, but I'm not
buying it. Last year, even with the injuries that hampered Mizzou, this offense
was not functioning the right way against SEC defenses. Yost was a firm believer
in his brand of the spread, and never felt the need to compromise. He believed
the same things that worked in the Big 12 would work in the SEC.

But what Yost wasn't willing to admit or recognize was how whenever Mizzou
stepped up in weight class in the Big 12 against Oklahoma or Texas or Nebraska,
it rarely went well.

But Henson is a man quite familiar with the SEC and his style and personality
was just what the Tigers needed. "I don't think (the changes) were a necessity
for the SEC," said Henson. "It's just something I believed in, period. You have
to have a certain ability to run the football and be tough and physical. I just
felt we needed some balance this year. And from a roster standpoint, I also felt
we really wanted to use some of our guys to help us win some games."

Those "guys" Henson was talking about are his trio of tailbacks Henry Josey,
Russell Hansbrough and Marcus Murphy. They are fast, tough runners who love the
power and speed game. They love to settle in behind those big linemen and burst
through slivers of daylight or wide slashes of grass. In the past, this was a
team that had to out-shoot you to win. Now, they are a team that wants to beat
you up and grind you up, get a lead and then pound the ball on clock-gobbling
four-, five- or six-minute drives.

"We're a more physical team, more dominant," said Josey. "We have opponents who
I don't think they like us very much when we're finished playing. We like to
give it to them physically. We want to beat you, dominate you. We take pride in
relaying that message to the other guys."

So there are running backs who love to control the game. There are the linemen
who are aligned barely a foot apart and there are tight ends like Eric Waters
who lines up like a conventional tight end and enhances the running game with
his strong blocking ability. It causes defenses to load up with seven or eight
men in the box to stop the run, thus exposing their secondary to dangerous
man-to-man coverage against Mizzou's fleet of tall and talented receivers like
L'Damian Washington, Dorial Green-Beckham and Marcus Lucas.

"We could still have the finesse," said Copeland, "but when you need to put your
knuckles in the dirt, that's something we also want to take a lot of pride in."

His voice was rising now, like a gravelly-voiced preacher sermonizing the
virtues of old-school, macho football.

"As an offensive lineman, knowing we're going to be in there grinding," said
Copeland, flashing a delighted grin. "And that's something you really want,
man."

Crime problems can be overcome, but we must find rational solutions

BYLINE: By Jim Minter

SECTION: EXTRA; Section I; Page 2

LENGTH: 751 words


Gary Colley, a 34-year-old Englishman, pulled into an interstate highway rest
stop to catch a nap and became the ninth foreign visitor slain in Florida since
last October and the second in less than a week. Thirteen days later, a visitor
from New York City is killed in Miami. Police there are calling it a random,
drive-by shooting.

Colley's father at home in England says ours is a sick country. Stupid would be
more accurate. We are allowing ourselves to be terrorized by a small group of
criminals, many of them juveniles. Between chamber of commerce types, apologetic
bureaucrats, outdated laws, too-lenient courts, knee-jerk black leaders, and
journalists and politicians more interested in political correctness than
solving the problem, we have come to believe the situation is hopeless.

13-year-old arrested 56 times

The situation is not hopeless, if only we have the sense to deal with it
rationally. Every black teenager in Atlanta isn't carrying a pistol to school,
or shooting down customers at the Stop N Go. Most are simply trying to avoid the
ones who are, and would welcome some relief.

In fewer than 12 words, a new account of a police roundup after the killing of
the Englishman in Florida told the story of our stupidity. "The 13-year-old
suspect has a record of 56 arrests." Fifty-six. I thought it must be a
typographical error, but I have seen no correction.

We don't know if the 13-year-old is the killer, or merely caught in the
time-honored police tactic of rounding up the usuals. The mind- boggling part is
that here is a 13-year-old with 56 arrests and still on the street. Stupid.

We aren't listening to Derrel Martin, the Clayton County teacher who works
mostly with poor and/or minority kids: "Our genetic bank hasn't changed in the
last 50 years - kids are kids. They kill each other because we let them and
allow an environment to exist that fosters crime."

Events in Florida not surprising

We aren't listening to Gene Methvin, native of Vienna, Ga., senior editor at
Reader's Digest and a national authority on crime. If we paid attention to
Gene's report earlier this summer, we wouldn't be surprised by the news from
Florida.

Florida has only 300 secure juvenile beds in the entire state. Jacksonville has
data on 161 local criminals, average age 16, who have been arrested 1,900 times
on 2,638 criminal charges; 10 for murder, 123 for robbery, 101 for firearms
charges, 25 for arson, 30 for sex crimes and 337 for assault.

When a serious habitual offender is arrested, Duval County can detain him/her
for only 21 days. Unless a detention slot is available, he/she is sent home to
wait. The offender is usually arrested three or four times while waiting. I
doubt Methvin would find things much different in Georgia.

We are stupid in not telling kids, before they become hardened offenders,
exactly what behavior is wrong and unacceptable. In Georgia, we have a law,
unconstitutional, of course, written with the best of intentions. The law says
that juvenile offenders cannot be publicly identified. Two weeks ago, this
newspaper reported the arrest of a 14- year-old Peachtree City boy for taking a
pistol to school in his book bag. Although he has committed a felony and been
sent to a youth detention facility for evaluation, he can enjoy official
anonymity. Everybody at McIntosh High School knows exactly who he is and
everybody in his neighborhood.

Peachtree City's police chief, obviously a man of good intentions, said he
didn't feel it was newsworthy, or threatening to anyone since the gun was
unloaded and not pointed.

The community also has rights

A child carrying a gun to school is a big thing, a scary thing. Certainly it is
if my child or grandchild attends that school.

The community has rights, too. Our representatives might consider introducing,
and the General Assembly passing, a change in the law protecting juvenile felons
from public exposure. Including the 15-year- old in Newnan admitting ownership
of 68 rocks of cocaine. Kids and parents have got to get the message.

The great majority of Americans - black, white, rich, poor, whatever - are
law-abiding. We are stupid to allow ourselves to be terrorized by a small group.
We are irresponsible not to let our children know that it's unthinkable to carry
a gun to school.

from public exposure. Including the 15-year- old in Newnan admitting ownership
of 68 rocks of cocaine. Kids and parents have got to get the message.

The great majority of Americans - black, white, rich, poor, whatever - are
law-abiding. We are stupid to allow ourselves to be terrorized by a small group.
We are irresponsible not to let our children know that it's unthinkable to carry
a gun to school.

Pats' coach now a legend

Vince Lombardi. Wow.

Pretty holy company, wouldn't you say?

Patriots coach Bill Belichick last Sunday became historically linked to Lombardi
when he tied the man for whom pro football's ultimate prize is named for the
highest playoff winning percentage [9-1, .900] in NFL history.

Lombardi and his winning-is-everything scripture still cast a spell over the NFL
and America's business boardrooms, 35 years after his death at age 57.

Regarding comparisons of Belichick to Lombardi, Belichick humbly stated, "I
think that's stretching it a little bit."

Belichick is right. Other than his knack for winning championships, he is
definitely no Vince Lombardi.

The coaching deity Belichick closely resembles --and whose legend he more
fanatically aspires toward -- is Paul Brown, the true father of modern football,
for whom the Cleveland Browns he coached to 10 consecutive championship games
from 1946 to 1955 [winning seven titles, including three NFL titles] are named.

"Many of the things that we do today, and that I did when I was at Cleveland [as
head coach from 1991-95], are the same things that Paul Brown did," said
Belichick about his coaching hero who died in 1991. "The same schedule, the same
philosophy, the same approach to getting your team to perform to the highest
level on the practice field, in meetings, in strategy, in game situations. The
level that he was at, I think was way ahead of the competition at that point.
And it's very, very much the blueprint for the way the game is played today,
including the West Coast Offense."

Belichick is very much his father's son on the subject of Paul Brown. His
86-year-old father Steve, a former Detroit Lions fullback who coached college
football for 43 years, remains Paul Brown's greatest admirer.

The elder Belichick first met Brown while coaching at Hiram College in Ohio. "We
had a football banquet in Cleveland that Paul Brown was a speaker at, and I
don't know that Paul ever spoke anyplace else," a grateful Steve Belichick once
said.

The West Coast Offense, pro football's trendiest offense of the last 20 years,
is usually traced to Bill Walsh in San Francisco. Rewind further and you will
find Walsh was an assistant coach under Brown with the Cincinnati Bengals. One
of Walsh's offensive assistants in San Francisco was Mike Holmgren. Holmgren
became head coach in Green Bay in 1992 and hired Andy Reid as an assistant coach
and taught him the West Coast offense. Reid took that offense to Philadelphia
when he became the Eagles' head coach in 1999.

It is that offense Belichick's celebrated defense must confront next Sunday in
Super Bowl XXXIX in Jacksonville. Paul Brown's offense.

"It should be the Ohio River Offense," Steve Belichick once said. "Hells bells,
I mean, Paul Brown, his contributions to football are so great. It always
bothered me that the league hasn't honored Paul the way they should."

Lombardi's greatest impact on next Sunday's game will be the silver trophy
handed out to the winner, and that should never be diminished. Belichick's
Patriots share many of the honorable traits of those storied Packers of the
1960s. The highly disciplined football the Packers of Lombardi played was basic
kick-you-in-the-teeth, executed to perfection. The Patriots can resort to that
when necessary.

Lombardi was likewise a highly intelligent man. He was to football psychological
what Belichick is to defense --a genius. His teams were the toughest in league
history. They won five NFL titles in seven years. Belichick's Patriots are after
their third Lombardi Trophy in four years.

Belichick, a voracious reader of books about coaching, told me last season while
I was working on a story about Lombardi, "The big thing about Lombardi was his
preaching of fundamentals. In a complex game like football, where there are a
lot of different skills involved and a lot of different positions, in the end
you have to have a good fundamental base. For him it was blocking and tackling
and a lot of the real fundamentals of the game. He was a real stickler and
stressed those. That's something we can all hang our hat on, whether you coach
the run 'n shoot, the wing-T, the I [formation], or the 4-3 or 3-4 defense.
Fundamental football, that's 90 percent the same no matter what you do."

To many of the Patriots players, "Lombardi" means the trophy for which they
bleed, sweat and strive to raise. Patriots center Dan Koppen joked that he
didn't even get halfway through reading a book about Lombardi.

"You can't say [Lombardi] doesn't mean anything to you, because that would be
very disrespectful of the past," said Koppen. "The past is a big part of this
league and why it is where it is today. Obviously it's a great compliment [for
the Patriots to be compared to the great teams of the past] but a compliment
that really has no bearing on this game."

Washington: ICE Texas field offices remove more than 800 sex offenders so far
this year More than 2,000 removed every year in past three years

LENGTH: 606  words

DATELINE: Washington


U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, The Government of USA has issued the
following news release:

The four Texas field offices within U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's
(ICE) Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) have deported more than 860 sex
offenders so far this fiscal year.

Of the 862 alien sex offenders deported by the Texas-based offices, about 27
percent were convicted of sex offenses against children.

ICE's four Texas field offices are located in Dallas, El Paso, Houston and San
Antonio. The Dallas area of responsibility includes 128 counties in north Texas,
and the state of Oklahoma. Dallas ERO deported 171 sex offenders so far in
fiscal year 2014; 47 were convicted of sex offenses against a minor. In all of
fiscal year 2013, the office deported 463 sex offenders; 154 were convicted of
sex offenses against a minor. In 2013, all four Texas offices deported 2,124 sex
offenders; 508 were convicted of sex offenses against a minor. In fiscal year
2012, Texas ERO offices deported 2,007 sex offenders, and 2,127 in 2011.

ICE officers routinely apprehend removable convicted sex offenders during
targeted enforcement operations, or they are turned over to ICE custody when
local/state jails or prisons release them after they serve their prison
sentences. Additionally, ICE and the Texas Department of Public Safety have
begun to regularly share information on sex offenders. This partnership allows
ICE to cross-reference the list of sex offenders provided from the state to
determine if they are removable aliens.

"Identifying and locating aliens convicted of sex offenses and other serious
crimes are a high priority for our fugitive operations teams," said Thomas P.
Giles, field office director for ERO Dallas. "Ultimately, our efforts to remove
these criminals from our streets, our communities and our country have a
positive impact on public safety."

Some of the more egregious offenses of the criminal alien sex offenders deported
throughout Texas include: sexual assault, kidnapping, and aggravated sexual
assault of a child.

Following are some of the sex offenders deported by officers with the ERO Dallas
office: (In accordance with Department of Homeland Security privacy policies,
ICE cannot include the names of those deported.)

A 34-year-old man from Mexico was arrested by ERO officers in Dallas. In
November 2013, he was convicted in Moore County, Texas, of indecency with a
child by contact. He was deported Dec. 20, 2013.
 A 29-year-old man from Guatemala was arrested by ERO officers Nov. 7 in
Mesquite. In March 2000, he was convicted in Dallas County, Texas, of aggravated
sexual assault of a child, and evading arrest. He was deported Dec. 11, 2013.
 A 55-year-old man from Mexico was arrested by ERO officers Oct. 31 in Fort
Worth. In October 2013, he was convicted of indecency with a child in Tarrant
County, Texas. He was deported Dec. 5, 2013.
 A 20-year-old man from Mexico was arrested by ERO officers Oct. 1 in Lubbock.
In September 2013, he was convicted of aggravated sexual assault in Gaines
County, Texas. He was deported Oct. 2, 2013.

Nationwide, ICE has removed more than 72,000 aliens with criminal convictions so
far this fiscal year. These removals represent the agency's ongoing commitment
to prioritizing the removal of criminal aliens and egregious immigration law
violators.

ICE is focused on smart, effective immigration enforcement that prioritizes the
removal of criminal aliens, recent border crossers and egregious immigration law
violators, such as those who have been previously removed from the United
States.

DOGS' OFFENSE KEEPS IMPROVING

BYLINE: Marc Weiszer Morris News Service

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. C1

LENGTH: 470 words

DATELINE: ATHENS, Ga.


There weren't many encouraging signs for Georgia's offense on the night it
opened the season in the Georgia Dome.

Three months later, the Bulldogs return there for the Southeastern Conference
Championship game with arguably the most prolific offense in coach Mark Richt's
11 seasons.

Georgia ranks in the top four in the SEC in passing offense (second) total
offense (third), scoring offense (fourth) and rushing offense (fourth). Only the
2005 SEC champion Bulldogs finished the season in the top four in those
categories and this year's team has put up better numbers than that squad.

"We usually don't look at any national stats when you play in this league,"
offensive coordinator Mike Bobo said. "You try to get up in the upper half of
our league."

Georgia is averaging 34 points and 180.6 rushing yards per game, the most ever
under Richt. That offense will face a Louisiana State University team that ranks
second in the nation in total and scoring defense.

Quarterback Aaron Murray has thrown 32 touchdown passes, seven more than Matthew
Stafford's previous program record.

"I thought we've improved every week," Bobo said. "I thought we got better in a
lot of areas and just continue to add things, add new wrinkles and expand the
playbook as the guys got older and Aaron got more comfortable."

It started rather rocky against Boise State in a 35-21 loss.

"We had a lot of stuff to work out and smooth out," said redshirt freshman
receiver Michael Bennett, who was "shaking in my shoes" in his first college
game.

Unveiling a no-huddle offense, Georgia had four first downs at halftime and 80
of its 115 rushing yards off a Brandon Boykin touchdown run.

"We were very young," Murray said. "We had a lot of guys at new positions on the
offensive line, some new running backs, young guys at receivers. ... All season
long we've been getting better and better and maturing and I think that's why
you've seen the progress."

Boise State opened a 28-7 third-quarter lead before Georgia hit touchdown passes
of 36 yards to Orson Charles and 51 to Maclolm Mitchell.

"We made some plays," Richt said. "Malcolm Mit-chell made some plays. That was
encouraging. Orson had a pretty big day. That was encouraging. We just didn't
execute down after down after down very well."

Georgia was a miserable

2 of 13 on third downs.

"I wasn't discouraged," Richt said. "I wasn't like, 'Oh, man, we're in trouble.'
"

Georgia doubled its point production in a 45-42 loss to South Carolina the next
week, but was undone by the Gamecocks' defense turning three turnovers into
touchdowns.

"We just went back and challenged our guys that we've got to believe in what
we're doing, we're going to stick with it," Bobo said.

"I feel like we're playing our best football," Bennett said, "and that's a
really good thing to be saying coming into the SEC Championship."

Parity the rule so far in Valley play

BYLINE: By Randy Reinhardt;rreinhardt@pantagraph.com

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. B2

LENGTH: 466 words


Identifying either the top teams or the bottom teams in the Missouri Valley
Football Conference has become all but impossible.

With eight of the nine Valley programs only three games into their league
schedules, there are no undefeated teams and there are no winless squads.

Western Illinois, which did not win a Valley game in 2009, leads the league
along with Southern Illinois and Northern Iowa at 2-1.

The trio at .500 is Illinois State (2-2), Indiana State (1-1) and Missouri State
(1-1). Tied for last but only one game out of first are North Dakota State,
Youngstown State and South Dakota State at 1-2.

"I don't think any coach would predict how games are going to come out this
Saturday," Western coach Mark Hendrickson said, "or the rest of the weekends."

Offenses thriving Five Valley teams are averaging more than 32 points with
Missouri State leading the way at 38.0.

"I thought it would be a little more of a defensive grind," said first-year
Youngstown State coach Eric Wolford. "The offenses have performed pretty well.
There is a lot of creativity on offense right now. Offenses are making you
defend the whole field."

"The whole atmosphere around offensive football has changed. Anything goes,"
Southern Illinois coach Dale Lennon said. "It's a much more wide-open game. The
rules are a little more friendly toward the offense."

Northern Iowa coach Mark Farley agrees recent rules changes such as moving
kickoffs back to the 30-yard line have aided offenses.

"There have been rules to protect the offense and create big plays," said
Farley. "It makes it fun to watch as a spectator. But as a defensive coach, I
would like some rules back."

How many yards? Missouri State surrendered a whopping 816 yards of total offense
in a 72-59 loss to Murray State last week. It was the most combined points in a
Bears' game since 1912.

"We couldn't have played much better offensively," said Missouri State coach
Terry Allen, whose team totaled 607 yards. "We're not that good offensively, and
we're not that bad defensively. Confidence is an issue, especially for our
defense."

Jacks hit the win column South Dakota State claimed its first win with a 33-29
victory over Western Illinois last Saturday after opening with four losses.

"There is a whole different heartbeat in our program right now," Jackrabbits'
coach John Stiegelmeier said. "We feel like a better football team."

First MVFC webcast The Valley, in partnership with Webstream Productions, will
air its first webcast Saturday.

The 3 p.m. Missouri State at Indiana State game will be available free on
streaming video at valley-football.org.

THE APRIL DALY KIDNAPPING 'He tried to strangle her,' mom asserts Victim is back
home, badly shaken but unharmed

Allen Mobley tried to shoot April Daly in a Chattanooga motel room Wednesday,
but when the gun didn't fire, he tried to strangle her, Ms. Daly's mother said
Thursday.

That incident and the panicked reaction of Ms. Daly, a 19-year-old theater ni
ght manager, was the turning point in her 72-hour, three-state ordeal, said her
mother, Adrienne Vickery.

"The emotional stress and shock my daughter is in and with the attempted rape,
the strangulation, dehydration, it's been horrible," said Mrs. Vickery. "She
said she screamed and she screamed and she screamed, because she knew there were
people next door, but they didn't come."

"She's pretty scarred up - strangulation marks on her neck. He tried to strangle
her," Mrs. Vickery said. "She's got a rash on her face from crying and screaming
as she tried to get away from him."

Mrs. Vickery said the screaming apparently frightened Mr. Mobley, a 19-year-old
former classmate of her daughter's who held the young woman captive from the
early morning hours Monday until 1:30 a.m. Thursday, when he rammed a police
barricade and flipped her blue Chevrolet.

In those four days, Mr. Mobley allegedly forced Ms. Daly on an odyssey that took
them from Florida to Knoxville, Tenn., and back as police and FBI tracked them
through phone calls and automated teller machine withdrawals.

Ms. Daly had eaten only once - at a Burger King - and then not very much.
Doctors wanted her to stay in the hospital, but she preferred to go home. Ms.
Daly is taking medication for minor back pain and emotional stress, Mrs. Vickery
said.

By Thursday evening, Ms. Daly lay in bed, holding her boyfriend's hand and in
her other hand, a popisicle that her brother and sister brought from an ice
cream truck.

"I'm really happy to be home with my family," she said. "Thanks to all the
police and FBI agents, neighbors, family and friends. This is like a dream to be
home, a good dream."

Of her ordeal, Ms. Daly would only say she tried to calmly talk to Mr. Mobley .

Bond now set at $ 200,000

Mr. Mobley is in the Gwinnett County Jail in lieu of a bond increased from $
73,500 to $ 200,000. He is charged with felony kidnapping, three counts of false
imprisonment and three misdemeanor counts of pointing a pistol at another,
aggravated assault on a police officer, burglary, and possessing a firearm
during the commission of a crime. A preliminary hearing is set for early next
week.

Mrs. Vickery said Thursday that Mr. Mobley tried to kill and rape her daughter
and she was angry that he was not charged with those crimes.

"We'll investigate any claims she brings forth, but for now we have not been
made aware of them," responded Gwinnett District Attorney Daniel Porter.

Ms. Daly's harrowing trip back to Lilburn began about 7 p.m. Wednesday night
with a phone call to her family from Chattanooga, saying she was on her way
home, Mrs. Vickery said.

"She was upset on the phone, she was crying and Allen got on the phone and he
said, 'I'm bringing her home,' " Mrs. Vickery said. "Then he said, 'I've got a
gun. I've got bullets. But the gun doesn't work.' "

A five-hour wait

To convince Mr. Mobley to bring her back, Ms. Daly had to promise Mr. Mobley
there would be no police or FBI at her family's house in Lilburn. Twenty minutes
after the first call, Mr. Mobley called again for reassurance that he would not
be pulled over by police.

The Vickerys' neighborhood was blanketed with FBI agents; agents were cruising
the highways and police throughout the state and region were on the lookout for
the pair.

Five hours later Mr. Mobley and Ms. Daly were spotted by FBI agents on
Interstate 75. Police and federal agents following the two in unmarked cars lost
them when Mr. Mobley went west on I-285 instead of east, Mrs. Vickery said, but
police resumed contact and tracked them to I-85 and Indian Trail Road.

"When he felt he was spotted he started flipping out and tried to get away,"
Mrs. Vickery said. "He was running several red lights and that was when the FBI
said move in quick."

"He made a reference that, 'This is it, we're both going to go' - that he was
just going to end it," she said. "He accelerated so fast he ran into the road
block they set up, crashing into two police cars, the car flipped completely
over."

At first, Mr. Mobley said he wanted to kill himself in front of Ms. Daly, Mrs.
Vickery said her daughter told her. "Then he changed his plans."

Until he tried to shoot Ms. Daly Wednesday evening, Mr. Mobley and Ms. Daly both
thought the gun worked, her mother said. He reportedly got the gun through a
friend.

Mr. Mobley, according to the Vickerys and friends of his, was a spurned suitor.
He allegedly broke into the Green's Corner United Artists Theater on Jimmy
Carter Boulevard where she worked Sunday night, held Ms. Daly and three others
captive until he forced her into her 1988 Chevrolet Spectrum and went north on
I-85.

Mr. Mobley's family said this week he is a manic-depressive who had stopped
taking his medication and that he may have been taking illegal drugs. Thursday
morning, after he was released from DeKalb Medical Center into police custody,
Mr. Mobley tried to drown himself in a toilet bowl, Sheriff Jim Carsten said.

"I felt a little bit of compassion for Allen because of his mental problem. Now
all I feel is total anger, nothing but total anger to do this to my daughter,"
Mrs. Vickery said. "I had compassion yesterday, but I have none whatsoever
today. My husband has nothing but anger against him."

Ms. Daly's stepfather, Arthur Jim Vickery said, "Allen tried to kill my
daughter, . . . and if there is any justice in this country, he will be
punished." The Vickerys were dismayed that Mr. Mobley's bond was set at $
200,000.

James H. Lewis of Douglasville, a friend of the Mobley family, will defend him.

Kyle Shanahan's offense borrows from his mentors but is entirely his own

SECTION: SPORTS

LENGTH: 889 words


HOUSTON - The high-powered offence of the Atlanta Falcons has gotten them to the
Super Bowl. It has landed a head coaching job in San Francisco for offensive
co-ordinator Kyle Shanahan. It could yield a league MVP award for quarterback
Matt Ryan.

It all has worked not only because of the on-field brilliance of Ryan and wide
receiver Julio Jones, but also because of the offensive scheme taken to Atlanta
by Shanahan. That system is a blend of the versions of the West Coast offence
learned by Shanahan from some of his coaching mentors - and his own father, Mike
- with significant wrinkles added by Shanahan.

"You see Gary's offence in it," former Washington Redskins quarterback Joe
Theismann said. "You see Mike's offence in it. Every guy takes parts from the
guys he has worked with. What you see is an offence that has been developed over
time and adapted to Kyle's personality and the personnel that he has."

Mike Shanahan's offences generally blended a traditional West Coast passing game
- the quick-hitting, stretch-the-defence-horizontally approach popularized by
the Bill Walsh-coached 49ers during their glory days - with a running game
utilizing zone blocking by the offensive line and "stretch" plays. That system
produced two Super Bowl triumphs for the Denver Broncos.

Kubiak, a Mike Shanahan coaching protégé who was Kyle Shanahan's boss in Houston
before winning last season's Super Bowl with the Broncos, was particularly
enamoured with putting his quarterback on the move with rollouts and bootlegs.

When Mike Shanahan coached the Redskins and Kyle was the team's offensive
co-ordinator, they added college-style elements to their offence - the pistol
formation and option-style running plays - for the rookie season of quarterback
Robert Griffin III in 2012.

Yet both Shanahans say that Kyle's current offence with the Falcons is
meaningfully different from what Mike Shanahan-coached teams traditionally did.

"Outside zone in running game is the same as before except for wider landmarks,"
Mike Shanahan said via text message. "QB keeps or bootlegs are the same as
before except for more variations. Everything else is different: drop-back
attack concepts, play-action concepts between the tackles, formation variations
and personnel groupings within a game plan, audible system, third-down attack,
red zone attack and two-minute offence."

Kyle Shanahan echoed those sentiments this week in Houston.

"I think we've all grown from different places," he said. "I think the one thing
we all have in common is that the basis, the percentage of our runs are outside
zone. And we do some [quarterback] bootlegs or keepers, whatever you want to
call them, off of that. After that, that's about it.

"When I got to Houston, it was my first time working for Kub. I had spent all
the time with Jon Gruden [as a Tampa Bay Buccaneers assistant] before that. So
we saw offence totally different. We meshed a little bit first time together.
When I went to Washington, that was my first time working with my dad. I thought
we saw football similar. But we quickly realized after a few weeks that we
thought differently. We grew together. He gave me a lot of leeway while I was
there. It was fun to try a bunch of different things, having to even incorporate
the zone read and stuff when we got Robert. But it's always growing."

The Falcons' passing game is not your father's - or, more precisely, Shanahan's
father's - West Coast passing game.

"There's a genesis to it," Theismann said this week. "It has been morphed and
expanded. People put their own personalities into it. The basic principles of
the West Coast offence are that you're going to get the ball out of the
quarterback's hand quickly and you're going to focus on getting yards after the
catch. You're going to use screens. You're going to get the ball into the hands
of the running back and treat those throws almost like running plays."

There is a vertical, down-the-field aspect to the Falcons' offence focused on
making certain that Jones gets his opportunities to make big plays.

"Kyle had Andre Johnson in Houston," Theismann said. "He had Pierre Garcon in
Washington. He has Julio Jones in Atlanta. He's got his guy and he likes to
mould the offence around that. Kyle finds a guy that he concentrates on, and
that's the guy that the offence goes through ... There are vertical aspects to
it. The West Coast offence traditionally was not about 'go' routes and fades. It
was posts and corners. I got into it once with Dwight Clark. I said, 'Joe
Montana can't throw a fade.' Dwight said, 'How many rings does he have?'"

The Falcons have a chance Sunday to win a Super Bowl title. But if they do
manage to upset the New England Patriots, it won't necessarily be another
championship for the offence of Walsh, Gruden, Mike Shanahan, Kubiak and others.
It will be a title for Kyle Shanahan's offence.

"We all originate from the same thing," Kyle Shanahan said. "If you go all the
way back to like, 'What's a West Coast offence?' - we use some of that
terminology. So that's why I think people would say some of this is West Coast.
But everybody's offence is different. And when you go different places, unless
you're just running a playbook, it always changes. And ours has changed every
year. It was different from the beginning. And it's grown a lot different over
the years."

First-string players will gain much playing time

BYLINE: By Jim Thomas ST. LOUIS POST-DISPATCH

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. D1

LENGTH: 603 words


Very much a traditionalist in terms of the preseason, Rams coach Scott Linehan
is treating exhibition game No. 3 tonight in Oakland, Calif., as the big dress
rehearsal for the regular season.

For the most part, Rams starters will play the entire first half, and perhaps
even into the third quarter. With many of the starters expected to sit out next
week's exhibition finale against Kansas City, this will be the last chance to
polish up for the real games. Based on what transpired last week against San
Diego, there is plenty that needs polishing.

For one, the starting offense has yet to score a touchdown in the preseason. For
another, the coverage units on special teams sprang some major leaks against the
Chargers. And lastly, the defense has yet to come up with a turnover in
exhibition play, while also missing some tackles on run defense.

Linehan has grown weary of being asked about the offense, or lack thereof, this
preseason.

"Last year, you (reporters) were all on my case about our red-zone offense, and
that we weren't ever going to score a touchdown in the whole season," Linehan
said.

After a slow start, the Rams finished sixth in the NFL in total offense, and
were among the league leaders in red-zone offense.

The Rams' first-team offense, even with very little playing time for feature
back Steven Jackson, has moved the ball fairly well this preseason. Only one of
five possessions by the starting offense has resulted in a three-and-out series.

On the other four series, the Rams advanced the ball into enemy territory each
time. But three of those drives were scuttled by turnovers.

There is no panic, quarterback Marc Bulger said. "But it is frustrating. You
work really hard for this long, and you're not showing the fans and everyone
what you're capable of.

"But I think when the time's right, we'll start scoring, and hopefully it starts
(against Oakland)."

On special teams, the Rams followed a very good night for the coverage units in
Minnesota with subpar work against San Diego. The worst moment was the 81-yard
punt return for a touchdown by Darren Sproles.

Part of the problem on that play, Linehan said, was that the Rams got out of
their coverage lanes. But he also said several players slowed or even stopped on
contact - bad habits left from the 2006 season.

As a result, the middle of the field was wide open for Sproles; safety
Oshiomogho "O.J." Atogwe seemed to be the only Rams player with even a decent
chance to make the tackle.

"The guy (Sproles) had probably a little bit more room than you'd like once he
had the ball in his hands," Linehan said. "So we have to get off blocks, break
down, and get the guy on the ground. We don't necessarily try to hit a moving
target like that with one punch; you're going to have to try to get more guys
around the returner than that."

As for the defense, its overall play hasn't been bad this preseason. In fact,
defensive coordinator Jim Haslett's unit allowed an average of only 236.5 yards
per game against Minnesota and San Diego. But a unit that prided itself on
takeaways a year ago has yet to produce a turnover.

"We haven't even come close right now to getting one in these first two games,"
Haslett said. "Guys are trying to get the ball out. ... We just haven't gotten
any. So that's one area we've got to work. We've got to keep working on the
tackling and the little things. But I'm encouraged. I like what I see so far."

Chiefs' offense should be familiar to Montana

BYLINE: Jarrett Bell

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 3C

LENGTH: 334 words


Joe Montana, trumpeted as the missing link in the Kansas City Chiefs' Super Bowl
drive, is in new territory.

"I have no idea what it all entails," Montana said during a news conference
Wednesday in Santa Clara, Calif.

"I'm sure it'll be difficult initially, but I feel one of the best opportunities
is for me to be there."

The Chiefs' offense ranked 25th in the NFL in 1992. The right side of an
offensive line that allowed 48 sacks in '92 is unsettled. The receivers pale in
comparison to the 49ers' Jerry Rice, John Taylor and Brent Jones.

Yet a big-play defense led by Derrick Thomas and Neil Smith takes pressure off
the offense. And the move makes even more sense for Montana because new Chiefs
offensive coordinator Paul Hackett is installing a San Francisco-type offense.

"He doesn't have to learn a new offense," Hackett, a former 49ers assistant said
Wednesday. "That's a bonus."

Hackett has been busy teaching an offense much different from the Chiefs' old
vertical scheme, which was heavy on power running. Straight out of Bill Walsh
101, the Chiefs' new scheme will have shorter drops, quicker releases, new
blocking schemes, higher-percentage passes - and now, Montana.

"Obviously, much of it is what I learned from Bill," said Hackett. "Of course,
Joe was the guy to take the offense to the next level. So having him here is
going to speed up everybody's learning process, to understand what I'm trying to
do."

Matt Blundin, the second-round pick from Virginia last year, should benefit from
Montana's experience.

The key question for Montana, whom 49ers tight end Jamie Williams says has
sparkled in recent workouts, is how his surgically repaired elbow will hold up.

Montana, 37, has played just one half the last two seasons. But since joining
the 49ers' practice squad last November, he has had no setbacks with the arm.

"We have to be cautious," said Hackett, "but if it all works out, he'll
definitely be able to make the contribution he was looking to make."

Pac-12 football notebook: Pac-12 s high-flying offenses ready for season

BYLINE: Thuc Nhi Nguyen

SECTION: SPORTS

LENGTH: 462 words


Whether its air raid, bear raid, or power, putting a label on the offensive
identity of the Pac-12 Conference doesn t come easily. But there s one
guarantee: It s effective.

The Pac-12 had some of the most explosive offenses in the nation last season
compared to the other BCS conferences. With 10 of 12 teams returning their
starting quarterbacks this year, offenses in the West should flourish even more.
But the style in which each Pac-12 team finds success on the scoreboard is
varied, adding to a dynamic, but diverse, set of offenses in the conference.

This league is a little unusual because there are so many different styles of
play in this league,  Cal coach Sonny Dykes said Wednesday at Pac-12 media day,
and there is a lot of teams that are really committed to doing something a
certain way and they re very good at it.

Oregon is known for a spread offense geared toward its running attack, while
Washington State spreads the field to go to the air. Somewhere in the middle,
Arizona works to balance its offense, while Stanford hasn t bought in to the
trendy up-tempo scheme and sticks to a power running game.

On average, Pac-12 teams score 33.2 points and rack up 445.2 yards per game.

With skill position players that Arizona coach Rich Rodriguez called  second to
none,  offenses in the Pac-12 are multi-headed monsters. Rodriguez emphasized
that with more seven-on-seven passing leagues popping up all over the West
Coast, especially in California where the weather permits outdoor football all
year, athletes at the skill positions are more ready out of high school than
ever.

Oregon on top

Oregon is the favorite to take home the Pac-12 title this season, as the media
voted for the Ducks over UCLA in the conference championship game. This is the
fourth time in five years that Oregon was picked to win the title.

Both the Ducks and the Bruins had 37 first-place votes in their respective
divisions, while Oregon had 24 votes to UCLA s 13 in the championship game.
Stanford and USC each got one vote in the championship game.

After winning the conference championship for two straight years, Stanford
finished second in the North Division in the media poll with two first-place
votes. USC and Arizona State both had one first-place vote in the South
Division. Arizona, Utah and Colorado rounded out the south, while Washington,
Oregon State, Washington State and Cal finished the north s rankings.

DirecTV standstill

The news on the Pac-12 s grudge match with DirecTV is that there is no news.
Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott did not mention the standoff during his
30-minute podium session, and did not take questions at the time. But he said
afterward that it s  unlikely  that the two sides will reach a deal and there
has been little progress in negotiations.

NFL TRAINING CAMP CAPSULES

BYLINE: Compiled by Jamey Eisenberg

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 10B

LENGTH: 833 words


NFC East

Philadelphia Eagles

Last season: 13-3, NFC Champions, lost in Super Bowl

Open camp: Aug. 1, Bethlehem, Pa.

What to watch: The status of wide receiver Terrell Owens is unclear. How much of
a distraction he will be because of his contract demands remains to be seen.

New York Giants

Last season: 6-10

Open camp: Thursday, Albany, N.Y.

What to watch: The offense could be better if Eli Manning develops and can work
with newly signed receiver Plaxico Burress. The defense needs to make progress,
and the return of end Michael Strahan from a torn chest muscle should help.

Dallas Cowboys

Last season: 6-10

Open camp: Thursday, Oxnard, Calif.

What to watch: Drew Bledsoe replaces Vinny Testaverde at quarterback, but is
that an upgrade? The Cowboys need to go back to playing stout defense and
running the ball with Julius Jones. It could be another long season in Dallas
unless Bill Parcells works his magic again.

Washington Redskins

Last season: 6-10

Open camp: July 31, Ashburn, Va.

What to watch: Joe Gibbs has had plenty of off-season problems. Linebacker LaVar
Arrington is upset with Gibbs, safety Sean Taylor was arrested on a felony
charge and the offense, which ranked 30th in the league last year, is still in
disarray. Rookie Jason Campbell should challenge Patrick Ramsey at quarterback.

NFC South

Atlanta Falcons

Last season: 11-5, won division, lost NFC Championship game

Open camp: Monday, Flowery Branch, Ga.

What to watch: Quarterback Michael Vick will look to keep improving in the West
Coast offense, and he gets help from the league's No. 1 rushing attack of
Warrick Dunn and T.J. Duckett. The defense needs help in the secondary, but
linebacker Keith Brooking leads a solid unit.

New Orleans Saints

Last season: 8-8

Open camp: Friday, Metairie, La.

What to watch: The Saints almost made the playoffs last year after starting 4-8.
Quarterback Aaron Brooks, running back Deuce McAllister and wide receivers Joe
Horn and Donte Stallworth lead the offense, while the defense is hoping to pick
up where it left off last year.

Carolina Panthers

Last season: 7-9

Open camp: Friday, Spartanburg, S.C.

What to watch: A healthy Steven Davis at running back. First-round draft pick
Thomas Davis likely will play linebacker because Mark Fields will miss the
season with Hodgkin's Disease.

Tampa Bay Buccaneers

Last season: 5-11

Open camp: Thursday, Lake Buena Vista

What to watch: The Bucs are hoping for an improved offense with the addition of
rookie running back Carnell Williams. Tampa Bay needs to get back to playing
stellar defense and Jon Gruden's high-powered offense finally plays well with
Brian Griese at quarterback.

NFC North

Green Bay Packers

Last season: 10-6, won division, lost in first round

Open camp: Wednesday, Green Bay

What to watch: The Packers' defense actually could improve this year with new
coordinator Jim Bates while the offense struggles. Wide receiver Javon Walker's
holdout could last well into the regular season.

Minnesota Vikings

Last season: 8-8, wild card, lost in divisional playoffs

Open camp: Friday, Mankato, Minn.

What to watch: Daunte Culpepper and the offense shouldn't suffer too much,
especially with the expectations for rookie wide receiver Troy Williamson. The
defense should be improved with several new additions.

Detroit Lions

Last season: 6-10

Open camp: Thursday, Allen Park, Mich.

What to watch: Quarterback Joey Harrington must show he deserves to start ahead
of Jeff Garcia. The secondary should be better with defensive backs Kenoy
Kennedy and R.W. McQuarters.

Chicago Bears

Last season: 5-11

Opened camp: Saturday, Bourbonnais, Ill.

What to watch: The Bears could be a surprise this year if QB Rex Grossman stays
healthy and with the additions of receiver Muhsin Muhammad and running back
Cedric Benson. The defense is young and promising but four starters, including
linebacker Brian Urlacher, were slowed by injuries last season.

NFC West

Seattle Seahawks

Last season: 9-7, won division, lost in first round

Open camp: Thursday, Cheney, Wash. What to watch: The Seahawks need to establish
continuity on defense with at least three new starters. Offense should be solid
again, but only if running back Shaun Alexander doesn't have an extended
holdout.

St. Louis Rams

Last season: 8-8, wild card, lost in divisional playoffs

Open camp: Thursday, St. Louis

What to watch: Steven Jackson will replace Marshall Faulk as the starting
running back. The defensive line, which includes former first-round picks Ryan
Pickett, Jimmy Kennedy and Damione Lewis, has struggled.

Arizona Cardinals

Last season: 6-10

Open camp: July 31, Flagstaff, Ariz.

What to watch: The Cardinals actually could contend in the NFC West if new
quarterback Kurt Warner stays off the ground and rookie cornerback Antrel Rolle
helps the defense.

San Francisco 49ers

Last season: 2-14

Open camp: Thursday, Santa Clara, Calif.

What to watch: Rookie quarterback Alex Smith, this year's first overall pick,
might not start right away. New coach Mike Nolan is hoping to turn around the
once-proud franchise from its recent misery.

varied, adding to a dynamic, but diverse, set of offenses in the conference.

This league is a little unusual because there are so many different styles of
play in this league,  Cal coach Sonny Dykes said Wednesday at Pac-12 media day,
and there is a lot of teams that are really committed to doing something a
certain way and they re very good at it.

Oregon is known for a spread offense geared toward its running attack, while
Washington State spreads the field to go to the air. Somewhere in the middle,
Arizona works to balance its offense, while Stanford hasn t bought in to the
trendy up-tempo scheme and sticks to a power running game.

On average, Pac-12 teams score 33.2 points and rack up 445.2 yards per game.

With skill position players that Arizona coach Rich Rodriguez called  second to
none,  offenses in the Pac-12 are multi-headed monsters. Rodriguez emphasized
that with more seven-on-seven passing leagues popping up all over the West
Coast, especially in California where the weather permits outdoor football all
year, athletes at the skill positions are more ready out of high school than
ever.

Oregon on top

Oregon is the favorite to take home the Pac-12 title this season, as the media
voted for the Ducks over UCLA in the conference championship game. This is the
fourth time in five years that Oregon was picked to win the title.

Both the Ducks and the Bruins had 37 first-place votes in their respective
divisions, while Oregon had 24 votes to UCLA s 13 in the championship game.
Stanford and USC each got one vote in the championship game.

After winning the conference championship for two straight years, Stanford
finished second in the North Division in the media poll with two first-place
votes. USC and Arizona State both had one first-place vote in the South
Division. Arizona, Utah and Colorado rounded out the south, while Washington,
Oregon State, Washington State and Cal finished the north s rankings.

DirecTV standstill

The news on the Pac-12 s grudge match with DirecTV is that there is no news.
Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott did not mention the standoff during his
30-minute podium session, and did not take questions at the time. But he said
afterward that it s  unlikely  that the two sides will reach a deal and there
has been little progress in negotiations.

Boilermakers offense wears out scoreboards;
Purdue has Big Ten's top offense, but hasn't faced a defense like dominant Ohio
State.

BYLINE: By Kyle Nagel Staff Writer

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. B1

LENGTH: 450 words


Like many people who pay attention to college football, Ohio State linebacker
Marcus Freeman is well aware of Purdue's powers on offense.

"Oh, yeah," Freeman said. "We get a lot of the stats."

Try these: 45.4 points per game (1st in the Big Ten and 8th nationally), 309.8
passing yards per game (1st, 14th) and 495.8 total yards per game (1st, 10th).

The fourth-ranked Buckeyes will see that successful offense up close Saturday
night when they travel to face No. 23 Purdue. It is trumpeted as a matchup
between the Big Ten's top offensive and defensive teams.

Purdue's offense starts with quarterback Curtis Painter, who leads the Big Ten
in passing. In five games, the senior from Vincennes, Ind., has completed 67
percent of his passes for 1,542 yards and 18 touchdowns while following a line
of successful signal-callers that includes Drew Brees and Kyle Orton.

"Painter obviously has got great command of what they do," OSU coach Jim Tressel
said. "Tremendously quick release, great touch when he needs it, and he'll kill
you with the run when they need it."

But they haven't needed it much. While beating Toledo, I-AA Eastern Illinois,
Central Michigan, Minnesota and Notre Dame (combined record 7-18), Purdue has
defeated opponents by an average of 25 points per game.

With so many passes flying around (six different Purdue players have
double-digit catches), Painter often plays judge and jury to a group of hungry
receivers in the huddle.

"That happens a lot," said junior receiver Greg Orton, the former Wayne High
star who has 18 catches for 233 yards, third-best on the team in both
categories. "He gets it a lot in practice. But sometimes we'll look at the film
and I have to admit, 'OK, maybe I wasn't that open.' "

They're still asking, though.

"You have to pick and choose who you listen to," Painter said, "and when you
listen to them."

There haven't been many pressure points. The Boilermakers have outscored
opponents 137-20 in the first half this season with halftime leads of 14, 28,
31, 21 and 23 points. That margin shrinks in the second half (90-82), but by
then the games have been well in hand.

That also means the offensive numbers could be better (or worse, if you're an
opponent). Especially with a roster full of confident players that has piled up
massive yards, the Boilermakers will face a different challenge against an Ohio
State defense that has allowed 197.6 yards per game, best in the Big Ten and
second nationally.

"I think I've made my case that if (the ball) comes to my side, I can do
something with it," Orton said. "A lot of our offensive players can."

FROM THE GEORGIA TECH LOCKER ROOM;
Roof works on slowing Ole Miss' spread offense

BYLINE: Ken Sugiura; Staff

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 4C

LENGTH: 581 words


The Ole Miss offense limped to the finish of the regular season, scoring 20
points in its final two games.

That's not the offense Georgia Tech defensive coordinator Ted Roof is preparing
to see Dec. 30 in the Music City Bowl in Nashville, Tenn.

"I think they're very, very talented," Roof said Wednesday. "They go fast and
run the ball. They try and catch you making mistakes by not getting lined up or
missed fits."

Ole Miss employs a high-tempo spread offense that averaged the most plays per
game, 77.8, in the SEC. By comparison, Tech ran 70.8 plays despite holding the
ball 33:50 per game to Ole Miss' 29:29. Tech has seen similar schemes this
season. North Carolina and Clemson also run fast-paced spread offenses.

The most dangerous player might be running back Jeff Scott, who averages 7.4
yards per carry. The Rebels start three wide receivers, all of whom average at
least 3.7 receptions. Laquon Treadwell (5.6 catches) was rated the nation's No.
1 receiving prospect in 2013, part of Ole Miss' top 10 signing class.

The spread and the team speed "forces you to make one-on-one tackles because
they force you to defend the entire width of the field," Roof said.

With more preparation time than for a regular-season opponent, Roof is taking
longer to teach the game plan than usual. He said he might work on the nickel
blitzes one practice, third downs another day and short-yardage situations on a
third day.

"I like to do it in bits and pieces so there's something there for them mentally
every day, so it's not the same-old, same-old every day," he said.

All-star games: Safety Jemea Thomas received an invitation to play in the
East-West Shrine Game on Jan. 18 in St. Petersburg, Fla. It's a pre-draft
all-star game whose main purpose is to provide a showcase for NFL scouts.

Defensive end Emmanuel Dieke, A-back Robert Godhigh and offensive lineman Will
Jackson accepted invitations to the College All-Star Bowl, which will be played
Feb. 14 in Greenville, S.C. Center Jay Finch and B-back David Sims have also
been invited to participate.

Defensive tackle Euclid Cummings committed to play in the Medal of Honor Bowl, a
first-year game being held in Charleston, S.C., on Jan. 11. The head coaches in
that game are former Tech coach Chan Gailey and former Tech offensive
coordinator Ralph Friedgen.

In November, defensive end Jeremiah Attaochu accepted an invitation to the
Senior Bowl.

Local publicity: Tech will hold its one practice in Nashville at Father Ryan
High School. Coach Paul Johnson sees the team's stay in Nashville as a positive
for recruiting.

"We recruit the private school league there, or try to," Johnson said. "So
anytime you can gain exposure in a market, it's good."

Tech has two Tennessee players on the roster, Jackson (Knoxville) and offensive
lineman Shaquille Mason (Columbia).

Injury report: Offensive tackles Chase Roberts (concussion) and Morgan Bailey
(undisclosed) are out for the bowl game. Middle linebacker Daniel Drummond
(lower leg) is "questionable to probable," Johnson said.

Johnson said he will talk after the bowl game with Bailey, who has been
effective when healthy but able to play only 15 of a possible 39 games because
of injury, about whether he'll return next season. Bailey is scheduled to
graduate in the spring. It is not uncommon for players to forego their final
year of eligibility if they have graduated but do not expect much playing time.

Redskins' Air Apparent; Turner's Wide-Open Offense Is Hybrid

Mark Maske, Washington Post Staff Writer

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. D01

LENGTH: 1265 words


The family tree for offensive coaching wizardry in the modern-day NFL usually
begins with Bill Walsh and the San Francisco 49ers and branches outward. And
once again this season, it is a West Coast offense that is shredding defenses
throughout the league.

But it is not the West Coast offense that is all the rage in the early stages of
the 1999 season. It is not Walsh's offense. It is Don Coryell's offense, as
implemented by Redskins Coach Norv Turner, Ernie Zampese and Mike Martz.

The NFL's highest-rated passers this season are, in order, the St. Louis Rams'
Kurt Warner, the Redskins' Brad Johnson and the New England Patriots' Drew
Bledsoe. Those three teams also have three of the league's five highest-ranked
offenses. The Redskins are second, the undefeated Rams are third and the
Patriots are fifth.

And, thanks to Turner and offensive coordinators Zampese of the Patriots and
Martz of the Rams, all three clubs run basically the same offense--the offense
run by Coryell when he coached the pass-happy San Diego Chargers of Dan Fouts,
Charlie Joiner, Kellen Winslow and Co. in the late 1970s and '80s. It also is
basically the same offense Joe Gibbs used with the Redskins to win three Super
Bowl titles with three different quarterbacks in the '80s and early '90s.

"Everybody has changed it a little bit through the years to fit their
personnel," Zampese said yesterday. "Everybody has a little different something,
but the basics are still intact from Don Coryell. It's all the same, really."

Even when the Redskins were en route to an 0-7 start last season, Turner stood
firm behind his system and declared: "What we do works." Now they're 3-1 and
tied for first place in the NFC East, and it's clear that his offensive system
is part of the reason.

"It gives you a lot of different people to go to," said Johnson, who has been
named the NFC offensive player of the week twice in his first four games with
the Redskins. "It's very high percentage, if you have the weapons. I've seen a
lot of offenses that don't take chances and are supposed to be high percentage.
This one has both."

Martz, the Redskins' quarterbacks coach the previous two seasons before joining
Coach Dick Vermeil's staff in St. Louis this year, said this week: "It's a
quarterback-friendly offense. It allows the quarterback to get the ball out
quickly."

It is not a clone of Walsh's famed West Coast offense. That system features
three-step drops by the quarterback and plenty of quick throws to receivers on
short patterns in the hope they can get loose for long runs after the catch. The
Coryell passing attack also gets the ball to receivers on the run in seams of
the defense. But it has more five-step drops by the quarterback and longer
throws down the field.

"This is quick to get the ball out, but San Francisco was even quicker," Zampese
said. "Bill figured you could throw a short pass and have a guy run a long way
with it. This is designed to push the ball up the field more."

Turner said this week: "I think the basic philosophy of the system is a timing
passing game. When teams allow you to--and we've been getting more coverages
where we've been able to do it--you're able to get the ball to receivers on
timing routes, on the run in seams. . . . The greatest thing about the system
is, when you're going good, you're spreading the ball around to all five
receivers."

Each of the Redskins' starting wide receivers, Michael Westbrook and Albert
Connell, is averaging more than 20 yards per reception this season. Westbrook is
on pace for an 84-catch season, and Connell is on course for 72 receptions.
Fullback Larry Centers is on a 60-catch pace, tight end Stephen Alexander is on
a 44-catch pace, and the Redskins haven't even utilized number three wideout
Irving Fryar or third-down running back Brian Mitchell extensively.

Turner, Zampese and Martz all say an offensive player could be traded from one
of their three clubs to another on a Monday and be ready to play for his new
team the following Sunday. Each has added his own wrinkles to the offense
--Martz, for example, is using four-wide-receiver packages with the Rams this
season--but the plays and the terminology used to call them are basically the
same. When the Patriots signed veteran running back Terry Allen, who was
released by the Redskins during the offseason, the transition for him was
minimal.

"He had no problem picking it right up," Zampese said.

Johnson was among the league's most valuable players in the first quarter of the
season, yet Turner spent the Redskins' bye week getting the quarterback familiar
with some of the aspects of the team's playbook that hadn't been introduced to
him yet. Turner's offense features many formations and players in motion and has
incorporated the power running game he learned under John Robinson at the
University of Southern California.

Turner has spent time with Coryell, but the two never have been particularly
close. Turner's ties to the Coryell system mostly came through Fouts, Turner's
college teammate at Oregon, and two of the Chargers' offensive coordinators
under Coryell, Gibbs and Zampese.

Turner was an assistant coach at USC when Coryell became the Chargers' head
coach in 1978, and he had spent time watching Fouts run the "Air Coryell"
offense on the practice field and sitting in on some of San Diego's coaches'
meetings. Turner and Robinson were together again, this time with the Los
Angeles Rams, when Robinson hired Zampese as offensive coordinator in 1987. The
Rams' offense became a blend of the Coryell passing game and the old USC running
game, and that remains the foundation of Turner's offense to this day.

He took the system with him to Dallas when he became the Cowboys' offensive
coordinator in 1991, and brought it to Washington when he became the Redskins'
head coach in '94. After altering the offense's terminology when he was with the
Cowboys, Turner switched back in Washington to make things more comfortable for
Gibbs's old offensive line coach, Jim Hanifan.

"When I left the Rams and went to Dallas, we put the offense in exactly in the
form we ran in L.A., and then we added some things that fit [wide receivers]
Michael Irvin and Alvin Harper and that fit [fullback] Daryl Johnston," Turner
said. "And then you keep expanding. I'll pick up film, especially in the
offseason, of Ernie's games in New England and see little wrinkles he's done,
and add them to what we do. We talk a lot. There are things that you add to it,
but the base is the same.

"When we won the Super Bowl in Dallas and beat Buffalo [in January 1993], Troy
[Aikman] threw four touchdown passes. Fouts called me the next morning and named
all four plays verbatim. They were the same exact plays."

Nick Ohlig: Miners are still the Miners

BYLINE: By Nick Ohlig, Sports Writer

SECTION: SPORTS

LENGTH: 631 words


Even though I'm out of college, I'm still learning new things every day.

Case in point: UTEP football.

The Miners are 1-5 and with two more losses they will miss a bowl -- again. Up
to this point, there are more questions than answers. Now that UTEP is entering
a bye week, I have learned a few things about the Miners up to this point.

The Miners' defense must get better if they want to salvage their season and
avoid the dreaded double-digit losses. This season, the Miners' defense has been
the elixir to bad offenses. Teams like Tulsa and Colorado State have scored on
this team with ease. And although I still can't wrap my mind around the fact
that Tulsa's offense is considered below average, the Golden Hurricanes have
struggled this year with inconsistent QB play.

I have seen Tulsa play a couple of times this year. One of them was against UTEP
last week. I will say, the Golden Hurricanes' offense did look sharper than in
their previous games.

Another disturbing fact is when teams play against this porous defense, they
score in season highs.

Besides Tulsa, Louisiana Tech and Colorado Sate have scored season highs on
UTEP's defense. Coming into this season, I knew about UTEP and its defense
--they never played any.

Before head coach Sean Kugler arrived in El Paso, playing defense seemed like an
option. Their method to winning was to outscore opponents and hope the
lackadaisical defense gets a much-needed turnover and a victory.

That might be the reason why the Miners struggled during the Mike Price era.
UTEP's offense was never really as explosive as other members in Conference USA
-- i.e. Houston (at the time) or East Carolina.

I have never been a fan of that football philosophy. If a team is serous about
winning at any level, from high school to the NFL, a team must play elite
defense. Whether it is forcing a lot of turnovers or allowing a limited amount
of yards, defense must be played.

As I look at teams in the top five in the country, they each play elite defense.
From Alabama to Clemson, they understand that to win or contend for a BCS title,
they need to play elite defense. And that is the problem with UTEP; they never
have played elite defense. Heck, it would be fair to say the Miners have played
below average defense.

The Miners can't help it. They can't recruit a top-notch defensive player or get
a highly regarded defensive coordinator, but they can try to outscore opponents
-- and that has its risk-reward.

I thought the Miners offense could get boost because of Jameill Showers. I
thought he could be a one-man offensive show, just like Johnny Manziel or Marcus
Mariota. But as long as Showers is confined to run the offense under center and
not able to roam free in the spread offense, then this offense will have a
ceiling.

Showers is not going to be a special passer in this offense. He is too
scattershot with inconsistent accuracy, but he can beat defenses with his legs.
In an era where some QBs are faster than their wide receivers (see Manziel and
Mariota), Showers is being misused. The UTEP offense needs to install a zone-run
offense. I am not saying UTEP needs to be Oregon, but maybe they need to be
Oregon-like.

I do not see Tulane, the habitual bottom-feeder of C-USA, leading the West at
this point. I also do not see Rice as team that has struggled in the West to
have success. It appears the West will tough in the next few years, even though
Tulane and Tulsa are bailing on C-USA. It appears this conference will get
stronger as teams such as Marshall and UTSA start to find themselves. That means
UTEP will have to get better much faster. If they don't, their rebuilding mode
will come slower than expected.

I have learned a lot from the first six games of the season, and the lesson is:
For now, the Miners are still the Miners.

Make no mistake, this is Kyle Shanahan's offence

BYLINE: Mark Maske The Washington Post

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. S3

LENGTH: 887 words


The high-powered offence of the Atlanta Falcons has gotten them to the Super
Bowl. It has landed a head coaching job in San Francisco for offensive
co-ordinator Kyle Shanahan. It could yield a league MVP award for quarterback
Matt Ryan.

It all has worked not only because of the on-field brilliance of Ryan and wide
receiver Julio Jones, but also because of the offensive scheme taken to Atlanta
by Shanahan. That system is a blend of the versions of the West Coast offence
learned by Shanahan from some of his coaching mentors - and his own father, Mike
- with significant wrinkles added by Shanahan.

"You see Gary's offence in it," former Washington Redskins quarterback Joe
Theismann said. "You see Mike's offence in it. Every guy takes parts from the
guys he has worked with. What you see is an offence that has been developed over
time and adapted to Kyle's personality and the personnel that he has."

Mike Shanahan's offences generally blended a traditional West Coast passing game
- the quick-hitting, stretch-the-defence-horizontally approach popularized by
the Bill Walsh-coached 49ers during their glory days - with a running game
utilizing zone blocking by the offensive line and "stretch" plays. That system
produced two Super Bowl triumphs for the Denver Broncos.

Kubiak, a Mike Shanahan coaching protégé who was Kyle Shanahan's boss in Houston
before winning last season's Super Bowl with the Broncos, was particularly
enamoured with putting his quarterback on the move with rollouts and bootlegs.

When Mike Shanahan coached the Redskins and Kyle was the team's offensive
co-ordinator, they added college-style elements to their offence - the pistol
formation and option-style running plays - for the rookie season of quarterback
Robert Griffin III in 2012.

Yet both Shanahans say that Kyle's current offence with the Falcons is
meaningfully different from what Mike Shanahan-coached teams traditionally did.

"Outside zone in running game is the same as before except for wider landmarks,"
Mike Shanahan said via text message. "QB keeps or bootlegs are the same as
before except for more variations. Everything else is different: drop-back
attack concepts, play-action concepts between the tackles, formation variations
and personnel groupings within a game plan, audible system, third-down attack,
red zone attack and two-minute offence."

Kyle Shanahan echoed those sentiments this week in Houston.

"I think we've all grown from different places," he said. "I think the one thing
we all have in common is that the basis, the percentage of our runs are outside
zone. And we do some [quarterback] bootlegs or keepers, whatever you want to
call them, off of that. After that, that's about it.

"When I got to Houston, it was my first time working for Kub. I had spent all
the time with Jon Gruden [as a Tampa Bay Buccaneers assistant] before that. So
we saw offence totally different. We meshed a little bit first time together.
When I went to Washington, that was my first time working with my dad. I thought
we saw football similar. But we quickly realized after a few weeks that we
thought differently. We grew together. He gave me a lot of leeway while I was
there. It was fun to try a bunch of different things, having to even incorporate
the zone read and stuff when we got Robert. But it's always growing."

The Falcons' passing game is not your father's - or, more precisely, Shanahan's
father's - West Coast passing game.

"There's a genesis to it," Theismann said this week. "It has been morphed and
expanded. People put their own personalities into it. The basic principles of
the West Coast offence are that you're going to get the ball out of the
quarterback's hand quickly and you're going to focus on getting yards after the
catch. You're going to use screens. You're going to get the ball into the hands
of the running back and treat those throws almost like running plays."

There is a vertical, down-the-field aspect to the Falcons' offence focused on
making certain that Jones gets his opportunities to make big plays.

"Kyle had Andre Johnson in Houston," Theismann said. "He had Pierre Garcon in
Washington. He has Julio Jones in Atlanta. He's got his guy and he likes to
mould the offence around that. Kyle finds a guy that he concentrates on, and
that's the guy that the offence goes through ... There are vertical aspects to
it. The West Coast offence traditionally was not about 'go' routes and fades. It
was posts and corners. I got into it once with Dwight Clark. I said, 'Joe
Montana can't throw a fade.' Dwight said, 'How many rings does he have?'"

The Falcons have a chance Sunday to win a Super Bowl title. But if they do
manage to upset the New England Patriots, it won't necessarily be another
championship for the offence of Walsh, Gruden, Mike Shanahan, Kubiak and others.
It will be a title for Kyle Shanahan's offence.

"We all originate from the same thing," Kyle Shanahan said. "If you go all the
way back to like, 'What's a West Coast offence?' - we use some of that
terminology. So that's why I think people would say some of this is West Coast.
But everybody's offence is different. And when you go different places, unless
you're just running a playbook, it always changes. And ours has changed every
year. It was different from the beginning. And it's grown a lot different over
the years."

NFL'S IMAGE: Despite downward trend in crimes, problems continue;
 Recent spectacular allegations include sexual assault, battery and an attack on
a police car.;
 BUCKHEAD SLAYINGS

BYLINE: Matt Winkeljohn, Staff

After the National Football League's violent crime policy went into effect in
1997, league officials liked to say that it was discouraging violence among
players.

But that was before the NFL's recent year of living feloniously, lowlighted by
the first two active players in league history being charged with murder.

Baltimore Ravens All-Pro linebacker Ray Lewis' arrest Monday on murder charges
after the stabbing deaths of two men in Buckhead was the latest in a series of
events that have given the league's image a black eye.

Carolina wide receiver Rae Carruth is facing trial over the drive-by shooting
death of his girlfriend, Cherica Adams, who was pregnant with their child, who
survived. When a warrant was issued for Carruth's arrest, he became a fugitive
and was found hiding in the trunk of a car.

According to the league, player arrests have gone from 38 in 1997 to 35 in 1998
to 26 last year. Convictions have gone from 23 to 14 to five (through
September).

But police blotters this past season show:

Miami Dolphins running back Cecil Collins was arrested for breaking into a
neighbor's apartment. The married woman living there told police Collins had
been stalking her.

Buffalo Bills defensive tackle Marcus Spriggs and wide receiver Jeremy McDaniel
were charged in the sexual assault of two off-duty police officers in a
nightclub.

Denver Broncos safety Darrius Johnson was charged with punching a topless
dancer.

Indianapolis Colts defensive back Steve Muhammad was charged with battery in the
beating of his pregnant wife. He was cleared in her death, which was attributed
to injuries suffered in an auto accident.

New York Jets offensive tackle Jumbo Elliott was charged with assault after
being accused of punching a man and a woman in a bar. Matt O'Dwyer, a Jets
teammate then, and now with the Bengals, was arrested in the same incident and
is being sued by three police officers who claim he kicked out a window in their
car, sending shattered glass into their eyes.

And Ray Lewis was charged with punching a woman in a bar.

The league's violent crime policy calls for offending players to undergo
clinical evaluations and counseling. It can include fines or suspensions. The
policy can be applied whether or not a charged player is found guilty.

The first player punished, in August 1998, was New Orleans wide receiver Keith
Poole. He was required to undergo counseling and pay a $ 4,500 fine after
attacking a man with a golf club.

"You know, (crime) is partly a product of society, but that is not where we let
it rest," NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said here last Friday. "We don't
tolerate and we don't condone misconduct."

Because pro athletes are in the public eye, publicity over arrests might seem
like they get in legal trouble more than society as a whole. Whether they are is
a matter of debate.

According to the book "Pros and Cons: The Criminals Who Play in the NFL," 21
percent of active players from 1996 to 1997 had been arrested or convicted of
serious crimes. The NFL disputes these conclusions.

A study by APBnews.com released last week indicated that 13 of the 116 players
on the two rosters for Sunday's Super Bowl XXXIV had been arrested as adults on
a variety of 120 crimes. Those charges ranged from failure by Titans wide
receiver Yancey Thigpen to pay a fine for speeding to the involuntary
manslaughter case against Rams linebacker Leonard Little, who was drunk when his
vehicle ran into another, killing a woman. The NFL suspended Little for a year.

But the study also pointed out that the arrest rate was 11 percent, below the
national average for men in the age groups represented by players in Sunday's
game.

"We need to recognize that some of the misconduct by NFL players has occurred
before they were NFL players --- back when they were teenagers, and in high
school," Tagliabue said.

For many, that's the period in their lives when they begin to receive special
treatment.

"I think our society's worship of elite athletes, because we coddle and fawn
over them, in some ways (means) we've created antisocial beings who believe
their needs come first," Merrill J. Melnick, a sports sociologist at the State
University of New York at Brockport, told The New York Times.

Critics theorize about how the violent nature of the game lends itself to
players being more violent away from it. Others say that the NFL doesn't create
potential lawbreakers; it just happens to employ some.

"There are criminals in the NFL. We don't want them, but they're members of the
general population first before they're in the NFL," Falcons running back Jamal
Anderson said.

"When a day trader . . . blows away 10 people in Buckhead, they don't say he's a
day trader; they say he's crazy. But when he's a football player, that's what
they talk about."

Some argue that the league pol- icy should provide for a lifetime ban of players
such as Little who are convicted of serious crimes. But that is easier said than
done.

"If you just kick guys out of the league immediately, you're going against a
number of right-to-work laws, and some state and federal laws," said Lem
Burnham, NFL vice president for player development.

Negative publicity for the league has not been limited to violent crimes.

One year and one day before Lewis' arrest, Falcons free safety Eugene Robinson
was arrested on the eve of his team's appearance in Super Bowl XXXIII and
charged with attempting to solicit oral sex from an undercover police officer.

His Super Bowl teammate, wide receiver Tony Martin, was acquitted of federal
money-laundering charges last year.

And, in the NFL, behavioral problems are not limited to players.

Former Cowboys coach Barry Switzer was caught in 1997 carrying a gun in an
airport. Former 49ers owner Eddie DeBartolo was suspended after his indictment
on gambling fraud charges.

Mostly, though, the focus is on guys on the field, not the sidelines or the
owners' boxes.

"Of the (1,643 players) in the NFL, to think they're all straight-A people is
ludicrous," said the Falcons' Anderson. "A guy is a person first and a player
second."

Milwaukee man's 'first' drunken-driving conviction was actually his eighth,
police discover

BYLINE: By Linda Spice Milwaukee Journal Sentinel

SECTION: WISCONSIN; Crime and Court Stories

LENGTH: 398 words


Mequon police ticketed a Milwaukee man in October for first-offense drunken
driving, even though he had been convicted of the same offense seven times
before.

Mequon City Attorney John DeStefanis said Tuesday that he and Ozaukee County
District Attorney Sandy Williams would discuss vacating the first-offense
citation against Andrew Robinson, 37, and filing felony charges of eighth-
offense drunken driving.

Robinson was arrested Oct. 4 in Mequon and was found guilty in January of first-
offense OWI, even though his drunken-driving convictions dated to 1992 -- one in
Illinois, one in Wisconsin and five in North Carolina, according to Wisconsin
Department of Transportation records.

The mistake was uncovered after Milwaukee police arrested Robinson on Sunday on
suspicion of a ninth offense.

In the Ozaukee County case, Robinson was fined $677 and had his license revoked
for six months.

When Robinson was arrested in October, a check of his Wisconsin driving record
and criminal history showed he had just one previous OWI offense in 1996 but did
not show the out-of-state convictions, Mequon police Capt. Dan Buntrock said.
Robinson was charged with first-offense OWI because the previous offense
occurred more than 10 years earlier, Buntrock said.

Erin Egan, the state Department of Transportation's chief of citations, said
Robinson's other convictions didn't appear on state records likely because
Robinson had not had a Wisconsin driving permit since 1996.

"We essentially had no contact with Mr. Robinson for 13 years," she said.

In that time, North Carolina and Illinois officials did not report Robinson's
other offenses to Wisconsin, possibly because they didn't know he was from
Wisconsin, Egan said.

The state's next contact with Robinson was the Mequon arrest in October and the
subsequent conviction in Ozaukee County Circuit Court.

That caused state databases to be updated Feb. 19 to include his other offenses,
Egan said.

As a result, the DOT adjusted the January conviction to include a two-year
revocation, she said.

Robinson was ordered to pay the $677 forfeiture in monthly installments of $25,
court records show. The court suspended his license March 5 after he failed to
make forfeiture payments, according to court records.

Robinson remains in the Milwaukee County Jail. Online records show a $250 bail
set on his revocation violation and no bail set for the latest OWI charge.

Make no mistake, this is Kyle's offence

BYLINE: Mark Maske, The Washington Post

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. C3

LENGTH: 890 words


The high-powered offence of the Atlanta Falcons has gotten them to the Super
Bowl. It has landed a head coaching job in San Francisco for offensive
co-ordinator Kyle Shanahan. It could yield a National Football League MVP award
for quarterback Matt Ryan.

It all has worked not only because of the on-field brilliance of Ryan and wide
receiver Julio Jones, but also because of the offensive scheme taken to Atlanta
by Shanahan. That system is a blend of the versions of the West Coast offence
learned by Shanahan from some of his coaching mentors - and his own father, Mike
- with significant wrinkles added by Shanahan.

"You see Gary's offence in it," former Washington Redskins quarterback Joe
Theismann said. "You see Mike's offence in it. Every guy takes parts from the
guys he has worked with. What you see is an offence that has been developed over
time and adapted to Kyle's personality and the personnel that he has."

Mike Shanahan's offences generally blended a traditional West Coast passing game
- the quick-hitting, stretch-the-defence-horizontally approach popularized by
the Bill Walsh-coached 49ers during their glory days - with a running game
utilizing zone blocking by the offensive line and "stretch" plays. That system
produced two Super Bowl triumphs for the Denver Broncos.

Kubiak, a Mike Shanahan coaching protégé who was Kyle Shanahan's boss in Houston
before winning last season's Super Bowl with the Broncos, was particularly
enamoured with putting his quarterback on the move with rollouts and bootlegs.

When Mike Shanahan coached the Redskins and Kyle was the team's offensive
co-ordinator, they added college-style elements to their offence - the pistol
formation and option-style running plays - for the rookie season of quarterback
Robert Griffin III in 2012. Yet both Shanahans say that Kyle's current offence
with the Falcons is meaningfully different from what Mike Shanahan-coached teams
traditionally did.

"Outside zone in running game is the same as before except for wider landmarks,"
Mike Shanahan said via text message. "QB keeps or bootlegs are the same as
before except for more variations. Everything else is different: drop-back
attack concepts, play-action concepts between the tackles, formation variations
and personnel groupings within a game plan, audible system, third-down attack,
red zone attack and two-minute offence."

Kyle Shanahan echoed those sentiments this week in Houston.

"I think we've all grown from different places," he said. "I think the one thing
we all have in common is that the basis, the percentage of our runs are outside
zone. And we do some (quarterback) bootlegs or keepers, whatever you want to
call them, off of that. After that, that's about it.

"When I got to Houston, it was my first time working for Kub. I had spent all
the time with Jon Gruden [as a Tampa Bay Buccaneers assistant] before that. So
we saw offence totally different. We meshed a little bit first time together.
When I went to Washington, that was my first time working with my dad. I thought
we saw football similar. But we quickly realized after a few weeks that we
thought differently. We grew together. He gave me a lot of leeway while I was
there. It was fun to try a bunch of different things, having to even incorporate
the zone read and stuff when we got Robert. But it's always growing."

The Falcons' passing game is not your father's - or, more precisely, Shanahan's
father's - West Coast passing game.

"There's a genesis to it," Theismann said this week. "It has been morphed and
expanded. People put their own personalities into it. The basic principles of
the West Coast offence are that you're going to get the ball out of the
quarterback's hand quickly and you're going to focus on getting yards after the
catch. You're going to use screens. You're going to get the ball into the hands
of the running back and treat those throws almost like running plays."

There is a vertical, down-the-field aspect to the Falcons' offence focused on
making certain that Jones gets his opportunities to make big plays.

"Kyle had Andre Johnson in Houston," Theismann said. "He had Pierre Garcon in
Washington. He has Julio Jones in Atlanta. He's got his guy and he likes to
mould the offence around that. Kyle finds a guy that he concentrates on, and
that's the guy that the offence goes through ... There are vertical aspects to
it. The West Coast offence traditionally was not about 'go' routes and fades. It
was posts and corners. I got into it once with Dwight Clark. I said, 'Joe
Montana can't throw a fade.' Dwight said, 'How many rings does he have?' "

The Falcons have a chance Sunday to win a Super Bowl title. But if they do
manage to upset the New England Patriots, it won't necessarily be another
championship for the offence of Walsh, Gruden, Mike Shanahan, Kubiak and others.
It will be a title for Kyle Shanahan's offence.

"We all originate from the same thing," Kyle Shanahan said. "If you go all the
way back to like, 'What's a West Coast offence?' - we use some of that
terminology. So that's why I think people would say some of this is West Coast.
But everybody's offence is different. And when you go different places, unless
you're just running a playbook, it always changes. And ours has changed every
year. It was different from the beginning. And it's grown a lot different over
the years."

PRINCE GEORGE;
Hoyas' Thompson has taken Carril's offense and run with it

BYLINE: By DICK JERARDI; jerardd@phillynews.com

SECTION: SPORTS; DN Gallery Repository; Pg. 142

LENGTH: 987 words


PRINCETON, N.J. - Pete Carril, 76, was seated at a table in the Princeton Diner
on Route 1 Tuesday morning when the "Princeton offense" came up.

"I resent the use of the words 'Princeton offense,' " Carril, not coaching this
year for the first time in more than a half-century, said. "At first, it was
like a novelty, made you feel good."

Now?

"I'd like to see them bury that name, the Princeton offense," Carril said. "I'm
ready to get the shovel out, get the casket, let's get a skeleton in there and
throw them in the ground."

There will be no ceremony this weekend, not with Georgetown, coached by one of
Carril's favorite players and people, John Thompson III, in the Final Four.

"If you don't have real good players, the Princeton offense isn't going to help
at all," Carril said.

But if you do, you win the Big East, you come from 10 points down in the final 6
minutes against North Carolina in the East Regional final (and then play a
perfect overtime), you win 19 of your last 20 and you get to play Ohio State
tomorrow at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta. What are these Hoyas doing?

"It's the Georgetown offense with a Princeton connection," Carril allowed.

Still, the Princeton offense? What is it, really?

"It's one-third Boston Celtics during the good old days when they were passing
and cutting, one-third the Knick offense [from the early 1970s] and one-third
was what I developed over the course of the years trying to do those things,"
Carril said.

He had a play called the "Celtic" and another called the "Knick." They are still
around.

"You might not get Sam Jones coming off the screen to bank one in, so you stop
there and go to the next sequence," Carril said. "If this wasn't working, we
went to the next thing."

All options had options. They still do, whatever it's called.

"It's an accent on development of skills, not any of this phony stuff that goes
on like slide drills for defense," Carril said. "If you want to improve your
defense, guard a man."

Carril played at Liberty High in Bethlehem, coached at Easton High before a
memorable stint at Reading High in the late 1950s and early 1960s. He was the
coach for one season at Lehigh before his legendary 29-year run at Princeton
that culminated with the backdoor layup that eliminated defending national
champion UCLA in the 1996 NCAA Tournament.

After Princeton, he spent a decade as a Sacramento Kings assistant. He came back
to his house in Princeton every summer. Now, he is just back.

In Princeton these days, Georgetown is referred to as the "varsity." If you saw
the Tigers play this season, you understand. Carril was at most Princeton home
games. And he was at several Georgetown games.

"There is a cerebral element to the way they play," Carril said. "They do a
little probing. They take the fastbreak when they have it. They can play any
style. The former Princeton offense, now dead and buried, was designed to get
you to play against anybody."

Georgetown can play against anybody.

And the Hoyas coach, Carril said, "gets along with everybody. He never forgets
his friends. The guy has started to make his mark and it will increase as time
goes on."

In mid-January, Georgetown was at Rutgers and Seton Hall. Thompson brought his
team to Princeton for a practice.

"They came out of the woodwork, the janitors, the cooks, the trainers, everybody
came out here because he's that way," Carril said.

Thompson played for Princeton a generation ago. He wasn't a star, but Princeton
was never really about stars.

"As a player, he could see the entire picture," Carril said. "He was a great
passer, but did not want to shoot."

One day, Carril watched Thompson being pressed while at Gonzaga High in
Wasington.

"He threw one pass to beat the press," Carril remembered. "He knew where to go.
That's the best sign."

Thompson still knows.

"His understanding of the game is fantastic," Carril said. "When he looks out on
the court to see what's going on, he knows what plays to call to take care of
problems."

It is a gift that he got from Carril.

"If you're a good teacher and you're not an envious-type person, you'd like any
student you had to do better than you did," Carril said.

Carril won't be on the sidelines at the Final Four, but will feel very much a
part of it.

"Even though you never went there yourself, you share the same feeling," Carril
said. "[Thompson] makes you feel that way."

Thompson spent much of the early part of this season experimenting. By March, he
had his team ready. The players had developed their skills. They were a team in
every sense of the term.

Thompson was a first-year assistant on Carril's final Princeton team. He was an
assistant with Bill Carmody for 4 more years before taking over as the head
coach in 2000-01. After 68 wins in four seasons, he was off to Georgetown in
2004.

Carril was at Continental Airlines Arena on Sunday when the Hoyas upset North
Carolina in the East Regional final. He won't be in Atlanta tomorrow, but would
really like to be. He will be watching.

He is being inducted into the Berks County Hall of Fame on Sunday in Reading.
Many of his former Reading High players will be there so he can't miss it. If
Georgetown wins tomorrow, Carril might find his way to Atlanta for Monday's
championship game.

Following breakfast, after a thought morphed into a story - looking back,
remembering names, going over details from games 30 years old - Carril was due
to be interviewed on WFAN radio in New York. He left his cell phone on the
table, but the waitress rescued it.

"I'd love to see some of the calls made on that cell phone," said the man at the
register.

And then Carril was off, talking on the radio, trying to convince the host that
he never really invented anything and explaining that the man he once coached,
the one who will be coaching in the Final Four, was always a step ahead in his
understanding of the game. Now that coach, John Thompson III, has his team a
step from the national championship game. *

TU football: Same old success in new offense for Smith

BYLINE: Bob Hersom, Staff Writer

SECTION: COLLEGE FOOTBALL POSTGAME; Pg. 1C

LENGTH: 568 words

DATELINE: TULSA


TULSA - During the off-season, Tulsa traded in its offense for a newer model.

The driver remains senior Paul Smith, in his third and final season as TU's
starting quarterback.

"I told Paul that I don't want the 2006 version of Paul Smith," TU coach Todd
Graham said. "I want the 2007, new and improved version."

Smith seems to be thriving in the new spread, no-huddle offense. Going into
Saturday night's late game with BYU, Smith had completed 22 of 31 passes for 307
yards and three touchdowns.

"I just feel much more comfortable," Smith said. "I'm able to adjust a little
bit more on the run."

Smith's teammates have noticed a difference in Smith in the new offense.

"He looks a lot more calm and ready," running back Tarrion Adams said.

Tight end Ted Curtis said the new offense gives Smith more opportunities to
showcase his skills.

"He has a little more control. He's just able to use all his weapons," Curtis
said. "There's a lot that Paul can do. With the previous offense there wasn't
room for him to do some of the things that he's good at, so this offense allows
him to take advantage of all of his talents."

Though the offense is new to TU, it isn't new to Smith. Playing for his father,
Ron Smith, he used similar formations in high school, at Deer Creek and Owasso.
He's used to working out of the shotgun, with four or five wideouts.

"He's like a coach on the field with the experience he has," TU co-offensive
coordinator Gus Malzahn said. "He's really helped me be on top of the whole
offense and not worry about him, because he's got it down."

Graham said the new offense is designed to get the ball to the best players, and
that includes Adams, who had a career-high 129 yards rushing in the
season-opening, 35-17 win at Louisiana-Monroe.

"This isn't nuclear physics," Graham said. "You get the ball to your best guys.
The reason why we run the spread is because we want to get the ball in space to
our best people."

The new Tulsa offense is the tried and true West Virginia offense. Graham,
co-offensive coordinator Herb Hand and co-defensive coordinator Paul Randolph
were on the Mountaineers staff together.

Hand is the offensive line coach and the other offensive coordinator, Malzahn,
works with the quarterbacks.

"What you'll see is hopefully a run game like West Virginia's, which is why Herb
Hand is here," Graham said, adding that Hand has done a "fabulous" job with the
offensive linemen.

While Hand and running backs coach Bo Graham work on the running game, Malzahn
and wide receivers coach Bill Blankenship work on the passing game.

"Gus is one of the best in the business," Todd Graham, a former defensive
coordinator, said. "The relationship that I have with him is very important. He
knows the faith that I have in him and what we're doing on offense."

Of course, so does Smith.

"He has the ability to make others better," Malzahn said, "and that's what you
look for in a quarterback. He's a real good decision maker, and that's also
something you look for in a good quarterback."

Graham said Smith is better than ever.

"He makes throws that really dumbfound me," Graham said. "The thing that makes
him great is his intangibles and how other kids play off him."

Smith said, "I'm excited about what we can do with this offense throughout the
season, with little wrinkles, because coach Malzahn's very intelligent and I
know he has a lot of things that he can adjust on."

showcase his skills.

"He has a little more control. He's just able to use all his weapons," Curtis
said. "There's a lot that Paul can do. With the previous offense there wasn't
room for him to do some of the things that he's good at, so this offense allows
him to take advantage of all of his talents."

Though the offense is new to TU, it isn't new to Smith. Playing for his father,
Ron Smith, he used similar formations in high school, at Deer Creek and Owasso.
He's used to working out of the shotgun, with four or five wideouts.

"He's like a coach on the field with the experience he has," TU co-offensive
coordinator Gus Malzahn said. "He's really helped me be on top of the whole
offense and not worry about him, because he's got it down."

Graham said the new offense is designed to get the ball to the best players, and
that includes Adams, who had a career-high 129 yards rushing in the
season-opening, 35-17 win at Louisiana-Monroe.

"This isn't nuclear physics," Graham said. "You get the ball to your best guys.
The reason why we run the spread is because we want to get the ball in space to
our best people."

The new Tulsa offense is the tried and true West Virginia offense. Graham,
co-offensive coordinator Herb Hand and co-defensive coordinator Paul Randolph
were on the Mountaineers staff together.

Hand is the offensive line coach and the other offensive coordinator, Malzahn,
works with the quarterbacks.

"What you'll see is hopefully a run game like West Virginia's, which is why Herb
Hand is here," Graham said, adding that Hand has done a "fabulous" job with the
offensive linemen.

While Hand and running backs coach Bo Graham work on the running game, Malzahn
and wide receivers coach Bill Blankenship work on the passing game.

"Gus is one of the best in the business," Todd Graham, a former defensive
coordinator, said. "The relationship that I have with him is very important. He
knows the faith that I have in him and what we're doing on offense."

Of course, so does Smith.

"He has the ability to make others better," Malzahn said, "and that's what you
look for in a quarterback. He's a real good decision maker, and that's also
something you look for in a good quarterback."

Graham said Smith is better than ever.

"He makes throws that really dumbfound me," Graham said. "The thing that makes
him great is his intangibles and how other kids play off him."

Smith said, "I'm excited about what we can do with this offense throughout the
season, with little wrinkles, because coach Malzahn's very intelligent and I
know he has a lot of things that he can adjust on."

SAINTS ARE (DEFENSIVE) BLAST FROM THE PAST

BYLINE: Bob Sansevere, Staff Columnist

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 11E

LENGTH: 717 words


The endangered-species list just got bigger. Along with the Algerian Nuthatch,
the Banded Wattle-eye, the cheetah, the Hairy-eared Dwarf Lemur and a few
hundred others, you will find highly rated, electrifying offenses facing
extinction.

They're just about gone, all those explosive, souped-up offenses that were
scalding defenses in the regular season. Now that the playoffs are here, they're
about as prevalent as the Pig-footed Bandicoot.

There's really only one offense of the highly rated, electrifying species left
in the postseason, and that might be because it hasn't played yet.

The Vikings, who have the NFL's fifth-ranked offense, are the last of the
kick-butt breed. Which means they could be a dying breed.

The league's three highest-ranked offenses were dumped from the playoffs this
past weekend. The top-ranked St. Louis Rams were beaten 31-28 by the New Orleans
Saints on Saturday.

The second-ranked Denver Broncos failed to score a touchdown for the first time
in 28 postseason games and were routed 21-3 Sunday by the Baltimore Colts.

The third-ranked Indianapolis Colts lost 23-17 to the Miami Dolphins on
Saturday.

The normally high-flying offenses of the Rams, Broncos and Colts came up against
suffocating defenses. Smash-mouth beat flash every time.

As the NFL moves into the latest millennium, the clock has been turned back to a
time when defenses were lords and masters over offenses. Six of the eight teams
in the playoffs have defenses ranked among the league's top 10.

The Vikings aren't in that group. The truth is, the Vikings have the
worst-ranked defense of the eight playoff teams. They've been torched so many
times they should be wearing flame-retardant jerseys.

Only three teams in the league were ranked lower than the No. 28 Vikings during
the regular season. They really took a nosedive in the final three games,
allowing 1,353 yards. That's more than three-quarters of a mile. Custer played
better defense at the Little Big Horn.

If statistical rankings mean anything, and they sure did in playoff games this
past weekend, the Vikings soon could be vicuna, which you'll also find on the
endangered-species list.

Vikings fans shouldn't book those airline tickets to Tampa for Super Bowl XXXV
just yet. The Vikings still have to maneuver past the Saints and, if they
accomplish that, beat the New York Giants or Philadelphia Eagles in the NFC
championship game.

Not to spoil anyone's New Year in these parts, but the Giants, Saints and Eagles
have defenses that ranked fifth, eighth and 10th, respectively, in the league.

The Saints didn't beat the Rams with luck. They did it with a defense that
tormented Kurt Warner and manacled league MVP Marshall Faulk while setting up
their opportunistic offense.

The Saints might be the most balanced team in the NFC or AFC playoffs. They're
the only team still in the postseason with an offense and defense ranked in the
top 10.

This is a scary team, one that isn't likely to let a little thing such as a
manic Metrodome crowd be bothersome. In November, the Saints lost their star
running back (Ricky Williams), their starting quarterback (Jeff Blake) and, in
the opening moments against the Rams, their best wide receiver (Joe Horn)
suffered a game-ending ankle injury. None of that stopped them. They kept on
rolling.

These Saints are mighty dangerous. Especially on the road, where they went 7-1
and became the first team to qualify for the playoffs while finishing with a
losing record at home.

The Vikings better hope Daunte Culpepper's ankle is healed, at least well enough
so he can stand in the pocket and launch bombs to Randy Moss.

That might be the Vikings' best hope for beating the Saints, sticking a dagger
in their soul with long passes to Moss.

To do that, Culpepper will need time, something the Saints don't give
quarterbacks. They led the league with 66 sacks and were the only team to have
three players with 11 or more - La 'Roi Glover (17), Joe Johnson (12) and Darren
Howard (11).

Quarterbacks become endangered species when these guys are turned loose.

The Vikings better watch out. They're in danger of becoming extinct, just like
the dinosaurs.

Clark Atlanta believes it's ready for next level

At least six times during the first 15 minutes of a recent pre- season practice,
Clark Atlanta coach Willie Hunter loudly reprimanded players who were not
executing their responsibilities properly.

"We're teaching techniques, and we aren't going to let them get away with a
thing," Hunter said. "This is the year we intend to take this program to another
level, and with the size of our squad, we've got to do almost everything right."

The Panthers, who ended up 5-5 after losing four of their first six games last
season, including 7-0 defeats against Alabama A&M and Kentucky State, are a
small squad in terms of numbers. But Hunter and his staff seemed convinced that
there is enough talent among the 60 or so players to take on the likes of I-AA
opponents Hampton and labama State and be respectable.

"By playing teams like that, we can get a feel for what we have and what we need
to do to get to that next level," Hunter said.

CAU will face Hampton in the first game of a doubleheader at the Georgia Dome
Sept. 1, and take on Alabama State in Mobile Oct. 12.

This season, the Panthers' offensive attack will have to be spearheaded by
someone other than 6-foot-2, 265-pound running back Chris Ryan, who was cut by
the Minnesota Vikings earlier this month. Ryan averaged 7 yards on 168 carries
last season.

"We don't have another Chris Ryan, but we do have some backs who can get the job
done," Hunter said.

Tailback Alfred Kitchens, the team's second-leading rusher in '95 with 692
yards, is back for his senior season. Among those expected to complement him are
JUCO transfer Derrick Dunn (6-0, 210), and Monte Dilworth (5-8, 200), a senior
who carried the ball only three times last year.

Quarterback Darrell White, who split time with fellow transfer Jamal Burns and
Takia Oglesby last year, just may be nudged out of the starting job by yet
another JUCO transfer. That would be David Kennedy, a 6-2, 195- pound junior who
set numerous offensive records at Phoenix (Ariz.) Community College.

Oglesby, a senior honor student who is actually at CAU on an academic
scholarship, will not be involved in a dual role as in the past, when also lined
up at a wideout spot.

Perhaps the biggest impact players for the Panthers will be on defense. They
include down linemen Marcus Evers, a 6-5, 275-pound senior, and JUCO transfer
Billy Anderson (6-0, 270) at nose guard. Evers is receiving a lot of attention
from pro scouts.

Though leading tacklers Greg Jackson and Shawn Mitchell return at linebacker,
redshirt freshman Preston Moses, who at 6-2, 245 is one of the strongest players
on the team, may emerge as the star at that position.

"The thing that stands out about this whole group is the fact that they're
focused, and they came back with some clearly defined goals," Hunter said. "I'm
not into predicting, but I will say that they're going to be ready to play, and
they'll give all they've got. I can live with whatever happens after that."

The Maroon Tigers' defense, which ranked next to last in the SIAC against the
pass after injuries sidelined three starters in the secondary, should be
improved. While nose guard James Stancil anchors the line, DBs Rosby Johnson,
Derrick Quarterman and Sam Chavis are expected to take a lot more pressure off a
group of linebackers led by Kimbert Frye.

"This is a solid bunch of kids we've got here, and they've got a lot of
character," Hunt said. "We're hoping their talent and character combined will be
enough to see us through."

VOICES/Should adultery be a criminal offense?

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 10A

LENGTH: 357 words


Otis Ketron 34
Mechanical design eng.
Erlanger, Ky.

Yes. There's no question in my mind that adultery is morally wrong, and it
should be against the law. In Northern Kentucky, people involved in prostitution
are being slapped with a fine, and their names are being printed in the
newspaper. Something like that should be done for adultery.

Jessie Dinneen, 58
Office manager
West Haven, Conn.

Absolutely not. Are you kidding? If that were the case, there wouldn't be enough
jails or prisons to put everyone in who committed adultery. It certainly
couldn't be enforced because nine out of 10 people are probably guilty of it,
even though they won't admit it. Adultery is an uncontrollable situation.

Bob Lee, 41
Building inspector
Crestline, Calif.

Yes, although I don't know what should be done for punishment. Americans
wouldn't stand for public lashings like they do in other countries, and adultery
is not the type of crime that should carry a jail term. Maybe a fine is the only
appropriate punishment for adultery, but it should be punishable.

Andrea Hollimon, 38
Store checker
Las Vegas, Nev.

No. I'm a firm believer in obedience to God's laws, and when you commit
adultery, you commit an offense against yourself, your partner and God. But I
don't feel that adultery is a criminal offense. Although adultery does cause a
breakdown of society, it's not going to stop by putting people in jail.

Jay Hipwell, 42
Sales manager
Omaha, Neb.

Morally, adultery is wrong. But just because something is morally wrong doesn't
mean it's a criminal offense. Also, as long as a law is effective, its age
shouldn't be an issue. There are laws against blacks that shouldn't still be on
the books. But murder laws have been effective for hundreds of years.

Rita Hill, 61
Mental health counselor
Muskogee, Okla.

No. Adultery is ridiculous as a criminal offense. It's a moral offense, but
morals can't be legislated. Besides that, adultery is up to the people involved.
If it's a problem for them, they should find the best solution possible. It
should not be up to our country to solve our personal problems.

Score more, Broncos, or else

BYLINE: The Denver Post

No offense, but the Broncos nevertheless have no offense.

The Orange Mush is averaging below two touchdowns per game no matter who's the
quarterback.

So, go ahead, fickle faced fanatical, fixated folks, and anoint Brock Osweiler
as the next King Super QB in Broncos history.

In their Super Bowl years the Broncos scored 31, 39, 42, 36, 45, 58 and 71
offensive touchdowns an average of 46 per regular season.

With four games remaining the Broncos are on pace for 31 touchdowns the same as
the 1977 team and 40 behind 2013's version.

Good thing there's the OC2 defense.

In eight of 12 games the Broncos' offense with Mannweiler has scored 0, 1 or 2
touchdowns. Brock Osweiler's offense produced a season high four touchdowns (the
last in overtime) against New England; Peyton Manning's offense managed three
touchdowns in three games.

Brock Montana got two touchdowns and one touchdown in his other starts. Manning
had zero in three games.

Good thing the NFL still allows field goals.

The Broncos are averaging 1.9 touchdowns, 1.8 field goals.

They tied the Patriots last season for first in the league in offensive
touchdowns per game (3.3). This season they are wallowing at the bottom with San
Francisco, St. Louis, Dallas and Cleveland. They, too, have changed
quarterbacks.

For those who have conveniently forgotten, in the earlier confrontation between
the Broncos and the Oakland Raiders, Denver put up zilch on offense against its
ex defensive coordinator. The Broncos relied on four field goals and a 74 yard
pick six play by Chris Harris.

Jack Del Rio knows Os weiler better than any of the Broncos' coaches. He watched
the quarterback up close in practices, exhibitions and OTAs from 2012 14.

Imagine what Del Rio will dial up for Os or O's? on Sunday afternoon.

Then, there's Cincinnati and Pittsburgh.

Everybody in town wants to argue the merits of whether Manning if and when he is
healthy or Osweiler should be the quarterback. It doesn't make a difference if
the rest stay the same.

Who is responsible for this anemic offense the offensive line, the running
backs, the tight ends, the wide receivers (hello, Demaryius, I'm talking to and
about you), the quarterback, Gary Kubiak?

Sure, injuries have stacked up in the line with Ryan Clady, his replacement Ty
Sambrailo and guards Evan Mathis and Louis Vasquez. C.J. Anderson is hurt again,
and Ronnie Hillman isn't feeling so hot himself. Emmanuel Sanders has played
through pain, and Owen Daniels seems to be on the limited practice schedule each
week, and Vernon Davis was concussed in San Diego.

Sure, the Broncos have new coaches and a new system on offense.

Who designed this offense Mike Shanahan, Bill Walsh, Dan Reeves, Gary Kubiak or
Rush Limbaugh?

Sure, the Broncos are relying on their defense. But, nine important defensive
players have been injured and/or suspended, and they have a new coaching staff.
Yet, they are No. 1 in the league and the best in Broncos history since the
original Orange Crush. They aren't making excuses or performing poorly with
backups.

The Broncos had better get their act together on offense, or they will lose two
of their final four and end up as the No. 3 seed in the AFC, and be forced to
play Kansas City or Pittsburgh the first weekend of the postseason, then should
they avoid another home loss in the playoffs the Bengals in Cincinnati and,
heaven please forbid, the Patriots in New England.

If they don't reach the Super Bowl with this anodyne offense, both starting
quarterbacks could be gone Peyton to retirement or to the New Orleans Saints,
Brock to the Texans as a free agent and it will be Trevor Siemian and some QB to
be named later vs. the world.

What to do? The Broncos' offense must color outside the lines breaking through
the rigid boundaries and becoming more creative risk takers.

I've been saving the good news, though.

The '77 original Orange Crush did get to the Super Bowl with 31 touchdowns. The
2000 Super Bowl winning Baltimore Ravens had only 29 touchdowns from their
offense in the regular season.

And the Seahawks of 2013 scored 30.

It's a rare achievement, but possible. And both Seattle and Baltimore did score
three touchdowns on offense in the Super Bowl.

TD3 is the goal, Broncos.

No offense, no chance.

Man killed defending home

An Atlanta man died early Thursday morning trying to keep two robbers from
breaking into his home, police said.

When two men tried to break through the front door at 2838 Browntown Road about
2:30 a.m., Kelvin Veasey, 43, tried to hold the door shut with his shoulder,
said Atlanta police homicide Sgt. Keith Meadows. One robber fired a shot and the
bullet hit Veasey's chest.

As he was on the floor, bleeding, the robbers pushed their way past Veasey and a
woman in Veasey's home. The robbers took items from his home and fled, Meadows
said. Police got a minimal description of one robber, who the woman said was in
his early 20s.

Veasey later died at Grady Memorial Hospital.
 DEKALB COUNTY Alabama cousins charged in killing Two Alabama cousins have been
charged in the slaying of a man tentatively identified as a Gwinnett County
businessman. Authorities are awaiting dental records to identify the body, found
in a lake near Panama City, Fla. Police believe the victim may be John Paul
Stumler, 57, of Dacula, who was reported missing Dec. 4 by his wife. Gadsden,
Ala., police Lt. Steve Daniels said Stumler's dental records were being sent to
Gadsden and Florida authorities. Stumler had a computer business in Gadsden.
Stumler's business partner, Franklin David Smith, 29, of Gallant, Ala., was
arrested late Wednesday on murder charges. Bay County, Fla., Sheriff Guy Tunnell
said in Panama City that Smith owed a large amount of money to Stumler. Smith's
cousin, Rebekah Lucille Tidwell, 30, of Gadsden, was arrested on a warrant
charging first-degree hindering prosecution, according to a Gadsden police
report. The body was found in Lake Powell near Panama City on Tuesday.
 Baseball thrown at bus injures schoolchild A 5-year-old DeKalb County
elementary school student was injured Thursday afternoon after someone threw a
baseball through the window of a bus the student was riding in. The Evansdale
Elementary School student was cut by glass when the ball broke the window. The
student was treated by paramedics on the scene, said school system spokesman
Spencer Ragsdale.
 COBB COUNTY City manager upholds Acworth police firings Acworth City Manager
Brian Bulthuis on Tuesday upheld the firings of two Acworth police officers who
allegedly beat a man who was arrested for a domestic dispute. The officers,
whose names have not been released, were fired last month for the October
incident involving the arrest of Acworth resident Terry Strain. Strain told a
local TV news station that he was considering suing the city of Acworth,
claiming that the officers brutalized him while he was in their custody. Strain
said he suffered a dislocated shoulder, bruises and cuts. Bulthuis said the
officers were terminated for violating departmental policy and procedure.
 COLUMBUS Career soldier found guilty in rape of girl A Fort Benning soldier has
been convicted of assaulting and molesting a girl who said he raped her over a
two-year span. A Muscogee County jury deliberated six hours before returning the
guilty verdict Wednesday against Sgt. 1st Class Daniel Spottsville, 39. Superior
Court Judge John Allen sentenced him to 30 years in prison for aggravated
assault and child molestation. Spottsville was acquitted on rape and burglary
charges. The girl, whose mother had dated Spottsville, is now a 15-year-old high
school sophomore. Spottsville already is serving a 17-year sentence on charges
stemming from a high-speed chase two days after the girl reported the rape. His
pay and military privileges were suspended after his arrest in July 1997 and he
now will be discharged, Fort Benning spokeswoman Elsie Jackson said Thursday.
 CLINCH COUNTY School board cancels candid camera show A Clinch County High
School media specialist has been fired for setting up a video camera in a locker
room used by visiting female athletes. David Hinson was fired last week on a 4-1
vote by the Clinch County Board of Education. A three-member state tribunal had
recommended the firing last month. Hinson was cleared of criminal eavesdropping
charges in September. But he and other school officials still face a $ 9 million
civil suit filed by members of the Lanier County High School girls' basketball
team and cheerleading squad, who had used the locker room after the camera was
set up in 1996. The locker room was videotaped in an apparent attempt to catch
thieves after Valdosta High School players reported losing about $ 2,000 in
jewelry and other valuables during a visit to Clinch County.
 HEPHZIBAH Bus collision leaves seven students injured Seven Hephzibah High
School students suffered cuts and bruises when one school bus rear-ended
another. The students were treated and released at a hospital after the accident
Wednesday. The accident happened as the two buses were leaving the high school
in Hephzibah, southwest of Augusta. The first bus slammed on its brakes in an
effort to avoid a pickup truck and was struck from behind by the second bus.
About 40 students were on each bus, said Gene Sullivan, assistant superintendent
of Richmond County schools.
 JACKSON COUNTY Victim may have interrupted robbery Police believe a Jackson
County woman whose body was found near her rural home was shot to death after
interrupting a robbery shortly after noon Tuesday. Kimberly Kay Warren, 40, of
Pendergrass was found dead in her car in a creek a few hundred feet from her
home Tuesday. Sheriff Stan Evans said he has no suspects, but that a small gray
or silver car was spotted in the area about noon Tuesday when Warren returned
home. Evans said he is cautioning area residents to be careful because whoever
killed her is still out there and still armed.

WVU places 2 on Big 12 preseason team

July 13--MORGANTOWN, W.Va. -- West Virginia University senior defensive lineman
Noble Nwachukwu and senior center Tyler Orlosky have been named to the Big 12
Preseason All-Conference Team, today, as selected by media representatives who
cover the league.

The honorees include nine seniors, 11 juniors and 11 sophomores with only one
holdover from last year's preseason squad in running back Samaje Perine
(Oklahoma). Five players were chosen to the 2015 All-Big 12 First Team while 10
were on the second team.

Nwachukwu, the Big12 Conference's returning sack leader in conference games
only, finished with 47 tackles, including 37 solo stops and a team-leading 8.5
sacks and 13.5 tackles for loss. He was ranked No. 5 in sacks and No. 12 in
tackles for loss and he was No. 2 in sacks and No. 3 in tackles for loss in
conference games only

Orlosky has been named to the 2016 Rimington Trophy Fall Watch, signifying the
top NCAA Division I center in the nation and the Outland Trophy Watch List for
the top interior lineman.

He earned the distinction of being the top center in the nation, heading into
the 2016 season, by USA Today and has landed on various All-American and All-Big
12 Conference teams by preseason publications.

Orlosky, an All-Big 12 Second Team member from Cleveland, Ohio, started all 13
games last season and saw action on more than 1,000 plays. He helped pave the
way for the offense to average 479.7 yards per game of total offense, 34.0
points, 228.2 rushing yards and 251.5 passing yards. The offense ranked No. 17
nationally in rushing offense, No. 18 in first down offense and No. 23 in total
offense.

He graded out 90 percent or better in all 13 games last season. The WVU rushing
attack produced 200 or more yards in six games, 300 or more yards in three games
and a season-high 426 yards at Kansas. In the last six games of 2015, the
rushing offense averaged 251 yards per game and 499.3 yards of total offense.

Orlosky is one of only two returning all-conference offensive linemen from 2015
and is the only returning Big 12 lineman listed on the final ranking of the
Schneider Scale (ranks the best 25 linemen in the nation and is used for the
Outland Trophy).

Selections for the preseason individual awards are quarterback Baker Mayfield
(Oklahoma) as Offensive Player of the Year, linebacker Malik Jefferson (Texas)
as Defensive Player of the Year and quarterback Kenny Hill (TCU) as Newcomer of
the Year.

The Big 12 media preseason poll will be released on Thursday, followed by the
annual Big 12 Football Media Days to be conducted in Dallas on July 18-19. Both
days will be televised live from 9:00 a.m. -- 1:00 p.m. CT on FS2 and other FOX
Sports affiliates. Exclusive, live coverage from the event will also be
available on the Big 12's digital platforms -- Big12Sports.com, Twitter and
Instagram (@Big12Conference). The official hashtag for the event will be
#Big12FB.

Roper's goals: Pick up pace and score;
UF's new offensive coordinator likes the up-tempo, spread style

BYLINE: Garry Smits

SECTION: Pg. C-1

LENGTH: 754 words


GAINESVILLE | Kurt Roper could be the second coming of Hall of Fame coach Bill
Walsh as a developer of quarterbacks and an offensive playcaller and it still
might not keep him employed at the University of Florida beyond the 2014 season.

So why did he leave the security of being the offensive coordinator at Duke the
last six years for the bubbling cauldron of Gator football, knowing that he's
tied to the same short leash of head coach Will Muschamp?

"It's the University of Florida," said Roper on Monday during a news conference
at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium. "This is a great university with a history and a
lot of championships."

The Gators had better win something next season, or show significant improvement
from a 4-8 record and an offense that finished 112th in the nation in scoring
and 113th in the nation in total offense.

That's where Roper comes in. He was introduced by Muchamp on Monday along with
the other two staff hires, Mike Summers (offensive line) and Coleman Hutzler
(special teams).

In addition to Roper's tenure at Duke, where his offense last season helped the
Blue Devils win 10 games for the first time in school history and reach the ACC
championship game, Roper has previous stops at Mississippi, Kentucky and
Tennessee.

He has coached NFL quarterbacks such as Eli Manning, Thaddeus Lewis and Sean
Renfree.

Summers, who has been coaching for 33 years, was the line coach at Southern
California last season, and has a resume, in descending order, that includes
stops at Western Kentucky, Arkansas, the Atlanta Falcons, Louisville, Oklahoma
State, Sewanee, Oregon State, Northern Illinois, Kentucky and Texas A&M.

Hutzler is making a return trip to Florida. He was a defensive and special teams
assistant in 2010-2011 and has been at New Mexico State. He also coached at
Stanford and San Diego.

But the most pressure and interest will be on Roper as he attempts to modernize
the Florida offense. He promises an up-tempo, no-huddle attack and Muschamp
promises to give him room to work.

"He'll have the autonomy to run the offense and stay balanced," Muschamp said.

Muschamp likes the fact that Roper's teams have moved the ball in two-back sets
with the quarterback under center and with the quarterback primarily in a
shotgun or pistol.

"I think his background speaks for itself as far as being a two-back team at Ole
Miss and now you're looking at Duke and a lot of the spread principles we need
to look at. So I think it'll mix well with what we're trying to do here at the
University of Florida with our players and the development of our guys."

Roper said he cares more about points than yardage, and cares little how those
points are achieved.

But the pace of play for the Gator offense will be dialed up to compete with SEC
systems such as Auburn and Missouri.

"I think what ends up happening, if you can play the game with some tempo and
speed and you can play it in space, you can create as many one-on-one tackle
opportunities as you can," he said. "If you can create a bunch of one-on-one
tackle opportunities then you have a chance to have positive yards and positive
yards keep you on the field."

Roper will have the quarterback Jeff Driskel returning from a broken leg in the
third game of the 2013 season, and running backs Mack Brown, Matt Jones (who
will miss spring because of his knee injury) and Kelvin Taylor; wide receivers
Andre Debose, Latroy Pittman, Quinton Dunbar and Ahmad Fulwood of Jacksonville,
and three offensive line starters.

"All the tools are going to be in place for us to go and win football games," he
said. "Obviously, there's guys that can catch the football, run the football,
throw the football and we've got to figure out the best way to structure it to
put those guys in place to do that. But obviously, I think there are some really
good football players here."

Roper knows enough about Driskel to look forward to working with him.

"The thing that you see is that he's a big guy that can move and the ball comes
out of his hand well," Roper said. "From there I'm looking forward to developing
a relationship with him and we'll learn a little bit more in the spring."

Incoming freshman Will Grier, who put up monster numbers in a small-school
division in North Carolina, has already enrolled and will be at spring practice.

Muschamp said no starting job is safe.

"When you're 4-8, it's all open," he said. "You are what your record is. I'm a
4-8 coach and we've got a 4-8 ballclub. We need to work hard to get better and
improve in every facet."

2 Navy athletes accused of rape
Two Naval Academy football players were arrested Monday in Annapolis, Md., on
charges of raping a female midshipman at an off-campus party. Cordrea
Brittingham, 21, of Berlin, Md., and Arion Keith Williams, 21, of Detroit, were
charged with second-degree rape, a felony punishable by up to 30 years in
prison. They were held in lieu of $ 250,000 bail each.

The alleged assault occurred late Thursday or early Friday. The woman said she
had become intoxicated and passed out in a bedroom. When she awoke, she found
herself being assaulted, police said.

The Naval Academy has been rocked in recent years by a series of scandals
involving drug use, car thefts and sexual assaults on female midshipmen.

Book alleges crime by N.Y. mayor's dad
A forthcoming biography of New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani says the mayor's
father, Harold Giuliani, served a year and a half in state prison for robbing a
milk deliveryman. According to the book, "Rudy! An Investigative Biography of
Rudolph Giuliani," by Wayne Barrett, the elder Giuliani in 1934, 10 years before
Rudolph Giuliani's birth, pulled a gun on a milkman in a corridor of a building
on East 96th Street and, with an accomplice, robbed him of $ 128.82. The mayor
declined to comment on the account.

Companies agree to pay for trafficking fireworks
Two Las Vegas companies have agreed to pay $ 90,000 in fines to settle
allegations that they imported banned fireworks, the Consumer Product Safety
Commission said Monday. The commission had accused Red Rock Trading Co. and
Blackjack Fireworks of importing about 730,000 banned fireworks devices between
1994 and 1999 for distribution in the United States.

Woman found guilty of ordering robberies
A woman who called herself the "Daughter of God" was convicted in Fort Myers,
Fla., of seven felonies for ordering her followers to rob stores to support
their lavish lifestyle. Sentencing for Richelle Denise Bradshaw, who called
herself Queen Shahmia, was set for Aug. 9.

2 more swimmers attacked by sharks
Two teenagers were bitten by sharks as they swam in the Atlantic off New Smyrna
Beach, Fla. Danielle Shidemantle, 19, of Lake Mary, was bitten Sunday on the
upper left thigh by what what was described as a 3-foot-long shark. Two hours
later, Amber Benningfield, 13, of Bowling Green, Ky., was bitten in her left
calf. Shidemantle was treated and released, but the younger girl was admitted to
a hospital in stable condition.

N.Y. officers disciplined in Central Park attacks
Five New York police officers and three 911 dispatchers will face disciplinary
action for failing to do their jobs during a series of attacks on women in
Central Park last month, the city's police commissioner said Monday. In
addition, six commanding officers have been reprimanded. The attacks occurred
June 11 after New York's annual Puerto Rican Day Parade.

Around the South REGION IN BRIEF Girl admits lying about sexual abuse

SECTION: NATIONAL NEWS; Section A; Page 3

LENGTH: 451 words


A Florida teenager could face criminal charges for falsely accusing the man who
raised her as his daughter of sexually abusing her for years, police say.

Kimberly Mays, who was swapped at birth with another baby and raised by that
child's family, admitted to investigators Friday night that she had falsely
accused Robert Mays, the man who raised her, of sexual abuse, Phil Ramer of the
state Department of Law Enforcement said at a news conference Monday in Tampa.

Kimberly, 15, who began living with her biological parents, Regina and Ernest
Twigg, this year after trying to "divorce" them in court, initially made the
allegation Sept. 12, telling investigators in Sebring that Mays had abused her
since she was 7.

But Ramer said investigators found inconsistencies in her accounts of the abuse
and that the girl admitted she was lying when confronted with the
inconsistencies. Prosecutors and Mays said they hope she will seek counseling.

A SORE SPOT: Negative stories about racial conflict in the town of Wedowee are
"cutting off the legs" of Alabama's attempts to promote itself to outside
business interests, says the head of the Economic Development Partnership of
Alabama. Neal Wade, in a weekend visit to Wedowee, urged residents to undertake
a methodical, biracial attempt to solve problems, and he said he has lined up $
200,000 in gifts from corporations to help rebuild Randolph County High School,
which was set afire just before classes were to open there last month. The
town's racial conflict stems from a mixed-race student's charges that the
school's former principal called her "a mistake."

A LITERARY GIFT: Saying that he'd never be able to find "a coffin with bookshe
lves," a leading scholar on F. Scott Fitzgerald has donated what has been called
the world's largest private collection of the author's works to the University
of South Carolina in Columbia. Matthew Bruccoli, who teaches English at the
university, assembled the materials over the past 35 years, and his collection
is valued at $ 2 million. The collection includes galley proofs of "The Great
Gatsby" before Fitzgerald rewrote it and the author's personal whiskey flask.

Bills no-huddle offense may be no more

BYLINE: Wire services

SECTION: SPORTS; Football

LENGTH: 550 words


The Buffalo Bills no-huddle offense has suddenly become the no-comment attack.

If the Bills intend to scuttle running the offense they've used since May, no
one was willing to say after practice Thursday as the team prepares to play at
the New York Jets this weekend.

A Bills media relations official told reporters to ask only injury-related
questions to Dick Jauron, though the coach has often discussed other topics on
previous Thursdays. When a reporter asked Jauron about the no-huddle attack, the
coach walked away without saying a word.

The Bills offense is being blamed for the team's 1-4 start, and is under
additional criticism after a 6-3 loss to Cleveland on Sunday. With a young and
inexperienced offensive line, Buffalo was flagged nine times for false-start
penalties and failed to score an offensive touchdown for the second time in
three weeks.

Obituary: Cullen Bryant, a mainstay of the Los Angeles Rams for 11 seasons and a
running back on the 1979 team that went to the Super Bowl, has died. He was 58.
Bryant died Tuesday of natural causes at his home in Colorado Springs, Colo.,
according to sister-in-law Wanda E. Bryant. She said that Bryant had,
unbeknownst to the family, been under a doctor's care and that his death was a
surprise even to his three brothers. A second-round pick of the Rams in 1973, he
played for the team from 1973-1982, and again in 1987. He spent the 1983-84
seasons with Seattle.

Browns: Pro Bowl nose tackle Shaun Rogers missed his second straight day of
practice because of a non-injury related absence. The team expects him to return
today and to play in Sunday's game at Pittsburgh.

Lions: Detroit quarterback Matthew Stafford has been held out of practice for
the third time in four days, leaving his availability in question for Sunday's
game at Green Bay. The No. 1 overall draft choice suffered a knee injury in
Detroit's Oct. 4 loss at Chicago and sat out last weekend's game against
Pittsburgh. Daunte Culpepper had 282 yards passing with a touchdown and an
interception in the Lions' 28-20 loss.

Titans: The NFL has fined Tennessee defensive end Kyle Vanden Bosch $5,000 for
his hit on Indianapolis quarterback Peyton Manning. Vanden Bosch said Thursday
he knows what the rule is on not hitting quarterbacks around the knees. But
Vanden Bosch had been blocked and was going down as he grabbed Manning's legs in
Sunday night's 31-9 loss to the Colts. Coach Jeff Fisher, co-chairman of the
competition committee, said earlier this week that the rule states roughing the
passer should not be called if a player is blocked into a quarterback.

Jets: Wide receiver Jerricho Cotchery missed a second straight day of practice
because of a hamstring injury and was uncertain whether he'll be ready to play
against Buffalo.

Panthers: Jon Beason apologized for calling out Carolina teammate Julius Peppers
for his lack of production last week, even after the Panthers responded with
their first win. "After what happened, I realized I was wrong," Beason said on
radio station WFNZ. "There are certain things you shouldn't say in public,
certain things that should remain in-house. That's where I made my mistake."
Peppers, a four-time Pro Bowl choice making an NFL-high $16.7 million salary
this season, had just one sack and 10 tackles in Carolina's 0-3 start.

ANALYSIS;
Offense not fit for 1990s;
Falcons' anachronistic attack ranks 26th in the NFL

BYLINE: Len Pasquarelli; STAFF WRITER

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 03G

LENGTH: 533 words


The grainy images flickered across cable-wired televisions on Tuesday night as
ESPN reprised the storied 1967 "Ice Bowl" championship game between Green Bay
and Dallas.

For Atlanta Falcons fans, more noteworthy than Bart Starr's famous 1-yard sneak
behind guard Jerry Kramer and center Ken Bowman might have been the presence of
Dan Reeves in the Cowboys backfield. Of alarm to those same fans should have
been the familiar look of the Dallas attack.

Fast forward three decades to the videotape from last week's uninspired defeat
at San Francisco, and the Atlanta offense of the late-1990s appears strikingly
similar to what Tom Landry originally designed in the '60s.

It would be unfair to term Reeves a retread coach. But it might be appropriate
to label his offense as retro.

"You hate to use the term 'obsolete,' because effective (offenses) encompass a
variety of formulas," said former NFL quarterback Hugh Millen, a 10-year
journeyman with six different teams who remains an avid student of X's and O's.
"The (Atlanta) offense looks fundamentally sound . . . but it doesn't seem like
it has kept pace with current trends."

Entering Sunday's game with Denver, the Atlanta offense is No. 26 in the NFL.
The most obvious contributor to the Falcons' 0-4 start is a disappointing
rushing game ranked next to last and on pace to establish a new franchise nadir
for yards gained.

For an offense being stopped cold, the buck stops with Reeves, who, typically,
accepts culpability for the shortcomings.

Even so, the veteran coach still has his supporters.

"He's still (as) sharp as ever," former Giants quarterback Phil Simms said. "The
offense is sound and disciplined. If the running game works, (the offense)
works."

Reeves did inherit run-and-shoot personnel and is having to re-tool for a more
conventional system.

But other coaches in new situations have adapted to enhance the performance of
personnel on-hand until they can get their own players in place. Witness Bill
Parcells, who certainly wasn't enamored at throwing the ball 40 times a game at
New England or with the Jets, but did so anyway.

Conversely, Reeves is attempting to win with players who can't do the things he
is asking of them. The result: The offense will be in place at year's end, but
another personnel housecleaning looms.

On the day he was introduced here, Reeves conceded that his offense probably
needed revamping and hinted at bringing in a West Coast-style devotee to tinker
with it. But eight months later, Reeves still wears the headset and calls most
of the plays.

In his 20 seasons as a coordinator and head coach, Reeves nine times had
offenses ranked in the top 10. Only one of those, though, came in the last six
seasons. His offensive ranking for the last three seasons with the Giants was
28th, 29th and 30th.

When Reeves employed current Denver coach Mike Shanahan as his coordinator, he
compiled a record of 75-41-1. Without Shanahan, he is 74-76.

Queried about the evolution of his offense during camp, Reeves agrees that
inertia "just means you're falling behind." Through one-quarter of the season,
those words seem to have become a self-fulfilling prophecy.

One month in, long way to go

BYLINE: Kelly Whiteside

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 8C

LENGTH: 923 words

None of the 27 undefeated Division I-A teams want September to end, but alas the
first month is over. One thing is certain: The pool of unbeaten teams will
shrink after Saturday with six games between undefeated teams: No. 5 Florida at
No. 16 Alabama, No. 3 Virginia Tech at West Virginia, No. 13 Texas Tech hosts
Kansas, No. 19 Minnesota at Penn State, No. 17 Wisconsin hosts Indiana and Iowa
State at Nebraska. And, of course, No. 15 Arizona State (3-1) is eyeing the big
unbeaten, No. 1 USC. USA TODAY's Kelly Whiteside looks at the top September
story lines and what's ahead:

Youth movement

Suddenly, Joe Paterno has become the Pete Carroll of the East, 78 going on 18,
playing freshmen as if there's no tomorrow. Six true freshmen and 15 redshirt
freshmen have seen action in the Nittany Lions' first four games. The jewels of
last year's recruiting class, receiver Derrick Williams and receiver-corner
Justin King, have made an immediate impact. Williams is tied with redshirt
freshman Deon Butler for the team lead in receptions (11). Williams caught a
dramatic 36-yard touchdown pass with 51 seconds to play at Northwestern to give
the undefeated Nittany Lions a 34-29 victory. King had two long runs of 61 and
43 yards to set up scores against South Florida and Northwestern, respectively,
and a 59-yard TD catch against Cincinnati.


Coming off the Nittany Lions' fourth losing season in five years, the offense is
much improved. After finishing last year ranked 104th out of 117 Division I-A
schools, Penn State is No.28 in total offense, thanks in large part to its
big-play freshmen. The biggest Big Ten tests are to come, though, as the Nittany
Lions face No.19 Minnesota on Saturday, followed by No.8 Ohio State before
finishing against No.20 Purdue, No.17 Wisconsin and No.12 Michigan State.

Offensive offense

Bill Callahan's West Coast offense at Nebraska has looked positively Midwestern,
even though the Cornhuskers are off to a 3-0 start, thanks to a defense that has
more touchdowns (four) than the offense (three). The 'Huskers go into Saturday's
Big 12 opener against Iowa State 108th in passing and 107th in total offense.

Overpowering offense

Southern California's one-point-a-minute offense (59.3 average after three
games) means punter Tom Malone, one of the best in the country, is very, very
bored. He has punted three times this season.

Gamebreakers?

Much was made of multidimensional threats entering this season. The most hyped
-- Miami (Fla.)'s Devin Hester, Ohio State's Ted Ginn Jr. and Michigan's Steve
Breaston -- have flopped.

New coaches

There are 23 coaches new to their schools in Division I-A this season.

Three remain undefeated:

*Urban Meyer of Florida.

*Mike Gundy at Oklahoma State.

*Terry Hoeppner at Indiana.

One is winless:

*Hal Mumme at New Mexico State.

Best October games

Saturday: Florida at Alabama, Southern California at Arizona State, Michigan

at Michigan State, Virginia Tech at West Virginia.

Oct. 8: Oklahoma vs. Texas, Georgia at Tennessee, California at UCLA.

Oct. 15: USC at Notre Dame.

Oct. 22: Texas Tech at Texas.

Oct. 27: Boston College at Virginia Tech.

Oct. 29: Florida-Georgia in Jacksonville.

Most overrated

Two teams that began the season ranked in the top five of the USA TODAY Coaches'
Poll are out of the top 25: Michigan and Oklahoma. The Wolverines (2-2) were
ranked fourth in the preseason poll and are out of the top 25 for the first time
since the 1998 season. Preseason No.5 Oklahoma (1-2) is also unranked.
Louisville tumbled 14 spots to No.22 after a 45-14 loss to South Florida in its
first league game as a member of the Big East, the biggest upset of the young
season.

Most underrated

Among those unranked in the preseason, Michigan State is the highest ranked this
week at No. 12. Wisconsin and Minnesota also were overlooked. At the start of
the season, Ohio State, Michigan, Iowa and Purdue were the Big Ten favorites.
All but Ohio State lost their league openers.

Five Heisman hopefuls to watch

*Southern California's all-everything Reggie Bush: The most talented player in
the country would win if the season ended today.

*Southern California QB Matt Leinart: His teammate might spoil his chances for a
second Heisman Trophy.

*Texas QB Vince Young: If the Trojans stumble, Young's chances improve.

*Minnesota RB Laurence Maroney: Might be tough to pass the top three.

*Florida QB Chris Leak: If the Gators stay in the top five, so will Leak.

Easy teams to root for

*Tulane (1-1), displaced by Hurricane Katrina, now makes its home at Louisiana
Tech. The Green Wave are ranked No.1 in the nation in total defense, allowing
176 total yards a game. Last year they finished 93rd in the nation in total
defense. "We're not going to use being a homeless football team as a reason to
not try to succeed on the field," Tulane coach Chris Scelfo said.  The Green
Wave play a "home game" Saturday at LSU's Tiger Stadium in Baton Rouge against
Southeastern Louisiana.

*Vanderbilt has an excellent chance to be 5-0 after hosting Middle Tennessee
State on Saturday. The Commodores could be headed to their first bowl game since
1982. However, the toughest part of their schedule is ahead with home games
against LSU and Georgia in October and road tests at Florida and Tennessee in
November. But if the Commodores get to 5-0, a bowl trip seems like a good bet in
a year when they also play struggling Kentucky and South Carolina.

ASU Football Ends Saturday with Scrimmage

LENGTH: 517  words

DATELINE: New York



 Montgomery: Alabama State University has issued the following news release:



   The Alabama State University football team ended its second week of preseason
camp with a light scrimmage held at ASU Stadium in Saturday's second of two
practice sessions.





 The practice consisted of 10 drives in which the offense showed its dominance
of the day by scoring on five of those drives.



 On the first drive of the game the offense went 80 yards which was capped with
an eight yard touchdown run from Kenneth Thomas.



 It didn't take the offense long to score again as they went the same distance
on the third drive of the game which was capped off with a 22 yard touchdown
pass from Kobie Jones to Marlon Archer.



 "The offense look good and the defense didn't do so well," Head Coach Brian
Jenkins said.  "When your defense plays bad it makes the offense look even
better, but the offense did a good job and I commend them."



 Wrapped around the scoring the offense did have consecutive turnovers on the
fourth and fifth drives of the game.  The defense forced a fumble and then
Treyon Garnett was able to step in front of a pass and take the interception 35
yards for a defensive touchdown.



 "The offense had two turnovers which is a no-no and we gave up a couple of
quarterback sacks, so even though we looked good moving the ball there is still
a lot of work we have to do."



 The scrimmage also featured a lot of the young players as the coaching staff
dedicated this scrimmage to seeing what the younger players have been able to
learn in the first two weeks of camp.



 Freshman Jimmy Ferrell was able to throw two touchdown passes late in the
scrimmage, one from 25 yards out to Marquez Spencer and a 20 yard strike to
Johnnie Pope.



 The four touchdowns were wrapped around a 32 yard field goal off the foot of
David Albert.



 "We wanted to get a look at some of the young guys in live action and see how
they respond," Jenkins said.  "I'll tell you it is going to be a hard choice
making out that travel roster because some of those young guys really performed
and showed they are ready to play.  It was a good showing by our young guys I
can say that."



 Alabama State is now 21 days away from their season-opener on Sept. 3 when they
travel to Texas to play Texas-San Antonio.  And Jenkins is happy they have some
days left because there is still a lot to be done.



 "We are a work in progress," Jenkins said.  "We have seen some steady
improvement in some positions and we see some places we feel real good about.
But overall, we're still a work in progress and there's one thing I can say I'm
happy about and that is the effort of the football team.  They have given us
effort, and they are focused, they're trying to do everything we ask them to do
so on that end I'm very pleased."



 The Hornets will use Sunday to attend an area church together and will go
through team meetings and a short afternoon practice before hitting the field
for regular practice beginning Monday.

GEORGIA VS. FLORIDA: Cocktail coaches learn from experiences;
Spread offense spread too thin?

BYLINE: TONY BARNHART

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 1E

LENGTH: 594 words


Seven games, two losses, 93 incompletions and one teary-eyed press conference
into the Urban Meyer era, a lot of folks are fretting about Florida's offense.

Topping the list of worrywarts: the head coach himself.

"Disappointing," Meyer said from his office this week when asked about Florida's
offense --- or lack thereof. "But to think we were going to come into the SEC
and run the spread offense up and down the field the way we did at Utah ... I
knew that was not going to happen."

Even the most optimistic of Florida fans didn't think the Gators would average
45.3 points a game, like Meyer's Utah team did last season in the Mountain West
Conference. But they also never dreamed Meyer's offense would be so inept
against the SEC's top defenses.

Florida has faced three of the SEC's most stifling units in Tennessee (No. 4),
Alabama (No. 1) and LSU (No. 6). Florida had just one legitimate touchdown drive
in those games --- an 80-yarder against Tennessee. The other two scoring drives
--- both of 32 yards --- were set up by turnovers.

"There are some great defenses in this league," Meyer said. "And we're getting
ready to play another one [in Georgia]."

Fans had high preseason hopes for the Gators' offense, which featured SEC
passing leader Chris Leak, four senior starters along the line and one of
Florida's best group of wide receivers in years.

So what's the problem?

We asked three former SEC coaches --- Pat Dye, Gene Stallings and Jackie
Sherrill --- to assess what's behind Florida's offensive struggles:

* Reason No. 1: Leak isn't the right quarterback.

"It doesn't mean that Leak is a bad player. He's a good player," said Sherrill,
who coached Mississippi State from 1991-2003. "But he's not an option
quarterback and he doesn't have the speed to challenge a good SEC defense. To
run this offense, you need an exceptional athlete at quarterback, like Vince
Young at Texas. Leak is not that guy."

Leak, who has appeared uncomfortable with what he's being asked to do in this
offense, is coming off one of his worst games. He completed only 11 of 30 passes
for 107 yards against LSU. He also has taken a physical pounding.

* Reason No. 2: Meyer's offense lacks the power running game.

"You don't beat an SEC defense with screens and draws and just trying to trick
people," said Dye, who won four SEC titles at Auburn. "Sooner or later, in order
to win a championship, you have to line up jaw to jaw. You can run some option,
but you have to back that up with some kind of power running game."

"You can be a good team in this league without the quarterback under center and
the fullback behind him," said Stallings, who won a national title at Alabama.
"But you can't be a great team in the SEC if you can't run the ball and stop the
run. That has never changed."

* Reason No. 3: Meyer's offense is too much east-west and not enough
north-south.

"The SEC is different than most leagues because the best teams have large
defensive linemen who can really run," Sherrill said. "New coaches who are
unfamiliar with this league have to learn that. You can't outrun the best
defenses in this league. Your blockers have to hold them up and then you have to
run past them."

Meyer concedes that after watching Alabama beat Tennessee 6-3 last week, he's
beginning to understand the SEC better. There are indications his offense has
been tweaked during the off week.

"Our problems are more than execution because that would be putting all the
burden on the players, and that's not fair," he said. "My job is to adjust our
system and adapt it to the reality of our situation."

Ravens' offense ready for breakout;
Bills could be answer to end of struggles

BYLINE: Matt Zenitz Landmark News Service

SECTION: B; Pg.5

LENGTH: 548  words


When: Sunday, 1 p.m.

Records: Ravens 2-1; Bills 1-2

Line: Ravens by 3

OWINGS MILLS - The Ravens' offense remains a work in progress.

Baltimore has had some success offensively during the second half of each of the
last two games. But for the most part, the Ravens' offense has struggled through
the early part of this season, both in the passing game as well as in the
running game.

That said, this week's game against the Buffalo Bills presents as advantageous
of a matchup as Baltimore's offense has had this season and a potential
opportunity for the offense to break out some after underwhelming displays in
each of the first three games.

"We (just) need to start faster," Ravens coach John Harbaugh said, later adding,
"We'll try to start faster this week. That would be a good thing."

The Bills do have some talented defensive players on their roster - in
particular defensive end Mario Williams, cornerback Stephon Gilmore, free safety
Jairus Byrd and defensive tackles Marcell Dareus and Kyle Williams.

But Gilmore and Byrd are both yet to play this season because of injuries. And
despite the talent that Buffalo's defense has even without those players, the
Bills rank second-worst in the AFC in total defense.

Last week was a particularly poor showing for Buffalo.

Facing a New York Jets offense that is among the least talented offenses in the
league, the Bills gave up 513 yards of total offense and 27 points.

Rookie quarterback Geno Smith consistently exploited Bills cornerback Justin
Rogers and finished with 331 yards and two long touchdown passes, both of which
came on Rogers.

Rogers is a former seventh round pick who is filling in as a starter with
Gilmore sidelined.

But Rogers and the pass defense weren't the only issues for the Bills against
New York.

Little-known Jets running back Bilal Powell entered last week having rushed for
more than 58 yards in a game just once during his first two-plus years in the
NFL. He had 149 yards on 27 carries versus Buffalo.

The Bills played well defensively the week before, limiting the Carolina
Panthers to just 308 yards on offense, but the run defense in particular was a
problem for Buffalo in Week 1 as well.

Through three games, the Bills have allowed the second-most rushing yards in the
AFC, an average of 155 yards per game.

But the Ravens are confident about their offense even aside from anything to do
with the matchup with Buffalo.

The numbers aren't pretty, and Baltimore is third-worst in the league in total
offense, but the team has been happy with the play of quarterback Joe Flacco,
pleased with the continued development of wide receiver Torrey Smith and has
consistently voiced confidence that it still has the pieces to be an explosive
offense this season.

The Ravens didn't score a touchdown on offense during the first half of either
of their last two games, but the offense scored two touchdowns during the second
half against the Cleveland Browns and 13 points during the second half of last
week's win over the Houston Texans.

"I think we're coming along good," Ravens fullback Vonta Leach said. "We've
still got a ways to go to get to where we want to be at. But I think as long as
we keep on improving each and every week that we'll be all right."

PRO FOOTBALL;
Saints Are Marching, Redskins Are Racing

SECTION: Section B; Page 9; Column 1; Sports Desk

LENGTH: 795 words


Washington and New Orleans are on a course to collide in the National Football
Conference championship game. Through seven weeks of the season, the Redskins
have exhibited a stiff defense and the Saints a stifling one. The Redskins'
offense, however, has been potent while the Saints have patched together a
hit-and-miss attack.

That makes the Redskins the tougher team to topple.

The Redskins (7-0) have more balance -- the best in the league -- but the Saints
(6-0) have plenty of games left to work out their kinks on offense. In its 13-6
victory over Philadelphia on Sunday, New Orleans showed there is plenty of work
on offense left to be done. The offense was the beneficiary of six turnovers
supplied by the defense but managed only a touchdown and two field goals. Sure,
the Eagles' defense was inspired, but Washington's offense handled it
beautifully two weeks ago in a 23-0 victory.

Not only do the Redskins have more talent on offense but they also possess more
imagination. When comparing Washington Coach Joe Gibbs's offensive formations
and play-calling to the Saints Jim Mora's, what we have is a Corvette compared
to a Volkswagen.

"I don't think we're ever going to be accused of being fancy and outsmarting
ourselves," said Saints running back Dalton Hilliard. "When you've got the kind
of defense we do, there's no need to be fancy. You move the ball and you don't
force it. You let the defense work."

This philosophy is fine in the regular season, but the Saints might find that in
post-season play it could make them ripe for an upset. It happened to the Saints
after their 12-3 season in 1987 when they lost a first-round playoff game, at
home, to the Minnesota Vikings, 44-10. It happened to the Kansas City Chiefs
last year, a team heavy on defense and a little light on offense. They were
beaten by Miami, 17-16, in first-round playoff action.

Keith Jackson, the Eagles' All-Pro tight end, said it best in looking at New
Orleans:

"This team has a better defense than the Redskins, but not by that much. But the
Redskins have the better offense and therefore a better team. It would be an
intriguing match-up, but if I were the Saints, I'd want a whole lot more
firepower when I've got the ball. Hey, there's plenty of football to be played.
Six or seven games don't get you the N.F.C. championship game."

Washington and New Orleans each have an old nemesis to handle before even
thinking about a title game. After their bye week, the Redskins travel to Giants
Stadium to battle the Giants on Oct. 27. Washington has dropped six straight to
the Giants, and this game will be paramount for the Redskins' psyche. And New
Orleans meets the defending N.F.C. West champions, San Francisco, twice in a
three-week span beginning Nov. 10. New Orleans is 1-5 in its last six games
against the 49ers.

Prayers and Punches

A bizzare scene unfolded after the Saints-Eagles game at Veterans Stadium
Sunday. While several players were at midfield beginning to conduct a post-game
prayer, Saints receiver Eric Martin was racing round them and toward the Eagles'
tunnel in order to get at Philadelphia safety Andre Waters. A scuffle unfolded.

Martin refused comment afterward and Waters, who has long been labeled with a
reputation for late hits and dirty play, wasn't talking either. But this is what
happened according to Saints quarterback Bobby Hebert:

"The game is over; we're walking toward our tunnel. Waters comes up behind Eric
and throws and lands a nasty forearm, from behind, at his neck and then the guy
runs. Eric ran after him and when he caught him they fought. It was
unbelievable. And Waters wonders why people don't like him and he has the
reputation he has."

Jim Mora said, "I do not know what happened, but if what I am told is true, it
was a classless act."

McKyer's Revenge

Tim McKyer, the former 49er and Dolphin who is now an Atlanta Falcons
cornerback, talked a big game before the Falcons met San Francisco on Sunday.
McKyer remembered the practices every day against Jerry Rice and the other
speedy 49er receivers and promised he had learned his lessons well and would
show his old teammates.

He was beaten by Rice on a 57-yard score but made two interceptions. McKyer
thought he was mistreated by the 49ers before being traded to the Dolphins last
year -- he said the team wanted him to play injured when other 49er stars were
not asked to do the same. After the Falcons' 39-34 victory, he said his
performance in his return to Candlestick Park was one he will always remember.

"It was sweet revenge," McKyer said. "He got me, but I got the two interceptions
and we won the game. It's like I said all along -- they didn't know me or
appreciate what they had when I was there. Now maybe they do."

EYE ON ... COLT BRENNAN, QB, JR., HAWAII

BYLINE: John Henderson

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. DD-03

LENGTH: 465 words


Background: Colorado is having quarterback problems. Wonder how it would do if
it had the nation's top-rated passer? It could have. Hawaii's Colt Brennan
redshirted in Boulder in 2003. He had walked on after a lightly regarded career
at Mater Dei High School in Santa Ana, Calif., but never threw a pass. He was
accused of drunkenly barging into a woman's dorm room and unlawful sexual
contact in January 2004. Then-coach Gary Barnett kicked him off the team. "I
would've left voluntarily but Barnett wanted to make a statement and kicked me
off," Brennan said Wednesday from Honolulu. "I remember him getting praise. The
truth of the matter was, he didn't know if I was guilty or not guilty." A jury
convicted Brennan of felony burglary and trespassing but acquitted the
quarterback of sexual assault and indecent exposure. Prosecution on misdemeanor
sexual contact was vacated, meaning the charge has basically been dropped.
Brennan served seven days in jail and performed 60 hours of community service;
he is serving four years' probation. He transferred to Saddleback Community
College in Mission Viejo, Calif. Brennan was named the state's 2004 JC offensive
player of the year and signed with Hawaii.

Stat line: After leading the nation last year with 4,455 yards total offense and
35 touchdown passes, he leads again with 394.8 yards per game, a school-record
39 TD passes as well as passing efficiency at 190.00. He's fifth on ESPN's
Heisman list and, with four games and the Hawaii Bowl left, has a shot at David
Klingler's NCAA season mark of 55 TD passes set in 1990 at the University of
Houston.

What's up: Brennan gives as much credit to coach June Jones' run-and-shoot
offense, the improved offensive line and receivers as he does his right arm.
"This offense is designed for the quarterback to put up a ridiculous amount of
numbers," he said. "If you have a successful offense, the quarterback will be
successful." Plenty of Hawaii quarterbacks have put up big numbers. Timmy Chang
set the NCAA Division I-A mark with 17,072 yards from 2001-04 along with 117 TD
passes. However, he also threw an NCAA-record 80 interceptions. Brennan has 39
TD passes with six interceptions.

What's next: Hawaii (7-2, 5-1 WAC) hosts Louisiana Tech (3-6, 1-3) at 10 p.m.
MST Saturday.

Henderson's take: Brennan doesn't sound bitter about Colorado. While he didn't
use the best judgment during a time when Colorado players were being watched by
all, he does feel for the players he left behind as they go through this 1-9
season. "I love Colorado," Brennan said. "I loved going there and going to
school there. It hurts.

A lot of those guys, I'm friends with a lot of them. I want to see them do well.
Unfortunately, it's all put on the kids. It's not on the school or the
community. It's on the kids.''

THE GAME: COLTS' NO-HUDDLE OFFENSE IS NOTHING NEW, BUT ITS SUCCESS IS

BYLINE: Ed Bouchette, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. C-1

LENGTH: 786 words


As with the discovery of oil, the development of the no-huddle offense came
almost by accident. The scheme the Indianapolis Colts will use to defuse the
Steelers' aggressive defense came to life in Buffalo, N.Y., in 1990.

A quarterback from Western Pennsylvania was smack in the middle of it.

Marv Levy coached the Bills back then, and Jim Kelly was his quarterback. They
made the playoffs for the first time in seven years in 1988, but lost the AFC
championship in Cincinnati, where Bengals coach Sam Wyche confounded and angered
them by using a no-huddle offense.

Wyche's version -- an attempt either to catch teams in wrong defenses or in the
middle of a substitution -- later was rendered virtually illegal. The Bills,
however, made the playoffs again in 1989 and were hopelessly behind the Browns
in Cleveland.

"It was the fourth quarter, and we trailed by 19 points," Levy said the other
day. "I said, hell, we're not waiting, let's go to our two-minute drill. We
marched down and scored and then scored again. We got the ball for a third time
and marched down. We were trailing by four with five or six seconds left, and
Ronnie Harmon dropped the ball in the end zone."

During a staff meeting the next season, line coach Tom Breshnahan and
coordinator Ted Marchibroda asked Levy what he thought of opening their first
game with a two-minute drill.

"Are you guys reading my mind?" Levy responded.

To help make this circle complete, the Bills opened the 1990 season against the
Colts. They scored quickly and won, 26-10. "That's our offense," Levy and his
coaches proclaimed afterward.

Kelly, the kid from East Brady, loved the no-huddle.

"He loved it is right," Levy said. "He got to call his own plays and he was sort
of a swashbuckler."

The Bills played in four consecutive Super Bowls, and Kelly and Levy went into
the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

Today, the Colts hope to reach their first Super Bowl in 35 years with Peyton
Manning running the no-huddle offense as well as anyone since Kelly and the
Bills.

The idea of the hurry-up offense is to prevent a defense from all the multiple
substitutions made in the game today for various situations. Along the way, it
accomplishes other tasks. It keeps a defense off balance, makes players hurry
back to the line of scrimmage and get set and often thwarts the defense from
disguising blitzes and coverages, something the Steelers love to do.

"You never know when he's going to snap the ball," said Ken Whisenhunt, who, as
Steelers offensive coordinator, runs the hurry-up on occasion. "If you're trying
to disguise and he quick-snaps you, you're caught out of place."

That's why Manning can often take forever at the line of scrimmage, watching the
defense and calling audibles. If the defense shows its hand too early, Manning
can recognize it and switch to another play or protection scheme.

The Steelers love to blitz and were the only NFL defense to do so more than half
the time this season, according to Stats LLC, something the no-huddle offense
also helps to thwart. And Manning loves it when defenses blitz.

His 135.5 passer rating against the blitz the past two seasons is the best in
the league, again according to evaluators at Stats LLC, a company that tracks
and evaluates statistics for customers, including television networks.

It also helps to have a back such as Edgerrin James, who can run, catch and
block a blitzing linebacker. The Colts don't have to substitute as their down
and distance change because they have versatile skill players. Wyche's use of
the no-huddle in 1988 prompted a rule change that allowed a defense time to
substitute if an offense does. But there is no such rule if an offense does not
substitute.

"I think he's the one that hurt us the most," defensive end Aaron Smith said.
"If we shut down Edgerrin, we have a good chance to win that game. He made it a
two-headed day. We have to go out there and make them one-dimensional."

A no-huddle offense also can wear down a defense.

"You get to the point where you're not thinking mentally straight because you
are worried about getting back, getting lined up," Smith said. "You're not
thinking about the little things that go on."

Steelers defensive coordinator Dick LeBeau has to devise the schemes to stop
Manning and his offense. He had a first-hand look at the no-huddle offense in
Cincinnati when he was Wyche's defensive coordinator.

"I think there was more an advantage then than now because no one did it,"
LeBeau said. "They're keeping you from substituting. Manning's probably the best
that, if you try to substitute, he's going to catch you most of the time."

LeBeau, though, has found a surefire way to beat the no-huddle and the Colts.

"It still comes down to who plays the best."

West Coast offenses go back to Walsh, Gillman - and beyond

BYLINE: Gordon Forbes

SECTION: SPORTS; Pro Football; Pg. 8C

LENGTH: 644 words


Ask a half-dozen NFL coaches about the origin of the West Coast offense and get
a half-dozen answers.

Sure, it was Bill Walsh and that beautifully conceived offense in San Francisco.
Forget Walsh, it was Sid Gillman with those explosive San Diego teams of the
'60s. But what about the master, Paul Brown? And "Papa Bear" George Halas,
didn't he invent everything?

Walsh says the term came from quarterback Bernie Kosar.

"When Kosar went to the Cowboys," says Walsh, "he told me, 'They're using a lot
of West Coast stuff here.' But I'm not sure it represents what we've done. You
could be talking about the Chargers, the Raiders, anybody."

Anyway, Walsh claims the offense, with its distinctive quick drops and
spray-it-around passing, originated in Cincinnati in the '60s. It then moved to
San Diego and San Francisco when he moved.

The Bengals drifted through three quarterbacks, each with a unique style. "By
the time Kenny Anderson had it, we began to mature," Walsh recalled. "We had
Isaac Curtis, Bob Trumpy, Chip Myers and Charlie Joiner. We had a helluva
offense."

Gillman built his own offensive machine in San Diego.

Lance Alworth . . . Paul Lowe . . . Keith Lincoln . . . Ron Mix . . . Walt
Sweeney . . . John Hadl . . . Dickie Post . . . Gary Garrison. Gillman's
Chargers scored 450 points in 15games with their version of the West Coast
offense. In the '63 AFL title game, the Chargers drubbed Boston 51-10.

"You've got to have a quarterback who can read defenses and time the throw,"
says Gillman. "Basically, it's a short passing game."

Gillman is quick to deflect credit for the system. "If Bill Walsh says I got it
from Sid," says Gillman, "that's awfully nice of him."

On Oct. 26, Gillman turns 84, a time to enjoy fine dining and life on the golf
course. Gillman, however, prefers to analyze game tapes.

"I got the Raiders today, and Kansas City today," he said. "A few more will come
tomorrow. I'd hate like hell for something to happen out on the field that I
didn't know about."

Maybe that's why so many pro football minds can trace back to the short-pass
scheme that Kosar labeled the West Coast offense. They watched tapes and
borrowed rhythmic three-step and five-step drops. The five-receiver patterns and
the traps, quick draws and screens.

Walsh talks about subtle changes when he ran the Bengals' offense for Paul
Brown. "Each year we refined it, developed it and embellished it," says Walsh.
"We found ways to test every skill. Consequently, it became a complete offense."

So, who should take credit?

"There is some Sid Gillman football in it," Walsh noted. "Some Clark Shaugnessy
football in it. Some Blanton Collier football in it. Those three guys and my own
creativity, that's how it evolved."

Walsh, like Gillman, used a two-back set. He offset the short passing game with
a trap-and-sweep running game. "One year (1987) we (49ers) were the No. 1
rushing team (149.1-yard average) in the league," says Walsh. "It's a complete
offense."

At least six clubs use some form of the offense: 49ers, Chiefs, Broncos,
Packers, Eagles, Raiders. Gillmam says a lot more would be into the system with
better quarterbacks.

"What have you got, 30 teams?" asked Gillman. "Do we have 30 quarterbacks who
can take you to the Super Bowl? Listen, not 30, but 60 with injuries."

Why the trend?

Today's defenses take away the deep pass with small, quick cover guys and clever
blitz packages. The West Coast offense, with its five-receiver patterns, simply
counters the defensive speed.

Each offense, of course, has weaknesses. Five-receiver patterns invite pressure
and blitzes. Which is why you need a special quarterback who can make quick
decisions.

Five of the six West Coast teams won last week. The only loser was Denver,
beaten by the Cowboys, a team using some of that West Coast stuff, as Kosar once
said.

Herd to host C-USA title game

BYLINE: The Ironton Tribune, Ohio

SECTION: SPORTS

LENGTH: 511 words


Dec. 02--HUNTINGTON, W.Va. -- Marshall football (11-1) will host the Conference
USA Championship Game against Louisiana Tech (8-4) Saturday at noon ET in a
contest that will be televised on ESPN2, the league announced.

The Marshall Athletics ticket office will be open from 3-6 p.m. ET today for
walkup sales, and will call pickup.

The ticket office will be open from 8:30 a.m.-6:30 p.m. Monday through Friday in
the Cam Henderson Center. All ticket booths at Joan C. Edwards Stadium will open
at 9 a.m. on Saturday.

Student tickets are $5 with a valid MU ID and Marshall Maniacs are free.
Students may pick up tickets in the upper concourse level of the Cam Henderson
Center across from the Big Green offices.

All sideline tickets are $37 and end zone are $27.

Marshall has one of the nation's most prolific offenses, ranking seventh in
rushing offense (288.5 yards per game), second in total offense (574.6 yards per
game) and scoring offense (46.7 points per game), all figures that top C-USA.

Senior quarterback Rakeem Cato has passed for 3,314 yards and rushed for 429
this season (an average of 311.9 yards of total offense). He has also extended
his FBS record for consecutive games with a touchdown throw to 44.

Despite missing nearly two full games due to injury, junior RB Devon Johnson has
1,602 yards and 16 rushing TDs in 11 games. Johnson is among the FBS leaders in
total rushing yards, average (145.6) and scoring (9.8 per game).

Offensively, Louisiana Tech is led by junior RB Kenneth Dixon, who has run for
1,080 yards and scored 23 touchdowns (18 rushing), tied for the fourth-highest
single-season total in C-USA annals. Senior QB Cody Sokol is 239-of-400 passing
for 3,117 yards and 29 touchdowns.

Defensively, the Bulldogs lead the FBS with 36 forced turnovers and top the
nation with 150 points scored off turnovers.

Both teams are coming off amazing offensive performances to close out the
regular season. Louisiana Tech scored 76 points (one shy of the C-USA record)
and rolled up 677 yards of total offense, while Marshall scored 66 points and
generated 708 yards of total offense.

Louisiana Tech's Skip Holtz becomes the first head coach to lead two different
schools to the C-USA championship game. He led East Carolina to back-to-back C-
USA Championships in 2008-09.

Marshall's Doc Holliday is the fourth coach to lead his team to back-to-back
title gamesthat includes Holtz, UCF's George O'Leary and Tulsa's Todd Graham.

Marshall and Louisiana Tech have met just one time, on Oct. 9, 1942. The
Bulldogs posted a 26-0 shutout victory in Ruston, La., the third of four
consecutive shutouts LA Tech posted to open that season.

The Thundering Herd is aiming to become conference champions for the first time
since winning the Mid-American conference title in 2002. The Bulldogs have won
25 conference championships in their program's history, a number that ties for
11th among current FBS schools.

Meyer wants OSU to be more aggressive

BYLINE: Jim Naveau, The Lima News, Ohio

SECTION: SPORTS

LENGTH: 752 words


Sept. 21--COLUMBUS -- The lack of production by Ohio State's offense bothered
Urban Meyer. The turnovers bothered him.

But something else concerned him maybe just as much when he reviewed the
struggles of OSU's offense the last two games. He saw the Buckeyes playing
tentatively on offense.

The defense, the special teams and everyone else was playing with the
aggressiveness he expected. But he didn't see it from the offense.

The hunter looked it was being hunted. And that has to change, Meyer said at his
weekly press conference on Monday.

"We're playing defense on offense right now, and it's not working. So we're
going to take a more aggressive approach to how we go about our business," he
said.

"On offense right now, for a variety of reasons, we're sitting back and we're
not going to do that anymore. We recruit players to have explosive plays. We
give them opportunities to have explosive plays and over the last several years
for the majority, they made them.

"We're not doing that right now, so that's a high, high emphasis," he said,
looking ahead to Saturday's game against Western Michigan at Ohio Stadium.

No. 1 Ohio State's offense scored only one touchdown in a 20-13 win over
Northern Illinois last Saturday and was held to 298 yards total offense. The
week before, it scored only 17 points in the first 3  1/2  quarters before
exploding for three touchdowns in the final nine minutes of a 38-0 win over
Hawaii.

When Ohio State's coaches graded the films of the Northern Illinois game, 10 of
the 11 defensive starters met or exceeded the level required to be labeled a
champion for the game.

No one on offense did.

"It was a bunch of different things. We didn't play well. It's not the
quarterback. It's not the offensive line. We have to play better," Meyer said.
"If you look historically, what Ohio State offense is for us, it's control the
line of scrimmage, the best perimeter blocking in America and a very good, solid
play-action passing attack. That's not what's going on, so we're going to get
that fixed."

The most often suggested fix from the outside would be to resolve the
quarterback situation by giving either Cardale Jones, the starter in the first
three games, or last year's starter, J.T. Barrett, the keys to the offense for
the entire game.

While Meyer said he does not know yet if Jones will start on Saturday, he said
it is possible both will play again, as they have in OSU's first three games.

"There is not one who has beaten out the other and they're not playing well," he
said.

He also said it is incorrect to say he hasn't chosen a quarterback.

"Let's be clear. I did go with one guy. The guy (Jones) didn't perform well, so
we went with the back-up. There is no set thing saying that we're a
two-quarterback system, we're not. The back-up is a very good player, whomever
that may be," Meyer said.

"I expect a much better performance Saturday from our guys. I wish we could play
tomorrow," he said.

NOTES:

-- TOO MANY TURNOVERS: Meyer called Ohio State's five turnovers (three
interceptions, two fumbles) against Northern Illinois "absolutely inexcusable."

Jones threw two interceptions before he was replaced early in the second quarter
by Barrett, who threw another interception.

Ezekiel Elliott and Curtis Samuel lost fumbles.

--ELLIOTT'S WORKLOAD: Ezekiel Elliott carried the ball 27 times against Northern
Illinois and 23 times against Hawaii, but there have been questions if he is
being used enough

Running backs coach Tony Alford says he doesn't understand why those questions
are being asked.

"I don't think we came in with a target that he had to carry so many times.
We're going to do what we have to do to win football games. He's doing fine. If
someone says he isn't carrying enough, I can't answer that."

--WEBER UPDATE: Freshman running back Mike Weber will not make his debut this
week.

Weber had surgery for a torn meniscus during preseason camp. Last Monday, Meyer
said he might play against Northern Illinois but later in the week said he would
not play.

--MORE PLAYING TIME: Defensive back Damon Webb, who was suspended indefinitely
last Saturday, was the player who went into the game in situations where Ohio
State played five defensive backs.

His suspension means that Cameron Burrows and Marshon Lattimore will get more
playing time when OSU uses five defensive backs.

PRO FOOTBALL;
The Giants' Offense Is Fooling No One

BYLINE: By MIKE FREEMAN

SECTION: Section B;  Page 13;  Column 1;  Sports Desk

LENGTH: 667 words

DATELINE: EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J., Oct. 14


One play in the first half on Sunday probably symbolized what is wrong with the
Giants and their offense. The Eagles blitzed out of a three-man front, sending
seven players at quarterback Dave Brown. Coach Dan Reeves warned his players
about this strategy last week and the offense practiced against it, albeit
sparingly.

The problem for the Giants came when the Eagles made an adjustment that
completely confused them. The Philadelphia coaches felt the Giants would prepare
for only one look out of that three-man alignment, so they tried a different
look -- with different personnel -- which they had not used all season.

Caught off guard, the Giants were forced to make four different adjustments as
Brown frantically tried to move personnel to cover the impending blitz. But the
Eagles had overloaded the side and it was almost impossible to pick up each man.
Brown was hammered to the turf -- one of eight Philadelphia sacks -- and the
Giants eventually lost, 19-10.

True, the Giants had practiced for a three-man front, but the repetitions were
so limited there was no way they could consistently defend against it. Plus,
there is the feeling that one of the Giants' biggest problems is that they do
not have a base offense. They just pile on plays based on the opposition that
week. Many teams like to have a group of plays to counter something an opposing
team is doing, a group of plays they have practiced over and over since training
camp. If the Eagles used that three-man front, for example, other teams might
have countered with a screen or some other quick play in their arsenal.

But the Giants counter with specific plays they worked on that week, plays the
players have had a limited time to practice. Many times they end up not working.

The Giants' offense has been a disaster this season. It has been successful in
spots, but the coaches' game plans have been erratic at best and extremely
predictable. The Eagles' players said after the game that many times they knew
what the Giants were going to do and were not fooled by any of Brown's
play-action fakes. The Eagles were not the first to make such comments.

The offensive struggles led to finger-pointing after the game, with defensive
players being extremely upset with the offense. Linebacker Corey Widmer said 3
points is "not going to cut it."

H-back Aaron Pierce said today that he cannot blame the defense for being
peeved.

"I would say the defense has a right to be upset," Pierce said. "The offense was
trying, but we weren't getting the job done. I can't blame them. We were pretty
bad."

The state of the offense -- in particular how poor the line has played -- has
again led Reeves to speculate that personnel changes on the offense might be in
order.

"We'll evaluate everything," he said.

Reeves has said this before and no changes have been made, partly because he has
few options. He could start the backup Lance Smith at one of the guard positions
or perhaps move Ron Stone to right tackle. Or he could bench Brown and start
Stan White. But would those changes really help? And aren't the Giants' problems
deeper than inserting a backup lineman?

But you cannot blame Reeves for wanting to try something, anything, to get the
30th-ranked passing offense cranking. The Giants have scored 21 points in the
second halves of games this season, or about 3 1/2 points a game. And you cannot
blame Brown if he is a little jittery in the pocket and, as Reeves said, not
trusting of the protection. Reeves said Brown was rattled after the first sack.

Brown, who has been sacked 26 times, is on pace for a 70-sack season. The
National Football League record is 72, set by Randall Cunningham in 1986. In
1985 Ken O'Brien, the former Jet quarterback, was sacked 62 times and St.
Louis's Neil Lomax was sacked 61 times. Brown could easily shatter some of those
records.

Those numbers are inexcusable and a big reason the offense has broken down. If
it isn't fixed, and soon, things will only get worse.

PRO FOOTBALL;
Look Toward Green Bay to See Jets' Failings

BYLINE:  By JUDY BATTISTA

SECTION: Section D; Column 1; Sports Desk; Pg. 13

LENGTH: 896 words


Jets fans who watched "Monday Night Football" saw something they had been
looking for all season. In the third quarter, Green Bay receiver Bill Schroeder
broke toward the middle on a quick slant. Brett Favre took a three-step drop,
hit Schroeder in stride with a short pass and Schroeder was gone for a 41-yard
touchdown.

Was that a sighting of the West Coast offense? It was, and next Monday night the
Jets -- who, at least in name, run a West Coast offense, too -- play San
Francisco, the mother team of the hallowed offense that nearly half the league
now employs.

When Mike Holmgren moved from offensive coordinator of the San Francisco 49ers
to head coach of the Green Bay Packers in 1992, he imported the West Coast
offense to Lambeau Field, where it has been run since.

The Jets, with the new offensive coordinator, Paul Hackett, orchestrating the
transition, have run the West Coast offense for all of six months, and the
growing pains are plentiful, and those quick slants are not. New England Coach
Bill Belichick bitingly said before last Sunday's game that the Jets' new-look
offense looks an awful lot like the old one: lots of Curtis Martin runs,
interrupted by swing passes to Martin and Richie Anderson, with a few tosses to
the wide receivers sprinkled in.

The result has been an offense that has been no more tantalizing than last
season's and one that ranks 21st in the league in total yards per game and 27th
in passing yards per game. Against the Indianapolis Colts in the season opener,
only eight passes were directed to the wideouts. On Sunday against New England,
13 passes were thrown to the wideouts, with 9 being completed. Only Martin has
saved the Jets' offense from disaster; it ranks seventh in the league in rushing
yards per game.

Hackett said before the season that it could take about four games for the Jets
to have a good idea of where they stand with the offense. Martin has an early
diagnosis.

"This offense is like a radio station when you're trying to tune it in," he
said. "It's getting closer and you finally tune it in and you can hear the song.
Right now, we're not right there -- there's still a little static. You can hear
the words and you can hear the melody, but that sound irritates you. That's
where I feel we are. It's so irritating you turn to a different station. Of
course, we're not going to change stations."

Coach Herman Edwards would certainly agree with that, but the Jets are taking on
a strangely Tampa Bay feel: a fierce defense and a moribund offense. That,
Edwards said, was intentional against the Colts, because the Jets wanted to run
the ball and eat the clock to keep the Colts' explosive offense off the field.
But against the Patriots, the Jets had hoped to open up the passing game. They
tried, sometimes, to shake things up. Laveranues Coles made a circus catch for a
44-yard gain in the second quarter, but Martin was called for a chop block and
the play came back. This is not a trend Edwards is comfortable with. He sweated
through plenty of 6-3 games in Tampa and does not seem to have the stomach for
them now.

"I'd like to score points," he said. "I'm not going to tell you I want a
defensive game. One go route we threw, we caught it. It got called back. Three
others were dialed up, but they called a coverage and we had to switch. You have
to hope you get the right coverage. It's not like we didn't take our shots. This
is a league where you're not going to hit go routes all day. We want to throw
them, but people can roll up on you or blitz."

The Jets had particular problems on offense in the fourth quarter, when they got
only one first down and were 0 for 5 on third downs. The Patriots blitzed in
those situations, and packed seven or eight defenders close to the line of
scrimmage, daring the Jets to throw. Of those five fourth-quarter situations,
Vinny Testaverde twice attempted to throw to Martin and Anderson (both were
incomplete), twice threw to Wayne Chrebet (one was incomplete, the other was
complete but short of the first down) and once handed off to Martin, who had no
gain.

"Although this is a West Coast offense, we also have incorporated things we did
in the past, which we feel was very good," Testaverde said. "Yes, we'd like to
be more explosive, score more points, be more consistent. One is the players
getting more confident and comfortable. Two, the coaches are getting more
confidence in our ability to perform in the system. That's coming. There were
just a couple of plays, if we can make those plays, it's a different ballgame
and it doesn't look so ugly, offensively speaking."

After the Niners, the Jets face the struggling Buffalo Bills. Both games are
entirely winnable, even if the offense shows only incremental progress. Hackett
also said before the season that it could take up to three years for an offense
to master the West Coast system. That is an extended timetable that the Jets --
with Martin in his prime and Testaverde near the end of his career -- can not
afford.

"For one, it's a difficult offense," Martin said. "And we're creatures of habit.
We almost have to make mistakes for us to learn to do it differently. When
you're changing the entire offense, everything you used to call something, they
call it something else. You have to relearn that before you can play like it's
part of you. It takes some time for it to become natural."

GONZALEZ A RAIDERS RIDDLE

BYLINE: JOHN RYAN, Mercury News

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 13D

LENGTH: 619 words


New quarterback Trent Green knows the Kansas City offense, which is really the
St. Louis offense, which was the Washington offense, which came from the Dallas
dynasty offense, which originated with the "Air Coryell" San Diego offense.

That old link to the Chargers is the key to the Chiefs' success today -- and
this season. The attack will fit around tight end Tony Gonzalez, not the other
way around.

"This offense, when it first went in, was with Kellen Winslow out in San Diego,"
Green said. "And then Norv Turner, after a couple years, took it to Dallas and
had a lot of success with Jay Novacek. So the tight end can be a very big part
of this offense. . . . This is getting back to the fundamentals of what this
offense originally was."

Even without Green's historical perspective, Gonzalez led NFL tight ends with 93
catches for 1,203 yards and nine touchdowns last season. The receptions set a
club record for any player and fell three short of the NFL record for a tight
end (Ben Coates, 1994 Patriots is the trivia answer).

Gonzalez did much of his damage against the Raiders, racking up two of his six
100-yard games. But the Raiders found a glimmer of hope in his seven-catch,
100-yard effort Oct. 15 in Kansas City. Gonzalez had six catches, including a
touchdown, in the first half. At 6-foot-4 and 248 pounds, he outweighed
linebacker William Thomas by more than 20 pounds. In the second half, the
Raiders deployed backup Bobby Brooks, who is 6-2 and 245 and has good speed for
that size. Brooks is reluctant to take credit, but teammates and coaches know
the role he played.

"We had to hammer him, because if you let him get a free release, it's almost
like letting Tim or Jerry get off the ball," Brooks said, comparing Gonzalez to
Brown and Rice.

In Oakland a month later, Gonzalez caught nine passes for 134 yards. He lined up
in the backfield, at wide receiver and anywhere else. The Raiders, like the rest
of the league, didn't have an answer. The fifth-year man from Cal is so far
ahead of the game that he outperformed his nearest competitors at tight end by
22 catches and 393 yards.

"He's a spectacular tight end," Raiders Coach Jon Gruden said. "I don't call him
a tight end. I just call him a Tony Gonzalez."

CHART:
RAIDERS' KEYS TO THE GAME
Playing keep-away: "If we don't turn the ball over, we win this game no
problem," Raiders receiver Tim Brown says. The Raiders did not lose when they
won or tied the turnover battle last season; they were 0-4 when they lost in
that category. Chiefs defensive coordinator Greg Robinson held the same post in
Denver for six years; in that time his players forced 33 Raiders turnovers, the
biggest reason Denver was 11-1 in the series.
A big play for D.A.? The Chiefs' Derrick Alexander finished seventh in the NFL
with 1,391 receiving yards last season; in Oakland, he had nine catches for 139
yards and two touchdowns.
Getting to the altar: The Raiders need to stuff the Chiefs' new tailback, Priest

 Holmes, on first and second down, if only to have a better idea of where Tony
Gonzalez will be on third down.
Line 'em up, knock 'em down: The Raiders return the entire line  in front of
last year's NFL rushing leaders, who beat up the Chiefs for 5.4 yards a carry
last season.
The Trace chase: Against the Chiefs' spread attack, pass-rushing specialist
Trace Armstrong could see much more time than he normally would. The one
weakness of Chiefs QB Trent Green is lack of mobility.

Couple accused of lynching

BYLINE: Compiled by Gerrie Ferris

SECTION: NATIONAL NEWS; Pg. 08C

LENGTH: 308 words


A white couple is charged with second-degree lynching for allegedly tying a
9-year-old black boy to a tree, shooting a gun past his head and tying a belt
around his neck until he passed out.

Benjamin and Betty Mims each posted a $ 5,000 bond and were released from the
Clarendon County, S.C., jail. They told authorities they believed the boy was
stealing from their truck. Eventually freed, the boy was told not to tell anyone
what happened or his family would be killed and his house burned, the sheriff's
department said. The couple could face 20 years in prison.

KENTUCKY

BLOWING THE WHISTLE: Jeffrey Wigand, the tobacco industry whistleblower who gave
"60 Minutes" an interview that never aired, has had past troubles with the law,
according to WHAS-TV in Louisville. The station reported that Wigand was charged
with shoplifting after a $ 13 bottle of whiskey was found in his pocket. He also
spent time in jail on domestic violence charges.

MISSISSIPPI

EXPENSIVE JUSTICE: Mississippi lawmakers' zeal to fight crime may put the state
in the poorhouse, prisons chief Steven Puckett warned. The blame mainly goes to
the year-old truth-in-sentencing law, which requires all convicts to serve 85
percent of sentences, no matter the crime. The state's three prisons are full,
and 2,410 inmates are being held in county jails. Puckett estimates the number
of inmates will increase 152 percent, from 12,294 to 31,031, by 2005.

NORTH CAROLINA

JORDAN TRIAL: On the day basketball star Michael Jordan's father was killed,
Daniel Andre Green called his brother five times from the dead man's car phone.
Green's brother, David Moore, testified that he did not know where his brother
was calling from on July 23, 1993. The district attorney used the records to
show the calls were made from James Jordan's red Lexus coupe.

Final dress rehearsal for Patriots offense

BYLINE: By David Pevear, dpevear@lowellsun.com

LENGTH: 561 words


Will this third preseason game provide a glimpse into the might of this Patriots
offense?

You know, just to reassure us.

Or must we go on presuming this Patriots offense will roll instinctively when
the games turn real, because, hey, that's Tom Brady out there.

One suspects Brady, who did not dress for Monday night's 27-17 preseason loss to
the Philadelphia Eagles in Foxboro, will work up a sweat Friday night against
the Tampa Bay Buccaneers at Raymond James Stadium (and hopefully not by feeling
from seepage caused by Nate Solder and Marcus Cannon).

The Patriots' QB par excellence took 19 uninspiring snaps in the preseason
opener 15 days ago, a 7-6 victory over the New Orleans Saints that featured zero
points by the first offense and Brady being strip-sacked by Will Smith.

That night Brady signaled where he felt the Patriots' heralded offense stood at
that point. He slammed his helmet on the ground.

On Wednesday, Brady said "the goal is to be ready and prepared when we need to
be."

Traditionally, the third preseason game is the dress rehearsal for the
first-teamers. They often work into the third quarter. Then, during the final
preseason game, they rest while the lower end of the roster claws for roster
spots.

New England's final preseason game next Wednesday in New York is still 10 days
before the Sept. 9 regular-season opener in Tennessee.

The first mandatory cut-down is Monday; NFL teams must trim their rosters to a
maximum of 75 players. The final cut-down to 53 is next Friday.

Brady has relied on practice-practice-practice to familiarize himself with new
weapons such as wide receiver Brandon Lloyd.

"Coach (Bill) Belichick has been through this quite a bit and so have I," said
Brady. "So I'm sure when the time comes to play, we'll be as prepared as we can
possibly be."

Wide receiver Wes Welker did not practice Thursday. That would seem to indicate
Welker will sit out Friday. He also did not play Monday against the Eagles.
Brady and Welker can probably get back up to speed quickly, as the 554 passes
Welker has caught over the last five seasons suggest. The Brady-Lloyd connection
is in early development. It will be interesting to watch it Friday.

Of course, should offensive tackles Solder and Cannon's shaky play continue,
optimism, could be seriously undermined, since Brady's completion percentage
while being knocked down is not particularly good.

"They're doing their job, and I have to worry about my job," Brady said
Wednesday when asked about the offensive line. "I think part of what our team
has always been built on is guys having trust in each other to do what they need
to do to be competitive, and that's what we're trying to do out here in
practice."

Pro Bowl guard Logan Mankins (knee) returned to practice last week and tackle
Sebastian Vollmer (back) did this week. Will we get to see Mankins and Vollmer
Friday night?

What about running back Jeff Demps, the Olympic silver-medalist sprinter (4x100
relay) signed last week as a rookie free agent out of Florida, who is being
counted on to thrill us on kick returns?

"The coaches have done a great job of slowly working (Demps) in," said wide
receiver Deion Branch. "He's just come from London, doing a great job for our
country, and the last thing they want to do is just throw him out there to the
wolves. That's not the right thing."

RAIDERS' OFFENSE ALL ABOUT BROWN CAMP: RECEIVER KEY IN GRUDEN'S PLAN.

BYLINE: RON BERGMAN, Mercury News Staff Writer

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 4D

LENGTH: 617 words

DATELINE: ALAMEDA


The Raiders gave new meaning to the term March Madness by opening mini-camp
Friday and declaring this Tim Brown's team.

Not only that, but new Coach Jon Gruden began installing an attack that will
abandon the 90-yard pass from anywhere on the field to something that resembles
the West Coast offense.

"We're going to throw deep," Gruden said, just in case owner Al Davis had the
press room bugged. "We're running the Oakland Raider offense, the East Bay
offense, the Silver and Black attack.

"Tim Brown's team means he is our leader, the leader of our offense, a spokesman
for our team. We can't force the ball into anyone. We have to be smart about how
we get the ball to him. He wants to see the ball a lot, like any great player."

Said quarterback Jeff George: "Definitely, this offense is Timmy Brown's. You
look at teams that run this offense and there's one guy that just stands out.
You focus your offense on that guy. This offense allows him to do what he does
best, read coverages and get open."

Showing commitment

George and Brown showed their commitment to Gruden by being among those
attending this volunteer camp. Let's face it, in Brown's case, if this was your
team, you'd show up, too, just to make sure no one steals your football.

"Jon has told me from Day One that he's going to build this offense around me,"
Brown said with noticeable pride. "And he's going to depend on me being out
there play in and play out.

"For once, I may be the center point of the offense. I don't think I've been
that in the past. Jon has said that time after time in meetings."

In the past, it has been said the Raiders were too dependent on Brown, a
seven-time Pro Bowl receiver. Now that they're even more dependent, Brown seems
willing to share with his teammates.

"It's basically the same thing we did back in 1995 when (former quarterback
coach) Jim Fassel was here," Brown said. "We have a deeper team as far as talent
now.

"(Tight end) Rickey Dudley can run after the catch better than anyone at his
position. James Jett seems to be going deep all the time, but in reality he's
running 20-yard hooks or 20-yard comebacks. With me we'll have the opportunity
to have me do what I do best: Get the ball in my hands and let me run with the
ball."

No problem with Gruden

Brown and Gruden appeared to be getting along despite Brown's published comment
that he wanted former Coach Art Shell to return.

"Everybody was saying that I didn't want Jon here but that's not what I said,"
Brown said. "I was asked who I'd be more comfortable with and I said Art Shell
because I knew Art Shell. Everything got misconstrued.

"Jon knew exactly what I was talking about. We talked about it for a half a
minute and moved on to, 'How do we get this team back to the playoffs and back
to the big game?' That's why I'm here in March hurting myself. I want to show
everybody I'm serious."

Brown also showed he was serious about the Raiders by signing an extension that
adds three years to his contract after this season. He could have turned 1998
into an option year and forced a trade to prevent him from walking away as a
free agent with nothing in return.

'Another shot'

"If I had walked out of here after a 4-12 season, it would have been the
equivalent of a dog walking away with his tail stuck between his legs," Brown
said. "I didn't want anyone to remember Tim Brown as a guy who, when things
really got bad, jumped ship.

"I wanted to give it another shot. I speak for most of the older guys who have
been here for a while, that most of them want to see this thing righted. I want
to finish my career here, but if that doesn't happen, I can say that I gave it
another shot."

REGION IN BRIEF;
Using shame as punishment

BYLINE: Compiled by Gerrie Ferris

SECTION: NATIONAL NEWS; Pg. 03B

LENGTH: 566 words


Petty theft? Publish an advertisement with photo admitting the crime. Sex
offense? Post a notice on the front door warning children to stay away. So ruled
a Fort Pierce, Fla., judge.

Circuit Judge Larry Schack hasn't required a woman accused of adultery to wear
an "A" on her chest, like in the Nathaniel Hawthorne novel "The Scarlet Letter,"
but his imagination is not lacking. In fact, he says he is thinking of making
shame a regular thing and wrote a memo last week to prosecutors and public
defenders listing some ideas - like wearing a T-shirt advertising the offense.

The latest subject for shame was Kenneth Boatwright, who pleaded guilty last
week to a charge of felony petty theft. He had 14 prior convictions. Boatwright
got nine months in jail and was told that after getting out he must place an ad
in a local newspaper with his photograph declaring: "I am a convicted thief."

SOUTH CAROLINA Voice of youth

In just a few hours, South Carolina's student legislators decided what adult
lawmakers have been wrangling about for years - whether the Confederate battle
flag should be moved from atop the Statehouse. Their verdict: Take it down, not
just from atop the Statehouse but from the House and Senate chambers. The 1,200
high school students gathered last week for the annual Model Legislature and
Court conference of the YMCA Youth in Government of South Carolina. After much
talk of heritage and racism, history, symbolism, pride and unity, the bill to
keep the flag flying failed by an overwhelming voice vote.

FLORIDA Vampire cultists

A teenager, shackled hand and foot, stood listlessly in court as a judge in
Ocala ordered her and three fellow "vampire clan" members held without bail in
the bludgeoning death of her parents. Heather Wendorf, 15, of Eustis and three
teens from Kentucky were given court-appointed attorneys and ordered held by
juvenile authorities in the Nov. 25 death of Richard Wendorf, 49, and his wife
Naoma "Ruth," 53. Police say the teens, caught up in a fantasy vampire game that
mushroomed into a role- playing cult, cut their arms and drank each other's
blood. They are accused of beating the Wendorfs to death in their Eustis home
about 30 miles northwest of Orlando, and stealing the couple's car to get to New
Orleans.

ALABAMA Trial dates set

Trial dates have been set for next spring for a Russellville couple charged with
capital murder in the disappearance and presumed death of the man's 5-year-old
daughter. Paul Gonzalez will be tried April 7 in Troy and his wife, Kim
Gonzalez, will be tried May 19 in Greenville. They are accused of killing Andrea
Gonzalez in November 1993 and throwing her body in Upper Bear Creek Lake.

Buck stops there

A Birmingham police officer refused to give Gov. Fob James preferential
treatment last week, slapping $ 10 tickets on a pair of illegally parked cars
being used by the governor. The state trooper and the governor's aide who were
driving the cars will pay the fines out of their own pockets.

MISSISSIPPI Bears and the bees

Some Mississippi beekeepers consider Louisiana black bears a top enemy and are
at odds over efforts to restore the federally protected bears. The Mississippi
Beekeepers Association has pulled out of the Black Bear Conservation Committee,
which has been working to boost bears' numbers in Mississippi, Louisiana and
East Texas.

Raiders make change on offense

BYLINE: By Steve Corkran, MEDIANEWS STAFF

SECTION: SAN MATEO; Raiders; Sports

LENGTH: 714 words


Raiders coach Art Shell reassigned offensive coordinator Tom Walsh to coach the
tight ends and promoted tight ends coach John Shoop to offensive coordinator for
the remainder of the season, the Raiders confirmed in a release Tuesday
afternoon.

Oakland's offense is ranked last in points scored, yards per game and passing
yards per game through 11 games.

"In this business, at times there are tough decisions that have to be made for
the good of the football team," Shell said in the release. " ... Tom has been
diligent in his effort to get our offense going in the right direction. In no
way should the lack of a more successful offense be placed totally at his feet."

Shell hired Walsh soon after he got hired to replace the fired Norv Turner in
February. Walsh was running a bed-and-breakfast in Swan Valley, Idaho, where he
also was the mayor, when Shell called to offer him the job.

Walsh was Shell's offensive coordinator with the Raiderswhen both got fired
after the 1994 season.

Shoop, 37, has spent the past two seasons with the Raiders. He was their
quarterbacks coach last season but got demoted by Shell after a disagreement in
offensive philosophy during an off-season meeting.

Shoop was the offensive coordinator for the Chicago Bears from 2001-03 but got
fired after the Bears went from 13-3 his first season to 4-12 in '02 and 7-9 in
'03. Things deteriorated so badly that fans create Web sites calling for Shoop's
firing.

Shoop was the quarterbacks coach for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2004.

The Raiders have averaged only 12 points a game this season. In five games their
offense failed to score a touchdown. They have only 132 points, 35 in the second
half.

Backup quarterback Andrew Walter has been openly critical of Walsh's
play-calling, saying there aren't enough "quick-hitters" and short stuff and
that many of his plays take too long to develop. As a result, he said, he and
Aaron Brooks are more susceptible to being sacked.

Several former players and coaches have called Walsh's offense the worst they
have seen. Former Raider quarterback Rich Gannon said this month in a story in
the Kansas City Star that, "It's as bad an offense as I've seen in a long, long
time in the NFL. Maybe ever."

Running back LaMont Jordan this season said the Raiders offense is talented but
disjointed.

"We have this so-called high-power offense, we have so many weapons," Jordan
said. "What we have to do is, we have to go out there and perform."

Shell has backed Walsh all season. However, the pressure has mounted from within
the organization for Shell to make a change.

"When the offense struggles, I take it harder than Tom," Shell said Nov.7. "And
Tom takes it very hard when we don't do things. But there's so much involved in
why the offense doesn't work. There's so much involved that people can't see, or
people don't understand. ... I really don't have to defend Tom because I feel
worse than he does when we don't succeed offensively."

The Raiders averaged 18.1 points per game last season, with most of the same
players on this season's offense. This year's team is on pace for 192 points. No
Raiders team has scored fewer than 213 points in a full season, and that came
during a 14-game season in 1962.

EXTRA POINTS: The Raiders placed veteran long-snapper Adam Treu on the
injured-reserve list as a result of the quadriceps injury he sustained against
the San Diego Chargers on Sunday. He is out for the rest of the season. Treu,
32, is the longest-tenured Raider. He joined the team in 1997 and has appeared
in all 162 regular-season and postseason games during his 10-year career.
Starting center Jake Grove replaced Treu as the snapper on punts, extra-point
and field-goal attempts in the second half of the Chargers game. Coach Art Shell
said Grove is expected to handle double duty the rest of the season. The Raiders
signed rookie center Chris Morris from their practice squad to take Treu's spot
on the 53-man roster. He was the first of Oakland's two selections in the
seventh round of the NFL draft in April. He, too, has some long-snapping
experience. ... The Raiders cut rookie quarterback Kent Smith from their
practice squad. He was with the Raiders during training camp but got cut before
the regular-season opener. He rejoined the Raiders after the season started.

Longhorns notebook

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. C08

LENGTH: 632 words


One and the same

The Longhorns prepared for Arkansas - then stopped . Now they're preparing for
Rice. Next week they'll prepare for Arkansas again.

Is it difficult for Texas? Not really.

"It'll just be better the next week because we've already prepared. We'll have
an extra week of preparation for (Arkansas)," Texas quarterback Colt McCoy said
. "You just have to put that in the back of your mind and focus on Rice now.

"It won't be too bad because Rice and Arkansas do a lot of the same things
defensively. They kind of have the same structure. We'll get to play that two
weeks in a row."

The two teams have similar offenses, too.

"Rice has a good spread offense. They've got a good quarterback and wide
receiver," UT cornerback Ryan Palmer said. "The good thing is their offense is
similar to Arkansas', so it's not like we're learning a whole new offense and
then going back to a different one next week."

Center Chris Hall had his typical take on the situation.

"I just want to thank the Lord for having us face two similar defenses in a
row," he said with a smile.

'Mumbles' the word

Offensive tackle Adam Ulatoski isn't the most talkative person in the world.

"He's quiet," receiver Quan Cosby said. " Real quiet."

So quiet that he's earned a nickname from coach Mac McWhorter.

"He's a veteran lineman. He's a typical lineman who has played a bunch of
games," offensive coordinator Greg Davis said. "He's real quiet. There's a
reason that coach McWhorter calls him 'Mumbles.'"

Horns notice offense

With the weekend off, a lot of Texas players sat in front of the television and
watched their Big 12 foes take the field. The Longhorns took notice.

"They do have great offenses," defensive end Brian Orakpo said of the
conference. "Every time you turn on the tube, someone's putting (a lot of points
on the board) ."

The conference has five of the nation's top 10 scoring offenses, including No. 1
Missouri (57.67 points per game), No. 3 Kansas State (57.0), No. 5 Oklahoma
(54.67), No. 6 Oklahoma State (50.67) and No. 10 Texas (47.0).

The Big 12 also has some of the countries' worst pass defenses, including No. 91
Colorado (245), No. 98 Texas (261), No. 103 Nebraska (269.7), No. 105 Texas Tech
(272.7) and No. 109 Missouri (297).

Rice stuck

The Rice team was stranded in Nashville on Sunday. With Houston still trying to
recover from Hurricane Ike, the Owls tried to do what they normally would - but
in Tennessee instead of Texas.

Players studied. Coaches started preparing for the Texas game .

The Owls got on a 2 p.m. flight Monday and were able to get back to Houston
around 4:30 p.m. But there were still questions about how things were going to
work.

While the school has electricity, many of the football players live in
off-campus housing.

The team didn't know which players would have power, if there was any flooding
or broken windows. While football might be on the mind of Texas, the Owls were
more worried about finding housing and water for everybody.

But the Owls weren't feeling sorry for themselves.

"I think everybody understands that what we're dealing with doesn't really
compare to what a lot of other people in Houston are going through ," Owls
spokesman Chuck Pool said.

Weis has seen this D before

BYLINE: By ERIC HANSEN; Tribune Staff Writer

LENGTH: 818 words


SOUTH BEND -- Charlie Weis didn't have to pore over hours of Syracuse film to
know where Orange head coach Greg Robinson might be coming from Saturday from a
defensive standpoint.

But the Notre Dame first-year head coach, of course, did it anyway.

The two faced each other four times as NFL coordinators -- Weis on offense,
Robinson on defense -- over the past several years, most recently in 2002 (a
41-38 victory for Weis and New England over Kansas City), with Weis holding a
3-1 edge.

"He's a very good coach and he's very close to (USC coach) Pete Carroll," said
Weis of fellow rookie college head coach Robinson, whose team's admitted
defensive improvements haven't shown up in the 1-8 bottom line. "They go all the
way back to from high school to college (to the NFL). I remember years ago they
were on the same staff for the Jets, and their philosophies are very similar."

It's what Syracuse is doing offensively that was more mysterious to Weis -- and
apparently the Orange players as well.

Syracuse does lead the nation in red-zone offense, having scored 93 percent of
the time it has reached its opponents 20-yard line or beyond. The problem is,
the Orange don't get to the red zone that much (15 times), ranking 113th out of
117 Div. I-A teams in scoring. Only North Texas, Mississippi State, Buffalo and
Temple are scoring at a more anemic rate than Syracuse's 13.9 points per game.

Robinson, who has worked on staffs with Irish offensive coordinator Michael
Haywood and defensive coordinator Rick Minter, lamented that he walked into a
tougher situation than Weis to make an immediate offensive impact this year. He
said he had to convert an option offense to a "West Coast offense," to which
Weis replied, "I don't know what the West Coast offense is anymore, to tell you
the truth.

"The West Coast offense really is what the San Francisco 49ers ran in the late
'80s to early '90s," Weis continued. "Everything now is just an offspring of
that. Everyone has their own adaptation. ... It's not the true Bill Walsh
three-step drop step-drop-hitch and diagonals that they throw all the time.

"As far as it related to me and the people here, we had especially on offense,
so many guys returning that it was very easy to mold those guys into a system.
And I've always been one to find out what your guys can do and that's what you
do. So my philosophy is a little bit different. I can put in whatever I feel
necessary to give us the best chance, based on what I feel our guys are capable
of doing."

And what if Weis had inherited an option quarterback?

"He'd be playing another position," Weis said.

Prior commitment

Weis made a classy move Saturday, coaxing his team to honor Navy by having his
Irish players stand near the Midshipmen as the Navy alma mater was sung after
the game.

Of course, NBC might have a different take on it, seeing as though Weis blew off
sideline reporter Lewis Johnson to join his team in their warm gesture.

Ho-hum on awards

Weis and Irish quarterback Brady Quinn did little more than yawn over the
junior's inclusion as one of 10 players on the watch list for the Walter Camp
college football player of the year award.

It's still all about team.

"We'll worry about individual awards after the season is over," Weis said.
"Right now the team is just focused on worrying about beating Syracuse this
week."

Joining Quinn on the watch list are USC quarterback Matt Leinart, USC running
back Reggie Bush, Texas quarterback Vince Young, UCLA quarterback Drew Olson,
UCLA running back/return man Maurice Jones-Drew, Washington State running back
Jerome Harrison, Louisville defensive end Elvis Dumervil, Ohio State linebacker
A.J. Hawk and Penn State linebacker Paul Posluszny.

Squibs

* Fiesta Bowl president and CEO John Junker will send a representative to South
Bend for Saturday's ND-Syracuse matchup and is planning to take in the
Alabama-Auburn game himself.

He warned not to read too much into that, though. He's always wanted to go to an
Alabama-Auburn game, and this is a good reason to go. And he said he won't meet
with his selection committee until after the Nov. 26 games to try to form a
pecking order.

* So far committed safety Leonard Gordon (Fort Campbell, Ky.) is the only
confirmed official recruiting visitor for Saturday's Irish-Syracuse game. ND's
next recruiting window will be the Dec. 2 football banquet at which former Irish
head coach Lou Holtz will be the guest speaker.

* Weis left the door open Tuesday that suspended fifth-year running back Rashon
Powers-Neal could return to the team yet this season, but Powers-Neal was not at
practice Tuesday and hasn't been since his suspension was announced at the USC
game on Oct. 15.

* Freshman defensive lineman Pat Kuntz, who was injured in Saturday's 42-21
victory over Navy and left the field on crutches, was not a participant in
Tuesday's practice, either.

YES, BUT HOW?

BYLINE: MARTIN FENNELLY

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 600 words

DATELINE: JACKSONVILLE


We can call it a mirage. We can say it will come crashing down, maybe as soon as
next week in Fayetteville against Arkansas, or Nov. 19 in Baton Rouge against
Presbyterian's evil twin, LSU. Or for sure, if they get that far, if they get to
Atlanta, against Lord Saban in the SEC Championship Game.

Yes, there's no way Florida's Gators can get anywhere with this creaky offense.

Gators coach Jim McElwain listened to all the questions.

"Did we win?" McElwain said. "I just want to make sure."

They won. Florida beat Georgia 24-10, the Gators' third straight win over the
Bulldogs. Florida is deeply flawed, and Georgia isn't any good. There's that.
But there's this, too: UF is 6-1 overall, 4-1 and has a firm grip of first place
in the SEC East, where it controls its own destiny, and technically - with a
capital T - is in the playoff hunt. Insert a laugh track if you want. Or look
for smoke and mirrors.

The 14th-ranked Gators have a shot right up until they don't.

Those are the rules.

Florida won Saturday with defense and more defense, the only thing it has,
holding Georgia to 164 yards, including 21 on the ground. Good thing, because
quarterback Luke Del Rio and the Florida offense managed only 231 yards. It's
hard to believe Florida can make a second straight SEC title game with this
wretched offense.

Then again, Florida made it last year with one of the more horrific offenses in
recent memory. This Gators offense is a lot better statistically than last
year's - and this offense in terrible.

Last year the Gators were smashed in their final three games, by Florida State,
Alabama and Michigan, getting outscored 97-24.

Sometimes I think we forget that those Gators won 10 games in McElwain's first
season.

Del Rio's first pass of his Florida-Georgia career was an interception. There
was no way around that, or the fact that he was wild all day, or that UF
struggled mightily at running the ball. I'm not even sure Del Rio will be the
starter next season. Or that this offense won't cost the Gators when they run
into the SEC West in coming weeks.

They got a big assist when South Carolina beat Tennessee later in the day,
essentially giving the Gators a two-game lead over Kentucky in the East.

Does the head coach really believe his team can go places with the defense
carrying the offense?

"Sure," McElwain said. "I believe we can. I believe we have the ingredients,
both offensively and defensively and on special teams, to make a heck of a run."

At times, Florida's defense will make you believe anything is possible. Take
away that 35-point second half in Knoxville and we'd talk about these dudes in
reverent awe. This defense is winning games.

It entered play Saturday ranked second to only Michigan in total defense and
scoring defense, and it played like it once it contained Georgia quarterback
Jacob Eason.

Nick Chubb was held to 20 yards on nine carries. Helping lead the way for the
Gators were defensive linemen Caleb Brantley, Khairi Clark and Jabari Zuniga -
and middle linebacker Jarrad Davis, who led his team in tackles and tackles for
loss despite playing on a bad ankle.

"He's the heart and soul of this team," McElwain said of Davis.

There's a lot of heart and soul going around on that D. It's the only thing
standing between the Gators and disaster.

All I know is that Saturday, Florida beat Georgia, and McElwain is 2-0 against
the Bulldogs, and Georgia's Kirby Smart is 4-4 in his first season as head coach
in Athens.

You can only beat whom you play that day.

There is danger down the road. Trouble everywhere. Surely Florida will be
exposed.

Florida beat Georgia.

We double checked.

Dallas Cowboys star Deion Sanders was arrested Wednesday night on a trespassing
charge after being warned to leave a restricted lake on airport property in this
southwest Florida city. Sanders was fishing on the lake with a friend when he
was arrested.

A native of Fort Myers, Sanders said he is only home two or three days a year
and the temptation of the lake's large bass was just too great. Added Sanders,
"I wasn't out there 10 minutes and they caught me. But I had 10 fish by that
time."

He was arrested on the first-degree misdemeanor charge, which carries a maximum
penalty of one year in jail and a $ 1,000 fine. He was released on his own
recognizance. A court hearing is set for July 8.

Iowa offense not flashy, but test for UF;
Gators still battling injuries, especially at linebacker

BYLINE: Garry Smits

SECTION: Pg. C-3

LENGTH: 633 words


The University of Florida defense is facing an Iowa offense in Monday's Outback
Bowl in Tampa that is 77th in the nation in scoring, 120th in total offense and
114th in passing offense.

Easy pickings, right?

Except for one thing: the Hawkeyes may not be dynamic moving the football, but
they don't turn it over.

The 21st-ranked Hawks (8-4) are second in the nation behind Western Michigan in
committing the fewest turnovers, with only nine for the season. The strength of
the Iowa offense, running backs Leshun Daniels (1,013 yards) and Akrum Wadley
(966), have combined for only one fumble, that by Wadley in a victory over
Illinois.

That's solid progress for Wadley, who will give the Hawkeyes only the second
1,000-yard rushing tandem among Power 5 conferences with 34 yards against the
20th-ranked Gators (8-4). Two years ago, he had three fumbles in 33 carries, and
found himself deep on the Iowa bench.

Wadley helped cure himself with one of the oldest tricks in the book: he carried
a football with him wherever he went, including to class.

Iowa leads the nation in fewest fumbles with two (the other was by wide receiver
Riley McCarron) and quarterback C.J. Beathard is fourth in the Big Ten with the
fewest interceptions (seven).

The Florida defense ranks tied for 52nd in the nation in forcing turnovers with
21 (eight fumble recoveries, 13 interceptions), but the Gators do a good job
getting off the field, ranking fourth in the SEC in third-down conversion rate
(35 percent).

Still, a big turnover or two wouldn't hurt. Florida had two clutch fumble
recoveries in its 16-10 victory over LSU that clinched the SEC East title.

In a 54-16 loss to Alabama in the SEC championship game, Florida do not force a
turnover.

While Iowa coach Kirk Ferentz isn't about to change his team's stingy ways, he
said there's always the chance it might not matter against the Gators, who were
among the SEC's best defenses until giving up 71 offensive points in their last
two games.

"They've got an NFL back end [the secondary, led by cornerbacks Jalen Tabor and
Quincy Wilson] ... their linebackers are really good. They've had injuries and
the guys that have stepped in have done a nice job," he said. "They are a
well-coached group. They're sound. They don't give up easy plays or big plays,
so they're going to make you work. We're going to have to be opportunistic to
have a chance to win this thing."

Florida coach Jim McElwain said his defense needs to first stop Iowa's running
game, then worry about Beathard, a three-year starter who never dazzles anyone
but is 21-6 as a starter.

"You can't allow a team to just pound the ball on you," McElwain said. "You've
got to at least force them to use both run and pass. No secret, as any game we
go into. It's about stopping the run first."

UF is still battered at linebacker. Junior Alex Anzalone practiced last week
after being declared out for the season in November with a broken arm, but he is
still projected to be out, along with fellow lineback starter Jarrad Davis
(ankle) of St. Mary's, Ga.

One of the young players who stepped in when Anzalone and Davis went out was
freshman David Reese, but he's out because of a wrist injury. That leaves
freshmen Kylan Johnson and Vosean Joseph as starters. Senior Daniel McMillian of
Jacksonville will back them up but junior walk-on Cristian Garcia may have to
play.

Safety Nick Washington (ankle) of Jacksonville and defensive end Bryan Cox Jr.
(ankle) are both listed as questionable.

"It's going to really test the safeties to when we get down in the box, to be
able to stand up to that run game and get the guys to the ground," McElwain said
of Daniels and Wadley. "But that's our responsibility to put a plan together to
put them on the ground. Our guys are going to have to be really disciplined on
the back end."

EX-BADGER WON'T FACE CRIMINAL CHARGES;
P.J. HILL DUE IN COURT MONDAY FOR ALLEGED DRIVING OFFENSES.

BYLINE: By ED TRELEVEN etreleven@madison.com 608-252-6134

SECTION: LOCAL; Pg. A5

LENGTH: 220 words


Former Wisconsin Badgers running back P.J. Hill won't face criminal charges for
a March 14 incident in which he allegedly led police on a short chase while
driving drunk.

Hill, 22, the third-leading rusher in Badgers history, instead was ticketed
Tuesday for first-offense drunken driving, reckless driving, refusing to take a
Breathalyzer test and driving without headlights.

He is scheduled to appear in court on Monday.

The first-offense drunken driving charge could become a second-offense,
depending upon when another first-offense drunken driving charge, which Hill
faces in Arizona, is resolved. While a first offense in Wisconsin is punishable
by fines and a license revocation, a second offense carries a minimum five days
in jail along with fines and a license revocation.

Hill left UW-Madison and decided to forego his senior year of eligibility to
enter the National Football League draft. He was arrested by university police
on tentative felony charges after he allegedly crashed into a guard rail at the
Open Pantry store on Regent Street, then led police on a chase back to his
apartment. The chase ended when he crashed his car into a retaining wall.

In addition to the tickets in Madison, Hill still faces charges in Scottsdale,
that include drunken driving and unreasonable speed in an early March incident.

Oilers' run-and-shoot faces more scrutiny

BYLINE: Bryan Burwell

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 3C

LENGTH: 539 words

DATELINE: HOUSTON


In the aftermath of another season ending too soon, the Houston Oilers are still
one big happy family.

Jack Pardee is coming back.

Buddy Ryan and Kevin Gilbride want to come back.

About the only thing that might not come back is the
high-powered-but-inconsistent Oilers' run-and-shoot offense.

"I've never been married to any offense," Oilers coach Pardee said Monday, the
day after being ousted from the playoffs with a 28-20 loss to Kansas City. "In
Chicago, they said my offense was just handing the ball off to Walter Payton.
But (evaluating the run-and-shoot) is something I'll look at. "

The Oilers' offense, the NFL's third-best overall, has been heavily criticized
in Houston - particularly by defensive coordinator Ryan. But offensive
coordinator Gilbride doesn't want to alter anything.

"I can't imagine one game giving justification or reason for transition or
change to some other offense," said Gilbride. "This
offense has been the best in the NFL the last four years."    As

far as the status of his two coordinators, who fought publicly and privately all
season, Pardee said he wants them both back for next season. "

COWPOKE BUDDY: Dallas Cowboys coach Jimmy Johnson said Monday he would consider
hiring Buddy Ryan if the controversial defensive coordinator of Houston was
fired. "I would consider it in all seriousness," Johnson said. "Oh, maybe my ego
couldn't handle Buddy having competing press conferences."

THOUGHT PROCESS: San Francisco 49ers coach George Seifert was so troubled by the
way his team was performing, that earlier this month, he said he couldn't think
about sex. Another motivational ploy? "Actually, you'll have to talk to George
about that," linebacker Mike Walter said with a laugh. "I don't know what kind
of film he watches." No wonder Seifert drew a hearty round of giggles at a news
conference this week when asked what he did Saturday night. "I came back to the
office and broke down some film," he said. "My wife and son came over to play
racquetball and that was our evening."

BRIEFLY: Cincinnati Bengals coach Dave Shula said he is interested in bringing
fired New York Jets coach Bruce Coslet back to Cincinnati as the Bengals'
offensive coordinator. Coslet, 47, coached nine seasons for the Bengals and was
their offensive coordinator under ex-coach Sam Wyche before going to the Jets in
1990. . . . British bookmakers have made the Dallas Cowboys 6-5 favorites to
repeat as Super Bowl champs. San Francisco is 7-4, Buffalo 5-1 and Kansas City
13-2. . . . Buffalo tight end Pete Metzelaars, who dislocated a finger Saturday,
practiced Monday and expects to play against the Chiefs.

Elkhart man re-indicted by grand jury

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 538 words


Oct. 4--A 21-year-old Elkhart man whose father has already been sentenced to
prison in relation to the same alleged victims has been re-indicted on charges
of sexual misconduct by an Anderson County grand jury.

Michael Shane Vick, 21, of Elkhart was indicted last month on two counts of
indecency with a child  -- sexual contact and a single count of indecency with a
child by exposure, according to records released by the Anderson County district
clerk's office.

Vick, a former soldier in the U.S. Army, was arrested at Dallas-Fort Worth
International Airport in July 2007 upon returning from overseas military
service, stemming from allegations he committed inappropriate acts with two
girls under the age of 10.

His father, James Edward Vick, 46, of Elkhart, was sentenced to 20 years in the
Texas Department of Criminal Justice after pleading guilty this past July to 18
counts of indecency with a child in Anderson County.

James Vick and his wife were contract foster parents for the Bair Foundation, a
non-profit Christian foster care agency, for roughly 15 years and fostered
dozens of children during that period, authorities have said.

Other indictments handed down by the grand jury on Sept. 16 included:

Attempted Prohibited Item in Correctional Facility

--LaQuincy Miller, 33, Corsicana, date of alleged offense, July 12, 2009.

--Natalie Ramirez, 41, Houston, date of alleged offense, Aug. 1, 2009.

Oakland defense simply can't offset poor offense

BYLINE: Column by Monte Poole

SECTION: SAN MATEO; Monte Poole; Sports

LENGTH: 815 words


BALTIMORE -- With a pinch between his cheek and gum and another fruitless
afternoon stuck in his gut, Warren Sapp sat before his cubicle trying to beat
back the ghosts in his midst.

The Raiders defensive tackle is being haunted by the familiar. He is seeing in
Oakland what he saw years ago, when he was in Tampa Bay, where he was the
catalyst of a defense marvelous enough to bail out a consistently pathetic
offense.

This, Sapp concluded, in the wake of Sunday's 28-6 loss to Baltimore at M&T Bank
Stadium, Oakland's second straight game without a touchdown, is not quite the
same.

Seeing these Raiders open the season with consecutive games without scoring a
touchdown, Sapp said, is worse.

"We didn't have weapons," he recalled of his first six years with the
Buccaneers. "We had a fullback (Mike Alstott) catching the ball in the flat and
a little bit of Warrick Dunn squirting around."

Sapp noted the superiority of the Tampa defense but is having trouble accepting
the lackluster Oakland offense.

"You can see the talent," he said. "(In Tampa) we had no talent. We just used to
say wehave to win 3-0. Or we have to win 2-0, get the safety."

Those Bucs had a championship defense for years before the offense caught up.
The result was a 2002 championship.

Though these Raiders are playing admirable defense, they are not at championship
level. The Oakland offense, however, figured to provide the Raiders with the
kind of balance lacking at Tampa.

But no. It didn't happen last season, when the Raiders -- despite adding wideout
Randy Moss and running back LaMont Jordan -- averaged barely two touchdowns per
game. Al Davis replaced head coach Norv Turner with Art Shell, replaced
offensive coordinator Jimmy Raye with Tom Walsh and replaced quarterback Kerry
Collins with Aaron Brooks.

The early results reveal profound regression. The Raiders barely topped 100
yards in total offense last Monday night and managed only 162 against the Ravens
and the equally stifling Maryland humidity.

This is Art Shell's worst nightmare. The man is lured from the comfort of a job
in the league office, summoned to revive the franchise he loves, and his first
two weeks are arguably the most atrocious in Raiders history.

There is the ongoing cold war between Davis/Shell and wideout Jerry Porter,
certainly counterproductive. Then there is Moss and a few others clearly
displeased with certain issues within the team. There is the inability to
establish any semblance of offense, resulting in 15 sacks and zero touchdowns
through two games.

"I'm very frustrated," Shell said, "but not to the point where I've given up on
this team or the direction we're headed."

The last time the Raiders opened the season by going eight quarters without a
touchdown was in 1961. They were terrible, losing 55-0 at Houston and 44-0 at
San Diego. They finished 2-12. Thirteen months later, Al took charge and the
Raiders become the Rayduhs, symbols of swashbuckling toughness.

Through the first two weeks, the defense has shown enough to be competitive, to
keep the opposing offense from owning the field. But the Oakland offense has
been downright unsightly.

"I take my hat off to the defense," Jordan said. "Those guys played well against
a good offense. And we kept them on the field too much."

Whether Baltimore has a good offense is debatable. There's no arguing whether
the Oakland's impotent offense made things difficult for its defense.

The first Ravens drive, following a 72-yard return of the opening kickoff, began
at Oakland's 32. The next, after the recovery of a fumbled snap, began in
Oakland's 35. The next, after another fumbled snap, began at Oakland's 29. Each
time, the Raiders defense kept the damage to a field goal.

"When a team is kicking field goals," Sapp said, "you're definitely giving
yourself a shot to win."

Can't win when the quarterback is on his back, whether it's Brooks or backup
Andrew Walter. Walsh has not distinguished himself as a play-caller creative
enough to conceal a hideous offensive line, and the line has shown no sign of
being anything other than hideous.

"Anytime your quarterback drops back in a four-man rush and he's constantly
under pressure, that's a problem," Jordan said. "That's a big problem. It's one
of those problems that, if we don't hurry up and get it fixed, it's going to be
a long season."

Too late. It's a long season when you're staring at a problem with no quick or
apparent solution. It's a long season when one side of the ball is trying to
bail out the other side.

Sapp acknowledges it worked, to some degree, in Tampa. But this is different.
The offensive line is hazardous to a quarterback's health, and the defense is
very much a work in progress.

"Just gotta keep plugging," Sapp said, spitting into the towel on the floor.
"They'll catch up with us."

Perhaps. But what year?

Athlon Sports' names Orlosky preseason All-American

BYLINE: Williamson Daily News, W.Va.

SECTION: SPORTS

LENGTH: 236 words


June 23--MORGANTOWN, W.Va. -- West Virginia University senior center Tyler
Orlosky was named to Athlon Sports' preseason All-American Third team as
announced by the organization today.

Orlosky, a preseason All-Big 12 First Team center from Cleveland, Ohio, from the
same publication, started all 13 games last season and saw action on more than
1,000 plays. He helped pave the way for the offense to average 479.7 yards per
game of total offense, 34.0 points, 228.2 rushing yards and 251.5 passing yards.
The offense ranked No. 17 nationally in rushing offense, No. 18 in first down
offense and No. 23 in total offense.

A 2016 Rimington Trophy Award "Watch List" nominee, Orlosky graded out 90
percent or better in all 13 games last season. The WVU rushing attack produced
200 or more yards in six games, 300 or more yards in three games and a
season-high 426 yards at Kansas. In the last six games of 2015, the rushing
offense averaged 251 yards per game and 499.3 yards of total offense.

In the Big 12, Orlosky is one of only two returning all-conference offensive
linemen from 2015 and is the only returning Big 12 lineman listed on the final
ranking of the Schneider Scale (ranked the best 25 lineman in the nation used
for the Outland Trophy).

Lay preacher charged with sex offences

BYLINE: Neil Macfarlane

SECTION: NEWS: CRIME

LENGTH: 317 words


A PREACHER at the centre of a child abuse investigation has been charged with a
series of sex offences.

Keith Morton worked as a Methodist church lay preacher in Darlington after
moving to the region from the Midlands.

The American-born 43-year-old lived in Carmel Road, in the town, and worked at
Elm Ridge Methodist Church.

Mr Morton has been charged with nine sex offences against underage boys. He is
currently on remand in jail in Staffordshire following his arrest in July last
year.

Detective Constable Steven Chatterton, of Darlington Police's child abuse
investigation team, said some of the alleged offences took place in Darlington,
while others allegedly took place elsewhere.

"All the charges involve sex offences against children,"

he said.

"If he pleads not guilty to any of the offences, he will be likely to stand
trial at Teesside Crown Court."

When Mr Morton was arrested last year, leaders at the church in Darlington
issued the following statement.

"Keith has served as a pastoral assistant at Elm Ridge Methodist Church since
September 2006, but was immediately suspended from this post in connection with
the investigation into these allegations.

"The church takes the safety and well-being of children and young people very
seriously and has stringent safeguarding procedures.

"We are offering support to all those affected by this case and ask that people
respect their privacy during this difficult time."

Mr Morton has since been fired by the church.

Mr Morton was born in New Haven, Connecticut, in the US, and served in the US
army before studying at university.

He earned degrees in theology from the University of Florida and Drew University
in New Jersey, before heading overseas to work with the Methodist church.

He moved to the UK in 2000, and spent a year in Tachov, in the Czech Republic,
before moving to Darlington in September 2006.

Mr Morton is on remand in jail at HMP Birmingham.

PRO BASKETBALL: Notebook;
3-Guard Offense Fits Trail Blazers

BYLINE: By SAM GOLDAPER

SECTION: Section B; Page 16; Column 1; Sports Desk

LENGTH: 806 words


The 9-0 Portland Trail Blazers are averaging 125.5 points a game. Almost half of
them have come from the three-guard offense of Clyde Drexler (26.7), Terry
Porter (18.1) and Danny Ainge (15.1).

Three-guard offense? Isn't that what cost Portland the National Basketball
Association championship last June when Isiah Thomas, Joe Dumars and Vinnie
Johnson, the Dettoit Pistons' famed three-guard offense, outscored the Portland
backcourt, 304-252.

Bucky Buckwalter, who heads the Trail Blazers' basketball operations, came away
from the loss with a lesson. Forty-one days later he gave up Byron Irvin,
Portland's first-round draft choice in 1991, and a second-round pick in 1992 to
get Ainge, a premier shooter, away from the Sacramento Kings. Thus was born the
Trail Blazers' three-guard offense.

"I've always liked the three-guard offense," Buckwalter said yesterday, "because
it allows you to play three backcourt men big minutes. But it's not always easy
to put together. The third guard has to be able to play both the point and
shooting guards and be able to fit in with both starters. It has to be a special
person and Danny Ainge is that kind of person."

Several other teams, the Chicago Bulls and the Dallas Mavericks, among them,
have opted for three-guard offenses through off-season trades, but none has
matched the devastating statistics piled up by the Portland trio.

Michael Jordan and the Bulls learned that Sunday night when Drexler, Ainge and
Porter, shooting 21 of 33 from the field, combined for 60 points in a 125-112
victory that kept the Trail Blazers as the National Basketball Association's
lone unbeaten team.

"Portland is by far the best team we have faced so far," said Jordan, outscored,
30-29, in his matchup with Drexler. "They remind me very much of the Pistons.
They've got that same three-guard rotation. They were a good basketball team but
the addition of Ainge makes them so much better. He adds that leadership they
lacked from the bench. He's a very smart player. He's going to educate them in a
lot of pressure situations."

Portland, which has only been behind once, 2-0 to the Denver Nuggets, in the
last five games has shot better than 60 percent from the field in each of their
last four games.

The record for the most victories at the start of the season is 12 by the 1948
Washington Capitols, coached by Red Auerbach.

Centers of Attraction

 Patrick Ewing leads the league in blocked shots (4.78), is tied for third in
rebounding (12.3) and is seventh in scoring (26.8). Akeem Olajuwon is the
rebounding pacesetter (13.1), tied for 15th in scoring (24.5.) and second in
blocked shots (3.75). When the Knicks host the Houston Rockets tonight at
Madison Square Garden another chapter will be added in their meeting,
unquestionably the pre-eminent matchup of centers in the game today.

The rivalry was born in 1984 at the Final Four in Seattle when Georgetown and
Houston met for the National Collegiate Athletic Association chamnpionship.
Georgetown won the game, 84-75, but Olajuwon outscored Ewing, 15-10. In their
previous eight N.B.A. meetings, which the Knicks and Rockets have split,
Olajuwon has gone against Ewing low, matching strength with strength. Ewing has
run the floor and Olajuwon has tagged along. Statisically, Ewing has outscored
Olajuwon, 25.1 to 24.5, while Olajuwon has won the battle of the boards, 14.6 to
7.9.

Grunfeld Promotion

 Ernie Grunfeld, a former Knick player and currently an assistant coach, has
been named the team's director of administration, replacing Hal Childs, who in
turn has been given the newly created position of director of special projects.
Childs, who has twice undergone heart surgery, has been advised by his doctor to
ease his day-to-day activities.

The 35-year-old Grunfeld, among other duties, will assist Al Bianchi, the
Knicks' general manager, as well as act as the liaison between the Knicks and
the league. Grunfeld will not be replaced on the coaching staff.

N.B.A. Levels Fines

 Rod Thorn, the N.B.A.'s vice president of operations, has fined James
Donaldson, the Dallas Maverick center, $3,000, and Byron Scott, the Los Angeles
Lakers' guard, $1,000, for their altercation during Friday night's game, which
the Mavericks won, 99-86. . . . Bernard King, the Washington Bullets'
high-scoring forward, is the league's leader with a 30.3 scoring average,
three-tenths of a point ahead of David Robinson of the San Antonio Spurs. . . .
The Los Angeles Clippers might have been a little embarrassed by scoring only 78
points, but it was more than enough to beat the Seattle SuperSonics, 78-65,
Sunday night. The score offered the fewest points scored by the Sonics and the
fewest allowed by the Clippers. Seattle's previous club mark for the fewest was
73, on Oct. 31, 1985, against Denver.

Jan. 22--ORLANDO -- Prestonsburg High School sophomore Shaler Spencer competed
in Offense-Defense All-American Bowl earlier in the month. The 9th annual
Offense-Defense Bowl Week festivities took place at the Citrus Bowl Week in
Orlando.

Spencer (6-1, 205) started at both offensive tackle and defensive end for his
squad in the event's High School Showcase. Defensively, Spencer recorded four
tackles and provided consistent pressure on the opposing team's quarterback. On
the offensive side, Spencer helped to gain yardage for his team, which pulled
out a last-minute 22-20 victory.

A week-long series of Offense-Defense Bowl events included the televised 9th
Annual Offense-Defense All-American Bowl, an All-Star football game that
showcased 88 of the top high school seniors in the country and has featured
current NFL players including Cam Newton, Joe Haden and Dez Bryant among others,
before they were collegiate and later professional stars.

Offense-Defense Sports has been running full-contact football instructional
camps for the past 45 years and currently operates in approximately 40 camp
locations nationwide every spring and summer.

Spencer's team included additional players from Kentucky, Washington, Tennessee,
Maryland, Georgia, North Carolina, Connecticut, New Jersey, Delaware,
Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Oklahoma, Nevada, Virginia, Missouri, New York and
Mexico.

"I'm thankful for this honor," Spencer said, following his team's win. "I love
the effort we gave to win this game."

Spencer is already looking forward to competing in the Offense-Defense camp in
Tampa, Fla., as well as other camps, during the upcoming summer.

Steelers still the class of NFL

BYLINE: Jeffrey Goodman; GAM

LENGTH: 835 words

DATELINE: Toronto ON


Understandably, Pittsburgh Steelers, the National Football League
 defending champions, are overwhelming favorites to become the first team
 to win four Super Bowls.

The Steelers, who won 14 games and lost two last season, are blessed
 with an abundance of talent and experience, and have one of the most
 solid coaching staffs in the business. The NFL, which begins the first of
 16 weeks of regular-season play tonight, provides them with a stern test
 Monday night, however, when the Steelers' opposition will be New England
 Patriots, under new head coach Ron Erhardt. It could be a preview of the
 AFC championship.

Dallas Cowboys, who lost to the Steelers in last year's final, are
 expected by many to be Pittsburgh's opposition in Pasadena at the end of
 January, but injury and retirement problems could be big factors in the
 playoffs. Los Angeles Rams are capable of beating them.

This is how the first weekend of play looks: (The grid line's
 prediction for each game, strictly on who should win and not based on the
 point spread, precedes the oddsmakers' line, which is in parentheses.)
    Detroit at Tampa Bay: The Bucs offence should be better this season
 with quarterback Doug Williams and running back Rickey Bell healthy
 again. Their defence is one of the toughest in the league. The Lions
 could be in trouble because of Gary Danielson's knee injury and the game
 is in Buccaneer land. Tampa Bay. (Tampa Bay by 4).

Atlanta at New Orleans: The Falcons defensive squad had a poor
 exhibition season and Saints quarterback Archie Manning is capable of
 making it look terrible. The Saints are due for a big season. This looks
 like the one. New Orleans (New Orleans by 5).

Baltimore at Kansas City: Marv Levy has built a tough defence and
 powerful running attack, but will need a better aerial attack if the
 Chiefs are to improve this season. Whether the Colts succeed this year
 will depend on one thing - the health of quarterback Bert Jones. He is
 healthy now, so . . . Baltimore (Kansas City by 2).

Cincinnati at Denver: After a dismal start, the Bengals finished last
 season rather strongly. They still aren't playoff material, however, and
 the Broncos, despite the loss of Lyle Alzado, are. Norris Weese should
 make the Broncos offence more interesting this season. Denver (Denver by
 4).

Cleveland at New York Jets: The Jets could very well be the surprise
 team in the league this season. Their defence has improved considerably
 and they already have the offence. Cleveland has the offence but injury
 problems on defence. New York. (New York by 3).

Dallas at St. Louis: The Cowboys lose very few opening-day games. They
 do have injuries, but not enough to comfort the Cardinals. Dallas could
 spend the afternoon piling up points. Dallas (Dallas by 5).

Green Bay at Chicago: The Bears' quarterbacking situation is still
 confusing. They have Walter Payton, of course, but their offence isn't as
 powerful as the Packers'. Green Bay had a good start last season. It
 could very well happen again. Green Bay (Chicago by 4).

Houston at Washington: Joe Theismann finally gets his chance, but it's
 a bad time to take over. The Redskins are rebuilding. The Oilers are
 polishing what they already have built. The Redskins will have a tough
 time handling Earl Campbell, Dan Pastorini and company. Houston (Houston
 by 4).

Miami at Buffalo: Bob Griese should have an easy time making the Bills
 defence look inept. Buffalo blew it by allowing Tom Cousineau to get
 away. The Bills also have the weakest defensive line in the league. This
 will be another long season for Buffalo. Miami (Miami by 5).

New York Giants at Philadelphia: The Giants enter the season with a
 lot of question marks. The offence hasn't been scoring and the defensive
 secondary is suspect. The Eagles are looking for another playoff berth.
 The Giants are hallucinating if they are. Philadelphia (Philadelphia by
 7).

Oakland at Los Angeles: Are Al Davis and Ken Stabler friends again?
 Will Stabler get back in shape. While the Raiders wait and see, the Rams,
 who are solid, will begin on a positive note. They are the better team.
 Los Angeles (Los Angeles by 4).

San Diego at Seattle: This should be high-scoring, entertaining game -
 it features two of the most exciting offences in the league. The Chargers
 probably have the better defence, but the Seahawks are opening at home,
 which should mean something. Seattle. (Seattle by 1).

San Francisco at Minnesota: Tom Kramer has a tough act to follow as
 the Vikings quarterback and the Vikings aren't up there with the big
 teams. They open against the worst team in the league, however, so should
 not encounter any difficulties. Minnesota (Minnesota by 7).

Pittsburgh at New England: Grogan's knee is suspect and Chuck Noll
 will be determined that his team not suffer from early-season
 complacency. The Patriots are solid otherwise, but the Steelers are the
 team to beat. They will continue to be so for this season at least, even
 if Terry Bradshaw can't match his superb play of last season. Pittsburgh.

CLEAR SKIES Should be plenty of opportunity for Air Raid against Oregon

BYLINE: Jacob Thorpe jacobt@spokesman.com, (509) 710-8070

SECTION: B; Pg. 007

LENGTH: 502 words

DATELINE: PULLMAN


COUGARS AT DUCKS

Even without Heisman winning quarterback Marcus Mariota, the Oregon offense has
had in-and-out end zone privileges, putting up 60 points in two of its first
three games.

An injury to this year's starter, Vernon Adams, formerly of Eastern Washington,
hasn't exactly grounded the Ducks, who put up 41 points at Colorado last week.

So while not facing either of those two passers opens a door of opportunity for
the Cougars to walk through it they're going to need more than just a good day
from their defense. The offense is going to have to start putting up points in
bunches.

A 37-point outburst at Rutgers in Week 2 was the only time the Air Raid offense
appeared to be working anywhere near its capability during Washington State's
(2-2, 0-1 Pac-12) first four games.

A seven-sack showing by quarterback Luke Falk and the offensive line stifled the
WSU offense last week at California, and against Portland State and Wyoming it
was stilted and inconsistent.

The matchup to watch on Saturday will be between WSU's potentially explosive
offense and the currently maligned Oregon defense.

The skies should be open for the Air Raid. The Ducks return just one starter
from last year's secondary, cornerback Chris Seisay, and he's out for the game
with a foot injury.

Currently ranked 105th in the country in pass efficiency defense, Oregon's
defense provides Falk an opportunity for a confidence- building, stats-gorging
game.

While Falk has completed passes at a high percentage, the offense is not
efficient through the air. The WSU passing offense ranks No. 7 nationally with
369.3 yards per game, but its average of 7.2 yards per attempt is the lowest
among the top 25 passing offenses.

Priority No. 1 for the WSU offense, and offensive line in particular, will be
tracking Oregon defensive lineman DeForest Buckner, who is expected to be
selected in the first round of the next NFL draft.

"Very active, strong, he plays a lot of positions," WSU coach Mike Leach said of
Buckner. "They move him around, they realize he's troublesome, also, so they
have him play a lot of stuff. Kind of like people used to do with Howie Long.
They'd just plug him in all over the place and try to expose them to him."

If the WSU offensive line is able to keep Falk free of Buckner and the
quarterback and receivers can exploit Oregon's pass defense, WSU will have a
shot to upset the Ducks and win in Eugene for the first time since 2003.

The last time WSU beat Oregon in any setting was 2007, although in recent years
the Cougars have made a game of it. In 2012 and 2013, the Cougars kept with the
Ducks for a half, and last year's 38-31 loss in Pullman was decided by a
controversial play where there was no call for pass interference.

"Year-in and year-out they are the top competitors," linebacker Jeremiah Allison
said. "You prepare for them just as you prepare for any other team. But growing
up, you had a chance to see them in the limelight."

Deficiencies Highlighted In USF Loss

QUARTERBACKS ARE ONLY PART OF THE PROBLEM

By BRETT McMURPHY

bmcmurphy@tampatrib.com

COLUMBIA, S.C. -- As South Florida's players trudged off the field after
Saturday's 34-3 loss at South Carolina, nearly each one said they didn't know
what had happened.

This much the Bulls do know -- they must improve their offense, shore up their
defense and special teams or they could be in for a long season.

"We went up against a good football team and we didn't play particularly well
and they did," USF coach Jim Leavitt said Sunday. "That was the bottom line."

After two games, the Bulls (1-1) remain unsettled at quarterback. Sophomore Pat
Julmiste and senior Ronnie Banks have each started a game, but neither has
clearly asserted himself.

"Our quarterbacks weren't very good at all [Saturday]," quarterbacks coach Rod
Smith said. "We're not playing smart and we're not accurate."

Against Carolina, USF managed only 191 yards -- or 19 fewer than Troy Williamson
had receiving for the Gamecocks. Even Vanderbilt gained 306 yards against
Carolina two weeks ago.

The Bulls' defense allowed South Carolina 530 yards, the third-most ever by USF,
and the Bulls' offense had only eight first downs, the second-fewest in school
history.

USF has the nation's third-worst offense and fourth-worst passing offense. Among
Conference USA clubs, USF ranks last in passing offense, total offense and
scoring offense and second-to-last in rushing offense.

The decision on who starts Saturday at TCU likely won't be made until later in
the week, but Banks (21 of 39, two interceptions, 174 yards) and Julmiste (six
of 16, 30 yards) should both see action.

"We also got beat pretty good by Arkansas [42-3 in 2002 and finished 9-2],"
Leavitt said. "We had a rough game. We've got to move on."

ODDS AND ENDS: USF has been outgained in seven of its last 10 games against
Division I-A clubs. ... After three fumbles in the first two games, Bruce Gipson
will be replaced as the kickoff and punt returner. Andre Hall likely will take
over kickoff return duties with Travis Lipp returning punts. ... USF allowed
South Carolina a school-record worst 22.3 yards per completion.

Hed

: Cowboys players excited about new leader

By Scott Nulph

snulph@wyosports.net

LARAMIE - University of Wyoming sophomore running back Shaun Wick couldn't
contain himself when it was announced that North Dakota State coach Craig

Bohl

would take over as coach of the Cowboys.

Wick sent out a simple, but powerful tweet late Saturday night: "Back to the
good ole power offense. #

GoWyo #

PrayersAnswered

"

With

Bohl, the Cowboys will likely move to a West Coast offense that features a
running back and a fullback. It's the offense

Bohl

has used at NDSU, and one he's won 101 games and two straight Football
Championship Subdivision titles with in Fargo.

Wick, who ran for 979 yards and nine touchdowns in UW's spread offense this past
season, was one of a host of UW players on hand for Sunday's press conference to
announce the hiring of

Bohl

.

A day after his exuberant tweet, Wick's excitement was still evident.

"I've

been wanting to get a coach who runs the offense like that," the UW running back
said. "That's more of our style, and we're going to em

brace

it, because I definitely did in high school."

Wick wasn't the only offensive player happy with a possible change to the
offense.

"I looked up some highlights from some of their games to see what they kind of
run," sophomore offensive lineman Jake Jones said. "He's a great coach, and I'm
extremely excited to play for him. His record speaks for itself. As an offensive
lineman, you just want to put your hand in the ground and get after it.

"I'm really excited for whatever offense we run and try something new."

The Wyoming football team celebrated the 2013 season at its annual postseason
banquet just prior to Sunday's press conference. It was reported that former

coach

Dave Christensen was not in attendance at the banquet.

Then the Pokes began the process of looking ahead to 2014.

And it wasn't just the offensive players who are excited about

Bohl

and the new systems he'll bring to Wyoming.

Bohl

, a former defensive back during his playing days at Nebraska and linebackers
coach for the Cornhuskers, in addition to being the team's defensive coordinator
for three seasons, has built a rugged defense at NDSU as well.

"I was very excited that he was a defensive back," UW freshman cornerback

Tyran

Finley said. "I was overwhelmed with the excitement of how we're going to get
coached."

Finley also said the team has spent the last week dealing with the emotions of
Christensen's firing.

"It has been an emotional time for the team and

myself

," he said. "We had a real connection with the coaching staff we had. We know
that this is a business and everything happens for a reason. We're excited about
the new coaching staff coming and getting going with them."

UW junior cornerback Blair Burns echoed Finley's words.

"Right now we're just very excited," Burns said. "We're going to be under a new
program and definitely a new head coach. I think the guys are waiting to get on
the field and get a feel for what he's all about. We'll get a great feel when we
come back in January. I think the guys can't wait for that."

Sapp likes Shula at helm of offense

BYLINE: From wire reports

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 11

LENGTH: 317 words

DATELINE: CHARLOTTE, N.C.


- Former Buccaneers defensive tackle and current NFL Network analyst Warren Sapp
bumped into Carolina coach Ron Rivera this week and admitted he doesn't know
much about Rivera's Panthers team.

But Sapp knows plenty about Panthers offensive coordinator Mike Shula, who ran
the Bucs' offense when Sapp played in Tampa Bay.

Heard of the Mike & Mike Show on ESPN Radio? Well, Sapp said Tampa Bay's players
referred to the Bucs' attack under Shula as the Mike & Mike offense because of
Shula's reliance on fullback Mike Alstott.

That's all we had. Mike calling it, faking it to Mike, throwing it to Mike, Sapp
said. Mike Shula to Mike Alstott, that's what we called it - the Mike and Mike
offense.

The Bucs never finished higher than 22nd in total offense during Shula's four
years as coordinator. But Sapp, in Charlotte for Bobcats president Fred
Whitfield's annual golf tournament, believes Shula will be successful with more
offensive weapons with Carolina.

He's been dreaming up some stuff, I promise you. Mike will get it going, Sapp
said. He's going to find a way to get this offense moving. That's just what he
does. He's a good offensive coordinator. I like Mike.

BENGALS: Cincinnati signed defensive end Carlos Dunlap to a five-year contract
extension worth $40 million.

PACKERS: Green Bay signed safety Morgan Burnett to an extension reported by
NFL.com  to be worth $24.75 million over four years.PATRIOTS: Nebraska
prosecutors are moving to have probation revoked for defensive back Alfonzo
Dennard.

Online court records say an arraignment on the revocation motion is scheduled
for July 31.

The 23-year-old is charged with first-offense drunken driving, refusing a
chemical test and a traffic infraction.

It was Dennard's second arrest in 15 months.

The former Cornhuskers star hasn't served a 30-day jail sentence for assaulting
a police officer and resisting arrest outside a Lincoln bar on April 21, 2012.

Kragthorpe: Utah State will need offense vs. Fresno State

BYLINE: By Kurt Kragthorpe Tribune Columnist

SECTION: SPORTS; College Sports; USU Aggies

LENGTH: 458 words


This is not necessarily how Utah State's 2013 football team was designed, but
the way the Aggies have evolved this season creates an intriguing matchup in
Saturday's Mountain West championship game.

USU features a great defense and a barely adequate offense; FSU has a great
offense and a questionable defense.

The Aggies' offense in its current state is not capable of keeping up with
Fresno State, if the Bulldogs move the ball and score points at a level anywhere
close to their usual production. USU produced a total of only 501 yards in
victories over Colorado State and Wyoming in the last two games, but the Aggie
defense was phenomenal, allowing a total of seven points.

Fresno State is an entirely different issue. The Bulldogs' offense,
quarterbacked by Derek Carr and coordinated by former Utah assistant coach Dave
Schramm, is highly effective. But as shown in a 62-52 loss to San Jose State
last week, the FSU defense is vulnerable. It's up to what's left of the USU
offense -- namely freshman quarterback Darrel Garretson and running back Joey
DeMartino -- to take advantage of that opportunity and give the Aggies a chance
to win.

The Aggies will have to be more aggressive than they were against CSU and
Wyoming. I'd never seen a three-and-out sequence with three completed passes, as
happened on USU's opening possession last week, when Garretson kept throwing
short routes.

This is the one time that USU really could have used QB Chuckie Keeton. While
not devaluing Keeton's ability in any sense, I've observed the weird phenomenon
of this season: USU certainly would have beaten Air Force, Weber State and San
Jose State even without Keeton in September, and the Aggies actually have beaten
New Mexico, Hawaii, UNLV, CSU and Wyoming since his knee injury.

But now I'm saying the Aggies would beat Fresno State if they had Keeton -- and
they'll have an awfully tough time doing so without him.

If Matt Wells and his staff can pull off this upset, they will have produced the
best one-season coaching job in USU history. I've pointed out that USU caught a
scheduling break by missing Fresno State and San Diego State in the MW's
rotation, but the Aggies did go 7-1 in conference play. They've done it mostly
without Keeton and three other offensive starters, and receiver Travis Reynolds
recently joined that list with a season-ending injury.

Think about this: Utah lost to New Mexico, Colorado State, Wyoming, Air Force
and UNLV at least once in coach Kyle Whittingham's first three seasons. So those
wins for USU shouldn't be easily dismissed.

Fresno State is in another category. Beating the Bulldogs on the road is asking
a lot. But the Aggies deserve credit for giving themselves this opportunity.

Bowling Green poised to cut loose potent offense: Clawson says Ruggiero melds
Falcons' past with new system

BYLINE: Donald Emmons, The Blade, Toledo, Ohio

SECTION: SPORTS

LENGTH: 759 words


Dec. 28--BOISE -- It was not surprising to see Bowling Green's offense finish
the regular season ranked among the nation's powerhouses in Dave Clawson's first
season as head coach.

One of the first decisions Clawson made was to lure Warren Ruggiero to be his
offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach. He's arguably one of the brightest
offensive minds coaching in the college ranks.

He's done what the Falcons' coach had hoped for.

Quarterback Tyler Sheehan accounted for 302.58 yards a game, which ranked
seventh-best among QBs in the Football Bowl Subdivision's total offense
category. He ranked higher than notable signal-callers such as Notre Dame's
Jimmy Clausen (302.25 yards per game), Texas' Colt McCoy (296.92 YPG), and
Central Michigan's Dan LeFevour (288.0 YPG).

BGSU's offense, which will be on display in the Humanitarian Bowl against Idaho
on Wednesday, averaged 310.3 passing yards per game, which ranked eighth-best in
the country.

"I think Warren has done a great job of blending the things that I wanted.

"He's installed a system that is very friendly with what I've done so I can go
into a meeting and know exactly what we're doing.

"He studied what they did here last year and how they called things to make the
transition easy for Tyler, and he still stayed true to what he believes in.

"I think he's done a great job of really incorporating a lot of different ideas
and make it become a fluid offense."

Ruggiero's coaching dossier reveals plenty of past success as an offensive whiz
kid.

He was the Kansas State quarterbacks coach a year ago when Josh Freeman put up
huge numbers that eventually led to him leaving college early and being drafted
by Tampa Bay in the first round this year.

While serving as offensive coordinator at Hofstra from 2002-05, he coached
Marques Colston, who went on to become one of the NFL's top wide receivers with
the New Orleans Saints.

Furthermore, Ruggiero's offense ranked nationally in the top 10 statistically at
the end of 10 seasons in 16 previous seasons as an offensive coordinator.

How soon he would have the Falcons offense flying among college football's most
productive offenses was one of the many uncertainties for BGSU entering the 2009
campaign.

It required tinkering with an offense led by Sheehan, a three-year under former
BG coach Gregg Brandon.

Sheehan had thrown for better than 2,600 yards and at least 20 touchdowns in
each of the previous two seasons.

Although Ruggiero didn't come in and make wholesale changes to BG's offense, he
altered it by giving the running backs more presence. Running backs Willie Geter
and Chris Bullock shared time in the backfield and combined for 931 yards,
including 11 rushing touchdowns.

Yet, the Falcons never shied away from their strength: putting the football in
the air.

Ruggiero credits the players for grasping the offensive nuances and executing
them well enough to help the Falcons finish the regular season 7-5."The best
surprise was that the kids learned the offense quickly between spring ball and
game one," Ruggiero said. "We're certainly happy about that and needed it to
happen for us to get seven wins."

Wide receiver Freddie Barnes was among those who adjusted to the changes brought
in with Ruggiero's system.

He thrived like never before as a Falcon wideout, hauling in a nation-leading
and school-record 138 receptions for 1,551 yards, including a national-best 16
touchdowns.

Barnes, a Biletnikoff Award finalist, came through with a season even Ruggiero
didn't foresee.

"I've had guys in my career who've caught over a hundred," Ruggiero said. "I
think once Freddie really caught on to doing a few things and got pretty good at
them, he just kept getting open and Tyler kept throwing the ball to him.

"I knew he'd have a lot, and I told him early on to keep doing what you're doing
and the ball is going to come your way an awful lot. But I don't know if an
awful lot was going to be 138."

Four catches shy of matching the NCAA record, Barnes and Ruggiero's offense will
have a chance to add to their offensive numbers in BG's first-ever appearance in
the Humanitarian Bowl.

committee, signifying the top NCAA Division I center in the nation.

The current list represents changes since the release of the watch list in the
spring. After careful consideration during the offseason and spring practices,
representatives from Division I football programs across the country submitted
nominations to the Rimington Trophy committee and the watch list was created.
These athletes are projected to excel at the center position in the upcoming
season.

Orlosky was named the top center in the nation, heading into the 2016 season, by
USA Today and was earned spots on various All-American and All-Big 12 Conference
teams by preseason publications.

Story continues below video

Orlosky, an All-Big 12 Second Team member from Cleveland, Ohio, started all 13
games last season and saw action on more than 1,000 plays. He helped pave the
way for the offense to average 479.7 yards per game of total offense, 34.0
points, 228.2 rushing yards and 251.5 passing yards. The offense ranked No. 17
nationally in rushing offense, No. 18 in first down offense and No. 23 in total
offense.

Orlosky graded out 90 percent or better in all 13 games last season. The WVU
rushing attack produced 200 or more yards in six games, 300 or more yards in
three games and a season-high 426 yards at Kansas. In the last six games of
2015, the rushing offense averaged 251 yards per game and 499.3 yards of total
offense.

Orlosky is one of only two returning all-conference offensive linemen from 2015
and is the only returning Big 12 lineman listed on the final ranking of the
Schneider Scale (ranked the best 25 lineman in the nation used for the Outland
Trophy).

More shooting for the Stars: Dallas players frustrated by Wings' defence

SOURCE: The Houston Chronicle

BYLINE: Neil Hohlfeld

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. B2

LENGTH: 870 words

DATELINE: DALLAS


In light of Dallas managing 14 mostly pedestrian shots on goal and getting shut
out by the Detroit Red Wings in Game 1 of the Stanley Cup Western Conference
finals, Stars' coach Ken Hitchcock wants to make sure his team doesn't think too
much about offence.

Come again?

It might not be possible for the Stars to concentrate any less on offence than
they did in Sunday's 2-0 loss. But with Dallas facing a must-win game tonight in
Game 2 at Reunion Arena (8 p.m., CBC) Hitchcock warns against the Stars stepping
out of character and attempting to play a wide-open brand of hockey against the
defending Stanley Cup champions.

"If we go out and think offence, offence, offence, then that plays right into
Detroit's hands," Hitchcock said. "Sound defence will lead to scoring chances.
That's the way we play, and that's the way Detroit plays."

Still, Dallas needs a modicum of offence to avoid losing the first two home
games in the best-of-seven series. That might not be easy, considering the Red
Wings are putting on a clinic in how to play a tight defensive system. Though
most casual hockey observers believe the Wings are an offensive-minded team,
that's not the case.

"When they talk about this team, they mention all the offensive threats we
have," said Detroit left-winger Kirk Maltby. "All our offensive threats are
capable of playing good defence at the same time. That's been a key to the
success of the team. We've got a system that everybody has bought into. And when
we play good defence, our offence follows up."

Said Detroit's Brendan Shanahan: "Both teams are thinking defence first and take
pride in that. We have had some offence in the playoffs, but that is a little
deceiving because the truth is we focus on our defence."

During the first two rounds of the playoffs, the Stars went through extended
periods when their offense was missing in action. They scored 25 goals in 11
games against No. 8 seed San Jose and No. 7 Edmonton. With Joe Nieuwendyk out
for the rest of the playoffs with knee injuries, the Red Wings can get away with
concentrating on shutting down Stars' leading scorer Mike Modano.

"Every time he touched the puck, he had sticks on him," said Stars' defenceman
Derian Hatcher. "He was dragging a couple of guys around on his back out there."

In effect, the Red Wings took Modano out of Game 1. He was on the ice for 28
shifts that covered 21 minutes, 53 seconds but managed only two shots on goal.

It was similar to the way the Wings took St. Louis sniper Brett Hull out of the
game in their six-game series win over the Blues.

"They just shut it down in the neutral zone," Modano said. "They're lined up at
the red line. They don't give us the room that we like to have. You have to have
short passes. When you get spread out and try rink-wide passes, that's when they
thrive.

"They don't give you an inch. They backcheck well; they forecheck well; they
always seem to have three or four guys on the blue line. I don't think there's
much we can change. We just have to play harder."

Detroit forward Brent Gilchrist, a former Star, said he thinks Dallas will
follow the advice of its coach and stay away from a run-and-gun attack.

"I don't think they have to open it up; that's not their game," Gilchrist said.
"They'll be real stingy defensively again. But I think these teams are a lot
more alike than people depicted."

One area in which the Stars must improve is their power play. They not only went
0-for-5 in Game 1, but they failed to create any threats during most of their
man-advantage situations. Dallas is 9-for-75 on the power play during the
playoffs and struggled all season while facing the Red Wings' penalty killers.

MATCHING UP

Because the Stars are not matching up well against the Red Wings in
even-strength situations, the power play becomes an even bigger factor.

Hatcher believes the key to clicking on the power play might be for the Stars to
work a little harder.

"I don't know what they were doing to stop us, to be honest," Hatcher said.
"They might have just outworked us."

Throughout the playoffs, the Red Wings have outworked teams on the road. They
are 6-1 away from home, with a six-game road winning streak heading into
tonight's game. Dallas is 5-2 at home and needs to stop Detroit's road streak to
have a shot at winning this series and advancing to the Stanley Cup Finals.

"It's good for us to be starting on the road because of the way we're playing,"
said Detroit's Darren McCarty.

"We have to be stylish. It was the best thing for us."

Said Wings' captain Steve Yzerman: "We have a lot of players who have played a
lot of important games on the road. We feel comfortable. The key is to not press
and not force anything."

For Dallas, it is time to start pressing the issue. Another lacklustre effort
tonight like the one the Stars had in Game 1 will go a long way toward sending
the Red Wings to their third Stanley Cup Finals series in the past four seasons.

"We need to keep our intensity up," Modano said.

"We need to accept the fact that we might be behind at times in this series, and
we need to do it fast. It's a very big game for us to get back into this series.
We can't go to Detroit down 2-0."

NATION IN BRIEF;
Cosby's wife downplays old affair

BYLINE: From news services

SECTION: NATIONAL NEWS; Pg. 06A

LENGTH: 883 words


Bill Cosby's wife Tuesday brushed aside the possibility that he fathered a child
during a long-ago affair. "All old personal negative issues between Bill and me
were resolved years ago. We are a united couple. What occurred 23 years ago is
not important to me except for the current issue of extortion," Camille Cosby,
the comedian's wife of 33 years, said in a statement issued through her
husband's publicist in New York.

Mrs. Cosby said her focus is on finding answers in the Jan. 16 roadside slaying
of her 27-year-old son Ennis. Cosby previously denied he is the father of
22-year-old Autumn Jackson, who was arrested two days after the slaying on
charges of trying to extort $ 24 million from the entertainer by threatening to
go public with her claim to be Cosby's illegitimate daughter.

Meanwhile, Jackson's boyfriend pleaded guilty Tuesday to helping in the alleged
extortion plot by doing research on Cosby and his corporate sponsors, receiving
a document from someone at "The Globe" tabloid, and taking Jackson and Jose
Medina to the airport for a flight to New York.

MILITARY Army sex scandal

A fifth Army instructor has been charged in a sex scandal at Aberdeen Proving
Ground in Maryland. Sgt. 1st Class William Jones, the latest soldier to be
charged, is accused of indecent assault, being drunk while on duty and failing
to obey orders governing the interaction between instructors and students, the
Army said. The Army also announced that Sgt. 1st Class Theron Brown, charged
earlier this month with sodomy and adultery, had requested and was granted a
"discharge in lieu of court- martial." With the discharge, Brown faces no
further prosecution.

CRIME Tots tossed

Two toddlers were hurled out a third-floor apartment window in Tacoma, Wash., as
police responded to a domestic dispute. The children landed on the hood of a
car, but were expected to survive, police said. The children's father, the
subject of several domestic violence complaints, has been arrested for
investigation of two counts of assault, spokeswoman Corina Hopkins said. The
2-year-old girl was in critical condition with head and internal injuries; her
1-year-old brother was in serious condition with bruises and minor internal
injuries. Two homeless people stripped from the waist up and used their clothing
to keep the children warm until help arrived.

Sex, lies and e-mail

A former Oracle Corp. employee was convicted Tuesday of forging an e- mail
message to support her claim that she was fired for breaking off a relationship
with the company's chairman. Larry Ellison, Oracle's chief executive and one of
America's richest people with an estimated net worth of $ 4.2 billion, praised
the verdict as "a sign of great progress in our society." Adelyn Lee, 33, could
spend up to six years in prison for perjury, falsifying evidence and breaking
into a computer network. Her sentencing is set for Feb. 27 in San Mateo County,
Calif., Superior Court.

FBI woes

Three senior FBI agents who evaluated evidence in the Oklahoma City bombing case
have been removed from their jobs in the bureau's crime lab as a result of a
Justice Department investigation, The Associated Press reported. As a result of
problems uncovered by that probe, federal prosecutors have decided against
calling one of the three as an expert witness on explosive residues when Timothy
McVeigh goes on trial in Denver in March in the 1995 truck-bombing that killed
168 people, the AP said, citing officials it did not name.

THE SOUTH Bogus art

A Miami auctioneer canceled a weekend art auction after experts confirmed
accusations that many of the almost 300 works, supposedly by top artists such as
Georgia O'Keeffe and Jasper Johns, were phony. "When I heard the word forgery .
. . forget it, cancel it," veteran estate auctioneer C.B. Charles of Pompano
Beach said. Robert C. Graham Jr., a New York art dealer and a director of the
Art Dealers Association of America, said he had never seen phony art on such a
grand scale, declaring that the promotion for the auction included "an entire
catalog where the sale appears to be obvious fakes."

Anthem retired

The Virginia Senate voted Tuesday to retire the state song, "Carry Me Back to
Old Virginia," because of its references to "darkeys" and "old massa." The 24-15
vote to relegate the tune to "state song emeritus" and set up a commission to
pick a new song came a day after the Senate overwhelmingly backed off a plan to
replace the slurs with "dreamer" and "old Mama."

Sanctuary agreement

A new agreement will let state and federal governments run the Florida Keys
National Marine Sanctuary without undue federal interference with residents,
Gov. Lawton Chiles said.

Stop the Press

The Mobile Press, a 68-year-old afternoon newspaper that had its circulation
heyday in the 1980s, will stop publishing Friday. The newspaper's staff would be
combined with the staff of its sister paper, the morning Mobile Register.

PEOPLE Slimming down

Miss Universe hit the gym in New York City Tuesday, trying to control her
expanding dimensions before the Big Binge turns her career into a black hole.
Since winning the crown in May, 20-year-old Alicia Machado of Venezuela has
clearly added a little padding.

Ex-Wisconsin Badger running back ticketed for drunken driving

BYLINE: By Ed Treleven The Wisconsin State Journal

SECTION: SPORTS; Wisconsin; Crime and Court Stories

LENGTH: 227 words


Former Wisconsin Badgers running back P.J. Hill won't face criminal charges for
a March 14 incident in which he allegedly led police on a short chase while
driving drunk.

Hill, 22, the third-leading rusher in Badgers history, instead was ticketed
Tuesday for first-offense drunken driving, reckless driving, refusing to take a
Breathalyzer test and driving without headlights.

He is scheduled to appear in court on Monday.

The first-offense drunken driving charge could become a second-offense,
depending upon when another first-offense drunken driving charge, which Hill
faces in Arizona, is resolved. While a first offense in Wisconsin is punishable
by fines and a license revocation, a second offense carries a minimum five days
in jail along with fines and a license revocation.

Hill left UW-Madison and decided to forego his senior year of eligibility to
enter the National Football League draft. He was arrested by university police
on tentative felony charges after he allegedly crashed into a guard rail at the
Open Pantry store on Regent Street, then led police on a chase back to his
apartment. The chase ended when he crashed his car into a retaining wall.

In addition to the tickets in Madison, Hill still faces charges in Scottsdale,
Ariz., that include drunken driving, unreasonable speed and making unsafe lane
changes for an incident there in early March.

Raiders 'O' among NFL's worst since 1960;
A bright spot for Oakland, however, is that it secured No. 1 draft status

SECTION: Pg. F4

LENGTH: 697 words

Raiders notebook

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- It wasn't exactly 1977 Tampa Bay Buccaneers bad, but
the Raiders offense secured its place among the most inept in league history
with its 3-point outburst against the New York Jets on Sunday.

The Raiders finished with a league-worst 168 points in 16 games (10.5 average).
That left them 76 shy of surpassing the next-worst Raiders output (15.2 in 1962)
in the team's 47-year history.

Only 138 of those points came via offense. Given that, the Raiders' 8.6
offensive points per game ranks as the seventh-worst leaguewide since they began
play in 1960. The '77 Buccaneers (5.4 avg.) set the benchmark, with the '74
Atlanta Falcons (6.9) the only other team under 7 points per game.

"We've got to catch up to the defense," running back Zack Crockett said. "We
know the areas where we need to get better at. Now it's time to just do it.

The Raiders offense finished last in the league in points per game, total
offense, passing offense, sacks allowed and several other pertinent statistical
categories.

Coach Art Shell replaced offensive coordinator Tom Walsh with John Shoop after
11 games. The Raiders moved the ball better under Shoop but scored at an even
worse clip.

The Raiders averaged 11 points under Walsh's guidance, 7.2 under Shoop's
stewardship.

Against the Jets, the Raiders once again were beset by turnovers. Three drives
ended with turnovers. Two others came via failed attempts at converting
fourth-down plays.

We're No. 1

The Raiders gained a measure of satisfaction from their season of despair by
winding up with the rights to the top pick in the NFL draft in April.

They entered the game tied with the Detroit Lions in the dreaded chase for the
No. 1 pick. However, the Lions held a considerable edge in the tiebreaking
procedure in case the teams wound up with identical records.

That turned into a moot point with the Raiders losing and the Lions beating the
Dallas Cowboys 39-31.

"I didn't know Detroit wanted to give that up," defensive tackle Warren Sapp
said, with a hearty laugh.

The Raiders have been in this position only once before in their 47-year
history. They selected quarterback Roman Gabriel at No. 1 overall in the 1962
American Football League draft, but he opted to play for the Los Angeles Rams in
the NFL.

Overturned Carr

Second-year kick returner Chris Carr has bemoaned his inability to take back a
kick all the way. He has been "one block away" numerous times this season.

On Sunday, he came 1-yard shy of scoring his first touchdown on a kick return.
Yet, he didn't get to enjoy his near-miss for very long. Jarrod Cooper got
called for holding on the third-quarter return. The infraction negated Carr's
92-yard return and gave the Raiders the ball at their own 18-yard line.

"When it happened, I couldn't believe it," Carr said. "I said if I break a big
one, I'm probably No. 1 in the NFL (in kick return average). ... The whole
season has been thoroughly frustrating."

For the record, Cooper said he got beat by the player he was accused of holding
and his efforts had nothing to do with springing Carr into the open field.

Road kill

The Raiders lost for the eighth straight time away from the Coliseum this
season. That extended their streak to 11 consecutive road losses and marked the
second time in four seasons (2003) they failed to win any away games.

Extra points

Raiders wide receiver Johnnie Morant had his most productive game as a pro. He
caught three passes for 24 yards. However, he fumbled at the end of his first
reception. He also fumbled at the end of his final reception in Oakland's
previous game, against the Kansas City Chiefs on Dec. 23. ... Sapp notched his
10th sack in the first quarter. He reached double digits in sacks for the fourth
time in his 12-year career and first since he posted a career-high 161/2 in 2000
for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Sapp finished one behind team-leader Derrick
Burgess. ... The Raiders committed three more turnovers and finished with 46 in
16 games. Their takeaway-giveaway differential was a league-worst minus-23. ...
Raiders receiver Randy Moss (ankle) and cornerback Tyrone Poole were among the
eight players deactivated for Sunday's game.

MCKEESPORT'S NO-HUDDLE OFFENSE GIVING OPPONENTS FITS

BYLINE: MIKE WHITE, PITTSBURGH POST-GAZETTE

SECTION: SPORTS; FOOTBALL NOTEBOOK; Pg. E-6

LENGTH: 554 words


McKeesport's offense is turning back the clock. Now the Tigers can only hope
history repeats itself.

For the past two games, McKeesport has used the no-huddle offense -- and it has
worked well. According to McKeesport coach George Smith, the last time the
Tigers used the no-huddle was 1994. That was the year McKeesport won the PIAA
and WPIAL Class AAAA championships.

McKeesport is two wins away from winning another PIAA title after the Tigers
knocked off Erie Cathedral Prep, 42-7, in a quarterfinal game Saturday night.
Erie Prep had no answer for the no-huddle offense.

"We went to the no-huddle against Woodland Hills [in the WPIAL final]," Smith
said. "We did it because Woodland Hills likes to switch defenses on you so
much."

McKeesport had success with the offense against Woodland Hills, so the Tigers
decided to stick with it against Erie Prep. With the no-huddle offense, teams
can't make defensive substitutions.

"You have to play assignment football against them, and if you play assignment
football, you can't have any breakdowns," Erie Prep coach Don Holl said.
"Against [McKeesport], you get a guy there to make the tackle, and they make you
miss. Then you get a guy somewhere else, and they run through the tackle."

McKeesport (12-2) plays Harrisburg Bishop McDevitt (13-0) in a semifinal at 1
p.m. Saturday at Mansion Park Stadium in Altoona.

In the quarterfinals, Bishop McDevitt defeated State College, 20-17, in a game
that wasn't as close as the final score indicates. State College's final
touchdown came with one second left. In the first half, Bishop McDevitt had 16
first downs and 239 total yards to two first downs and 12 yards for State
College. But Bishop McDevitt missed three field goals.

State College finished the season 9-4 and its four losses were by a total of
nine points.

It's over for Devlin

The most prolific passer in Pennsylvania high school history saw his career end
Friday night when Downingtown East lost to North Penn, 55-20, in the District 1
championship. Downingtown East quarterback Pat Devlin completed only 7 of 25
passes for 95 yards. Devlin, a University of Miami recruit who holds the state
record for career passing yards, finished with 8,162 career yards.

North Penn rambled for 490 rushing yards. Devlin, though, had 131 yards rushing
on 16 attempts.

Them again

Southern Columbia is in the Class A semifinals for the 12th consecutive year
after defeating Schuylkill Haven, 31-6. Southern Columbia, the three-time
defending PIAA champion, finished with 378 yards rushing.

Two in three days

Frankford, the Philadelphia Public League champion, played two games in three
days and neither went well.

On Thanksgiving day, Frankford lost, 12-0, to previously winless Philadelphia
North Catholic. Two days later in the PIAA Class AAAA quarterfinals, Frankford
was crushed by Bethlehem Liberty, 42-6,

Top performances

* Bishop Carroll was averaging 235 yards rushing a game, but had only 44 on 23
attempts in a 36-20 loss to Steelton-Highspire in a Class A quarterfinal.

* Steelton-Highspire freshman Jeremiah Young rushed for 139 yards against Bishop
Carroll.

* Manheim Central quarterback Brandon Miller rushed for 190 yards on 15 carries
and completed 7 of 8 passes for 117 yards in a 48-21 victory against Muhlenberg.

* Pete Stoll of North Penn had 238 yards rushing against Downingtown East.

High-powered offenses collide

BYLINE: Standard-Examiner, Ogden, Utah

SECTION: SPORTS

LENGTH: 575 words


May 19--SALT LAKE CITY -- The Utah Blaze return home tonight to face off against
the Arizona Rattlers at EnergySolutions Arena.

The matchup features significant playoff implications, as each team looks to
gain ground in the race for the West Division crown.

The Blaze (6-3) suffered its first defeat in five games last Friday, falling to
the San Jose SaberCats on the road, 70-59. On the same weekend, the Rattlers
(6-3) knocked off the Chicago Rush, 77-43.

With identical records, the winner of the Blaze versus Rattlers will claim sole
possession of second place in the division.

Utah will be charged with the task of stopping the 2011 National Guard MVP of
the Year in Rattlers QB Nick Davila, who through nine games, has thrown for
2,648 yards with 57 touchdowns. Davila's favorite target is WR Maurice Purify,
the 2011 Rookie of the Year who has accounted for 1,112 yards and 26 scores.

Arizona ranks second in the AFL in total offense (328.1 ypg), as well as third
in scoring (64.8 ppg) and passing offense (305.0 ypg).

"The Arizona Rattlers possess one of the best offenses in the AFL," said Utah
coach Ron James. "Their quarterback and wide receiver corps have been
exceptional all season. We need to find a way to limit their production this
week in order to be successful."

The Blaze defense must get back to doing what it does best -- pressuring the
quarterback. "Sack City" has been relatively quiet over the past three games,
but is always a threat to wreak havoc in the backfield. Davila has thrown nine
interceptions on the season, which is the fifth-highest total in the AFL. If
Utah can force errant throws, the Blaze will have a strong opportunity to gain
extra possessions off of turnovers.

"We have been working hard all week on getting our pass rush back in gear,"
James said. "This is the type of game in which we need to pressure the
quarterback and make it difficult for the Arizona offense to be efficient."

Of course, keeping up with Arizona's offense is also critical to coming away
with a victory, but there may not be a unit better equipped to do so than the
Blaze. Utah's offense has been shredding opposing defenses, averaging over 68
points during its last five games. Over that span, QB Tommy Grady has tossed 46
touchdowns and just two interceptions.

Grady has a wide array of weapons at his disposal, including WR Aaron Lesue, who
leads the league in scoring (20.9 ppg) and touchdown receptions (31). WR Shaun
Kauleinamoku has played in just two games with the Blaze, but has already
developed a strong rapport with Grady. In limited action, Kauleinamoku has
hauled in 19 passes for 267 yards and nine touchdowns.

Last but certainly not least, WR Alvance Robinson continues to be a significant
contributor capable of moving the chains, recording 60 receptions for 816 yards
and 13 scores in seven games.

Arizona ranks 14th in total defense (319.8 ypg) and passing defense (305.0 ypg),
but has been effective in keeping points off the board. The unit ranks fourth in
the AFL in scoring, allowing just 50.4 points per game.

The Rattlers feature a solid corps of defensive lineman, led by nose guard
Anttaj Hawthorne, who leads the group with 4.5 sacks. Mack Linebacker Cliff
Dukes will also return to the lineup this week after spending the past month and
a half on injured reserve.

U.S. Supreme Court rules drug crime sentences not determined by state law

BYLINE: Lawyers USA Staff

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 492  words


A drug crime classified as a misdemeanor by state law, but punishable by more
than one year's imprisonment, constitutes a "felony drug offense" under the
federal Controlled Substances Act, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled in a
unanimous opinion. A defendant pleaded guilty in federal court to conspiracy to
possess with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of cocaine base. Under the
Controlled Substances Act, he was subject to a mandatory minimum 10-year
sentence.

The defendant had previously been convicted under South Carolina law of
possessing cocaine, which was classified by the state as a misdemeanor despite
its maximum sentence of two years imprisonment.

The government sought to enhance the defendant's sentence to 20 years under the
federal statute, arguing that his prior conviction constituted a "felony drug
offense. " Under the Act, a "felony drug offense" is defined as an offense
involving specified drugs that is "punishable by imprisonment for more than one
year" by federal or state law.

The defendant objected to the enhancement of his sentence, arguing that his
prior crime couldn't be a felony drug offense because it failed to meet the
definition of "felony" under the Act - an "offense classified by applicable
federal or state law as a felony. " Because his crime was classified as a
misdemeanor by the state, he contended his sentence couldn't be increased.

But the Supreme Court disagreed, affirming the 4th Circuit in an opinion by
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

"The government's reading, we are convinced, correctly interprets the statutory
text and context. ... 'Statutory definitions control the meaning of statutory
words...in the usual case. ' The [Act], to be sure, also defines the term
'felony. ' The language and structure of the statute, however, indicate that
Congress used the phrase 'felony drug offense' as a term of art defined by [the
Act] without reference to [the definition of 'felony']. ...

"First, Congress stated that '[t]he term 'felony drug offense' means an offense
that is punishable by imprisonment for more than one year. ' 'As a rule, [a]
definition which declares what a term 'means'... excludes any meaning that is
not stated. ' Second, the term 'felony' is commonly defined to mean a crime
punishable by imprisonment for more than one year. [The Act's] definition of
'felony drug offense' as 'an offense ... punishable by imprisonment for more
than one year,' in short, leaves no blank to be filled," the Court said.

The justices said that to accept the defendant's argument would be to create
uncertainty and a lack of uniformity in the courts because "some states and many
foreign jurisdictions do not label offenses as felonies or misdemeanors. [The
defendant's] compound definition of 'felony drug offense' leaves unanswered the
appropriate classification of drug convictions in those jurisdictions. "

NATION IN BRIEF King trial juror says stress keeps him from working

SECTION: NATIONAL NEWS; Section B; Page 5

LENGTH: 680 words


A federal juror in the Rodney King beating trial in Los Angeles became the first
to reveal his identity, and he said the ordeal of the trial has kept him from
returning to work. Martin De La Rosa, who allowed his name to be published in
The San Bernardino County Sun, said he suffers from sleeplessness, fatigue and
appetite loss from the 2-month- long trial, which ended last month with two
policemen convicted and two acquitted.

Mr. De La Rosa, 29, of Riverside also said the convicted police officers - Sgt.
Stacey Koon and Officer Laurence Powell - deserve some leniency. "They've been
through two years of hell," he said in the interview published Wednesday.

"Two people are going to prison. That's nothing to cheer about," said Mr. De La
Rosa, a retail clerk. "I felt bad for them going to jail. But I went in and did
my job." Sentencing is scheduled in August.

CRIME

TRUCKER ACQUITTED: A Texas trucker who blamed faulty brakes for an accident with
a school bus that killed 21 students was acquitted of criminal negligence
charges. Prosecutors in Edinburg had argued that Ruben Perez wasn't paying
attention when his truck rig ran a stop sign Sept. 21, 1989, and smashed into a
school bus, sending it careening over a 40-foot ledge into a flooded pit where
the 21 victims drowned. Mr. Perez, 29, was at first charged with 21 counts of
involuntary manslaughter, but during the trial District Judge Fidencio Guerra
Jr. reduced that to criminally negligent homicide.

-PRIEST ADMITS GUILT: A retired Roman Catholic priest pleaded guilty in Newport,
Ky., to charges of sexually abusing six boys between 1965 and 1980. Earl
Bierman, 61, pleaded guilty to 25 counts of sodomy and indecent behavior. One
other count, involving intimidation of a witness, was dropped. Prosecutor Louis
Ball recommended a 20-year prison term for Bierman, who remained in jail under a
$ 125,000 bond. Campbell County Circuit Judge William Wehr scheduled sentencing
for June 23.

COURTS

DINOSAUR DUEL: The maker of Barney, the lovable toy dinosaur, claims that a New
Jersey company is illegally cashing in on its trademark. Lyons Partnership of
Allen, Texas, has gone to court to ban the sale of Dino- Buddy, a purple
dinosaur doll marketed by Kids of America Corp. of Fairfield. "Like Barney, the
Dino-Buddies have purple bodies with a swath of green down their chest and
stomach," said the lawsuit, filed April 23 in U.S. District Court in Newark,
N.J. "Like Barney, the Dino-Buddies have open mouths, a strip of white fabric
around the edges of the mouth resembling teeth, and yellow toes." The company is
seeking at least $ 100,000 for each alleged copyright violation and more money
for damages for alleged unfair competition and trademark infringements. Barney,
who started out on video, is the brainchild of two Dallas-area educators and
mothers. The "Barney & Friends" TV show has been a hit on public television.

MILITARY

WELCOME BACK: Navy officials are angry about the nude reception San Diego
strippers gave to four ships of returning sailors, many of whom had family
members aboard with them. The manager of a strip club apologized for sending his
dancers out on two yachts to welcome home sailors returning from a six-month
deployment. Navy officials, still smarting from the Tailhook sex abuse scandal,
denounced the action. Capt. James Maslowski of the USS Kitty Hawk called the
strip act "totally inappropriate." The children on board were part of a Navy
program that allows sailors' relatives to board ships docking in Hawaii and sail
the rest of the way home to California. Lt. Cmdr. Frank Thorp, a Navy spokesman,
said one of the yachts carrying the strippers was removed from the area around
the 32nd Street Naval Station by Harbor Patrol boats.

POLITICS

BLACK APPOINTED: Democrat H. Carl McCall was sworn in as New York state
comptroller, becoming the first black to hold a statewide elective office in the
nation's second-largest state. Republican lawmakers promised a legal challenge
to his selection as New York's chief fiscal watchdog.

Washington: The FBI Releases 2013 Crime Statistics for Washington State

LENGTH: 1015  words

DATELINE: Washington


US Federal Bureau of Investigation, The Government of USA has issued the
following news release:

Today, the FBI released its annual Crime in the United States report for
American cities. Nationally, the estimated number of violent crimes decreased
4.4 percent in 2013 when compared with 2012 data. Property crimes decreased 4.1
percent, marking the 11th straight year the collective estimates for property
crime offenses declined.

The UCR Program collects information on crimes reported by law enforcement
agencies regarding the violent crimes of murder and non-negligent manslaughter,
rape, robbery, and aggravated assault, as well as the property crimes of
burglary, larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft, and arson. (Although the FBI
classifies arson as a property crime, it does not estimate arson data because of
variations in the level of participation by the reporting agencies.
Consequently, arson is not included in the property crime estimate.) The program
also collects arrest data for the offenses listed above plus 20 offenses that
include all other crimes except traffic violations.

Highlights from cities with populations of more than 100,000 people in
Washington--comparing 2013 to 2012--are:

The rate of violent crime for Washington's cities decreased from 295.6 offenses
per 100,000 city inhabitants to 289.1. Nationally, the estimated rate of violent
crime was 367.9 offenses per 100,000 city inhabitants.

For specific information on other cities within Washington, please refer to the
attached crime table or access it online here. Also attached is a portion of the
crime statistics by state, showing crimes in Washington by population groups.

To compare those statistics with other states, view Table 5 online.

Across the nation, more than 18,400 city, county, state, federal,
college/university, and tribal law enforcement agencies voluntarily contribute
data to this annual report.

The FBI simply compiles the information as it is provided from local
jurisdictions. You will need to contact those local jurisdictions for any
analysis of the numbers listed above. Also note that the report features a
prominent message cautioning against using the statistics to rank cities or
counties. Such rankings can lead to simplistic or incomplete analyses,
overlooking the many variables impacting crime and its reporting.

The FBI has been producing the Uniform Crime Report since 1930. There are
numerous other combinations of the 2013 data posted online here.

*Note: In many cases, the reader should not compare the number of rapes in 2012
to those in 2013. The FBI changed the definition of rape and, thus, the
reporting from one year to the next is not comparable for cities that used the
legacy definition for 2012 and the new definition for 2013.

Prior to 2013, the FBI's UCR Program collected rape data in the Summary
Reporting System under the category "forcible rape." In 2013, the Program
removed the term "forcible" from the title, and revised the definition. The
legacy UCR definition of rape is "The carnal knowledge of a female forcibly and
against her will." The revised UCR definition of rape is "Penetration, no matter
how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral
penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the
victim."

Washington: The FBI Releases 2013 Crime Statistics for Washington State

LENGTH: 1015  words

DATELINE: Washington


US Federal Bureau of Investigation, The Government of USA has issued the
following news release:

Today, the FBI released its annual Crime in the United States report for
American cities. Nationally, the estimated number of violent crimes decreased
4.4 percent in 2013 when compared with 2012 data. Property crimes decreased 4.1
percent, marking the 11th straight year the collective estimates for property
crime offenses declined.

The UCR Program collects information on crimes reported by law enforcement
agencies regarding the violent crimes of murder and non-negligent manslaughter,
rape, robbery, and aggravated assault, as well as the property crimes of
burglary, larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft, and arson. (Although the FBI
classifies arson as a property crime, it does not estimate arson data because of
variations in the level of participation by the reporting agencies.
Consequently, arson is not included in the property crime estimate.) The program
also collects arrest data for the offenses listed above plus 20 offenses that
include all other crimes except traffic violations.

Highlights from cities with populations of more than 100,000 people in
Washington--comparing 2013 to 2012--are:

The rate of violent crime for Washington's cities decreased from 295.6 offenses
per 100,000 city inhabitants to 289.1. Nationally, the estimated rate of violent
crime was 367.9 offenses per 100,000 city inhabitants.
 The rate of property crime for Washington's cities increased slightly from
3,658.6 offenses per 100,000 city inhabitants to 3,710.3. Nationally, the
estimated rate of property crimes was 2,730.7 offenses per 100,000 inhabitants.
These rates do not include arsons.
 In Seattle, there was a sizable decrease in the number of aggravated assaults.
There were four less murders and non-negligent manslaughters.
 In Bellevue, there were sizable decreases in the numbers of rapes, robberies,
and aggravated assaults.
 In Everett, there were sizable decreases in the numbers of rapes, aggravated
assaults, burglaries, and arsons.
 In Kent, there were sizable decreases in the numbers of robberies, aggravated
assaults, and burglaries.
 In Spokane, there was a sizable decrease in the number of robberies. There were
two less murders and non-negligent manslaughters
 In Tacoma, there were two less murders and non-negligent manslaughters.
 In Vancouver, there were sizable decreases in the numbers of robberies,

WVU new-look offense on display

BYLINE: Tony Dobies

LENGTH: 427 words


MORGANTOWN, W.Va. ? When West Virginia opened spring practice, it wasn't only
fans who were intrigued to see how 2011 would turn out.

After an offseason of turmoil that included the departure of the offensive
coaching staff and Dana Holgorsen's arrival as offensive coordinator, the
players were filled with skepticism, too.

"I was interested to see what this new offense had to offer. I heard when he was
at Oklahoma State he did a lot of big things," said sophomore receiver Stedman
Bailey.

Mountaineers fans will get a preview of that offense at 7:30 tonight during the
Mountaineers' Gold-Blue Spring Game at Milan Puskar Stadium.

"I hope it looks all right. We don't want to have 18 penalties and 18 sacks. We
don't want to have to punt. ... The fans aren't coming to see them kick the ball
20 times," Holgorsen said. "I'm sure the guys are pretty excited. The guys get
tired of practicing, which is just the nature, but when you get a live event
with people in the stands, they'll probably get pretty cranked up for it."

Since 2002, a Holgorsen-coached offense ? whether at Texas Tech, Houston or
Oklahoma State ? finished 10th or better in passing and scoring all but once
(13th in scoring offense in 2006). In that span, Holgorsen's teams have finished
first in passing, total or scoring offense nine times.

Those numbers are what helped speed up what could've been a tricky transition,
Holgorsen said.

"It's easier when they look at Oklahoma State tape, and it looks good," he said.
"If they want that to be them, then they probably should buy in and try to get
good at it. It's not just going to happen."

Junior quarterback Geno Smith has led the offense through the transition.

"I'm excited, and I look forward to the future," Smith said. "We're going to
progress through the summer and hopefully be at top shape come the fall."

It hasn't been a necessarily easy spring. At times, the offensive line has
struggled to stop the Mountaineers' defense and hasn't been able to develop
depth at many positions because of multiple injuries.

Still, the players are beginning to see the potential.

"(The coaches) bring in that energy that makes you want to get better, that
makes you want to work harder. And it's fun while we're doing that," receiver
Brad Starks said. "I'm excited. There are endless opportunities and
possibilities with this offense."

The defense has even seen the differences in the offense.

"This new offense is going to be the best thing for our defense," cornerback Pat
Miller said. "What we're seeing this spring a lot of teams never see."

Attack victim leaves N.Y. for recovery
A woman bashed in the head with a stone on a Manhattan street last month left
the hospital Friday to spend the holidays with her family in Texas and continue
her recovery with their help.

Nicole Barrett, 27, has had brain surgery twice since the Nov. 16 attack. She
suffers headaches and has problems with her speech and decision-making, said her
mother, Sharon Barrett.

Nicole Barrett was hit from behind with a 6-pound paving stone in the middle of
the day near Grand Central Terminal.

A panhandler, Paris Drake, 34, was arrested and charged Dec. 1 with attempted
murder. Authorities said he hit Barrett after becoming upset over how little
money he had gotten that day.

Tonight is last chance of year to launch shuttle
Rain at Cape Canaveral, Fla., forced NASA to call off Friday night's launch of
space shuttle Discovery and its seven-man crew on a mission to fix the Hubble
Space Telescope. It was the eighth delay and cost NASA $ 750,000 in fuel and
overtime pay. Launch managers said they would try again tonight, their last
attempt before giving up for the year.

Woman who kept snakes dies from bite at home
A zoo volunteer who kept 10 poisonous snakes in her Van Nuys, Calif., mobile
home died of a bite from one and was found by police with a note for help
clenched in her severely swollen hand. The note in Anita Finch's hand read,
"Northridge Hospital --- Ask for ICU." Finch, 33, had nearly finished an animal
keeper's training course at the Los Angeles Zoo and was on her way to becoming a
full-time employee there, said Michael Dee, the zoo's general curator.
Authorities killed her snakes.

forcible sodomy, breaking and entering, disobeying a lawful order and
dereliction of duty. He received a dishonorable discharge, was demoted to
private and must forfeit all pay.

Manslaughter claimed in fatal carnival ride
The owners and inspectors of an Austin, Texas, carnival ride have been charged
with manslaughter in the death of a 15-year-old girl who was hurled out.
Officials of Yuma, Ariz.-based B&B Amusements and the Florida inspection company
Bob Gill and Associates were accused of "recklessly" causing Leslie Lane's death

POLICE BLOTTER;
Police seek suspects in attempted robbery of barbershop

BYLINE: Ralph Ellis; STAFF WRITER

SECTION: EXTRA; Pg. 04M

LENGTH: 570 words


Fayetteville police have made no arrests in the Dec. 4 armed robbery attempt at
Rich's Barber Shop on South Glynn Street.

Doug Rich, owner of the shop, told police that two men entered the store
displaying a weapon and telling Rich and his wife, Deborah, not to move.

One of the men fired two rounds, and Rich said he tried to fire his own gun but
it jammed. The men fled and Rich chased them and fired some shots, Rich told
police.

No one was reported injured and nothing was stolen. Lt. Steve Ledbetter of the
Fayetteville Police Department said several residents reported seeing two men
fitting the description of the robbers running through nearby back yards.

Ledbetter said several slugs fired by the two men were found in the walls of the
barbershop and could be used as evidence.

SUSPECTS NABBED AFTER CHASE: Two people who were arrested last week after a
chase on I-85 in Coweta County are also wanted by authorities in Peach-tree
City, Forsyth County and Blount County, Ala.

Donald Christopher Bowden, 23, and Jessica Nicole Scoggin, 21, both of Coweta
County, are charged with three counts of burglary each, said Coweta Sheriff Mike
Yeager. Bowden also is charged with possession of a firearm by a convicted
felon, and Scoggin is charged with forgery.

Officers had a lookout for the pair and chased them down I-85 on Dec. 3 until
the suspects' car bumped a Georgia state trooper's car and ran down an
embankment, Yeager said.

The chase hit speeds of about 100 mph, the sheriff said. Both suspects were
treated at local hospitals and then jailed.

Yeager said the car was stolen from Peachtree City but carried a Tennessee tag.
Authorities in Alabama and Forsyth County also want to question Bowden and
Scoggin about burglaries, he said.

SHARPSBURG MAN CHARGED IN ARMED ROBBERY: Renwick Hardy of Sharpsburg has been
charged with a second count of armed robbery, the Coweta County Sheriff's
Department reported.

Sheriff Mike Yeager said Hardy was charged with the June 21 robbery of the
Greenway Amoco at Thomas Crossroads after a clerk identified him from a photo
lineup. Hardy had been charged earlier with the Nov. 26 armed robbery of the
Flash Foods-Phillips 66 at Thomas Crossroads.

Yeager said the robber used a knife in both cases.

PARKING VIOLATION LEADS TO MORE CHARGES: Thomas James Blandburg, 27, of
Peachtree Station was charged Dec. 4 with two counts of disorderly conduct,
resisting arrest and handicap parking violation. Peachtree City police said
officers were trying to cite Blandburg for parking in a handicapped spot when he
resisted arrest and became violent with an officer.

PEACHTREE CITY BURGLARIES INVESTIGATED: Peachtree City police are investigating
several thefts from houses. A resident of the Wingspread subdivision reported
that 50 personal checks and a .38-caliber pistol were taken between Nov. 23 and
Dec. 3. A resident of Enclave reported that a 12-gauge shotgun was taken between
Nov. 30 and Dec. 6. A house under construction on Sea Island Drive was broken
into Dec. 2 or Dec. 3 and 38 rolls of wallpaper and a wallpaper pasting machine
were stolen, police said.

TWO CARS BROKEN INTO: Two cars were broken into last weekend in Peachtree City.
Police said a purse containing numerous forms of identification was taken from a
car on Fountain Head. A stereo CD player and a large number of CDs were taken
from a car on Wildwood Court.

LIONS' OFFENSE IS CLICKING LIKE IT'S 1994

BYLINE: Ron Musselman, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette

SECTION: SPORTS; PENN STATE; Pg. D-10

LENGTH: 538 words


Penn State's prolific offense overpowered teams in 1994, piling up eye-popping
numbers.

After two easy victories against Coastal Carolina and Oregon State, the
17th-ranked Nittany Lions' offense has rekindled memories of that magical season
14 years ago.

In '94, Penn State led the country in scoring (47.8 points per game) and total
offense (520.2 yards per game) en route to a 12-0 record and a runner-up finish
to No. 1 Nebraska. Coach Joe Paterno still disputes the final ranking.

The Lions set a plethora of records that season, shattering 14 team and 19
individual marks. They also produced five first-team All-Americans. They
included four eventual No. 1 NFL draft picks (tailback Ki-Jana Carter,
quarterback Kerry Collins, tight end Kyle Brady and guard/center Jeff Hartings)
and a second-rounder (wide receiver Bobby Engram).

"We were probably as good an offensive team in a tough league as anybody who
ever played," Paterno said.

This year's offense may not have any bona fide All-American players, but they do
have plenty of playmakers.

The Lions rank third in the country in scoring offense (55.5 points per game),
eighth in rushing offense (286.5 yards per game) and the offensive line has yet
to allow a sack.

Meanwhile, the offense has scored at least 35 first-half points in each of the
first two games, marking the first time that has happened since the '94 team
racked up 35 or more in its first three games.

Penn State has outscored its first two opponents, 111-24, while producing 16
plays of 20 yards or longer. The '94 team rang up 564 points overall, including
the Rose Bowl win against Oregon, and allowed only 252.

Paterno said it is way too early to compare the two offenses.

"I can't get excited until we've had some adversity," he said. "These guys have
got to do some things when things aren't going right. Maybe we don't do well on
the road in hostile environments. I don't know yet.

"But, for me to compare it to the '94 team now would be very, very premature."

Penn State has a combined 1,048 yards offense and 14 touchdowns -- 11 rushing
and three passing. Those gaudy statistics likely will improve the next two
weeks. The Lions play Syracuse (0-2) Saturday in the Carrier Dome before
returning home to face Temple (1-1) the following week.

Tailback Evan Royster, a highly recruited high school lacrosse player from
Fairfax, Va., who had college offers from perennial lacrosse powers Johns
Hopkins and Virginia, has emerged as the go-to guy. He has a team-high 205 of
the team's 573 rushing yards on 25 carries.

Quarterback Daryll Clark has completed 67.6 percent of his passes (25 of 37) for
361 yards and three scores. He is the fifth-leading rusher with 61 yards on five
carries, a 12.2 average.

*

NOTES -- Outside linebacker Tyrell Sales, a Butler High School graduate, had a
career-high 10 tackles Saturday, including nine solo. ... Penn State announced
yesterday that defensive end Jerome Hayes will miss the remainder of the season
after the ACL in his left knee was torn Saturday. Hayes will have surgery within
the next 2-3 weeks and rehabilitation will take approximately nine months.

Up next

* Game: Penn State (2-0) at Syracuse (0-2), 3:30 p.m. Saturday.

* Where: Carrier Dome, Syracuse, N.Y.

UCF (3-1, 1-0 C-USA) AT EAST CAROLINA (2-3, 1-1), 7:30 P.M.

LENGTH: 287 words


The Pirates have won five of six meetings in this series, but these Knights are
off to their best start since 1998 ending a three-game homestand with a 37-19
win last week over Louisiana-Lafayette. UCF brings in a top-notch offense led by
the country's leading rusher in junior Kevin Smith (178.4 ypg), who is coming
off a career best 223 yards and three touchdowns. The Knights rank seventh
nationally in rushing offense (252.7 ypg), but rank No. 102 in passing offense
(170.2 ypg). ECU registered a big win last week taking down defending C-USA
champion Houston, 37-35.

Troy (3-2, 2-0) at FIU (0-5, 0-1), 7 p.m.

The Golden Panthers rank 119th nationally in rushing defense, which has the Troy
offense salivating. Trojans quarterback Omar Haugabook rushed for 111 yards
against FIU last season, and he's already thrown for 1,443 passing yards. FIU's
offensive struggles continued in a 47-7 loss last week at Middle Tennessee
State. The Golden Panthers used three quarterbacks last week who combined for 73
yards passing and two interceptions. The offense is dead last nationally in
scoring offense (5.6 ppg), total yards (188.2) and passing efficiency (65.8
percent).

FAMU (2-2, 1-1 MEAC) vs. Winston-Salem State (2-3, 2-2) (at Indianapolis), 5
p.m.

Albert Chester II's surprise decision to quit football stunned the Rattlers, who
have turned to Leon Camel as their new starting quarterback. Chester said in a
statement he sustained several injuries to his right (throwing) arm and after
discussions with family members and his physician decided to quit football for
fear of the long-term effects. Camel gets his second career start and has
completed 9 of 23 passes for 115 yards and a touchdown, including two rushing
scores.

WEST COAST STATE OF MIND;
CARROLL LOOKING FORWARD TO MATCHING WITS WITH CALLAHAN

BYLINE: BY SCOTT WOLF Staff Writer

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. S1

LENGTH: 661 words


There are ways to earn USC coach Pete Carroll's respect. Simply coaching in the
NFL does not necessarily guarantee it.

But if you have the right NFL pedigree, it vaults you to the top of USC
opponents, owing to Carroll's continued opinion that pro football is the sport
``at its highest level.''

Nebraska might bring 30,000 fans to the Coliseum today, but Carroll will be more
concerned about the methods Cornhuskers coach Bill Callahan brings with his
playbook.

Carroll was weaned on the original West Coast offense used by the San Francisco
49ers in the early 1980s, and the 19th- ranked Cornhuskers employ a version he
routinely battled in the NFL.

That alone makes the Cornhuskers (2-0) a formidable opponent for the
fourth-ranked Trojans (1-0), at least in Carroll's mind.

``This is really cool. This is great stuff,'' Carroll said. ``I know that
offense really well. That's important because we only play one time a year in
college. In the NFL, we would see it twice a year and make adjustments. And
Nebraska is loaded.''

This game reminds Carroll of playing the Denver Broncos or Seattle Seahawks,
teams that employ an offense similar to Nebraska's.

``(Callahan's) background is out of the new-age stuff,'' Carroll said. ``It's
the new West Coast offense, from (NFL coaches) Mike Shanahan and Mike Holmgren.
I know the whole lineage.''

He can also see some of the best parts of Nebraska's offense at USC.

``There is some of that stuff in our offense,'' Carroll said.

All of this makes this game more of a challenge than twoweeks ago, when the
Trojans faced the one-dimensional offense of Arkansas coach Houston Nutt.

Callahan labeled the contest ``an opportunity to match wits.''

He brings a team that can pass (569 yards) and run (513yards) equally well, and
those are the teams that often give the Trojans trouble, with Texas and Fresno
State two examples from last season.

Callahan views today's game as a chance to see how quickly Nebraska has
progressed from the option offense that flourished under former coach Tom
Osborne.

``A lot of the kids, and God bless them, they're great kids, really were not
suited for a pro-style attack, so it's taken some time to develop the depth and
the talent that you need to compete with this type of system on a national
basis,'' Callahan said. ``So we're still a ways away. But we're making great
strides, and this will be a test of where we are at.

``It certainly won't define the season, but it will be a game we'll utilize for
improvement and we'll get better, no matter what the outcome.''

It could be a game to define USC's season. The Trojans, despite offseason losses
and injuries to key defensive players, remain prime contenders for the national
championship. Early losses are not fatal, but because this USC team is so young,
every victory builds confidence and keeps up the aura that surrounds the
program.

``We want everyone to know that we haven't dropped off,'' freshman tailback
Emmanuel Moody said. ``I came here to play in games like this one and be the
best.''

This might be an ideal time for the Huskers to show up in Los Angeles. Safety
Taylor Mays, cornerback Cary Harris and middle linebacker Rey Maualuga make
their first college starts for USC, while safety Kevin Ellison and defensive end
Chris Barrett make their second and nose guard Fili Moala his third.

``I hope they just do what they are capable of doing, and we don't want them to
do more than asked,'' Carroll said. ``But we're pretty confident in what they
can do. They practiced a lot this week and got plenty of opportunities. I always
look at challenges as opportunities.''

All those top-ranked recruiting classes Carroll has compiled should alleviate
some of those concerns.

``I hope again we can show that we do have the depth and we do have the
competition on this team that can withstand these types of issues,'' Carroll
said. ``It isn't like we haven't had them over the years. We've dealt with this
before.''

More data on DNA may be OK ;
 If the Legislature approves, state will move to forefront of identifying
criminals through science.

In April 1993, a 30-year-old Roswell woman was awakened by a knife- wielding
intruder who blindfolded and raped her before fleeing her apartment.

Police had no leads until last year, when the GBI's Crime Lab began comparing
biological evidence collected from the scenes of unsolved rapes with samples of
DNA taken from convicted sex offenders.

They matched the Roswell crime evidence with the DNA of John Scieszka, a former
welder serving a life term for raping five University of Georgia women in 1995
and 1996. Last June, Scieszka pleaded guilty to the Roswell attack.

Now the state is poised to expand its 8-year-old DNA program from collecting
about 1,000 samples a year from sex offenders to nearly 40,000 from all felons.
If legislation backed by Lt. Gov. Mark Taylor passes as expected, Georgia will
move to the forefront of the national movement to expand state DNA databases and
link them together.

Taylor predicts Georgia's new system will "provide the proof to solve literally
hundreds of unsolved crimes," deter future crimes and exonerate innocent
prisoners who were wrongly convicted.

Atlanta defense attorney Jack Martin said he believes it's "just a matter of
time" before DNA evidence frees a Georgia death row inmate.

"This is one of the great revolutions in solving crimes, for both sides," said
Martin, legislative advisor for the Georgia Association of Criminal Defense
Lawyers. "It helps find criminals, but it's an opportunity to exonerate people
who in the past would have been convicted on what we thought was reliable
evidence."

This week, state lawmakers were trying to agree on how much to compensate a
Clayton County man convicted of rape after DNA evi-

dence showed he didn't commit the crime. Calvin Johnson was freed in June after
16 years in prison.

Georgia's DNA database has produced relatively few spectacular prosecutions or
exonerations. Usually, its benefits are far less dramatic.

"Mostly we link one unsolved crime to another," said George Herrin, director of
the GBI's Crime Lab. "We get one or two of those a month.

"But Florida, where they've been doing a lot more samples than us for three or
four years, has a rate of association 10 to 12 times ours," Herrin said. " I
think (Taylor's bill) will help solve a lot of crimes."

Georgia is the latest state to look at increased collection of DNA as a law
enforcement --- and criminal defense --- tool. Several states also have
increased the numbers of crimes eligible for testing.

DNA samples can be obtained from blood, saliva, hair, skin or semen. The GBI
currently collects blood samples from sex criminals and keeps them in
refrigerated storage at its headquarters east of Atlanta. Evidence experts
catalog the DNA characteristics of each sample and store the information on
computer files.

Taylor's bill would expand that program so anyone convicted of a felony after
July 1, 2000, would be tested. And felons already in prison would be tested upon
release, if not sooner. The state expects to pay about $ 35 per sample,
excluding personnel costs. The total tab would be about about $ 2.2 million a
year.

Critics believe such testing threatens constitutional privacy protections.

Debbie Seagraves, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of
Georgia, argued that the DNA database will be too large, and too vulnerable to
outsiders, such as insurance companies snooping for genetic health tendencies.

"Any time you compile large databases, that information can never be entirely
secure, either due to carelessness or greed," Seagraves said. "You don't even
need DNA in non-violent crimes, or in most violent crimes."

Herrin said rape is the crime most likely to yield useful DNA evidence. But even
in rapes, he said, semen of the attacker is not present about 30 percent of the
time.

Many other violent crimes don't provide DNA evidence either. "If you have a
drive-by shooting, it's extremely unlikely," Herrin said.

But when DNA evidence is available, it often raises questions about the
reliability of other forms of evidence, Martin said.

That's why Martin helped convince legislators to allow defendants, prisoners and
their lawyers to have carefully controlled access to the DNA database as a means
to try to establish their innocence.

Martin said uncontaminated DNA samples from crime scenes, when properly handled,
are extremely reliable evidence. "In fact, it's brought home how unreliable
eyewitnesses and confidential informants and circumstantial evidence are," he
said.

Herrin said police often arrest suspects and later determine their DNA does not
match crime scene evidence. Although such mismatches occur 20-30 percent of the
time during the GBI's DNA testing, Herrin said, failure to match doesn't prove
conclusively that the suspect is innocent.

But it does strongly suggest innocence, Martin said. "That's scary, because
those are cases that probably would have been prosecuted (if not for DNA
testing), and the eyewitnesses were flat wrong."

WVU FOOTBALL;
Cowboys could provide blueprint vs. Texas

BYLINE: Dave Hickman, Staff writer

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. P4B

LENGTH: 394 words


AUSTIN, Texas - If West Virginia's offense needs a primer on how to attack the
Texas defense tonight, well, the Mountaineers have it right there in front of
them, as fresh as can be.

The Dana Holgorsen offense that is all the rage now after a month of cutting
though opponents is still pretty much in place at his last coaching stop,
Oklahoma State, too. And a week ago the Cowboys rolled up 576 yards and 36
points against the Longhorns.

"We have,'' Holgorsen said, "a whole game of watching how they defended it.''

Of course, that can work a lot of different ways. Yes, West Virginia has a
blueprint for all the things that worked well against Texas last week, but the
Longhorns are also practicing for the second straight week against the same
offense. That has to help.

And the truth is, despite numbers that on the surface would indicate otherwise,
Texas pretty much handled the Oklahoma State offense. Yes, the Cowboys gained
those 576 yards, but OSU was averaging 687 in three other games. And sure, the
Cowboys scored 36 points, but they were averaging 62.

Most significantly, Oklahoma State lost the game. Granted, it came on what was
probably a phantom touchdown when Texas tailback Joe Bergeron fumbled as he
crossed the goal line with 29 seconds to play, but the bottom line is that Texas
found a way to curtail the OSU offense somewhat and win the game.

That will be the goal tonight, too, when No. 8 West Virginia faces No. 11 Texas
- just curtail the West Virginia offense and win the game. Texas hopes to repeat
the feat from last week.

"You have to make great offenses earn everything they do. Oklahoma State has a
great offense. They're not a good offense, they're a great offense,'' Texas
defensive coordinator Manny Diaz said. "But the first eight times they had the
ball they only scored two touchdowns. Touchdowns are what win and lose football
games.''

Indeed, Oklahoma State moved the ball, but from the 2-minute mark of the first
quarter until just 19 seconds remained in the third, the Cowboys got just two
field goals. If Texas can hold West Virginia to nothing but field goals for more
than half the game, much of the battle will have been won.

BERRY HOPES TO REINVIGORATE MIAMI OFFENSE

BYLINE: By JORGE MILIAN Palm Beach Post Staff Writer

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 11B

LENGTH: 622 words

DATELINE: BOISE, IDAHO


University of Miami coach Larry Coker said there will be "some differences" in
the Hurricanes offense with Todd Berry calling the plays today against Nevada.

Maybe one of those differences will be that UM will score some touchdowns.

Through the 12-game regular season, the Hurricanes registered 234 points. The
last time UM scored fewer points in the regular season was in 1979 when Howard
Schnellenberger's first Miami team was limited to 191 points in 11 games.

UM is ranked 88th nationally in total offense (314.6 yards per game) and scoring
offense (19.5 ppg.). The Hurricanes have managed to score 30 points in a game
twice -- against Division I-AA opponent Florida A&M (51) and against winless
Florida International (35).

Berry, 46, is serving as interim offensive coordinator after Rich Olson resigned
two weeks ago to join Dennis Erickson's staff at Arizona State.

Berry has served as an offensive coordinator at Tennessee-Martin (1986-88),
Southeast Missouri State (1991), East Carolina (1992-95) and Louisiana-Monroe
(2004-05). He was also the head coach at Army (2000-03) and Illinois State
(1996-99).

Coker said UM's offensive approach today won't be radically different, "but we'd
like to give our players an opportunity to showcase themselves and we'd like to
be aggressive. Hopefully we talk after the game on Sunday and you'll say, 'Wow,
I like that.' But it comes down to making plays."

No matter how many plays UM makes today, Berry doesn't expect to return next
season. He has spoken to Mario Cristobal about becoming FIU's offensive
coordinator but has made no decision.

"It's an Oklahoma cliche, 'It's not my first rodeo,' " Berry said of his job
situation. "It's not what we'd like to have happen, but I recognize it's the
profession, part of it. I know what I've got to do to help coach Coker and this
team win. After that, I've got to work on getting a job."

In bed early: After allowing his players to stay up as late as 1 a.m. this week,
Coker installed a 10:30 p.m. curfew Saturday night.

"They're usually in bed by 10:30 anyway," Coker joked.

Nevada's players have been under a 10:30 p.m. curfew since they arrived
Wednesday.

Philosophical similarities;
ND, Purdue offenses mirror each other

BYLINE: By JASON KELLY; Tribune Staff Writer

SECTION: ; Pg. W2; 2002 GAMEDAY: ND NOTEBOOK

LENGTH: 874 words


SOUTH BEND -- Bill Diedrick, the designer of Notre Dame's streamlined offense,
and Joe Tiller, the Purdue coach who has blown the clouds of dust from Ross-Ade
Stadium, have sold any reluctant Midwesterners on their wide-open western
philosophy.

Tiller pumped air into a Purdue program that had gone flat five years ago, while
Diedrick handed the keys to a quarterback previously perceived as ill-equipped
to handle a passing offense.

By any measure, Tiller's tenure to date has to be considered a success. Purdue
has won 40 games since he arrived in 1997 after winning only 33 in the previous
10 years.

Notre Dame's 22-0 win over Maryland last week provided more proof that a West
Coast offense need not be bound by geography.

Tiller and Diedrick have known each other for many years and worked together in
1989 and 1990 at Washington State.

They will be on opposite sides today when Diedrick coordinates an Irish offense
that will bear a striking resemblance to Tiller's.

Or is it Tiller's offense that resembles Diedrick's?

Both coaches' current biographies list them as offensive coordinator at
Washington State in 1989 and 1990, with Tiller also serving as assistant head
coach and offensive line coach, and Diedrick also coaching the quarterbacks.

A Washington State sports information department employee said Friday that its
1989 and 1990 media guides refer to Tiller as the assistant head coach and
offensive coordinator, with Diedrick as only the quarterbacks coach.

According to Notre Dame associate athletic director John Heisler, Diedrick said
Friday night that he and Tiller both served as offensive coordinator during
those seasons.

Reminiscing about their relationship earlier this week, Diedrick was asked if he
helped persuade Tiller, who spent several years earlier in his career as a
defensive assistant, about the merits of a pass-oriented offense.

"Yeah, I think so," Diedrick said. "And as a defensive coach, I think you know
things that kind of hurt you and kind of weaken a defensive team, things that
kind of give you problems."

Both Tiller and Diedrick hope to give the opposing defense problems today with a
system each knows well. That should make for an interesting chess game within
the game as two coaches with similar offensive philosophies attempt to dissect
defenses with a good feel for the schemes.

Diedrick won't get too deep into the details of what he might do, but he knows
Tiller will put up a fight to stop it.

"I think we're similar a little bit in that we kind of like to throw the ball. I
think Joe as a person, you know, he's from the old school. He likes to get after
it a little bit," Diedrick said, adding with a laugh, "I think that's probably
all I can really say on game week."

The next big game

 When Tyrone Willingham coached at Stanford, the entire season served as a
prelude to "The Big Game," the annual season-finale against California.

As Willingham is discovering in his first season at Notre Dame, almost every
Irish game falls into that category.

Notre Dame and Purdue have played 73 times since 1896, a long-standing tradition
that transcends its non-conference, early-season status to a level that only the
most intense rivalries reach. Like Stanford-Cal.

"I think it resembles all of those rivalries of that nature. It probably has
aspects of Michigan-Michigan State, North Carolina-North Carolina State,"
Willingham said. "When you have a program the likes of Notre Dame, that as a
tradition and a history, it's a program that everyone is shooting for. So
therefore, every week it's someone else's big game. It's their 'make-my-season'
game. So yes, you have those aspects every week at this institution."

Learning vicariously

 Notre Dame back-up quarterback Pat Dillingham played only the final series last
Saturday against Maryland, long after the game had been decided.

He did not throw a pass in 10 plays, running the final 5:51 off the clock to
complete the 22-0 Irish win.

As Holiday's primary back-up, Irish coaches want him to have meaningful
experience before an emergency makes him the starter.

Game situations seldom offer an ideal opportunity to do that, though, and
fast-paced Notre Dame practice sessions force Dillingham, and current
third-string quarterback Chris Olsen, to learn almost by osmosis.

"What really makes it difficult in our situation is the nature of our practices.
With the style of practice that we have, you get so few reps, so therefore the
No. 1 guy basically has to take all the reps. It's more like a pro practice,"
Willingham said. "So therefore, your No. 2 guy has to be great mentally. He has
to be a guy that really handles learning vicariously, and if he can do that,
then we're in great shape."

A new voice

 Bernie Kish, the executive director of the College Football Hall of Fame,
replaces longtime host Bob Lux today on WSBT AM-960's Notre Dame pregame
broadcast from the Varsity Clubs hotel.

Kish's guests from 7:30-10:30 a.m. today will include past Purdue players Leroy
Keyes and South Bend's Ed Ehlers. Former Notre Dame player Jim Seymour and coach
Ara Parseghian, among other past Irish notables, also will participate.

Steelers' offense putting on show

BYLINE: John Perrotto

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 6B

LENGTH: 403 words


PITTSBURGH The Steelers' offense, over the past six weeks, has put on a show
unlike that of any other team in franchise history.

Nobody is enjoying watching the offense pile up the points more than the
Pittsburgh defense. It has the best seat in the house for the high scoring
attack that frees the defense to get after opponents as they try to play catch
up.

"We have an offense that does a great, great job," safety Will Allen said. "It's
hard to stop those guys."

The Steelers scored 24 straight points Sunday in their rally to a 34 27 victory
over the Broncos, who lead the NFL in points allowed and total yards allowed.

The win enabled the Steelers (9 5) to control their fate when it comes to making
the playoffs; they will qualify for the postseason by winning their last two
games at Baltimore (4 10) Sunday and at Cleveland (3 11) on Jan. 3.

The Steelers could also clinch a berth Sunday if they win and the New York Jets
(9 5) lose at home to the AFC East champion New England Patriots (12 2).

While the six time Super Bowl winning franchise has built much of its history on
the foundation of strong defense, it is Pittsburgh's offense that is leading the
charge now. The Steelers have scored at least 30 points in a team record six
straight games, going 5 1 in that span to help overcome a 4 4 first half of the
schedule.

"Our offense is unstoppable," defensive end Cam Heyward said. "To have an
offense that can go up and down with anybody, it doesn't matter who's out there.
It's pretty special."

The offense helps take pressure off a defense that has had its ups and downs.
Pittsburgh is fifth in the NFL in rushing defense with 89.4 yards allowed a
game, but 31st against the pass, giving up an average of 279.1 yards.

"You really don't see themselves rest on their laurels or patting themselves on
the back," Heyward said of the offense. "They're trying to continue to score.
You appreciate that as a defense because they give some leeway at times."

The Steelers seemingly should be able to keep putting up big numbers against the
injury ravaged Ravens and woeful Browns.

Antonio Brown has 64 catches for 868 yards in the past six games, leading the
league in both categories in that span, while quarterback Ben Roethlisberger has
averaged 365.8 yards and thrown 13 touchdown passes.

The Steelers are also healthy. Everyone practiced fully Friday, and no one was
listed as doubtful or questionable on the injury report.

4-year sentence for driver who killed Sealy

BYLINE: From our news services

SOURCE: CONSTITUTION

SECTION: Sports; Pg. 4F

LENGTH: 265 words

The driver who killed Minnesota Timberwolves swingman Malik Sealy in a wrong-way
car crash was sentenced Wednesday in Minneapolis to four years in prison.

Souksangouane Phengsene, 44, was legally drunk when his pickup truck smashed
head-on into Sealy's sport-utility vehicle on May 20. Authorities said
Phengsene, who pleaded guilty to criminal vehicular homicide, had a
blood-alcohol level of 0.19.

Defense attorneys asked for no prison time for Phengsene, arguing that he was
remorseful and that the accident occurred near a construction zone. He will have
to serve at least 32 months.

Van Horn breaks leg

New Jersey Nets forward Keith Van Horn broke his left leg in Tuesday night's
99-94 loss to the Orlando Magic and will be out four to six weeks. The
fourth-year forward was going after a rebound with Orlando's Don Reid and Bo
Outlaw in the second quarter when he landed awkwardly and broke his left fibula.


Bryant sells stake

Los Angeles Lakers guard Kobe Bryant has dropped out as an owner of the Olimpia
Milano basketball team, only 10 months after he and his father had purchased a
50 percent stake in the team.

The board of directors of the team cleared the way over the weekend for a group
of Milan businessmen to take over financial control.

Briefly . . .

The Detroit Pistons waived forward Ansu Sesay, a day after he was acquired,
along with guard Dana Barros, from the Dallas Mavericks for forward Loy Vaught.

Chicago Bulls guard Corey Benjamin was charged with domestic battery after his
live-in girlfriend accused him of slapping her.

Calling it "one of the most serious cases this committee has considered in
recent years," the NCAA placed the men's basketball program at California on
three years probation Thursday.

The Bears were banned from postseason play next season, had two scholarships cut
for the 1998-99 and 1999-2000 seasons and must forfeit 28 victories in the
1994-95 and 1995-96 seasons.

The penalties were based on former coach Todd Bozeman's payments of $ 30,000 in
1994-96 to the parents of former point guard Jelani Gardner, now with
Pepperdine.

SPORTS AND THE LAW

Marv Albert must give impressions of his teeth to a Virginia crime laboratory

forcing her to perform oral sex. . . . Thomas K. Welch, president and chief
executive officer of the Salt Lake Olympic Organizing Committee, is being
investigated for allegedly assaulting his wife last week, according to a Salt
Lake City police report.

TENNIS

Boris Becker dropped out of the Mercedes Cup in Stuttgart, Germany, with a leg
injury, which he traced back to his Wimbledon quarterfinal loss to Pete Sampras.
French Open champion Gustavo Kuerten also withdrew, citing pain in his ribs
while trailing Felix Mantilla in a third-round match. . . . Doug Flach of
Atlanta, who upset Andre Agassi a night earlier, lost to Rainer Schuttler 4-6,

and co-founder of the Nantahala Outdoor Center near Bryson City, N.C., has been
elected to the Emory University Sports Hall of Fame. A member of the class of
1959, Payson lettered on the swim team. He was elected, however, for his
contributions to amateur sports since graduation, as a whitewater canoer,
bicycle racer and tri-athlete. The Nantahala Outdoor Center is one of the
nation's best known whitewater canoe and kayak training centers. . . . The

Broncos' defense now the show

BYLINE: Bill Williamson

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. J-03

LENGTH: 610 words


Al Wilson realizes there is a lack of appreciation for dominance on his side of
the football.

Even in Wilson's family, there is a lack of understanding about the importance a
defense can have on a football team.

"My own mama doesn't even care about defense," the Broncos' standout middle
linebacker said. "I play defense, and she doesn't even care about defense. She
doesn't want to hear about the importance of making a stop on third down or any
of that stuff. All she wants to see is the referee raise his hands for a
touchdown.

"Offense sells tickets. Nobody wants to see defenses win games, but defense does
win championships. All people want to see is offense, but you can't win without
defense."

If the first quarter of the season in Denver has been any indication, Wilson
couldn't speak truer words.

Defense is winning games in Denver. However, there are grumblings.

Even with a 3-1 record - the one game Denver lost was by a point, 7-6 at
Jacksonville - there is a concern among fans that this team is struggling and is
not as good as its record, which projects to a lofty 12-4 season.

Why is there trepidation about the Broncos' start?

It is because the offense hasn't clicked. Typical Denver offensive staples such
as the running game and production in the red zone and on third down have been
suspect.

Folks are nervous the Broncos are not going to be any good this season because
the offense is struggling.

But really, it's OK if the defense is the flag carrier. Sure, in Denver, fans
are used to the offense being the show and the defense doing just enough to help
win.

But the roles have reversed this season. The Broncos are winning with great,
fundamental defense and an offense that is providing enough spark when needed.

"Everyone wants a great defense, but when you get it everyone is worried about
the offense," Denver defensive tackle Luther Elliss said. "It seems people don't
think teams can win because of defense."

Recent history has proved that winning football in the NFL means winning with
defense first. Super Bowls aren't won by teams that average 30 points a game
anymore. It doesn't happen.

The past four Super Bowl winners - New England (which has won two of the past
three) Tampa Bay and Baltimore - all were led by defense.

The Ravens and Buccaneers didn't have high-powered offenses, but they won. Their
typical games were reminiscent of the past three Broncos games. After losing to
Jacksonville, Denver defeated San Diego 23-13 and Tampa Bay 16-13. Not
overpowering offensive performances, but because of power defense, the offensive
output was enough.

"Defensive-minded teams usually win tight games," Denver defensive end Marco
Coleman said. "Nobody gets excited about 6-3 games, but they should get excited
by victories. Winning a boring game is better than losing an exciting game."

In today's NFL - where parity created by the salary cap places a heavy hand on
the product - two-sided dynasties don't exist. Teams that dominate on both sides
of the ball are nowhere to be found. Every team has some type of weakness.

Through a quarter of the season, there are no teams that rank in the top 10 in
overall offense and defense. Minnesota is ranked No. 1 on offense and No. 29 on
defense. Indianapolis is No. 2 on offense and dead last (No. 32) on defense.
Seattle is No. 1 on defense and No. 16 on offense. Denver is No. 2 on defense
and No. 14 on offense.

In the NFL, you just can't have both anymore.

If a team is succeeding on defense, enjoy it. It means a lot of games are going
to be won.

"I just wish my mama loved defense likes she does offense," Wilson said.

 RAMS 45, FALCONS 29;
 MATT WINKELJOHN'S GAME REPORT

BYLINE: Matt Winkeljohn, Staff

SOURCE: CONSTITUTION

SECTION: Sports; Pg. 8C

LENGTH: 492 words

A candid look at why the Falcons lost Sunday at St. Louis.
1 The Rams' offense is too good. The Falcons' offense was more opportunistic
than it has been all season, converting all three red-zone possesions into
touchdowns. It didn't matter. St. Louis racked up 529 yards total offense and
had drives of 95, 97, 75, 59, 52 and 79 yards, all but one resulting in a
touchdown.


2 The Rams are better counterpunchers. The Falcons appeared to gain a big
advantage when Darrick Vaughn returned the opening kickoff 96 yards for a
touchdown, but the Rams countered with a 103-yard return by Tony Horne. The Rams
converted their one takeaway into a 97-yard TD drive while the Falcons failed to
turn their takaway into any points.


3 The Falcons couldn't stop Faulk.  Marshall Faulk, the Rams running back who
leads the NFL in yards from scrimmage with 1,083, rushed for a career- best and
NFL season-best 208 yards on 25 carries. He added seven receptions for 78 yards.


WHAT WENT RIGHT
Despite the loss, there were some positives for the Falcons.
1 The Falcons offense showed some life. After failing to score an offense
touchdown in each of the past two games, the Falcons scored three. An offense
ranked next-to-last in the NFL with an average of 255 yards per game, had 158 in
the first two quarters, but just 259 overall --- against a defense ranked
next-to-last in the NFL.


2 Jamal Anderson looked more like himself. The Falcons running back looked more
like his old self than all season. He was running over defenders, making cuts,
running with authority on the way to 14 carries for 64 yards (4.6-yard average)
and a touchdown. He also caught four passes for 67 yards.

BACK TO THE BOARD
The Falcons' priority list in practice this week is dominated by a need to focus
on the little things.
1 They need more points. Other than the Falcons' three scoring drives, their
possessions went for 9, 36 (and an interception at the 3-yard line), 8, 3, 11, 9
and 40 yards (to end the game). That won't get it done, especially against an
offense like the Rams'.


2 Avoid the special-teams breakdowns. Vaughn has returned two kickoffs for
touchdowns (including one for 100 yards at Denver), and Dwight returned a punt
70 yards for a score at Philadelphia. But they've given up two kickoff returns
for scores, and several other long returns.


3 Make more tackles. That goes for kickoffs, and defense. ''I don't think we've
ever played a game where we missed more tackles,'' said defensive coordinator
Rich Brooks.

THE OUTLOOK
How things look for the rest of the season.
Falcons: Anybody planning on watching the Falcons lay an egg Sunday was
surprised. But this team still needs more consistent offense to turn it around.

Rams: Their defense is porous, although the overall statistics from Sunday don't
bear that out. But with this offense, does it matter? If they stay healthy,
who's going to beat them?

Report: Alabama to name Brian Daboll as its next offensive coordinator

BYLINE: Tony Tsoukalas, The Anniston Star, Ala.

SECTION: SPORTS

LENGTH: 355 words


Feb. 18--TUSCALOOSA -- It appears Alabama has found its next offensive
coordinator, as New England Patriots tight ends coach Brian Daboll is expected
to be named to the position, according to a report from ESPN.

Daboll has been on New England's coaching staff since 2013 and has been serving
as a tight ends coach since 2014. Before joining the Patriots, he served as an
offensive coordinator for three NFL teams: the Kansas City Chiefs (2012), Miami
Dolphins (2011) and Cleveland Browns (2009-10). Daboll has also served as the
quarterbacks coach for the New York Jets (2007-08) and had an earlier stint with
the Patriots where he was a wide receivers coach (2002-2006) as well as a
defensive coaching assistant (2000-01).

Although new to the Crimson Tide's coaching staff, Daboll has worked with
Alabama head coach Nick Saban in the past, serving as a graduate assistant under
Saban at Michigan State in 1998-99.

Daboll has had his ups and downs during his time as an offensive coordinator in
the past. In his two years at Cleveland, Daboll's offense ranked 32nd in 2009
and 29th in 2010 in terms of total offense. However, during his one season at
Miami he improved a Dolphins offense that ranked 30th in terms of scoring the
year before to 20th under his guidance. In 2012, Daboll's Chiefs offense ranked
ninth in total offense but finished last in the league in scoring, averaging
just 13.2 points per game.

Daboll will replace Steve Sarkisian, who accepted the offensive coordinator
position with the Atlanta Falcons earlier this month. Sarkisian was named the
offensive coordinator in waiting in December after former offensive coordinator
Lane Kiffin took the head coaching job at Florida Atlantic.

Sarkisian later took over full play-calling duties a week before Alabama's
matchup against Clemson in the national championship game on Jan. 9. Under
Sarkisian, the Tide's offense gained 376 yards in a 35-31 defeat to the Tigers.

NFL Sunday game of the week: Green Bay Packers vs. Philadelphia Eagles;
Two NFC powers with potent offenses face off Sunday as the Green Bay Packers
welcome the Philadelphia Eagles to chilly Lambeau Field at 4:25 p.m. Eastern
Time.

BYLINE: Jacob Gofman Contributor

SECTION: USA

LENGTH: 531 words


The stakes grow higher each week as the NFL season marches along toward December
and the playoffs. In Week 11, four of the NFC's best, the Arizona Cardinals
(8-1), Detroit Lions (7-2), Green Bay Packers (6-3), and Philadelphia Eagles
(7-2) face off in games that will help define the NFC playoff picture. The
latter game, which pits the NFC East-leading Eagles against the Packers - who
sit on the outside of the playoffs looking in - is the premier match-up of the
week.

The Packers enter Week 11 coming off a dominant prime-time victory against the
Bears in which quarterback Aaron Rodgers threw six touchdowns in the first half.
Since Rodgers told the media to relax, the Packers have been one of the league's
best teams, with five wins in their last six games. In that span, Rodgers has
been nearly perfect, throwing for 21 touchdowns and only two interceptions. Wide
receiver Jordy Nelson heaped praise on Rodgers, telling reporters at NFL.com
that he had never seen the quarterback play better.

"I mean, if you look at last week with what we were able to do in the first
half, I don't think he can play better. It's still hard, I think, over a course
of a season to match what we did a few years ago when we went 15-1 and our
offense was putting up unbelievable numbers."

The offense and its efficiency has been the primary driver of the team's success
over the last six games. The team has averaged 37.1 points per game over their
current stretch and has done most of their damage early, scoring 10 points on
average in the first quarter and 15 over their last three games. While the
offense is ranked only 10th in passing and 18th in rushing, their efficiency
comes from not turning the ball over and scoring when it is important, early and
often.

The Eagles have yet to play a stretch of games with the kind of offensive
consistency they displayed last year, but few are complaining as they sit atop
the NFC East with seven wins. Two weeks ago, there was considerable uncertainty
as an injury to quarterback Nick Foles put the offense in the hands of Mark
Sanchez. Sanchez, however, has been effective thus far, throwing for 534 yards
and four touchdowns in his first two games. As the Sanchez experience continues,
fans and pundits will be watching closely to see if Sanchez is really playing at
a high level or whether Chip Kelly's offense has enabled the quarterback to
succeed.

The differentiating factor for the Eagles this season has been their ability to
score on defense and special teams. The team has four defensive touchdowns and
three return touchdowns this season, which has helped them through stretches
when the offense was under performing. Football Outsiders measure the Eagles as
both the most fortunate and the best special teams in the league. The team has
seen more sub-par play from opposing special teams than any team in the league,
but they have also been able to capitalize on it.

In a close game, a weird play or two that falls in favor of the Eagles might be
enough to get their eighth win, but keeping pace with Aaron Rodgers might be too
much to ask of Mark Sanchez. As long as the offense continues to roll, expect
the Packers to hold an edge in this game.

LAKERS NOTES;
Triangle offense back in Lakers' playbook

BYLINE: By AL BALDERAS, The Orange County Register

SECTION: SPORTS

LENGTH: 516 words

DATELINE: EL SEGUNDO


The triangle offense was thought to have faded from the Lakers' playbook about
as quickly as it took former coach Phil Jackson to clean out his office.

One has returned -- and it isn't Jackson.

The offense, which became a household name during the Chicago Bulls' six NBA
championships, resurfaced briefly during the Lakers' 111-104 victory over the
Rockets on Friday. By the looks of things, it will be back.

``The coaching staff seems to really like it,'' Kobe Bryant said. ``We like it
as players. We worked on it extensively (Sunday at practice), and I think you'll
see it a lot more.''

The Lakers used a similar offense when Jackson coached the team, and Bryant said
his reputation for not liking the triangle was unfounded. Bryant has been the
Lakers' top offensive threat throughout the season but has tried to get
teammates involved in the offense. The triangle will allow this to happen more.

``I love the offense,'' Bryant said. ``When he (Coach Rudy Tomjanovich) asked me
about it, I was all for it. Tex (Winter, the creator of the triangle offense)
and I have an incredible relationship. We're really close. He taught me how to
play in the triangle. He was my mentor. If people think I didn't like the
triangle, that's a misconception because I love the offense.''

MISSING MINNESOTA

Lakers forward Devean George hoped to be back in the lineup in time to play in
tonight's game at Minnesota, but he remained in Southern California.

George is still recovering from offseason surgery, but has continued to practice
with the team and is sure his return will be soon.

``I'll get more done here as opposed to going on the road trying to find a gym
(or) a health club,'' George said. ``All of our equipment, gym machines and
everything is here.''

George now would like to come back in time for the Lakers' Jan. 19 game vs.
Minnesota. Wanting to play against the Timberwolves is important to George
because he grew up and attended college in Minnesota. If he is not ready to play
in next week's contest, the Lakers and Timberwolves meet March 31.

``Before this month is over I should be out there, active, playing,'' he said.
``Right now I'm going through everything (at practice), full-court, half-court,
all the defensive drills.''

Bryant's priorities

Bryant wasn't surprised to hear that his No. 8 Lakers jersey fell to 72nd place
in sales among NBA players in December.

``Obviously we've been through a lot,'' Bryant said. ``I have a base of
supporters that stay with me through thick and through thin. It's not something
that I lose sleep over. I just go out there and work hard every day. Hopefully
one day things will turn back around.''

Keeping his attention on the this season's rebuilding has given Bryant a chance
to put his past behind him.

``I just appreciate people's support as a whole,'' he said. ``I just feel
blessed to be able to play the game.

``I'm not going to sit here and say, `I want my jersey sales to be No. 1. I want
to sell this many and this many.'

``I'm just blessed to be on the court playing. So the fact that it's not No. 1
or No. 2 or whatever, it's not of utmost importance.''

Mizzou notes: Offense exceeding Odom's expectations

BYLINE:  By Dave Matter St. Louis Post-Dispatch

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. B3

LENGTH: 600 words


COLUMBIA, Mo. - Leading up to the season, Missouri coach Barry Odom was
cautiously optimistic about his offense. With a new system in place, a rebuilt
offensive line and new playmakers at the skill positions, the Tigers would open
the year with far different pieces from the unit that ranked among the nation's
worst last year.

But how could Odom have envisioned this much progress this fast?

The Tigers (1-2, 0-1 Southeastern Conference) head into Saturday's visit from
Delaware State (0-2) ranked No. 5 in passing offense and No. 16 in total offense
with respective averages of 383.3 and 526.7 yards a game. During last year's 5-7
quagmire of a season, the Tigers ranked No. 113 in passing (165.5 yards per
game) and No. 125 in total offense (280.9).

Through three games, sophomore quarterback Drew Lock leads the SEC in passing
and ranks fourth nationally with 368.7 yards per game with an SEC-best nine
touchdown passes. The only quarterbacks throwing for more yards come from the
pass-heavy Air Raid spread systems at Texas Tech, California and Washington
State.

Odom hoped the addition of offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach Josh
Heupel would transform his offense but kept his expectations under control.

"I had some hesitation getting excited about it because I wanted to see it," he
said. "But I thought we had a shot at doing some of the things we're doing. I
needed to see it with the lights on. I needed to see it in real life in
competitive environments. I hope we continue to progress because there's still a
lot out there that side can do."

It's just three games, but Lock has more than doubled his 2015 touchdown total
(four) and increased his passer efficiency rating 58 points to 148.1.

He wasn't aware that he led the league in passing until someone alerted him
Monday. He wasn't necessarily surprised.

"I knew I had the skill set to do it," he said. "I just had to apply myself
more. I knew I had the guys around me to make plays and get to that level of
competing. I'm excited about it. That's pretty cool. Hopefully we can keep it
going through the season."

HILTON MAKES IMPACT

Backup safety and converted slot receiver Cam Hilton saw his most extensive
playing time of the season Saturday in MU's substitution packages. MU unveiled a
nickel package with Thomas Wilson moving from free safety to nickel and Hilton
taking over at free safety to replace a linebacker. In the dime package, the
Tigers played with three corners, shifting cornerback Aarion Penton inside to
cover the slot, three safeties, Michael Scherer at linebacker and four down
linemen. Hilton intercepted a pass in the third quarter and deflected a
third-down pass during Georgia's game-winning touchdown drive.

"His athletic ability is different than some in a good way," Odom said. The
former Webster Groves standout needs "to slow down some, if that makes sense,
and have his eyes in the right spot. He's so quick he sometimes gets out of
position because he's not trusting exactly what he's seeing. That comes with
reps and experience. He's got a chance to be a really good player."

EVENING KICKOFF AT DEATH VALLEY

A night game at Louisiana State's Tiger Stadium is considered one of the most
raucous settings in college football. Mizzou gets its first taste of Death
Valley after dark next week. MU's first-ever game at LSU will be under the
lights, a 6:30 p.m. kickoff on Oct. 1. LSU coach Les Miles is 51-6 in home night
games. The game will air on SEC Network. Missouri hasn't played LSU since
joining the SEC in 2012. MU is 1-0 all-time against the Tigers, owning a 20-15
victory in the 1978 Liberty Bowl.

Offensive Coordinator Steps Down at Tennessee

SECTION: Sports; E02

LENGTH: 584 words


Randy Sanders resigned as Tennessee's offensive coordinator yesterday, two days
after the Volunteers lost their third straight game with another punchless
performance.

Sanders will remain on the staff through the season, keeping part of his job as
quarterbacks coach. Play-calling duties will be handled by Coach Phillip Fulmer,
Sanders and the rest of the offensive coaching staff.

Tennessee continued its offensive struggles in a 16-15 loss Saturday to South
Carolina. The Vols have lost three in a row for the first time under Fulmer.

"This isn't a response to criticism. This is a response to what I see on the
field," Sanders said.

Tennessee's offense is one of the worst in the country. The Vols average 16.1
points per game, which ranks 108th out of 117 Division I-A schools. They are
99th in total offense, 98th in rushing offense, 79th in passing offense and
101st in passing efficiency.

Fulmer said he was somewhat surprised by Sanders's decision.

"Randy, in an unselfish gesture, has asked to step aside at the end of the
season," Fulmer said.

The Vols (3-4) play at No. 8 Notre Dame this week and finish the season against
Memphis, Vanderbilt and Kentucky. Tennessee began the season ranked third, but
dropped out of the Associated Press top 25 this week.

"Randy has dedicated his adult life to this program," Fulmer said.

The 40-year-old Sanders has been on the Vols' staff for 16 years, starting as a
graduate assistant after he was a backup quarterback. This is his seventh season
as offensive coordinator. He was promoted to the job before the 1998 national
championship game to replace David Cutcliffe, who left to be head coach at
Mississippi.

*  BOBSLEDDING: Olympic champion Jill Bakken and Todd Hays, who was on the
silver medal-winning four-man team at the Salt Lake City Games in 2002, will
lead the U.S. team into the World Cup season.

Bakken, of Kirkland, Wash., will be joined by Erin Pac of Farmington, Conn.;
Amanda Moreley of Auburn, Wash.; Bethany Hart of North Grafton, Mass., and
Ingrid Marcum of Elmhurst, Ill.

Hays, of Del Rio, Tex., will be teamed with Steve Mesler of Buffalo; Pavle
Jovanovic of Toms River, N.J.; and Garrett Hines of Atlanta.

Also selected to the team was Mike Kohn of Chantilly, who helped driver Brian
Shimer to the four-man Olympic bronze in 2002.

*  COLLEGE BASKETBALL: Wake Forest freshman Kevin Swinton has been suspended for
four games for an unspecified violation of university rules, Coach Skip Prosser
said.

The games include two preseason exhibition games and the season opener against
Mississippi Valley State. He is scheduled to return before Wake Forest travels
to New York to play in the Coaches vs. Cancer Classic tournament, which also
will include Syracuse, Texas Tech and Florida, among others.

Swinton averaged 25 points and 12 rebounds to lead Dudley High School to a North
Carolina state title last season.

*  BASEBALL: The Houston Astros rewarded Manager Phil Garner for leading the
club to its first World Series by extending his contract by one season to 2007.

Garner has guided the Astros to a 137-99 record over 11/2 seasons. Houston won
its first playoff series last year and made the World Series this season before
getting swept by the Chicago White Sox. . . .

St. Louis Cardinals left-handed reliever Randy Flores had surgery to remove a
bone spur from his throwing elbow. He is expected to recover by the time the
Cardinals report for spring training in February.

Do you like Shanahan's offense or Reeves'?

BYLINE: By Adam Schefter, Denver Post Sports Writer

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. D-12

LENGTH: 637 words

The handcuffs have come off the Denver Broncos' offense, now free to do anything
it wants. The handcuffs magically have reappeared on the New York Giants'
offense, now shackled indefinitely.

While Broncos coach Mike Shanahan is directing the NFL's top-ranked offense in
Denver, Giants coach Dan Reeves is directing the NFL's 29th-ranked offense in
New York.

This is nothing new. Ever since their relationship ended in a messy divorce
after the 1991 season - Shanahan moving on to coach the San Francisco 49ers'
offense and Reeves remaining in power one more year in Denver - their offenses
also have gone in separate ways.

From 1992 until today, Shanahan's offenses never have ranked any lower than
third in the league. Reeves' offenses, meanwhile, have struggled. In 1993,
Reeves masterminded the Giants' top-ranked rushing attack. But since then, his
offensive rankings have dropped each season, to the point where they now are
ranked 29th in the league.

As the Broncos' offense and time both pass, it has become increasingly evident
why Pat Bowlen and quarterback John Elway preferred Shanahan over Reeves. It is
partly why wide receiver Mike Sherrard left the Giants in the off-season to sign
with the Broncos.

He wanted to play on a winning offense, not one in which he said yesterday plays
"Big Ten football," as the Giants' offense does.

"You really can't blame the Giants' offensive struggles on anyone else (but
Reeves) because he's there every meeting and coaching every position on the
offense," Sherrard said. "The one thing I don't think Dan or the Giants offense
does is make adjustments.

"Last year we had a lot of games at halftime that were close, or we were
winning, and we'd make no adjustments at halftime and we'd end up losing the
game. And you've got to make adjustments. Here we make adjustments.

"At halftime, if things aren't working, we're going to change our whole game
plan. We may make up new plays at halftime. We make up new plays in the middle
of the quarter. We just have the flexibility to do that. Dan is not going to do
that. His theory is, if the play doesn't work, it doesn't work because you guys
aren't executing it. It's not working because I didn't call the right play."

Asked if there was a difference in the confidence level between the Broncos'
offense and the Giants' offense, Sherrard said: "Oh yeah, definitely. Here we
have the potential to score 35, 40, maybe 50 points if things go well for us.
With Dan's offense we knew it was going to be close, no matter who we were
playing and what the situation was. In the fourth quarter we were hoping to be
close, and here we're looking to blow people out.

"I think it helps a lot. You want to have a positive outlook. You want to have
that confidence going into the game. You don't want to go into the game thinking
it's going to be close because we're going to let them hang around. You want
that killer instinct, that ability to go for the jugular. And we have that
here."

How effective has the Broncos' offense been this year? They have the NFL's
leading offense, leading rusher, leading receiver, not to mention the leading
record in the AFC. And by the end of the season, the Broncos believe they'll
still be leading the league in offense while the Giants still are ranked near
the bottom.

"It's just night and day difference between Mike and Dan," said Broncos tight
end Shannon Sharpe, who has played for both coaches. "This offense allows you so
many options. There aren't as many seven-step drops where there's a chance a
quarterback can get sacked. He doesn't have to hold the ball and wait for the
receiver to get downfield.

"With this offense, we feel like if we're clicking on half the cylinders, we can
move the ball up and down the field. I don't think we ever felt that in Dan's
offense."

Black seeks input from leaders on immigration effects on county

BYLINE: Gary Nelson, Crossville Chronicle, Tenn.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 1047 words


April 02--CROSSVILLE -- Diane Black, 6th District Congressman, held an
immigration roundtable discussion last week in Crossville in order to hear
concerns from a variety of area leaders in key areas of law enforcement,
education and business and report those to colleagues in Washington D.C.

"When the immigration issue came up I wanted to hear from you all and take my
info back with me so you will have a voice in Washington," Black said.

Black met with Cumberland County Mayor Kenneth Carey Jr.; Crossville Mayor J.H.
Graham III; Crossville Police Chief David Beaty; Cumberland County Sheriff Butch
Burgess; Casey Cox, investigator; Cumberland County Director of Schools Aarona
VanWinkle; Sarah Hazleton of the Crossville-Cumberland County Chamber of
Commerce; Kendra Howard from Roane State Community College; and Larry and Karen
Lane of Mountain Vegetable Packers.

Black asked how immigration and illegal alien residents affected the various
areas in the community.

"Our biggest problem is with traffic-related offenses, DUI's with repeat
offenses and drug-related offenses," said Cumberland County Sheriff's
Investigator Casey Cox.

Black asked about the drug-related offenses.

"It's mainly with selling," Cox said.

"Is ICE (U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement) involved?" Black asked.

"Yes, but there is a delay," Cox said.

Burgess said sometimes it takes up to three business days for them to find out
if the suspect is wanted for a violent crime or not or if they will come to pick
up the suspect.

"In the mean time we have to hold them. It's putting financial pressure on the
county," Burgess said.

Burgess said the drug activity in the area is increasing tremendously because
Cumberland County is in the middle of Knoxville, Nashville and Chattanooga, with
a large drug hub being Atlanta, GA.

"If we had some kind of a data base to access, it would help greatly. We don't
have anything right now because it's federal and there's no access," Burgess
said.

"You make a good point," Black said. "You could be dealing with some dangerous
people."

Beaty said, "If we could get ICE to respond within 30 minutes instead of a few
days and let us know if they're going to pick them up. It would help."

"If it's a serious crime, we have to keep them. We can't release them, but if
there was a data base we had access to, we could see what we're dealing with,"
Burgess said.

In the education area, Black heard some of the big issues affecting Cumberland
County.

"We have no idea knowing who's illegal and who's not because they don't have to
report it and we can't ask them. There's no funding available for what we need,"
said VanWinkle.

She said Cumberland County had roughly 120-126 students who needed help with an
ESL teacher in the school system.

"Right now we have four teachers for all of them and we get no funding to pay
for these," VanWinkle said. "The cost is roughly $50,000 for salary and benefits
for just one."

VanWinkle said it was unfair because the county doesn't have the personnel
required to handle the situation and the county doesn't have the funds.

"Most of those students speak little or no English and the county is being held
accountable for them to perform at the same level as all the other students.
It's very difficult. There's a gap between the Hispanic versus the regular
English-speaking students. Some of those students have only had a few months of
teaching," VanWinkle said.

VanWinkle also said those low scores bring the average of the county down and
the county is held accountable as a part of the requirements for the Race To The
Top funds it received.

"I'd like to get with you about this in the future so we can talk about this
more. These are very good points that haven't been brought up before," Black
said.

In business, Hazleton said many small businesses were concerned with the costs
of funding and accommodating the illegal aliens coming into the country and how
it was going to effect the taxes they would have to pay.

Black asked if businesses were using the H-2A program.

The H-2A guest worker program was passed in 1986 as part of the Immigration
Reform and Control Act and is one of the primary legal ways for employers to
hire seasonal agriculture workers.

Karen Lane said they did not use it because it was too expensive to use and
extremely complicated.

"They are not able to use it because of the many requirements of the program, it
would price them out of business," said Carey.

"I am hearing a lot of this same thing in all of these meetings," Black said.

Larry Lane said the immigrants who work for them are doing the jobs a lot of the
local people don't want to do and it is seasonal work.

"They are very hard workers and they come to work when they are needed," Lane
said.

Black said congress needed to look at the current system and look at border
patrol.

"I don't have the answers to those at this point," Black said.

She is planning a trip with a colleague to see how the border patrol works and
is hoping the government will come up with a plan for consistently securing the
borders.

Black said she appreciated everyone meeting with her and giving her feedback on
what was happening in her district.

Black said she was taking the information back with her to the government and
committees.

Graham said he appreciated Black gathering the input of the community.

"There are lots of issues and we don't have the manpower to put an officer on
every corner and patrol all of this," Graham said.

He also said he wished the government would consider stiffer penalties to
businesses that were using illegal immigrants intentionally.

Black said the country needed to develop and have a good worker/visa program.

VanWinkle said, "We need to figure out how to get the people in this country to
work the jobs that are here."

Black said they needed to cut unemployment benefits down from 99 weeks to 26
weeks the way it was before the federal government took it over.

"Nothing makes you want to go out and go to work more than being hungry and not
having a roof over your head," Black said.

Black thanked all who attended for their input and said she would share the
information with congress.

NATION IN BRIEF;
Infamous rapist beaten by mob

BYLINE: From our news services

SECTION: NATIONAL NEWS; Pg. 12A

LENGTH: 782 words


A man known as Southern California's "pillowcase rapist" two decades ago was in
critical condition Thursday in Gary, Ind., the victim of a mob beating after
allegedly trying to rape another woman, a television station reported. Reginald
Muldrew, 47, was severely beaten by the woman's neighbors last week after trying
to break into her home, KCBS-TV in Los Angeles reported Thursday.

Muldrew, who moved to Gary after his release from prison in California, has been
hospitalized since Aug. 5, when he was so badly beaten that police used
fingerprints to identify him, according to KCBS- TV. He remained in critical
condition Thursday, Methodist Hospital nursing supervisor Leigh Sparks told The
Associated Press.

DEATHS Kevorkian at suicide

Dr. Jack Kevorkian and an associate took the body of a Massachusetts woman to a
hospital in Pontiac, Mich. late Thursday, a spokesman said. Kevorkian and Dr.
Georges Reding took the body to Pontiac Osteopathic Hospital at 11:07 p.m., said
Dr. Mitchell Garfield, an emergency room physician. Kevorkian identified the
woman as Judith Curren, 42, of Massachusetts. Kevorkian did not give the woman's
hometown, Garfield said. It was the 35th suicide Kevorkian has acknowledged
attending since 1990 and the sixth since his most recent acquittal on assisted
suicide charges.

CRIME Deputy kills wife

A sheriff's deputy shot and killed his estranged wife, wounded her
brother-in-law and then paced the block in Newport News, Va.,for 30 minutes
screaming "Shoot me!" before killing himself. Gregory A. Lovell, a sheriff's
deputy for eight years, had been despondent over the failure of his marriage,
Sheriff Clay Hester said. He shot Linda Lovell four times and shot James Ayers,
her brother-in-law, in the leg as he tried to help her, police said. Ayers was
in stable condition at a hospital.

Soldier faces charges

A soldier at Fort Bragg who displayed Ku Klux Klan and Nazi posters in his
locker and admitted to investigators he had a Chinese machine gun faces a
court-martial on weapons charges. Spec. Anthony Russell Evans was charged with
three counts of violating federal firearms law and one count of possessing a
stolen pistol, Lt. Col. Pete Pierce said.

Fake victim sentenced

A man who for six years pretended to be dying of cancer - even shaving his head
and faking seizures - got 14 months in prison Thursday for conning money and
sympathy from his family, church and employer. Charles Barry, 51, also was
ordered to repay nearly $ 43,000 to his victims and to perform 200 hours of
community service. The former car salesman claimed to have kidney, lung and
prostate cancer. His former wife and three stepsons believed him, as did most of
fellow residents of Canterbury, a town of 1,700 in central New Hampshire.

COURTS Divorce settled

Rep. Enid Greene and ex-husband Joe Waldholtz have reached a divorce settlement
that gives Greene sole custody of their 1-year-old daughter. The agreement also
covers property issues and averts a trial that was to begin Tuesday in Salt Lake
City. Waldholtz, who wanted joint custody of their daughter, is "not happy with
how things have turned out, but he's satisfied that he got a fair shake," said
Greg Skordas, Waldholtz's lawyer. The couple were divorced in June, but the
judge left open the question of custody of their daughter, Elizabeth, and the
division of their common property.

Simpson shuns cameras

O.J. Simpson moved Thursday to keep cameras out of his civil trial in Santa
Monica, Calif., asking for the case to be tried in the courtroom, "not on the 5
o'clock news." Nearly a year after Simpson's acquittal on murder charges was
televised around the world, his lawyer filed a motion objecting to the news
media's request for video and audio coverage of the wrongful death trial, set
for Sept. 17. "The judiciary and this community already experienced firsthand
the saturation of information disseminated outside of the courtroom during the
criminal trial created by media coverage," attorney Robert Baker wrote. Baker
objected not only to video cameras but also to audio coverage and still
photography, saying that because jurors probably will not be sequestered, such
coverage could prejudice Simpson's right to a fair trial.

Case between states

New York and New Jersey disagreed over more than 160 years of history Thursday
in a unique Supreme Court trial to determine which state is the home of most of
Ellis Island. At the end of the first trial ever in the high court's building,
New Jersey attorneys argued that an 1834 bistate agreement proves its claim to
all but the original 2.7 acres of the historic immigrant entry point.

Tyson could face 63-year jail term

BYLINE: From LEONARD DOYLE in New York

SECTION: FOREIGN NEWS PAGE; Page 10

LENGTH: 343 words


THE FORMER world heavyweight boxing champion ''Iron Mike'' Tyson has cultivated
a bad boy image since his days as a Brooklyn street thug when he was jailed for
mugging women.

One of the world's wealthiest and best known athletes, he was on Monday indicted
by a special grand jury in Indianapolis, on a charge of raping an 18-year old
contestant at the Miss Black America pageant earlier this summer. If convicted
Tyson, 25, will face a maximum sentence of 63 years in jail.

The court case is not expected to begin until early next year. Before then as
the challenger and former champion, he fights Evander Holyfield at Caesar's
Palace in Las Vegas on 8 November. Tyson has been promised $ 15m (pounds 7.8m)
to Holyfield's $ 30m.

The product of a Brooklyn ghetto, Tyson was singularly ill equipped to handle
the celebrity status that went with becoming the youngest heavyweight champion
in history. He flaunted himself in the nightclubs and discos of Manhattan and
told his biographer Jose Torres how he liked to ''hurt women'' when he made love
to them. His first wife, the actress Robin Givens, divorced him in 1988,
claiming that he beat her.

Tyson was then sued for fondling a woman at a New York disco and a jury
convicted him of battery, while awarding the victim only $ 100.

''If you're the heavyweight champion, his mentor and trainer the late Cus
d'Amato regularly told him, ''the money and the women are going to be there''.

Through a spokesman, Tyson, who also faces two counts of criminal deviate
behaviour and one of unlawful confinement, said he was innocent of all charges.

The woman making the rape allegation told police that she was attacked in the
early hours of 19 July in Tyson's hotel room at the Canterbury Hotel. The
prosecutor in the case, Jeffrey Modisset, said that the boxer persuaded the
victim to go out with him. ''The victim was led to believe that the meeting with
Tyson was going to be platonic. When she refused his advances, Tyson forced
nonconsensual sexual relations with her,'' the prosecutor said.

Seahawks' luck set to run out;
NFL

BYLINE: Simon Milham

SECTION: SPORT; Pg. 67

LENGTH: 275 words


KANSAS CITY have won just once on the road this season and that was back in Week
Two but they should improve that record in Seattle tonight, writes Simon Milham.

The Chiefs have played some close games at Indianapolis, Houston and Oakland,
although they were tonked by Denver on their last road trip.

Although Seattle is one of the most hostile environments in the NFL, they would
make a big statement to their AFC West rivals if they can take down the Seahawks
and maintain their lead in the division.

The Seahawks are a fortunate 5-5 in the weakest division in the league and three
of their wins have come against their lowly NFC West rivals. The statistics
underline their weakness. They are 28th in total offence, 20th in passing
offence, 30th in rushing offence and 27th in scoring offence. The defensive
rankings aren't much better - 28th in total defence, 30th in passing defence and
21st in scoring defence.

Kansas City are ninth in total offence and boast the top-ranked rushing attack,
which should be enough to overcome the 13thranked Seattle run defence, who have
yet to be tested by an elite ground game. Buying Kansas City's win index could
pay.

Green Bay have a puncher's chance of upsetting Atlanta in the Georgia Dome, but
they don't have the balanced attack that the Falcons possess. The Packers'
running game has struggled all season and their secondary is dealing with
injuries, which is not ideal going up against a top quarterback such as Matt
Ryan. Buying Atlanta's performance has plenty of potential upside.

Mountaineers putting focus on their offense

BYLINE: Tony Dobies

LENGTH: 406 words


MORGANTOWN, W.Va. -- After starting the season with five-straight 30-point
games, West Virginia's offense hasn't reached that milestone since.

Coach Bill Stewart said teams are "getting the book" on West Virginia, which
plays at No. 4 Cincinnati Friday night at 8 on ESPN2.

Stewart said he asked for more from starting quarterback Jarrett Brown, whose
production has slipped since suffering a concussion against Marshall in the
team's sixth game.

At the time, Brown was completing nearly 69 percent of his passes, averaging 202
yards passing and had eight touchdowns to just five interceptions. Since then,
he has completed 58 percent and is averaging 50 yards less passing. He has two
touchdowns and three interceptions in his past three games.

"He needs to pick it up, and he knows it," Stewart said. "I told him that I
wanted him to be alive in the pocket and have fun. I want him to play like it's
sandlot football."

Stewart also said he would like to see better pass blocking and more precise
routes from his receivers.

"We all need to pick it up," Stewart said. "We need to coach better, play
better."

Starting wide receiver Alric Arnett said the offense had a team meeting prior to
Monday's practice.

"Some guys singled themselves out about not putting forth the effort they are
supposed to in practice," Arnett said. "We need to focus."

The talk must have helped, as Stewart said Monday's practice was "as good as
we've had all season."

The offense had a season-low 17 points against Louisville, the worst defense
statistically in the Big East heading into the game.

The Mountaineer offense had 57 snaps against the Cardinals. Stewart said if the
Mountaineers have so few snaps against Cincinnati "it will be a mess."

Arnett said the offense will have to avoid turnovers to keep West Virginia's
defense from being put in a tough situation against Cincinnati's top-five
offense. He added the team will have to keep control of the ball to limit the
amount of time the Bearcats have it on offense.

"We are going to try to pound away at these guys and put up as many points as
possible," Arnett said.

Helping in that mission is the expected return of starting running back Noel
Devine, who suffered a left-ankle sprain against Louisville but ran in Monday's
practice.

"This is the time," said Jock Sanders, who took over after Devine got hurt. "If
we want to win this game, this is the time we need to have everything clicking."

BILL WILLIAMSON'S BRONCOS MAILBAG Way too early to judge on either side of ball

broncosmailbag. A new installment is posted online each Friday.

Q: Has Denver turned into the latest version of Baltimore or Tampa Bay, with its
potent defense and struggling offense? Or is it too early to start judging the
offense?

Stephan Stopa, Los Angeles

A: Just as it is too early to judge the Broncos' offense as anemic, it is too
early to place Denver's defense among the best in the past decade. Sure, in the
preseason, the Broncos' offense was less than impressive; the defense was, for
the most part, impressive. But neither side has proved anything yet. Expect to
see something in between from what each unit has shown. The offense, which was
clicking late in the preseason, won't be horrible, and the defense won't be
among the all-

time best.

Q: I had a chance to watch Quentin Griffin every week at Oklahoma, and he was
awesome. Could he be the second coming of Barry Sanders? His game is in that
mold, and he looked good in his only start last year. What do you think?

Keith Howard, Waco, Texas

A: Griffin is going to succeed. He has played well every time he has been given
the chance, whether it has been this preseason, against Indianapolis last year
or in college. He is going to be a very good pro. But let's not get too crazy
about the Barry Sanders comparisons. Sure, like the Hall of Famer, Griffin is
small, and his style is similar to Sanders'. But it's Barry Sanders we're
talking about. Let Griffin have time to carve his own niche.

Q: After having the preseason to reflect, what is your take on the O-line? In
particular, how do you think the tackles will perform? Can converted tight end
Dwayne Carswell step in if Matt Lepsis or George Foster get injured?

Mark Lawton,

Beavercreek, Ohio

A: This unit has changed, especially at the tackles, where there is uncertainty.
Lepsis struggled in the preseason, and teams will challenge him. He is a fine
athlete and should adjust well, but expect some moments of vulnerability as he
adjusts. The same goes for Foster. He played more than any other lineman on the
team in the preseason because this is his first year playing in the NFL. Mike
Shanahan even refers to him as a rookie. Foster is a massive man with nice
skills. Expect the veterans on the line to help him. As far as Carswell, he's
going back to tight end.

Cornhuskers insist that Raider rout is forgotten;
Nebraska players say they're not out to avenge 60-point loss to Tech last year

BYLINE: Randy Riggs, AMERICAN-STATESMAN STAFF

SECTION: SPORTS EXTRA; Pg. F3

LENGTH: 647 words


LINCOLN, Neb. -- Seventy to 10? Sorry, doesn't ring a bell.

A year ago in Lubbock, the Nebraska Cornhuskers certainly got their bell rung.
Texas Tech's 60-point romp marked the worst loss in the Huskers' 114-year
football history.

But from the comments from Nebraska leading into today's rematch between the 4-0
teams, it's almost like 2004 calendar skipped from Oct. 8 to Oct. 10. Oct. 9th?
Never happened.

"Last year was last year," tailback Cory Ross said. "This is a brand new year.
We're a different team and they're a different team."

So the Cornhuskers, perhaps unlike their fans, insist memories of last year's
embarrassment won't serve as fuel today when the Red Raiders make their first
road trip and the Huskers play the last of their five straight home games to
open the season.

Said Coach Bill Callahan: "All I know is this: all the Knute Rockne pep talks go
out the window when that ball is kicked."

Apparently the message is getting through.

"When you get that revenge factor going, you get too wrapped up in that,"
defensive end Jay Moore said. "You're so focused on getting revenge and payback
that you forget what you're really out here doing."

That's their story and they're sticking to it.

It sounds remarkably similar to the comments by the Raiders. No doubt they would
like to see history repeat itself but are more interested in rejuvenating their
offense after being held to "only" 30 points in a 13-point victory over Kansas
in their Big 12 opener.

"You can pretty much throw out last year's game compared to this one," Coach
Mike Leach said. "I think they are better on defense and I'm not sure if we are
better on offense, but we're comparable."

Even with last week's result, the Raiders are putting up typical Leach numbers
in their spread offense. They continue to lead the nation in scoring (57.2
points per game) and pass offense (449.2 yards), and rank second in total
offense (585.2 yards).

The Cornhuskers, conversely, were living off their defense in the first three
games. Over that span, their offense had accounted for only three touchdowns
(compared to 27 for Tech) while their defense had scored four TDs.

But in Nebraska's 27-20 double-overtime victory over Iowa State last week,
Callahan's West Coast offense finally upheld its end.

The run game struggled -- 36 yards on 25 carries. But quarterback Zac Taylor
gave Tech's defense something to think about by completing 36 of 55 passes for
431 yards, obliterating the school record of 342 set last year by Joe Dailey.

"I think it's a good offense that's improving," was Leach's assessment of the
Huskers. "I like the scheme of it and the way they shift a lot of guys around."

In the 70-10 game that no one wants to talk about, Tech's defense forced seven
turnovers that gave its offense a short field on several of its scoring drives.
The Raiders' defense is being opportunistic again, doing their part in helping
Tech lead the Big 12 in turnover margin. Tech has recovered seven fumbles and
intercepted two passes.

"They're physical and opportunistic," Callahan said. "They play the ball every
day in practice."

Nebraska's Blackshirt defense, facing its toughest challenge of the season, is
allowing only nine points a game to rank first in the Big 12 and second
nationally.  The Huskers lead the league with 26 sacks, 11 more than Kansas,
their closest challenger. That's not necessarily good news for Tech quarterback
Cody Hodges, who was sacked five times last week by the Jayhawks.

"They blitz a lot," Hodges said of the Huskers. "Probably after watching the
Kansas game, they'll blitz even more because we didn't handle it too well. We
just have to be ready for that."

TULSA'S MALZAHN PUTS MARK ON OFFENSE

BYLINE: IZZY GOULD, Times Staff Writer

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 9C

LENGTH: 382 words

DATELINE: ORLANDO


A few folks at Arkansas were probably gushing over Tulsa's high-powered passing
offense during the first half of Saturday's C-USA championship game, envisioning
what could have been.

It has been less than a year since the drama unfolded that prompted Gus Malzahn
to resign as offensive coordinator at Arkansas after one season, leading him to
accept the same job at Tulsa. Malzahn helped guide the Razorbacks to a 10-4
record and the SEC West title in 2006. But the Razorbacks primarily used a power
rushing attack headed by Heisman Trophy candidate Darren McFadden, not the
no-huddle spread offense Malzahn had been hired to implement.

Malzahn was a highly respected high school coach in Arkansas after leading
Shiloh Christian and Springdale High to state titles. His offense became known
nationwide during his final season with a group of players referred to as the
Springdale Five, led by highly coveted quarterback Mitch Mustain. Mustain joined
Malzahn at Arkansas and started eight games as a freshman. After Malzahn's
departure, Mustain transferred to Southern California.

At Tulsa, Malzahn has helped develop quarterback Paul Smith, who is the nation's
third-leading passer and C-USA co-offensive player of the year. The Golden
Hurricane entered Saturday's game with the nation's top-rated offense with 548.6
yards per game.

Tulsa is headed to the GMAC Bowl on Jan. 6 in Mobile, Ala., to face Bowling
Green.

The Trampoline: Bright House Networks Stadium has a nickname: the trampoline.
When fans in the student section jump on the metal bleachers in unison the
stadium feels like a trampoline. The shaking is so intense the press box swayed
several times Saturday. School officials told the Orlando Sentinel on Friday the
stadium is structurally safe.

New stadium a hit: Bright House Networks Stadium opened on UCF's campus this
season and proved to be a hit. The Knights averaged 44,001 ticket sales in six
regular-season home games - a league high - including three sellouts. The
largest crowd was 46,103 for a 47-13 homecoming win against Marshall on Nov. 3.

Special play: UCF junior Joe Burnett's 83-yard punt return in the first quarter
was his third career punt return for a score. His last punt return also came
against Tulsa, when he brought one back 68 yards in the 2005 title game.

Coaches get defensive about offense

BYLINE: By Kathleen Nelson ST. LOUIS POST-DISPATCH Writers in other cities
contributed information to this notebook.

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. C2

LENGTH: 730 words


Life in "The OC," as the TV promos suggest, may be hot, but life as an OC can
put you on the hot seat.

Two offensive coordinators, Jim Fassel of Baltimore and Keith Rowan of Arizona,
lost their jobs this week, and, in the process, became scapegoats for what ails
their former teams.

The Ravens are 4-2 and first in the AFC North. They rank 18th in scoring, with
18.3 points per game, up from 25th (16.6) last year. So, what's the big deal?

Reports in Baltimore indicated that mutiny was brewing among the players and
assistant coaches.

"Everywhere I've been, I've gotten the offense up and running pretty fast,"
Fassel told ESPN. "It didn't happen here, and the reason I believe is that I
wasn't in full control.

"This has been building for quite a while and finally I went to (head coach
Brian Billick) last week and said, 'Look, Brian, you've always run a good
offense and I've always run a good offense, but the bottom line is somebody has
to be in charge.

"Brian was very good about this. He told me, 'You're right. My job's on the
line, and the only way I can deal with it is if I take control of the offense.'
"

The Cardinals (1-5) rank 17th in scoring, with 18.5 points per game, which
prompted coach Dennis Green to say in announcing Rowan's demotion, "We are not
scoring enough points."

OK, but Arizona's defense ranks 25th in points allowed, 23.8. Also, running back
Edgerrin James has complained that he wasn't being used enough, and Green has
second-guessed the play-calling after a each loss.

Quarterbacks coach Mike Kruczek got the promotion, a dubious distinction. He
will be Green's third offensive coordinator in 2 1/2 seasons in Arizona.

So, what's up with Billick and Green? Here's a theory: Back in 1998, Green
coached the Minnesota Vikings; Billick was his offensive coordinator. The Vikes
scored 53 of 56 times they were inside the 20 and scored 556 points, an NFL
record.

It probably didn't hurt that they had a good toolbox: receivers Cris Carter and
rookie Randy Moss, running back Robert Smith, and quarterbacks Brad Johnson and
Randall Cunningham

Green and Billick earned a reputation as offensive gurus that year and have been
trying to live up to it ever since.

---

So, we meet again

San Diego Chargers coach Marty Schottenheimer's return to Kansas City always
causes a minor stir on the western side of the state.

But the entire starting defensive line for the Denver Broncos (4-1) returns to
its old stomping ground this weekend in Cleveland: tackles Gerrard Warren and
Mike Myers, ends Ebenezer Ekuban and Kenard Lang face their former employers,
the Browns (1-4). Since acquiring Warren, the last of the four, Denver is 18-5
and reached the AFC Championship game last year. Cleveland is 7-14.

"You know what the word is? Good riddance," Ekuban said. "Gerard Warren was a
bust. Michael Myers can't play. He's just a backup guy. Ebenezer Ekuban, well,
he had one good year, but he didn't help the team win. I think it was just good
riddance. But we all had confidence in ourselves that we were better players
than our team showed."

The sparks could fly, though, when receivers Chad Johnson of the Cincinnati
Bengals and Steve Smith of the Carolina Panthers, teammates at Santa Monica
(Calif.) College, face each other in Cincinnati.

"What I see now on Sundays, Steve breaking tackles and doing all that craziness,
he was doing in junior college," Johnson said. "He was hungry about the game."

The two faced each other Dec. 8, 2002, when the Panthers beat the Bengals 52-31.
Smith had five receptions for 144 yards and a touchdown and two punt-return TDs;
Johnson caught six passes for 114 yards.

Got the coach's ear

The Chiefs' Herm Edwards said he listens and gives special treatment to only one
of the thousands of second-guessers in the greater Kansas City area: his wife,
Lia.

"Yeah, I just kiss her and say 'Honey, go back to sleep,' " he said.

Amazing stats

- The Broncos have allowed one touchdown in five games, the first team to do so
since the 1934 Detroit Lions, who shut out their first seven opponents.

- Philadelphia's Donovan McNabb completed passes to eight receivers Sunday. He
has completed passes to at least seven players in every game this season.

Quote of the week

"Instead of a Category 5 hurricane, he was a 2 or 3."

UNSTOPPABLE?;
FEW TEAMS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SHUT DOWN MINNESOTA'S HIGH-OCTANE OFFENSE THIS
SEASON, BUT THOSE THAT HAVE JUMPED OUT TO EARLY LEADS

BYLINE: Sean Jensen, Staff Writer

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 10D

LENGTH: 582 words


In this season of quick-striking, high-scoring offenses, the Vikings are left to
fend for themselves against teams with far more heralded defenses.

At the beginning of the season, the talk centered around the Super Bowl champion
St. Louis Rams and Indianapolis Colts, teams that could simply outscore
opponents. But both clubs were undone in the playoffs by the superior defenses
of the New Orleans Saints and Miami Dolphins, respectively.

But at least two NFL scouts believe only one force can stop the Vikings:
themselves.

"If a team aims to stop (Randy) Moss, (Daunte) Culpepper can go to (Cris) Carter
or dump the ball off to (Robert) Smith," said an AFC East scout, who did not
want to be identified. "And if some way or another a team finds a way to defend
all three, Culpepper can tuck the ball and run. His body is built like a
linebacker.

"Even when teams have beaten the Vikings this season, like the Bucs or Packers,
one of those four players have had a good game. You're not going to be able to
slow down the Vikings' offense, because they are going to be able to put points
on the scoreboard. You are going to have to have an offense that is just as
dangerous."

The only team that fits that mold is the Oakland Raiders, who boast the NFL's
sixth-rated offense, including the top-ranked run offense. But the Raiders are
known more for plodding their way downfield. The Raiders also have an
opportunistic defense that intercepted 21 passes and forced 16 fumbles, and they
finished the season with the fifth-rated run defense.

The Vikings, though, have had success against some of the NFL's top defenses.
Although they scored just 13 points against the Dolphins, the Vikings had 468
total yards, including 125 on the ground. And the Vikings had more than 400
total yards against other notable defenses such as the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and
the Saints.

So why do the Vikings pose such huge problems for top-notch defenses?

"There is not a combination out there that compares to Randy and Cris," an NFC
personnel director said. "There are teams with two good receivers, but there
isn't that quarterback to match them. If he has to, Daunte can go deep, and he
can run. To top it off, they have a good back.

"Even Baltimore wouldn't shut them down. They might shut down the run. But they
can't shut down both Moss and Carter."

Veteran quarterback Bubby Brister agreed, adding that the Vikings are capable of
winning any high-scoring game.

"If we play like we can play, and don't turn the ball over, we can score 24, 28,
30," Brister said. "Even if we have to go to 50, we can do that, too."

But the NFC scout said there is one way to doom the Vikings: score early on
them. Teams that have had the most success against the Vikings have built early
leads, limiting the effectiveness of Smith and forcing the Vikings to become a
one-dimensional passing team.

The Vikings' gaining an early advantage could be even more crucial Sunday
against the Giants, the NFC scout said.

"It helps with momentum, especially on the road in front of a hostile crowd," he
said. "So if they get out in front, there's no telling what's going to happen.
But if they get behind early, the crowd will get going, and the defense won't
have as much confidence."

To survive, especially out of their natural habitat (indoors, on artificial
turf) the Vikings must be the antagonist, attacking the Giants and controlling
the momentum. If not, another Vikings season could end in disappointment.

WVU FOOTBALL;
Holgorsen finalist for Bryant Award

BYLINE: Staff report

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. P4B

LENGTH: 282 words


West Virginia University football coach Dana Holgorsen has found himself in the
running for another major award following his Mountaineers' 10-2 finish to the
2016 season. Holgorsen is one of nine finalists for the Paul "Bear" Bryant Coach
of the Year Award, voted on by the National Sports Media Association.

Holgorsen joins Wisconsin's Paul Chryst, Western Michigan's P.J. Fleck, Penn
State's James Franklin, Southern California's Clay Helton, Colorado's Mike
MacIntyre, Alabama's Nick Saban, Oklahoma's Bob Stoops and Clemson's Dabo
Swinney as finalists. The winner will be announced live on Jan. 11, 2017 during
the awards banquet at the Toyota Center in Houston.

The Mountaineers reached the double-digit win plateau for just the ninth time in
program history this season, and the 2016 team was just the sixth WVU team to
accomplish that feat in the regular season. Holgorsen has been at the helm of
two of those teams with at least 10 victories.

West Virginia has been ranked in the Top 25 of both the USA Today coaches poll
and Associated Press media poll every week since the Oct. 3 polls and reached
the top 10 twice.

In the national rankings, WVU's offense is ranked No. 12 in total offense, No.
13 in first-down offense, No. 18 in rushing offense, No. 24 in passing yards per
completion, No. 29 in pass efficiency and No. 30 in pass offense. Defensively,
WVU is No. 10 in turnovers gained, No. 19 in fumbles recovered, No. 23 in passes
intercepted, No. 31 in turnover margin, No. 32 in pass efficiency defense and
No. 36 in scoring defense.

The No. 14 Mountaineers play Miami in the Russell Athletic Bowl at 5:30 p.m. on
Wednesday, Dec. 28, at Camping World Stadium in Orlando, Florida.

Wizards acknowledge difficulty of Princeton offense

SECTION: SPORTS; P-com Biggie Sports; Pg. 56

LENGTH: 317 words


The 76ers are still learning Eddie Jordan's Princeton offense. The Washington
Wizards, who worked in the read-and-react, pass-and-cut schemes for five
seasons-plus, can relate.

"When we first got in Eddie's offense, we struggled that year," Wizards guard
Gilbert Arenas told reporters yesterday. "We struggled bad that year. Then the
next couple years we got better. It's like when you're in a system for a while
and you're transferring to a new system, things take a while.

"There are so many 'reads.' You have to read each other. I call it the thinking
man's offense. If you don't have a very high IQ, you're always going to be lost.
It took me and Larry [former Wizards and Sixers guard Larry Hughes] the whole
summer to depict and figure out how we could move without running into somebody,
because it's so many cutbacks that, if you back-door at the wrong time, you're
running into players. You need five passers, five shooters. Athletes don't work
in that offense, to be honest."

Said forward Antawn Jamison: "There was still a lot of room for improvement for
us, and we've been with the system for a while. But that's one thing about Eddie
- he's going to be very passionate about his system and what he's trying to do.
I don't know how well [the Sixers] are running it, but any time you have guys
like Elton Brand and [Andre] Iguodala, it's going to be tough for any team."

Six ShotsJason Kapono, who sat out Saturday night's loss in Cleveland with a
sprained ankle, went through yesterday's full practice and was expected to be
available tonight . . . The Sixers play tomorrow night in Boston, then return
home Friday night against Atlanta before heading out on a four-game trip that
starts Nov. 29 and takes them to San Antonio, Dallas, Oklahoma City and
Charlotte . . . ESPN has dropped the Sixers' Dec. 9 game against Detroit from
its TV schedule, replacing it with Chicago at Atlanta.

Immigration report challenged;
Program nabs minor offenders, group says.;
Gwinnett sheriff calls enforcement findings 'false and misleading.'

BYLINE: Jeremy Redmon; Staff

SECTION: METRO NEWS; Pg. 6B

LENGTH: 655 words


An immigration enforcement program operating in Atlanta area jails is mostly
catching people who commit traffic offenses and misdemeanors and should be
overhauled to focus on more serious criminals, a Washington-based think tank
said in a report released Monday.

Of those booked into Cobb County's jail and held for immigration authorities
through the 287(g) program last fiscal year, about 80 percent had committed
misdemeanors or traffic offenses, according to the Migration Policy Institute's
report. During the same time, more than half of the people held on detainers
through Gwinnett's program were for the same types of crimes, the report said.

Gwinnett Sheriff Butch Conway called the institute's findings "false and
misleading." He said people identified through Gwinnett's program could have
committed other crimes or could have been deported previously.

Through the 287(g) program, state and local police are given the power to help
enforce federal immigration laws. State lawmakers are now considering
legislation aimed at expanding the program in Georgia.

The independent institute, which analyzes international migration and policy,
said it also studied 287(g) programs in California, Colorado, Maryland and
Virginia. Nationally, about half of people held on detainers for the U.S.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have committed misdemeanors or traffic
offenses, most of which were for driving under the influence or driving without
a license, according to the institute's report. The other half had committed
felonies and other serious crimes. The 10 communities --- including Cobb ---
with the largest share of detainers placed on people committing traffic offenses
are located in the Southeast, the report said.

The institute said that using the program to catch as many illegal immigrants as
possible is causing immigrants to avoid public places, stop driving, mistrust
authorities and become reluctant to report crimes. It also is driving up federal
detention costs for suspected illegal immigrants facing deportation, the report
said.

"We believe if fewer people were brought in on traffic offenses and misdemeanors
in Cobb and Gwinnett counties, that this would improve relations between the
local police departments and the immigrant community," Randy Capps, a senior
policy analyst and demographer for the institute, told reporters during a
conference call Monday.

ICE is responsible for picking up people being held on detainers through 287(g)
programs within 48 hours. The federal agency may decide to set them free. It may
detain them in federal jails, or release them on bond while seeking to deport
them. ICE officials said they are focused on deporting non-citizens who are
identified through the program and who have committed violent crimes, including
killers, rapists, kidnappers and robbers.

A spokeswoman for ICE said the institute's report "fails to acknowledge that
certain misdemeanors --- such as drunk driving and domestic violence --- are of
serious concern, undermine public safety, and warrant ICE's attention."

From 2006 through Nov. 14, 2010, more than 185,000 people amenable to
deportation have been identified through the 287(g) program, according to ICE.
Of those, more than 130,000 have been deported. Last fiscal year, about 62
percent of the 287(g) cases handled by ICE were for felonies and driving under
the influence charges combined.

Gwinnett's sheriff released a prepared statement about the institute's report
Monday.

"ICE's figures show that of the inmates we released to them, only 21.8 percent
of our cases were traffic-related," Conway said. "It is disheartening that
organizations feel they have to stoop to this level to further muddy the waters
on immigration in this country. But, at this point, I think I would be shocked
if one of these groups actually put out an honest and truthful report."

Cobb Sheriff Neil Warren did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

Bears focus on division title

BYLINE: From news services

SECTION: SPORTS

LENGTH: 654 words


The Chicago Bears are trying to forget about their blowout loss at home to New
England.

One sure way to let it go: With a win in their next game -- Monday night against
the Vikings -- the Bears would clinch the NFC North title if the Green Bay
Packers lose to the Patriots a day earlier.

"We know what is in front of us," center Olin Kreutz said. "We can win the NFC
North. We know that's still in our hands, and we're still the No. 2 seed in the
NFC. So we still have everything in front of us."

The Bears (9-4) were eager to focus on the divisional race after Sunday's 36-7
drubbing.

Chicago appeared shaky on offense and defense against New England, yielding a
season high in yardage and points while committing four turnovers on offense.
The defeat included the most points the Bears have ever allowed in a half at
home (33).

Coach Lovie Smith said both the offense and defense found it easy to put the
defeat behind after reviewing game film. The Bears came out of the game without
any new significant injuries.

"Maybe a week from today we're celebrating being the NFC North champs," tight
end Greg Olsen said.

Charges carry life sentence: Denver Broncos rookie cornerback Perrish Cox could
face up to life in prison if convicted of sexual assault charges filed by
prosecutors last week.

A portion of the case unsealed by a Douglas County judge Tuesday shows the
sexual assault charges are Class 3 and Class 4 felonies, which carry a sentence
of between two years to life in prison. They involve a helpless victim.

Other details of the case remain sealed.

Cox, who played in the Broncos' loss to the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday, is free
on $50,000 bail.

Cox could face a four-game suspension from the NFL next season for violating the
league's personal conduct code.

Owens blames coaches: Receiver Terrell Owens says the Cincinnati Bengals' lousy
season is the result of underachieving "from the top down," and he particularly
points a finger at the coaches.

Teammate Chad Ochocinco asked Owens during "The T.Ocho Show" on Versus cable
network Tuesday night why he thinks the team is 2-11.

"I think there's underachieving from the top down," Owens said. "You start with
the owner, you start with the coaches. And obviously we as players, we are a
product of what the coaches are coaching us throughout the course of the week.

"Of course, we have to go out there and play the game. But in order for us to do
what we're allowed to do at the best of our abilities, the coaches have to put
the players in the best position."

Briefly: Buffalo receiver Lee Evans was placed on season-ending injured reserve
two days after sustaining a sprained ankle in Buffalo's victory over Cleveland.

Evans' streak of playing in 109 straight games, including 71 consecutive starts,
will be snapped Sunday when the Bills play at the Miami Dolphins. The 71 total
was the second-longest active streak for a receiver behind Indianapolis' Reggie
Wayne (126).


     ·    Seattle placed wide receiver Deon Butler on injured reserve with a
          broken right leg and signed offensive lineman Paul Fanaika off
          Cleveland's practice squad.



     ·    Washington cut the holder who mishandled the extra-point attempt in
          the one-point loss to Tampa Bay.


The Redskins waived punter Hunter Smith and replaced him with Sam Paulescu, who
takes over as punter and holder.


     ·    A federal judge in San Francisco tossed out a lawsuit by several
          retired players who are dissatisfied with a $26 million settlement
          between the union and about 2,000 retirees.



     ·    Philadelphia signed two-time Pro Bowl defensive end Derrick Burgess to
          replace injured rookie Brandon Graham. New England cut Burgess before
          the season.



     ·    Tampa Bay placed defensive tackle Gerald McCoy and linebacker Quincy
          Black on injured reserve. Defensive end George Johnson and linebacker
          Tyrone McKenzie were promoted from the practice squad to fill the
          roster spots.



     ·    Tennessee placed starting center Eugene Amano on injured reserve
          because of a neck injury.

EDITORIAL: As others crack down on texting, so should S. Dakota

BYLINE: The Daily Republic, Mitchell, S.D.

SECTION: COMMENTARY

LENGTH: 423 words


July 28--States around us are cracking down on drivers who text while behind the
wheel and we wonder how long it will be before South Dakota lawmakers finally
outlaw this dangerous practice.

On July 1, Wyoming made it official. On that day, it became illegal to use a
handheld device to text while driving. It's a primary offense in Wyoming,
meaning violators can be pulled over by law-enforcement officers for that
offense only. The fine is $75.

Nebraska also recently passed a law against texting while driving, although it's
only a secondary offense in that state. That's somewhat like the seat-belt law
here in South Dakota -- officers cannot pull a driver over simply for a
secondary offense, but they can write a ticket for that secondary offense if
they stop a driver for another reason.

Minnesota and Iowa have laws against this bad habit, too. In fact, 30 states now
have some sort of law against texting and driving.

And here in South Dakota, there is no law, although a texting-while-driving
proposal was discussed before failing in the Legislature. North Dakota and
Montana have no laws against texting while driving, either.

An editorial by the Rapid City Journal that appeared in Saturday's Daily
Republic cited a few disturbing statistics about texting and driving, including
this one: 37 percent of people ages 18 to 27, in a Nationwide Insurance study,
said they send text messages while driving.

And here's another: South Dakota ranks among the very bottom of the 50 states in
the "2010 Roadmap Report on State Highway Safety Laws."

The Journal notes that our state has a terrible record with highway safety
legislation. We wholeheartedly agree.

We see so many people working the buttons of their cell phones while driving.
And we suspect the people who do it would even admit that it's wrong, even if
it's not illegal.

These people need a nudge from state lawmakers. They need to be told that this
nasty habit will eventually affect their pocketbook.

It's time for South Dakota to join the majority of other states in the nation
and make texting while driving illegal.

Study Shows Rise in Number Of Women Jailed for Drugs

BYLINE: By MONTE WILLIAMS

SECTION: Section B;  Page 18;  Column 5;  Metropolitan Desk

LENGTH: 605 words


A new national study shows a remarkable surge in the number of women
incarcerated for drug offenses: an 888 percent jump between 1986 and 1996, in
comparison with a rise of 129 percent for nondrug offenses, researchers said.

And in New York State, almost the entire increase in the number of women
sentenced to prison was a result of drug offenses, according to the study,
results of which were released early last month.

The study, a 26-page booklet titled "Gender and Justice: Women, Drugs and
Sentencing Policy," was researched and written by the Sentencing Project, a
national nonprofit organization that promotes sentencing reform and conducts
research on criminal justice issues.

Since 1980, the number of women in prison has increased at nearly double the
rate for men. Minority women, especially blacks in New York State, are
disproportionately affected by drug arrests and imprisonment, the study found.

"There are more men in prison for drug offenses than women," said Marc Mauer,
assistant director of the Sentencing Project and co-author of the report. "But
of the women in prison, they are more likely to be incarcerated for drug
offenses than the men in prison."

Of the women in prison for drug offenses in three states singled out by the
study -- New York, California and Minnesota -- researchers found substantial
variation. Those states were chosen because of geographical differences, varying
sentencing structures, and good data.

In New York, nearly all -- 91 percent -- of the increase in women sentenced to
prison from 1986 to 1995 was in connection with drug offenses. In California,
drug offenses represented 55 percent of the increase; in Minnesota, 26 percent.

Of the women sentenced to prison for drug offenses in the three states, many
were members of minority groups -- 91 percent in New York, 54 percent in
California and 27 percent in Minnesota -- numbers substantially greater than the
minority proportion of each state's population.

The impact of the justice system on Hispanic women varied from state to state.
In New York, in 1995, Hispanic women constituted 44 percent of the women
imprisoned for drug offenses, but only 14 percent of the state's population. In
California Hispanic women represented 25 percent of imprisoned drug offenders
and 31 percent of the population.

New York State officials said they could neither confirm nor contradict the
findings because they had not had time to study the report. "But what I can
say," said Caroline Quartararo, spokeswoman for the governor's criminal justice
director, Katherine N. Lapp, "is that of the first-time felony drug offenders --
male or female -- fewer than 10 percent received prison sentences."

Mr. Mauer said there were numerous factors that snared women in the criminal
justice system: the impact of drug abuse on low-income women; declining economic
opportunities for many women; limited treatment options and the harsh
mandatory-sentence policies adopted in conjunction with the war on drugs.

Mr. Mauer also theorized that a greater percentage of women than men were
incarcerated because men were often able to cut a deal with prosecutors. "I've
heard this anecdotally," he said. "The men may not be the major drug dealer, so
they can cooperate with prosecutors by giving them the name of the major dealer.
The women may know only their boyfriend as a dealer."

Mr. Mauer said the solution for the high rate of women's incarceration for drug
offenses was drug rehabilitation treatment. "I think there are studies that show
a dollar of treatment is more effective than a dollar spent in incarceration,"
he said.

THE RUNDOWN

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. D18

LENGTH: 617 words

Houston (-3) at Atlanta, 1 p.m.

The game only a snooty U-Va. fan (is there any other kind?) could enjoy. The
Falcons are reeling after unloading a couple former Wahoos -- QB Matt Schaub (to
Houston) and DE Patrick Kerney (Seattle) -- and thanks to some rather unwise
decisions by a couple former Hokies, Michael Vick and DeAngelo Hall.

New York Jets (-3) at Buffalo, 1 p.m.

Bills starting QB Trent Edwards, a rookie from Stanford, must feel as if he has
spent the past year-plus playing for the Washington Generals against the Harlem
Globetrotters. The Cardinal went 1-11 last year; the Bills are 0-3.

Baltimore (-4 1/2 ) at Cleveland, 1 p.m. (WUSA-9, WJZ-13)

Browns Coach Romeo Crennel has lost 17 of 18 coaches' challenges, according to
the Cleveland Plain Dealer. That's about the same percentage as Bieler's lock of
the week.

St. Louis (+13) at Dallas, 1 p.m. (WTTG-5)

Maybe the preseason does count for something. The Rams' starting offense did not
score a touchdown in the preseason. Through three regular season games, the Rams
are averaging less than 11 points. They are 25th in total offense, 22nd in
rushing offense, 20th in passing offense and 32nd in red zone scoring.

Chicago (-3) at Detroit, 1 p.m.

Even Rex Grossman would like his chances against the Lions' secondary: They gave
up 381 yards and four touchdowns to the Eagles last week. But Grossman has been
benched in favor of Brian Griese.

Oakland (+4) at Miami, 1 p.m.

To those who think Joe Gibbs has lost a step, consider that his game plan for
the Dolphins in Week 1 has been copied by every opponent since. The Redskins
used personnel groups to put Miami into its "nickel" defense, i.e., it inserts
an extra defensive back and takes out a defensive tackle. The offense then runs
the ball against the smaller defensive line. DT Vonnie Holliday said the
Redskins "opened a can of worms" with that plan.

Green Bay (-2) at Minnesota, 1 p.m.

The Vikings have a very solid defense. They are giving up 12 points per game and
have scored three touchdowns -- two on interception returns and one on a fumble
return.

Tampa Bay (+3) at Carolina, 4:05 p.m.

Former Houston Texans punching bag David Carr is expected to start for the
Panthers. He was sacked 249 times in five seasons in Houston. He will be
throwing to WR Steve Smith, who has four straight 100-yard games against the
Buccaneers.

Seattle (-2) at San Francisco, 4:05 p.m.

Interesting matchup is 49ers running back Frank Gore (356 yards in two games
against the Seahawks last year) against safeties Deon Grant and Brian Russell.
They were acquired in the offseason to address poor open-field tackling that
Gore exposed last year.

Pittsburgh (-5 1/2 ) at Arizona, 4:15 p.m. (WUSA-9, WJZ-13)

At last, something likable about the Cardinals: Radio analyst Ron Wolfey.
According to the Arizona Republic, some "Wolfey-isms" include "Neil Rackers
could kick a can of tuna through a colander" and "two rights don't make a wrong,
but two dings definitely make a dong."

Denver (+9 1/2 ) at Indianapolis, 4:15 p.m.

The town called "India-noplace" has not been kind to Mike Shanahan and the
Broncos: They have been outscored 136-75 in their past four games there.

Kansas City (+12) at San Diego, 4:15 p.m.

Line of the week, from the Sports Network: "If the Chargers lose this week,
[Coach Norv] Turner might want to hire someone else to start his car."

Philadelphia (-2 1/2 ) at New York Giants, 8:15 p.m. (WRC-4, WBAL-11)

Eagles WR Reggie Brown is honest. When told he has 64 receiving yards this year,
his response was: "Sixty-four yards? That's more than I thought."

New England (-7 1/2 ) at Cincinnati, tomorrow, 8:30 p.m. (ESPN)

The Bengals have given up eight touchdown passes over the past two weeks.

NFL: FALCONS' NEW COACH: Offensive prowess draws admiration

BYLINE: CHIP TOWERS; Staff

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 5D

LENGTH: 494 words


When Brian Brohm was being recruited to play quarterback out of Louisville's
Trinity High, most in town assumed he'd play for the hometown Cardinals because
his father and two brothers went there.

But according to his dad, there was much more to the decision.

"Brian was the No. 1 offensive player in the country coming out of high school
and he wanted to play in the NFL someday," Oscar Brohm said Monday. "He could
have gone anywhere and was considering a lot of places. So it wasn't a slam dunk
that he'd actually go to Louisville.

"He went there because we were impressed with Bobby Petrino. We knew he was an
excellent offensive coach and he ran a pro-style offense. He went there because
of the offense."

When it comes to knowing offense, few on the college level have earned a better
reputation than Petrino, who on Monday was introduced as the Falcons' new coach.

ABC analyst Terry Bowden said he spent a lot of time the past month or so
looking at offenses with his father, Florida State coach Bobby Bowden. The elder
Bowden decided to completely retool his offense after this season and was
enlisting his son's help to identify the best schemes in the country.

"We really liked what Bobby Petrino was doing at Louisville," Terry Bowden said
Monday.

"We were trying to look for offenses that not just put up big numbers but were
also fundamentally sound and not gimmicky. His offenses are always well-balanced
between the run and the pass and very productive. We thought it was the best we
saw. We wondered if his brother might be available."

For the record, Paul Petrino wasn't. Bobby Petrino's younger brother and
offensive coordinator is a candidate to become Louisville's new head coach.

Jim Donnan, once considered a bit of an offensive guru himself, said he has
admired Bobby Petrino's work for years.

"This guy is a very astute game-planner," said Donnan, a former Georgia coach
and current ESPN analyst. "He fashions his offenses around his talent. Look at
how he's been able to use the power running game with the drop-back passing
game. The guy knows what he's doing."

In Petrino's four years as head coach at Louisville, his teams finished fifth,
first, ninth and second nationally in total offense. They've also been third or
better in scoring each of the past three years. This season's unit averaged
475.3 yards (second only to Hawaii's 559.2) and 37.7 points a game.

Now, the only question is whether Petrino's offense will be successful in the
NFL. Donnan, for one, thinks so.

"He did a good job of running the offense for the [Jacksonvile] Jaguars, so he
understands the pro game," Donnan said. "He understands all the nuances of
personnel groupings. He used a lot of groups at Louisville --- two tight ends,
two backs, three wideouts, four wideouts, no backs.

"I think too much is made about who can do what in college and the pros. He'll
be good. He's a driven guy; he's a football guy; he's a lifer. He grew up with
football, so he'll do a good job."

A Not-So-Welcome Change for Terps; Offense Ranks as One of Worst in I-A

David Nakamura , Washington Post Staff Writer

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. D04

LENGTH: 927 words


The Maryland football team entered preseason camp determined to transform the
offense, with Coach Mark Duffner switching from the run-and-shoot attack to an
I-formation. But four games into the season, the more telling change is this:
The Terrapins have gone from being one of the top offenses in the country in
1993 to being ranked 106th out of the nation's 111 Division I-A teams this week
in total offense.

"Who wants to play in an offense that's struggling?" senior wide receiver Geroy
Simon wondered this week. "To have two bad weeks like that on offense, it's
frustrating. But if you're any kind of competitor, you're going to come out the
next week and keep trying to play hard until you get things together. Everybody
has to be accountable for their actions. We've got to step up and make plays."

After the Terrapins opened the season with comfortable victories over unheralded
Northern Illinois and Alabama-Birmingham, they have totaled three points and 230
yards in losses to Virginia and West Virginia. The Terrapins (2-2) are averaging
242.3 yards of offense per game and 18.0 points per game (which ties them for
80th in the nation). Their rushing offense is averaging 119.3 yards (84th) and
their passing offense is averaging 123.0 yards (101st).

What happened to the production Maryland had in 1993, when the run-and-shoot
racked up 439.6 yards and 22.1 points per game? And, for that matter, why not
return to the run-and-shoot?

"The thing you've got to guard against right now is going all over the place,"
Duffner said. "Last year, when we made a change to this style of offense, there
was a real need to."

Perhaps it's fitting that the Terrapins play host to North Carolina State on
Saturday. Last season, they entered the N.C. State game after the run-and-shoot
offense was shut out in back-to-back losses to Clemson and Louisville. Against
the Wolfpack, Duffner unveiled the two-back formation, with Buddy Rodgers and
Jermaine Lewis in the backfield. The Terrapins rushed for 155 yards, passed for
137 yards, controlled the clock and won the game, 30-13.

Yet that sort of production has been absent the past two games. Maryland's
offensive line has been dominated at the line of scrimmage, Rodgers and
quarterback Brian Cummings have been injured, Lewis's graduation has left the
receiving corps in shambles and the Terrapins' collection of tight ends and
fullbacks has been unproductive.

When asked if the players are losing confidence in the running game, Duffner
said: "It's a little bit shaken right now. We're working like crazy to get that
back. We're trying to be a balanced offensive team. . . . We were just poor at
running the football, especially against West Virginia. If we're going to be an
effective offensive football team, we've got to run the football productively."

In past seasons, Maryland's run-and-shoot put fear into opposing defensive
backs. But this season, opposing teams have stacked seven players at the line of
scrimmage to stop the run. Thus, the offensive line has been overwhelmed at
times. Duffner said he is contemplating changes along the line, with Aaron Henne
possibly replacing Mitch Watkins at right guard. Fullback Mario Chavez (a former
linebacker) and tight ends Craig Fitzgerald (a former defensive lineman) and Tim
Brown (a junior college transfer) have not panned out as well as Duffner had
hoped. Duffner benched Chavez for three quarters against West Virginia and tried
defensive end Al Wallace at tight end in the second half.

"Ever since preseason, we feel that practice has definitely been on a consistent
level of improvement," center Erik Greenstein said. "That's why we don't know
exactly why the games are turning out like they are."

Maryland's passing attack has been unable to free up the running game. Lewis was
one of the fastest players in the country; without him, Maryland's deep passing
game has been nearly nonexistent, with senior Mancel Johnson struggling since
his return from a two-game suspension. In four games last year, Cummings
completed 52 passes. In four games this year, he's completed 32.

Meanwhile, the offensive backfield has been plagued by injuries. Rodgers has
been playing all season with an injured quadriceps muscle, and he suffered a
hip-pointer Saturday. Fellow junior tailback Brian Underwood played poorly
against Virginia and was relegated to fourth string against West Virginia.
Cummings suffered a separated right (throwing) shoulder against Virginia, then
threw four interceptions against West Virginia.

"I played real timid," Cummings said. "I shied away after throwing the ball. I
was trying to avoid pain by throwing over the side, which is not the way you
throw a football."

Ironically, Maryland's defense, the nation's worst in 1993, is ranked the ninth
in the country this week. But Duffner and the offensive players insist they
won't panic. Although Duffner said he plans to mix up his play calling more
against the Wolfpack, he said he is committed to the run-based offense.

"We planned on being 4-0 and it didn't pan out that way," Cummings said. "We
could panic in the locker room, which would cause major havoc, but we're not
doing that. We did play two quality teams the past two weeks, although we're not
making excuses. We do have seven more opportunities. Offensively, we've just got
to get it together."

Terrapins Notes: Duffner said freshman running back Damone Boone of West
Springfield High School will be redshirted. Boone has not played since a brief
appearance in the opening game.

Stats don't always match the records

The fantasy football season felt like it was over, but unlike any other sport,
we feel a strong urge to continue the play into the postseason. Maybe we need
things to do as the cold forces us inside, maybe we seek any possible little of
joy to combat the holiday hangover or maybe we just like excuses to sit in front
of the TV and drink more beer.

(Yes honey, there are games on Saturday. Yes honey, they count. Yes honey, this
is important.)

Just as there are many reasons why we love to keep playing, there are many ways
NFL teams made it to the playoffs.

Overall, and with rather apparent reason, a playoff team usually does at least
one thing very well. The top five offensive teams are in the playoffs, as are
six of the top seven and seven of the top 10.

The top five defensive teams are also in the playoffs, but things drop from
there. One has to go down to No. 19 before getting to the next squad, Denver,
and can then travel all the way down to Philadelphia at No. 29.

Most of those subpar defensive teams are the really good offensive squads,
though. If you consistently put up enough points against your opponents, they
are going to have to air out their passing game to try to catch up. The
aforementioned Broncos and Eagles, after all, were the No. 1 and 2 offenses in
the league, respectively.

Conversely, the most elite defenses need not have great offenses to be
successful. The Seahawks had the league's best defense, but ranked only 17th in
offense; the Panthers were the No. 2 defense and only 26th on the other side of
the ball.

Only two teams made the playoffs seeming to not be really good at anything in
particular. The Colts seem to be developing under young quarterback Andrew Luck,
but are only the No. 15 offense. They also had Robert Mathis leading the league
with 19.5 sacks, but the team checked in at only No. 20 on defense.

The Chiefs' Jamaal Charles tied for the league lead with 12 touchdowns, but it
shouldn't be that surprising that an Alex Smith-led offense finished the season
ranked only 21st. The Kansas City defense looked good for a time earlier this
season, largely based on the fact that it scored seven touchdowns as a unit, but
it finished the season ranked only 24th overall.

It was nice of the Chiefs D to put that in microcosm Saturday against the
Chiefs, getting four turnovers but also giving up a 28-point lead.

The Colts also had their moments of ineptness, which is necessary to fall behind
by 28 points Maybe there is something to those teams' mediocre numbers after
all.

Maybe the Patriots should also then be hoping to face Indianapolis come Saturday
night instead of Cincinnati.

The playoff team with the best offense/defense combination is the New Orleans
Saints, who finished as both the fourth-ranked offense and defense. Even then,
they did not secure their spot until the final week of the season. By the time
you have read this, they also may have played their final game of the season.

The Bengals are also a balanced squad, taking the 10th-ranked offense and No. 3
defense into today's game against the Chargers. San Diego only wrapped up its
playoff spot with early help from the Ravens and Dolphins last Sunday and late
help from the officiating crew, but it did have the league's fifth-ranked
offense this season behind a bit of resurgence from Philip Rivers, whose 32 TDs
were the most he had thrown since 34 in 2008.

Still, there is a reason why Cincinnati is a touchdown favorite while every
other game this weekend hovered around a field goal.

The last of those closer contests is today's late game, which has the defending
NFC champion 49ers going to Lambeau Field to take on Green Bay. That's a pretty
solid story line already for wild-card weekend.

Add in the subplot of quarterback Aaron Rodgers and receiver Randall Cobb
returning to the Packers last week and connecting on two touchdown passes in a
winner-takes-the-NFC-North battle with the Bears, and things feel even richer
and fuller.

This is also a strength-vs.-strength matchup. The Packers, even without Rodgers
for eight weeks, had the NFL's third-best offense. The 49ers counter with the
league's fifth-best defensive unit.

Whether a good defense can beat a good offense will be forever debated with no
real answer since one is only attainable when addressing specific situations and
not an overall grand theory. I am hoping Green Bay comes out on top, though. My
postseason strategy was heavy with Packers and Broncos, as I bet on the
offensive side of the equation.

Hopefully predicting such things will be the one thing I can do well.

Bob Sansevere: Minnesota Vikings' offense and stadium need a change in a plans

BYLINE: Pioneer Press

SECTION: COLUMNISTS; Bob Sansvere; Daily Dose; Sports

LENGTH: 248 words


Itemizing a few things related to the Vikings ...

Item: Adrian Peterson is named the NFL's offensive rookie of the month for
September.

I think: The West Coast offense can be very effective ... with the right
personnel. The Vikings are missing an important piece to having a successful
West Coast offense: an effective quarterback. Instead of making his players fit
an offense, Vikings coach Brad Childress should make his offense fit his
players. That means building the offense around Peterson. Childress needs to
watch old footage of some of those Joe Gibbs teams that went with two tight ends
and plowed defenses behind a running attack.

Item: Vikings owner Zygi Wilf says "The fans are great here. I don't think
there's much frustration. I think there is a lot of patience here ..."

I think: He doesn't have a clue.

Item: Wilf plans to ask the 2008 Legislature for help building a new stadium.

I think: He can ask. But it's likely he will be told the state has more pressing
financial issues related to bridges and infrastructure. Like most NFL owners,
Wilf appears to believe it's an entitlement to get state help in building a new
stadium. But if he wants one any time soon, he will have to build it himself.

Item: The Tampa Bay Buccaneers try to acquire Mewelde Moore from the Vikings.

I think: The Vikings should tell the Bucs it's a deal if they can persuade Jake
Plummer to come out of retirement and make him part of the trade.

ABC OFFICIALS GET THEIR WISH;
VIKINGS-BUCS WILL BE PIVOTAL IN NFC CENTRAL RACE

BYLINE: GREG JOHNSON, STAFF WRITER

SECTION: SPORTS; NOTEBOOK; Pg. 6D

LENGTH: 669 words


When the "Monday Night Football" schedule was released, ABC-TV officials said
they hoped the Minnesota Vikings-Tampa Bay matchup would be a pivotal game, with
first place in the NFC Central Division on the line.

Both the Vikings and Buccaneers are atop the NFC Central standings, along with
the Detroit Lions, at 7-4. The Lions play host to the Washington Redskins on
Sunday.

The Vikings and Tampa Bay have rebounded from slow starts. The Vikings have won
five in a row and the Buccaneers are on a four-game winning streak as they head
to Monday night's showdown.

The game also presents a contrast in styles. The Vikings have one of the NFL's
most powerful offenses; Tampa Bay has one of the league's dominating defenses.

On the other side of the ball, the Vikings' defense is ranked 30th in the
league, and Tampa Bay's offense is 26th.

Vikings coach Dennis Green believes it's the kind of matchup fans want to see.

"It is because we're rated No. 1 in pass offense," Green said. "We're vastly
improving as an offense. They're rated in the top 1, 2 or 3 in different aspects
of defense. People love to see a matchup of offense versus defense. And that
normally means that other people are going to be a factor.

"It rarely comes down to one segment of the game. Even though, on the surface,
it looks like our offense versus their defense, because they're going to make
some plays on defense, we're going to make some plays on offense.

"It's going to come down to what our defense can do against their offense. And
an offense that's a little bit different than the ones that we've faced in the
past. ... I think you're going to see all aspects of this kind of game, and
that's what's going to make it a great ballgame."

This will be the first of three consecutive night games for the Vikings, who
play at the Kansas City Chiefs on Dec. 12, and play host to the Green Bay
Packers on Dec. 20.

"The big thing that will take place is that you have to have the ability to
adapt," Green said. "We think we are a team that knows how to adapt. The first
game will be a very demanding game, and it will be at 9 o'clock at night (EST).
I think our guys have played fairly well in those type of games.

"The second game is going to be very difficult because we'll get back around 4
o'clock in the morning on Tuesday and have to get a game plan ready, and then
start practicing on Wednesday, then we hit the road again with Kansas City.

"What we have to do is look at one game. Look at the first game and say, 'How
can we get our sixth consecutive win? How can we get our record to 8-4?' We
can't worry about the next game until we get through the first one. I think the
league is very excited about the kind of matchups they get. I think it'll
probably be the highest-rated Monday night game."

Vikings defensive lineman John Randle will have to go on a tear in the last five
games to reach the 10-sack plateau for an eighth consecutive season. Through 11
games, Randle has four sacks and didn't have a tackle Sunday in the Vikings'
35-27 victory over the San Diego Chargers.

Randle pressured San Diego quarterback Jim Harbaugh on the play in which strong
safety Robert Griffith intercepted a pass at the 2-yard line with 4:29 left in
the game. The Vikings' offense ran out the clock for the victory.

The Buccaneers have not had much success slowing down the Vikings' trio of
receivers - Cris Carter, Randy Moss and Jake Reed.

In 20 career games against Tampa Bay, Carter has 89 receptions for 1,099 yards
and eight touchdowns.

Moss has faced the Buccaneers three times and has 10 catches for 267 yards and
four touchdowns, including his first two TDs in the 1998 regular-season opener.

Reed has 43 receptions for 702 yards and three TDs, including a 56-yarder last
season in Raymond James Stadium.

Youth football star named All-American

BYLINE: By Nick Mallard, nmallard@sentinelandenterprise.com

SECTION: SPORTS

LENGTH: 424 words


PEPPERELL -- During a week when high school football players begin to dream of
playing at Gillette Stadium, Jacob Scholefield is eyeing Daytona Beach.

While high school giridiron stars are aiming to land in the Super Bowl in
Foxboro, the locale for Scholefield's big game at the end of the year will be a
bit warmer.

A 13-year-old Pop Warner standout for the North Middlesex Cowboys, Scholefield
was invited to participate in the 10th annual Offense-Defense Bowl Week in Dec.,
after being named an All-American at an Offense-Defense camp over the summer.

"It's pretty exciting," said Scholefield, an eighth grader at Nissitissit Middle
School in Pepperell. "I'm really excited about the opportunity to get on the
field with other players and keep learning.

"There were a bunch of kids my age at the camp. There were players from New
York, Rhode Island, Massachusetts. ... We did one week of training together. It
was a good learning experience."

The Offense-Defense Bowl Week runs from Dec. 28-Jan. 2 in Daytona Beach, with
instructional sessions for players ranging in age from youth football to top
high school prospects. In addition to the practices, games will be played at
Municipal Stadium.

Jacob attended the one-week New England regional camp at Bryant College in
Smithfield, R.I, on the urging of Jeff Norton, a Pepperell Pop Warner coach.

"Jacob is a hard-working kid who really loves football," Norton said. "He
strives to be the best he can. The (Offense-Defense) camp is, in my opinion, of
the nation's top camps."

The Offense-Defense camps have seen their share of notable players over the
years, with NFL stars Cam Newton, Dez Bryant, and Earl Thomas among the former
participants.

"I wasn't aware of the camp before, but they've been around for a while," said
Scott Scholefield, Jacob's father. "He did great at the camp. He works hard.
They named him MVP of his group and gave him the invite.

"It's pretty exciting."

Scott Scholefield says his son has been playing since he was seven or eight and
in addition to excelling at fullback and linebacker, is also a lacrosse
goaltender. The younger Scholefield says he enjoys playing a physical game and
hopes to play at Bishop Guertin High School in Nashua.

But for now, the player known lovingly as "Beef" to teammates is looking forward
to a chance to work with some of the best players in the country. And his family
is anxious to see him do it.

"It's a huge honor for him. We're really proud of what he's been able to do,"
Scott Scholefield said.

The Trib Big Ten breakouts

BYLINE: Sam Ross Jr.

LENGTH: 613 words


5 Games to Watch

OHIO STATE VS. WISCONSIN

OCT. 4, Camp Randall Stadium

The early thinking is this one could prove decisive in the Big Ten title chase

PENN STATE VS. WISCONSIN

OCT. 11, Camp Randall Stadium

Penn State has to prove it can win big games on the road and could be catching
the Badgers at a good time.

MICHIGAN VS. PENN STATE

OCT. 18, Beaver Stadium

The Nittany Lions are searching for their first win over Michigan since 1996.

OHIO STATE VS. ILLINOIS

Nov. 15, Memorial Stadium

Ohio State will be looking to avenge last year's upset loss to the Illini in the
Buckeyes' home Horseshoe.

MICHIGAN VS. OHIO STATE

Nov. 22, Ohio Stadium

It's the conference's greatest rivalry, but by this time, Michigan might be
giving thanks the season is all but over and Ohio State could be pointing toward
another BCS title game.

5 Players to Watch

CHRIS WELLS

Ohio State, Jr., RB, 6-foot-1, 237 pounds

The sizeable tailback combines speed and power. Wells rushed for 1,609 yards
last year, including 146 in the Buckeyes' BCS title game loss to LSU.

JAMES LAURINAITIS

Ohio State, Sr., LB, 6-3, 240

Already in his highly decorated career, Laurinaitis has won the Butkus Award
(2007) and Nagurski Award (2006) and been a multiple-season all-america pick.
His unfinished business is a national championship.

C.J. BACHER

Northwestern, Sr., QB, 6-2, 210

Bacher led the Big Ten in passing (304.7 yards) and total offense (307.2) per
game last year as a junior.

CURTIS PAINTER

Purdue, Sr., QB, 6-4, 230

Painter led the Big Ten with 29 touchdown passes in 2007 and was second to
Bacher among conference quarterbacks in passing and total offense per game

KELLEN LEWIS

SCOUTING REPORT

Offensive strength: Despite losing All-SEC flanker Andre Hastings, Georgia could
still have the SEC's deepest receiving corps. The Bulldogs have at least six
solid wideouts, and Shannon Mitchell is the SEC's best tight end.

Offensive weakness: Air Georgia will have a hard time getting off the ground if
it doesn't replace the Jack and Mack Show. Center Jack Swan and running back
Mack Strong were two of the SEC's most underrated players and critical to
Georgia's success the past two seasons. Both positions remain big uncertainties,
especially running back, which has been injury-riddled during the preseason.

Defensive strength: All-SEC outside linebacker Mitch Davis says Georgia has the
nation's best linebacking corps. He might be right. Davis is a solid All-America
candidate. So is sophomore Randall Godfrey. Keep an eye on freshman Marcus
Williams.

Defensive weakness: Just when it looked like Georgia had finally solved its
problems on the defensive front, top two nose guards Travis Jones and Deshay
McKever go down and highly touted junior college All- America tackle Matt Storm
has a less-than-impressive preseason.

Keys to success: Somebody has to step up in the middle of both lines. Ditto for
Frank Harvey at running back. Terrell Davis also needs to get some help at
scatback.

Sure sign of trouble: Besides Steve Spurrier in the rear-view mirror? If
quarterback Eric Zeier goes down, forget it. Without Zeier, Georgia would be
hard-pressed to beat anyone on its schedule. Even with him, the Bulldogs might
not have enough to silence Spurrier and Florida.

The Gators' Defense Continues to Pick Up the Offense

BYLINE: By RAY GLIER

DATELINE: JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Oct. 28


Trumpets seemed to blare when Urban Meyer was named the head coach at the
University of Florida, bringing his spread offense from Utah. Many Gators fans
figured it would not be long before he shared a pedestal with Steve Spurrier,
the former Florida coach who revolutionized the run-oriented Southeastern
Conference in the 1990s with a pass-happy offense known as fun-and-gun.

But now, two seasons into Meyer's tenure, Florida's identity is not in its
spread offense, but in its spread of talent on defense.

As they have done most of this season, the ninth-ranked Gators (7-1, 5-1 SEC)
bumbled along on offense, with dropped passes, missed field goals and a rash of
penalties and turnovers. Florida's defense was sturdy as usual, and saved a
21-14 victory over the Georgia Bulldogs (6-3, 3-3) before a crowd of 84,572 at
Alltell Stadium.

''Without them,'' Florida wide receiver Andre Caldwell said of the Gators'
defense, ''it would be a long season.''

Florida held Georgia to 64 yards rushing and 215 total yards. The Bulldogs,
playing behind the freshman quarterback Matthew Stafford, committed five
turnovers; they were pressured by a fast and fierce Florida front seven, led by
defensive ends Ray McDonald and Jarvis Moss and linebackers Brandon Siler and
Earl Everett.

On the first play from scrimmage in the third quarter, McDonald scored on a
9-yard fumble recovery to put Florida ahead, 21-0.

The Gators' offense almost gave the game right back with an interception and a
fumble that the Bulldogs turned into touchdowns to make the score 21-14 with 8
minutes 17 seconds to play.

Kregg Lumpkin's 8-yard touchdown run for Georgia cut the deficit to 7 points. It
was the first touchdown the Gators have given up in the fourth quarter this
season, and only the third rushing touchdown.

But when Georgia got the ball back with 4:53 to play and a chance to tie, it was
forced to punt after three plays. Florida ran out the clock for its 15th victory
in the last 17 games against the Bulldogs in this longtime rivalry.

The Gators are in command of the SEC East and have games remaining with South
Carolina and Vanderbilt. With Southern California's loss to Oregon State on
Saturday, the Gators are still in the chase for the national championship, but
their problems on offense make them unlikely contenders for the title.

''We have issues,'' Meyer said. ''There are a variety of things we need to get
cleaned up.''

Quarterback Chris Leak completed 14 of 28 passes and threw a touchdown pass and
an interception. His numbers could have been better, but his receivers dropped
four passes in the first half.

The Gators, who have had injuries at tailback, managed 156 yards rushing by six
backs.

It is not only the players on the Florida offense who are struggling. The
offense's setup looks wobbly, with illegal-substitution penalties continuing
into Meyer's second season.

Coming in, the Gators were the most penalized team among 119 N.C.A.A. Division
I-A teams (9.14 a game), and they added 10 penalties for 75 yards Saturday.
Meyer seemed to dismiss national championship speculation in the postgame news
conference by saying, ''You saw the offense I saw.''

One player who did not have an off day on offense was Caldwell, who scored on a
12-yard run in the first quarter to put the Gators ahead, 7-0. He then hooked up
with Leak on a 40-yard touchdown pass in the second quarter to make the score
14-0.

Under relentless pressure, Stafford completed only 13 of 33 passes for 151
yards, and he threw two interceptions.

''They are a great defensive unit that sometimes gets overshadowed because of
their offense,'' Stafford said.

That might have been the case earlier this season. Not anymore.

Jay Paterno upbeat despite criticism directed at PSU offense

BYLINE: Sam Ross Jr.

LENGTH: 583 words


Jay Paterno, son of Penn State football coach Joe Paterno, remains remarkably
affable.

This, despite becoming the lightning rod of criticism for an offense that
finished 11th in the Big Ten in total offense, passing offense and red-zone
offense, and 10th in rushing offense.

It could be said that Jay, the quarterbacks coach, suffers from poor timing. He
began working with the quarterbacks in 2000, and the team has endured four
losing seasons in the five years since. Last year, the Nittany Lions compiled a
4-7 record.

The critics see Jay's hand in all of this. They charge that his role in
play-calling drags down the effectiveness of offensive coordinator Galen Hall.

On this day, Jay pleads not guilty on the matter.

"I think more has been made out of it than there really is there," Paterno said.
"People say 'Well, you're not very good offensively, so it must be the
play-calling.' Some of it is."

A lot of it, he argues is not. And, on the matter of friction between Hall and
himself, Jay said that's not the case.

"Galen and I are comfortable with each other. He has no problems with me. I have
no problems with him," Paterno said, an assessment Hall had made in the past,
although Hall was not readily available at the team's preseason media day this
year.

Jay Paterno, however, held court near a doorway to the cavernous Holuba Hall
indoor practice facility.

Hall had worked from the sideline, with Jay Paterno upstairs in a booth, until
the Ohio State game late last October. Then Hall moved upstairs. That is where
Joe Paterno said in the spring that Hall likely would remain this season.

"I think one of the (advantages) about having him up in the box and having
another year of experience with each other, he'll say 'We ought to run that' and
it's getting to the point where I'm starting to (say), 'Oh, yeah,' finishing
each other's sentences," Jay said. "It's not like we're a married couple or
anything. I don't want it to sound like that. He's a little too old for me
anyway."

Why this rapport didn't produce better results last year could be attributed, at
least in part, to an inconsistent offensive line, unproductive wide receivers,
and nagging injury problems of quarterbacks Zack Mills and Michael Robinson.

Robinson, who returns as the starter this season, is taking hope from the
back-to-back Nittany Lions wins against Indiana and Michigan State at the end of
the 2004 campaign.

"The play-calling was a lot smoother the last couple of games and we won,"
Robinson said. "Whatever system that was those last couple games, hopefully
we'll carry that into this season. And hopefully the success will be there,
too."

The system, according to Jay, is one of free input.

"(Hall) will say what he wants. He'll say, 'Hey, let's throw it' or 'Let's run
it.' Between the series is when most of the conversation occurs. He'll say 'Hey,
Dick (Anderson), what runs do you think will look good? 'Bill (Kenney) what do
you think? Mike (McQueary)? Anything you guys see down there?' "

Anderson and Kenney are line coaches, and McQueary coaches the receivers.

"There are times when a play breaks down and it's not the right call and a guy
makes a catch and makes somebody miss and all of a sudden you're, 'Hey, that's a
great play call,' " Jay said.

But Penn State's general lack of offensive success is a continuing source of
irritation to the team's fans. Jay offered encouragement.

"I think people are going to be happy," he said, "that we'll make some
improvement this year offensively."

ACC INSIDER / Hall happy Wolfpack opening things up / West Coast offense
specialist Trestman will bring new look to N.C. State

BYLINE: Andrew Jones, Star-News Correspondent

SECTION: Sports; Pg. 1C, 4C

LENGTH: 608 words


HOT SPRINGS, VA.  | Tramain Hall is excited about North Carolina State's new
offense. In fact, he's downright exhilarated.

"Absolutely. Big time. You better believe it. No doubt about it," Hall said when
asked about the Wolfpack's new West Coast offense Sunday at the ACC Football
Weekend Kickoff at The Homestead in the Allegheny Mountains.

Hall should be excited. The senior speedster followed a 69-catch sophomore
campaign with only 28 receptions for 324 yards and a meager three touchdowns for
the 5-6 Wolfpack last fall.

He attributes the statistical slide to several things, but mostly to the overall
offensive struggles of the team, which began with inconsistency at quarterback,
a result of mediocre blocking and route running.

"Not to sound selfish about it, but everybody says, 'Hey man, why didn't you get
the ball much?' But hey, sometimes the quarterback doesn't get the ball off.
That's how bad we were hurting."

State suffered a series of injuries along the offensive line, affecting its
chemistry and exacerbating quarterback Jay Davis' struggles. But now the
Wolfpack ushers in a new approach to moving the ball under first-year offensive
coordinator Marc Trestman, who comes to Raleigh after serving as the assistant
head coach/quarterbacks coach for the Miami Dolphins.

In the 1995-96 seasons, Trestman learned the nuances of the West Coast offense
as the offensive coordinator of the San Francisco 49ers. He has since tweaked
his version of the system at stops that included a stint as offensive
coordinator for the Oakland Raiders in 2002-03.

Trestman hasn't coached in college since he was at the University of Miami in
1984, where he won a national championship in 1983. But he's been to the NFL
playoffs 15 times as an assistant, and that also has Hall's juices flowing.

"Coach Trestman knows what he's doing," Hall said, wearing a big smile. "He has
seen so much in this game and he instills confidence in us. This offense is
perfect for us. It's going to be fun."

Provided he stays healthy, Hall can't help but enjoy this season. He experienced
some physical ailments last year and rumors swirled he wasn't in the greatest of
graces with the coaches. But all is apparently well and the new system has given
a beleaguered offense a new lease on life.

In operating the West Coast offense, the Wolfpack will use a short passing game
to control tempo. It also sets up misdirection running plays and deep passes.
But it requires precision, and timing is essential to it functioning properly.

Davis had more success throwing short passes than deep balls last year, which
Hall says makes it the "perfect offense for him." He also says the quarterback's
decision-making has significantly improved.

And with Hall sometimes lining up as a halfback, opportunities to make an impact
should increase, especially catching quick passes on three-step drops by the
quarterback. He believes the new offense means better personal numbers.

"I can assure you of one thing," he said, "You will hear a lot of me this
season. I will catch a lot of passes, get a lot of touches."

Hall has made a believer of N.C. State linebacker Oliver Hoyte. Having gone
against the new offense in spring practice and being keenly aware of the
Deerfield Beach, Fla., native's seemingly limitless skills, Hoyte too has
visions of a big year from the 5-foot-10, 190-pound Hall.

"Oh man, I'll tell you what," Hoyte said, running his hand over his mouth as if
to suppress his excitement. "Tramain is going to have a big, big year. He was
built for this offense."

And Hall can't wait.

HEREABOUTS Rape, murder shatter Gulf Coast's peace

BYLINE: By Rheta Grimsley Johnson

SECTION: NATIONAL NEWS; Section A; Page 3

LENGTH: 498 words


Pass Christian, Miss. - One cool night about a week ago, two Slidell, La., high
school sweethearts were strolling the beach. Beyond them, red and jade channel
markers pocked the blackness of the Mississippi Sound, a sight hypnotic and
beautiful.

There is a broad and snowy strip of sand here, a local point of pride. The lacy
skirt of water and the constant ocean breeze are tonics. On any nice day or
night people use the beach, an elongated park for jogging or walking or sitting.
This is not a lonely stretch. It is a popular one.

The young Louisiana couple lingered on a pier to talk or kiss or admire the
stars, as lovers have for decades.

But then a man boiled out of the darkness and hit Tom Giroir Jr., 17, on the
head with an iron pipe. He died the next day.

The assailant raped the girl, who is 18. He stole the girl's purse. It held no
money.

This kind of thing wouldn't shock nearby New Orleans. Disturb, yes. Shock, no.
In New Orleans last year, the district attorney was mugged on his way to a
French Quarter party.

But the murder and rape rocked peaceful, genteel Pass Christian, which bills
itself as the birthplace of yachting in the South. The most serious offenders
here get hauled before the city Tree Board for unauthorized cutting of live oaks
and magnolias. The last murder was in 1989.

People are talking, theorizing, locking their doors. Police are hunting the
murderer. And I am wondering why and how things have come to this.

The first thing law-abiding Americans conceded were cities. We avoided certain
parts of them, moved away from them, acted cautiously in them. If crime had a
domain, it was the city. A lot of us said we would never live in one.

But then, marching like fire ants or killer bees, crime spread outward to the
towns. Tupelo and Topeka and points in between began reading murder and rape in
their headlines.

Rural crime grew faster than the crops. When Truman Capote wrote about the
murder of the Clutter farm family in the wheat plains of western Kansas in 1965,
it was a shocking tale. Now I'm not so sure it would be. Garden variety murder
in cold blood is no longer unusual enough to make the best-seller list.

Other places have been dealing with violent crime for so long that I may sound
silly and selfish. But the Mississippi beach was like a well- kept secret, a
home-free zone where you could walk alone at night and look at the stars, not
over your shoulder.

A man with an iron pipe and no morals ended Tom Giroir's promising life and the
false belief that there was a safe place left in this country to walk and enjoy
nature and mind your own business.

Crime has arrived in this sleepy shrimping town that prides itself on its old
trees and big azaleas and the ability of its wildly diverse citizens to get
along. Rape and murder here means there's no place left.

News Service. Hereabouts will appear occasionally on this page.

Broncos Bear Offensive Gifts; Ravens' Flinty Defense Will Aim to Curb Run In AFC
Playoff Game

Kathy Orton , Special to The Washington Post

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. D03

LENGTH: 873 words

DATELINE: OWINGS MILLS, Md., Dec. 26


Baltimore Ravens Coach Brian Billick knows a strong offense when he sees it. He
was, after all, the architect of the highest-scoring offense in NFL history--the
1998 Minnesota Vikings.

Even Billick is impressed by the Denver Broncos' attack. Now the coach needs to
show defensive prowess to scheme against it for Sunday's AFC first-round game at
PSINet Stadium (12:30 p.m., CBS). Denver has the league's No. 2 rushing game,
No. 3 passing game and the league's second-ranked offense overall. Minnesota is
the only other team to have both its run offense and pass offense ranked among
the top 10 in the league.

When the Broncos (11-5) come to Baltimore, one of the featured matchups will be
Denver's offense against Baltimore's record-breaking defense. The Ravens (12-4)
broke the 1986 Chicago Bears' record for fewest points allowed in a 16-game
regular season, holding their opponents to 165 points.

"This is the best offense in the league right now," Billick said. "With all due
respect to St. Louis and Minnesota, this is the best in my opinion."

Billick and the coaching staff began preparing for Denver long before Tennessee
clinched the AFC Central Division title on Monday night by beating Dallas, 31-0.
As the playoff scenarios began to develop over the last few weeks, the staff put
together game films on the Broncos and other teams for the coaches to break
down. Billick took a peek at some of that film, but he and the coaches didn't
begin their playoff preparations in earnest until Christmas night. After
celebrating Christmas with their families, the coaches worked late into the
night devising strategy for the first postseason game in Ravens history.

"Denver's going to move the ball," Billick said. "An offense of that capability,
you're not going to shut them down. They're going to make some plays. . . .
We'll begin with trying to limit them from rushing the ball as we've done with
everybody. Certainly we're going to have to prevent them from making plays down
the field."

Denver heads into the playoffs unsure who its quarterback will be. Starter Brian
Griese, the NFL's top-rated quarterback, aggravated a shoulder injury Saturday
in the Broncos' 38-9 win against San Francisco. Griese separated his throwing
shoulder Nov. 13 and missed five games, with former Washington Redskins
quarterback Gus Frerotte leading Denver to a 4-1 mark in his absence.

"Both these quarterbacks have similar properties about them," Billick said. "So
no matter who's in, they're kind of doing the same things so whichever one plays
will play and we'll prepare the same way."

Billick gave the players Monday and today off. They will return to practice
Wednesday. Since Baltimore plays Sunday, the Ravens have their usual preparation
time for a game.

"It allows us to keep on a normal routine, particularly with the Christmas day
in there," Billick said. "We'll cut practice down a little bit, just because
we're at that point in the season."

Even with limited practices, Baltimore's offense will receive a lot of attention
this week. The Ravens had just 142 yards total offense against the New York Jets
on Sunday in their 34-20 win.

"We're going to have to do better offensively," Billick said. "There's no
question about that. And that's what we'll focus on this week getting done."

Ravens Notes: Backup quarterback Tony Banks's shoulder is better than expected
and the Ravens are hopeful he will be ready to play. Banks separated his left
(non-throwing) shoulder on Baltimore's third play of the second half against the
Jets. Initially, he was expected to miss one to three weeks.

"He will be limited [in Wednesday's practice], but it looks like we can get him
some reps on Thursday and Friday," Billick said. "He's optimistic that he will
be able to be the number two [quarterback]. We'll see as the week goes and see
how he can actually go with it."

Banks took over in the game when starter Trent Dilfer injured his left
(non-throwing) wrist. Billick said Dilfer will have no problem playing Sunday.
Should Dilfer and Banks be unavailable, Billick said rookie Chris Redman will
play.

"It would be a great opportunity for him under some real interesting
circumstances," Billick said. "It would be too late for us to bring in a third
guy. . . . If Chris needed to be the number two, he's been around all year long.
He'll have to step up and do that." . . .

Baltimore's defense may have set the record for fewest points allowed, but it's
now not even the top overall defense in the league. The Ravens' defense fell to
No. 2 overall (behind Tennessee) after yielding 524 yards total offense to the
Jets on Sunday. Baltimore still has the NFL's top run defense. . . .

Last week during a team meeting, Billick had the players who have been in the
playoffs stand. The Ravens have 22 players on their roster who have played on a
playoff team during their career, including tight end Shannon Sharpe and right
tackle Harry Swayne--both of whom won Super Bowls while with Denver in 1997 and
'98.

"Look, here's your resource," Billick told those players not standing. "If
you're sitting down, look at one of the guys standing up, buddy up with him and
kind of watch how this works."

These young 'Cats can score;
But Kentucky coach cites offense's inexperience after 51-32 win.

BYLINE: Michael DiRocco, The Times-Union

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. C-1

GAINESVILLE -- As far as improvements go, it couldn't get much better than it
did for Kentucky last weekend.

After being shut out 28-0 by Louisville in the season opener, the Wildcats
scored 52 points in 19-point win over Indiana. Even though quarterback Shane
Boyd's stats mirrored that upgrade, it wasn't Boyd's fault for the offense's
sluggish start.

Kentucky coach Rich Brooks said Boyd had a complete grasp of Ron Hudson's
multiple offense before the season began, but poor execution is what hurt the
Wildcats.

"He's had it figured out," Brooks said of the offense that Hudson used at Kansas
State for passer-runners Michael Bishop and El Roberson. "What we haven't had
around him is the execution to make things work.

"We're inexperienced in the offensive line. We were inexperienced in the
Louisville game and we were even more inexperienced in the Indiana game. We're a
very inexperienced offensive team."

OK, we get the point. Inexperienced. But how, exactly?

Kentucky played nine freshman against the Hoosiers, and three made their first
career starts: running back Tony Dixon, wide receiver Lonnell Dewalt and left
tackle Aaron Miller. Plus, true freshman Micah Jones played significantly.

Those young players came up big, too. Dixon rushed for 105 yards, Dewalt caught
three passes and blocked a field goal, and freshman free safety Marcus McClinton
ran for a first down on a fake punt.

The linemen helped the Wildcats rush for 355 yards and four touchdowns. Kentucky
had only 66 yards rushing against Louisville.

"It doesn't take a genius to see that we have more difference-makers than some
of the previous recruiting classes," Brooks said as the Wildcats (1-1, 0-0 SEC)
prepared for today's matchup against No. 16 Florida (1-1, 0-1 SEC) at Florida
Field. "The good news is these young players have some pretty good talent, and
when they mature these guys are going to be pretty good players in this league."

Boyd in particular looked like one last Saturday, although he's not young. The
redshirt senior had a horrible 2004 debut, rushing for 17 yards and completing
14-of-34 passes for 172 yards and two interceptions against Louisville, but had
a career day against Indiana. Boyd rushed for 130 yards and two touchdowns on 17
carries and completed 21-of-30 passes for 205 and two touchdowns with no
interceptions.

It was the first time the Wildcats have been able to take advantage of Hudson's
offense. Hudson came to Lexington before last season after eight years at Kansas
State, but he wasn't able to fully utilize his offense because of the limited
mobility of 300-pound quarterback Jared Lorenzen.

Lorenzen moved well in the pocket, but he wasn't the running threat that Boyd
is. Boyd, though, didn't have a full understanding of the offense last season
either, and completed just 15-of-43 passes for 205 yards, two touchdowns, and
two interceptions. He did rush for 268 yards and four touchdowns, and also
played as a wide receiver, running back and part of the punt coverage unit.

Against Indiana, the way Boyd ran the offense was reminiscent of how Bishop and
Roberson did it under Hudson at Kansas State. Boyd ran when he should have,
completed quick passes, and kept the Hoosiers off balance by mixing up the snap
count, calling audibles, and milking the play clock.

"Shane Boyd will bring a different dimension to the offense than what Kentucky
has had in the last four years with Jared," Brooks said. "Some of the things he
can bring to the offense should open up other things for the offense because we
won't be quite as predictable about where we are throwing the ball from."

There is one thing predictable about Kentucky's offense for Florida, though.
Stopping Boyd.

"He's their offense," UF defensive coordinator Charlie Strong said. "As he goes,
that offense goes."

Even with the questions at quarterback, success tonight ...;
IS ALL ABOUT THE 'D';
A talented, veteran quarterback; sounds like a blueprint that has given OSU
problems before

DATELINE: TROY, Ala.


TROY, Ala. - Set aside the drama on who Oklahoma State starts at quarterback for
just a moment.

The Cowboys probably would score a ton of points if redshirt freshman Alex Cate
were under center. Troy's defense is that bad (503.5 yards and 52.5 points a
game). The Trojans' special teams are abysmal.

The key to tonight's game - the key to the whole season - is how well OSU's
defense plays. This is a Troy offense that has a mobile, explosive quarterback
and quality wide receivers who will test defensive coordinator Tim Beckman's
troops.

The last thing OSU wants is to get involved in a shootout at Movie Gallery
Veterans Stadium. That blueprint resulted in losses to Houston last year and
Louisiana Tech five years ago.

In both games OSU couldn't contain offenses led by talented, veteran
quarterbacks.

Five years ago in Shreveport, La., OSU built an 18-point lead against La. Tech
but left frustrated after Luke McCown threw for 448 yards to rally the Bulldogs
to a 39-36 win.

Last year at Houston, Kevin Kolb threw for 313 yards and four touchdowns. The
Cougars compiled 509 total yards to win 34-25.

McCown is Tampa Bay's backup quarterback. Kolb, a second-round pick,  is the
Philadelphia Eagles' backup quarterback.

Troy's Omar Haugabook probably won't make an NFL roster. But the reigning Sun
Belt Player of the Year is a mobile Arena League-type quarterback the Cowboys
often have struggled against.

Even though the Trojans are the defending Sun Belt champions, it's a game OSU
should win. But if it's a shootout, ala Houston or La. Tech, it could get dicey.

Beckman's goal every game is to limit opponents to 17 points or fewer. Troy has
averaged 28.5 points in losses to Florida and Arkansas. If the Cowboys limit the
Trojans to 24 or less they probably win.

"They scored 31 on Florida and 26 against Arkansas," Beckman said. "They're an
explosive offense that tries to keep you off-balance. They spread it out and
move the ball around."

Troy's offense isn't identical but is similar to Larry Fedora's offense, the
offense the Cowboys see every day in practice.

Troy, though, relies more on its passing game with low-risk, one-on-one matchups
to running backs and receivers, similar to Houston's offense.

"Their quarterback does a great job," Beckman said. "He's strong and mobile. You
have to try and keep him in check. We made strides last week. The key is we
can't give up big plays and we have to tackle well."

The overriding question this offseason: Will OSU's defense improve under
Beckman? The final answer arrives in November, but tonight's nationally
televised game will provide early season insight.

New look was planned all along;
The Falcons were overhauling their offense this offseason, with or without their
star QB.

BYLINE: Mark Craig, Staff Writer

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 1C

LENGTH: 777 words


The sad saga of Michael Vick's fall from NFL icon to societal outcast has
unfolded for several months through many different venues. Except, of course, a
football field, where the Atlanta Falcons ultimately will discover just how
rough the post-Vick era will be, if it's rough at all.

New coach Bobby Petrino, the up-tempo offensive mind behind the University of
Louisville's rise to national prominence, and quarterback Joey Harrington,
Vick's replacement, have worked quietly on a potentially exciting new spread
offense that could transform the run-oriented Falcons and maybe - just maybe -
give them a chance to succeed against all odds. Meanwhile, Vick, even in his
absence, has overshadowed their every move.

Vick's story began in April when sordid details of dogfighting emerged from his
Surry County, Va., property. It continued into a Richmond, Va., federal
courthouse, where Vick pleaded guilty to a felony; and on to New York City,
where NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell suspended Vick indefinitely as he awaits
sentencing Dec. 10.

Falcons offense an unknown

The next chapter - Life after Michael - begins Sunday at the Metrodome. The
Vikings are three-point favorites in the season opener, although the outcome is
anybody's guess. Especially since no one at Winter Park knows exactly what
Petrino and his offensive staff concocted this offseason when they built what
they believe is a unique playbook using bits and pieces from each of their
backgrounds.

"Even when the coach you're facing has been there and is established, the first
three games of every season are difficult to prepare for because teams change so
much," Vikings linebacker Ben Leber said. "But this situation is extremely
difficult because we really have nothing to go off of. I guess you could say we
have his preseason film, but everybody knows the preseason is just a bunch of
vanilla plays that don't mean anything."

Petrino, 46, has only three years of NFL coaching experience, as Jacksonville's
quarterbacks coach in 1999 and 2000 and its offensive coordinator in 2001. The
other 21 years of his career were spent in the college ranks at places that love
to spread the field and wing it.

"Bobby Petrino is a very creative guy," Vikings coach Brad Childress said. "I
expect them to throw us some curveballs. I expect them to roll personnel. I
expect them to be no-huddle. I expect them to be four wide, five wide. You
understand where he came from in the Big Sky Conference [at Idaho, Weber State
and Utah State]. There's a lot of 51-49 games out there."

Comparable to Louisville?

As Louisville coach the past four seasons, Petrino created what was called a
power spread formation. Using multiple receivers, good balance and a
quick-strike passing attack, the Cardinals ranked second in total offense (475.3
yards per game) while going 12-1 and finishing ranked No. 6 in the country by
the Associated Press last season.

Childress said the Vikings have to be "well-versed" in Louisville's offense.
Meanwhile, Harrington downplayed the Louisville connection but did say it's an
Atlanta offense that puts a lot of control into  the hands and mind of the
quarterback.

"It's the type of offense where you need to be able to think; you need to be on
your toes, to recognize what's going on," said Harrington, who beat the Vikings
for the first time in seven tries while running the Dolphins spread offense last
season. "Those are the things I do well. I've never been a guy who is a great
improvisor. The things I do well are I study, I can recognize things, and I can
read a situation."

Harrington, who is 23-43 as a starter since the Lions drafted him No. 3 overall
in 2002, said he's done putting undue pressure on himself. And that means not
worrying about being Vick's successor.

"I'm not trying to step in and fill Michael's shoes," Harrington said. "I'm not
trying to be Michael. I'm not going to replace Mike. ... I'm not trying to be
somebody else and try to make the team forget about Mike. That's not my job."

`We're not talking about it'

Petrino has handled the Vick situation well. He was calm when asked a few
questions about Vick during a conference call with the Twin Cities media
Wednesday. He said the team is not distracted and is ready to move on, thanks to
the leadership of several veterans.

However, Petrino finally cracked with about two minutes left in the 12-minute
conference call when one final question about Vick was asked.

"You know, it's time to drop Michael Vick questions," he said. "I'm sorry, but
we've answered enough of them. I've told you what we've tried to do here. And
we're not talking about it anymore."

Sounds like it's time for Life after Michael to begin.

Pressuring Willie is focus of Y. strategy

BYLINE: Dick Harmon Deseret News

LENGTH: 710 words


LAS VEGAS -- Willie Tuitama poised. Willie Tuitama rattled.

Those states of mind of Arizona's fifth-year senior quarterback are a huge part
of BYU's defensive game plan this week in preparing for its fourth-straight Las
Vegas Bowl appearance in Sam Boyd Stadium on Saturday.

If the Cougars fail to make Tuitama uncomfortable, their secondary could pay a
price. If they apply pressure to Tuitama and get him to second-guess himself or
doubt what he does in delivering the football, BYU likes its chances.

"That's what it always comes down to with a quarterback," said corner Scott
Johnson.

But can BYU's defense -- one that has struggled to pressure quarterbacks like
Utah's Brandon Johnson, UNLV's Omar Clayton and CSU's Billy Farris -- get heat
on the Wildcat star?

"I think we can," said BYU defensive coordinator Jaime Hill. "We did before."

Last season, the Cougars had Kelly Poppinga and Bryan Kehl playing linebacker
which freed 2007 MWC sack leader Jan Jorgensen to make more plays from his
defensive end spot.

Still, Hill said he has pregame hopes, if the Cougars play their best.

"We'll have to bring our 'A' game," said senior linebacker David Nixon. "If we
don't, they have big play capability."

Nixon sees Arizona's offense as explosive, talented and good.

"Their offense is similar to the previous times we played them except now they
execute better," he said.

Arizona ranked third in the Pac-10 in passing offense behind Oregon State and
USC. The Wildcats were also third in scoring offense in the league, averaging
21.33 points per game.

In the Wildcats, the Cougars will face a spread offense and over the past
season, that kind of offense has given the Cougars fits.

Is this another dreaded spread?

"It's really not," said head coach Bronco Mendenhall. "The spread offense, so to
speak, misses one component and that's a running quarterback."

Tuitama isn't known to take off like Utah's Johnson or TCU's Andy Dalton.

Said Mendenhall, "If the quarterback isn't part of the run game then you are
running more of a conventional offense. Their offense is more similar to ours.
It doesn't mean they'll be easy to stop. They've been very productive."

How long has it been since the Cougars chased down quarterbacks?

They got a little heat in the third quarter on Utah's Johnson. They did pressure
AFA's freshman Tim Jefferson and they even got after Washington's Jake Locker a
few times and even forced a fumble.

So, can BYU's defense handle this important key to the game?

Oddsmakers here say no, the Cougar defense has too many warts. That in part, is
why the Cougars are three-point underdogs.

"Their passing game is similar to Utah except their check down is an out route
to the wide out," Nixon said. "You have to focus on that because they have great
team speed. We have a great scheme going in. They have a huge O-line and we have
to deal with that aspect."

Hill said his troops must get to Tuitama, but this version of the Wildcats is
more capable of hurting a defense with the run game.

"The thing about their offense is this: If you look at their offense in 2006 and
things they did with their run game and then take what they did in 2007 with
their pass game, they've combined the two in 2008.

"That makes them a better offense and team," Hill said.

UA scored nine rushing TDs last year and 31 this year.

"So they've been very consistent in running the ball," Hill said. "The offensive
coordinator (Sonny Dykes) wants to pass it; the head coach (Mike Stoops) wants
to run it. So they've kind of meshed the two together."

Like any defensive plan, the Cougars would like to render the Wildcats
one-dimensional on offense.

That gets back to Willie.

Can the Wildcat pass protection free Willie?

"He's very good.

He's extremely good when he's in a rhythm," Hill said.

"If he stays in rhythm, he's good. If he's out of rhythm and has to adjust his
feet; he's not as good."

Pressure? BYU's game plan? What's the capability of the Cougars' defense, which
at times, has struggled to make stops and force fourth downs?

"I feel very good about it," Hill said. "There's not a game we don't go into
that I don't feel good about it. Whatever happens, happens. We will play hard
and represent ourselves in a good manner."

But will the "good manner" be good enough? E-mail: dharmon@desnews.com

Rams fans crave offense

BYLINE:  Bernie Miklasz

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. B1

LENGTH: 1222 words


It's good to see Rams fans excited by their team. There have been big crowds at
the open practice sessions at Rams Park, with attendance up an estimated 70
percent from last summer.

I think we all know what this is about: offense.

Think about our town's NFL heritage. Almost every positive trend has flowed
through the offense. St. Louis NFL teams haven't won a lot of games over the
decades; there are many more losing seasons than I care to remember.

But when it's been good in St. Louis, an entertaining style of offense has led
the way. Rolling up yards and points with dynamic stars and innovative coaches.

In the 1960s, the St. Louis Cardinals scored more points than all but a few NFL
teams. The mid-1970s brought us coach Don Coryell and the "Air Coryell" attack,
featuring Jim Hart throwing passes to Mel Gray, the all-purpose electricity of
Terry Metcalf, the power running of Jim Otis, the Hall of Fame blocking of
offensive tackle Dan Dierdorf, and a Hall of Fame tight end in Jackie Smith.

From 1999 through 2001, the Mike Martz "Greatest Show on Turf" led the NFL in
scoring for three consecutive seasons, going crazy with an average of 32 points
a game. This special place in time starred Marshall Faulk, Kurt Warner, Isaac
Bruce, Torry Holt, Orlando Pace, Az Hakim, Ricky Proehl. That dashing cast won a
Super Bowl and two NFC championships.

Defense may win championships - or so it's been said - but offense entertains
the crowd and keeps the fans coming back for more.

In recent seasons the Rams experienced an excruciating drought on offense. Over
a six-season stretch of virtual futility - 2007 through 2012 - they scored the
fewest points in the NFL, averaging only 15.1 per game. The 2009 Rams wheezed to
an average of 10.9 points and put everyone to sleep.

So now there's a stirring at Rams Park. GM Les Snead and coach Jeff Fisher have
drafted or signed playmakers and bodyguards to put with quarterback Sam
Bradford. This offense is alarmingly low on experience, but no one cares much
about that. Because now the practice fields are filled with speedy, athletic
players who can put this offense in flight after years of lethargy.

This town loves offense, and the Rams are giving the people what they want. The
crowds obviously like what they're seeing.

Reading Time, Five Minutes

Our condolences to the family and friends of former St. Louis Browns catcher
Babe Martin, who died Thursday night in Tucson, Ariz., at age 93. Babe was a
pal, and a wonderful man. We enjoyed many entertaining baseball conversations
with him through the years. He played parts of six seasons with the Browns and
Boston Red Sox and at one point was a roommate of Hall of Famer Ted Williams.

It looks like the Cardinals' RISP beast has reawakened.

The Blues certainly aren't fooling around this summer, having reinvested
substantial dollars to maintain their core roster. There have been new deals for
defensemen Kevin Shattenkirk, Jordan Leopold and Jay Bouwmeester. New deals for
forwards Patrik Berglund and Chris Stewart. A new deal for goaltender Jake
Allen. A new deal for the recently acquired forward Magnus Paajarvi. And deals
for free-agent recruits Derek Roy and Maxim Lapierre.

And still to come: a new deal - and it will be a big one - for cornerstone
defenseman Alex Pietrangelo. The young Pietrangelo, a restricted free agent,
will command a huge contract, probably around $7 million a year. This one,
understandably, will take time to get done. And when Pietrangelo locks in, the
Blues will have their foundation set at defense set for several years.

The roster construction, based heavily on the blue line, will leave many
wondering if the Blues are putting enough money into their forwards. My opinion:
signing elite free-agent forwards is ungodly expensive, so the Blues must hope
that their current collection of young forwards - and prospects such as Dmitrij
Jaskin and Ty Rattie, who are close to making the leap to the NHL - will develop
into finishers. But as long as your team is strong in the back, it should be
highly competitive.

When Pietrangelo signs, the Blues will have 12 players under contract who will
be making at least $3 million a year. Another four will be paid at least $1
million annually. Blues owner Tom Stillman is spending like the ghost of Bill
Laurie. He's given GM Doug Armstrong the freedom to maintain a winning
structure, and that's important.

I think it's great that the Rams are bringing back former players, the latest
being retired safety Keith Lyle, to mingle with fans and sign autographs during
open practice sessions. This organization has had problems (obviously) in
building a winning team, but the Rams have been a fan-friendly franchise under
chief operating officer Kevin Demoff. ... I also appreciate head coach Jeff
Fisher's enthusiasm in bringing in former Rams - Bruce this week, Holt next week
- to work with the young, impressionable players.

Speaking of fan-friendly individuals: a very classy move by Chicago Blackhawks
forward Brandon Bollig to bring the Stanley Cup to his hometown, to share it
with young patients at the St. Louis Children's Hospital. I don't care that he
plays for the enemy Blackhawks; the St. Charles native is a good man.

Joe Kelly: 21 starts in two years for the Cardinals. A 3.28 ERA as a starter.
And he's allowed three earned runs or fewer in 18 of the 21 starts. How can he
not be in the rotation? ... Going into the weekend, Pete Kozma was rated the
10th-best shortstop defensively according to the Bill James metric of Defensive
Runs saved.

As the Cardinals resume their pursuit of the first-place Pirates, they'll have
to improve their record against winning teams. Entering the series at
Cincinnati, the Cardinals were 18-24 against teams that currently are .500 or
better. Counting Friday's contest, the Cardinals have 27 games remaining against
teams .500 or better: 10 vs. the Reds, nine with the Pirates, and four each with
the Dodgers and Braves. ... The Pirates have 21 games left against teams .500 or
better.

The Cardinals have to do better in close games; through Thursday they were 13-12
in one-run games, and 10-14 in games decided by two runs. ... I wouldn't dismiss
the possibility of catcher Tony Cruz being a positive factor offensively as the
fill-in for the injured Yadier Molina; in his last full season (2010) in the
minors Cruz batted .282 with a .352 onbase percentage and a .433 slugging
percentage, with 10 homers and 25 doubles.

With Sound Game Plan, Vikings Set to Make More Noise at Home

Leonard Shapiro, Washington Post Staff Writer

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. D03

LENGTH: 733 words

DATELINE: EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn., Jan. 11


The Minnesota Vikings are still waiting to play the perfect game, even if no
team in NFL history has scored more points in a single season, even after their
41-21 demolition of the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday that put them in the NFC
championship game for the first time since 1987.

They will take on the NFC West champion Atlanta Falcons here Sunday with a
decided home-field advantage at the Metrodome, one of the game's loudest indoor
arenas. The noise level against Arizona was deafening, clearly leading to a
half-dozen Cardinals penalties for false starts on offense and causing a
critical fumble on a center exchange when the snap count couldn't be heard.

It is hard to imagine the Vikings (16-1) operating any more efficiently than
they did against the overmatched Cardinals, who quickly found themselves
trailing 17-0 early in the second quarter, 24-7 at halftime and by 20 points
going into the fourth quarter.

Still, Minnesota Coach Dennis Green was not totally enamored with his team's
performance. His major concern centered on the Vikings' occasionally sloppy
tackling against a Cardinals team that managed only 74 yards rushing.

With the Falcons (15-2) swooping into town with running back Jamal Anderson in
tow, the Vikings are fully aware that a missed tackle here or there will
translate into a far more difficult game than what they encountered against the
Cardinals.

The Cardinals finished sixth in the NFL in rushing, averaging 131 yards a game.
Anderson gained 1,846 yards to lead the NFC, averaging 4.5 yards a carry, with
14 touchdowns, and also gained 319 more yards as a sure-handed receiver out of
the backfield.

Minnesota's defense has been overshadowed all season -- mostly because of the
team's high-voltage offense. But Green said today that "if teams focus on our
offense, they won't beat us.

"We've been fueled by our rapidly starting defense all year. It takes a team out
of their offense and lets us take control on offense. When you know you can stop
people early, you know you can be more aggressive early on offense."

The Vikings know full well an Atlanta offense run by veteran quarterback Chris
Chandler and revolving around Anderson's pounding runs presents an imposing
challenge.

"He's got real nifty feet," Minnesota defensive tackle Jerry Ball said. "He's
quick for a guy his size, and you try to single tackle him, you better bring all
your stuff. You need to gang tackle this guy.

"You look at his style and you know he's got great vision. He starts at the
point of attack, then he skips back to the hole once he sees the backers have
overrun the play. Our biggest concern will be to control the line from the
middle and force things to bounce so our guys with the nifty feet can make the
play."

The Vikings also were not totally satisfied with their offense, either.
Quarterback Randall Cunningham pointed to his ill-advised pass from the
Cardinals 7-yard line that turned into an interception, as well as cornerback
Jimmy Hitchcock's dropped interception with an open field in front of him.
Minnesota could easily have scored 55 points on a day Cunningham insisted his
offense wasn't operating at peak efficiency.

Still, the Vikings scored on seven of their 10 possessions, including a
run-out-the-clock series at the end of the game. They gained 416 yards,
including 188 on the ground when the Cardinals chose to focus on stopping the
big-play passing game.

The Vikings also threw some new wrinkles into their offensive game plan, both to
confuse the young Arizona defense and to send a warning to Atlanta. Why not give
the Falcons a little more to worry about in preparing for the most dangerous
offense in the game?

Three times in the first half, offensive coordinator Brian Billick lined up
all-purpose back David Palmer as a shotgun quarterback, splitting Cunningham out
wide to the left. On third-and-one and second-and-one situations, Palmer ran for
first downs. Another time, he rolled to his right and threw an incomplete pass.

"It's one more thing defenses have to prepare for," Billick said. "Every minute
they spend on that is a minute they can't spend on anything else. But it's
nothing we haven't used all year. It was simply an attempt to get the ball in
David Palmer's hands a few more times, that's all." Andrew Glover pointed the
Vikings in right direction with touchdown catch on Sunday.

ON PRO FOOTBALL;
As Offenses Ring Up Points, Cornerbacks Feel the Heat

BYLINE:  By Thomas George

SECTION: Section D; Column 1; Sports Desk; Pg. 4

LENGTH: 788 words


The backdrop for this year's National Football League playoffs includes a season
of offense that was remarkably rare.

We just saw the most points scored in N.F.L. history (11,097). The most
touchdowns (1,270). Quarterbacks have never completed a higher percentage of
passes (59.6). Toss in the fact that the 25 overtime games were the most ever,
and the menu for the playoffs includes a potent array of big plays and big
points mixed with tense action.

That means defensive backs in general and cornerbacks in particular will be on
high alert when the playoffs begin tomorrow. Danger lurks for every team in the
form of crushing, game-breaking pass plays, and the cornerbacks will figure
prominently.

"The N.F.L. wants points on the board, and it's an offensive game now," Atlanta
cornerback Ray Buchanan said in an interview this week. "And the more they get
what they want with rules changes that help offenses and with these offenses
gelling and attacking more fiercely, the more pressure falls on us. The value of
having prime cornerbacks in this league continues to increase. If you don't have
smart guys with great athletic ability playing cornerback, you aren't in the
playoffs right now."

And if your cornerbacks crumble, you will quickly exit the playoffs.

Buchanan knows. This is his first playoff appearance since Atlanta strode to the
Super Bowl four years ago and lost to the Denver Broncos. Buchanan and Ashley
Ambrose form Atlanta's cornerback duo that will battle the Green Bay Packers and
quarterback Brett Favre and his crew of receivers at Lambeau Field tomorrow
night.

It has been a strange season for Buchanan, 31, who is in his 10th pro season and
entered it with 27 interceptions over the last five years, the most by any
player.

He missed four games early in the season for violating the league's substance
abuse policy; he said he took an over-the-counter drug that contained a
substance banned by the league. Buchanan said he trained tirelessly during the
layoff and returned having dropped his weight to 183 pounds from 198 pounds. He
found that he was not only lighter but also quicker, faster, fresher and more
capable of covering fleet receivers.

But on Dec. 1 at Minnesota, Buchanan injured an abdominal muscle and played in
pain the last few weeks, even getting injections for the injury before kickoffs.

Finally, Buchanan said, he feels strong again.

He has 2 interceptions and 47 tackles this season and has been asked by the
Falcons' new defensive coordinator, Wade Phillips, to play in a tricky way, to
remain aggressive but take fewer solo chances that take him out of Atlanta's
team defensive concepts.

Buchanan has always been a dynamic, charismatic player who provides big plays
and energy. He said it was his job "to get things on a roll," and facing Favre
and receivers Donald Driver and Terry Glenn along with the rookie Javon Walker
will provide Buchanan with plenty of opportunities. His team's game plan will
include efficiently tackling the Green Bay receivers and using help from the
safeties to pound them on any catches over the middle.

Buchanan is a student and fan of the pro game. He knows what is unfolding around
him in the first round of the playoffs and offers some insights.

Jets cornerbacks Aaron Beasley and Donnie Abraham versus Indianapolis receiver
Marvin Harrison: "Harrison is not just another receiver. You have to play him
with no ego, double him and go man up on their other receivers."

Cleveland cornerbacks Corey Fuller and Daylon McCutcheon versus Pittsburgh
receivers Plaxico Burress and Hines Ward: "They've got their hands full. In this
situation you just do the best you can. Pittsburgh runs a lot of screens and can
nickel and dime you, and they have a lot of pick routes for their receivers.
Your best chance against those guys is a lot of third-and-long situations."

Giants cornerbacks Will Allen and Will Peterson versus San Francisco receiver
Terrell Owens: "Treat him like Marvin Harrison. Let the other guys beat you.
Even if the Giants' corners had success against him the first time they played
him early in the season, forget it. That ain't going to happen again."

There is not a position on the field in playoff football that requires more
courage than cornerback. Buchanan has prepared for Green Bay with extra film
study and by visualizing how the game and his coverage will be played. His goal,
he said, is to find at least a couple of key plays where he can be a force and
factor. And capitalize.

"Especially in the playoffs, cornerbacks have to have short-term memory,"
Buchanan said. "Things can fall apart with everybody watching, but you've got to
bounce back. And, I think most of all, you have to be aggressive; don't be
afraid to play to win."

'I will weep for Tupac,' says rapper's boyhood pastor;
Reports question whether Shakur was intended target

BYLINE: FROM OUR NEWS SERVICES

SECTION: NATIONAL NEWS; Pg. 12A

LENGTH: 511 words

DATELINE: New York


Tupac Shakur, remembered by many as a violent rapper who died in the "gangsta"
culture he glorified, was mourned at his boyhood church Sunday as the victim of
a society that destroys black youth.

"He had the genes, he had the ability. Could we have provided the society that
would have made him blossom?" the Rev. Herbert Daughtry said at House of the
Lord Pentecostal Church in Brooklyn.

Two days after the 25-year-old Shakur died of gunshot wounds suffered in a
drive-by shooting on a Las Vegas street, the pastor asked, "Who will weep for
Tupac Shakur?"

"I will weep for Tupac," he replied.

Though he left Brooklyn in his teens, Shakur still is listed as a member of the
congregation he joined when he was 15, with his mother and sister.

Other services for Shakur included a candlelight vigil Sunday in Atlanta's
Piedmont Park.

Shakur - who had served time for assault, weapons violations and sexual abuse -
was hit by four bullets Sept. 7 as he rode in a car driven by the head of his
record label, Death Row Records chief Marion "Suge" Knight.

Knight, who suffered minor injuries, and an entourage of at least 10 cars,
including bodyguards, have not provided any suspects.

Newsweek magazine, citing anonymous Los Angeles police, reported that the
shooting of three Crips gang members in Compton, Calif., last week was in
retaliation for the Shakur shooting. Other sources told the magazine that more
retribution was likely.

On Sunday, Los Angeles police disputed the Newsweek report. While they
acknowledged there was a triple shooting in Compton on Friday, they said the
motive was unknown. Officer Vince Aguirre, a department spokesman, said there
were no Shakur-related shootings "that we've heard about in L.A."

Despite the controversy and success of Shakur, Newsweek said music industry
sources believe Knight was the target.

"The best way to get Suge is to mess with his money," said a source close to
Death Row. "Tupac is his money."

CNN reported that Las Vegas police believe the gunmen were aiming for Shakur.

"Thirteen or 14 rounds were fired," Las Vegas police spokesman Phil Roland told
CNN. "We feel pretty sure that Shakur was the target."

In Brooklyn, Daughtry told about 150 people in the half-full church that
Shakur's self-proclaimed ambition to be "a revolutionary" against injustice to
blacks "was just as real as Martin's and Malcolm's," referring to Martin Luther
King Jr. and Malcolm X.

"I know that there are those who say he went about it the wrong way," Daughtry
added. "But it's not for me to judge."

The black activist preacher, who was Shakur's spiritual counselor for the past
decade, referred to the rapper's mother, who was pregnant when she was jailed as
a member of the militant Black Panther party.

Shakur, "a young man who lived a violent life," followed in his mother's
footsteps by trying to rebel against a racist society, Daughtry said.

Violence will flourish, the minister warned, as long as black communities
struggle against high unemployment, poor housing and drugs.

The sister of Green Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre was released on bond
from a Slidell, La., jail, accused of taking part in a drive-by shooting at a
motel. The arrest of Southern Mississippi student Brandi Favre, 19, comes nearly
three months after her brother, the NFL's most valuable player last season,
completed treatment for addiction to painkillers. Last month, their older
brother, Scott Favre, was arrested on a felony DUI charge after an accident that
killed a friend.

In Milwaukee, Ekaterina Gordeeva's solo competition debut didn't go as she and
everyone else so dearly wanted . Skating solo, Gordeeva slipped in both the
artistic and technical portions of the Northwestern Mutual Life World Team
Championship, which Europe won for the second straight year. It was her first
solo competition since her husband, Sergei Grinkov, died of a heart attack last
November. The meet pitted four teams of top internationally ranked skaters from
Canada, Europe, Russia and the United States. Gordeeva and Grinkov helped win
the inaugural event for Russia in 1994.

MOTORSPORTS

Angelle Seeling of Americus became the first woman in NHRA history to lead pro
stock motorcycle after a day of qualifying with a run of 7.535 seconds at 170.68

Pa. Kenny Bernstein was the first-day leader in top fuel with a track-record
time of 4.675 seconds at 297.81 mph; Cruz Pedregon led in funny cars (5.202 and
252.24) and Jim Yates led in pro stock (7.033 and 195.56). . . . A move by Damon
Hill to McLaren was ruled out when the team retained drivers David Coulthard and
Mika Hakkinen for the 1997 Formula One season. McLaren, which had previously
confirmed that Coulthard would stay with the team, said it decided to keep
Hakkinen after talks with engine suppliers Mercedes-Benz. Hill, who could clinch
the world title in the Portuguese Grand Prix next week, was left looking for a
team in 1997 after being dumped by Williams Renault. . . . Arie Luyendyk

Offensive change comes slowly at WVU

BYLINE: Josh Sickles

LENGTH: 512 words


MORGANTOWN, W.VA. -- Pitt's not the only Big East team to adapt its offense
midseason.

While West Virginia has put up excellent offensive numbers this season, coach
Dana Holgorsen has had to do things differently than in the past, as his players
continue learning his offense.

Though the offense has run slower than expected, the Mountaineers (7-3, 3-2 Big
East) still have had success.

"The biggest thing is finding out a way to win," Holgorsen said. "I don't care
where we're at offensively. It's about what we've got to do to win. We're not
happy with the three losses, but it's better than four."

There's little doubt West Virginia has improved offensively under Holgorsen.

Through 10 games, the Mountaineers have gained 4,794 yards, just 51 shy of their
13-game total last year. The offense also has scored more points (368) in 10
games than it did all of last season (327).

Quarterback Geno Smith has thrown for 3,497 yards, eclipsing his total from last
season, and he's 110 yards shy of the West Virginia's single-season record set
in 1998 by Central Catholic graduate Marc Bulger.

West Virginia ranks 13th nationally in total offense (479.4 ypg), sixth in
passing offense (362.1 ypg) and is tied for 16th in scoring offense (36.8 ppg).

Still, Holgorsen hasn't been able to use his full offensive arsenal, which
yielded a top-3 offense nationally each of the past three years.

The Mountaineers, despite being a no-huddle team, haven't used much a high-tempo
attack. Holgorsen has cut the playbook and changed how he's called plays to
accommodate West Virginia's personnel.

Pitt coach Todd Graham has done basically the same things this season. Graham's
slowed the tempo and slimmed the playbook to make quarterback Tino Sunseri's
decision-making quicker and easier.

"I know that coach Graham has the same philosophy as far as what he's done for
the last three years and what he's trying to put in," Holgorsen said. "He's
dealing with the same thing that I am as far as changing up what it used to be."

Holgorsen compared this West Virginia team to his first year at Texas Tech in
2000, when he helped Mike Leach turn the Red Raiders into a spread offense.

Offensive changes at Holgorsen's past two stops -- at Houston and Oklahoma State
-- went smoother because those schools had similar offensive principles and
personnel to handle the system.

But Texas Tech went through a complete change in philosophy, which took some
time to take hold.

In Holgorsen's first year at Texas Tech, the offense went from gaining 324.8 to
362.6 yards per game and from scoring 23.0 to 25.3 points per game. By
Holgorsen's last year, Texas Tech was averaging 529.62 yards of offense and
scoring 40.9 points per game, ranking second and seventh in the country,
respectively.

Holgorsen's confident West Virginia's offense will get there, but it will take
time.

"We'll keep trying to get better and keep trying to figure out how to put our
guys in position to win, which is ultimately the only thing that matters,"
Holgorsen said. "Things will get easier and easier the longer we're here."

Six teams, no real favorite in wide-open NFC

BYLINE: By Rick Alonzo ralonzo@pioneerpress.com

SECTION: SPORTS; Vikings

LENGTH: 1177 words


For most of the season, the Vikings and the New Orleans Saints were the elite
teams in the NFC. And that was the matchup that seemed most intriguing looking
ahead to the playoffs.

But the way December unfolded, with the Vikings and Saints slumping, suddenly
the NFC playoffs look wide open. All six NFC teams in the playoffs have at least
10 wins, and that means there isn't an obvious favorite.

The hottest team, Dallas, is the No. 3 seed and could have a tough time reaching
the Super Bowl. If the Cowboys beat Philadelphia on Saturday night, they would
play at Minnesota in the divisional round and then possibly travel to New
Orleans.

"I think it is always wide open," said Vikings coach Brad Childress, who knows
his team will play host to either Dallas, Green Bay or Arizona next week. "All
you have to do is look at the number of different division winners this year. We
did talk about it at the beginning of the year. We put down the evolution, if
you will, of the last four years. How many different playoff teams were there in
the last years? How many different champions? How many champions didn't make it
back? We're mindful of that."

Childress knows that anything can happen. This season, six teams qualified for
the playoffs that didn't play in the postseason last year. And five of the eight
divisions had new champions, with only Minnesota, San Diego and Arizona
repeating.

Vikings defensive tackle Pat Williams agreed that the playoffs are wide open.

"That's why we had to win that game Sunday going into the playoffs hot,"
Williams said. "Other teams, like the Saints, they lost the last three. So
they're thinking, 'We don't want no bye.' I think they want to play this week."

The Vikings gained momentum in their final two regular-season games, with a
30-point second half at Chicago, albeit in a loss, and a 44-7 win over the New
York Giants.

Here's a closer look at the teams in the NFC playoffs:

1. NEW ORLEANS SAINTS (13-3)

Can they still be considered the NFC favorite with a three-game losing streak
entering the playoffs? The defense has struggled against the run up the middle.

High point of the season: Many pundits were ready to hand the Saints a Super
Bowl ring after a 38-17 win over New England in Week 12.

Low point: A 20-17 overtime loss at home to Tampa Bay in Week 16

Longest win streak of the season: 13

Longest losing streak: 3

A look at the numbers (NFL rank): total offense (1), rushing offense (6),
passing offense (4), total defense (25), run defense (21), pass defense (26)

Strength: Quarterback Drew Brees (70.6 completion percentage, 34 TDs, 4,388
passing yards in 16 games)

Weakness: The defense has given up more than 400 yards in two of the past three
games.

2. VIKINGS (12-4)

Their weaknesses include inconsistent play on the offensive line and poor
tackling by the defense at times, but when Brett Favre is playing well and in
control of the offense, they're tough to beat.

High point of the season: A 10-1 record after a 36-10 win over Chicago in Week
12 drew comparisons to the 1998 Vikings.

Low point: The Vikings collapsed in an ugly 26-7 loss at Carolina in Week 15
when myriad weaknesses were exposed.

Longest win streak of the season: 6

Longest losing streak: 2

A look at the numbers (NFL rank): total offense (5), rushing offense (13),
passing offense (8), total defense (6), run defense (2), pass defense (19)

Strength: Favre's ability to command the offense and spread the ball around

Weakness: The Vikings must win the battles up front on the offensive and
defensive lines to win in the playoffs.

3. DALLAS COWBOYS (11-5)

The Cowboys have been criticized for poor Decembers, but now they're hot at the
right time. Going into the playoffs, the defense posted back-to-back shutouts
for the first time in franchise history.

High point of the season: A 24-0 win over Philadelphia in Week 17 made a big
statement.

Low point: A 20-17 loss at home to San Diego in Week 14 was their third loss in
five games.

Longest win streak of the season: 4

Longest losing streak: 2

A look at the numbers (NFL rank): total offense (2), rushing offense (7),
passing offense (6), total defense (9), run defense (4), pass defense (20)

Strength: Pass rusher DeMarcus Ware leads an aggressive defense that can stuff
the run and harass quarterbacks.

Weakness: The Cowboys haven't won a playoff game since 1996 when they defeated
Minnesota 40-15 in a wild-card game.

4. ARIZONA CARDINALS (10-6)

The Cardinals reached the Super Bowl last year but aren't getting much respect
this time around. Only time will tell whether they made a mistake by not going
full speed in Sunday's lopsided loss to Green Bay.

High point of the season: A 30-17 win over the Vikings in Week 13 stands out for
a team that played a weak schedule.

Low point: Seven turnovers in Week 14 during a 24-9 Monday night loss at San
Francisco en route to getting swept by the 49ers

Longest win streak of the season: 3

Longest losing streak: 1

A look at the numbers (NFL rank): total offense (14), rushing offense (28),
passing offense (12), total defense (20), run defense (17), pass defense (23)

Strength: When healthy, Larry Fitzgerald and Anquan Boldin are perhaps the best
pair of receivers in the NFL.

Weakness: Boldin and cornerback Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie were injured in the
regular-season finale.

5. GREEN BAY PACKERS (11-5)

Cornerback Charles Woodson (nine interceptions) might be the NFL's defensive
player of the year, and the Packers' balance offensively and defensively makes
them a dangerous team right now.

High point of the season: Shut down the Cowboys 17-7 in Week 10 to turn their
season around

Low point: A 38-28 loss at Tampa Bay in Week 9 came on the heels of a 38-26 loss
to Brett Favre and the Vikings at Lambeau Field.

Longest win streak of the season: 5

Longest losing streak: 2

A look at the numbers (NFL rank): total offense (6), rushing offense (14),
passing offense (7), total defense (2), run defense (1), pass defense (5)

Strength: The Packers were inconsistent early in the season, but now they're
playing with swagger, having won seven of eight games.

Weakness: In the Packers' losses, the defense had some issues in the back end,
and that's not a good thing when facing teams with good passing attacks.

6. PHILADELPHIA EAGLES (11-5)

The Eagles seem to have two identities; they are either really good or really
bad. The shutout loss Sunday at Dallas provided more proof.

High point of the season: A 45-38 Sunday night victory over N.Y. Giants in Week
14

Low point: Losing 13-9 to the Oakland Raiders in Week 6 was bad, but wasting a
chance to secure a first-round bye with last week's loss at Dallas was more
significant.

Longest win streak of the season: 6

Longest losing streak: 2

A look at the numbers (NFL rank): total offense (11), rushing offense (22),
passing offense (10), total defense (12), run defense (9), pass defense (17)

Strength: They have an explosive passing attack powered by quarterback Donovan
McNabb and receivers DeSean Jackson and Jeremy Maclin.

Weakness: The Eagles have lost twice to Dallas this year and now get a third
meeting. Which Eagles team will show up?

CONFIDENCE GROWS FOR 3-0 COWBOYS

BYLINE: RAY BUCK, KNIGHT RIDDER NEWSPAPERS

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. E6

LENGTH: 605 words

DATELINE: IRVING, TEXAS


The Dallas Cowboys are 3-0. This perfect start has had a positive effect,
according to Cowboys coach Chan Gailey, especially for defensive players and
their self-esteem, to say nothing of what it has done to one-time skeptics of
this group.

The defense ranks 25th in the NFL (compared with ninth for the Cowboys' offense)
in yards allowed, but this phenomenon isn't about establishing rank in the
league; it's about building confidence, regardless of the opponent's offense,
Gailey said.

After allowing Washington's No. 1-ranked offense to roll up 504 yards and 35
points in the season opener, the Cowboys' defense has held Atlanta's 19th-ranked
offense and Arizona's 28th-ranked offense to an average of 260 yards per game.

"We all know that part of this game is confidence. How you build confidence
doesn't matter," Gailey said yesterday. "What matters is, 'Can you go do it?' We
have confidence now that if we're behind in the fourth quarter, we can win
because we have done it 1/4Ragainst Washington 1/4S.

"We have confidence that we can get turnovers because we have done it 1/4R11
takeaways, including seven interceptions against Atlanta and Arizona 1/4S. These
are professional football teams we're playing. It's not like we're going out and
picking on Floyd Junior High."

Floyd Junior High? No significance in that name, Gailey said. Floyd Junior High
was completely hypothetical, Gailey assured.

There is an eighth- and ninth-grade football team in Floyd County, Va., located
25 miles south of the Virginia Tech campus in Blacksburg, Va., nicknamed the
Buffaloes, coached by David Blaha and Clay Moran, but this can't be the Floyd
Junior High to which Gailey referred. Because "that" Floyd Junior High team is
2-3, with twice as many wins as Atlanta and Arizona put together.

The Cowboys are simply playing the schedule they've been dealt. But the fact
remains that the NFL schedule maker has afforded the Cowboys a break in the
early going by pitting them against opponents with either snooze-alarm offenses
or injured playmakers or both.

Quarterback Chris Chandler did not start for the Falcons, and running back Jamal
Anderson left early with a season-ending knee injury. Big-play receiver Rob
Moore was missing from the Cardinals' offense, and quarterback Jake Plummer
appears to still be bothered by a sprained thumb suffered in preseason.

Next up are Philadelphia (0-4 with the 30th-ranked offense) and the New York
Giants (averaging 17 points per game with the 25th-ranked offense), both on the
road.

The Atlanta-Arizona-Philadelphia-New York stretch of the schedule enables the
Cowboys, with injuries of their own, to play and win with backups subbing for
injured starters. This, of course, speaks well for the Cowboys' backup players,
but it also says something about the schedule. Atlanta, Arizona, Philadelphia
and the Giants are a combined 3-13.

The past two opponents, Atlanta and Arizona, have a combined minus-16 turnover
ratio.

So, the timing has been good for the Cowboys, who now must deal with two knee
sprains at a couple of all-to-familiar positions -- cornerback and offensive
line -- for injuries on the team.

Gailey said he has been impressed with the overall team speed on defense, which
has been noticeably upgraded on the defensive line and at linebacker. The move
of Alonzo Spellman from defensive end to defensive tackle has been a huge
factor. Spellman had his best game yet as a Cowboys player Sunday, Gailey noted.

There is still a long season ahead, and a tougher schedule around the corner,
beginning with the rematch with Washington Oct. 24 at Texas Stadium.

Oregon Smoking Law Bans Lighting Up With Children in Car

LENGTH: 331  words


Smokers have been pushed out of commercial airplanes, restaurants and public
building, but in Oregon they are on the verge of being pushed out of their own
cars if they are accompanied by children.


The Oregon House Monday overwhelming passed a bill that makes it illegal for
smokers to take a puff with kids in the vehicle. The bill is now headed for Gov.
John Kitzhaber desk for his signature.
Opponents called it another "nanny state" provision that may have little to no
effect. The bill would allow police to ticket smokers if they were pulled over
for another offense. The violation would cost $250 for the first offense and
$500 for subsequent offenses.
State Rep. Jim Thompson said the legislation was another way to address the
trouble of exposure to second-hand smoke.
"This is a bill whose time has come," Thompson told The Oregonian. "We clearly
know the effects of second-hand smoke on health. It is, however, legal to strap
your kids in the back of a car and smoke them like bacon."
State Rep. Jeff Barker because the bill made the offense a secondary offense,
meaning police would not be able to pull over a motorist if the officer saw the
driver smoking with a kid present. He said many police departments urge officers
to issue one ticket per traffic stop.
"If this is that important, it shouldn't be a secondary offense," Barker said.
"It should be a primary offense."
State Sen. Bruch Starr said the bill could start a chain of legislation
targeting behavior, pointing to New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg's attempt
to ban large soft drinks.
"What about the Super Big Gulp? What about the trips through the McDonald's
drive through?" Starr asked.
Another state senator, Jeff Kruse, was more direct: "How dare the government
tell me what I can do in my car," said Kruse.
Arkansas, California, Louisiana and Maine have enacted similar legislation,
along with several cities and counties around the country, according to Global
Advisers on Smoke-free Policy, and advocacy group.

Belichick a modern-day throwback

BYLINE: DAVID PEVEAR, Sun Staff

SECTION: SPORTS

LENGTH: 810 words

DATELINE: FOXBORO


Vince Lombardi. Wow.

Pretty holy company, wouldn't you say?

Patriots coach Bill Belichick last Sunday became historically linked to Lombardi
when he tied the man for whom pro football's ultimate prize is named for the
highest playoff winning percentage [9-1, .900] in NFL history.

Lombardi and his winning-is-everything scripture still cast a spell over the NFL
and America's business boardrooms, 35 years after his death at age 57. Regarding
comparisons of Belichick to Lombardi, Belichick humbly stated, "I think that's
stretching it a little bit."

Belichick is right. Other than his knack for winning championships, he is no
Vince Lombardi. The coaching deity Belichick more closely resembles and whose
legend he more fanatically aspires toward is Paul Brown, the true father of
modern football, for whom the Cleveland Browns he coached to 10 consecutive
championship games from 1946 to 1955 [winning seven titles, including three NFL
titles] are named.

"Many of the things that we do today, and that I did when I was at Cleveland [as
head coach from 1991-95], are the same things that Paul Brown did," said
Belichick about his coaching hero who died in 1991. "The same schedule, the same
philosophy, the same approach to getting your team to perform to the highest
level on the practice field, in meetings, in strategy, in game situations. The
level that he was at, I think was way ahead of the competition at that point.
And it's very, very much the blueprint for the way the game is played today,
including the West Coast Offense."

Belichick is very much his father's son on the subject of Paul Brown. His
86-year-old father Steve, a former Detroit Lions fullback who coached college
football for 43 years, remains Paul Brown's greatest admirer.

The elder Belichick first met Brown while coaching at Hiram College in Ohio. "We
had a football banquet in Cleveland that Paul Brown was a speaker at, and I
don't know that Paul ever spoke anyplace else," a grateful Steve Belichick once
said.

The West Coast Offense, pro football's trendiest offense of the last 20 years,
is usually traced to Bill Walsh in San Francisco. Rewind further and you will
find Walsh was an assistant coach under Brown with the Cincinnati Bengals. One
of Walsh's offensive assistants in San Francisco was Mike Holmgren. Holmgren
became head coach in Green Bay in 1992 and hired Andy Reid as an assistant coach
and taught him the West Coast offense. Reid took that offense to Philadelphia
when he became the Eagles' head coach in 1999.

It is that offense Belichick's celebrated defense must confront next Sunday in
Super Bowl XXXIX in Jacksonville. Paul Brown's offense.

"It should be the Ohio River Offense," Steve Belichick once said. "Hells bells,
I mean, Paul Brown, his contributions to football are so great. It always
bothered me that the league hasn't honored Paul the way they should."

Lombardi's greatest impact on next Sunday's game will be the silver trophy
handed out to the winner, and that should never be diminished. Belichick's
Patriots share many of the honorable traits of those storied Packers of the
1960s. The highly disciplined football the Packers of Lombardi played was basic
kick-you-in-the-teeth, executed to perfection. The Patriots can resort to that
when necessary.

Lombardi was likewise a highly intelligent man. He was to football psychology
what Belichick is to defense a genius. His teams were the toughest in league
history. They won five NFL titles in seven years. Belichick's Patriots are after
their third Lombardi Trophy in four years.

Belichick, a voracious reader of books about coaching, told me last season while
I was working on a story about Lombardi, "The big thing about Lombardi was his
preaching of fundamentals. In a complex game like football, where there are a
lot of different skills involved and a lot of different positions, in the end
you have to have a good fundamental base. For him it was blocking and tackling
and a lot of the real fundamentals of the game. He was a real stickler and
stressed those. That's something we can all hang our hat on, whether you coach
the run 'n shoot, the wing-T, the I [formation], or the 4-3 or 3-4 defense.
Fundamental football, that's 90 percent the same no matter what you do."

To many of the Patriots players, "Lombardi" means the trophy for which they
bleed, sweat and strive to raise. Patriots center Dan Koppen joked that he
didn't even get halfway through reading a book about Lombardi.

"You can't say [Lombardi] doesn't mean anything to you, because that would be
very disrespectful of the past," said Koppen. "The past is a big part of this
league and why it is where it is today. Obviously it's a great compliment [for
the Patriots to be compared to the great teams of the past] but a compliment
that really has no bearing on this game."

Giants offense remains off target;
Unit searching for solutions for final stretch

BYLINE: Lorenzo Reyes, @LorenzoGReyes, USA TODAY Sports

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 3C

LENGTH: 635 words


The offense has become predictable and unproductive, and as the New York Giants
enter the home stretch of their schedule, a fix is necessary.

Rookie wide receiver Sterling Shepard was not targeted in a victory against the
Cleveland Browns in Week 12, then veteran Victor Cruz did not see a pass thrown
in his direction during Sunday's loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers. Quarterback
Eli Manning apologized to Shepard, and Cruz had "an honest conversation" with
coach Ben McAdoo.

"When you have good receivers and a lot of playmakers, some weeks you're going
to get targeted more than others," Manning said. "It's not necessarily because
of the game plan. It's just what other teams are doing, what they're playing and
how the game unfolds."

So what to do?

Wideout Odell Beckham Jr. offered some thoughts.

"Just spread it around," he told reporters Wednesday. "Move it around and play
fast. I feel like when you play fast, it makes it harder for other teams. They
may make mistakes. Even if you play fast and make a mistake, at least you're
making it full speed. I think it's a lot harder for defenses to adjust and call
what they want to call when the offense is moving at such a fast pace.

"I feel like the defense will worry about lining up more. Definitely have to
find ways to get the ball in the hands of the playmakers. Like we've been
preaching, we just need to be more productive on offense."

McAdoo said changes could be coming to the offense.

One place to start might be the personnel groupings. The Giants have run a
staggering 90% of their 299 first-and-10 plays this season using three
receivers, one tight end and one running back. They rank last in the NFL with
112 unique lineups on offense. As solid as the Giants' pass catchers are, that
kind of predictability could be giving defenses an advantage.

Force-feeding passes to Beckham also might be part of the issue. In the last two
weeks, he has fielded 27 targets. Over that span, Shepard and Cruz combined for
13.

When McAdoo was promoted from offensive coordinator to head coach in the
offseason, the prevailing thought was that New York's offense would be the
team's strength. Instead, it's the biggest weakness -- and not just because of
the struggling passing attack. New York's anemic ground game ranks
second-to-last in the NFL, gaining 77.5 rushing yards per game.

"I think it is just a level of consistency from top to bottom," Cruz said. "Not
just the receivers, not just the tight ends -- I think it is everyone being on
the same page, because it takes all of us to be on the same page in order to be
productive and successful from top to bottom."

The Giants are one of four teams that have failed to score 30 points in a game
this season. They are tied for 23rd in scoring, averaging 20.4 points per game.
With 327.4 yards per game, they are 26th in total offense. Compare that to last
season, when New York scored 30 or more points seven times. The Giants finished
eighth in yards (372 per game) and sixth in scoring (26.2 points per game).

And it likely won't get any easier to find the end zone for a team that likely
has to secure a wild card to reach the playoffs.

New York's next three games come against some of the league's stingiest
defenses, each ranked in the top 11 for fewest points allowed. Sunday night's
showdown against the Dallas Cowboys is hugely important since a season sweep of
the first-place Cowboys (11-1) is the only way the Giants (8-4) can win the NFC
East. But just getting a win is vital as teams behind them, including the Tampa
Bay Buccaneers and Green Bay Packers, begin heating up.

"This is a playoff game for us in my mind," said Beckham, who's apparently
already looking toward a Super Bowl path.

"So are the rest of them. You have to win eight games. That's how I look at it.
You have to win eight games straight."

Sept. 16--DURHAM -- Former Boy Scouts leader John Herbert Adams of Bahama in
Durham County pleaded guilty Wednesday to sex offenses involving a child, a
Raleigh television station reported.

Adams was sentenced in Durham County Superior Court to at least 12 years in
prison, WNCN reported. He will have to register as a sex offender, the station
reported.

Adams had been accused in spring 2014 of taking indecent photos of a girl
between ages 3 and 4.

He was charged with first-degree sex offense with a child, two counts of taking
indecent liberties with a child, several counts of sexual exploitation of a
child and misdemeanor contributing to the delinquency of a juvenile.

John Adams is the older brother of Michael Adams, the executive editor of The
Fayetteville Observer.

Big 12 efficiency rankings: OSU's defense better than you think

BYLINE: Berry Tramel

SECTION:

LENGTH: 573 words


[img width="" height="" style="" render="w620"]4524736[/img]Time for the weekly
Big 12 efficiency rankings, and here's what I love about this metric. You learn
stuff you didn't know. Like this:* OSU's defense is fast becoming a lot better
statistically.* Texas Tech's offense is overrated.* Baylor's offense and defense
is middle of the road in the league.* Texas' defense is not as bad as we
thought.* OU's offense is even better than we thought.Don't buy it. Let's get to
the numbers.

Remember, efficiency measures how often an offense scores based on how many
possessions it gets, and how often a defense gets off the field without allowing
points. And it gives full credit for touchdowns and half credit for field
goals.Here are the rankings:OFFENSE1. Oklahoma .540: This remains an historic
number. OU's 2015 offense led the league with a .485 efficiency. Baylor led the
previous two years, at .471 and .439. The Sooners are well ahead of all those
paces. This is crazy offense.2. Oklahoma State .442: The Cowboys have been
prolific and still get Texas Tech's defense. This number could rise.3. West
Virginia .422: Surprise! WVU's offense is getting better and better.4. Texas
Tech .414: Here's a bar bet you can win. Tech doesn't have one of the top three
offenses in the Big 12. But it's true. In the last two games, the Red Raiders
have had 26 possessions and produced six touchdowns and two field goals.5.
Baylor .387: The Bears still have a good offense. Just not as good as Baylor's
recent offenses, and it's hard to keep up in this conference.6. Texas .383: Good
solid offense for the Longhorns. Good enough to threaten West Virginia?7. TCU
.364: The Frogs slowly are reverting into a typical Gary Patterson team. Better
on defense than on offense.8. Kansas State .361: OK on offense. Just not
explosive like so many others.9. Iowa State .306: This is losing offense in most
leagues. It's no-hope in the Big 12.10. Kansas .155: Where have you gone Bobby
Douglas and David Jaynes and Nolan Cromwell and Chip Hilleary and Todd
Reesing?DEFENSE1. West Virginia .263: Winning defense. An OU-WVU showdown will
be a classic contrast of strengths.2. TCU .306: Here comes the Horned Frogs.
TCU-OSU next week will be similar to OU-WVU.3. Oklahoma State .321: Can the
Cowboys keep close to this number with Tech and OU still on the schedule?4.
Texas .338: Not half bad. And the Longhorns still play Kansas. Maybe it's time

BUCS SEND MIXED SIGNALS

BYLINE: MIKE COBB The Ledger

SECTION: Sports; Pg. C1

MINNEAPOLIS

There were signs of hope for Tampa Bay's offense in Sunday's 21-14 loss at
Minnesota, but there were just as many signs of confusion.

And as we reach the end of the first quarter of the 1999 season, how you read
this offense, and this team's chances of becoming a factor in the postseason,
depends on which signs you read.

It's an offense that racked up 370 yards, including 301 passing yards by
quarterback Trent Dilfer. It's also an offense that got just 14 points out of
all those yards, missing a couple of chances to score late in the game to send
it to overtime.

For the first time all year, the Bucs were able to throw the ball downfield
successfully, completing 15 passes of 11 yards or longer.

When they had to make one yard, though, they couldn't.

Five times, on two different possessions, they failed to get a first down with
one yard to go.

It's an offense that drove into Vikings territory seven times, but it's also an
offense that scored just two touchdowns from those seven drives.

Given what this Buccaneer offense had done in its first three games, the fact
that they moved the ball Sunday was encouraging.

"Our offense is coming around," said guard Jorge Diaz. "We just didn't make the
plays at the end of the game."

And that's what's still perplexing and disturbing.

If they learn to finish drives they start, the Bucs could be the team to beat in
the NFC because they have a championship caliber defense.

You can write off Minnesota's 21-point first quarter as a rarity. It won't be
often that the Buccaneer defense gets torched the way it did in the first 15
minutes of Sunday's game.

That leaves it up to the offense to make this team a playoff-caliber team. At
times, Sunday, it looked like a playoff offense. When it counted most, though,
it didn't.

Because of that, the Bucs are 2-2, tied with Minnesota and Chicago and a
half-game behind Green Bay and Detroit. Their next three games are against Green
Bay, Chicago and Detroit.

It remains to be seen whether the Bucs got better offensively Sunday.

Cornerback Ronde Barber said they never panicked after falling behind, 21-0,
because, "this is the NFL. In the NFL, 21 points is nothing."

Unless you're Tampa Bay's offense. For an offense that hasn't scored more than
19 this year, 21 points would be something.

If what Barber said was true of the Bucs' offense, if they could consistently
score 21 points, this is a team that could win the NFC title.

NOTEBOOK: FOOTBALL;
Huff-Huff, Bang-Bang: It's Run-and-Shoot Fever

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY W. SMITH

SECTION: Section 8; Page 3; Column 5; Sports Desk

LENGTH: 786 words


Three of the eight teams that made the National Football League divisional
playoffs were run-and-shoot teams, an indication that something about that
offense must be working.

Only a few years ago most N.F.L. coaches were saying that the run-and-shoot was
a fad that would never take root in the league.

Houston, Atlanta and Detroit use variations of the run-and-shoot offense, which
deploys four wide receivers and no tight ends, spreading out an opposing defense
across the field.

Darrel (Mouse) Davis, a longtime proponent of the run-and-shoot offense who is
the coach of the New York/New Jersey Knights of the World League of American
Football, said the presence of three run-and-shoot teams in the playoffs is just
a matter of teams' sticking with the offense and finding the right personnel to
make it work.

Controlling and Stabilizing

"I really think that what has occurred is people have gotten to the point that
no longer are they seeing it as a variety of problems, but seeing it as an
effective way to move the ball on the ground and in the air, and seeing how it
controls defensive looks and stabilizes defensive looks," Davis said.

Atlanta and Houston finished in the top 10 in the N.F.L. in offense, at No. 8
and No. 2, respectively. The Lions finished as No. 17, but were 10th in rushing,
mainly because of running back Barry Sanders, the league's second-leading
rusher.

Davis said if Detroit had stuck with the pure form of the offense, then it could
have been ranked in the top five in offense this year.

The Lions dismissed Davis at the end of last season, and restructured their
offense, making Sanders more a focal point. And he had 1,548 yards rushing.
Detroit did not have a receiver with over 60 receptions and 1,000 yards this
season, while Houston had two 1,000-yard receivers, Haywood Jeffires (1,181) and
Drew Hill (1,109), and another, Ernest Givins, was only 4 yards away with 996
yards. Jeffires had 100 catches, Hill had 90 and Givins had 70.

Purest of Forms

Oddly, Davis said that Atlanta, which calls its run-and-shoot the Red Gun, is
running the offense in its purest form: out of the shotgun. He said that in the
last few weeks, the Oilers had gone back to running it the way it should be run,
but they haven't had very much success scoring, averaging just two touchdowns a
game in their last six games.

Davis said the main reason that the three run-and-shoot teams made it this far
in the playoffs was because of their defenses. But Davis even credits the
run-and-shoot offense with helping to develop a team's defense.

"One of the major factors of the offensive system is that once you have the
quarterback and the other skilled people you can concentrate on getting the
defensive talent that you need," Davis said.

Bubba Paris's Odyssey

Bubba Paris has been on the N.F.L.'s version of a crazy hayride. He was cut by
the 49ers in training camp, because team officials were frustrated that Paris, a
6-foot-6-inch, 315-pound tackle, wouldn't lose weight.

He was picked up by Indianapolis and stayed through 13 weeks of losing. The
Colts cut him and he was picked up by Detroit on Dec. 10.

Paris said that his being cut by the Colts, who finished 1-15, and picked up by
Detroit, a team that was 12-4 and in the playoffs, was an answer to a prayer.

"When I first went to Indianapolis I went in from San Francisco where in the
previous two years I had only lost two games," Paris said. "So when I went in I
was very enthusiastic. I tried to instill in everyone there that there's no law
that said you should lose a game or it's impossible not to win.

"The first week I said we'd go 16-0, then I said we'd go 15-1, then 14-2. Then,
it got to the point where instead of people trying to rise to the occasion they
just fell into a stupor. I became very depressed."

Paris, who blocked for 49ers quarter Joe Montana, said that Colts quarterback
Jeff George is "a lineman's nightmare."

"A quarterback that doesn't know how to read a pocket is a lineman's nightmare,"
Paris said. "They could put a line of all-world players in front of him and
unless he learns how to orchestrate and work with them, read pockets and holes,
he'll still get hurt."

Paris compared Montana to a great orchestra conductor.

"A conductor, through nonverbal communication, tells the cymbals when to come
in, tells the drummers when to come in and the flutes when to start playing,"
Paris said.

He said if George would listen to suggestions by his veteran linemen on where to
set up in the pocket he could reduce his sacks and buy himself more time to
pass.

"Jeff George has the talent and the ability," he said. "If he lives long enough,
he'll be a great quarterback."

AFC CHAMPIONSHIP GAME

BYLINE: Ryan O'Halloran

SECTION: Pg. C-6

LENGTH: 386 words


NEW ENGLAND (13-4) AT DENVER (14-3), 3 P.M., CBS

Line: Broncos by 5 1/2

Quick look: The two best teams in the AFC this year, the Patriots will try to
make their sixth Super Bowl of the Bill Belichick-Tom Brady Era, and the Broncos
are vying for their first Super Bowl trip since the John Elway-Terrell Davis
days and third appearance for Peyton Manning.

Last playoff meeting: Denver won 27-13 in an AFC divisional round game on Jan.
6, 2006, to end the Patriots' bid for a three-peat.

Rankings: Patriots - total offense (seventh), run offense (ninth), pass offense
(10th), total defense (26th), run defense (30th), pass defense (18th). Broncos -
total offense (first), run offense (15th), pass offense (first), total defense
(19th), run defense (seventh), pass defense (27th).

QB matchup: Teams quarterbacked by Manning and Brady face each other for the
15th time -- Brady leads 10-4, including 2-1 in the postseason. This is their
first playoff meeting since the January 2007 AFC title game, won by the Colts.
Manning's 55 touchdown passes this year broke Brady's record of 50. Brady had 25
TDs this year.

Key matchup: Patriots pass rusher Chandler Jones vs. Broncos left tackle Chris
Clark. Jones led the Patriots with 11.5 regular-season sacks and had one against
Indianapolis last week. He rarely leaves the field and lines up in a two-point
stance. Clark replaced the injured Ryan Clady in early October and is a part of
a Denver offensive line that has allowed only 20 sacks in 17 games. If Jones can
get blind-side pressure on Manning, it will force him to step up in the pocket
and potentially into trouble.

X-factor: Patriots receiver Danny Amendola. Signed to replace Wes Welker (now
with Denver) as New England's slot receiver, Amendola missed four of the first
seven weeks and has only two 100-yard games this year. But he had three catches
for 77 yards last week and should be able to take advantage of Denver's depleted
secondary, especially if Champ Bailey covers the slot.

Prediction: New England 34, Denver 27. There was a lot to like about the
Patriots' win over Indianapolis (takeaways, Julian Edelman's performance and
LeGarrette Blount's running) and a lot to dislike about Denver's win over San
Diego (keeping the Chargers in the game and the secondary's ineffectiveness).
Add it up, and it's the Patriots.

Charges against Perez latest in unsettling line

BYLINE: I.J. Rosenberg; STAFF WRITER

SECTION: SPORTS, Pg. 5D

LENGTH: 343 words


It is becoming an ugly trend for collegiate and professional athletes.

The arrest Saturday of Montreal pitcher Carlos Perez at a downtown hotel for
allegedly raping and sodomizing a 20-year-old woman is another in a long line of
alleged crimes by athletes.

In the past month, Cincinnati Bengals defensive lineman Dan Wilkinson was
accused of punching his pregnant wife in the stomach. Also, Nebraska Heisman
Trophy candidate Lawrence Phillips was charged with hitting his girfriend, and
two Tennessee football players, Leslie Ratliffe and Nilo Silvan, were accused of
assaulting women.

After the Perez incident, Expos manager Felipe Alou addressed his team. "I told
the kids that whether the allegations against Perez are true or not, you have to
be alert and careful," he said. "You have to respect the rights of other
people."

Braves reserve outfielder Luis Polonia, who had been with Perez at a bar Friday
before the alleged incident, knows full well the trama surrounding such an
incident. In 1989, when he was playing for the New York Yankees, he was
convicted in Milwaukee of having sexual intercourse with a 15-year-old girl. He
was fined $ 1,500 and served half of a 60-day jail term.

"I know how painful it can be," said Polonia, who made certain to point out to
reporters that he had "nothing to do" with the Perez incident. "My reputation
has been put back in place, I don't want anybody thinking he was involved."

The Perez incident was also discussed Sunday in the Braves clubhouse.

"First you feel sad, because if it is all made up and he is innocent, his name
is attached with a crime that will be with him forever," said David Justice. "If
he is guilty he should pay the price just like any other person would because it
is a terrible thing.

"This is just another cloud over the athletic world, people feeling athletes
rape, use drugs, carry guns. But look at how many athletes there are and how
many have been charged with something. It's such a small percentage of guys, no
different from the rest of society."

Raiders' back-and-fourth on offense is glaring inefficiency

BYLINE: By Cam Inman cinman@bayareanewsgroup.com

SECTION: SPORTS; News; Football

LENGTH: 605 words


Rarely is the football in Chris Morris' hands, and he's usually the Raiders
center. Such is life on the league's worst-ranked offense.

The Raiders (1-4) simply can't find the first-down marker to retain possession.
They have averaged only 10.8 first downs in their first five games, one of
several categories in which they rank 32nd. Among the others: yards per game
(191.6) and time of possession (25 minutes, 17 seconds).

"The offense has to do a better job of not going three (plays)-and-out. It's
been plaguing us the last four weeks," Morris said Monday at team headquarters
in Alameda, a day after the Raiders lost their third straight game, a 44-7 rout
by the host New York Giants.

First downs are a familiar problem for a team deluged by many others. The
Raiders finished last in the league in 2008 with 14.1 first downs per game. In
contrast, their 2002 team reached the Super Bowl behind a potent offense that
led the league with 22.9 first downs per game.

Coach Tom Cable didn't announce any lineup changes and said quarterback JaMarcus
Russell's disappointing play is "the least of my concerns." Blocking was the
chief complaint from Cable, who has no plans to relinquish his play-calling
role.

"I really look at it as, is the play you call, does that have anything to do
with executing it?" Cable said. "Does it have anything to do with being in a
manageable third down?

Added tight end Zach Miller: "We've got to protect the quarterback and stay out
of third-and-long situations. We just haven't been executing and running the
ball like we're supposed to, so that hurts our offense. Guys are not making
plays. We're missing blocks, missing assignments, missing receivers. It's coming
down to a lack of execution on offense."


     ·    One new theory why Michael Vick isn't in a Raiders uniform   beside
          the distinct possibility the Raiders weren't interested in the ex-con
          is that NBC analyst Tony Dungy recommended against it.


"I advised Michael Vick not to go there," Dungy said on Sunday's "Football Night
in America" broadcast. "I said, 'Mike, you might be able to start there but that
is not a good place for you.'"

Vick and the Philadelphia Eagles visit the Raiders on Sunday. In relief of
Donovan McNabb during Sunday's 33-14 win over Tampa Bay, Vick completed his
first pass since 2006, a 1-yard toss to DeSean Jackson. Vick ran four times for
10 yards and has completed 1 of 5 passes in two games since his reinstatement.


     ·    Fox Sports' Jay Glazer reported that the Raiders contacted several
          teams last week seeking to trade anyone except their "young, talented
          players." Asked if the Raiders were exploring trades, Cable said: "Not
          right now. We typically work on those sort of roster things in the
          next two days."



     ·    Injuries could have a big impact on the linebacking corps. Kirk
          Morrison sustained a sprained knee en route to his season-high 16
          tackles Sunday. Ricky Brown suffered an ankle injury that could result
          in season-ending surgery.



     ·    Running back Darren McFadden and offensive tackle Cornell Green have
          been ruled out of the game against the Eagles. Linebacker Brown
          (ankle) could be facing season-ending surgery or simply be out four
          weeks, Cable said. Wide receiver Chaz Schilens (foot) and guard Robert
          Gallery (leg) might return this week.



     ·    The Raiders have allowed the sixth most sacks in the league with 15,
          one less than the 49ers' tally. "Our offensive line needs to step up
          and keep JaMarcus (Russell) off his back so he can make those throws,"
          Miller said.



     ·    The Raiders are the only team in the league to have thrown only one
          touchdown pass, that coming 93 passes ago by Russell in the
          season-opening loss to San Diego.

Former Broncos' receiver coach Jedd Fisch named Minnesota Gophers' new offensive
coordinator

BYLINE: By Marcus R. Fuller mfuller@pioneerpress.com

SECTION: SPORTS; Breaking

LENGTH: 793 words


Tim Brewster thought he wanted to run a spread offense when he took over as
University of Minnesota football coach in 2007, so he hired spread guru Mike
Dunbar to be his offensive coordinator.

That style didn't work. Dunbar resigned.

Now, Brewster wants to run a more diversified offense, so Wednesday he hired an
up-and-coming NFL offensive coach in Jedd Fisch, who was a Denver Broncos wide
receivers coach until Mike Shanahan was fired after the just-completed season.

Fisch's offensive style is flexible and undefined. He's not a spread coach. The
Gophers didn't run a spread offense to end last season. So they have something
in common.

"I definitely wouldn't characterize myself as a spread coach," said Fisch, 32,
who has been an NFL assistant since 2001 with Houston, Baltimore and Denver.
"I've had a great opportunity to start my football life with (Steve) Spurrier at
Florida. There will be some Steve Spurrier football, no question. Everybody in
Minneapolis knows what kind of an offensive coach Brian Billick was. He had one
of the most prolific offenses in football history with the Vikings. I plan to
bring that back to Minneapolis."

Asked what kind of offensive coach he would be, Fisch said: "I'm an explosive
offensive coach. Whatever that is, whether it's East Coast, West Coast, pro
style. I don't know what the definition is. We're going to be the Gophers'
offense. We're going to 'Go-fer' touchdowns."

Fisch recently helped with play-calling duties on the Broncos and mentored
Denver's talented young receiving tandem of Brandon Marshall and Eddie Royal in
2008. It was his first season as a full-time position coach.

But now he faces the biggest challenge of his career in his first season as a
coordinator at any level.

The Gophers finished 10th in scoring offense (17.0 points a game) and worst in
rushing offense (77.9 yards a game) and total offense (281.5 yards) in Big Ten
Conference games last year, which prompted Brewster to hire offensive line
coach/running game coordinator Tim Davis, who had some input in the offense.

Minnesota implemented a more conventional running style with quarterback Adam
Weber under center in the Insight Bowl loss to Kansas. Fisch said he understood
Brewster wanted to do what fit his personnel best and get back to what made the
Gophers successful in the past.

"If we have to run to win football games, then we're going to run," Fisch said.
"If we have to pass to win football games, then we're going to pass. We'll do
anything to win, whether it's one-back, two-back, zone scheme, shotgun or under
center. ... We'll sit down and look at some film of last year. Once we get an
idea of who our playmakers are, we'll figure out ways to get them the ball.
That's what we'll do."

Brewster said the offensive coordinator "needs to be the lone play caller," but
he and Davis would collaborate with Fisch, who will be calling plays on his own
for the first time.

"Play calling I don't think it's that big a deal," Brewster said. "If you're a
good football coach, then you understand the game. Plus, the guys that he's been
around were tremendous coaches. Calling plays will be no issue for (Fisch)."

Brewster's top priority was to bring in a coach who could work with Minnesota's
quarterbacks: Weber, MarQueis Gray, Moses Alipate and John Nance. Weber will be
a third-year starter as a junior. Gray, Alipate and Nance will be freshmen.

"He did an outstanding job in the interview process explaining how strong his
quarterback knowledge is," Brewster said of Fisch, who was an assistant
quarterbacks/receivers coach when veteran Steve McNair earned Pro Bowl honors
with the Ravens in 2006. "Jedd is an outstanding quarterbacks coach. Peyton
Manning wanted him to come to the (Indianapolis) Colts to be his quarterbacks
coach."

"He understands the game, progression and the fundamentals for a quarterback,"
said former Broncos quarterbacks coach Jeremy Bates, who was hired this week to
coach the same position at Southern California. "(Fisch) has his own style. He's
going to take a little bit from every coach he's been with. I'm looking forward
to seeing what he does on Saturdays. I think Minnesota fans should be excited to
see it, too."

Fisch's age and strong reputation -- he interviewed for the Detroit Lions'
offensive coordinator position Monday -- make him seem like a short-lived hire,
but the Gophers gave him incentive to stay. His two-year contract will pay him
$200,000 this year and $320,000 if he remains in 2010.

There's another reason to stick around. He'll get a chance to play his buddy
Bates and USC, because Minnesota is finalizing a deal to play home and home
against the Trojans starting in 2010.

"That will be great," Fisch said, "But I'm looking forward to playing USC in the
Rose Bowl in 2009."

Bears not defensive about offense

BYLINE: Mike Garafolo

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 7C

LENGTH: 255 words


The Chicago Bears have an offense. And, like its defense, it can score points.
No, really. In last weekend's romp against the Tennessee Titans, the Bears
offense scored 37 points.

Now for the disclaimer: Three touchdowns came on drives of 16 yards or less,
thanks to that spotlight-hogging, ball-stripping defense. The Bears rank 25th in
overall offense and 29th in passing, which proves how dominant their defense has
been in a 7-1 season.

"We're not going to catch the defense this year," quarterback Jay Cutler said.
"It's not going to happen. We're eight, nine years behind those guys. They've
been in the same system a long time.

"We've just got to focus on ourselves. Every guy has just got to get a little
bit better each week."

Even with an inconsistent offense,  the Bears  sit atop the NFC North as they
head into Sunday night's game against the Houston Texans (7-1), who lead the AFC
South.

If the Bears offense still is a work in progress, when will it click?

"I'm thinking 2015," Cutler joked. "We have goals. We want to win now. We're
doing a good job of it. Will we be a No.1 offense this year? I don't know. It
doesn't look like it, but what we're doing is effective. We just have to be a
little bit more productive and start a little bit faster."

That could be tough against the Texans, whose defense is third overall, second
against the run and fourth against the pass.

"It's a mixed bag of things," Cutler said. "But, with our defense, if we make
their offense go 80, 90 yards, I think we're going to be OK."

Marshall s Petersen leaving for La. Tech;
With loss of QBs coach, Rippon, Marshall in search of coordinators

BYLINE: DEREK REDD, DAILY MAIL SPORTSWRITER

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. P1B

LENGTH: 462 words


HUNTINGTON - Both under center as a quarterback and as a member of the coaching
staff, Tony Petersen helped engineer some explosive offenses at Marshall
University. Now he'll do it at Louisiana Tech.

According to sources, Petersen, the Thundering Herd's co-offensive coordinator
and quarterbacks coach, is leaving to become the offensive coordinator for new
Louisiana Tech Coach Skip Holtz. Holtz took that job in December after being
fired from the University of South Florida after three seasons.

Petersen held the co-offensive coordinator title at Marshall, but offensive
coordinator Bill Legg handled playcalling duties.

Marshall's defensive coordinator position remains open, as former coordinator
Chris Rippon resigned the day after the Herd's season-ending loss at East
Carolina.

Louisiana Tech did not announce any news about its offensive coordinator job
Tuesday.

Petersen returned to the Herd in January 2010 as assistant head coach,
co-offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach. In 2012, Marshall was sixth in
the Football Bowl Subdivision in total offense (534.25 yards per game) and first
in passing offense (365.08 ypg). Quarterback Rakeem Cato was named Conference
USA's most valuable player after leading the FBS in passing yards per game
(350.08) and completions per game (38.83).

"It's easy knowing I don't have a quarterback coach that played somewhere else
or didn't play football at all," Cato said earlier this season. "My quarterback
coach played here at Marshall and he knows what it takes to win. He played so
great at this level and also had the opportunity to play at the next level."

Petersen spent from 1991-98 as receivers coach, then quarterbacks coach, then as
offensive coordinator in 1998. He then had stints as an assistant at Minnesota
(1999-2006), Iowa State (2007-08) and South Dakota (2009) before returning to
Marshall.

As a Herd quarterback, Petersen was named the 1987 Southern Conference offensive
player of the year and the 1988 conference athlete of the year. He owns MU's
single-season record for passing yards with 4,902.

The Bulldogs had one of the few offenses more prolific than Marshall's in 2012.
Louisiana Tech was first in the FBS in total offense (577.92 yards per game) and
first in scoring offense (51.5 points per game), while third in passing offense
(350.75 yards per game). The architect of that offense, Head Coach Sonny Dykes,
recently took the University of California head coaching job.

Holtz's offense at South Florida wasn't at the same level. The Bulls were 89th
in total offense (367.5 yards per game) and 104th in scoring offense (20.58
points per game).

Tuning up UCLA's sputtering offense

BYLINE: By ROBERT KUWADA , The Orange County Register

SECTION: SPORTS

LENGTH: 354 words

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES


The UCLA Bruins have lost consecutive games at Stanford and Washington State and
have no answers to the same old questions about an offense that has struggled to
move the football with any consistency.

``If we're rolling and this offense is hitting on all cylinders, this offense is
pretty good,'' said QB Matt Moore, who struggled to maintain drives for a second
consecutive week in a 31-13 loss at Washington State on Saturday and was
replaced in the fourth quarter by Drew Olson.

And, yes, Moore said, there have been times this season when everything worked.
The right reads have been made, the right holes have been hit and plays have
been executed. That has only added to the frustration on the field.

``I think that's our main problem, that we can't stay consistent with our
offense,'' Moore said. ``I'm not bad-mouthing anybody because I'm a big part of
the offense, but we just need to get going and ... improve all the time.''

RECRUITING HELP

Running back Marshawn Lynch and cornerback Virdell Larkins from Oakland Tech,
scheduled to make an official recruiting visit to UCLA this weekend for the
Oregon game, watched the loss to Washington State.

It didn't faze them.

``I haven't really been following any one team, I just watch the games,''
Larkins said. ``I don't like trip out or anything if they're not winning.''

Lynch and Larkins have visited Oregon and Washington State and have no plans for
another trip after UCLA.

Manhunt on for road rage dog killer
Police in San Jose, Calif., have assembled a photo gallery of suspects and spent
hours working up a sketch of the man who reached into a woman's car, snatched
her dog from her lap and threw him into oncoming traffic in a case of road rage.

People throughout the nation have donated more reward money to help find the
bichon frise's killer than they have to solve high-profile missing children's
cases in Northern California.

Witnesses said the suspect was upset after the car driven by the dog's owner,
Sara McBurnett, bumped his from behind Feb. 11. The 10-year-old dog, Leo, later
died at a veterinary hospital.

Firefighter admits killing wife, rescue personnel
A Memphis firefighter has confessed to killing his new wife, setting her home on
fire and ambushing two firefighters and a sheriff's deputy called to the scene,
authorities said. Fredrick Williams, 41, was charged with murder, attempted
murder and arson in Wednesday's spree. He was under guard at a hospital, where
he was in stable condition from gunshot wounds.

Mother thanks captor for freeing 10-year-old
The mother of a 10-year-old girl who was snatched from her driveway and held for
three days thanked the child's captor for releasing her alive. Investigators
continued to hunt for the kidnapper and released no details of what happened to
Jessica Rodriguez during her captivity. Jessica was abducted by a man Monday
after getting off her school bus outside her rural home in Trenton, Fla. On
Thursday, she walked into a Wal-Mart 25 miles from home, asking for help.

Air Force rescue hero guilty of molestation
An Air Force helicopter pilot honored for leading a daring rescue off Iceland
was found guilty at a court-martial in Hurlburt Field, Fla., of repeatedly
molesting two underage girls. Col. James A. Sills, 48, was also found guilty of
assaulting his estranged wife, having an unprofessional relationship with his
secretary and lying during a security interview. He faces a possible prison term
of more than 30 years.

Medevac copter crash kills four, including baby
A medical evacuation helicopter crashed in fog in the Texas Panhandle, killing
four people, including an infant patient. The Life Star helicopter left
Northwest Texas Healthcare System in Amarillo to pick up a 4-month-old baby in
respiratory distress in Boise City, Okla., and was returning at the time of the
crash near Dalhart, Texas, said Moody Chisholm, the hospital's chief executive
officer.

Suit charges police let robber bleed to death
A gunman shot during a 1997 Hollywood bank robbery suffered an agonizing,
protracted death because police were deliberately indifferent to getting him
medical help, a lawyer argued in Los Angeles federal court. The lawsuit claims
police allowed Emil Matasareanu to bleed to death as he lay handcuffed in the
street after being shot 29 times in a furious gunbattle.

Accidents claim 12 lives at beer-fueled biker fest
At least 12 people have been killed in motorcycle accidents during Daytona
Beach's Bike Week this year, making it the deadliest such gathering in more than
a decade. Some died in wrecks on rural roads on their way to the annual event,
which began in 1937 and attracts 500,000 bikers from across the country. Others
were killed in collisions after beer-filled nights of carousing. The 10-day
festival is set to end Sunday.

Pennsylvania Amish pair cleared in baby's death
Samuel and Lizzie Esh Glick, the Dornsife, Pa., Amish couple suspected of child
abuse in the death of their 4-month-old daughter, have been cleared in the case.
Northumberland County District Attorney Anthony Rosini ruled that the baby died
of natural causes, not homicide. Sarah Lynn Glick died Dec. 23.

JSU football: Pace offenses means depth is big deal for Gamecocks' D-line

BYLINE: Mark Edwards, Sports Editor, medwards@annistonstar.com, The Anniston
Star, Ala.

SECTION: SPORTS

LENGTH: 559 words


Aug. 11--JACKSONVILLE -- Jacksonville State has an all-star foursome ready to
start on the defensive line this year.

Chris Landrum, Devaunte Sigler and LaMichael Fanning are preseason All-Ohio
Valley Conference picks. Sigler was the league's defensive player of the year
last season. Senior Allan Carson is expected to fill the fourth spot. He was a
standout at Oxford High School and Tennessee before transferring and serving as
a more-than-capable lineman for JSU last year.

With a group like that, who cares who's on the second team, right?

Actually, the way JSU head coach John Grass describes it, with the high-tempo
attacks that so many offenses are using these days -- including the Gamecocks --
it's more important than ever that teams have a deep defensive line.

"The pace offense has been a big equalizer," Grass said. "At times, as an
offensive line, you may face a great defensive line and be outmaneuvered and not
able to run the ball. But with a the pace offense, in the second and fourth
quarters, you may wear down that defensive line enough that you can run it."

Grass doesn't want his defensive line wearing down as it tries to defend a
high-tempo offense. Because of that, the second- and third-team defensive line
should be ready to play. This is the same philosophy JSU followed a year ago as
eight different defensive linemen had at least 16 tackles for the season and
nobody had more than 37.

"It used to be that if you had a great defensive line, they might've played
almost the whole game," Grass said. "It's not that way anymore. The ones and the
twos might get just about equal playing time. The third guy might be asked to
play 10 to 20 snaps."

Coming out of spring practice, sophomores Darius Jackson and Dalton Campbell
were the second-team defensive ends behind Landrum and Fanning. Freshman Montrez
Lang was second-team nose tackle behind Carson. Senior Martez House is No. 2 at
defensive tackle behind Sigler.

"With the speed of the game, we rotate a lot," said Landrum, who spent 2011-12
at Auburn before transferring to JSU. "The ones will play the first series, but
after that, the ones and twos will mix together. So it doesn't really matter a
lot if you're with the ones or the twos -- you'll get about the same amount of
snaps."

The biggest difference between the four starters and the rest of the defensive
line is experience. Fanning, Sigler, Landrum and Carson are seniors. All four
began at Southeastern Conference schools -- Fanning at Alabama, Carson at
Tennessee, and Sigler and Landrum at Auburn.

Carson said all four are trying to serve as leaders for the younger defensive
linemen, because they'll be needed on Saturdays, just as the starters are.

"We're the veterans," he said. "We're trying to train the young guys. That's
part of our job, bringing the young guys along. Everybody is getting better
together."

With the defensive line helping lead the way, JSU ranked first in the OVC last
year in scoring defense and rushing defense. The Gamecocks were second in total
defense.

Again, that included using plenty of defensive linemen.

"Our philosophy is for all positions is that if you're good enough to be on the
bus, you're going to get in the game," Grass said.

JURY STILL OUT ON KELLY'S CASE;
THE NEW COACH'S NO-HUDDLE SPREAD OFFENSE HAS EITHER BEEN TERRIBLE OR GREAT.;
PACKERS | SUNDAY'S OPPONENT

BYLINE:  WESTON HODKIEWICZ   Green Bay Press-Gazette

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. B4

LENGTH: 546 words

DATELINE: GREEN BAY


A week ago, this matchup didn't seem nearly as daunting for the Green Bay
Packers.

That was before the Packers lost quarterback Aaron Rodgers to a broken
collarbone in a 27-20 loss to the Chicago Bears and prior to their next
opponent, the Philadelphia Eagles, hitting on all offensive cylinders in a 49-20
shellacking of the Oakland Raiders.

The Eagles and first-year coach Chip Kelly were highlights of the 2013 NFL
offseason as pundits debated whether Kelly's high-octane offense could be as
successful in the NFL as it was at the University of Oregon. So far, the
hurry-up offense has been mostly feast or famine.

In a 33-27 win over Washington in the season opener, the Eagles ran 53 plays in
the first half, the second-most of any team in NFL history. More recently, the
system came under fire after registering 10 total points in losses to the Dallas
Cowboys and the New York Giants.

On Sunday, the tide finally turned for Philadelphia under second-year
quarterback Nick Foles, who threw for 406 yards and had more touchdown passes
(seven) than incompletions (six) in his first game back from a concussion.

The Packers studied many of Kelly's principles while fashioning their nohuddle
concepts, but those who played Oregon in the Pac-12 know the challenges Kelly's
offense presents to opposing defenses.

"I thought I was done playing Oregon. I thought I escaped," joked rookie
defensive lineman Datone Jones, who played at UCLA. "But no, it's a very
up-tempo offense. It's gets you tired, makes you really think, but I feel like
if you can get back up and get back to the huddle, you'll be OK. All we have to
do is execute."

Kelly cautioned during his Wednesday conference call with Green Bay media that
his famed no-huddle spread offense is simply "a tool in a tool box."

However, it was the first one he pulled out in the dominating win over the
Raiders. After receiver Riley Cooper caught a 42-yard screen pass from Foles on
the first series, it took all of 7 seconds after he stepped out of bounds for
the Eagles to snap the ball for the next play.

How successful has the no-huddle been? Kelly points to the Eagles' 4-5 record as
an indication it's still a work in progress, but it's one of the reasons
Philadelphia is fourth in both total offense (413.2 yards per game) and
offensive plays from scrimmage (599).

"We haven't faced that challenge from anyone yet," Packers cornerback Tramon
Williams said. "We'll have to make sure we're communicating well. They do come
out fast. They do run a pretty fast-paced offense. They kind of had Oakland a
little discombobulated last week with their tempo. They got off to a really fast
start. Hopefully, we can slow that down a little bit."

The 6-foot-6 Foles doesn't project as the prototypical quarterback for Kelly's
system, but he's thrown for 1,028 yards with 13 touchdowns against zero
interceptions en route to winning the job over Michael Vick. Quiet of late, Pro
Bowl running back LeSean McCoy still has been a perfect complement in the
backfield.

USC went 2-2 against Oregon during Packers outside linebacker Nick Perry's four
years with the Trojans. The key to victory was simple: Don't deviate from the
game plan, don't let them get off to a fast start and have enough conditioning
that you don't need to sub out unnecessarily.

Barber, Dayne help 3-0 Giants get ball rolling

BYLINE: Larry Weisman

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 8C; NFC Beat

LENGTH: 793 words


For years, the New York Giants' offensive unit fit that description
too well. Even the impartial observer could not help taking offense
at its performance.

Dating to the AFL-NFL merger in 1970, the Giants never have led
the NFL in offense, and generally their offensive rankings were,
well, rank. Until they moved up last year as a result of passing
desperately late in losing efforts, they had finished 20th or
worse in pass offense for 10 consecutive years. They ranked 27th
or lower in total offense for five years in a row before leaping
to 17th and eighth in passing.


Well, look at them now. Fourth in total offense, league leaders
in rushing, 3-0 where it really counts -- in wins and losses.

"We needed to get better on offense. So we made the improvements,
and it's showing right there," coach Jim Fassel says.

With two running backs giving them presence inside and outside,
Kerry Collins' reconditioning starting to pay off and a rebuilt
offensive line succeeding with a complement of older veterans,
the Giants also lead the NFL in average time of possession (36:09).

Rookie rusher Ron Dayne, the 11th overall pick in the draft, delivers
the up-the-gut punch. Tiki Barber gets fewer carries but provides
electricity when he bolts around the edge. They're known as Thunder
and Lightning, and they're both considered starters.

"Those two guys are not selfish," Fassel says. "Their attitude
allows this thing to work."

Barber and Dayne spent part of Tuesday signing T-shirts that feature
a Thunder and Lightning logo and clearly profit from their job-sharing.

"When we drafted him, I knew he was going to be a complement
to me, not a replacement," Barber says. "He wears defenses out.
Then I come in and run around them."

The irony is that the Giants were winless in preseason for the
first time since 1971.

"Even though we were 0-4 in the preseason, I felt we were a much
better football team," Fassel says. "And the confidence was
building even as we went 0-4, which sounds kind of crazy. But
we just went about our business. This team has had a very serious
approach to the game."

Not nasty: Analyzing Washington's problems through its
disappointing 1-2 start? Throw this one in the hopper: The Redskins
are too nice.

"We always come in with the nice-guy attitudes and we are going
to go out there and play that Dudley Do-Right stuff and not going
to hurt nobody," guard Tre Johnson says. "Since I've been here,
it's been like that. We've got to get our mad on. We've got to
get some stuff about us. We've got to be ready to go out there
and knock somebody the hell out."

Counting Cards: Most teams consider an early bye an insult,
the NFL's way of telling them they're nothing but a squashed varmint
on the road to the Super Bowl. But there's a plus side, and the
Arizona Cardinals can't dispute it. Ruined by injuries in the
preseason and opening day, they've had a chance to start healing.

Center Mike Gruttadauria (knee) should get his first start Sunday
against Green Bay, and some of the other MIAs -- left tackle L.J.
Shelton, guard Lester Holmes, defensive end Andre Wadsworth, linebacker
Zach Walz -- ought to be closer to taking the field.

When the Cardinals defeated Dallas 32-31, every one of their seven
inactive players was injured, and five of them were starters.
Shelton and Holmes went down in the season-opening loss to the
Giants, meaning the line had three new starters. Ethan Brooks,
replacing Shelton, never had started a game at left tackle. Not
in the NFL, college or high school.

Extra points: Tampa Bay's defense takes no prisoners on
third down. Opponents have converted a league-worst seven of 39
(17.9%). On the other extreme is San Francisco, allowing an NFL-high
average 8.1 yards a play on first down.  . . . Atlanta
DE Chuck Wiley had no sacks last year when he played for Carolina
but got two Sunday vs. the Panthers.  . . . Chicago is
the only NFL team without a first down by penalty.


Top Giants

Tiki Barber has averaged nearly 109 rushing yards a game through
the first three weeks of the season. If he maintains that pace,
he'll break the Giants' season record with 1,739. Only five Giants
running backs have managed 1,000-yard seasons in the club's 76-year
history. The club's 1,000-yard club:

ON THE GEORGIA TECH BEAT;
Addazio a fan of Jackets' offense

HIGHLIGHT: Boston College coach praises Tech's Johnson.


Steve Addazio thought it was 1999 or 2000. He was an assistant coach at Notre
Dame under Bob Davie, years before he would become head coach at Boston College.

Davie was kicking around the idea of moving to an option-based offense.

"Coach Davie, he said for a long time, 'I should just run the (expletive)
wishbone,'" Addazio said last week at the ACC spring meetings at Amelia Island,
Fla. "He loved that offense because he hated defending it."

Davie sent Addazio and two other offensive assistant coaches, Kevin Rogers and a
wide receivers coach named Urban Meyer, in the offseason to learn from perhaps
the preeminent expert in option football. The three coaches went to Statesboro
to spend a few days with coach Paul Johnson, then in the midst of winning two
Division I-AA (now FCS) championships at Georgia Southern.

"We were on a fact-finding mission," Addazio said.

Davie never adopted the offense at Notre Dame. Addazio said it was "because it
just felt like, could you really do that at Notre Dame?" Meyer went on to use
option concepts, some gleaned from Johnson, with considerable success at Utah,
Florida and Ohio State. The visit has taken on different significance this year,
as Addazio's team will open the season in Dublin against Georgia Tech and his
one-time tutor in the spread-option offense.

The trip to Statesboro, and Johnson's subsequent successes with the offense at
Navy and Tech, made a distinct impression on Addazio.

"Oh, my god," he said. "He's great. I mean, he's great. He's really good at what
he does. Really good."

Going into his fourth season, Addazio has used the option at Boston College. The
Eagles were particularly successful with it in 2014, when quarterback Tyler
Murphy was second in the country in rushing yards per game by a quarterback
(90.7 yards per game), and the Eagles were 15th nationally in rushing yardage
(254.7).

Addazio had been a devotee of option football -- the wishbone in particular --
even before Notre Dame and his visit to Statesboro. In his first coaching job,
at Western Connecticut State in the mid-'80s, theteamranthewishbone.He stuck
with it when he took a high school coaching job, and his team set the
Connecticut state record with 49 consecutive wins.

"I love the offense," Addazio said. "Like, I love that offense."

(Addazio is an easily enthused person.)

To counter the Yellow Jackets, Boston College began preparing for Tech's offense
in the spring. Addazio ran the scout-team offense, and made the unusual decision
to draft offensive starters to the unit to give the Eagles defense the best
portrayal possible of what it will see in Dublin's Aviva Stadium. (Addazio calls
the Tech scout team "my baby.")

"We're going to make sure that we're going to simulate the speed of how they
play," Addazio said.

The season opener in Dublin portends to hinge on what Tech games often do, how
well the opponent coaches can prepare their defense for the Jackets' offense.

EAGER TO MAKE AN IMPACT;
MATT CANADA AND ZACH AZZANNI ARE EXCITED TO PUT THEIR SPINS ON TRADITIONAL UW
FOOTBALL.

When Matt Canada was in his first coaching stint at Northern Illinois, he
recruited the state of Wisconsin.

Canada got a close look at the kind of football players that fueled the
University of Wisconsin football program's resurgence under Barry Alvarez in the
1990s.

So, nobody has to introduce UW's new offensive coordinator to the team's
preferred style of offense, which has continued under current coach Bret
Bielema.

"Where we were at at Northern Illinois, we were building a program from not
much," Canada said. "Not saying it was exactly what coach Alvarez did, but it
was similar.

"The players that were here in this state, the linemen, the tight ends, the
things we could go get, the unbelievable following from the high school coaches
and all of the people here, you saw that and you saw everything that was great
about the place."

Not only did Canada get a glimpse of what makes this place tick, it quickly
became a destination coaching job for him.

"This isn't recruiting talk, this is a place - you can call my best friends, you
can call anybody you want - I wanted to be," Canada said. "So, that part is
awesome."

Canada and new wide receivers coach Zach Azzanni were introduced to the media on
Wednesday and the similarities were striking.

Both were exuberant about their opportunities, engaging in sharing their
personal stories and quick to embrace the physical, power running offense that
has become the Badgers' trademark.

The fact both coaches have extensive backgrounds working in spread offenses
don't matter to them.

"There's no question about the philosophy of Wisconsin, and certainly the
offensive philosophy of Wisconsin," Canada said. "I'm just joining and being
part of that philosophy."

Canada was the offensive coordinator at Northern Illinois for a pro-style
offense in 2003 when Michael Turner, now with the Atlanta Falcons, rushed for
1,648 yards. The Huskies ran the ball 508 times that season and attempted 350
passes, finishing 10-2.

This past season, he was the offensive coordinator for NIU's no-huddle spread
attack, which featured quarterback Chandler Harnish as the leading passer (3,216
yards) and rusher (1,379) for a team that went 11-3.

In between, he spent seven years at Indiana, also in a spread offense.

Azzanni spent his entire career working in spread offenses until becoming the
offensive coordinator at Western Kentucky last season. That exposure to a
pro-style offense - Hilltoppers coach Willie Taggart installed the offense he
had been in under Jim Harbaugh at Stanford - not only helped Azzanni land a job
with the Badgers, it gave him a deeper appreciation of that brand of football.

"At first, I didn't know what to think of it," Azzanni said. "I was just a
little unsure. Then, all of a sudden, we started really pounding people, kind of
taking the will from other teams and I kind of got excited about it."

While the Badgers won't be changing their basic offensive philosophy, Canada
will be free to make his own imprint, including his own terminology and
playbook.

Tight ends coach Joe Rudolph was the fourth Badgers offensive assistant to
depart in the offseason, joining former UW offensive coordinator Paul Chryst at
Pittsburgh. That was the point Bielema realized he could no longer continue with
the Chryst playbook.

"When you bring four new (offensive) coaches in, you don't put that notebook
down on the table and say, 'Run this,' " Bielema said. "We know what we want,
we've had a lot of conversations, Matt and I especially, about what we want
moving forward. ...

"The verbiage might change, the terminology might change. You want, obviously,
the production emphasis to continue to move forward."

The biggest question going into next season is an unsettled quarterback
position, with no established frontrunner.

"We're going to find the best way to maximize our talent," Canada said. "I think
that's our job, to put our players in positions to make plays.

"Whatever our strengths are is what we're going to do. That's what we've always
done and that's what we'll do with our quarterbacks."

When Canada was asked about his offensive philosophy, he said, "Score points.
That's probably silly but it's true."

The new offensive coaches have their work cut out for them in that regard, given
the Badgers set school records in scoring the past two seasons, averaging 41.5
points in 2010 and 44.1 in '11.

"I think the pressure is for us to be great every day," Canada said of following
Chryst. "That's the pressure we're going to put on ourselves."

Watch the Holiday Bowl for Anae, Tech's offense

BYLINE: Dick Harmon Deseret Morning News

LENGTH: 1359 words


SAN DIEGO -- Robert Anae can give folks back in Utah a list of reasons to watch
the Holiday Bowl tonight. It's the 20th anniversary of BYU's victory over
Michigan that led to a mythical national championship.

Anae and 42 Cougar teammates are on hand to remember and be honored as guests of
the bowl. While his former teammates are on vacation, Anae is working the
sidelines. Also a point of interest around these parts is a peek at the Texas
Tech's offense, of which Anae is the line coach. It may be a preview of what
Anae will install in Provo now that he's the new offensive coordinator.

But Anae's first duty is to do everything he can to help 7-4 Texas Tech defeat
10-1 California, a team that should have been in a BCS bowl this weekend.
Oddsmakers predict Cal will win by more than 11 points.

Anae hopes the Red Raiders from the Big 12 will display the precision that won
them the 2004 NCAA passing title, averaging 388.7 yards passing per game.

It is a spread offense that hung 70 points on both Nebraska and TCU this past
season.

It is an offense Red Raider's head coach Mike Leach, a former BYU student,
helped former Valdosta State coach Hal Mumme install, then carry to Kentucky for
quarterback Tim Couch. Leach then took it with him to Oklahoma and quarterback
Josh Heupel. Mumme used to hang around BYU spring football in the '80s, and
that's where he met Leach.

It is an offense, in a yet-to-be tweaked and adapted form, that will become the
future at BYU. In a sense, Cougar football will return to its roots but in a
high-tech, Playstation, 21st-century kind of way.

Say what?

Simply put by Anae, what he intends for BYU is not Playstation, a label Leach
has caught in Lubbock. Anae envisions an offense based on what he labeled
"effort and precision rather than genius."

It is an offense called Playstation, because of its gaudy numbers posted in pass
attempts, completions, yards and points. Blockers take wide gaps, and formations
go from sideline to sideline.

Again, Anae believes it's more than formations.

"It's been begged and borrowed from a lot of places," Leach said. "A lot is
similar to Kentucky, kind of borrowed from the West Coast offense ideas like
from BYU when they were throwing it a lot and the run-and-shoot people like
Mouse Davis back in the day. Then we've put in any plays that we felt attacked
the field and got the ball into everybody's hands without being too
complicated."

Anae says its origin is definitely BYU with Doug Scovil and Norm Chow but taken
beyond Provo the past decade. "The terminology has changed but the concepts are
there."

Red Raider receiver Jarrett Hicks, whose receiving yards surpassed 1,000 caught
this season, told the New York Times: "People think our system is so intricate
and detailed. But it's really simple. We stress making routine plays and
executing the basic things. It's the little stuff like the route running that
makes the offense go.

"For me, I came from a high school where we ran the option all day, so to be
able to come out there and catch all kinds of balls, I feel like a little kid in
a candy store right now."

Here's Anae on what he intends for BYU's offense, structured after the Red
Raider attack that will be seen today in Qualcomm Stadium.

OFFENSIVE LINE: "No question this is where it all begins. They need to play
well, and if they are tough guys and aggressive, bring on that identity, then
the skill guys start marching with confidence and toughness, too. That is an
explosive combination. We tapped into that at Tech and will at BYU.

THE RUNNING BACK: It is no secret BYU's Curtis Brown wondered what he'd be in
for when Bronco Mendenhall announced Anae and the Red Raider attack was coming.
But the offense centers on the running back and what he forces a defense to
respect. Tech's leading scorer and receiver (catches per game) is the running
back, Taurean Henderson, with nearly 11 points a game.

"The running back gets the most touches after the quarterback and center," said
the coach. "But it is an offense that must distribute the ball to everyone to be
effective. About 34 percent of the offense is the running back and the other 66
percent is to four receivers and tight ends. The key is distribution, spreading
a defense, not letting them crowd into the box. This opens it up for a back to
run. Nobody knew Oklahoma's Quentin Griffin until Mike Leach came in and spread
the field, and then Griffin started running wild.

"If you stretch a defense, the pressure of the multiple attack on a defense goes
from sideline to sideline. The more you distribute, the more they have to
respect and cover."

THE QUARTERBACK: "He is mostly distributing the ball in Mike Leach's offense,"
Anae said.

It's like a postman. Tech's quarterback, Sonny Cumbie, ranked 29th in pass
efficiency (136.83) but led the nation in total offense, averaging 369 yards a
game.

"What I'll have at BYU is an equal distribution to the four receivers with a
heavy emphasis on the back. Installing the Tech offense isn't a straight move to
BYU. It's a unique blend, and not every iota will be carried over. There is
always a change, based on what you have and what you can do."

One thing for certain, MWC defenses are hardly as tough as those in the Big 12,
a thought to keep in mind when comparing statistics and even looking at Tech
against Cal. Another thing about tonight's game, if high execution is key, a
layoff could affect the Tech offense like it has bowling BYU teams. In the 1984
Holiday Bowl win over Michigan, BYU turned the ball over half a dozen times --
the worst execution of the year.

"I don't know if (Big 12 defenses) are the best, but they'd have to be
considered when you talk about the best. We've seen some pretty stiff defenses
in the conference," Anae said.

Anae doesn't see his move as Tech's O-line coach to BYU's offensive coordinator
as a huge challenge for him to fret over. "It's more of a necessity (things to
do) than a coaching challenge" and new title.

The key to adapting Texas Tech's offense to BYU?

It will be back to basics taught by Scovil and Chow for Anae in Provo. He
preaches it every day in Lubbock: Effort and attention to detail.

In other words, receivers who drop passes in practice won't be dropping them in
games because they'll be replaced by somebody who does it in practice.

Back at BYU circa 1980, a dropped pass was a big, big thing in practice.

"It's related to tempo and effort," Anae said. "The whole offense is geared
around a high, fast-paced effort with the basics the key. It is effort related
from blocking and ball security and ball catches.

"The challenge is to coach BYU's players into getting used to a high-effort
approach and pace; to get them to take that right now, carry it to offseason
workouts, then to spring drills, summer workouts and fall camp and then to the
first game. That is the biggest challenge, not installing the offense. It's
something they haven't been used to doing."

Anae said he sees that approach already on the other side with head coach
Mendenhall.

"That approach has been there on defense, but we're going to bring it to offense
and I'm very excited. The effort is in the little things, the details from the
center delivery, whether out of the shotgun or underneath center to the QB, to
blockers, to the quarterbacks and receivers. Effort is in perfecting the small
details. Every detail will be reviewed, evaluated and taught based on effort."

Said Anae, when it comes to detail, nothing in his practices will be overlooked.

"Everything we do in practice is important. You work your practices to the point
where it becomes routine on Saturdays -- you focus on high effort, minuscule
detail in practice, and when it comes game time, you keep players loose and let
them play in a routine manner in a game. But the real effort, commitment come
from players in practice performance."

In conclusion, today Anae returns to a field he and his Cougar mates finished
13-0 against Michigan Dec. 21, 1984, 20 years ago on his 25th birthday.
Tomorrow, Anae will say goodbye to Tech and return to BYU to preach the basics
that led the Cougar program to that win over Michigan.

Will it work?

Watch Holiday Bowl for Anae, Tech's offense

DeKalb officer charged in rape of 6-year-old
A33-year-old DeKalb County police officer was arrested Wednesday and charged
with rape and child molestation in a case involving a 6-year-old girl.

Timothy H. Turner of Decatur, who had been with the DeKalb department since
April 4, 1999, resigned his position at the time of his arrest, police said.

Turner is being held at the DeKalb County Jail on one count of rape and three
counts of child molestation.

According to the arrest warrant, the incidents occurred between July and
September.

Turner faces a preliminary hearing Oct. 19 at 2:30 p.m.

EAST POINT: Car driver charged in death of motorcyclist
A 28-year-old motorcyclist was killed Thursday afternoon in a crash on Camp
Creek Parkway at I-285. East Point police Capt. Pat Price said a woman driving a
Cadillac turned in front of the motorcyclist and his Yamaha ran into the side of
the car. He was thrown off the bike and died at Grady Memorial Hospital. The
woman was hospitalized for shock and was charged with failure to yield and
vehicular homicide, Price said. Price did not release the names of the dead man
or the driver of the car.

ATLANTA: Falling ceiling at Macy's mistaken for explosion
That was not an explosion at the downtown Macy's department store Thursday. It
was a falling ceiling, and no one was injured. Part of a ceiling on the sixth
floor collapsed about noon, sending chunks of the ceiling through a window.
Plaster and glass rained onto the Peachtree Street side of the store. At first,
911 callers reported an explosion. Fire crews checked it out and found
renovation work on the upper floors of the department store was to blame, said
Atlanta firefighter Andre Owens.

HALL COUNTY: Hiding information is alleged in death
A Winder man has been charged with concealing information in the death of
Barbara Ann Langford, whose burned body was found in Alabama on Sept. 1. Robert
Phylatus Smith III, 50, was charged with the felony in Hall County Wednesday.
Police said Smith was an acquaintance of Langford's boyfriend, who is wanted for
questioning in her death. Smith knew details of Langford's disappearance and
death but didn't report them, said Capt. Murray Kogod, a spokesman for the Hall
County Sheriff's Department. Smith remained in the Hall County Jail on Thursday.
Langford, 44, was last seen in her hometown of Winder in late August. Police
have said she was shot in the neck in Georgia, possibly in Hall County, and
taken to a roadside near Collinsville, Ala., where her body was burned.

FAYETTE COUNTY: Gas line rupture closes some lanes of Ga. 74
The northbound lanes of Ga. 74 in Tyrone were closed for about an hour Thursday
after a road construction crew ruptured a 4-inch gas line. There were no
evacuations and no injuries. Northbound CSX trains were temporarily stopped as a
precaution, said Capt. Pete Nelms of Fayette County Fire and Emergency Services.
The gas leak at Ga. 74 and Jenkins Road was capped about 3:25 p.m., Nelms said.

HART, FRANKLIN COUNTIES: $ 50,000 confiscated at video poker shop
Law enforcement officers who raided 24 video poker shops in Hart and Franklin
counties Wednesday confiscated $ 50,000 in cash from one of the places, GBI
spokesman John Bankhead reported Thursday.
Some amount of cash was seized from the tills and safes of every one of the
shops, Bankhead said, but it has not been totaled yet. On Thursday agents were
removing cash from inside the 458 machines seized. That money, he said, will be
counted at a bank today. Of the 44 persons named in warrants charging commercial
gambling, 36 had been arrested by late Thursday. The remaining eight have not
yet been located, Bankhead said. Bond for all was set at $ 10, 000 each.

NO-HUDDLE OFFENSE VS. 49ERS' SHUFFLING DEFENSE

BYLINE: Jeff Gordon Of the Post-Dispatch Staff

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 3C

LENGTH: 667 words


SIXTH IN A SERIES (REST) Matchup: The Cincinnati Bengals are the only National
Football League team to use a no-huddle offense at various points of all four
quarters.  They do it for three reasons: to speed up their offense and catch
defenders on their heels, to prevent teams from bringing in pass-defense
specialists, and to catch teams in mid-substitution. That creates penalties for
too many men on the field.  The 49ers rely heavily on situation substitutions
and have one of the NFL's better ''nickel,'' or passing-down defenses. They use
pass-rushing and coverage specialists and remove defenders whose main strength
is run defense.  Strategy: On second and third downs in long yardage situations,
the Bengals like to use their ''sugar'' huddle. The linemen take their positions
and the running backs and receivers stand within barking distance of quarterback
Boomer Esiason and await coded oral commands.  Some of the commands are
jibberish, used to amuse themselves and confuse the enemy. Some of the commands
are real. They change from game to game.  The Bengals like to line up and snap
the ball while the opposition still is mulling over substitutions. Normally the
49ers used a 3-4 defensive front.  Then they go to a 4-1-6 set, with pass
rushers Pierce Holt and Dan Stubbs subbing for linemen Michael Carter and Kevin
Fagan.  On third-and-long, the 49ers will bring in a seventh defensive back for
a linebacker.  Against the no-huddle, the 49ers have two choices: leave the
original players on the field, forcing them to play different roles in long
yardage, or fake injuries, as Seattle and Buffalo did to stop play and get
substitute players on the field. Given the 49ers' dependence on situation
substitutions, the Bengals are almost certain to make extensive use of their
no-huddle offense.  By The Numbers: The Bengals' season-long tendency is to use
the no-huddle offense on 15 to 20 percent of their plays.  Comments: Esiason:
''It's fun. It picks up the pace, and it drives people crazy. That's what I live
for. It's like playing the Georgetown Hoyas.  Remember the Bears three years
ago? They pressured you with the 46 defense.  Well, we do the same thing, only
it's on offense.'' Bengals offensive coordinator Bruce Coslet: ''Boomer is like
a gunslinger, and he wants things up-tempo. If you put him in a set offense,
it's like putting Magic Johnson in a set offense. They do better almost
ad-libbing.  Creating. Making things happen.'' San Francisco defensive
coordinator George Seifert: ''It dictates to the defense. We don't relish the
idea of the offense dictating to us. We like to do it the other way around. It
does restrict some of the things we can do and it will limit some of the
substitutions.''

Kizer's skills blend well with system

BYLINE: TYLER JAMES, South Bend Tribune

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. B1

LENGTH: 835 words


DeShone Kizer found a fit at Notre Dame.

But when the four-star quarterback makes his way to South Bend next summer, the
question will be how Kizer fits in the Irish spread offense.

On paper and on film, Kizer brings a number of qualities that can excel in an
offense designed by Brian Kelly. The 6-foot-4, 215-pound possesses the height to
sit in the pocket and pick apart secondaries, but also has the athleticism to
stretch the pocket and make plays with his legs.

Kelly has shown an affinity for dual-threat quarterbacks at Notre Dame. Everett
Golson was given the reins as a redshirt freshman in 2012 in part because of his
play-making ability. The Irish picked another dual-threat quarterback in the
2013 recruiting class with freshman Malik Zaire.

A dual-threat quarterback isn't a necessity in the spread offense, but Kelly has
certainly established that trend. That's why CBS Sports Network recruiting
analyst Tom Lemming saw a potential match with Kizer and Notre Dame before the
quarterback committed.

"He has that skill set that you want in a spread offense quarterback that can
throw on the run and can tuck and run when he gets forced out," Lemming said.
"He's got the intangibles that I think Notre Dame's looking for."

Kizer runs a variation of the spread offense at Toledo Central Catholic, which
won the Division II state championship in Ohio last season.

"We run a lot of the same concepts," Kizer said. "Notre Dame is a school that
can come out and run a pro-style offense for you and they can also run a spread
offense for you. I believe at my school I do the same thing. We can come out in
a drive and do nothing but double tights, power it up the gut, run some
play-action and all pro-style stuff. But we can also come out and spread you out
with five wide. Notre Dame does one of the best jobs in the world of doing
that."

Despite growing up in a family of Michigan fans, Kizer kept a close eye on the
Irish during the 2012 season. As a part of a recruiting visit to Michigan State
last September, Kizer watched the Irish beat the Spartans 20-3 in East Lansing.
He came away impressed with Notre Dame's style of play that led the team to a
national championship appearance.

"Sitting down and watching some film of their offense really showed me that
that's the style of offense I want to have. A lot of the calls and a lot of the
checks are all run through the quarterback," Kizer said. "They give you a lot of
power out there. I believe that's exactly what I want to do when I'm in college.
There's no better offense that I can run than what Notre Dame has."

Battling with Kentucky

Not known as a power in the Southeastern Conference, the University of Kentucky
football program has found success on the recruiting trail this offseason since
hiring Mike Stoops as head coach.

Despite a 2-10 record last season, the Wildcats have started the 2014 cycle
strong and collected a class of 15 verbal commitments that ranks as No. 5 on
Rivals.com and No. 7 on 247Sports.com.

On Monday, defensive back Darius West, who recently received an offer to Notre
Dame, committed to the Wildcats. The 6-0, 195-pound recruit from Lima (Ohio)
Central Catholic picked Kentucky before making a planned visit to Notre Dame
later in June.

The Irish and Wildcats historically don't compete for the same recruits, but
Stoops has claimed eight verbal commitments from the talent-rich state of Ohio
that Notre Dame has repeatedly mined for players.

The Irish made another shared target with Kentucky on Tuesday when safeties
coach Bob Elliott extended an offer to defensive tackle Matt Elam.. The 6-6,
340-pound rising senior from Elizabethtown, Ky., said he hadn't heard from the
Notre Dame coach at all until Elliott reached out to offer.

One of the top prospects in the Bluegrass State, Elam ranks as the No. 20
defensive tackle according to 247Sports and No. 24 according to Rivals.

Elam said the offer from Notre Dame put the Irish in his top five which also
includes Kentucky, Ohio State, Alabama and Louisville.

Defensive line visitors

As the Irish continue to look to fill the void that was meant to be filled by
Eddie Vanderdoes in the 2013 class, the coaching staff has been able to raise
interest in multiple defensive lineman in the 2014 class.

On Monday, defensive end Solomon Thomas made a visit to Notre Dame's campus. The
four-star prospect from Coppell, Texas, made the trip following the Rivals 100
Challenge in Chicago over the weekend.

The 6-3, 256-pound Thomas ranks as a top five strongside defensive end according
to both Rivals and 247Sports and a top 40 recruit overall.

Another top defensive line target, Thomas Holley, plans to visit later in June.
The 6-4, 290-pound prospect from Brooklyn, N.Y., attends the same high school,
Lincoln, as Irish linebacker Ishaq Williams.

Holley ranks as the No. 4 defensive tackle and No. 84 overall, according to
Rivals. 247Sports slates Holley as the No. 9 defensive tackle and No. 70
overall.

Aggies reach agreement with Dunbar

BYLINE: By Teddy Feinberg Sun-News Sports Editor

SECTION: SPORTS

LENGTH: 491 words


LAS CRUCES The New Mexico State Aggie football team has reached an agreement
with Mike Dunbar to become the team's new offensive coordinator, head coach
DeWayne Walker announced Wednesday evening.

Dunbar, who brings more than 25 years of coaching experience to NMSU, last
worked at the University of Minnesota in the 2008 season.

"I'm excited for the opportunity to be the next offensive coordinator at New
Mexico State," Dunbar said. "I look forward to working with Coach Walker, the
staff and student-athletes to continue to build this football team into a
successful program."

Dunbar previously held the assistant head coach/offensive coordinator position
at Minnesota (2007-08). He has had previous stops at Central Washington
University (head coach, 1987-91), Toledo (offensive coordinator, 1992-96),
Northern Iowa (head coach, 1997-2000), Northwestern (tight ends, special teams,
2001; offensive coordinator, 2002-05) and California (offensive coordinator,
2006).

"I think Dunbar will bring some creativity to our offense," Walker said. "With
his experience, I feel confident that he will have seen almost everything
opposing defenses will throw at him and I think with his experience, he will be
able to adjust and put points on the board to help us be competitive in this
conference."

Dunbar was one of five candidates who interviewed for the NMSU offensive
coordinator position. The others were Feather River College head coach Steve
Mooshagian, Nebraska Kearney offensive coordinator Russ Martin, UNLV offensive
coordinator Rob Phenicie and Idaho quarterbacks coach Jonathan Smith.

NMSU parted ways with former offensive coordinator Timm Rosenbach following last
season, after the Aggie offense struggled to gain traction, finishing last in
the NCAA in scoring offense.

Dunbar, who runs his system out of a spread formation, has led some high-powered
offenses during his career.

In 2007, his Golden Gophers offense set a school record for pass completions in
a season (262) and had the second-most passing yards in school history (2,949).

While at Cal, Dunbar's Bears' offense ranked 12th in the nation in total offense
and was in the top-35 in the country in passing offense (17th) and rushing
offense (33). The Bears averaged 32.8-points-per game in 2006.

Other highlights from Dunbar's career include tutoring Northwestern quarterback
Brett Basanez, as the Wildcats finished fourth in the nation in total offense in
2005, as well as guiding Toledo to 21 offensive records in 1995.

Brought to the University of Minnesota prior to the 2007 season with new head
coach Tim Brewster, Dunbar resigned following the 2008 campaign when the team
signaled a change of course in its offensive philosophy, moving from the spread
attack to a more power-running-based scheme.

NMSU's agreement with Dunbar is believed to be comparable to Rosenbach's $70,000
annual figure from a season ago.

Buckling Up, Or Not, State by State

SECTION: OUTLOOK; Pg. B04

LENGTH: 429 words


Last week, a bill to make it a "primary" offense to drive in Virginia without
wearing a seat belt once again crashed and burned in a House of Delegates
committee. Failure to buckle up will thus likely remain a "secondary" offense in
the commonwealth, meaning drivers can be ticketed for it only if they have
already been pulled over for another violation.

What's the law elsewhere? Virginians may be surprised to learn that they are in
the majority when it comes to seat-belt laws. While 49 states (the holdout being
New Hampshire) plus the District of Columbia make seat-belt use mandatory, only
19 of those jurisdictions make noncompliance a primary offense: Alabama,
California, Connecticut, the District, Georgia, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa,
Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina,
Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas and Washington.

That's not the only variation. Just 16 jurisdictions extend their laws to cover
rear-seat as well as front-seat occupants. Interestingly, though, 10 of them
(Alaska, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Montana, Nevada, Rhode Island, Utah,
Vermont and Wyoming) are not on the list of primary-offense enforcers. Only
California, the District, New Mexico, New York, Oregon and Washington really
want to ensure that the whole carload belts up.

The obvious question is whether jurisdictions that make it a primary offense not
to buckle up have lower traffic fatality rates than their more lax counterparts.
While state-by-state comparisons are complicated by other factors, from the age
of the population to the type and condition of the roads, 2001 data compiled by
the National Safety Council indicate that the 18 states with primary seat-belt
laws have slightly lower death rates than the 31 states with secondary laws:
1.47 fatalities per 100 million miles driven compared with 1.64 deaths per 100
million miles driven. (The District was not included in the council's data.)

Here's another way of looking at it. It has been estimated that 77 percent of
drivers in primary-enforcement states wear their seat belts, compared with 60
percent in states that turn a blind eye. And, says the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration, three-point seat belts reduce the likelihood of death in
a passenger-car crash by 45 percent, 60 percent if a light truck is involved.

Think about that, Virginia.

Quarterback Cardale Jones and the top-ranked Buckeyes are averaging just 411
yards a game, which ranks them 75th in the country in total offense.

COLUMBUS - Ohio State fans with their finger on the panic button will stomp on
it with two feet if the Buckeye offense can't fix its problems today against
Western Michigan.

The Broncos, the second Mid-American Conference team in a row to visit Ohio
Stadium, rank 93rd in the country in total defense (413 yards per game) and
103rd in scoring defense (33.3 points per game). Michigan State beat Western
Michigan 37-24 in the season opener for both teams.

This is a game No. 1 Ohio State doesn't lose. It improved to 31-1 against the
MAC with a 20-13 victory against Northern Illinois last week. The only questions
are:

? How lopsided will the score be?

? Will Ohio State's stumbling, fumbling offense get on track?

? Will the quarterback saga continue? Or will Cardale Jones finally seize the
job?

"In practice this week, you can kind of tell there is a change of attitude,"
center Jacoby Boren said. "It's kind of come to a head with everybody on the
offense. We're kind of (angry) with the way we've been playing. It's time for us
to run the Buckeye offense we've known the past couple of years."

After losing to Michigan State (37-24) and Georgia Southern (43-17) in their
first two games, the Broncos bounced back with a 52-20 victory against Murray
State last Saturday.

Quarterback Zach Terrell completed 25 of 30 passes for 355 yards with four TDs.
Running back Jarvion Franklin gained 161 yards on 27 carries.

Wide receiver Daniel Braverman caught 14 passes for 167 yards and two scores. He
ranks sixth in the nation in receiving yards (132.7 per game).

"A lot of it gets back to their scheme," said Ohio State co-defensive
coordinator Chris Ash. "They put him in position to get a lot of free-access
throws where people aren't challenging him very much because of where he's at. A
lot of it's bubble screens off the play action where they're getting outside
linebackers sucked up and getting the ball to him in space. He's got good
ability to run with the ball after he makes the catch and avoids contact and
makes people miss out in space."

While everyone expects Ohio State's defense to shut down the Broncos, no one
quite knows what to expect from Ohio State's offense.

The Buckeyes rank 75th in the country in total offense (411 yards per game) and
are tied for 51st in scoring offense (33.3 points per game). Last season, Ohio
State averaged 44.8 points and 511.6 yards per game.

Coach Urban Meyer promised a better performance in a speech to the team after
the offense produced one touchdown against Northern Illinois.

"He said it's not going to happen again," cornerback Eli Apple said. "He said
he's going to make a promise that he's going to do anything in his power to help
the offense. We're going to expect a lot more from the offense for sure."

MURRAY'S REPLACEMENT DOESN'T WASTE ANY TIME

BYLINE:  Rachel G. Bowers  Morris News Service

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. C1

LENGTH: 504 words

DATELINE: ATHENS, Ga.


The last time Hutson Mason started at quarterback, he was guiding Lassiter's
up-tempo, no-huddle offense as a senior in high school.

That was four years ago and old habits die hard, as fans will discover when
Mason leads Georgia against Georgia Tech on Saturday in Atlanta.

"The offensive line knows that I like to keep things going a little quick," said
Mason said, who is taking over for the injured Aaron Murray.

"It's not like Oregon, but I just have a tendency from playing at Lassiter (in
Marietta) where we were up-tempo and no-huddle offense, so just by my nature I'm
a little faster than Aaron."

Georgia isn't up-tempo in its pro-style offense, though it can shift into that
gear as its shown this season in game-winning drives against Louisiana State and
Tennessee. It can also eat clock, like it did in the final eight minutes against
South Carolina and Florida.

But the Bulldogs were being keyed by Murray in all four of those situations and
now the first-team offense has to gel with Mason's style and vice versa.

"They're kind of the same," tailback Todd Gurley said. "Hutson's kind of faster
of a pace. Whatever happens, he's going to go out there and just try to make a
play. Aaron's more patient with it."

In Murray's 52 starts, dating back to the 2010 season, Georgia has averaged 68.2
plays per game. That's right between the number of plays Alabama (63) and the
quicker Auburn (71) have been getting off each game so far this season. Oregon
trumps them all, snapping the ball 78 times a game this season.

Wide receiver Chris Con-ley said the offense can easily adjust to Mason's tempo
through more reps. He said it adds another dimension to Georgia's offense, which
should be back to 100 percent at the start of next season with the return of
tailback Keith Marshall and receivers Justin Scott-Wesley and Malcolm Mitchell.

"The fact that Hutson likes it and he's good at it is all the more reason why
we're probably going to be doing more of that," Conley said. "We brought the
no-huddle into this offense a couple years ago to get teams off balance and it's
really worked because of the personnel that we have and their ability not only
to recover but to make plays downfield and continue to make plays at a rapid
pace. The fact that we have the people to do it, yeah, I can see that
happening."

Not so fast, said offensive coordinator Mike Bobo, whose play-calling has helped
the Bulldogs to average nearly 38 points an outing despite being without key
starters.

Bobo likes being able to control the tempo and changing the tempo to best suit
the game situation.

"He's maybe a little faster than Aaron is in practice and that might be just a
little bit of his background and Lassiter," Bobo said.

"We'll still control the tempo that will give us the best chance to win the ball
game."

Conley said the biggest thing the Bulldogs would have to learn to do going
up-tempo under Mason's guidance would be forgetting the last play - good or bad
- and getting back to the line of scrimmage as fast as possible for the next
play.

PRO FOOTBALL;
High-Scoring B.Y.U. Reaches Top 10

BYLINE:  By CHARLIE NOBLES

SECTION: Section D; Column 4; Sports Desk; Pg. 6

LENGTH: 818 words


LaVell Edwards, who was known as an offense-minded coach, relinquished his
29-year hold on the Brigham Young job after last season. Enter Gary Crowton, who
is making Edwards look as if he had run the single wing.

Crowton, the 44-year-old former Chicago Bears offensive coordinator and
Louisiana Tech head coach, has considerably expanded the Cougars' playbook. They
now have 100-plus plays they can run from 23 formations.

Nobody has been able to throttle the B.Y.U. offense as the Cougars have begun
the season 9-0. They are averaging 50.8 points a game, which is first
nationally, and 550.1 yards a game, which is second. "I've got more versatility
with the athletes here than I've ever had," Crowton said. "It's given me as a
play-caller the opportunity to hit different areas."

Still, playing in the lightly regarded Mountain West Conference, B.Y.U. has been
on a season-long search for respect. The Cougars are making some headway.
Brigham Young moved up three spots to No. 10 this week in The New York Times's
computer ranking after beating Colorado State, 56-34. It is also ranked ninth in
the Associated Press and USA Today/ESPN polls.

Nebraska (10-0) retained the No. 1 position in The Times's ranking, with Miami
(7-0) second and Tennessee (6-1) third, followed by Texas and Oklahoma, both
8-1. Oregon (8-1) leapt from 12th to a tie for sixth with Syracuse (7-2).

Though it is unbeaten, B.Y.U. has distinct Jekyll and Hyde personalities on
offense and defense.

B.Y.U.'s offense has been inside the opposition's 20-yard line on 51 occasions
and has cashed in with 41 touchdowns and 5 field goals. Crowton has frequently
confused the opposition with a variety of formations.

Steve Young, a former B.Y.U. quarterback who is now an N.F.L. analyst for ESPN,
said Crowton reminded him of Denver Broncos Coach Mike Shanahan.

"He's like, 'We're going to kill these guys,' " Young said. "Not, 'We're going
to try and grind it out and win, 17-14.' This offense looks like an upgrade from
our offense that's been killing people for the last 15 years."

B.Y.U.'s offense has so excelled that it has two Heisman Trophy candidates. They
are the senior quarterback Brandon Doman, who has thrown 23 touchdown passes
against 3 interceptions and whose efficiency rating is the country's second
best. The other is the junior running back Luke Staley, who is averaging 9.1
yards a carry and 136.5 a game and has scored 22 touchdowns.

Conversely, the Cougars' defense has been absurdly friendly to the opposition,
allowing 25.7 points a game. Opponents, like Air Force and San Diego State, have
averaged 232 yards a game rushing.

Colorado State ran for 440 yards. Air Force, which benefited from the Cougars'
liberal substitution after they achieved a 63-13 lead in a 63-33 victory, rushed
for 334.

B.Y.U. often scores so quickly that its defense finds itself in an endurance
test, which is not good for a unit short of depth in the line. The offense has
had 11 scoring drives of less than a minute and 32 of less than two minutes.

Yet, that does not fully explain the defense's problem. "We have quality
athletes over there," center Jason Scukanee said. "I don't have the answers.
Sometimes they show up; sometimes they struggle."

What remains constant, though, is winning. Doman, a former high school option
quarterback who has had stints at wide receiver and defensive back at B.Y.U.,
has thrived at quarterback under Crowton. Tack on two victories that predated
Crowton and Doman is 11-0 as a starter, the best streak of any B.Y.U.
quarterback since Robbie Bosco in 1984.

San Diego State Coach Ted Tollner seemed convinced of B.Y.U.'s merit after his
team was overwhelmed, 59-21. "You may walk away and say, 'Well, they didn't do
this or that,' " he said. "Well, they did a whole bunch of things to score
50-some points."

Crowton, who coached in the Big East at Boston College and in the Atlantic Coast
Conference at Georgia Tech, said that he had a reasonable feel for the talent
level around the country and that the Cougars should not be penalized for
playing in the Mountain West.

"We have good depth in our conference, maybe more so from top to bottom than in
some other conferences," he said. "I'm not complaining about where we're at --
I've just always been for a playoff system. How does anybody know really how
good we are? We've beaten almost everybody so decisively."

In the two games that were not blowouts -- a 35-31 victory over Nevada-Las Vegas
and a 24-20 victory over New Mexico -- Crowton said Doman played with a shoulder
separation, and in one of them, the Cougars had to use a third-string tailback.

The road to an unbeaten season still looks bumpy. Wyoming this week does not
figure to offer much resistance, but next week Utah (6-2), which moved up to
13th in The Times's ranking, represents a major challenge. Especially since it
is a home game for B.Y.U., which has not beaten Utah at home in a decade.

Raiders offense shows some life

BYLINE: Contra Costa Times

LENGTH: 784 words


OAKLAND -- THE LANE KIFFIN era began Saturday night for the Raiders with
back-to-back three-and-outs by his offense and quarterback Josh McCown.

The results looked all-too-familiar for a team that went 2-14 last season and
set offense back 100 years, give or take a decade.

But this didn't: McCown wasn't sacked or even knocked down on any of his five
passes on those drives.

McCown got rid of the ball quickly, firing passes to receivers running short and
intermediate-length patterns.

My first thought? Kiffin's attack actually looked like a modern NFL offense, not
some relic from the 1960s or '70s that we watched last season under Art Shell
and offensive coordinator Tom Walsh.

Kiffin's offense against the Arizona Cardinals had plenty of quick passes,
straight out of the West Coast playbook. Plenty of plays designed to move the
ball in small and mid-sized chunks and keep his quarterback upright and in one
piece, and a few plays drawn up to strike deep.

And the running game? It was basically pilfered or borrowed from the Denver
Broncos' and Tampa Bay Buccaneers' playbooks.

The Raiders scrapped Shell's one-on-one, power-blocking scheme. Enter new
offensive line coach Tom Cable and a zone blocking scheme -- complete with cut
blocks -- that the Broncos and Bucs have used to rack up huge rushing numbers.

I think it's safe to say we can welcome the Raiders offense back to the 21st
century.

Al Davis hired Kiffin in January -- at the age of 31 and with no head-coaching
experience at any level -- to fix the archaic disaster of an offense that cost
Shell his job after one season.

Davis made Kiffin, now 32, the youngest coach in the modern NFL era because he
believed he could show the Raiders the way to the end zone again.

It will take weeks, months and possibly an entire season or more to see if
Kiffin can do what he was hired to do.

But you have to give Kiffin this much after one glorified scrimmage against
Arizona: He's off to a good start. His honeymoon should last at least another
week.

McCown played the first three series and Andrew Walter the final two in the
first half. Neither one was sacked a single time by halftime as the Raiders
built a 21-10 lead. This on a Raiders team that allowed a league-worst 72 sacks
last year.

"I really like our offense," Walter said after the Raiders' 27-23 victory. "I
like our run scheme, the zone scheme. I like some of the bootleg (passes).
Obviously we have stuff down the field, stuff underneath. Very dynamic."

McCown and Walter each led the Raiders on a long scoring drive, the type you
rarely saw last season.

On his final series, McCown conducted a 12-play, 80-yard touchdown drive, using
7:05. On his second series, Walter led the Raiders on a 14-play, 67-yard scoring
drive that took 6:50.

Last season the odds of the Raiders holding onto the ball for 12 or 14 plays
were longer than their odds of reaching the Super Bowl.

Their offense scored 12 touchdowns the entire season. It turned the ball over 46
times, more than any other team.

It was an offense designed for failure. Whereas this year, you get the feeling
Kiffin has a modern offense designed to give the Raiders a legitimate chance for
success.

"We're pleased with some things that happened early on offense," Kiffin said.
"We didn't turn the ball over and didn't give up a sack."

On his second drive, McCown hit Jerry Porter on a quick hitch to the left side
good for 5 yards, his first completion as a Raider, and Ronald Curry for a short
gain.

On his third try, McCown marched the Raiders into the end zone.

Early in the drive, the Raiders gave us a glimpse of what their new run-blocking
scheme could bring. This scheme relies as much on quickness and movement as it
does pure power. The key is to get defenders moving one direction and open up
cutback lanes the other way.

That's exactly what happened when Dominic Rhodes headed up the middle then cut
back to his right, finding a huge lane and racing 13 yards to the Raiders' 44.

Later in the drive, McCown fired a quick strike along the right sideline to
Porter, who juked a defender and gained 12 yards to the Arizona 33.

"I feel good about what we were doing offensively," McCown said. "We got into a
groove. It was good to have that long drive in there. I think it helps build
confidence. Overall, through the whole game, I thought the offense played really
well."

Two plays after McCown's pass to Porter, the Raiders hit Arizona with a
well-executed screen pass, Rhodes gaining 10 more yards. Did the Raiders ever
run a well-executed screen pass last season?

On the next play, McCown fired a 14-yard strike to Mike Williams along the left
sideline for a first down.

Moments later, the Raiders scored the first touchdown of the Kiffin era.

North Division champ Kansas State, which will play Oklahoma on Dec. 2 for the
league championship, placed six players on the All-Big 12 first team, four on
the second team and three on the third team -- 13 in all.

Four Wildcats are on the first-team offense: offensive lineman Randall Cummins,
wide receiver Quincy Morgan, placekicker Jamie Rheem and punt returner Aaron
Lockett.

Kansas State players on the first-team defense are interior lineman Mario
Fatafhi and defensive back Jerametrius Butler.

The No-Huddle Offense: Pennington Makes It Go

BYLINE: By DAVID PICKER

SECTION: Section D; Column 5; Sports Desk; PRO FOOTBALL; Pg. 5

LENGTH: 506 words

DATELINE: HEMPSTEAD, N.Y., Oct. 25


The no-huddle offense has been the hallmark of teams trying to overcome a
deficit late in games. These days, the Jets are playing most of their games like
a team without a lead and with no time to spare. And that is how Coach Eric
Mangini wants it.

In last Sunday's 31-24 victory against the Detroit Lions, the Jets did not go
into a huddle for 10 of 18 plays on their first two possessions in building a
14-0 lead. For the game, they used the no-huddle offense on 47.8 percent of
their plays that were not on fourth down.

''It worked out the way we hoped in terms of progress,'' Mangini said.

By routinely going without a huddle, quarterback Chad Pennington and the Jets'
offense have prevented defensive substitutions, tiring out defensive linemen and
making them easier to block. Many teams would surely follow suit on offense if
they could. The most integral ingredient is having a quarterback with an
exceptionally high football I.Q.

''There's an awful lot of stuff that Chad has to manage,'' guard Pete Kendall
said. ''He has to get the play call, the formation, be aware of the play clock,
everybody's alignment. Then he has to call the cadence. There's a lot of things
there that you could lose one piece or another and have a bad play. And Chad's
been very, very efficient with that this year.''

Brian Schottenheimer, the offensive coordinator, must also promptly relay the
play to Pennington. Mangini said that when Schottenheimer was the quarterbacks
coach of the Chargers the previous four seasons, San Diego randomly and
effectively used a no-huddle offense.

The no-huddle does have drawbacks. Linebacker Jonathan Vilma and wide receiver
Laveranues Coles said Wednesday that the offense had become somewhat
predictable. The Jets (4-3) play at Cleveland on Sunday, and the Browns (1-5)
will be expecting the no-huddle. Also, some of the Jets have expressed distaste
for it because it can tire out the offense, too.

The Jets regularly used the no-huddle during the preseason, one of the first
noticeable changes made by Mangini, the team's first-year coach. Three weeks
before their opener, Brooks Bollinger led the Jets on a 23-play drive that
consumed nearly 12 minutes and ended with a field goal against the Washington
Redskins. The Jets went without a huddle 12 times during the series.

Coles was asked Wednesday if he was surprised that the no-huddle was introduced
and that it had lasted so long into the regular season.

''I don't really think much around here surprises you,'' he said. ''You get a
new coach, and things change. It is what it is. They come in, they introduce
something to you; you take it and you run with it.''

EXTRA POINTS

  Laveranues Coles has not missed a game this season, but he appears weekly on
the midweek injury report. Coles was listed as questionable for Sunday's game
with a calf injury.  Eric Mangini was once an intern with the Browns. On
Wednesday, he spoke via a conference call with reporters. ''It's better to do
the conference call than set up the conference call,'' Mangini said.

Canada worse than U.S. in property crime: The most common form of crime in

Property crime is the most common form of crime in Canada, with a rate slightly
higher than in the United States.

Of the three million criminal code violations recorded in Canada in 1996, four
per cent were property offences, 11 per cent were violent crimes, seven per cent
were traffic offences such as impaired driving, and 28 per cent were other
offences such as narcotics and prostitution.

Theft under $5,000 accounts for half the property incidents reported to police.
A quarter of property offences were break-and-enters, 60 per cent of them
residential.

Canada's property crime rate (5,500 offences per 100,000 population) has
remained relatively stable since 1980 with the only significant increases in
1990 and 1991.

Property crimes and their effect on victims are often minimized or viewed
strictly from an economic angle. However, victims of property crime report
feeling that their privacy has been invaded and their sense of safety and
security decreased. Many victims continue to fear recurrence or personal harm
long after the crime, even after property has been replaced or recovered.

Research shows high levels of property crime decrease general quality of life of
a community. As noted in the Vancouver Board of Trade's 1997 study, increasing
property crime ''is a trend that saps the quality of life in Vancouver.''

The estimate of the total cost of property crime in Canada varies greatly. One
study estimated the total cost of crime at between $16.7 and $38.2 billion
annually, with property crime accounting for $4 billion to $10 billion of that
amount. The National Crime Prevention Council estimated property loss accounted
for approximately $5 billion dollars in 1996 out of a total $46 billion cost of
crime.

The average break-and-enter costs between $8,000 and $10,000. The insurance
pay-out in Canada in 1994 on break-and-enters alone was $48 million, compared to
$26 million for fire claims. Insurance companies now pay out more for
theft-related claims than for all other claims combined.

According to the Board of Trade report, Vancouver has not only been the property
crime capital of Canada for the past five years, but its crime rate has been
increasing while other major cities' rates were dropping.

In spite of the common perception of the United States as crime-ridden,
Vancouver's property crime rate was higher than that of comparable west coast
U.S. cities, including Seattle, San Diego, Portland and San Jose.

NFL Week 2: Go with Steelers' Parker, Ward

BYLINE: The Province

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. A63

LENGTH: 534  words


MASTERING THE MATCHUPS

Pittsburgh (1-0) at Jacksonville (1-0) -- This is a brutal matchup for the
sluggish Jaguars offence, so don't expect much. For Pittsburgh, I like RB Willie
Parker to eventually bust off a long run and for WR Hines Ward to reach the end
zone again.

Buffalo (0-1) at Miami (0-1) -- This is a tough spot for the young Bills, so
lower expectations. Miami RB Ronnie Brown should go off and WR Chris Chambers
went ballistic in his last game against the Bills.

Cleveland (0-1) at Cincinnati (1-0) -- It's all systems go for the Bengals
offence. The Browns will have to throw often, so TE Kellen Winslow should do
well again.

Detroit (0-1) at Chicago (1-0) -- Avoid all Lions if you can and use RB Thomas
Jones and WR Muhsin Muhammad if you need them.

Houston (0-1) at Indianapolis (1-0) -- The Colts offence should explode and the
Texans will have to keep pace, so every key player is looking good here.

N.Y. Giants (0-1) at Philadelphia (1-0) -- Points will be scored in this game,
so it's a green light for all key players.

Tampa Bay (0-1) at Atlanta (1-0) -- Bucs coach Jon Gruden will make this one
about manhood, so I expect them to pound it with the running game.

Arizona (1-0) at Seattle (1-0) -- Seattle will put a lot of points on the board
in this game and while it will be tough the Cardinals will have to keep pace, so
use all players.

Kansas City (0-1) at Denver (0-1) -- Coming off its ugly loss to St. Louis last
week, Denver should pound K.C. You have to use RB Larry Johnson and TE Tony
Gonzalez, but lower expectations.

New England (1-0) at N.Y. Jets (1-0) -- The Jets offence will struggle, while
the Patriots running game should carry the load again this week.

Washington (0-1) at Dallas (0-1) -- I would use all key players, even though
this is a tough matchup for both offences. This should be close and hard-fought,
which usually leads to solid fantasy production.

NFL Stock Watch

Upgrades

Antonio Bryant (San Francisco) -- Things are really looking up for Bryant. He's
taken on the No. 1 role very well, and he's clearly a major go-to guy in the
offence.

Braylon Edwards (Cleveland) -- For one, it's huge that he was able to start, but
that he was able to score a 74-yard TD on his first play of the season -- the
first play of the game -- certainly illustrates his potential (unfortunately,
the TD was called back).

Downgrades

Jake Delhomme (Carolina) -- This guy needs Steve Smith big-time.

Darrell Jackson (Seattle) -- He won't be the go-to guy he has been with Deion
Branch, who commands the ball, in the fold.

FANTASY TIP OF THE WEEK

Michael Turner (RB, San Diego) -- If you're in a keeper league, pick up the
Chargers RB now. He will be a restricted free agent in 2007 and the Chargers
aren't likely to retain him because he will get a big offer from another team to
be its starter. This guy is the real deal.

THIS WEEK'S HOT PICKUPS

Rating 5 Braylon Edwards (WR, Cleveland)

Rating 4 Troy Williamson (WR, Minnesota)

Rating 4 Travis Henry (RB, Tennessee)

Rating 3 Doug Gabriel (WR, New England)

Rating 3 Jerious Norwood (RB, Atlanta)

Rating 3 Jerricho Cotchery (WR, N.Y. Jets)

Rating 3 Marques Colston (WR, New Orleans)

Rating 2 Alex Smith (QB, San Francisco)

Rating 2 Samkon Gado (RB, Houston)

Aggies reach agreement with Dunbar (5:30 p.m.)

BYLINE: Sun-News report

SECTION: SPORTS

LENGTH: 492 words


LAS CRUCES - The New Mexico State Aggie football team has reached an agreement
with Mike Dunbar to become the team's new offensive coordinator, head coach
DeWayne Walker announced on Wednesday evening.

Dunbar, who brings over 25 years of coaching experience to NMSU, last worked at
the University of Minnesota in the 2008 season.

"I'm excited for the opportunity to be the next offensive coordinator at New
Mexico State," Dunbar said. "I look forward to working with Coach Walker, the
staff and student-athletes to continue to build this football team into a
successful program."

Dunbar previously held the assistant head coach/offensive coordinator position
at Minnesota (2007-08). He has had previous stops at Central Washington
University (head coach, 1987-91), Toledo (offensive coordinator, 1992-96),
Northern Iowa (head coach, 1997-2000), Northwestern (tight ends, special teams,
2001; offensive coordinator, 2002-05) and California (offensive coordinator,
2006).

"I think Dunbar will bring some creativity to our offense," Walker said. "With
his experience, I feel confident that he will have seen almost everything
opposing defenses will throw at him and I think with his experience, he will be
able to adjust and put points on the board to help us be competitive in this
conference."

Dunbar was one of five candidates who interviewed for the NMSU offensive
coordinator position. The others were Feather River College head coach Steve
Mooshagian, Nebraska Kearney offensive coordinator Russ Martin, UNLV offensive
coordinator Rob Phenicie and Idaho quarterbacks coach Jonathan Smith.

NMSU and former offensive coordinator Timm Rosenbach parted ways following last
season, after the Aggie offense struggled to gain traction, finishing last in
the NCAA in scoring offense.

Dunbar, who runs his system out of a spread formation, has led some high-powered
offenses during his career.

In 2007, his Golden Gophers offense set a school record for pass completions in
a season (262) and had the second-most passing yards in school history (2,949).

While at Cal, Dunbar's Bears' offense ranked 12th in the nation in total offense
and were ranked in the top-35 in the country in passing offense (17th) and
rushing offense (33). The Bears averaged 32.8-points-per game in 2006.

Other highlights from Dunbar's career include tutoring Northwestern quarterback
Brett Basanez, as the Wildcats finished fourth in the nation in total offense in
2005, as well as guiding Toledo to 21 offensive records in 1995.

Brought to the University of Minnesota prior to the 2007 season with new head
coach Tim Brewster, Dunbar resigned following the 2008 campaign when the team
signaled a change of course in its offensive philosophy, moving from the spread
attack to a more power-running-based scheme. NMSU's agreement with Dunbar is
believed to be comparable to Rosenbach's $70,000 annual figure from a season
ago.

JOHN HANCOCK BOWL TO FOCUS ON OFFENSE

BYLINE: The Associated Press

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 3C

LENGTH: 352 words

DATELINE: EL PASO, TEXAS


One word sums up what the John Hancock Bowl is expected to be all about: Offense
.

Today's game between No. 19 Oklahoma and Texas Tech features Cale Gundy, the
Sooners' most prolific quarterback, and Red Raiders tailback Byron ``Bam''
Morris, the nation's leading college scorer.

``I think you have to favor somewhat of a high-scoring game,'' Oklahoma coach
Gary Gibbs said Thursday before leading his Sooners through a final walk-through
in the Sun Bowl stadium.

Oklahoma (8-3) averages 386.4 yards and 28.8 points a game with a balanced
offense led by Gundy, the top passer in Oklahoma history with 6,142 yards and 35
touchdowns.

``Offensively, they scare us to death,'' Tech coach Spike Dykes said.

Not that Texas Tech (6-5) hasn't been capable of frightening a few opponents
this year.

The Red Raiders, on a five-game winning streak, are averaging 475.2 yards and
37.2 points a game.

COLORADO, FRESNO ST. PREPARE FOR ALOHA: Elliot Uzelac tipped his hand as
Colorado began tapering off for its Christmas Day meeting with Fresno State in
the Aloha Bowl.

``We haven't added any new plays for this game,'' the Buffaloes' offensive
coordinator said.

With its basic offense, Uzelac said Colorado initially will try to soften Fresno
State's smaller but quick front line and then explore individual weaknesses.

On the Fresno State side, defensive coordinator Willy Robinson said his main
concern was stopping the run.

``We know they'll try to control the football in order to keep our offense off
the field because we have an explosive offense.''

NEW ORLEANS PREP QB STILL LOOKING: New Orleans prep football star Peyton Manning
says the possibility of a wide open passing attack at the University of
Mississippi is not going to be a big factor on whether he attends his father's
alma mater.

Manning, the son of Rebel legend Archie Manning, said he will visit Tennessee,
Florida State, Florida, Ole Miss and Texas.

CAL EXTENDS GILBERTSON'S CONTRACT: California coach Keith Gilbertson, whose team
pulled out of a midseason slide to earn a berth in the Alamo Bowl, was rewarded
with a two-year contract extension through the 1998 season.

Eagles' Kelly Shows the N.F.L. How to Run

BYLINE: By CHASE STUART

SECTION: Section B; Column 0; Sports Desk; ANALYSIS; Pg. 15

LENGTH: 900 words


The Philadelphia Eagles' heavily hyped offense did not disappoint in Chip
Kelly's N.F.L. coaching debut Monday night. The Eagles ran 30 plays in the first
quarter and 53 in the first half, operating at a dizzying pace against an
overmatched Washington Redskins defense in a 33-27 victory. The Eagles had 21
first downs in the first half, using an even faster tempo than the
lightning-quick, hurry-up offense the team showed in the preseason. Kelly took
his foot off the gas pedal in the second half, but he won over a lot of Eagles
fans, and skeptics, in just 30 minutes.

The Eagles shredded the Redskins on the ground, rushing 49 times for 263 yards.
In the 14 years under Andy Reid, the most carries Philadelphia had in a game was
46, in a Week 1 blowout against Dallas in 2000. On Monday, LeSean McCoy rushed
31 times for 184 yards and a touchdown, and looked every bit as good as those
numbers. But Philadelphia's success on the ground was particularly notable in
light of how the rest of the league fared in Week 1.

The passing game has dominated headlines for the past few years; teams have been
throwing more effectively and more frequently than ever. But there was an
underreported side story: in each of the last two seasons, the average N.F.L.
carry was for 4.3 yards, the only two times the league average had been so high.
So as passing records were being set each week, rushing efficiency was also
peaking.

But in Week 1, before Monday night, N.F.L. offenses were overmatched in the
running game. Miami, San Francisco and Seattle all won, but the Dolphins' Lamar
Miller rushed 10 times for 3 yards; the 49ers' Frank Gore had 21 carries for 44
yards; and the Seahawks' Marshawn Lynch gained just 43 yards on 17 rush
attempts. Perhaps it is not surprising that the plodding BenJarvus Green-Ellis
had 14 carries for 25 yards for the Cincinnati Bengals against the Chicago
Bears, but the explosive C. J. Spiller had just 41 yards on 17 carries for the
Buffalo Bills against the New England Patriots.

In Pittsburgh, neither the Steelers nor the Tennessee Titans could run the ball:
combined, their five running backs rushed for 137 yards on 51 carries, producing
an average gain of 2.7 yards. At MetLife Stadium, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' Doug
Martin and the Jets' Bilal Powell and Chris Ivory combined for 46 carries and
averaged 2.4 yards a carry.

On Sunday, only two players cracked the 100-yard mark: the second-string
Patriots running back Shane Vereen (101) and Oakland Raiders quarterback
Terrelle Pryor (112). This was the first time in 20 years that fewer than four
running backs cracked the century barrier in Week 1. More surprising, the league
average before Monday night was an abysmal 3.4 yards a carry. Apparently, the
N.F.L needed a college coach to put the running game in vogue again.

The Belichick Test

On Sunday, the Patriots defeated Buffalo and the rookie quarterback E J Manuel,
23-21. On Thursday night, the rookie Geno Smith and the Jets travel to New
England with the hope of pulling off an upset. Rookie quarterbacks are now 4-11
in games against Bill Belichick's Patriots, with one of those wins coming from
the last Jets rookie to start against New England: Mark Sanchez. The Jets are a
13-point underdog in Week 2. With the exception of a meaningless Week 17 New
England game against Vince Young and the Tennessee Titans in 2006, no team with
a rookie quarterback has been favored to beat Belichick's Patriots. At 13
points, the Jets are the largest underdog of any of the rookie-led teams.

For his career, Belichick is 18-9 as a coach or defensive coordinator against
rookie quarterbacks.

Boldin Connection

A decade ago, Anquan Boldin gained a stunning 200 receiving yards in his first
game with the Arizona Cardinals. On Sunday, Boldin topped that feat, with 208
yards, in his first game for the 49ers: he is now responsible for half of the
four 200-yard receiving games in Week 1 of an N.F.L. season since 1970. The
49ers traded a sixth-round pick to Baltimore to acquire Boldin in March, as the
Ravens were planning to cut him to clear $6 million in salary-cap space. It was
only one game, but Boldin was as valuable as any nonquarterback in the first
week of the season.

Boldin helped his new quarterback, Colin Kaepernick, have the first
400-passing-yard game of his young career in a 34-28 win over Green Bay.
Kaepernick did not hit the 300-yard mark until Super Bowl XLVII in February, but
he had his best passing game against a Packers secondary that was missing safety
Morgan Burnett and cornerback Casey Hayward. Kaepernick posted a 129.4 passer
rating on 39 passes, the highest rating on so many passes since Peyton Manning
-- three days earlier. From 2008 to 2012, only four quarterbacks hit those
thresholds in a game.

Predictive Power of Week 1

Everything is magnified in Week 1, including losses, especially in Tom
Coughlin's world. Since 1990, just 25 percent of all teams that lost in Week 1
made the playoffs. But that is a bit deceiving. Among all playoff teams since
1990, 68 percent of them won in the opener. That is the same winning percentage
those teams had in the rest of the regular season. In other words, good teams
lose games from time to time, but there is nothing special about losing in Week
1. For trivia buffs: the week that playoff teams are least likely to lose is
Week 3; playoff teams have had a 73.3 winning percentage in those weeks.

Princeton offense stands as Carril's legacy to sport;
COACH'S CONTRIBUTION TO GAME NETS AWARD

BYLINE: Jon Wilner, Mercury News

Pete Newell will present his annual Lifetime Achievement Award on Wednesday to a
coach who has never won an NCAA title, never made the Final Four, never reached
the Sweet 16 and might be best known for a game he lost.

But the award honors significant contributions to the game, and Pete Carril has
given basketball one of its greatest gifts: the Princeton offense.

If you haven't heard of it, you've probably seen it.

Designed by Carril decades ago to help his undersized Princeton Tigers compete
against bigger, stronger, faster, better athletes, the Princeton offense has
spread to all levels of the game in all corners of the country.

A 2003 Sports Illustrated survey discovered that more than 100 teams use some
form of Carril's offense -- from Meade High School in Spokane, Wash., to
Covenant College in Lookout Mountain, Ga.; from North Carolina State to the
Sacramento Kings.

It's easy to spot: Just look for something Jimmy Chitwood would appreciate.

``The reason it's popular is the desire to go back to the way the game was
played in the `Hoosiers' era,'' said John Moore, who uses Carril's system at
Westmont College in Santa Barbara. ``There's not a better way to play. People
always come up to us after games and say, `I love the way you play.' ''

In contrast to the modern NBA offense, where four players watch the fifth go
one-on-one, the Princeton offense is based on spacing, passing and moving
without the ball.

It clears out the basket area by positioning the center at the foul line and the
forwards on the wings.

If an offensive player is guarded closely, he cuts to the basket for a backdoor
layup. If given room, he shoots from the perimeter. It's as simple as that --
and also ridiculously complicated.

Most coaches use modified versions of Carril's system because the original is so
difficult to perfect -- there are numerous counters for every defensive
alignment -- and because it requires big men who are skilled shooters and
passers. But its principles of spacing and movement transcend time, space and
LeBron James.

``It comes from the old Boston Celtics and the old New York Knicks and some
things I picked up over the years,'' Carril said. ``You look at tapes of those
teams, and you'll see it.''

But the best place to look for the Princeton offense is the mind's eye, where
two Carril Classics are frozen forever: No. 16 seed Princeton's near-upset of
top-seeded, Alonzo Mourning-led Georgetown in the first round of the 1989 NCAA
tournament; and the Tigers' first-round knockout of defending champion UCLA in
1996, courtesy of -- what else? -- a backdoor layup with 3.8 seconds left.

During Carril's three decades at Princeton, the Tigers were always the team
nobody wanted to play and everybody wanted to watch.

``The players were always moving, and they'd come up with some of the easiest
shots I've seen in my life,'' said Newell, who will honor Carril at the ninth
annual Newell Challenge in Oakland, featuring a Stanford-Princeton and
Cal-DePaul doubleheader.

``I love the rhythm of that offense. They were a beautiful team to watch.''

The UCLA upset wasn't only Carril's best-known win; it was also the last of his
525. He retired after a second-round loss to Mississippi State. His separation
from basketball lasted all of three months. In June 1996, Carril joined the
Sacramento Kings as an assistant coach -- not because of any love for the city
but because Geoff Petrie, the Kings' president for basketball operations, played
for Carril at Princeton.

The Master eventually taught his offense to Vlade Divac and Chris Webber, big
men who could hit 15-footers and throw pinpoint bounce passes, and the Kings
became the most entertaining team in the NBA.

``If you're good at it,'' Petrie said, ``then one advantage is that you can
consistently get four or five baskets a game by just executing the offense and
not having someone go one-on-one.''

Carril is in his 10th season with the Kings. At 75, he shuffles from the locker
room to the bench alongside players who are 50 years younger and more than a
foot taller. (A short man to begin with, Carril hunches over when he walks.)

He has something of the crazed-professor look, with wide eyes and a tuft of
white hair. His wit is sharp, his voice steady and wise. He deflects
compliments, passes credit and says things like, ``No one can know beyond a
day.'' Some have compared him to Yoda, a brilliant mind atop a small, rounded
body.

In the coaching community, he's considered a guru.

On the East Coast, he's an icon.

In Springfield, Mass., he's a member of the Basketball Hall of Fame.

``Coach is a constant thinker,'' Petrie said. ``He's consumed with teaching,
with why things work, why they don't and all the elements involved.''

But for years, the blueprint to Princeton's offense was available only to
Carril's inner circle. He closed practices and, according to Sports Illustrated,
often refused to exchange game tapes with opponents.

The restrictions eased when Carril left Princeton and his former assistants
discussed the offense with colleagues. North Carolina State adopted it as a
means of competing with its more talented neighbors, Duke and North Carolina. It
became a hot topic at clinics and extremely popular with small-college coaches
who, like Carril back in the day, sent undersized big men to compete against
future lottery picks.

And in Sacramento, Carril taught the offense to fellow assistant Eddie Jordan,
who took it with him to New Jersey and then to Washington. The 24-second shot
clock precludes NBA teams from running the Princeton offense in its purest form,
but a handful of teams use versions of it.

``The fact that it's an old-time offense but is so alive today tells you all you
need to know,'' Newell said. ``It's a real contribution. . . . Pete has given
the game something it otherwise wouldn't have had.''

HOCKEY;
Muckler Preaches for More Offense, and the Rangers Make the Conversion

BYLINE: By JASON DIAMOS

SECTION: Section D; Page 7; Column 1; Sports Desk

LENGTH: 733 words


John Muckler sounded like Henry Armstrong yesterday afternoon after the Rangers'
6-3 dismantling of the expansion Atlanta Thrashers at Madison Square Garden.

Armstrong, the only boxer to simultaneously hold world titles in three weight
classes, coined the phrase, "The best defense is a good offense." Muckler, the
65-year-old coach of the Rangers, agrees.

"We want to use our offense as our defense," Muckler said after his team won for
the fourth time in five games to reach 42 points and pull into a tie with the
Carolina Hurricanes and the Boston Bruins for the eighth and final Eastern
Conference playoff spot. "A good offense is the best defense to have."

Muckler was referring to the Rangers' up-tempo, forechecking style, which is
designed to create neutral-zone turnovers and allow them to play a transition
game.

For much of this season, the Rangers had little offense, but recently that has
changed. In their last four victories, the retooled offense has scored 19 goals.
And now the Rangers (16-20-7-3) will play the Hurricanes in a home-and-home
series tomorrow and Thursday.

Yesterday, the Rangers received two goals from a revitalized John MacLean (one
short-handed, one on the power play) and goals from Jan Hlavac, Mike York, Adam
Graves and Valery Kamensky. The Thrashers' last two goals came after the Rangers
had taken a 6-1 lead.

"We're rolling over four lines, led by Petr Nedved's line, and it's made a world
of difference," Graves said.

Nedved's line set the tone for the second consecutive game. On Saturday, Nedved
set up Hlavac for two goals and scored another himself in a 5-2 victory over the
Islanders at Nassau Coliseum. The first of Hlavac's goals came 50 seconds into
the game. Yesterday, they combined to score nine seconds earlier.

Hlavac beat goalie Norm Maracle with a backhander 41 seconds into the game for
his seventh goal of the season. The goal was set up by Radek Dvorak and Nedved,
who shoveled a pass from the slot to Hlavac, who waited long enough to beat
Maracle from just off the right post, triggering a rout.

MacLean scored the first of his goals at 5 minutes 58 seconds of the first
period while the Rangers were short-handed. It was their second short-handed
goal in two days; they had gone 41 games without one.

Tim Taylor, who replays showed was offside, set up the short-handed goal.
Taylor's back pass from the blue line sent MacLean in on Maracle. MacLean's slap
shot from the slot slipped inside the left post for a 2-0 lead.

Forty-three seconds later, Graves forced a neutral-zone turnover, which enabled
York to score his 12th goal of the season and pull within a goal of the Devils'
Scott Gomez for the rookie scoring lead. The Rangers had a 3-0 lead on six
shots, and Maracle was pulled 6:41 into the game.

Dean Sylvester of Atlanta (11-28-4-3) cut the lead to 3-1 at 13:36, but then
Graves scored a power-play goal off a rebound at 18:06. The goal, his 15th of
the season, was Graves's 262nd as a Ranger, tying him with Vic Hadfield for
fourth on the team's career list.

After a scoreless second period, MacLean scored his ninth goal of the season and
second of the game on the power play at 7:12 of the third.

"I've been playing more," said MacLean, a 35-year-old right wing, when asked how
he had turned his season around. "And I'm getting some power-play time. That
always helps, too."

MacLean then helped set up Kamensky at 11:33 for the Rangers' final goal.
(Alexandre Daigle received the primary assist on the Rangers' final two goals.)
For Kamensky, it was his second goal in two days, after he had gone 15 games
without one.

"These were two teams we definitely have to beat to make the playoffs,"
defenseman Mathieu Schneider said of the Thrashers and the Islanders, the teams
with the two worst records in the National Hockey League. "Now, we have to carry
that over to our next couple of games."

SLAP SHOTS

ADAM GRAVES has played the past two games while his wife, VIOLET, is in the
hospital. On Friday night, she delivered twin boys two and a half months
prematurely. The boys, JAXON and LOGAN, are in incubators in intensive care.
"They're tough little guys like their mom," Graves said yesterday. "They're
going to keep battling."

KEVIN STEVENS was a healthy scratch for the second game in a row, and the
Rangers are trying to deal the 34-year-old forward, who is an alternate captain.

PRO FOOTBALL;
Giants May Have Edge, but Steelers Could Strike at a Moment's Notice

BYLINE: By FRANK LITSKY,  Special to The New York Times

SECTION: Section C; Page 5; Column 1; Sports Desk

LENGTH: 709 words

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH, Oct. 13


The Giants seem to have an edge on the Pittsburgh Steelers, but not that much.

The Steelers' offense is decent, the Giants' offense more dynamic. The Steelers'
defense is quick, active and struggling a bit, the Giants' defense bigger and
more efficient.

But when the Giants meet the Steelers on Monday night at Three Rivers Stadium,
they may find trouble.

The Steelers' offense can strike if Bubby Brister gets time to pass and if Eric
Green, the 285-yard tight end, gets free to catch passes. The defense and return
teams can make big plays because of Rod Woodson, perhaps the best cornerback in
the National Football League.

Up-and-Down Ways

Both teams have been inconsistent this season. The Super Bowl champion Giants
have a 3-3 record and the Steelers are 3-2. The Giants have not won on the road
and have not won twice in a row this season.

The 9 P.M. game will be carried in New York by Channel 7 and WNEW (AM 1130).

For a while last week, it seemed that Brister might miss the game because of a
torn knee ligament. But on Friday, he wore a custom-made knee brace in practice
and seemed mobile.

Although Brister is inconsistent, he plays with confidence. The Steelers try to
buy time for him with play action and rollouts. Like Jeff Hostetler of the
Giants, he will sometimes take off, although he lacks Hostetler's speed.

Joe Walton, Pittsburgh's offensive coordinator, uses the same grind-it-out
offense he used as head coach of the Jets. Last year, the Steelers' offense
rebelled at Walton's rigid scheme, and the offense was simplified.

No Restrictions

"This year," Brister said, "I'm not restricted at all by this offense. The
average yards per reception are more than we've ever had. We've had touchdown
passes of 20, 30 and 40 yards. We've had opportunities to go deep."

Those numbers aside, the Pittsburgh offense is conservative. It often uses two
tight ends, and that is more likely Monday because Louis Lipps, no longer a
dominant wide receiver, has a strained hamstring.

"Sure they're conservative," said Giants defensive end Leonard Marshall. "On
third down, they are throwing possession passes and haven't been looking for
long yardage."

The Steelers' running game is strong, especially on inside runs through holes
opened by trap blocks. Barry Foster is the tailback and Merril Hoge the
fullback. Hoge is really a tailback, and when the Steelers use a one-back
formation he is the back.

Green, with his size, can be a terror, and when Brister gets in trouble he looks
for him. Green is always on the field on offense, and on third down he lines up
with three wide receivers.

Playing Hide-and-Seek

"As big as Green is," said Al Groh, the Giants' defensive coordinator, "they
sometimes hide him. They move him all around. and you can lose him in play
action."

The offensive line is mobile and fairly solid. But it prefers finesse to muscle,
and it will probably not try to blow the Giants' front three off the line.

When the Giants have the ball, they will face a 3-4 defense much the same as the
one the Steelers used last year. It has speed, attacks quickly and gets to the
ball. It is smart.

It is also light up front, where the starting ends are Aaron Jones (257 pounds)
and Donald Evans (258). Its best players are Woodson at right cornerback and
David Little at inside linebacker.

"They don't do a lot of stunts," said Giants offensive tackle Jumbo Elliott.
"They just try to get you with quickness. The defensive backs support well."

The Giants seem likely to mix their offensive plays. With Rodney Hampton leading
the way, they ran effectively in last Sunday's 20-9 victory over the Phoenix
Cardinals. Hostetler's passing has been accurate the last two weeks.

Baker May Sit Out

That passing game will probably have to do without Stephen Baker, the starting
split end, who has a twisted back. But the Giants can find extra receivers in
Hampton out of the backfield or Dave Meggett out of the backfield or split out.

The Giants have a bye next weekend, then play their division leader, the
Washington Redskins, on a Sunday night. They started the weekend three games
behind the Redskins.

"That's why we have to beat the Steelers," said Coach Ray Handley of the Giants.

Man wanted by Hoke County Sheriff's Office for robbery, sex-related offenses
arrested in Florida

BYLINE: Nancy McCleary, The Fayetteville Observer, N.C.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 338 words


April 07--RAEFORD -- A man wanted by the Hoke County Sheriff's Office on robbery
and sex-related offenses was arrested Sunday in Florida, authorities said.

Hoke lawmen have been looking for Shomari Theodore Seaton, 25, since March when
they identified him as the suspect in a series of crimes near Moore County, a
Sheriff's Office release said.

An investigation began in December when lawmen began looking into reports of
armed robberies and sex offenses that were reported in the area of U.S. 15-501,
the release said.

The crimes continued through January and February as Hoke County investigators
attempted to identify the suspect, the release said.

On March 12, detectives learned Seaton's identity, but were unable to locate
him, the release said.

On Sunday, a deputy in Pinellas County, Florida, encountered Seaton, who is from
Yonkers, New York, while on patrol in Indian Rocks Beach.

Seaton had no identification and gave a fake name, according to release posted
on the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office website.

Deputies then used a mobile fingerprint reader and identified the man as Seaton,
the website release said.

Deputies discovered Seaton was wanted by the Hoke County Sheriff's Office and
the New York City Police Department, the release said.

Seaton is charged in Hoke County warrants with three counts of first-degree
kidnapping, two counts of attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon and one
count each of first-degree sexual offense, attempted first-degree sexual offense
, robbery with a dangerous weapon, crimes against nature, attempted crimes
against nature and sexual battery.

Seaton is wanted in New York on a robbery charge, the Pinellas County release
said.

He is being held in the Pinellas County Jail pending extradition to North
Carolina or New York.

Navy football assistant named head coach

BYLINE: staff and wire reports

LENGTH: 605 words


Navy promoted football assistant Ken Niumatalolo to the head coaching job
Saturday.

"After the Army-Navy game, I kind of tapped him on the shoulder and said, 'Hey
Kenny, if anything comes about I want to talk to you," athletic director Chet
Gladchuk said.

The decision was easy, given that Gladchuk wanted a coach who would continue
former coach Paul Johnson's potent triple-option offense.

"Fundamentally, at Navy it's going to be the triple option," Gladchuk said.
"It's an offense that has been really successful for us and given us that edge,
that dimension. If you look at who's out there that can run the triple option, I
consider Kenny one of the masters."

Niumatalolo said it didn't concern him that Johnson, who took a job at Georgia
Tech, might continue to get credit for the Midshipmen's vaunted rushing attack.

"I don't really care whose offense we call it. We're going to use it because it
works," he said. "I've been involved with this offense for 20 years. I've called
the plays for this offense before. I learned a lot from Paul about the various
wrinkles and how to make adjustments."

The 42-year-old Niumatalolo, who's of Samoan descent but was born and raised in
Hawaii, is believed to be the first Polynesian head coach in NCAA history.

"Hopefully, if I do well it will open doors for some other guys," he said.

Oilers excited about Rhome's new offense // Versatile scheme puts pressure on
defense

BYLINE: Jarrett Bell

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 9C

LENGTH: 470 words

DATELINE: SAN ANTONIO


One problem with the scheme that new offensive coordinator Jerry Rhome is
installing for the Houston Oilers: It doesn't have a name.

At least the run-and-shoot offense sounded cool, until Buddy Ryan called it the
chuck-and-duck.

But like the unit it beholds, Rhome's offense hopes to gain an identity with
results. Without quarterback Warren Moon last year, the Oilers' once-potent
offense plummeted to 26th in the NFL.

Says quarterback Chris Chandler, reunited with Rhome after a free-agent move
from the Rams: "It's 'Rock's Offense.' Jerry's nickname is Rock."

Semantics aside, Rhome, 52, has generated enthusiasm with players learning a new
language and new tricks.

"When the defensive backs around the league see me blocking, they are going to
be surprised," says Haywood Jeffires, who got into a practice scuffle last week
after throwing a block. "In the run-and-shoot, we shadow-blocked. Now, we want
contact."

Rhome's offense is keyed by power running. But it's versatile, with
four-receiver sets and two-tight end formations. It's also heavy on shifting.

Call it a melting pot of systems he's worked in - including Don Coryell's old
San Diego scheme, Joe Gibbs' ex-Washington offense and Ernie Zampese's current
Dallas style.

"The system's been around, and everybody's put their stamp on it," says Rhome,
Minnesota's receivers coach last year and, before that, the Cardinals' offensive
coordinator. "I've tried to take the best and build an offense. The key is that
we always want to be a step ahead of the defense. We're never going to line up
and just stay the same."

Players have scrambled to adjust, many de-programming from ex-coach Jack
Pardee's run-and-shoot.

"There's a lot of teaching going on right now," receiver Gary Wellman says.
"Running routes, there's not as much freedom as in the run-and-shoot to find an
opening. This offense is much more precise."

The offense's success starts with linemen no longer left with one-on-one
assignments on every down.

"In the run-and-shoot, if one man got beat, it caused a lot of pressure," guard
Kevin Donnalley says. "Now, we're sliding and can reconfigure the schemes each
week. So if there's a Bruce Smith out there, we can use two men to block him."

Also, head coach Jeff Fisher is encouraged that running back Gary Brown,
hampered by a foot injury last year, is in superb condition. Brown likes the
extra blockers and a deeper set-up. The run-and-shoot used four receivers and no
tight end or fullbacks.

"As a runner, you have more time to read things in this system," says Brown, a
1,000-yard runner in 1993. "I'm looking forward to a big year."

Adds Donnalley: "It's not only running. It's defenses thinking you'll run. There
were defensive linemen licking their chops with the run-and-shoot, wanting to
bolster their sack stats."

Cranking up offense is a priority

HIGHLIGHT: Quinn hopes to get team operating at early-season level.


FLOWERY BRANCH ? When first-year Falcons coach Dan Quinn reconvenes the team
Monday morning, he'll present them with his plan for the rest of the season.

The Falcons limped into the bye week after back-to-back upsets at the hands of
Tampa Bay and San Francisco. Despite the apparent need to fine-tune some things,
they were given the week off.

Quinn's challenge is to get the Falcons playing as they did when they opened the
season with five consecutive wins. Since losing 31-21 in New Orleans on Oct. 15,
the offense has been in disarray and there was a rash of penalties and
turnovers. The highlight of the past four games was a 10-7 win Oct. 25 over
Tennessee and backup quarterback Zach Mettenberger.

Quinn believes that the Falcons can recapture their early play that enabled them
to open the season with thrilling victories over Philadelphia, the New York
Giants, Dallas and Washington. They also routed the Houston Texans.

During the backslide, several issues surfaced for the Falcons. Some of them may
be manageable for Quinn and his staff. Others may just be the stark cold
reality.

The Falcons may be able to fix their issues on offense, but the lack of a pass
rush, despite the team spending massive resources in the area, may be harder to
solve. They have 10 sacks, which ranks 31st in the NFL.

So, the winning formula ? with the Falcons three games behind Carolina in the
NFC South with seven games to play if the Panthers beat Tennessee on Sunday ?
may be to crank the offense back to when it averaged 33.5 points over the first
five games. The offense has averaged only 16.7 points over the past four games.

Quarterback Matt Ryan and wide receivers Roddy White and Julio Jones met after
the San Francisco game and shared ideas on how to get the offense rolling. Ryan
stayed back while others went on bye-week vacations.

Ryan analyzed every pass play from this season. He'll share his report with
offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan.

In addition to playing faster, running more no-huddle and getting White more
involved, Ryan believes the players must elevate their play and execute
Shanahan's game plan. He believes the offense can get back on track.

"We feel like we can be a very good offense," Ryan said on his weekly appearance
on 680 The Fan. "We haven't been that (over) the last couple of weeks. There are
a number of different reasons for it. But I feel like the talent is there. Our
production can be there if we play better than we have. But we're certainly
capable of doing it because we have done it earlier this year."

One theory is that when teams saw the Falcons on tape, they solved the team's
new scheme. There's some merit in that because the open receivers we saw in the
first five games are now blanketed. The 49ers knew how to attack the outside
zone scheme and held running back Devonta Freeman to 12 yards on 12 carries.

Several players floated the notion that teams have figured out the offense and
there must be some counter-moves.

"I think that comes from guys just being frustrated with not getting the job
done," Ryan said. "We've got a lot of competitive guys in our locker room. From
them figuring us out, sometimes you have to tip your hat to the defense that you
go against. (San Francisco) outplayed us. They played better than we did. That's
what it comes down to."

Despite the challenges, Ryan is upbeat. "You have to be positive," he said.
"We're nine games into it. We're right in the mix. We are right where we want to
be. You'd love to have a couple more wins under your belt, but we didn't get
that done."

One of the perplexing parts of the offense over the first nine games has been
the underutilization of White, who's averaged 78.3 catches over the past three
seasons since Jones has taken over as the top receiver. White, a three-time Pro
Bowl player who turned 34 this month, has 17 catches on 30 targets. He has
essentially been the fourth option.

Ryan said the team has preferred some of the other matchups and has featured
those whether it was wide receiver Leonard Hankerson early or tight end Jacob
Tamme of late.

"Certainly, we'd love to have Roddy more involved," Ryan said. "I really think
he's going to be productive for us the rest of the season."

The Falcons must be careful about trying to play faster. They could pick up the
tempo, get stuffed and leave the defense out on the field too often.

"I'd like to see us play better," Ryan said. "Whether that's faster or what, we
have to adjust. Everybody is willing to do that. We just need to play better
than we have."

Quinn is open to using more of the Falcons' no-huddle attack. Ryan has operated
the no-huddle since his rookie season.

"We'll definitely look into that," Quinn said. "We've got a big play-book. We
have a lot of volume and our no-huddle package is certainly something that, when
it's the right time to feature it, we certainly will."

BRIEF: Lee County Detention Center employee accused of committing sex offenses
with a female inmate

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 133 words


Sept. 21--SANFORD -- A Lee County Detention Center employee is accused of
committing sex offenses with a female inmate he was taking to Raleigh.

David Adams Jr., 55, of the 1000 block of Windrace Trail in Sanford, was charged
Saturday with second-degree sex offense and sex offense by a person having
custody of a victim, a Raleigh Police Department release said.

Adams was transporting the woman, who is an adult, to Raleigh on Sept. 15 when
the alleged incident happened, the release said.

Investigators determined the incident happened in the Raleigh city limits, the
release said.

Bail was set at $500,000.

Whiten says sex was consensual

BYLINE: FROM NEWS SERVICES

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 04C

LENGTH: 294 words


New York Yankees outfielder Mark Whiten denied raping a woman at the team's
hotel and contended the sex was consensual, Milwaukee police said. The
Associated Press reported erroneously Monday that Whiten was arrested on a
charge of second-degree sexual assault.

However, police have recommended a charge of second-degree sexual assault, which
carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. The district attorney's office
said it may decide later this week on whether to charge the 30-year-old
ballplayer.

Whiten initially told investigators he didn't have sex with the 31-year-old
woman, then acknowledged he did, according to a police arrest report.

Last week, the outfielder missed two games to go to Clearwater, Fla., to join
his wife Sheri when she delivered the couple's second child, a boy.

More trouble for Cordero

Red Sox left fielder Wilfredo Cordero is scheduled to face a new charge of
violating a restraining order when he appears in Cambridge District Court
Thursday for a pretrial conference. Cordero, 25, was arrested June 11 on charges
of assault and battery on his wife.

The charge was filed several weeks after the 25-year-old Cordero pleaded
innocent to making threats and attacking his wife with a dangerous weapon, a
phone, Heffron said.

Briefly . . .

Robin Ventura, sidelined since March 21 with a fractured ankle, returns from his
minor league rehabilitation assignments on Thursday. . . . Minnesota placed
pitcher Bob Tewksbury on the 15-day DL with a sore right shoulder. . . .
Milwaukee pitcher Ben McDonald will have surgery on his right shoulder and could
be out for the year. . . . Oft-injured Boston third baseman Tim Naehring will
have surgery on his right elbow and will miss the rest of the season.

Take advantage of games vs. Cowboys

BYLINE: Matt Pitzer

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 3C

LENGTH: 325 words


The Jacksonville Jaguars' takedown of the Dallas Cowboys says less about
Jacksonville than it does about Dallas.

When the inconsistent Jaguars can waltz in and quarterback David Garrard and
wide receiver Mike Sims-Walker post career-best numbers -- a week after the New
York Giants dropped 41 points on the Cowboys -- you can lose any trepidation
about starting anybody against Dallas.

Expect the Green Bay Packers offense to crank up again next week. Dallas'
remaining schedule includes plenty of powerful offenses, including a Week 10
rematch vs. the Giants, two games against the Philadelphia Eagles and matchups
against the Indianapolis Colts and New Orleans Saints.

Opposing offenses have an advantage when the Cowboys cannot hold on to the ball
or sustain drives. While QB Jon Kitna's four interceptions might not all have
been his fault, they stifled Dallas' offense nonetheless.

Kitna's favorite targets Sunday were Miles Austin and Dez Bryant.  Continue
considering them in favorable matchups, but this combination breeds uncertainty:
a backup quarterback, a team performing far below expectations and a wide range
of potential stars who can excel any week.

*Owners who  held on to Carolina Panthers running back Jonathan Stewart should
have been happy when he started in place of DeAngelo Williams (foot) on Sunday
against the St. Louis Rams. But they were not happy with his  30 yards on 14
carries. Give him a shot next week against New Orleans but with lowered
expectations.

*After the New York Jets were shut out against the Packers,  dial back
expectations  going into road games against the rejuvenated Detroit Lions and
the Cleveland Browns. Now isn't the time to panic on LaDainian Tomlinson, but it
does show the risk of depending on players such as Braylon Edwards or tight end
Dustin Keller. QB Mark Sanchez should have better games ahead, but  he is a
risky start. -- Matt Pitzer

Once a rebel but now a ...;
REVOLUTIONARY;
Texas Tech coach Mike Leach's offense with the emphasis on the quarterback is
now the norm

BYLINE: John Helsley

SECTION: SPORTS; COLLEGE FOOTBALL INSIDER; Pg. 14C

LENGTH: 1122 words


Mike Leach used to come off as a rebel.

He showed up in West Texas with a gunslinger's mentality, molding quarterbacks
to fire footballs at a ridiculous rate, bucking forever beliefs that three
things can happen when you pass, two of them bad.

Turns out, Leach was more revolutionary than rebel.

Look around, teams coast-to-coast are flinging footballs, most operating some
form of the spread offense formally employed only by rebels like Leach.

And the shift in philosophy has shifted focus.

Quarterbacks rule!

Sure, strong quarterback play has always been vital. Now it's mandatory.

Not so long ago, a strong running game was a requirement to success. Today?
Almost every team in the top 10 is identified by its QB.

Ohio State: Todd Boeckman; can you name anyone else on the OSU offense?

Boston College: Matt Ryan; Heisman frontrunner.

LSU: Matt Flynn; not as dynamic as some, yet still the face of the Tigers'
offense.

Arizona State: Rudy Carpenter; sent Sam Keller packing.

Oregon: Dennis Dixon; running back Jonathan Stewart is a stud, but it's Dixon
who's climbing the Heisman charts.

Oklahoma: Sam Bradford; answered all the questions and more.

West Virginia: Pat White; shares the spotlight with running back Steve Slaton,
yet does more.

Kansas: Todd Reesing; the face and the guts of the Jayhawks.

Missouri: Chase Daniel; the best of a very good Big 12 bunch.

Georgia: Matthew Stafford; Dawg-gone good.

Beyond the top 10, there's more of the same. Colt Brennan's record-setting right
arm has Hawaii unbeaten and on the map, bidding to crash the BCS bash. The
Warriors average 459.5 yards a game, outdone only by Texas Tech.

Which brings us back to Leach, whose madcap attack armed by Graham Harrell
averages 481.2 yards through the air in Tech's latest assault on the NCAA
records book.

While Leach still has no true peer, he's gaining followers in the aerial
revolution.

"Now everybody is throwing it, or quite a few," Leach said. "It seems to me that
the Big 12 is kind of the Pac-10."

Meanwhile, good running backs can't hardly get noticed.

In the latest ESPN Heisman Watch, no running back received as much as a single
first place vote. Ditto for wide receivers.

Remember Darren McFadden, the preseason fave? He and his Arkansas team have
taken a tumble, as have run-first offenses.

The names to know are Ryan and Dixon and White and Florida's Tim Tebow.

Quarterbacks rule.

Invaluable arms  More and more, running offenses are running on empty.
Quarterbacks have been entrusted with dictating play through the air and the
method has taken hold.

These winning quarterbacks are responsible for a major portion of their team's
offense. Here's a look at just how responsible they are:

Graham Harrell, Texas Tech: 79.3 percent of team's offense

Colt Brennan, Hawaii: 78.1 percent

Tim Tebow, Florida: 72.4 percent

Matt Ryan, Boston College: 69.9 percent

Brian Brohm, Louisville: 69.5 percent

Paul Smith, Tulsa: 68.9 percent

Chase Daniel, Missouri: 68.7 percent

Dennis Dixon, Oregon: 56.7 percent

Sam Bradford, Oklahoma: 51.7 percent

Pat White, West Virginia: 45.8 percent

Who's hot and who's not: The Saban Bowl and a new coach for SMU Who's hot

Backyard ball: We've all drawn up plays in the dirt. But even in those
skirmishes against the kids from the other block, none ever went down so
marvelously magical as the "lateralpalooza" in Division III Trinity's 28-24 win
over Millsaps. Seven players. Fifteen laterals. Consuming a minute and two
seconds. If you still haven't seen it, race to YouTube - now!

The Saban Bowl: LSU fans are warming to Les Miles - for now - but they're still
fired up about their ex-coach, too. And it is an "ex" relationship with Nick
Saban. With the Tigers headed for Alabama and a meeting with Saban, LSU fans
requested 30,000 tickets, a school record for a road game. Geaux get him!

Who's not  Phil Bennett, unemployed: Fired from SMU this week after yet another
loss, this one to Tulsa, Bennett admitted he realized the challenge of leading
such a downtrodden program when he took the job. Some challenges aren't worth
tackling. Note to all assistant coaches (ahem, Brent Venables, Larry Fedora):
Patience, patience.

Trojan horses: Remember when Southern Cal was the near-unanimous No. 1?
Supposedly stacked with tailbacks and tantalizing talent at every position, all
just stopping in on the way to NFL stardom, the Trojans stood as the one team to
count on this season. Now they've been counted out.

Scouting the Big 12  What's happening in the conference beyond the focus of OU
and OSU:

Nebraska at No. 8 Kansas, 11:30 a.m., FSN: Another series rout - in reverse.

Kansas State at Iowa State, 11:30 a.m., Versus: 'Cats cling to faint North title
hopes.

Texas Tech at Baylor, 2 p.m.: Looong day into night - 100-plus passes likely.

No. 9 Missouri at Colorado, 5:30 p.m., FSN: Buffs stunted Tech's spread attack.

Helsley's Top 10  1. Boston College: Showed a lot of guts at V-Tech.

2. Ohio State: Is it time to start believing?

3. LSU: Les Miles meets his maker, so to speak.

4. Oregon: QB Dennis Dixon deserves some Heisman love.

5. Oklahoma: Still looking for BCS help; winning not enough.

6. Arizona State: Can the Sun Devils keep proving us wrong?

7. West Virginia: Won't lose again.

8. Kansas: Hey, Bill Self would take an 8-0 - soon to be 9-0 - start.

9. Missouri: Can't get ahead of themselves on path to KU showdown.

10. Michigan: You laugh? Watch the Wolverines reach the Rose Bowl.

Reasons to believe Texas didn't miss out on Ryan Perrilloux...

Once committed to the Longhorns, the nation's No. 1 quarterback recruit stung
Texas by switching to LSU. A sophomore, Perrilloux hasn't become the force
expected for the Tigers, backing up starter Matt Flynn. Now he's been suspended
for the second time this season. Meanwhile, UT quarterback Colt McCoy is an
ideal face for his program.

Navy ships will cheer...  When Navy takes on Notre Dame today, the Midshipmen
will be looking to end more than four decades of futility against the Fighting
Irish. Notre Dame has won 43 straight in the series and is favored again,
despite its 1-7 record. Still, Navy, 4-4, can score (35.8 ppg), while first
downs remain a challenge for the Irish. Wouldn't Roger Staubach, the quarterback
the last time Navy beat the Irish, be proud?

UConn football is here to stay  It only took a century-plus, but Huskies
football is on the map. UConn has been playing football since 1896, yet prior
success isn't easily identifiable, not even when the team was I-AA. Now, UConn,
7-1 overall, leads the Big East with a 3-0 record that features back-to-back
wins over Louisville and South Florida. Coach Randy Edsall seems to know what
he's doing, and recruiting is picking up.

first place vote. Ditto for wide receivers.

Remember Darren McFadden, the preseason fave? He and his Arkansas team have
taken a tumble, as have run-first offenses.

The names to know are Ryan and Dixon and White and Florida's Tim Tebow.

Quarterbacks rule.

Invaluable arms  More and more, running offenses are running on empty.
Quarterbacks have been entrusted with dictating play through the air and the
method has taken hold.

These winning quarterbacks are responsible for a major portion of their team's
offense. Here's a look at just how responsible they are:

Graham Harrell, Texas Tech: 79.3 percent of team's offense

Colt Brennan, Hawaii: 78.1 percent

Tim Tebow, Florida: 72.4 percent

Matt Ryan, Boston College: 69.9 percent

Brian Brohm, Louisville: 69.5 percent

Paul Smith, Tulsa: 68.9 percent

Chase Daniel, Missouri: 68.7 percent

Dennis Dixon, Oregon: 56.7 percent

Sam Bradford, Oklahoma: 51.7 percent

Pat White, West Virginia: 45.8 percent

Who's hot and who's not: The Saban Bowl and a new coach for SMU Who's hot

Backyard ball: We've all drawn up plays in the dirt. But even in those
skirmishes against the kids from the other block, none ever went down so
marvelously magical as the "lateralpalooza" in Division III Trinity's 28-24 win
over Millsaps. Seven players. Fifteen laterals. Consuming a minute and two
seconds. If you still haven't seen it, race to YouTube - now!

The Saban Bowl: LSU fans are warming to Les Miles - for now - but they're still
fired up about their ex-coach, too. And it is an "ex" relationship with Nick
Saban. With the Tigers headed for Alabama and a meeting with Saban, LSU fans
requested 30,000 tickets, a school record for a road game. Geaux get him!

Who's not  Phil Bennett, unemployed: Fired from SMU this week after yet another
loss, this one to Tulsa, Bennett admitted he realized the challenge of leading
such a downtrodden program when he took the job. Some challenges aren't worth
tackling. Note to all assistant coaches (ahem, Brent Venables, Larry Fedora):
Patience, patience.

Trojan horses: Remember when Southern Cal was the near-unanimous No. 1?
Supposedly stacked with tailbacks and tantalizing talent at every position, all
just stopping in on the way to NFL stardom, the Trojans stood as the one team to
count on this season. Now they've been counted out.

Scouting the Big 12  What's happening in the conference beyond the focus of OU
and OSU:

Nebraska at No. 8 Kansas, 11:30 a.m., FSN: Another series rout - in reverse.

Kansas State at Iowa State, 11:30 a.m., Versus: 'Cats cling to faint North title
hopes.

Texas Tech at Baylor, 2 p.m.: Looong day into night - 100-plus passes likely.

No. 9 Missouri at Colorado, 5:30 p.m., FSN: Buffs stunted Tech's spread attack.

Helsley's Top 10  1. Boston College: Showed a lot of guts at V-Tech.

2. Ohio State: Is it time to start believing?

3. LSU: Les Miles meets his maker, so to speak.

4. Oregon: QB Dennis Dixon deserves some Heisman love.

5. Oklahoma: Still looking for BCS help; winning not enough.

6. Arizona State: Can the Sun Devils keep proving us wrong?

7. West Virginia: Won't lose again.

8. Kansas: Hey, Bill Self would take an 8-0 - soon to be 9-0 - start.

9. Missouri: Can't get ahead of themselves on path to KU showdown.

10. Michigan: You laugh? Watch the Wolverines reach the Rose Bowl.

Note: See Nos. 11-25 on Helsley's blog on The Pass

Reasons to believe Texas didn't miss out on Ryan Perrilloux...

Once committed to the Longhorns, the nation's No. 1 quarterback recruit stung
Texas by switching to LSU. A sophomore, Perrilloux hasn't become the force
expected for the Tigers, backing up starter Matt Flynn. Now he's been suspended
for the second time this season. Meanwhile, UT quarterback Colt McCoy is an
ideal face for his program.

Navy ships will cheer...  When Navy takes on Notre Dame today, the Midshipmen
will be looking to end more than four decades of futility against the Fighting
Irish. Notre Dame has won 43 straight in the series and is favored again,
despite its 1-7 record. Still, Navy, 4-4, can score (35.8 ppg), while first
downs remain a challenge for the Irish. Wouldn't Roger Staubach, the quarterback
the last time Navy beat the Irish, be proud?

UConn football is here to stay  It only took a century-plus, but Huskies
football is on the map. UConn has been playing football since 1896, yet prior
success isn't easily identifiable, not even when the team was I-AA. Now, UConn,
7-1 overall, leads the Big East with a 3-0 record that features back-to-back
wins over Louisville and South Florida. Coach Randy Edsall seems to know what
he's doing, and recruiting is picking up.

BRIEF: McDowell's Spearman selected to all-star football game

BYLINE: Erie Times-News, Pa.

SECTION: SPORTS

LENGTH: 204 words


Dec. 18--McDowell senior Tyree Spearman has been selected to play in the Offense
-Defense Showcase Bowl in early January at the Citrus Bowl Stadium in Orlando,
Fla.

The Showcase Bowl is part of the Offense-Defense Bowl Week, which features a
variety of all-star games and festivities from the youth level through high
school.

The highlight of the week is the Offense-Defense All-American Bowl, which
features 80 of the top seniors throughout the United States. That game is
scheduled for Jan. 3 at the Citrus Bowl. Cam Newton and Dez Bryant are among the
alumni of the Offense-Defense All-American Bowl.

The Showcase Bowl portion of the event includes a series of all-star games on
Jan. 3-4.

Offense-Defense Sports in Myrtle Beach, S.C., conducts the bowls.

Spearman is a 5-foot 10-inch, 170-pound senior who played defensive back and
running back for the Trojans. He was a District 10 All-Star selection and an
all-Region 6 pick as a junior. He also was honored as a third-team all-state
defensive back by Pennsylvania Football News in 2012. (All-star teams have not
been released for 2013.)

Reliance on the pass not just a trend in NFL

BYLINE: Scott Brown

LENGTH: 817 words


The four teams that received first-round byes in the NFL playoffs have a
combined record of 52-12. To say they ran over the competition en route to the
postseason would not be entirely accurate.

All of those teams have won big by using the pass as their primary mode of
moving the ball. Their success may initiate what could be considered a seismic
shift in strategy -- if it hasn't already happened.

The Indianapolis Colts are challenging the long-standing football tenet that
victory is directly proportional to a team's ability to run the ball.
Indianapolis finished the regular season with a 14-2 record despite ranking 31st
out of 32 teams in rushing offense.

The Peyton Manning-led Colts were No. 2 in passing offense, and of the eight
division winners, only the Cincinnati Bengals did not rank in the top 10 in that
category.

The Bengals are ranked last among the 12 playoff teams by Las Vegas oddsmakers,
according to gaming expert R.J. Bell of pregame.com.

"I've said a thousand times, the league evolves offensively and defensively,"
said Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, who threw for a franchise-record
4,328 yards this season. "And you have to keep up with Indianapolis, the (New
Orleans) Saints, teams like that. Because if you don't, you are going to be left
behind."

The passing sensibility that has gripped the NFL is evident even with a team
such as the 12-4 Minnesota Vikings.

While Adrian Peterson rushed for almost 1,400 yards this season, quarterback
Brett Favre became the centerpiece of the Vikings' offense. Minnesota ranked
eighth in the NFL in passing offense.

"I think what people are starting to see is that 'three or four yards and a
cloud of dust' is not good enough anymore, and that we need chunk plays," said
Miami Dolphins coach Tony Sparano, whose team finished 7-9 despite ranking
fourth in rushing offense.

The Steelers, who have long been associated with a smash-mouth ethos, appeared
to embrace that concept this season as they finished seventh in passing offense.

More and more, defenses are daring teams to throw, which often results in bigger
passing numbers.

"If you get eight in the box, that means there's three covering, and you have
three receivers," Philadelphia Eagles fullback Leonard Weaver said. "So if you
have those odds, that's exactly what you'll take."

The odds are further stacked against defensive backs because of rules that are
geared toward more scoring and higher TV ratings.

Defensive players are not allowed to initiate contact with a receiver beyond 5
yards of the line of scrimmage. A pass interference penalty, meanwhile, is a
spot foul; in college it is a 15-yard infraction.

"If you're smart, you've got to take advantage of that," Eagles linebacker
Jeremiah Trotter said of the rules that help passing offenses. "You can't really
touch the receiver after five yards, and if you breathe on them, you get a flag.
You'd be crazy not to take advantage of that."

More and more teams are doing just that, said Steelers inside linebacker James
Farrior, a 13-year veteran.

"When I first came into the league, there was a lot more running involved," he
said. "I think with the type of athletes we have on offense, you're more apt to
go to for big plays. The main guy on the field is the quarterback, and they want
to throw the ball 100,000 times a game."

San Diego quarterback Philip Rivers set career highs this season in passing
attempts (486) and yards (4,254), and he is a major reason why the Chargers take
an 11-game winning streak into the postseason.

Rivers has taken over an offense that not too long ago ran through running back
LaDainian Tomlinson, the league's MVP in 2006.

But Rivers said the running game is still vital to the Chargers' offense, which
works best off play-action passes.

That teams are not about to abandon the run can be seen in what happened with
the Steelers last week. Coach Mike Tomlin considered going in another direction
with the offense even though the Steelers had their first 4,000-yard passer, two
1,000-yard receivers and 1,000-yard rusher in franchise history.

Offensive coordinator Bruce Arians is returning for at least one more season,
but the Steelers could put more of an emphasis on running the ball in 2010.

"Teams still run the ball," Trotter said. "They have to establish the run. But a
lot of times you see teams in passing sets and run the ball that way. It's the
nature of the beast."

Passing interest

Top passing teams are also among the best teams in the NFL this season. Here is
a look at such teams compared with teams that were the most successful running
the ball:

Combined record of top 10 passing teams: 113-47

Combined record of top 10 running teams: 87-73

Playoff teams among top 10 passing teams: 8

Playoff teams among the top 10 running teams: 5

Teams with a winning record among top 10 passing teams: 10

Teams with a winning record among top 10 running teams: 5

Eagles offense will keep NFL Network's Mike Mayock on his toes

BYLINE: By Marc Narducci; Inquirer Staff Writer

SECTION: SPORTS; P-com Spt. Eagles; Pg. D07

LENGTH: 423 words


KANSAS CITY, Mo. - The fast-paced Eagles offense has a major effect not only on
opposing defenses, but also on the announcers' booth.

When play-by-play man Brad Nessler and analyst Mike Mayock call Thursday night's
game between the Eagles and visiting Kansas City Chiefs for the NFL Network, the
announcers, like Eagles quarterback Michael Vick and the rest of the offense,
will be in hurry-up mode.

"The pace of the offense dictates the pace of a broadcast," Mayock said in a
phone interview. "From an analyst perception, it means probably a lot less
replays than we normally get in, and that is fine."

Analysts make their reputation by dissecting replays, but Mayock said nobody
will care what is said if it is at the expense of the live action.

"The No. 1 cardinal sin in TV is don't miss a live snap, and there is nothing
worse than being in the middle of a replay and cutting back, where the person at
home misses half the play," he said. "You can't miss any live action, and it
will be a different game plan for us, which is to be careful when we insert
replays."

Mayock said the obvious story line centers on Andy Reid's return to Philadelphia
with the 2-0 Chiefs. Yet Mayock, like so many others, is also intrigued by
Kelly's offense

"It is a breath of fresh air in the NFL, and it's kind of interesting that this
offense has taken on such a dimension nationally," he said. "I was at 10 to 12
training camps this preseason, and all people wanted to talk about was what Chip
Kelly's offense was like and how it would work."

On a personal level, the 55-year-old Mayock said it is extra special for him to
be analyzing an Eagles game at Lincoln Financial Field. A graduate of Haverford
School, he's been following the Eagles for decades.

"The first home game in the regular season I did [involving the Eagles] was last
year against Cincinnati on a Thursday night, and before we started I was
standing in the broadcast booth looking and saying, 'This is pretty cool,' "
Mayock said, referring to a game Dec. 13 that the Bengals won, 34-13.

Now he will return to Lincoln Financial Field, and so will the memories.

"I remember being 10, and my dad was an offensive-line coach at Penn, and I
would go with him to his office on Sunday when the Eagles were playing at
Franklin Field," Mayock said. "I could see the Eagles when I was 10, and here I
was last year on the 50 [yard line] getting to call a game, and I got extra
butterflies and a kick out of the fact."

Oct. 28--SANTA CLARA

On Thursday, reporters were treated to a history lesson and a football lesson
all in one, and it happened by surprise.

In a group interview, Michael Erler from CBSSports.com asked 49ers defensive
coordinator Vic Fangio if the Browns, the 49ers' next opponent, are "a mirror
image" of the Niners offensively. Erler was referring to the West Coast Offense
both teams run.

Fangio took a moment to think, then launched into an answer, which takes a major
left turn in the third sentence:

"In some ways," he said. "They run some of the same routes. The West Coast
Offense that everyone claims they run, nobody really runs the West Coast Offense
that Bill Walsh used to run. All these self-proclaimed West Coast Offenses
really are not running Bill Walsh's offense. They use his nomenclature in
defining and naming formations, but they're really not running the offense that
he used to run. Everybody's taken their own version of it and put their own
little mark on it, but to me, I don't see anybody running the West Coast Offense
."

Fangio had taken a good question and gave a great answer, put Walsh into
historical perspective. Remember, he also said the "self-proclaimed West Coast
Offenses don't run the West Coast Offense." The Niners are a self-proclaimed
West Coast Offense. What does that tell you?

Which team is closest to what Bill Walsh ran?

"I don't know," Fangio said. "It started changing way back when Mike Holmgren
took over as the offensive coordinator here. He put his little twists on it. It
was still very similar to Bill Walsh's offense. When he went to Green Bay, it
changed a whole lot more. And then all those guys that have come from Holmgren
and have become head coaches and moved on to other teams, they changed it even
more. It's really morphed into everybody's own offense with the roots how they
call formations being the same, but I really don't see teams running an offense
real similar to what Bill Walsh did."

Fangio was making radical statements. To most people reading this article, Walsh
still defines West Coast Offense. Not so, Fangio was saying.

How have the Browns diverged from Walsh's West Coast Offense?

"You can see the influence there," Fangio said. "The head coach (Pat Shurmur)
was at Philadelphia with Andy Reid, who came through Mike Holmgren. Mike
Holmgren is the general manager there (in Cleveland) now. So you see some
similarities between all that stuff, certain plays are still the same. You don't
see the commitment to the whole offense the way Bill Walsh was committed to it."

"Would a pure Bill Walsh West Coast Offense still work today?

"Yes, it could. The running game has changed. That's where it all started to
change. Holmgren ran a good bit of his offense out of I-backs where Bill hardly
ever did that. It just kind of morphed from there and it was an evolution they
were forced to do based upon the defenses."

I want you to understand that last point because offensive coordinator Greg
Roman enters in a moment and you need to be prepared for him. The stress on an
I-back formation -- running back behind fullback behind quarterback -- changed
the pure West Coast Offense from the Walsh version. Remember that.

Roman entered the media tent.

Does he consider what he runs a West Coast Offense?

"No question, the principles are the same," Roman said. "Formationally, Bill
used flat backs, split backs."

Roman put two fists in front of him at the same length from his body. These were
Walsh's backs lined up side by side. But in the 1980s, Roman explained, colleges
were using I-backs and, to accommodate the backs they drafted, the pros
installed I-back formations.

"Bill never really wavered from flat backs," Roman said. "Plays are read out
differently by the running backs in these types of backfield sets as opposed to
the "I," where the back is seven yards deep. What (Walsh's offense) allows you
to do is involve more two-back free releases by the backs into the routes."

Roman moved his left hand -- one of Walsh's running backs -- into an imaginary
corner route over his head.

"What people do nowadays," he said, "instead of having two backs in the
backfield with one of them running a corner route (the left hand), now they just
split a receiver out and have him run a corner route. But it's the same
principles. The purity of what Bill Walsh did was formationally, two-back
offense, very little one-back, no shotgun."

We're talking evolution here. One of the backs becomes a wide receiver in some
plays. The football genome had evolved past Walsh.

Walsh scripted the first 10 offensive plays, eventually 15, then 20. How many do
the Niners script?

"We'll script 30," Roman said. "Sometimes we go right down the list, and
sometimes we scrap the list. Sometimes we jump around the list based on what the
defense is doing. Every week's different. Some defenses are so multiple, you're
not quite sure what you're going to get. It's a week-to-week outfit. Some
defenses say. 'Hey, this is what we are. This is what we do.' Against those
teams, it's a little easier to figure out a script.

"There's so much multiplicity in this league now in defense week to week, you've
got to be ready to make some adjustments. If what you had planned for does not
show up, you better change quick. Bill Walsh would do the same thing."

The Browns play the same defense every week. It is a make-the-offense-work-hard
defense. If the opposing offense is going to score, the Browns want it to take
12 plays. They put the pressure on the offense not to make drive-killing
mistakes. You can script against a defense like that.

BRIEF: Former LaVale man charged with sex offenses

BYLINE: Cumberland Times News, Md.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 260 words


Mar. 10--CUMBERLAND -- A 43-year-old Bedford, Pa., man was arrested by the C3I
Unit in connection with alleged sex offenses against his juvenile stepdaughter
that occurred over a three-year period.

Tod Anthony Gordon was charged Monday with second-degree rape, second- and
third-degree sex offense, child abuse, sexual abuse of a minor and perverted
practice.

Following a bond hearing, Gordon was jailed in lieu of $150,000 bond, pending a
bail review hearing.

A C3I spokesman said the alleged offenses occurred when the victim was 13 in
February 2002 and continued until August 2005 when the family relocated from
LaVale to Pennsylvania.

The victim told investigators that Gordon had sexual contact with her while her
mother was at work. She also said that he had sexual contact with her an average
of three times a week and more than 100 times during the three-year period.

The victim also alleged that the offenses continued after the family moved to
Pennsylvania. Those allegations are being investigated by Pennsylvania
authorities.

The investigation began after C3I was contacted by the victim, who wanted to
report the alleged offenses.

San Jose employs 'pistol' offense

BYLINE: By Lya Wodraska The Salt Lake Tribune

SECTION: SPORTS; College Sports; Utah Utes

LENGTH: 433 words


With a scoring offense that is the third worst in the country, averaging just 11
points a game, San Jose State hasn't shown much firepower this year.

But the Spartans will at least bring their "pistol" to Salt Lake City.

The Spartans are experimenting with that offense, so named because it is a
variation of the shotgun in which the quarterback lines up closer to the center.

Nevada has used the formation most successfully, but just like the spread and
the wildcat offenses, the trend is catching on in several places.

UCLA is using it some this year, and the Utes did their own experimenting with
it under former offensive coordinator Andy Ludwig .

San Jose State coach Mike MacIntyre installed the offense thanks to his
familiarity with it from his recent days at Duke.

The scheme does present some unique challenges for defenses, Utah coach Kyle
Whittingham said.

"It's more beneficial to the downhill run game than the true shotgun," he said.
"It's a concern, and the play-action pass is too, but the biggest difference is
getting the downhill run game going. It's kind of the best of both worlds
because you have the run and the quarterback has a little extra time to see the
field than when he is under center."

So far, the Spartans haven't had much success with their offense, or any aspect
of their offensive game for that matter.

San Jose State has the fifth-worst total offense in the Football Bowl
Subdivision, averaging just 244 yards a game. The Spartans average 67 yards on
the ground and 177 through the air.



By the numbers

Utah leads the MWC and is ranked in the top 20 in the nation in both passing
efficiency offense and passing efficiency defense. Utah's 177.7 passing
efficiency offense is No. 7 and its 101.8 passing efficiency defense is No. 19.

Utah's passing efficiency is on track to break the school record, set in 2004
when the Utes had a rating of 173.45. Alex Smith set a school record that year
with a passing efficiency of 176.52.

Terrance Cain has a 204.0 passing efficiency rating, which would lead the
nation, but he has not played in the minimum percentage of games required (75
percent).



Why so late?

Often, 6 p.m. kickoffs are reserved for games that are being televised. In the
case of the San Jose State game, which isn't being televised, Utah officials
opted for a later kickoff because they felt a night game would draw more fans.

Utah's other home games are scheduled for earlier kickoffs of 4 p.m. vs. CSU
(Oct. 23), 1:30 p.m. vs. TCU (Nov. 6) and 1:30 p.m. vs. BYU (Nov. 27).

Penn State, Ohio State atop the Big Ten COLLEGE FOOTBALL - BIG TEN PREVIEW

BYLINE: BY STU DURANDO o sdurando@post-dispatch.com > 314-340-8232

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. C6

LENGTH: 686 words

DATELINE: 0


1. PENN STATE

2008 record - 11-2, 7-1 in the Big Ten

Coach - Joe Paterno (383-127-3 in 43 years at Penn State and overall)

Returning starters - 5 offense, 4 defense

Comment - The offense will be powered by returning all-conference QB Daryll
Clark and second-team RB Evan Royster. The defense lost considerable talent, but
the return of LB Sean Lee from an ACL is a boost.

2. OHIO STATE

2008 record - 10-3, 7-1 in the Big Ten

Coach - Jim Tressel (83-19 in 8 years at Ohio State, 218-76-2 in 23 overall)

Returning starters - 5 offense, 7 defense

Comment - The offense now belongs to explosive sophomore QB Terrelle Pryor after
he split the job as a freshman. The Buckeyes must prove they can play with the
best after three 2008 losses to top-10 teams.

3. IOWA

2008 record - 9-4, 5-3 in the Big Ten

Coach - Kirk Ferentz (70-53 in 10 years at Iowa, 82-74 in 13 overall)

Returning starters - 6 offense, 8 defense

Comment - The Hawkeyes allowed the fewest points per game in the conference and
most starters return. Led by QB Ricky Stanzi, the offense might lack pop but
just needs to be efficient. The road schedule is brutal.

4. MICHIGAN STATE

2008 record - 9-4, 6-2 in the Big Ten

Coach - Mark Dantonio (16-10 in 2 years at Michigan State, 34-27 in 5 overall)

Returning starters - 7 offense, 8 defense

Comment - Workhorse RB Javon Ringer is gone and Dantonio must do some rebuilding
on offense. But the defense should be strong with preseason player of the year
Greg Jones, who was among the nation's leaders in tackles.

5. ILLINOIS

2008 record - 5-7, 3-5 in the Big Ten

Coach - Ron Zook (18-30 in 4 years at Illinois, 41-44 in 7 overall)

Returning starters - 8 offense, 6 defense

Comment - The Illini have the Big Ten's best group of receivers and QB Juice
Williams led the conference in total offense in '08. Scoring shouldn't be a
problem, which is good because the defense has a lot to prove.

6. MINNESOTA

2008 record - 7-6, 3-5 in the Big Ten

Coach - Tim Brewster (8-17 in 2 years at Minnesota and overall)

Returning starters - 10 offense, 8 defense

Comment - Adam Weber is one of the more underrated QBs around, and top target
Eric Decker holds the school record for catches in a season. New coordinator
Jedd Fisch will run a pro-style attack, scrapping the spread.

7. NORTHWESTERN

2008 record - 9-4, 5-3 in the Big Ten

Coach - Pat Fitzgerald (19-18 in 3 years at Northwestern and overall)

Returning starters - 5 offense, 8 defense

Comment - It's time for Fitzgerald to prove he's worth the seven-year contract
extension he received. Defense should be the team's backbone, but QB Mike
Kafka's dual-threat ability makes the offense more unpredictable.

8. WISCONSIN

2008 record - 7-6, 3-5 in the Big Ten

Coach - Bret Bielema (28-11 in 3 years at Wisconsin and overall)

Returning starters - 6 offense, 5 defense

Comment - The offense has been altered during camp with expected starters being
replaced at QB and RB. It's a two-man race to run the offense, and Zack Brown is
the frontrunner over John Clay as No. 1 ball carrier.

9. MICHIGAN

2008 record - 3-9, 2-6 in the Big Ten

Coach - Rich Rodriguez (3-9 in 1 year at Michigan, 108-71-2 in 16 overall)

Returning starters - 10 offense, 5 defense

Comment - Rodriguez might put the offense in the hands of a freshman QB, but he
has returning starters at every other spot. A top-10 recruiting class should
start to help fill the holes, giving Michigan a shot at a bowl berth.

10. PURDUE

2008 record - 4-8, 2-6 in the Big Ten

Coach - Danny Hope (1st year at Purdue, 35-22 in 5 overall)

Returning starters - 5 offense, 7 defense

Comment - The Boilermakers hit a low point in Joe Tiller's last season as coach.
They won't have much proven talent at the skill spots, making Hope's first
season a challenge. Early test at Oregon will be telling.

11. INDIANA

2008 record - 3-9, 1-7 in the Big Ten

Coach - Bill Lynch (10-15 in 2 years at Indiana, 91-82-3 in 16 overall)

Returning starters - 8 offense, 9 defense

Comment - The Hoosiers were pounded by injuries and often overwhelmed in '08 a
year after reaching a bowl game. The offense gets a fresh start with QB Ben
Chappell replacing Kellen Lewis, who was dismissed from the team.

Offense is finally in favor

BYLINE: By Roger Clarkson Morris News Service

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. C01

LENGTH: 526 words

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS -


Playing Georgia brought back some fond memories for June Jones.

Hawaii's coach played with the Atlanta Falcons. His first coaching experience
came at a high school in Georgia.

So when the bowl announcements came out and Jones saw the matchup with Georgia
in the Sugar Bowl, he got a chance to reminisce about his first days as a
football coach.

"Went to Forsyth County High School there in northern Georgia, and they hadn't
won a game in two or three years," Jones said. "The coach, Jim Cooper, let me be
offensive coordinator, and we started off 5-0. Then we went to Clarke Central
over there in Athens, and they were ranked No. 1at the time, and they kind of
put it on us. I knew that was something I wanted to do and something I wanted to
be a part of, and I've been doing it sever since."

The run and shoot offense that Jones utilizes with Hawaii is almost identical to
the offense he ran at Forsyth County more than two decades ago. Jones might not
be the inventor of the four-receiver offense, but he is certainly one of the
pioneers, and everybody from the New England Patriots to junior highs now
incorporate some form of the spread offense into their game plans.

"It's almost 20 years ago when I lined up with this offense with Jerry
Glanville, and for about 15 years, it was being bad-mouthed," Jones said. "Now I
look around, and the Patriots and the Colts and people like that are running
what we ran and saying, 'That's how you play the game.' Knowing I was a part of
that with Jerry and Mouse (Davis) gives me a lot of satisfaction. Now everybody
in the National Football League does what we do now. It just so happens that New
England does it every play."

Jones' evolution as a coach started with truncated playing stints at Oregon and
Hawaii, where he was on the field for a total of about 10 plays. He decided to
leave football and enroll at Portland State, where Davis had installed the run
and shoot. Davis talked Jones into returning to football, and he set a
single-season passing record.

"How do you go from three years of never getting onto the field to being a Kodak
All-American as a quarterback?" Jones said. "It was because of the offense."

Jones became a disciple of Davis' run and shoot and spread the gospel when he
was drafted by the Falcons. He has been either an assistant or a head coach in
the USFL, CFL and NFL. He returned to Hawaii in 1999 and transformed the
Warriors into the best program from a non-BCS conference in the country this
season. Now, like in the beginning, Jones' focus is on the offense. Hawaii
quarterback Colt Brennan set 29 NCAA passing records in his three seasons at
Hawaii.

"During practice, he talks about 80 percent of the time, coach talks at Colt,"
Hawaii safety Jacob Patek said. "Then about 20 percent is directed toward
receivers. He sticks to what he does best, which is that run and shoot offense."

Jones resurrected Hawaii's football program and put it on the national map with
a 12-0 regular season in 2007 and the school's first BCS bowl bid. Brennan was a
Heisman Trophy finalist, and Hawaii sold out its 15,000-ticket allotment to the
Sugar Bowl.

SABAN, DOLPHINS LAND LINEHAN

BYLINE: By JOE SCHAD Palm Beach Post Staff Writer

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 1C

LENGTH: 737 words

DATELINE: DAVIE


Hoping Scott Linehan brings the exciting, explosive offense of the Minnesota
Vikings to South Florida, Dolphins coach Nick Saban claimed the free-agent
offensive coordinator Wednesday.

Linehan was ticketed for an evening flight to Jacksonville, where he was to
interview for the same position, but Saban wouldn't allow him to leave town
without agreeing to a three-year deal. So Linehan never boarded the plane.

"Scott is the person we targeted as our first choice," Saban said in a
statement. "His expertise is not only in developing good offensive systems, but
also in raising the level of play of his quarterbacks everywhere he has been."

Linehan, 41, was Minnesota's offensive coordinator the past three seasons. The
Vikings were fourth in the NFL in total offense and second in passing offense
this season. Minnesota was first in the NFL in total offense and fourth in the
league in both passing and rushing offense in 2003.

Linehan (pronounced Lin-uh-han) has been credited with the development of
quarterbacks Daunte Culpepper as well as Dave Ragone and Chris Redman at
Louisville, Brock Huard and Marques Tuiasosopo at Washington and Doug Nussmeier
at Idaho.

The days of Miami's conservative offense may be over. Linehan uses an
aggressive, one-back, spread offense, at times with three wideouts. Linehan has
cited respect for the Redskins offenses under Joe Gibbs in the '80s.

Linehan, whose contract with the Vikings was set to expire and was in high
demand, has worked under John L. Smith at Louisville, Jim Lambright at
Washington and Dennis Erickson at Idaho, where Linehan played quarterback.

The Vikings wanted to re-sign Linehan, but he was seeking long-term security for
his wife and three young sons and a hearty raise the Dolphins provided.

"There's nothing there that's stable," said Linehan, who added that Dolphins
owner Wayne Huizenga has "hired a new coach and given him a very good basis to
retool here. And they're going to give him time to get it done."

Like most offensive coordinators, Linehan has pledged a commitment to the run as
well as a desire to make big plays in the passing game. But unlike many
coordinators, his players have delivered.

Culpepper, whose quarterback rating this season of 110.9 was the fourth-highest
in league history, wanted Linehan to return. Wide receiver Randy Moss thrived
and Linehan showed he wasn't afraid to get the ball to his best players, going
along with what Mike Tice labeled "The Randy Ratio."

Saban also confirmed reports that he hired LSU defensive assistant Travis Jones
and 49ers defensive line coach Dan Quinn and said he had hired Browns
linebackers coach George Edwards.

Former Dolphins defensive line coach Clarence Brooks signed on with the Ravens
in the same role. Packers receivers coach Ray Sherman is expected to interview
in Miami as soon as today.

Anthony faces pot charge Marijuana found in his backpack The player's lawyer
says a friend of the Nuggets star is expected today to lay claim to the drug.

Los Angeles - Nuggets star forward Carmelo Anthony faces a petty-offense charge
after marijuana was found in his backpack during a search at Denver
International Airport last week.

"He is innocent of these charges," his attorney, Dan Reche, said Wednesday
night. "He's devastated by these charges. He feels an obligation to his fans. He
has been an upstanding member of the Nuggets and will continue to be."

Anthony faces a charge of possession of less than 1 ounce of marijuana. The
marijuana allegedly was found in a side pocket when the backpack was hand-
searched before the Nuggets boarded a team flight Friday to Milwaukee for a
preseason game.

The flight left from Signature Flight Support at DIA. Reche said a male friend
of Anthony's is expected to make a statement today taking claim for the
marijuana. Reche declined to reveal Anthony's friend's name.

Anthony declined to comment through team spokesperson Teri Washington.

According to Colorado state law, possession of 1 ounce or less of marijuana is a
Class 2 petty offense. Anthony has received a summons to appear in court on or
before Oct. 29, Reche said. Reche is expected to go to court for Anthony. There
is no possibility of jail time. The maximum penalty for the violation is $100.

According to the National Basketball Association's Collective Bargaining
Agreement, any player who tests positive or is found by an arbitrator to have
possessed marijuana will have to enter the league's marijuana program on the
first offense. A second offense includes a $15,000 fine and the third offense or
more includes a five-game suspension.

An NBA source said Anthony never failed any of the four drug tests he took as a
rookie and passed a recent one as well. Anthony also didn't fail a drug test
during the Athens Olympics.

Rookies are tested once during training camp and up to three times during the
regular season. Veterans are tested only once, which comes during training camp.

Nuggets general manager Kiki Vandeweghe said the franchise supports Anthony.

"The attorney's office is always fair and does a great job," Vandeweghe said. "I
just want all the facts to come to light. I have a lot of confidence in Carmelo.
As I've said, we drug-test guys and we have no reason to believe anything other
than the facts that have been represented."

Reche said he has met with an assistant of the Denver city attorney about the
situation. Reche has asked that the case be dismissed.

"I expect the city attorney to treat him fairly," Vandeweghe said. "We don't
expect any special treatment."

Anthony was on the Nuggets' team flight to Los Angeles on Wednesday for today's
game against the Clippers.

"Carmelo is going to fight it because it's not true," Reche said of the
allegations.

Anthony's latest incident continues a somewhat rocky offseason.

Anthony ended up signing autographs at the Pepsi Center for fans who didn't
receive promised autographs for buying T-shirts during his celebrity charity
game at the University of Denver's Magness Arena. He made national headlines
after he didn't see eye to eye with coach Larry Brown during the Olympics. And
Anthony also reportedly was involved in an altercation on Sept. 13 at a New York
nightclub with rapper Sugar Jay after Sugar Jay spat a drink in the face of
Anthony's girlfriend, LaLa Vasquez.

"This is the last thing he needed," Reche said.

------------------------------------------------------------------ NBA policy

Here is the NBA's policy on marijuana, according to Article XXXIII of the
Collective Bargaining Agreement:

Any player who (i) tests positive for marijuana ..., (ii) is adjudged by the
Grievance Arbitrator ... to have used or possessed marijuana or (iii) has been
convicted of (including a plea of guilty, no contest or nolo contendere to) the
use or possession of marijuana in violation of the law, shall suffer the
following penalties:

(a) For the first violation, the player shall be required to enter the marijuana
program;

(b) For the second violation, the player shall be fined $15,000 and required to
enter the marijuana program;

(c) For the third and any subsequent violation, the player shall be suspended
five games and required to enter the marijuana program.

NFL: Notes

BYLINE: The Salt Lake Tribune

SECTION: SPORTS

LENGTH: 708 words


Tonight's game

Green Bay at New Orleans

* Why you should tune in: Offense, offense, offense. The Packers and the Saints
are ranked fourth and fifth, respectively, in points per game.

* Why you shouldn't tune in: You prefer highly defensive, 7-6 games on Monday
night.

* The line: Saints by 1.

* The pick: Saints. Level of certainty: 4. In a seemingly evenly matched game,
New Orleans gets the edge simply for being at home.

Fantasy surprise

Buffalo quarterback Trent Edwards threw for 273 yards and two touchdowns and
also ran for two touchdowns.

Sunday's winners

COWBOYS: This is just what Dallas needed: A rout in which the offense exploded.
With the hapless Seahawks coming up on Thanksgiving, the resurgent Cowboys can
enter the stretch run with some momentum.

VIKNGS: With the NFC North log-jammed, Minnesota couldn't afford to lose at
Jacksonville. The Vikes shut down the Jaguars' running game - good experience
going into next week's showdown at Chicago.

FALCONS: In another division where losses are costly, Atlanta pulled within a
game of first place by defeating Carolina 45-28. Furthermore, Michael Turner
clearly has emerged as the league's best offseason acquisition.

And losers

EAGLES: How bad did Donovan McNabb play? He was benched for Kevin Kolb. Their
teammates weren't much better, as Philadelphia's only TD was on a kickoff
return. Stick a fork in the Eagles in the NFC East; they're done.

BRONCOS: Denver is fortunate to play in such a weak division, but it doesn't say
much when you are weakly leading the weak division. Losing to the Raiders at
Invesco is simply embarrassing.

CARDINALS: Granted, Arizona was playing the defending Super Bowl champs, but the
Cards came up against an elite team and lost. With the loss, their hopes of a
playoff bye might have been dashed, too.

Key injuries

* Marc Bulger, QB, Rams, concussion

* Plaxico Burress, WR, Giants, reaggravated right hamstring injury

* Drew Stanton, QB, Lions, concussion

* Mike Brown, S, Bears, leg

* Desmond Clark, TE, Bears, knee

* Nathan Vasher, CB, Bears, thumb

* Ahman Green, RB, Texans, left knee

* Greg Camarillo, WR, Dolphins, knee

* Allen Rossum, KR, 49ers, sprained right ankle

* Nick Leckey, C, Rams, ankle

Bulger uncertain for next week

Marc Bulger sustained a concussion on a sack in the team's first series against
visiting Chicago on Sunday, and his status for next week's game was uncertain.

Bulger was unavailable after the game, but coach Jim Haslett thought the
quarterback's condition had improved before the end of the game, saying, ''I
thought he looked fine in the second half.''

Center Brett Romberg was also optimistic about Bulger's chances to play next
week against Miami. Bulger missed four games last season, two with a concussion
believed to be the first of any severity in his career, and two with broken
ribs.

''He got zinged on that first drive,'' Romberg said.

''I don't think it's crazy serious or anything, but he definitely was a little
bothered.''

Bulger lasted only five plays in a 27-3 loss to the Bears. He was hurt when the
Bears' Adewale Ogunleye came in untouched for an 8-yard loss to end the first
possession and finished 2-for-2 for 11 yards.

The Bears intercepted backup quarterback Trent Green four times and
third-stringer Brock Berlin was 1-for-3 for 6 yards.

Haslett addressed fan sentiment against Bulger the last several weeks, noting
that Bulger's backups also failed to produce.

''Anybody else want another quarterback?'' Haslett said.

- The Associated Press

Beyond the box score

* New England's Matt Cassel became the fifth quarterback to throw for 400 yards
in consecutive games, joining Dan Fouts, Dan Marino, Phil Simms and Billy Volek.

* Jets quarterback Brett Favre broke a tie with Dan Marino for victories in the
most NFL stadiums by winning in his 32nd at LP Field.

* Tampa Bay's Carnell ''Cadillac'' Williams had 27 yards rushing on 16 carries
in his first game since a knee injury almost ended his career 14 months ago,
helping the Buccaneers beat Detroit 38-20.

* Kurt Warner topped 300 yards for the fifth consecutive game, one shy of Steve
Young's NFL record, in Arizona's 37-29 loss to the New York Giants.

* Kyle Orton set a franchise record by throwing 185 consecutive passes without
an interception in Chicago's 27-3 win at St. Louis.

Purdy: Stanford football wins with old-school offense

BYLINE: By Mark Purdy Mercury News Columnist

SECTION: SPORTS; Breaking; Columnists; News; Columnists

LENGTH: 718 words


Stanford, as a university, is the home of innovation and cutting-edge thinking.

Stanford, as a football program, is the home of traditionalism and cutting off
right tackle.

I confirmed this again Tuesday, as the new college season approaches. I asked
Cardinal coach David Shaw if he had ever considered switching from the team's
longtime prostyle West Coast offense to the spread offense that is all the rage
in college football today.

"No," Shaw said quickly, then twitched his neck a bit. "You just kind of gave me
the shivers there."

Really, you'd have to call this one of the great cultural anomalies in sports:

Here is Stanford football, located in whiz-bang Silicon Valley full of
revolutionary technology.

Here is Stanford football, playing in the whiz-bang Pacific-12 Conference full
of wild flash-and-dash-and-fling offensive attacks.

And yet here is Stanford football, running basically the same offense that Shaw
first learned when he played wide receiver for the Cardinal in the early '90s.
If the Stanford offense were a mobile device, it would still be a pager.

Of course, if a pager still gets the job done, why buy an iPhone?

"I ran the spread in high school," quarterback Kevin Hogan said. "It was fun.
But I like what our offense does here. ... I've talked to guys from other
schools, and they're in awe of what we do. ... We like to line up and tell you
we're running the ball and tell you where we're running it and see if you can
stop it."

The answer is almost always no. That's a big reason why Stanford, once more, is
ranked so high in preseason polls -- No. 6 by the Sporting News, No. 11 by
Associated Press, No. 12 by Athlon. The only other schools that have won at
least 10 games in each of the past four seasons are Alabama, Florida State and
Oregon.

The Stanford defense is also a big factor in the team's success. But the offense
is responsible for the scoreboard numbers trending in the right direction. Last
season, Stanford gained 2,904 yards on the ground, best in school history.

Shaw enjoys defending the offense to folks who suggest that Stanford is in
danger of becoming too predictable or stuck in a rut. He notes that his
offensive philosophy was developed while he either played or served as an
assistant coach for the likes of Bill Walsh, Dennis Green, Brian Billick and Jon
Gruden.

None of them, you may recall, was considered a conservative football
fundamentalist.

"I call myself a West Coast purist," Shaw said. "But there are principles of the
spread offense that can be found in the West Coast offense. ... If you're a
longtime 49er watcher, as I am, you can look back and see that every year Bill
Walsh was there, he did something a little different in terms of the way he used
the personnel and the way he attacked defenses."

And so it will be in 2014 for the Cardinal. But if there were ever a season when
spread-offense principles might find a home at Stanford, it would appear to be
this one. After the departure of big bell-cow runner Tyler Gaffney, Shaw has
decided that the top backfield spot will be rotated among five smaller guys.
Also, the Cardinal returns Hogan at quarterback along with a talented group of
experienced wide receivers.

It sounds like a perfect setup to send out all of that skill into the secondary
to find open spaces and have Hogan fire the ball. We could see some of that. But
it seems we'll be looking at the grunt work still setting the tone.

The only other Pac-12 teams with prostyle offenses are USC and Oregon State. In
most conferences, the ratio is the same. It makes you wonder how Shaw goes into
living rooms and persuades quarterback and wideout recruits to sign up for four
or five years of the Cardinal method.

"There are certain places that tout statistics," Shaw said. "We talk about
preparing to play at the next level. The No. 1 question they often ask about
quarterbacks is, can you read our NFL defenses? And that's all we train our
quarterbacks to do."

Hogan, who has NFL ambitions, has never once been jealous of his spread-offense
opponents -- for the same reason.

"If I'm lucky enough to have an opportunity at the next level, that should help
me," he said.

Sadly, before Hogan could elaborate, his interview session was over and he left
the room. I think he heard his pager buzzing.

Offensive players score on payday, too

BYLINE: Larry Weisman; MaryJo Sylwester

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 1C

LENGTH: 353 words

Defense wins championships. That's what they say in the NFL.

But that's not how they pay.

USA TODAY's annual analysis of NFL player compensation looked at the
apportioning of salary-cap dollars following a second Super Bowl victory in
three years by the defensive-minded New England Patriots. Even as the Patriots
dominated by dint of their defense, the league trended toward more spending on
offense.


On average, the 32 teams directed nearly 53% of their cap dollars in 2003 to
offense, just as they did in 2002 and up from 52% in 2000 and '01. Twenty-one
favored offense in their spending, up from 19 the previous year. The
Indianapolis Colts earmarked the highest percentage (69%) for offense; the Miami
Dolphins led for defense (66%). The Patriots put 54% into defense.

"In the salary-cap era, you probably can win with a veteran defense that's
cap-heavy and a lower-paid, younger offense, which the Patriots have done,"
Colts President Bill Polian says. "It works."

But not for everybody. Of the 10 teams with the highest percentage of cap
dollars dedicated to defense, only three -- the Seattle Seahawks, Philadelphia
Eagles and Patriots -- made the playoffs. Of the 48 teams qualifying for the
playoffs in the last four years, 32 spent more on offense than defense.

Polian said he believes in defense as the key to the Super Bowl. But "what you
do boils down to what access to exceptional talent you have," he said. "If you
draft a quarterback first -- and that's the approach we took with Peyton Manning
in 1998 -- you set sail on a course you almost can't reverse."

Manning, receiver Marvin Harrison and running back Edgerrin James, all top
performers at their positions, consumed almost 36% of the Colts' $ 75 million
cap last year as the club reached the AFC Championship Game.

The database analysis showed NFL teams employed 1,019 offensive players and 941
defensive in 2003. The difference averages out to more than two players a team,
accounting in part for the tilt in cap dollars. The other factor? Quarterbacks,
who have the highest average salary ($ 2.15 million).

Big 12 efficiency rankings: OU offense on historic run

BYLINE: Berry Tramel

SECTION:

LENGTH: 640 words


[img width="" height="" style="" render="w620"]4513606[/img]Who knows what will
happen Thursday night in Ames? But for now, OU's offense is performing at an
historic rate. The Sooners' offensive efficiency is up to a percentage of .547,
which means OU is averaging a touchdown on more than half its possessions.You
measure efficiency by the percentage by which an offense scores (or a defense
prevents a score) in the number of possessions offered. Touchdowns count full,
field goals count half.

The great Big 12 offenses of recent years have posted offensive efficiencies in
the .400s. And these Sooners are in the mid-.500s.Here are the current numbers
in the Big 12:OFFENSE1. Oklahoma .547: The Sooner offense hasn't been slowed by
any Big 12 team, but OU still has yet to face the top three efficient
defenses.2. Texas Tech .450: The Red Raiders scored just two touchdowns in 10
regulation possessions at TCU but still got a victory.3, Baylor .425: Bears
still living off a big offensive game in Ames. They haven't been nearly as
efficient in recent games against Iowa State and Texas.4. Oklahoma State .424:
The Cowboy offense was good against West Virginia but got a lot of help from the
OSU defense.5. West Virginia .398: The Mountaineer offense isn't quite the
caliber of the Southwest machines.6. Texas .359: UT's offense was best against
OSU and OU but has slipped since then.7. Kansas State .357: The Wildcat offense
has virtually the same effectiveness as Texas', it's just achieved in vastly
different ways.8. TCU .313: The Horned Frog offense has looked good this year
only against Oklahoma.9. Iowa State.298: The Cyclone offense looked much better
early in the conference season. &nbsp;I'm detecting a trend.10. Kansas .144: The
Jayhawks actually moved the ball at times on OU.DEFENSE1. West Virginia .279:
The Mountaineers would have an ever better number if its offense hadn't set up
OSU in great field position.2. Baylor .304: The Bears have played the Big 12's
two worst offenses. This number will rise.3. Oklahoma State .311: The Cowboys
held West Virginia at bay. But OU and Tech are still to come.4. TCU .321:
&nbsp;The Horned Frogs held Texas Tech in check, making you think Gary
Patterson's defense is rounding into form.5. Texas .352: The Longhorn defense
was awful against OSU and OU but has played much better since.6. Oklahoma .358:
Kansas makes all numbers improve, and now OU gets Iowa State.7. Kansas State
.370: Against OU and Tech, the Wildcats' defensive efficiency number is .478,
and now comes OSU's similar offense.8. Kansas .421: The Jayhawks have played the
Big 12's four best offenses. This number will get better. &nbsp;9. Iowa State
.431: The Cyclones gave up four touchdowns and one field goal in nine Kansas
State possessions last week. That's no better efficiency than TCU gave up to OU
in a 52-46 game.10. Texas Tech .456: Tech's defense showed some life against
TCU.PROJECTIONSOne tool you can use with these numbers is to project a final
score for games. Sometimes it's off, and you know it's off even before kickoff -
for instance, OU was projected a 46-30 victor over Kansas last week, and it
seemed unlikely that KU could score that much. But the projections did foresee
Tech's upset of TCU. Here are this week's games:Oklahoma at Iowa State: Sooners
41-29. Can OU score this much with Joe Mixon back in Norman?Oklahoma State at
Kansas State: Cowboys 30-24. I can see this score. Both offenses will be
efficient, but K-State condenses the game. Not a ton of possessions.Kansas at
West Virginia: Mountaineers 36-18. Actually seems about right, if KU's defense
can hold up.TCU at Baylor: Bears 34-27. The Frogs' have sort of basic numbers,
which in the Big 12 puts them behind the crowd.Texas at Texas Tech: Red Raiders
35-34. Actually, the projection was Tech 34.806, Texas 34.472.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Offense near top of national rankings

BYLINE: Gina Mizell

SECTION: SPORTS; OSU FOOTBALL NOTEBOOK; Pg. 5C

LENGTH: 388 words



The Oklahoma State offense has so far lived up to the expectations as one of the
top units, statistically, in the nation, especially in the passing game.

After three weeks, the Cowboys rank second in the country in total offense (601
yards per game) while tying for first with Houston in passing offense (408 yards
per game).

"We like to think we're hard to stop," OSU quarterback Brandon Weeden said. "We
like to think we're an elite offense. Whether we are or not, we think we are.
That's half the battle, just getting the confidence.

"As an offense, we're not cocky, but we're very comfortable."

Weeden leads the nation with 384.67 passing yards per game.

BROWN SHOWS KNACK FOR DRAMATIC PLAY

Brodrick Brown is starting to get a reputation for coming up with
highlight-worthy plays in the secondary.

On the second play of the third quarter Sunday, Tulsa tried to slip a trick play
past the Cowboys when receiver Genesis Cole caught a backward pass and then
lofted the ball to a wide-open Willie Carter near the OSU 35-yard line. But
Brown bolted toward Carter from the opposite side of the field, stretched out
his arms to make the interception on the run and finished the play off with a
somersault.

"I just saw the guy wide open, so I just took off across the field and I was
there for the interception," Brown said.

Brown was nominated for an ESPY award this past year for his play against
Oklahoma last season where he leapt into the Sooners' sideline to tip a Landry
Jones pass back inbounds for a Shaun Lewis interception.

TOP-10 MATCHUP RARE FOR COWBOYS, AGGIES

OSU and Texas A&M may meet for the last time as Big 12 opponents Saturday, but
it will be the first time they will square off with both the No. 7 Cowboys and
No. 8 Aggies ranked in the top 10 in the nation.

It's also the first time two top-10 teams have played at Kyle Field since 1975,
when the No. 2 Aggies beat fifth-ranked Texas 20-10 to clinch a share of the
Southwest Conference title.

OSU is 0-2 in matchups of top-10 teams during the Mike Gundy era, with both
games coming on the road in 2008. The then-No. 7 Cowboys lost 28-24 at No. 1
Texas, then dropped a 56-20 decision at Texas Tech two weeks later as the
nation's eighth-ranked team.

OSU's last road victory against a top-10 team also came in 2008, when the
Cowboys won at No. 3 Missouri, 28-23.

TWO MEN CHARGED OVER BOMB CONSPIRACY

SECTION: First Edition; NEWS; Pg. 5

LENGTH: 465 words


Two men appeared in court yesterday accused of plotting to mount a terrorist
bomb attack on Britain.

One of the men is accused of possessing a video showing how to make a car bomb,
while the other allegedly had a recipe for rocket propellants and guidance on
causing an explosion.

A DVD entitled Martyrdom Operations Vest was also allegedly possessed by one of
the men.

The pair, who are both 22, appeared before Bow Street Magistrates Court in
central London, charged with a series of offences, including conspiracy to cause
an explosion and conspiracy to murder.

Waseem Mughal and Younis Tsouli are also accused of conspiracy to cause a public
nuisance and of a range of terrorism offences.

They were arrested by anti-terror police last month and have been held at
Paddington Green Police Station for two weeks.

They appeared at Bow Street with a third man, 19year-old Tariq Al-Daour, who is
also accused of offences under the Terrorism Act.

All three were remanded in custody to appear before the Old Bailey on November
18.

Mughal is charged with a total of ten offences, Tsouli a total of eight and
Al-Daour is charged with three offences.

None of the men is thought to be British-born.

One of the charges against Mughal, who was arrested on October 21, alleges that
he had, in his bedroom, a DVD entitled Martyrdom Operations Vest.

Another alleges that he had a piece of paper with the words "welcome to jihad"
written on it, while a further charge alleges that he possessed a piece of paper
containing the words "hospital attack".

Mughal is also charged with possessing information about a recipe for rocket
propellant and guidance on causing an explosion.

The conspiracy to murder charge alleges that, before October 31 this year, he,
with Tsouli and others, conspired together to murder a person unknown.

The conspiracy to cause an explosion charge alleges that he "unlawfully and
maliciously" conspired together with Tsouli and others to cause an explosion of
a nature likely to endanger life in the United Kingdom.

Tsouli is accused in the charges of having in his bedroom a "video slide film"
on a computer hard drive showing how to make a car bomb.

He faces a further charge of possessing a video showing a number of places in
Washington DC and including a CRBN (chemical, radiological, biological and
nuclear) vehicle.

Al-Daour faces two charges under the terrorism act relating to the possession of
money or other property for the purposes of terrorism and fundraising.

All three men all charged with conspiracy to obtain money by deception. They are
alleged to have conspired to dishonestly obtain property from other people's
credit cards.

There was no application for bail on behalf of any of the three men

Meyer hires new assistant on offense;
Iowa State's Herman to take over as offensive coordinator, QB coach.;
OHIO STATE FOOTBALL

BYLINE: By Bill Rabinowitz

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. C1

LENGTH: 325 words


Iowa State assistant coach Tom Herman was hired to lead Ohio State's transition
to a spread offense.

COLUMBUS - As the present Ohio State football team began practicing Friday for
its final game under Luke Fickell, the Buckeyes of the Urban Meyer era added a
big piece to their future.

Ohio State hired Iowa State offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach Tom
Herman to fill that same job for the Buckeyes as they transition to a spread
offense.

Herman, 35, is considered one of college coaching's rising stars. A Mensa
member, Herman was the offensive coordinator of a Rice Owls team in 2008 that
rewrote that school's thin offensive record book. In three seasons at Iowa
State, Herman didn't have as much success statistically. Usually bottom-feeders
in the Big 12, the Pinstripe Bowl-bound Cyclones ranked 55th nationally in total
offense this year using a redshirt freshman most of the season. In 2010, the
Cyclones were 99th in total offense and 97th in scoring offense.

But there were glimpses this year of what Herman's offense could do, especially
if he has better personnel. Iowa State scored 37 points in a stunning
double-overtime upset of Oklahoma State, a loss that kept the Cowboys out of the
BCS title game.

The Cyclones almost always used the shotgun formation. Sometimes, they employed
a no-huddle offense, called "Jet tempo," that resembles Oregon's ultra-fast
pace.

"Tom Herman has one of the bright young minds in college football," Meyer said
in a statement. "His philosophies are very similar to those of my own. I spoke
to numerous colleagues about Tom and all had great things to say about him."

Meyer is not expected to retain most coaches on the current staff, which
nonetheless is back at work for Florida.

"It's difficult. I'm not going to lie to you," said Fickell, who will remain on
staff, though he again declined to confirm that it will be as defensive
coordinator. "But we're all professionals and we all have to handle it."

Trying to Put Fun Back in Longhorns Football

BYLINE: By PETE THAMEL

SECTION: Section SP; Column 0; Sports Desk; Pg. 10

LENGTH: 1061 words


AUSTIN, Tex. -- Mack Brown does not like late-night phone calls because they
usually mean that something bad has happened to one of his Texas football
players. So when his phone woke him well after midnight on Jan. 2, 2007, Brown
dreaded answering.

But instead of bearing bad news, Brown's stepson could barely contain himself.
''You can't believe Boise,'' he told a sleepy Brown. ''Unbelievable.''

Like many others, Brown turned off his television and went to bed after
Oklahoma's Marcus Walker seemingly sealed the Fiesta Bowl with a last-minute
interception return for a touchdown.

Brown recalled the moment in a recent interview in his office, as he discussed
the wholesale changes in the Longhorns' program after their inexplicable 5-7
season. Brown came to the conclusion that blue-blood Texas needed to be more
like blue-turf Boise State, which led to the hiring of the Broncos' offensive
coordinator, Bryan Harsin.

''I decided that I just love what they do and I can't wait to see it at Texas,''
Brown said.

As he enters his 14th season as the Texas coach, Brown faces more question marks
than usual. To execute his makeover, Brown hired Harsin to be a co-coordinator
with Major Applewhite, and Manny Diaz from Mississippi State as the defensive
coordinator.

''I really wanted to start over,'' Brown said.

''I wanted aggressive, young, out-of-the box, confident guys who would come in
here and let Texas fans and our kids have fun again,'' he added. We didn't have
fun last year, including me.''

Brown, who will turn 60 this summer, sees opportunity in adversity. ''If we ever
talk about rebuilding, that is what we're doing right now,'' he said. ''We're
starting over.''

Much of the program's identity on offense will be developed by Harsin, the
bookish coordinator who was 29 when he called the Statue of Liberty play that
clinched the Fiesta Bowl victory for Boise State. Brown has embraced the culture
of the Broncos' aggressive and innovative offense, allowing Harsin to create
what Brown calls ''a Texas offense around the Boise system.''

Brown said: ''I want what they've got at Boise in our offense. I like exactly
what they do.''

Boise's offense is high scoring, but it is not a spread offense, which has
become popular in the past decade. Brown said part of the reason he hired Harsin
was that he wanted to do something different. Texas will run a multiple two-back
system with a fullback and a tight end and an emphasis on running the ball,
which the Longhorns failed to establish last year.

Brown envied the range of Boise State's offense, which could go no-huddle with
five wide receivers as easily as it could gash for inches in short yardage. He
also marveled that the Broncos could run an option play they had not shown in
six weeks and execute it perfectly. Brown said he loved when Harsin told him
that it took as much time to practice a trick play as it does a short pass.

''They've run the ball the last three years for about 200 yards per game,''
Brown said, ''and they've thrown the ball last year for 200 yards per game.
That's what I want. I want the innovation. They're amazing to me that they're so
multiple.''

Harsin, 34, is still adjusting to the glare of Longhorns football. He had his
welcome-to-Texas moment when he arrived for his interview and had his movements
tracked by reporters online every step of the way. The Boise State assistant
Brent Pease called Harsin and was able to walk him through his day, right down
to a bathroom trip when he got off the private jet.

''That was a little bit of a shock to me,'' he said of the intense coverage.
''You knew right then and there that the attention is different from that
standpoint.''

Diaz, 36, was a little more accustomed to the glare. His father, also named
Manny Diaz, was a two-term mayor of Miami and in 2000 represented the American
family of the 6-year-old shipwreck survivor Elian Gonzalez, who was eventually
returned to his father in Cuba.

The younger Diaz also worked at ESPN as a production assistant for N.F.L. shows,
finding himself more interested in drawing up plays than the nuances of
television. He never played college football but turned a graduate assistant job
at Florida State into a most improbable modern coaching path.

Brown is thrilled with the multiplicity of Diaz's defense, which he said is
similar to Rex Ryan's with the Jets. After Brown made inquiries about Diaz, he
said, three Southeastern Conference head coaches, without prompting, suggested
that he hire Diaz. Brown also found online video clips of Diaz talking at
clinics and coaching players.

''I got interviews without ever talking to these guys,'' Brown said, referring
to YouTube.

The game film of Diaz's defenses was equally impressive.

''It's all over the place,'' he said. ''It's disguise, it's simple, but it's
really aggressive.''

Diaz said he was blown away by the passion in Texas, as he sees youngsters in
his neighborhood playing football in full pads. ''It's February,'' he said. ''I
don't even know what they're doing.''

He added: ''Football is very important in a lot of places. I don't know if
there's a place in the country where it means as much as it does in the state of
Texas.''

That is what made last season so difficult, and Brown shouldered a lot of the
blame. Coming off a loss in the Bowl Championship Series title game, Brown said,
he did not handle it well and felt down for too long. He said the program took
on the attitude that ''we'll win our 10'' games.

''As I look back, I can't remember not working,'' he said. ''I can't remember
not being excited about spring and all that. But obviously, there was something
that I missed.''

Brown said he brought in outside consultants to evaluate the program's talent,
and he essentially audited each recruit -- from his film to his character -- to
see if he had missed patterns.

''Every case where we made a mistake, I tried to look and see if there were red
flags that we ignored, or did we just want him?'' he said. Brown concluded that
obvious signs like poor grades were ignored.

Brown hired a strength coach, Bennie Wylie, who he said increased the off-season
energy. Wylie, 34, laughs at the players as he outworks them. Brown compared his
physique to that of a superhero.

''I told him I wouldn't take my shirt off in front of him,'' Brown said with a
laugh.

The new faces, however, have Brown re-energized, with no chance of nodding off.

Illinois Man Charged with Child Exploitation Offenses

LENGTH: 415  words

DATELINE: New York



 Washington: Office for the United States Attorneys, District of Connecticut has
issued the following news release:



  Deirdre M. Daly, United States Attorney for the District of Connecticut,
Matthew J. Etre, Special Agent in Charge of Homeland Security Investigations
(HSI) in Boston, and Chief Vincent DeMaio of the Clinton Police Department,
announced that a federal grand jury in Bridgeport returned an indictment today
charging ARTURO CASTRO, 52, of Wilmette, Illinois, with multiple child
exploitation offenses.





 As alleged in court documents and statements made in court, in approximately
December 2013, CASTRO began communicating with a 15-year-old female in
Connecticut through "Chess with Friends," and online app.  Using the app's chat
option, CASTRO asked the minor victim to send him naked photographs of herself,
and subsequently enticed the minor victim to create videos depicting the minor
victim engaged in sexually explicit conduct and send those videos to CASTRO.  In
March 2014, CASTRO traveled from Illinois to Connecticut and engaged in illicit
sexual activity with the minor victim.



 The indictment charges CASTRO with one count of coercion and enticement of a
minor to engage in sexual activity, an offense that carries a mandatory minimum
term of imprisonment of 10 years and a maximum term of imprisonment of life; one
count of travel in interstate commerce with intent to engage in illicit sexual
activity with a minor, an offense that carries a maximum term of imprisonment of
30 years; and one count of receipt of child pornography, an offense that carries
a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of five years and a maximum term of
imprisonment of 20 years.



 CASTRO was arrested on December 13, 2016, in Wilmette, Illinois.  In a
detention hearing earlier today in U.S. District Court for the Northern District
of Illinois, in Chicago, CASTRO was detained pending trial and ordered removed
to the District of Connecticut.



 U.S. Attorney Daly stressed that an indictment is not evidence of guilt.
Charges are only allegations, and a defendant is presumed innocent unless and
until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.



 This matter is being investigated by Homeland Security Investigations in New
Haven and Chicago, and the Clinton (Conn.) Police Department.  The case is being
prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Jacabed Rodriguez-Coss.

Rams offense is always in the zone

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 27

LENGTH: 716 words


Best offense ever.

Wow. That covers a lot of NFL territory. In fact, it covers all NFL territory.

But those are the words being used by some members of the national media to
describe the St. Louis Rams' offensive juggernaut this season.

Fox TV analyst and former Oakland Raiders coach John Madden recently told Sports
Illustrated, "I think it's the best offense in the history of football."

ESPN's Tom Jackson said, "Kurt Warner and the Rams may be the best story in the
history of the league."

Even the opposition is impressed.

"The Rams' offense is awesome," says Atlanta Falcons defensive tackle Travis
Hall.

"They are so powerful on offense that if you stop one thing, they get you with
another," says Falcons cornerback Ray Buchanan.

There's little wonder why people are getting so caught up in the Rams' ability
to produce points and yardage. Before Sunday's rematch with the Falcons at the
Trans World Dome, the Rams led the league in total offense, averaging 505.4
yards a game; in points scored (217), and in average points per game (43.4).

Then they went out and totaled 529 yards while beating the Falcons 45-29.

The Rams have scored 30 or more points in an NFL-record 12 consecutive
regular-season games. That's five more games than the previous record, shared by
the 1956 Chicago Bears, 1963 Green Bay Packers and 1968 Cleveland Browns.

Quarterback Kurt Warner and running back Marshall Faulk are on pace to break
just about every single-season offensive record imaginable. And a few records
nobody ever imagined would be broken.

So after years of being one of the NFL's forgotten teams - and deservedly so -
the Rams are dazzling almost everyone with their explosive firepower.

Almost everyone. There remains one group that still isn't all that impressed.
One group that is not convinced this Rams' offense is the best of all time.

It's the Rams' offense.

"That's what they think," says Faulk. "I'll let you think that; I'll let you say
that. But for me, I don't know.

"I didn't get to see some of the early offenses before ours," says Faulk, who
has 1,083 yards of total offense this season and is on pace for 2,888, which
would shatter his own NFL mark of 2,429 set last season. "I've only been
watching football since I was maybe 6 or 7.

"But I know one thing - when we go out there, we feel like we can score when we
want to score and we can do what we want to do. If anything's going to happen
with us, we'll stop ourselves by not executing."

Which has seldom been a problem for the Rams this season. But even Warner, who
is on pace to pass for an NFL-record 6,032 yards (the current mark is 5,084 by
Dan Marino in 1984) hasn't bought into the "best ever" tag just yet.

"My feeling is that that's their opinion," Warner says. "I don't know. I don't
think about it. I mean, if we're done playing, and they look back and say, 'Hey,
this team was the greatest offense,' then great. But if they don't, then who
cares?

"It's all an opinion. Different eras, different times. How do you even decipher
all that?" wonders  Warner, who Sunday tied the NFL record of six consecutive
300-yard games. "If we can win another Super Bowl, win a few more Super Bowls
down the road, then maybe you can say we're the best offense, the best team in
the league.

"That's what we're shooting for."

Wide receiver Isaac Bruce is on pace for 1,845 receiving yards this season. The
NFL record is 1,848 by Jerry Rice in 1995. But Bruce is another St. Louis player
who doesn't care about labeling the Rams' record offense as the best ever. He
just wants it to keep going and going and going.

"Let's hope that it doesn't stop," says Bruce. "We are just out there trying to
execute to the best of our ability.

"We know that we are going to play the whole game, regardless," says Bruce.
"Coach (Mike) Martz is not going to take out the first-team players, so we know
that our job is to just go out there and continue to put points on the board."

Which they've done at a record-setting pace. But how long can that continue?

"Hopefully, we can keep it up for as long as we need to," says Warner. "As long
as our offense has to score 40 points, I think our offense will be up to the
task.

"I have the ultimate belief that we can do just that."

As far as everyone else is concerned, they're already believers.

Time to check in on the Big 12 efficiency ratings, and as the weather cools, the
numbers come into better and better focus. This much is clear. It's an offensive
league.The way to win in the Big 12 is offense. The top offenses are Baylor, TCU
and Kansas State, the three schools tied atop the league standings.

The top defenses are Texas and West Virginia (with Baylor tying the
Mountaineers). The Longhorns are struggling just to make a bowl, and the WVU is
6-4.The way to win in the Big 12 is to score.Here are the ratings, and remember,
efficiency measures how often an offensive scores, with half credit for a field
goal, and how often a defense gets off the field without allowing a
score:OFFENSIVE EFFICIENCY1. Baylor .452: The Bears haven't been pristine every
Saturday, but they're rounding into form. No telling what they might score on
Texas Tech come Thanksgiving weekend.2. TCU .434: The Frogs aren't far behind
when it comes to offense. The Frogs get Iowa State in the season finale. Ouch.3.
Kansas State .417: Finally, the KSU offense was knocked down a peg. Good night
for the TCU defense.4. Oklahoma .348: The Sooners have a good offense. Good
isn't good enough in the Big 12.5. West Virginia .299: The Mountaineers are a
major offensive disappointment. They played very well against Alabama and
Oklahoma before October but have struggled in recent weeks.6. Texas Tech .268:

guesstimate the approximate score. Here are this week's games:OU at Texas Tech:
Sooners 38-28. I can see this. I actually think it will be higher-scoring, at
least on OU's end, but this is the neighborhood. Of course, who knows who will
quarterback either team?Texas at OSU: Longhorns 28-19. Seems a little high
scoring team. I'd say more like 18-9.TCU at Kansas: Horned Frogs 38-23. Might be
snowing, so the Frogs might not break the bank.

Offense flourishing with little help from defense

BYLINE: By Sean McClelland Staff Writer

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. B10

LENGTH: 471 words


BEREA - The Cleveland Browns have the NFL's sixthbest offense and are averaging
28 points per game. Amazingly, they are doing this despite ranking
second-to-last in the league in time of possession.

Just imagine if the defense could get itself off the field how many more
opportunities there would be for the offense.

No defense has been on the field longer, and it's not just because the Browns
always score quickly. They have mounted long drives only to see opposing teams
return the favor. The defense sits dead last in the league, yielding 410 yards
per game.

Interceptions by Leigh Bodden sealed the Cincinnati and St. Louis wins. But
except for a 99-yard kickoff return by Josh Cribbs, all the points have been
scored by the offense.

"There are some fundamentals and techniques that we need to do better," Browns
head coach Romeo Crennel said. "We can concentrate on those things, and if we
can do those better, we'll improve. But if we don't do them better, we'll stay
right where we are."

Offense and defense sometimes work hand-in-hand. Of the NFL's top six offenses,
New England, Dallas, Indianapolis and Pittsburgh also rank among the top six
defenses. Only Cleveland and Cincinnati do not.

The Steelers, next week's opponent for Cleveland, have the league's No. 1
defense. The average time of possession against Pittsburgh is 25:40 per game,
almost eight minutes fewer than teams are averaging against the Browns.

Jurevicius' dad OK

William Jurevicius, father of Browns receiver Joe Jurevicius, is out of the
hospital following Monday's serious automobile accident. Joe missed some
practice time this week to be with his dad.

"I don't feel I've missed anything," he said. "I've got every reason to believe
I'll be caught up."

Sunday marks Joe Jurevicius' first game against Seattle since he left to join
the Browns in 2006. In his one season with the Seahawks, he caught a career-high
55 passes for 694 yards and a careerhigh 10 touchdowns while helping them reach
the Super Bowl.

Earning respect

The Browns ascended to 13th in the ESPN.com power rankings this week. Other
national outlets also had them in that vicinity. After a season-opening drubbing
by Pittsburgh, they had been No. 32 on most boards. On ESPN Radio's "Mike and
Mike" morning show, the Browns were named "biggest surprise" of the season.

Injury update

Looks like the Browns will be without inside linebacker D'Qwell Jackson (ankle)
and key special teamer Kris Griffin (Achilles). Neither has practiced. Jackson
is their leading tackler, Griffin their leading special teams tackler. Leon
Williams would start in Jackson's spot with backup Chaun Thompson seeing
increased action.

McNabb not picky about where he plays: Syracuse quarterback expected to go high
in NFL draft

BYLINE: Paul Domowitch

SECTION: Sports; D5

LENGTH: 549 words

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA


PHILADELPHIA -- Donovan McNabb doesn't know which NFL team is going to draft him
on April 17, and quite frankly, doesn't care.

He hasn't kissed up to the Cleveland Browns, as running back Ricky Williams and
quarterback Tim Couch have. He didn't bring a box of Godiva chocolates for coach
Andy Reid and director of football operations Tom Modrak on Thursday when he
visited the Philadelphia Eagles. He hasn't sent roses to the Bengals, Bears,
Ravens or any other team that has shown an interest in him.

''I'm not going to lobby for a position,'' McNabb said. ''You won't hear Donovan
McNabb saying I'd love to be an Eagle. I would, but I'm not going to sit there
in front of the media and say, 'If I don't get chosen, I'm going to be upset.'

''I just want to play football. I'm a competitor. I feed off of competition.
Whoever I'm playing for, wherever I'm at, I'm going to play to the best of my
ability. ''

With the draft just two weeks away, the Eagles are making their list and
checking it twice. They've got the second pick in the draft and can't afford to
screw it up.

Two of the other fab four quarterbacks -- Akili Smith and Daunte Culpepper --
interviewed with the Eagles on Monday. Couch visited yesterday. On Tuesday, Reid
and Modrak will fly out to San Diego to watch Williams work out.

Then, they will arrange their draft board, wait to see what the Browns do at No.
1 and make a decision. For now, McNabb is a definite possibility for the Eagles.
Both Modrak and Reid like him a lot.

''He might be the best athlete of the (quarterback) bunch,'' Reid said. ''He
also might have the strongest arm of the bunch.''

The one thing working against McNabb is that he's the only one of the top four
quarterbacks who didn't play in a pro-style offence. He threw 23 touchdown
passes in Syracuse's sprint-option offence last season. He seldom had to read
defences since he faced primarily man-to-man coverage.

McNabb ran for 438 yards and eight touchdowns as a senior. But he insists he's
more than an option quarterback. Much more.

''That's an unfair label,'' he said. ''I'm a quarterback first. Despite the fact
that I'm able to move around in the pocket, I can throw the ball as well.''

McNabb won a lot of coaches and scouts over with his impressive performance in
the Senior Bowl workouts, where he was tutored by Oakland Raiders coach and West
Coast offence expert Jon Gruden.

''Even though we ran the option offence, we threw the ball,'' McNabb said of his
time at Syracuse. ''Our passing offence was very prototypical. We did the same
thing that other teams do. We just also happened to run the option and picked up
a lot of yards with the running game. ''

McNabb said Syracuse's offence actually was more complicated for a quarterback
than the West Coast offence.

''The West Coast offence is an offence in which you're limited in the amount of
things you can do, as far as coming up to the line,'' he said. ''In the offence
I ran at Syracuse, you came up to the line with six or seven plays.

''(The West Coast offence) is pretty simple. Most of it is similar to (other
offences). The only thing you've got to learn is the terminology. If you study
the plays and understand where everyone is going to be at all times, it's not
difficult.''

BYU defense outshines offense

BYLINE: Jeff Call Deseret News

LENGTH: 579 words


PROVO ? BYU quarterback Max Hall's first pass of Friday's scrimmage was
intercepted by redshirt freshman defensive back Garrett Nicholson.  Then,
between Hall and backup QB Brenden Gaskins, the Cougar offense threw seven
consecutive incompletions. Later, Hall regrouped and led the offense on a drive
that culminated with a touchdown pass to tight end Dennis Pitta.

While the defense won the day overall on Friday ? after the offense scored four
times on four possessions on Thursday ? the general feeling was that it was a
good sign to see the defense make plays.  "It's absolutely a good sign," said
Hall, who completed 5-of-12 passes for 60 yards. "I think our offense is going
to be just as good or better than it was last year. To see our defense match us
and sometimes make plays on us is huge. It's a team effort. It's not about one
side or another. It's about playing as a team. I think we're going to do that
better than we did last year. When I see the 'D' make plays, sometimes I get mad
but inside I'm saying, 'That's what we need.' " Coach Bronco Mendenhall said he
wasn't concerned to see Hall struggle early on.  "It really isn't because the
defense actually did a really nice job and had a good day. It swings back and
forth. Anytime in spring practice one side or the other is dominant for longer
than a day or two, that's when I get concerned. I actually prefer it when swings
like that. It's good for the team, good for the chemistry and good for the
development of players on both sides." The scrimmage, which featured a number of
different situations, closed out the second week of spring practice.  "It was
really a positive scrimmage in terms of learning and two-minute situations and
handling clock management and overtime," Mendenhall said. "A lot of valuable
lessons learned."  One of the most impressive plays of the day was made by
Nicholson, who stepped in front of wide receiver O'Neill Chambers to pick off
Hall's pass. "Garrett Nicholson is going to be a good football player for us,"
Mendenhall said. "He's improving every day this spring." COACHES CLINIC: More
than 300 high school coaches descended on campus Friday for the annual coaching
clinic hosted by the BYU staff. The visiting coaches, who came from not only
Utah but also throughout the region, including Wyoming, Idaho, Colorado, Texas
and Hawaii, spent the day attending seminars and watching the Cougars' practice
and scrimmage.  "It's been a phenomenal day," Mendenhall said. "Great turnout."
INJURY UPDATE: Senior linebacker Matt Bauman underwent a knee scope Friday
morning to address an injury Bauman had suffered last year, Mendenhall said.
Bauman will be out 2-4 weeks.  Cornerback Brandon Bradley was held out of the
scrimmage due to an ankle injury. Bradley is expected to return to action the
middle of next week, according to Mendenhall.  NO FEEDBACK: Asked if he's
received any e-mails from BYU fans who may be upset about the cancellation of
the spring game, Mendenhall said he hasn't received one.  "I'm not sure if it's
in relation to the game or people just know now that I'll return their e-mail
and I'll be very blunt. I'm not sure if it's they're not interested or they're
afraid to e-mail. I like it how it is. I think we've done a great job of
explaining it. Our stadium is a special place and that's where I want to play
the spring game. So there really isn't much to say other than we'll use that
time to get ready for Oklahoma." E-MAIL: jeffc@desnews.com

Cowboys Owner Jones Stands by His Coach; Going Into Redskins Game, Gailey's
Offense Has Produced Two Touchdowns in Past Nine Quarters

Leonard Shapiro, Washington Post Staff Writer

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. D04

LENGTH: 846 words

DATELINE: IRVING, Tex., Oct. 22



Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones offered a strong vote of support for Chan
Gailey, his embattled second-year coach, and also had high praise for Washington
Redskins Coach Norv Turner two days before Sunday's game between the teams.

Gailey turned the Cowboys from a 6-10 team in '97 under Barry Switzer into a
10-6 NFC East division champion in his first season. He has come under heavy
fire in recent days from fans and local media members after losing two straight
games with an offense that has scored only two touchdowns in its last nine
quarters.

"Having our offense not perform well for two straight games, well if that makes
you jump, then we never would have won two Super Bowls," Jones said during an
interview Thursday evening. "We've always had dips, made adjustments and gotten
back on track.

"If we had a slump in the offense and I was going to find a doctor to help our
offense, it would be Chan Gailey. He's tireless in his effort, and he has the
imagination to perk it up. This [criticism] is not unexpected. When I hired him,
I expected there were times he would take heat."

The critics began to surface last year after the Cowboys' 20-7 loss to the
Arizona Cardinals in a first-round playoff game. It subsided somewhat after the
Cowboys rallied from a 21-point deficit to beat the Redskins in this season's
opener and started 3-0. But back-to-back losses to the Philadelphia Eagles and
New York Giants helped stir the pot again as Dallas faces the 4-1 Redskins.

"He hasn't won a Super Bowl yet," Jones said of Gailey. "And any time you have a
coach who has the responsibility he has, not only as head coach but in charge of
moving the football, he's going to hear it when the team is not moving the ball.
In my opinion, that's the hardest job and the toughest challenge there is. But
it all goes with the territory, and the magnitude of it goes with it also being
the Dallas Cowboys."

Turner was in that same hot seat when he controlled the Cowboys' offense from
1991 to 1993 as Jimmy Johnson's offensive coordinator. Dallas won Super Bowls in
Turner's last two seasons before he took the Washington job, and there was
speculation after Jones fired Barry Switzer following the '97 season that Turner
would have been his first choice to replace him.

Turner was still under contract to the Redskins and Jones said "we were not
allowed to make inquiries. John [Kent Cooke, then the team's owner] was not
interested in letting him get out of Washington."

Asked if Turner would have been his choice had he been free to move on, Jones
said, "I'm not going to get into that.

"I can tell you I'm very happy for Norv. He's had some success against us and it
seems like every time we turned around he was putting it on his old mentor,
Ernie Zampese. I have a lot of respect for what he is as a coach and his
imagination as an offensive strategist.

"But the thing I admire the most about him is how he grew up, what he's done as
an individual and how he's always handled himself. He's one of the finest people
I've met in professional football."

Jones also speaks highly of Gailey, who, like Turner, calls all the plays in the
Cowboys offense. After the first week of the season, when quarterback Troy
Aikman threw five touchdown passes at Redskins Stadium and the offense gained
541 yards, Dallas had the league's top-ranked offense.

The Cowboys have since slipped to No. 14, and Gailey said at the start of the
week perhaps he had been asking his offense to do too much and would simplify
this week to find "a happy medium." Having wide receiver Michael Irvin out for
at least eight weeks with a neck injury won't help.

This week running back Emmitt Smith, averaging a career-low 3.5 yards a carry,
said it was time to go back to basics and emphasize the team's strengths.

"There are times where you've just got to grab the bear by the throat and say
this is what we're going to do," Smith said. "We're going to stick to it for
right now until we get a handle on things. Then, once we get a handle on things,
maybe we expand. The game is still catch, block, tackle and run. It's us that
makes it confusing."

Aikman said the Cowboys' major problem right now is a lack of confidence. He
also insisted that he hasn't lost faith in Gailey's offensive scheme going into
what is being billed here as a crossroads game for the Cowboys, who would share
the NFC East lead with a victory.

"That's what this whole league is about, playing with confidence," Aikman said.
"That's what we have to get back. I don't know that anybody has the answer.
We've shown at times what we're capable of doing, but we certainly haven't done
it over the last two weeks.

"Offense is so much playing with confidence, playing with timing. The execution
part is so important. And if you lose any of that, it becomes very difficult to
have any kind of success. All I can say is, it's frustrating--very frustrating."

Jerry Jones has seen star wide receiver Michael Irvin leave the lineup with
spinal injury, and seen offense suffer as a result.

McCoy getting on-the-job training;
Browns' young QB grasps offense

BYLINE: Gary Graves, USA TODAY

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 8C

LENGTH: 794 words


Considering Colt McCoy was thrust into the Cleveland Browns starting quarterback
job as a rookie, his crash-course tutorial on the West Coast offense isn't that
shocking.

Unless, of course, you factor in that the second-year player was introduced to
the  formation just last week. The transition has included hiccups, and he and
others involved in the pass-oriented scheme promise there will be many more this
preseason. But McCoy's initial grasp of the offense might say there's more to
his skill set than his quick, accurate right arm, which  seems  tailor-made for
executing it.

"I think the biggest thing is that conceptually and mentally, I know what's
going on," he said. "I can see it in the (play)book, Coach (Pat Shurmur) can
install it, but the thing about playing quarterback in this offense is what you
do inside those concepts. Your footwook, looking off other guys, the spacing of
the receivers, those are the little things inside the major things you take hold
of and make your own in this system. That's  why practice is so crucial."

Last fall injuries to Jake Delhomme (since released) and Seneca Wallace allowed
McCoy to crack the lineup six weeks into his NFL career. Cleveland's top draft
pick out of the University of Texas eventually made the position his own by
starting eight of the final 11 games in 2010, including victories against the
defending champion New Orleans Saints and then 6-1 New England Patriots.

Despite throwing more interceptions (nine) than touchdowns (six) in a run-heavy
scheme, McCoy completed 69% of his passes three times and reclaimed the job from
Delhomme to start the final two games. Shurmur, hired in January after reviving
the St. Louis Rams offense behind rookie quarterback  Sam Bradford, immediately
handed the reins over to McCoy.

Just to be safe, the Browns retained Wallace, who has experience in the  West
Coast offense, and signed free agents Jarrett Brown (West Virginia) and Troy
Weatherhead (Hilldale). But if the reviews after last week's scrimmage at Browns
Stadium are any indication, McCoy is the man leading this transition.

"I think he's made great strides in one week," said Shurmur, who will also call
the plays. "He did some things (in one practice) that showed he's worked his way
through a couple of mistakes and corrected them. He's progressing."

As McCoy sorted his way through the new offense last week, his receivers have
dealt with injuries. Mohamed Massaquoi had a walking cast on his left foot, and
his return was uncertain; tight end Jordan Cameron has been out with a pulled
hamstring, while a hip flexor has sidelined wideout Jordan Norwood.

On the bright side, Joshua Cribbs (knee) and tight end Ben Watson (concussion)
recently returned from early camp injuries. Meanwhile, running back Peyton
Hillis -- coming off career highs of 1,177 rushing yards, 11 touchdowns and a
Pro Bowl selection -- eagerly prepares for whatever role awaits him in the
offense.

"I think it will be all that I can make it," said Hillis, who added 61
receptions for 477 yards and two scores.

"I can be very versatile, and the offense is set up to get guys open and get
them the ball. I love it (the offense), I love the coaches and the attitude they
bring, and I think that will show soon enough."

As for McCoy, becoming fluent with an offense he initially compared to a foreign
language is the result of constant video study including clips of Wallace (who
previously played with the Seattle Seahawks), whose advice has helped the
transition. Fast-paced as it appears on the field, things have actually slowed
to a managable tempo for him as he recognizes how to position himself and his
targets in the right place.

Just being in this position is more than McCoy could have foreseen a year ago,
when he arrived with the simple goal of proving he could progress to the next
level. Though fate accelerated the timetable of being the Browns quarterback of
the future, he feels fortunate that he was ready when his moment arrived sooner
rather than later.

"I'm definitely thankful for where we are and where I am individually," he said.
"When you get drafted, all you want is an opportunity, and mine came six games
into the season. I wasn't expecting that, but circumstances happen, and you got
to go play.

"I think life is about opportunities, and when you get them, it's what you do
with those and how you make the most of them."

Miami at New England: Patriots usually play Dolphins tough,
but this is Jimmy Johnson's best muscle-and-speed defense. . . . QB Dan Marino
still carries offense despite massive
search for running talent.  . . . QB Drew Bledsoe at top
of game, with career-high 8.37 yards an attempt and WR Terry Glenn
at Pro Bowl level.

* * * *

Minnesota at Detroit: Could be long day for QB Charlie
Batch, who was sacked nine times in the Vikings' sweep last year.
 . . . QB Randall Cunningham indecisive, and RB Robert
Smith hasn't played to last year's 1,187-yard season.


St. Louis at Atlanta: QB Kurt Warner and his speed receivers
offer ultimate test for suspect Falcons secondary.  . . . Falcons'
offense dreadful without RB Jamal Anderson and QB Chris Chandler,
and the defense will miss injured LBs Jessie Tuggle and Keith
Brooking.

Seattle at San Diego: Surprising Chargers win with swarming
front seven and upgraded secondary.  . . . QB Jon Kitna
a lot better than his portfolio, and Chargers must account for
6-4 WR Sean Dawkins.  . . . Seahawks defense still hasn't
played its "A" game.

Green Bay at Denver: It's QB Brian Griese's offense all
the way, with Bubby Brister idled by concealed rib injury, meaning
Packers will come out blitzing.  . . . Loss of TE Mark
Chmura leaves QB Brett Favre taking his chances and firing outside.
 . . . Broncos only a shadow of Super Bowl offense without
John Elway, Terrell Davis and Shannon Sharpe.

Indianapolis at New York Jets: Jets could be in for shake-up
after 1-4 start, which could include TE Eric Green, who hasn't
produced.  . . . Colts' offense has kept team in AFC East
race, with QB Peyton Manning and WR Marvin Harrison virtually
unstoppable.  . . . Jets' bend-don't-break defense can
only carry team so far without quarterback production.

Oakland at Buffalo: In-and-out Raiders will need track
cleats to keep up with QB Doug Flutie and muscle blocking to move
NT Ted Washington and linemates.  . . . Bills an underrated
team that plays sound football and scuffles for 60 minutes. . . . QB Rich Gannon
has done his part, but the Raiders have
lost three games by combined eight points.

Tennessee at New Orleans: Saints' quarterbacks are ailing;
third-stringer Danny Wuerffel could handle a struggling offense.
 . . . Titans can score, but injuries along rushline have
hurt the run defense.  . . . RB Ricky Williams, with injured
elbow, lacks burst to daylight.

Washington at Arizona: Redskins will pick on CB Corey Chavous
and stay away from Aeneas Williams.  . . . Series almost
always produces shootouts (364 points in last six games), and
QB Brad Johnson is up to it after off week.  . . . QB Jake
Plummer needs injured WR Rob Moore and a fresh start.

Philadelphia at Chicago: Bears' spray-it-around offense
has been better than expected, but rookie QB Cade McNown will
start.  . . . Eagles are coming off upset of Cowboys and
run a scattershot offense.

Pittsburgh at Cincinnati: Relentless Steelers defense can't
wait to see QB Akili Smith.  . . . QB Kordell Stewart could
have mismatch day against Bengals secondary.

Carolina at San Francisco: Scrambling QB Jeff Garcia gets
third start against George Seifert's clever defense.

Dallas at New York Giants: Cowboys will miss WR Michael
Irvin, but the defense can dominate with the Giants flip-flopping
quarterbacks to strong-armed Kent Graham.

NATION IN BRIEF;
Infamous rapist beaten by mob

BYLINE: From our news services

SECTION: NATIONAL NEWS; Pg. 12A

LENGTH: 833 words


A man known as Southern California's "pillowcase rapist" two decades ago was in
critical condition Thursday in Gary, Ind., the victim of a mob beating after
allegedly trying to rape another woman, a television station reported. Reginald
Muldrew, 47, was severely beaten by the woman's neighbors last week after trying
to break into her home, KCBS-TV in Los Angeles reported Thursday.

Muldrew, who moved to Gary after his release from prison in California, has been
hospitalized since Aug. 5, when he was so badly beaten that police used
fingerprints to identify him, according to KCBS- TV. He remained in critical
condition Thursday, Methodist Hospital nursing supervisor Leigh Sparks told The
Associated Press.

Muldrew, who put a pillowcase over his victims' heads to conceal his identity,
was linked to up to 200 sex crimes in the Los Angeles area from 1976 through
1978, sometimes several in one night.

CRIME Kevorkian at suicide

Dr. Jack Kevorkian and an associate took the body of a Massachusetts woman to a
hospital in Pontiac, Mich. late Thursday, a spokesman said. Kevorkian and Dr.
Georges Reding took the body to Pontiac Osteopathic Hospital at 11:07 p.m., said
Dr. Mitchell Garfield, an emergency room physician. Kevorkian identified the
woman as Judith Curren, 42, of Massachusetts. Kevorkian did not give the woman's
hometown, Garfield said. It was the 35th suicide Kevorkian has acknowledged
attending since 1990 and the sixth since his most recent acquittal on assisted
suicide charges.

Fake victim sentenced

A man who for six years pretended to be dying of cancer - even shaving his head
and faking seizures - got 14 months in prison Thursday for conning money and
sympathy from his family, church and employer. Charles Barry, 51, also was
ordered to repay nearly $ 43,000 to his victims and to perform 200 hours of
community service. The former car salesman claimed to have kidney, lung and
prostate cancer. His former wife and three stepsons believed him, as did most of
fellow residents of Canterbury, a town of 1,700 in central New Hampshire.

COURTS Divorce settled

Rep. Enid Greene and ex-husband Joe Waldholtz have reached a divorce settlement
that gives Greene sole custody of their 1-year-old daughter. The agreement also
covers property issues and averts a trial that was to begin Tuesday in Salt Lake
City. Waldholtz, who wanted joint custody of their daughter, is "not happy with
how things have turned out, but he's satisfied that he got a fair shake," said
Greg Skordas, Waldholtz's lawyer. The couple were divorced in June, but the
judge left open the question of custody of their daughter, Elizabeth, and the
division of their common property.

Simpson shuns cameras

O.J. Simpson moved Thursday to keep cameras out of his civil trial in Santa
Monica, Calif., asking for the case to be tried in the courtroom, "not on the 5
o'clock news." Nearly a year after Simpson's acquittal on murder charges was
televised around the world, his lawyer filed a motion objecting to the news
media's request for video and audio coverage of the wrongful death trial, set
for Sept. 17. "The judiciary and this community already experienced firsthand
the saturation of information disseminated outside of the courtroom during the
criminal trial created by media coverage," attorney Robert Baker wrote. Baker
objected not only to video cameras but also to audio coverage and still
photography, saying that because jurors probably will not be sequestered, such
coverage could prejudice Simpson's right to a fair trial.

Tinseltown cover-up?

Powerful Hollywood figures tried to cover up illegal drug use and improper
medical practices that contributed to the deaths of movie producer Don Simpson
and his physician friend, a wrongful death lawsuit alleges. Filed late
Wednesday, a day before the first anniversary of Dr. Stephen Ammerman's death,
the $ 50 million complaint alleges a far- reaching conspiracy that included
doctors, a nurse, a pharmacy, a celebrity private investigator and Simpson's
partner, Jerry Bruckheimer. Simpson and Bruckheimer created a string of hit
movies together in the 1980s, including "Top Gun" and "Flashdance." Last year,
they teamed up again to produce the summer hit "Crimson Tide." In one
provocative claim, the lawsuit filed by Ammerman's family alleges Ammerman did
not willingly take the massive dose of morphine that killed him Aug. 15, 1995.
Simpson died in January of this year.

Case between states

New York and New Jersey disagreed over more than 160 years of history Thursday
in a unique Supreme Court trial to determine which state is the home of most of
Ellis Island. At the end of the first trial ever in the high court's building,
New Jersey attorneys argued that an 1834 bistate agreement proves its claim to
all but the original 2.7 acres of the historic immigrant entry point. Paul
Verkuil, a special master appointed by the court, heard New Jersey's closing
arguments Thursday.

Possible links alleged in N.C. mail bombing

Searching the home of mail-bombing suspect Stephen Michael Bullis, investigators
found black vinyl tape, plastic and metal twist ties, according to an affidavit
filed Monday by the U.S. Postal Service. Bullis is accused of sending a package
bomb to his wife, Tracy Bullis, at her office at BTI in Raleigh on July 10.
Investigators found similar items in the debris in Mrs. Bullis' office.

Bullis, 30, made his first court appearance Monday. He maintains his innocence,
said his attorney. The affidavit also suggests a possible motive. It says Mrs.
Bullis had increased her group insurance benefits from $ 25,000 to $ 96,000 for
death due to natural causes and to $ 192,000 for accidental death or death
relating to employment. Bullis was named beneficiary. U.S. Attorney John Bennett
filed a motion to have Bullis held without bail. A hearing is scheduled for 2:30
p.m. Thursday.

FLORIDA

LIGHTNING STRIKES: Eleven people were injured, one critically, by three separate
lightning strikes in one Florida Panhandle county. Seven tourists were struck at
the beach in Destin and three other people were hit at the Air Force's Hurlburt

Gov. Lawton Chiles' state plane was struck by lightning as he flew from
Tallahassee to Tampa, but there were no injuries and only slight damage to the
aircraft.

SOUTH CAROLINA

CHAINLESS GANGS: Unlike Alabama and Arizona, which have reinstituted chain
gangs, South Carolina is using incentive, not iron, to put prisoners to work on
the roadsides. However, the inmates cleaning up the grassy shoulders in South
Carolina are not violent offenders. Alabama has revived the chain gang concept
for convicted murderers and rapists who are assigned to work along the state's
highways.

No huddle? No problem: Hurry-up offense gaining popularity

BYLINE: Ryan Wood, Journal-World, Lawrence, Kan.

SECTION: SPORTS

LENGTH: 605 words


Apr. 22--If Kansas University's offensive attack entertained you last football
season, just wait.

That no-huddle spread offense? Well ... it's spreading.

With teams like the Jayhawks having great success ditching the huddle and using
every square foot of the field in 2007, teams across the Big 12 Conference are
starting to try it as well. Already this spring, Oklahoma, Colorado, Kansas
State and Baylor have experimented with no-huddle to go along with teams that
already use it, like Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma State.

The no-huddle approach, where plays are signaled in from the sidelines, gives
the offense the opportunity to adjust to the defensive setup at the last second.
He who acts last gets the advantage.

"It's a chess game," KU coach Mark Mangino said, "that's played over a number of
years."

Interestingly enough, KU's style of attack benefits its entire team. Not only
did the Jayhawks rank eighth nationally in total offense and second in scoring
offense in 2007, but KU's defense faced it every day in practice and started to
adjust.

It will come in handy as more and more conference teams start implementing it.

"Just watching our defense, they're starting to pick up on some the little
nuances on offense that we do because they see it everyday," Mangino said. "That
means our offense is making our defense better."

Oklahoma coach Bob Stoops, whose Sooners play Kansas on Oct. 18, said he evolved
his offense toward no-huddle as a way to get more plays in over the course of a
game. Missouri, a no-huddle spread success story, was second in the Bowl
Subdivision with 1,112 offensive plays in 2007.

"The more other offenses are snapping it quicker, we want to make sure we are
getting the same number of tries at it," Stoops said. "With the opportunity to
change plays at the line of scrimmage, you need to be at the line quicker."

The question is, when will the defenses catch up? The Big 12 had five teams in
the top 10 nationally in total offense in 2007, and several games had outrageous
final scores -- most notably Kansas beating Nebraska, 76-39, Colorado beating
Nebraska, 65-51, and Texas beating Texas Tech, 59-43.

Most coaches asked about it Monday during the Big 12 coaches spring conference
call said it's all cyclical, and eventually the tables will turn. Oklahoma State
coach Mike Gundy wasn't so sure, citing more plays being run due to the
no-huddle approach and a greater tendency to pass the ball.

"Up until about three or four years ago, I think defenses were ahead with all
the zone-blitz packages they put in," Gundy said. "Now offenses have found a way
to overcome that.

"I think it's going to continue. I think people are going to score more points
than they ever have, and I don't think it's going the other way."

It's now the mission of defensive coordinators to prove Gundy wrong. Perhaps the
teams with the best chance to stop the spread offense, interestingly enough, are
the ones who know it and work with it on a daily basis.

Mangino wants to think so.

"How they're actually going to stop it? I think there's a lot of ways," Mangino
said. "I probably don't want to discuss those because we're going to play
against no-huddle spread offenses."

He sure is -- more than ever before.

PRO FOOTBALL: THE FINAL FOUR;
Rush Hour in the N.F.L.

BYLINE: By THOMAS GEORGE

SECTION: Section 8;  Page 1;  Column 2;  Sports Desk

LENGTH: 962 words


Kansas City, Buffalo, San Francisco and Dallas reached this afternoon's
conference championship games with quarterbacks immersed in playoff experience.
Each team has a star running back who grinds out critical yards and receivers
who make fingertip catches. Each has special teams that produce game-swinging
plays. Each has a defense that can arouse. Each knows plenty about exploiting
matchups.

Each team is of Super Bowl caliber.

And each team has developed an ingredient that has become a signature of the
1993-1994 National Football League season -- the pass rush.

This N.F.L. season began -- and it ends -- with several teams clamoring over
another new wave in pro football: The West Coast offense, or the 49ers offense
created by Bill Walsh, the former 49ers coach. It is an offense that features
quick drops and quick reads by the quarterback and quick throws and slant
patterns by receivers. It is an offense based primarily on timing. Timing by the
quarterback. Timing by the receivers.

Each Super Bowl finalist employs several elements of this offense. They will be
on display when the Chiefs and Bills tangle at 12:30 P.M. in Buffalo and when
the 49ers and Cowboys meet at 4 P.M. in Dallas.

Defenses have answered this offense with a throwback to those mid-1980's
defensive attacks of the Chicago Bears developed by Buddy Ryan, then the Bears'
defensive coordinator.

"Those old Bears seemed to come after the quarterback with all 11 guys on every
play," said Tony Dungy, Minnesota's defensive coordinator who coached the
Vikings to the league's No.1-ranked defense this season. "That's how they won
their Super Bowl. And then Joe Gibbs later in the 80's in Washington threw
maximum protection at you, two backs, two tight ends plus the Hogs, and defenses
started dropping back into coverage. Now with so many teams throwing the ball
again today with fewer blockers and with the quick, shorter passes, defenses
want to get in their faces again."

Greg Lloyd, the Pittsburgh Steelers' All-Pro linebacker, added: "I don't think
it's a coincidence that this is coming about with Buddy Ryan back in football.
Our team and Houston were at the forefront of going after the quarterback this
year. Defenses were better across the board than offenses this season. We got
tired of teams trying to nickel and dime us to death. If everything is based on
timing, then you want to break up that timing. Especially when they send out
more people than they keep in to block, no matter how quick they pass."

Blitzes From All Angles

The pass rush is coming from every angle.

Cornerbacks blitz. Safeties do, too. Linebackers blitz while defensive linemen
drop back into pass coverage. It has always been a part of pro football. Now it
is becoming a dominant part of the game and these playoffs.

Kansas City had nine sacks last week in its playoff victory over Houston. Two of
the sacks came from cornerback Albert Lewis and two more from safety Bennie
Thompson. Some of it was caused by leaky pass protection in the Oilers'
run-and-shoot offense.

More of it was due to the Chiefs' insistence on maintaining pressure. The Oilers
ran 66 plays. Coach Marty Schottenheimer of the Chiefs said his team blitzed on
45 plays.

"The pass rush is getting the recognition it deserves because it is winning ball
games," said defensive end Bruce Smith of the Bills. "You're talking about a lot
of big plays coming off the rush. Balls are being dropped, tipped, run back for
scores. Defenses do win championships, and one of the biggest parts of your
defense is the pass rush."

Al Smith, a Houston Oilers two-time All-Pro linebacker, observed firsthand this
season the defenses of all four remaining playoff teams. Houston won by 23-20
over Dallas in the preseason, defeated Kansas City, 30-0, in Week 2 of the
regular season, lost by 35-7 at Buffalo in Week 5 and won, 10-7, in San
Francisco in the next-to-last week of the regular season.

"Our defense and the way we came after people this year exposed some teams,
particularly their offensive blocking schemes," Smith said. "In the end, though,
Kansas City exposed us. Kansas City in our playoff game changed things up,
brought the cornerbacks on the blitz and came around the corners and made big
plays. They've got the best pass rush because they've got the most pass rushers.
They're quick. Buffalo comes at you hard and then they're the best at knocking
down balls at the line of scrimmage. San Francisco comes at you from the inside.
Dallas is good because they combine great effort with athletic ability and
speed."

Ranking the Pass Rushers

Lloyd ranks the best pass rushers in today's two games this way:

1. Bruce Smith of the Bills.

2. Neil Smith of the Chiefs.

3. Derrick Thomas of the Chiefs.

4. Cornelius Bennett of the Bills.

5. Dana Stubblefield of the 49ers.

6. Charles Haley of the Cowboys.

"Bruce, Neil, Derrick and Cornelius, I watch those guys to see what I can learn
from them," Lloyd said. "They are fun to watch. Bruce can just dominate guys.
Neil Smith, he's not very big in terms of weight but he has long arms and he
comes off the ball hard. He is emotional. I like that."

Dungy said he expects that in the Kansas City-Buffalo matchup in the American
Conference final, both teams will use several sets involving one running back
and three wide receivers, and that is when the pass rush for both teams will be
in high gear. In the Dallas-San Francisco National Conference final, Dungy said
to look for Dallas to bolster its pass rush with fresh players and with its
speed and for the 49ers to rely on nifty, creative schemes to mount its attack
on the quarterback.

"You have to pick your spots for the best rush and you have to guess right,"
Dungy said. "These teams have."

Sports of The Times;
Search for a Signature By the Giants' Offense

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN

SECTION: Section D; Page 8; Column 1; Sports Desk

LENGTH: 752 words

DATELINE: TAMPA, Fla.


FOR much of July and August, Giants fans heard Coach Jim Fassel talk about the
newfangled, high-powered, wide-open offense he was ready to unleash in his third
year on the job. This Giants offense would be versatile, volatile and
unpredictable.

During the preseason, the Giants offered tantalizing morsels of wide-open things
to come, and fans, hungry for a change, bit. If yesterday's season-opening
victory is any indication, the newfangled Giants offense everyone has been
talking about is actually its defense.

On a day when the Giants' offense and Tampa Bay's offense fought a duel of
ineptitude, the Giants' Jessie Armstead and Michael Strahan made it clear that
until further notice the team's foundation is what it has always been: defense.
The new offense mustered four first downs and 107 yards; the defense accounted
for 14 points and set up a field goal in the Giants' 17-13 victory over the
Buccaneers.

Kent Graham, who earned a starting quarterback berth on six strong games at the
end of last season, had a lukewarm season debut. Opening games are usually
dismissed as, well, opening games. But Graham's case is unusual.

When the Giants acquired Kerry Collins, the assumption was that the starting job
would be his by midseason. Maybe sooner. Fassel has steadfastly insisted that
the rugged Graham is the starter, no strings attached. Well, maybe one or two.

"A lot of people predicted Kent would not start the first game, that I'd make a
switch in the preseason," Fassel said. "That's not the case. All I've really
done for Kent is give him the opportunity. He's got to earn it.

"Kent's been around me long enough to know that I don't have a quick hook with a
quarterback, but you've got to win. You've got to play well. It's not a Supreme
Court appointment. You've got to function or you're going to be out."

The Giants won, but not because of Graham. For three quarters, the Giants'
offense with Graham at the helm struggled to find a rhythm. Completions were
sporadic, few points were scored and the running game was virtually nonexistent.

Graham was 12 of 23 for 91 yards passing. His longest completion was for 12
yards. While the Giants' new wide-open offense sputtered and jerked, the defense
repeatedly saved the day. In the first quarter, Christian Peter rumbled 38 yards
after recovering a fumble by the quarterback. Andre Weathers's interception
return gave the Giants a 14-10 lead.

Graham said the Giants played the way they had to play to beat Tampa Bay; I'll
buy that. The Bucs have one of the best defenses in the league, and outside of
bulldozing them, the only way to survive is to nickel-and-dime them.

"This was a good game of patience," Graham said. "We played smart; we didn't
turn the ball over. We knew going in that it was going to be tough to get it
done. But a lot of teams that play the Bucs get impatient and go deep and throw
interceptions. We didn't do that. We've go to do what it takes to win."

The best you can say for the Giants' offense is that Graham was better than
Tampa Bay's Trent Dilfer. This was not an encouraging spectacle for Giants fans
looking for the new infrastructure Fassel promised: 27 yards rushing, 91 in the
air.

The day was saved for the Giants because Dilfer was horrible: he had a fumble
returned for a touchdown; one of his interceptions was returned for a touchdown;
another interception set up a Giants field goal. Eric Zeier finally, mercifully,
replaced Dilfer, and he threw an interception that gave the Giants the game.

For two seasons, the quarterback position has been Fassel's Achilles' heel,
which is problematic for a coach who got the job on the strength of being a
quarterback guru. Fassel was hired to nurture two quarterbacks who are no longer
around: Dave Brown and Danny Kanell. Kanell replaced Brown, and Graham replaced
Kanell.

Still, four first downs is not the answer. Graham describes himself as the guy
who starts at the end of the line and finally works his way to the front. His
career has been a struggle. This year the starting job is his to lose.

If Fassel switches to Collins, Giants fans may legitimately begin to wonder
whether players are the problem or whether the scheme is the problem. What is
the scheme? The scheme is defense.

The job is Graham's to lose. He loses bits of it with every incomplete pass,
every interception, every sack when he holds the ball too long.

There is no cushion, no margin for error. Kerry Collins is the $16.9 million
clock that is ticking.

-> Tickets: Available at the gate. $6 for adults, $4 for students, free for kids
ages 5 and under

-> Records: This is the first game of the season for both teams. Kansas Wesleyan
finished 7-3 last season. SNU was 7-4 and finished second in the Central States
Football League.

-> Rankings: Southern Nazarene is No. 19 in the preseason NAIA poll. Kansas
Wesleyan is No. 21.

season. But it must replace graduated quarterback Doug Webster, who led the NAIA
in total offense. The Coyotes started fall camp with three QBs competing for the
No. 1 job. Still, coach Dave Dallas said Kansas Wesleyan has the potential to
put up similar numbers to last season, when 13 school records for offense were
broken.

Southern Nazarene has a stout offense of its own. Senior quarterback Brady
Wardlaw has already set several school records, including career marks for
passing yards (6,531), passing touchdowns (71) and total offense (7,130). Plus,
Wardlaw has a strong group of receivers that include Jarod Martin, David
Balenseifen, Jakeil Everhart and Kendahl Johnson.

FSU's Offense Moving The Ball

BYLINE: Tribune staff and wire

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 28

LENGTH: 358 words


TALLAHASSEE - It's been quite a while since Mickey Andrews has seen a Florida
State offense move the ball like this. In back-to-back games, against Colorado
and Miami, the Seminoles have rushed for a combined 540 yards and seven
touchdowns on 100 carries.

"It was great to see our offense run the football and do the things they did,"
Andrews said Monday. "I think it has given them confidence in themselves. I
think the defense has to learn how to be confident with the offense and the
offense with the defense."

In recent years there hasn't been much reason for FSU defenders to have much
confidence in their offensive teammates. But over the last two weeks, after the
seven-turnover debacle against Wake Forest, that might just be changing.

In the 39-21 win against Colorado in Jacksonville, sophomore QB Christian Ponder
led a game-clinching, 67-yard TD drive in the fourth quarter.

On Saturday at Dolphin Stadium - after untimely turnovers and poor special teams
play by the Seminoles had put the game in jeopardy - the FSU offense went out
and again drove the length of the field in the fourth quarter for a
back-breaking touchdown.

"I think it definitely helps that they can have a little more confidence in us,"
Ponder said of the defense. "We're not putting them out on the field all the
time like we have in the past."

Canes Lose Pair Of Defenders

CORAL GABLES - Starting weakside LB Colin McCarthy will miss the remainder of
the season because of a shoulder injury, Coach Randy Shannon said, and senior DE
Eric Moncur also could be out for the rest of the year after sustaining a leg
injury in the first half of Saturday's 41-39 loss to FSU.

Shannon said McCarthy likely will need surgery, but he will be reevaluated.
Coaches originally thought McCarthy, who injured the same shoulder in high
school, just had a "stinger."

OTHER BOWLS LOUISVILLE SLOWS BYU'S OFFENSE

BYLINE: From news services

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. D3

LENGTH: 662 words


The Louisville Cardinals thought they would have to use offense to beat Brigham
Young. The defense made that plan unnecessary.

Dave Ragone passed for 228 yards and three touchdowns, and the defense came up
with five sacks and three interceptions as No. 23 Louisville beat No. 19 Brigham
Young 28-10 Monday in the Liberty Bowl in Memphis, Tenn.

Ragone described the defensive play as unbelievable.

"They shut down one of the best offenses I've ever seen," he said of the
Cougars, who own the nation's top unit.

For BYU (12-2), the loss marked yet another disappointing end to a season that
held the promise of an undefeated campaign just a month ago.

The Cougars lost their third straight bowl game and the 10th in their past 14
despite an offense that averaged 542.8 yards per game and set a school record by
averaging 46.7 points. But All-America running back Luke Staley, the nation's
leading scorer, was out because of ankle surgery.

Louisville kept the Cougars from finding a rhythm.

The defense held BYU quarterback Brandon Doman to 18 of 37 for 192 yards. It
repeatedly gave the Louisville offense a short field, and three of the
Cardinals' TD drives were 54 yards or shorter.

"They were kind of pushing up and waiting for me to run around and do some
things," Doman said. "I wish I could go back and play that game again because we
had some other plays in mind, and we just simply had some miscues."

Defensive tackle Bobby Lefew and his teammates hoped they could keep the Cougars
to 25 points. They wound up limiting BYU to its lowest point total of the season
and a season-low 276 yards.

"We knew we had to hold them down, so our offense could outscore them, and
that's what we did," Lefew said.

PEACH

North Carolina 16, Auburn 10: North Carolina dominated on defense, while Ronald
Curry provided just enough offense to beat Auburn in Atlanta.

Curry scrambled for a 62-yard touchdown, and the Tar Heels kept Auburn out of
the end zone for nearly 59 minutes, holding on for a victory that capped a
successful first season for coach John Bunting.

North Carolina (8-5), playing in its first bowl since 1998, built a 16-0 lead
but got a scare at the end. After the Tar Heels botched a punt, backup
quarterback Daniel Cobb threw a 12-yard touchdown pass to Lorenzo Diamond with
1:18 remaining.

But Richard Moore recovered an onside kick to seal North Carolina's victory.

After beating Georgia on Nov. 10, Auburn (7-5) needed only one victory in its
last two regular-season games to play in the Southeastern Conference title game.

It never happened. The Tigers were blown out by Alabama (31-7) and LSU (27-14),
forcing them to settle for a belated trip to Atlanta. The consolation bowl did
little to soothe Auburn's wounds, sending them to the offseason with a
three-game losing streak in which they were outscored 74-31.

HUMANITARIAN

Clemson 49, Louisiana Tech 24: After Clemson's up-and-down season, dazzling
Woodrow Dantzler is happy with any bowl victory.

Even in the snow. Even in Boise.

Dantzler tied a school record with four touchdown passes, and Clemson coach
Tommy Bowden got his first postseason victory as the Tigers beat Louisiana Tech
in Boise, Idaho.

"This year was pretty rocky and didn't go the way we expected, but to come to a
bowl game and win is a great blessing," said Dantzler, who was voted Clemson's
most valuable player. "This is a great catapult for our team next year and a
great way for me to go out."

With snow falling from kickoff into the third quarter, Dantzler completed 15 of
23 passes for 218 yards. He ran 15 times for 57 yards before leaving with the
Tigers ahead 42-10 after the third quarter.

Both warm-weather teams struggled in the first half, but Clemson (7-5) took over
in the third quarter, turning up the intensity on both sides of the ball to
score 28 straight points on the Bulldogs (7-5).

Auburn was held to 176 yards, with only 31 of those coming on the ground.

Big Ten begins conference play with Wisconsin facing Nebraska in marquee game

BYLINE: By Joe Juliano; Inquirer Staff Writer

SECTION: SPORTS; Inq Sports; Pg. D03

LENGTH: 624 words



Finally, after what seemed like four interminable weeks of nonleague play
against the likes of Indiana State, Southeast Missouri, and three teams from the
Dakotas, the member football teams of the Big Ten Conference will start beating
up on each other Saturday.

Four teams will begin the first season of divisional play in the Big Ten with
unbeaten records. Wisconsin and Nebraska were expected to be unblemished through
four games, and both are ranked in the top 10 by the AP, also not a shocker.

There are two surprises. One is 19th-ranked Michigan, where quarterback Denard
Robinson is putting up crazy numbers again, and where the defense is achieving
some success rather than consistently running off the field after another
opponent touchdown.

But the other is a real surprise - Illinois, which recorded the conference's
only win over a ranked team, defeating then-No. 22 Arizona State.

Nebraska, which came from the Big Twelve to the Big Ten, will be making an
auspicious conference debut Saturday night at Wisconsin in the game of the week
in college football. The Cornhuskers lead the conference in rushing and are
averaging nearly 43 points.

For the first time, the teams will be playing for the right to represent their
divisions - the Leaders and the Legends - in the Big Ten championship game Dec.
3 in Indianapolis.

There really isn't a negative story that stands out for a Big Ten team except,
perhaps, for the anemic offenses of Penn State and Ohio State. The Buckeyes
haven't had any consistency at quarterback since the departure of Terrelle Pryor
for the NFL.

However, after playing Michigan State on Saturday, Ohio State will be getting
back two of its better offensive players, running back Dan Herron and wide
receiver DeVier Posey, both of whom were suspended for their role in a tattoo
parlor scandal that cost coach Jim Tressel his job.

The Nittany Lions, as has been well documented, can't decide on a No. 1
quarterback. They are last or next to last in the Big Ten in rush offense, total
offense, points, and pass efficiency. But they are among three conference teams
in the top 10 nationally in total defense and scoring defense.

Two quarterbacks have stood out thus far. Robinson has been incredible for
Michigan even though it wasn't expected he'd be running as much in new coach
Brady Hoke's more pro-style offense. Robinson leads the nation in rushing (168.7
yards per game) and is fifth in total offense (344.0).

At Wisconsin, Russell Wilson, who transferred from North Carolina State to use
up his final year of eligibility after graduating, has played almost exactly as
advertised. He is second nationally in pass efficiency and 17th in total offense
(311.0 yards).

The Badgers have rolled up some impressive numbers. Their offense averages 532.3
yards and 48.5 points, and their defense is in the top 10 nationally in rush,
pass, and total yards allowed and points yielded.

Northwestern senior quarterback Dan Persa, who has been slowly recovering from
last year's Achilles tendon rupture, is expected to make his first start of the
season Saturday at Illinois.

It has been a long - pardon the expression - preseason. The Big Ten played only
three games against ranked, nonconference opposition, with Penn State's loss to
Alabama and Minnesota getting beat at Southern California in addition to
Illinois-Arizona State.

Conference teams had a field day against teams from the Mid-American Conference
(10-1) and the FCS (9-1). Overall, the Big Ten is 34-12 against nonleague
opposition with two games remaining - Purdue hosting Notre Dame Saturday night
and Northwestern meeting Rice at home on Nov. 12.

But the real fun begins Saturday.

ON THE NFL;
Offense evolves as it expands;
There's more than one way to run the West Coast offense. Mike Holmgren remains
loyal to Bill Walsh's revered version, while others, such as Brad Childress,
like to fiddle with variations.

BYLINE: Mark Craig, Staff Writer

SECTION: SPORTS; ON THE NFL; Pg. 10C

LENGTH: 697 words


There's a photo of a thin-looking Mike Holmgren and his first coaching staff on
page 539 of the Green Bay Packers media guide.

Jon Gruden looks like he's 12. Steve Mariucci could pass for about 16. And Andy
Reid looks even slimmer than Holmgren. Throw in defensive assistants Dick Jauron
and Ray Rhodes, and there were five future NFL head coaches standing alongside
Holmgren in that 1992 photo.

The evolution continues Sunday when Holmgren, now the Seattle coach, faces a
second-generation disciple for the first time. Vikings coach Brad Childress, a
former Reid assistant in Philadelphia, will stand across from Holmgren in the
NFC's marquee game of the day.

The fact Childress is a second-generation Holmgren disciple makes him a
third-generation disciple of Bill Walsh, if not the creator of the popular West
Coast offense, then certainly its Obi-Wan Kenobi.

But that doesn't mean Childress and Holmgren run the same offense. In fact, when
Childress explains Holmgren's version of the West Coast offense, he sounds more
like a kid who had just visited a San Francisco 49ers museum.

"For people that know what they're looking at, Mike is the purest of the West
Coast guys," Childress said. "He's still running the split-back sweep, which,
football-wise, people don't believe you can bring a back on that side of the
formation over to this side of the formation and run it around the corner.

"He's still attacking nickels the same way. ... Not that they are not creative,
but he has not fiddled with it to the extent that maybe Mike Shanahan, Andy
Reid, Jon Gruden, those guys have."

Childress is a third-generation fiddler. "I know [Holmgren] has added stuff,
too, but as you always go back, you say, `Geez, there is 72 X Shallow Cross.
Holy cow,'-" he said. "They are running that base play out of the [original]
West Coast offense. It's not too simple for him. It still has merit to it."

West Coast disciples are spread throughout the NFL. Holmgren won a Super Bowl in
Green Bay and has coached in two others, including last season in Seattle.
Others - the fiddlers, if you will - also have had championship-caliber success.

Shanahan won two Super Bowls in Denver. Brian Billick, who coached under former
Walsh assistant Dennis Green with the Vikings, won one in Baltimore. Gruden won
one in Tampa. And Reid coached in one Super Bowl.

"I can be watching a West Coast offense on TV and if I hear an audible, I know
what the play is," Walsh said last month during a phone interview. "The
philosophy and terminology are essentially the same. But things evolve and
coaches add their own wrinkles. But I will say what Mike is doing in Seattle is
the closest to what we ran."

Walsh won three Super Bowls in 10 years with the 49ers. Holmgren was his
quarterbacks coach in the last one (Super Bowl XXIII). Perhaps that's why he has
remained a West Coast purist all these years while those who came behind him
couldn't resist tinkering.

Childress had the urge when he was working for Reid.

"[I'd say,] `How about if we do this and move this guy over here and we could
get this look?' " Childress would say to Reid. "One of his lines was, `You know
what? That's a good idea. You can do that when you have your offense.' Andy
always kind of chuckled about that."

Childress has had his own offense for only five games. Although it's too early
to get a good read on that offense, it should be noted that it has reached the
end zone only four times.

However, for what it's worth, Childress is 3-2 while Holmgren was 2-3 coming out
his bye week in 1992 with Green Bay. Having changed quarterbacks from Don
Majkowski  to a kid named Brett Favre only two weeks earlier, Holmgren stumbled
to a 2-5 start before finishing  9-7, second in the NFC Central and out of the
playoffs.

Childress can take a step toward topping Holmgren's debut season with a victory
Sunday. It's also another chance to further define himself as a third-generation
fiddler.

"I don't know that our style has been completely defined in five games,"
Childress said. "I think it is a body of work. Are you starting to form some
type of identity and personality? Probably. But again, it's a work in progress."

June 22--A Chippewa Falls man has been arrested for his 11th drunken driving
offense since 1994.

Osborne J. Burkins Jr., 47, 3951 90th St., is charged in Eau Claire County Court
with felony counts of 11th-offense drunken driving and bail jumping.

Judge Benjamin Proctor set a $10,000 cash bail for Burkins, who returns to court
Tuesday for a preliminary hearing. As conditions of bail Burkins cannot drink
alcohol or enter taverns.

According to the criminal complaint:

A state trooper pulled Burkins over at 10:50 p.m. Friday at Starr Avenue and
Eddy Lane.

Burkins' eyes were red and glassy and his speech was slow and slurred. The
trooper also could smell a strong odor of intoxicants on Burkins' breath.

Burkins said he had a couple of drinks.

Burkins failed field sobriety tests. A breath test showed he had a 0.177 percent
blood alcohol content, more than twice the legal limit for driving.

A sample of Burkins' blood was taken at Mayo Clinic Health System in Eau Claire,
formerly known as Luther Hospital.

Burkins was free on a $500 signature bond for an unrelated criminal case in
Chippewa County. As a condition of bond in that case, Burkins was prohibited
from committing new crimes.

In that case, Burkins is charged with felony counts of second-degree reckless
endangerment and second-degree reckless injury, and a misdemeanor count of
negligent operation of a motor vehicle.

According to the criminal complaint in that case:

Burkins was inside his vehicle at a Lake Hallie business April 25 while talking
to a woman who was outside his driver's side window.

Burkins suddenly sped away from the woman and she got caught in the window.

The woman fell in the parking lot and was treated at Sacred Heart Hospital for a
broken wrist, bruises and cuts.

Burkins turned himself in the following day. He told police the woman refused to
repay him $300. He said he fled when she reached for his steering wheel.

Burkins said he saw the woman fall but wasn't aware she was injured.

Burkins was previously convicted of drunken driving in December 1994, March
1995, April 2004 and December 2010 in Pennsylvania, in October 1995, December
1995, January 1997 and April 1997 in Utah, and in July 1998 and January 1999 in
Eau Claire County.

If convicted on both Eau Claire County charges, Burkins could be sentenced to up
to 10 1/2 years in prison.

- CINCINNATI: The Reds are satisfied with reliever Johnny Ruffin's explanation
of his arrest early Tuesday on misdemeanor traffic charges in Cincinnati. Ruffin
spent the night at the Hamilton County Justice Center, pleaded innocent at his
arraignment in Municipal Court, and was released after posting $ 50 bond.
Ruffin, 24, was a passenger in a car that was stopped at about 3 a.m. for a
traffic violation, police said. Ruffin was charged with failing to wear a seat
belt, and a computer check revealed he had failed to appear in court last year
on charges of speeding and not having a driver's license. Ruffin said he failed
to appear in court last year because he was sent to the minors that day. "I was
more worried about playing ball than the other thing I had to take care of," he
said. "It's minor, real minor."

-COLORADO: Pitchers Bill Swift and Marvin Freeman and catcher Jayhawk Owens all
made progress in recovering from injuries. Swift, on the disabled list with
tendinitis in his right bicep, threw 45 pain-free pitches in the bullpen. It was
the first time since spring training started he has not experienced pain
throwing off a mound. Freeman, who pulled his groin in the second game of the
season last Wednesday, pronounced himself ready to return to the rotation
against the New York Mets on Friday. Owens, meanwhile, said he doesn't believe
he'll require surgery on the torn ligament in his left thumb. He is on the
disabled list and hopes to return to the lineup by May 1.

HOUSTON: Center fielder Derek Bell made an over-the-head catch of Glenallen
Hill's drive in the sixth, saving two runs. Bell raced back and reached up and
made the catch as he got to the wall.

LOS ANGELES: The organization wants to help former center fielder Willie Davis,
arrested last month after threatening his parents. They won't do it with money,
however. Former Dodger pitching star Don Newcombe, the team's director of
community relations, said the club is concerned about Davis' well being. " We
got permission from (owner) Peter O'Malley to do everything we could to help
Willie Davis," Newcombe said.

NEW YORK: Todd Hundley has reached base in 12 of his last 20 plate appearances,
including five walks, four singles, a double and two homers.

Oakland has worst offense in NFL

BYLINE: By CAM INMAN MediaNews

SECTION: SPORTS

LENGTH: 613 words


Rarely is the football in Chris Morris' hands, and he's usually the Raiders
center. Such is life on the league's worst-ranked offense.

The Raiders (1-4) simply can't find the first-down marker to retain possession.
They have averaged only 10.8 first downs in their first five games, one of
several categories in which they rank 32nd. The Among the others: Yards per game
(191.6) and time of possession (25 minutes, 17 seconds).

"The offense has to do a better job of not going three (plays)-and-out. It's
been plaguing us the last four weeks," Morris said Monday at team headquarters
in Alameda, a day after the Raiders lost their third straight game, a 44-7 rout
by the host New York Giants.

First downs are a familiar problem for a team deluged by many others. The
Raiders finished last in the league in 2008 with 14.1 first downs per game. In
contrast, their 2002 team reached the Super Bowl behind a potent offense that
led the league with 22.9 first downs per game.

Coach Tom Cable didn't announce any lineup changes and said quarterback JaMarcus
Russell's disappointing play is "the least of my concerns." Blocking was the
chief complaint from Cable, who has no plans to relinquish his play-calling
role.

"I really look at it as, is the play you call, does that have anything to do
with executing it?" Cable said. "Does it have anything to do with being in a
manageable third down?

Added tight end Zach Miller: "We've got to protect the quarterback and stay out
of third-and-long situations. We just haven't been executing and running the
ball like we're supposed to, so that hurts our offense. Guys are not making
plays. We're missing blocks, missing assignments, missing receivers. It's coming
down to a lack of execution on offense."

· One new theory why Michael Vick isn't in a Raiders uniform   beside the
distinct possibility the Raiders weren't interested in the ex-con   is that NBC
analyst Tony Dungy recommended against it.

"I advised Michael Vick not to go there," Dungy said on Sunday's "Football Night
in America" broadcast. "I said, 'Mike, you might be able to start there but that
is not a good place for you.'"

Vick and the Philadelphia Eagles visit the Raiders on Sunday. In relief of
Donovan McNabb during Sunday's 33-14 win over Tampa Bay, Vick completed his
first pass since 2006, a 1-yard toss to DeSean Jackson. Vick ran four times for
10 yards and has completed 1 of 5 passes in two games since his reinstatement.

· Fox Sports' Jay Glazer reported that the Raiders contacted several teams last
week seeking to trade anyone except their "young, talented players."

Asked if the Raiders were exploring trades, Cable said: "Not right now. We
typically work on those sort of roster things in the next two days."

· Injuries could have a big impact on the linebacking corps. Kirk Morrison
sustained a sprained knee en route to his season-high 16 tackles Sunday. Ricky
Brown suffered an ankle injury that could result in season-ending surgery.

· Running back Darren McFadden and offensive tackle Cornell Green have been
ruled out of the game against the Eagles. Linebacker Brown (ankle) could be
facing season-ending surgery or simply be out four weeks, Cable said. Wide
receiver Chaz Schilens (foot) and guard Robert Gallery (leg) might return this
week.

· The Raiders have allowed the sixth most sacks in the league with 15, one less
than the 49ers' tally. "Our offensive line needs to step up and keep JaMarcus
(Russell) off his back so he can make those throws," Miller said.

· The Raiders are the only team in the league to have thrown only one touchdown
pass, that coming 93 passes ago by Russell in the season-opening loss to San
Diego.

Former pro football player Chip Banks was arrested Monday after his Chevy Blazer
collided with a car on Peachtree Road, killing a 50-year-old woman, Atlanta
police said.

Banks, 35, who played linebacker for the Cleveland Browns, San Diego Chargers
and Indianapolis Colts, was charged with second-degree vehicular homicide,
giving false information to officers, driving without a license and crossing the
median. He was in satisfactory condition at Grady Memorial Hospital, where he
was treated for facial injuries, according to police spokesman Sgt. Melvin
Denson.

Mattie Lee Chaney of Simpson Road was dead at the scene of the 3:15 p.m.
collision near Peachtree Battle Shopping Center, Denson said. She was driving
north in a Grand Prix when Banks's southbound Blazer crossed the median and
collided head-on, Denson said.

A chain reaction damaged two other cars behind Chaney's and injured four other
people, including a pregnant woman. Their conditions were not available Monday
night.

Banks gave police two addresses, one for his mother's home in Augusta and
another on Peachtree Road.

PRO FOOTBALL;
The Leading Theories for the Giants' Earthbound Offense

BYLINE: By MIKE FREEMAN

SECTION: Section 8;  Page 3;  Column 4;  Sports Desk

LENGTH: 949 words


When Giants quarterback Dave Brown has been asked if he would like to throw the
ball more, he usually thinks his answer through carefully. He doesn't want to
appear to be politicking for more passes or attention, something that would
certainly irk the sensitive Dan Reeves. So Brown answers with politically
correct responses, like, every quarterback would like to throw a lot but in this
particular offense, that isn't going to happen.

If Brown were injected with truth serum he would probably answer with what he
and many around him think: the offense is at times unnecessarily conservative.
And while Reeves and his supporters like to shrug off those accusations,
statistics show that since Brown became the starter in 1994, the Giants have
been one of the more conservative offenses in the league.

The Giants face the depleted and banged-up Dallas Cowboys today at Texas
Stadium. There is no question that the Giants have the best chance in years to
beat their division rivals, a team Reeves has not defeated in six games as coach
of the Giants. Dallas running back Emmitt Smith will play, but his neck and back
will be sore. But there will be no Michael Irvin. No Jay Novacek. Maybe no
return trip to the Super Bowl.

One thing about the Cowboys, though: They love adversity. So they will fight and
the Giants will still have to play a near-perfect game to win. And they may need
to open up their offense more or at the very least execute better to have a shot
at stopping the Cowboys.

"We just have to execute better," said Brown, when asked what goes wrong with
the Giants' offense once it gets inside an opponent's 20-yard line. Against
Buffalo in the red zone last week, Brown explained: "We missed a block one time.
We missed some throws. We had some good plays called at the time; we just didn't
go out and execute them."

The Giants' offense has clearly been a conservative one the last two years.
Including last week's games against Buffalo, the Giants have thrown just 911
passes over the last two seasons, averaging 27.6 a game. Only the Indianapolis
Colts have thrown fewer passes over the same time period, 843 or 25.5 a game.
But that number is slightly deceiving since the Colts have had a staggering five
different quarterbacks start in the last two seasons -- Jim Harbaugh, Craig
Erickson, Paul Justin, Don Majkowski and Browning Nagle -- before settling on
Harbaugh. Adding to the lower figure was the Colts' reliance on the running game
and the Pro Bowl back Marshall Faulk.

So the Giants have essentially had the most conservative offense in the league
since Brown became a starter. The bottom five teams in pass attempts the last
two season are the Colts (843), Giants (911), Dallas (979), Tampa Bay (1,028)
and Seattle (1,050). The Cowboys' attempts are so low because in games over the
last two years they have usually been ahead and could give the ball to Smith to
run down the clock.

The question is why have the Giants been so conservative. This has come up again
because some thought the team went slightly conservative in the second half of
the 23-20 overtime loss to the Bills last week. Reeves explained his approach by
saying that the Bills' defense was destroying the Giants' offensive line in the
second half. Also, for the Giants to be successful this season, he said, they
must run the ball.

"You've got to have something to sink your teeth in," Reeves said.

A problem for Brown, however, is that in throwing so few passes, he may never
have a chance to truly hone his skills. And because the offense is at times so
restrictive, there will be few chances for Brown to win a game on his own.

There are a number of theories why the offense has been so conservative. They
include:

*The young team theory. Because the offensive line, in particular, is so young,
it is better to be conservative. That may be true, but last season, with
veterans like Jumbo Elliott and Lance Smith starting, the team still rarely
threw the ball.

*The who-gets-the-credit theory. Quarterback John Elway, it is widely believed
and has been reported by Denver news media, thinks his volatile dispute with
Reeves began with Elway's getting credit for many of the team's thrilling
comebacks when both were in Denver. Reeves also used to get angry when Elway
told the news media he called certain plays instead of Reeves. The Oliver Stones
of the world -- and some of them are in the Giants organization -- believe
Reeves will never let Brown open it up because he does not want Brown to get
credit for winning a game. In fact, Reeves once became petulant at the end of a
news conference during which the news media had given credit to the offensive
coordinator George Henshaw for calling some successful plays.

*The nonconspiracy theory. Reeves simply wants to have a well-balanced offense,
or at the very least rely on the running game. Under Reeves in 1993, Phil Simms
threw 400 passes -- about 55 fewer than Brown's two-year average -- even though
Simms that year threw for 3,038 yards, 363 more yards than Brown's two-year
average.

*The confidence theory. It is a nasty circle. Reeves has little confidence in
Brown and the offense, so the few times he opens it up and things go wrong --
say, when a perfectly thrown deep ball to receiver Thomas Lewis was dropped in
the second half against Buffalo -- those mistakes reinforce Reeves's
conservative nature. But in order for the offense to effectively make those
plays, the plays need to be run more. So it just goes around and around.

*The Hampton theory. If you have a horse, you ride it. Rodney Hampton is maybe
the best back the team has ever had. Reeves likes to give him the ball and let
him go.

WEST VIRGINIA FOOTBALL;
Howard gives Holgorsen options on offense

BYLINE: Mike Casazza, Staff writer

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. P1B

LENGTH: 1061 words


MORGANTOWN - For the second straight year and the fourth time in now five
seasons as West Virginia's head coach, Dana Holgosen opens up a football season
today with no uncertainty about who is his best quarterback. Skyler Howard
follows the path first traveled by Geno Smith in 2011-12 and Clint Trickett last
season, but this is not to say the situation is without questions.

The Mountaineers know who will lead their offense. What's unknown is what it
will look like with Howard.

He is the most mobile quarterback Holgorsen has had at WVU and the best option
among them to handle called running plays. Holgorsen will make use of Howard's
skill to further diversify an offense that's evolved through his WVU years, but
it's not yet clear to what extent the junior's skills will change the way the
team gains yards and scores points.

"Dana's a smart guy, said Oklahoma State coach Mike Gundy, who hired Holgorsen
to be the offensive coordinator and install his offense in 2010. "He's going to
come up with a plan as good as anybody for what he's working with. That's my
opinion from my time spent with Dana. That's a strength of his. I would
seriously doubt they have anything less than what the quarterback can do.

Howard started the final two games last season and played in two others and put
his legs to good use for the offense. He was sacked four times in 110 pass
attempts. Trickett was sacked 26 times in 419 pass attempts - about twice as
frequently as Howard.

While Holgorsen didn't want Trickett prolonging plays by escaping the pocket and
thus inviting hits, Howard was encouraged and able to keep the action going and
either run if he had space or throw if he had an open receiver.

"I watched him play in the bowl game and I watched him against Iowa State and he
definitely keeps things alive and extends plays with his feet, said Texas Tech
coach Kliff Kingsbury, Holgorsen's pupil as quarterback for the Red Raiders and
an assistant at Houston.

"That's something you can do in the offense if you have a kid who can do it, but
it takes a little bit of time for the offensive line and the receivers to get
used to. It can be a huge factor for your offense, though. Look at the success
Trevone Boykin had last year extending plays. It looks like [Howard] has a lot
of that type of ability.

Howard also scrambled or carried 18 times for 172 yards. Much of his yardage
came on read plays when he kept the ball instead of handing it off to a running
back, though the play also allowed him to hand off if a defender was in position
to stop Howard. That was one concept the offense grew to feature with Howard
that it couldn't use as often or as effectively with Trickett.

It's not the only way Howard can further impact the offense, which is worth
remembering now after he and Holgorsen banked a full circuit of winter, spring
and summer opportunities to put together a plan they will first unveil in the
season-opener Sept. 5 against Georgia Southern.

"It's becoming more multiple, Holgorsen said.

Holgorsen's 2010 Oklahoma State offense featured 6-foot-6 quarterback Brandon
Weeden, and he and backup Clint Chelf only ran the ball seven times. In 2011,
they actually ran two fewer times. In 2012, Chelf, J.W. Walsh and Wes Lunt had
72 carries. A year later, Chelf and Walsh pushed the number to 107.

Oklahoma State ranked No. 3 nationally in total offense in 2010 and 2011, No. 4
in 2012 and No. 37 in 2013. Gundy again needed to use three quarterbacks last
season, a chore that nevertheless produced 6-4 Mason Rudolph at the end of his
true freshman season. He begins as the starter this year, but Gundy vows to
incorporate Walsh and his legs because the senior can "be a factor in the
success of our football team this season.

"What you can do with this style of quarterback in this style of offense is
considerably different, Gundy said. "We're not the same team from an attacking
point with J.W. as we are with Mason, even though the plays are the same. The
year we had Chelf and J.W. and all that quarterback run game, we were running
all the same plays. We stayed the same.

"What we did with J.W. last year and before when he and Clint were playing
compared to what we did with Weeden and what we're doing with Rudolph now is
considerably different.

Yet it remains within the scope of the offense. The Cowboys ranked Nos. 36, 58,
21 and 63 in rushing offense from 2010-13 and Nos. 2, 2, 7 and 29 in pass
offense. They won 11, 12, 8 and 10 games, never finished lower than third in the
Big 12 standings, went 3-1 in bowl games and finished ranked in the top 17 three
times and the top three once.

"I think the best way to put it is that Dana's going to have maybe a little
different style of offense based on what his quarterback can do, but he's still
going to run all of about six play, Gundy said. "That's his philosophy, the Mike
Leach philosophy he grew up in. I saw that when he was with us.

Holgorsen has changed, slightly though noticeably, through the years.

"I'm finding new ways of doing multiple things, he said.

That includes changing the tempo the offense uses, filling positions with
players of different sizes and skills and further modifying the packages,
formations and motion that accompany his core plays. The greatest difference as
he begins this season is "having the confidence to call it and having people who
can do it.

The trend toward a multiple offense has been gradual and unmistakable. His
offenses passed the ball 56 percent of the time in 2011, 54 percent of the time
in 2012 and 52 percent of the time in 2013. Last season, the offense ran the
ball 52 percent of the time, a product of depth in the backfield and Howard's
versatile role under center.

But in the final two-plus games in which Howard took all the snaps, there were
108 passes and 85 runs. Howard passed for 829 yards and didn't throw an
interception, but he also completed just 52 percent of his throws.

"Dana will try to play to his strengths, Kingsbury said. "If there's some
quarterback run game, it's because he trusts him to do that. If he's better at
getting out of the pocket, he'll let him do that. A lot of those guys, you call
the plays and if they're not there they have an ability to get out on their own
and make a big play.

"But I don't think he'll completely shift things. I think he'll let that young
man use his talents when things aren't there to make a play."

Bills QB battle continues in Carolina;
Holcomb, Losman will share snaps

BYLINE: By Allen Wilson - NEWS SPORTS REPORTER

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. B1

LENGTH: 1022 words

DATELINE: CHARLOTTE, N.C.


The Buffalo Bills have no timetable when they will name a starting quarterback.
But their preseason opener against the Carolina Panthers tonight in Bank of
America Stadium will help bring some clarity to the competition.

Kelly Holcomb will start and play the first quarter and part of the second
before giving way to J.P. Losman. Craig Nall is still nursing a pulled hamstring
and won't play.

The quarterbacks have been battling for the top spot since the offseason. No one
will win the starting job based on one game, but tonight's contest will be
viewed as their first true test.

"Obviously, we've pointed all the time toward full-contact scrimmage and this is
it," said coach Dick Jauron, who will make his Bills sideline debut tonight.
"This is almost the only chance you get to do it with a quarterback. So here we
go."

Jauron downplayed the decision to go with Holcomb, and with good reason. Holcomb
is listed as first on the depth chart and has usually been the first quarterback
to work with the starting offense. The quarterbacks have gotten equal
repetitions throughout training camp, however.

Holcomb gets the nod tonight, but Losman is expected to start next Friday's game
against the Cincinnati Bengals at Ralph Wilson Stadium.

"There's no need to read anything else into it, really," Jauron said of his
decision to start Holcomb. "I think they'll both get a good deal of playing
time. We'll just see how the game goes."

Holcomb will get most of the snaps with the starting offense, but Losman will
get some reps with the first unit as well. The roles will be reversed next week
most likely.

Jauron informed Holcomb and Losman of his decision in the locker room after the
Thursday night practice. Even before they knew, the quarterbacks weren't
concerned about who played first tonight.

"It really doesn't matter," Losman said. "It's the first preseason game. It's
not really do or die or that's the answer. It's a preseason game and whoever the
guy is still has a couple of games to show what he's got."

The offense hasn't been overly impressive in training camp, which may be a
byproduct of learning a new system. But Losman has looked better than Holcomb.

Losman's decision-making is still a little inconsistent, but he has displayed
the strongest arm in camp and has made more accurate throws when he's on the
move. Holcomb's lack of arm strength gets him in trouble at times, particularly
on deep throws over the middle or along the sideline. Defenders have been able
to make plays on the ball before it gets to the intended receiver.

Holcomb has had plenty of good moments, though he readily admits the rough times
he's experienced in the first two weeks is a direct result of trying to feel his
way through coordinator Steve Fairchild's offense.

"This [offense] has been the biggest adjustment for me since I've been in
virtually the same kind of offense for nine years," Holcomb said. "There are
some different things in this offense and I'm getting more comfortable with it
every day -- pushing the ball downfield and stuff. We've made some improvements.
We're all looking forward to getting on the field in Carolina and see if we can
take what we do on the practice field into the game."

Despite the offense's struggles, Losman said it is too early for anyone to
panic.

"Those things are just going to happen, especially the first year you put an
offense in, and especially in the first few weeks," he said. "That's what the
preseason is for. We get four weeks to critique it, perfect it and try to master
everything we have to master."

While the quarterbacks are commanding most of the attention, there are some
other positions that will be under the microscope tonight.

The running back competition has been very intense as Anthony Thomas and Lionel
Gates have emerged as the top candidates to become Willis McGahee's main backup.
Gates is having a strong camp for the second straight year and is sharing snaps
with Thomas on the second unit.

McGahee's playing time will be limited tonight, so Thomas, Gates and Shaud
Williams will get most of the carries in the running game. Members of a crowded
group of wide receivers will get a chance to distinguish themselves tonight as
well. We'll also get to see tight end Kevin Everett in a game for the first
time. The second-year player missed last season with a knee injury and is
competing with Brad Cieslak and Ryan Neufeld for the backup spot behind new
starter Robert Royal.

This will be the first game for the Bills' revamped offensive line. Tackles Mike
Gandy and Jason Peters, guards Tutan Reyes and Chris Villarrial and center
Melvin Fowler have taken every snap together in camp.

The Panthers have one of the best defensive lines in the NFL, so how the Bills
front five fares will be an indicator of the unit's progress.

"Carolina's D-line is big, strong and athletic," said Reyes, a former Panther.
"It will be a good test for us."

On the defensive side, first-year coordinator Perry Fewell will unveil a new
scheme.

"We're making progress every day," Fewell said recently. "Rome wasn't built in a
day, so it's going to take some time for the defense get to where we want it to
be."

Safety and first-round draft pick Donte Whitner will make his debut tonight.
Whitner ended his holdout by signing a five-year contract last Saturday.

Although he has a full week of practice under his belt, the Bills aren't certain
how much he'll play on defense.

"We want to make sure that we feel comfortable that he's ready to play in a
game, and then we'll make a decision," Jauron said. "We'll test him, and he may
see some playing time. He certainly will see a little time, if nothing else, on
special teams."

The defense could be short a couple of players tonight. Safety Coy Wire and
defensive tackle Lauvale Sape may not play because of pulled back muscles.
Jauron said that will be a game-time decision.

As expected, linebacker Takeo Spikes will not be in uniform. He said he could
play if necessary, but Jauron said there is no rush.

"It'll be a nice break for him here," Jauron said. "He'll continue his
conditioning and rehab, but we'll stick with our plan."

Defense can help Celtics offense

BYLINE: Jeff Zillgitt, @JeffZillgitt, USA TODAY Sports

SECTION: SPORTS; Pg. 4C

LENGTH: 387 words


The Boston Celtics will have to fix their offensive woes if they're to get back
in this series with the New York Knicks. And it starts with defense.

"If we don't get stops," Celtics coach Doc Rivers said, "then we can't play,
because we don't have ability to walk the ball up the floor under pressure and
run our offense."

Boston is a much better team pushing the ball in transition before the
opposition sets up its defense, and that style of play has been missing since
point guard Rajon Rondo's season-ending knee injury Jan. 25. That left the
Celtics without a player who had complete command of the halfcourt offense.

Rondo is the rare point guard who can dominate a game without scoring. He knows
how to run the offense, how to keep the defense guessing and where to get Paul
Pierce and Kevin Garnett the ball. That's missing right now, and it's obvious as
the Knicks have stymied Boston's offense and taken a 2-0 series lead. Game 3 is
today (8 p.m. ET, ESPN).

Rivers long ago this season stopped lamenting Rondo's absence.

"It's who we are, so I don't worry about it," Rivers said. "Listen, we are who
we are. We can't apologize for that. That's what we've been left with. I think
it's good enough to win."

Without Rondo,  Avery Bradley handles the ball the majority of the time. But as
Rivers points out, Bradley is a strong defender and improving scorer, but he is
not a point guard.

"The game is not as difficult as we make it at times," Rivers said. "We were
walking the ball up the floor under an amazing amount of pressure. That's where
the Knicks clearly turned up their pressure."

The Knicks know  the best way to stop Boston's offense is to score, and they are
partly responsible for the Celtics' shortcomings. New York has  scored and
increased the defensive intensity when necessary, pressuring Boston's guards and
preventing  easy entry passes to Garnett and Pierce.

"When Rondo's out there, they're in a certain flow. When he's not out there,
they don't know who to go to in certain situations (and) they don't know what
plays they're running," Knicks guard J.R. Smith said. "That's a credit  to a
great point guard like Rondo. Whenever he's in the game, it seems like he knows
two, three plays ahead of time what he wants to do. ...

"We're doing a great job to make sure they don't have time to think about it."

Rams offense is always in the zone

SECTION: SPORTS, Pg. 27

LENGTH: 727 words


Best offense ever.

Wow. That covers a lot of NFL territory. In fact, it covers all NFL territory.

But those are the words being used by some members of the national media to
describe the St. Louis Rams' offensive juggernaut this season.

Fox TV analyst and former Oakland Raiders coach John Madden recently told Sports
Illustrated, "I think it's the best offense in the history of football."

ESPN's Tom Jackson said, "Kurt Warner and the Rams may be the best story in the
history of the league."

Even the opposition is impressed.

"The Rams' offense is awesome," says Atlanta Falcons defensive tackle Travis
Hall.

"They are so powerful on offense that if you stop one thing, they get you with
another," says Falcons cornerback Ray Buchanan.

There's little wonder why people are getting so caught up in the Rams' ability
to produce points and yardage. Before Sunday's rematch with the Falcons at the
Trans World Dome, the Rams led the league in total offense, averaging 505.4
yards a game; in points scored (217), and in average points per game (43.4).

Then they went out and totaled 529 yards while beating the Falcons 45-29.

The Rams have scored 30 or more points in an NFL-record 12 consecutive
regular-season games. That's five more games than the previous record, shared by
the 1956 Chicago Bears, 1963 Green Bay Packers and 1968 Cleveland Browns.

Quarterback Kurt Warner and running back Marshall Faulk are on pace to break
just about every single-season offensive record imaginable. And a few records
nobody ever imagined would be broken.

So after years of being one of the NFL's forgotten teams - and deservedly so -
the Rams are dazzling almost everyone with their explosive firepower.

Almost everyone. There remains one group that still isn't all that impressed.
One group that is not convinced this Rams' offense is the best of all time.

It's the Rams' offense.

"That's what they think," says Faulk. " I'll let you think that; I'll let you
say that. But for me, I don't know.

" I didn't get to see some of the early offenses before ours," says Faulk, who
has 1,083 yards of total offense this season and is on pace for 2,888, which
would shatter his own NFL mark of 2,429 set last season. "I've only been
watching football since I was maybe 6 or 7.

"But I know one thing - when we go out there, we feel like we can score when we
want to score and we can do what we want to do. If anything's going to happen
with us, we'll stop ourselves by not executing."

Which has seldom been a problem for the Rams this season. But even Warner, who
is on pace to pass for an NFL-record 6,032 yards (the current mark is 5,084 by
Dan Marino in 1984) hasn't bought into the "best ever" tag just yet.

"My feeling is that that's their opinion," Warner says. "I don't know. I don't
think about it. I mean, if we're done playing, and they look back and say, 'Hey,
this team was the greatest offense, ' then great. But if they don't, then who
cares?

"It's all an opinion. Different eras, different times. How do you even decipher
all that?" wonders Warner, who Sunday tied the NFL record of six consecutive
300-yard games. "If we can win another Super Bowl, win a few more Super Bowls
down the road, then maybe you can say we're the best offense, the best team in
the league.

" That's what we're shooting for."

Wide receiver Isaac Bruce is on pace for 1, 845 receiving yards this season. The
NFL record is 1,848 by Jerry Rice in 1995. But Bruce is another St. Louis player
who doesn't care about labeling the Rams' record offense as the best ever. He
just wants it to keep going and going and going.

"Let's hope that it doesn't stop," says Bruce. "We are just out there trying to
execute to the best of our ability.

"We know that we are going to play the whole game, regardless," says Bruce.
"Coach (Mike) Martz is not going to take out the first-team players, so we know
that our job is to just go out there and continue to put points on the board."

Which they've done at a record-setting pace. But how long can that continue?

" Hopefully, we can keep it up for as long as we need to," says Warner. "As long
as our offense has to score 40 points, I think our offense will be up to the
task.

"I have the ultimate belief that we can do just that."

As far as everyone else is concerned, they're already believers.

The sister of Green Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre was released on bond
from a Slidell, La., jail, accused of taking part in a drive-by shooting at a
motel. The arrest of Southern Mississippi student Brandi Favre, 19, comes nearly
three months after her brother, the NFL's most valuable player last season,
completed treatment for addiction to painkillers. Last month, their older
brother, Scott Favre, was arrested on a felony DUI charge after an accident that
killed a friend.

Gulfport, Miss., to three years in prison for violating his probation on drug
charges. Bullard was arrested in August in connection with a July fight on
Mississippi State's Starkville campus. The 21-year- old was accused of
pistol-whipping another student. He violated the terms of his probation by
possessing a weapon and failing to report to his probation officer. Bullard was
charged with possession of cocaine with intent to distribute in 1993. . . . Ryan
Tucker, the Texas Christian basketball center indicted with three teammates in
the beating of another student, previously was in trouble with the law. The
Dallas Morning News reported that based on Fort Worth municipal court records
and eyewitness accounts, Tucker was accused in at least two other assaults and
has received a public-intoxication charge over the past two years. The alleged
victim still suffers from a swollen brain, skull fracture and facial paralysis
from the attack. He has since left school. The felony charges of aggravated
assault carry maximum penalties of 20 years in prison and $ 10,000 in fines.

Browns emphasizing 'up-tempo offense'; Weeden wants 'to be the guy'

BYLINE: Cary Ashby, Norwalk Reflector, Ohio

SECTION: SPORTS

LENGTH: 643 words


May 17--BEREA -- The Cleveland Browns coaching staff has been emphasizing speed
and creating an "up-tempo offense" during organized team activities (OTA).

"We've really had a good week," coach Rob Chudzinski said after Thursday's OTA.
"We've gotten a lot done this week.

"I've been pleased with the tempo," he added. "I feel good with this group and
what they're doing and how they're progressing."

The offense worked with a 40-second play clock between plays on 11 vs. 11
drills.

Quarterbacks Brandon Weeden and Jason Campbell alternated sets of downs and
often played out of the shotgun formation.

Third-year QB Thaddeus Lewis ran plays for about the last 15 minutes of
Thursday's OTA while the coaches spoke to the rest of the team.

"Brandon has been working with the first group. Jason has been working with the
second group," said Chudzinski, who has been trying to get the offense to the
line faster as the week progressed.

"(We) want to put stress on the quarterback," he said. "The tempo is pretty
good. ... We've worked them at a pretty good clip."

Campbell, in a separate interview, said the emphasis in camp has been on lining
up faster and creating an "uptempo offense."

Weeden also said the coaching staff has "harped" on speed and tempo.

"It pressures defenses," he said.

In addition to a faster tempo, Chudzinski said the offense has been working on
third-down plays.

"We're in the process of installing those situations," the coach said.

Campbell, formerly a starter with the Washington Redskins and Oakland Raiders,
was asked if his experience with other teams, coaches and training camps has
been helpful in making the transition into the Browns' system.

"It has helped me a lot. ... I've learned a lot offenses," said Campbell. "You
might call it my cup of tea."

The nine-year veteran came to the Browns as a free agent after one season with
the Chicago Bears.

"A lot of it (the differences) is the language," Campbell said.

"Some times I call a play from my other life," he said with a chuckle. "It's the
same play -- just called something different."

Campbell said he and Weeden have a good relationship.

"We push each other. ... Right now, it's all about getting better as a team,"
Campbell said.

"Everybody feels comfortable," he said. "We definitely have some young players
who can play."

When asked about Campbell, Chudzinski complimented him on his previous NFL
success and having a "good arm" and "good mobility."

"He's got a good touch and puts the ball where he wants it," the coach said.

Weeden called Campbell a "great guy" who has been a great "resource" with a lot
of NFL experience.

"He's playing well. He's throwing the ball good," said Weeden, who swatted
Campbell on the butt and shook hands with him Thursday.

"I'm asking him questions. ... He's pushing me," Weeden said.

Weeden is grateful for offensive coordinator Norv Turner coaching him between
plays about having a faster release, his speed and picking up his feet.

Turner, when he saw one of his quarterbacks throw a good pass, yelled, "There it
is."

"Throw it over the linebacker, not into the linebacker," Turner said after
another play.

"He coached me on every play. That's the way it should be," Weeden said. "I'm
like a sponge."

Reporters asked Weeden if he's approaching training camp as if he were the
starter.

"I'm approaching it that I'm going to be the guy. ... I want to be the guy. I
want to build off last year," said Weeden, who hopes his teammates consider him
the starting quarterback.

"My concern is working hard and getting better. ... If I worried about the other
stuff, I couldn't function," he said.

Chudzinski declined to say which quarterback would be his starter.

"It wouldn't be smart to name a starter," he said.
