AIDS is controllable, WHO reports

SECTION: PERSPECTIVE; Background; Pg. 3D

LENGTH: 2239 words



Following is an excerpt from a statement by Dr. J. Mann, director    of the
World Health Organization's special program on AIDS, to the    U.N. General
Assembly last Tuesday:

    The AIDS virus swept across the world, silently, before we even knew    it
existed. However, if AIDS was destined to occur, we were at least    fortunate
that the epidemic came in the 1970s and 1980s, rather than 50    years ago. At
that time, without modern scientific knowledge and    technical expertise, we
would literally not have understood what was    happening. Yet today,
remarkably, only six years after the disease was    first recognized, we know
enough to seize the initiative to stop AIDS.

 I am grateful for this opportunity to describe for you the basis and    shape
of the Global Strategy against AIDS.

     For analytic purposes, it is useful to consider AIDS as three    distinct
yet intertwined global epidemics. The first is the epidemic of    the AIDS virus
itself. The second epidemic, inexorably following the    first but with a delay
of several years, is the epidemic of the disease    AIDS. Unlike most infectious
diseases, such as measles or yellow fever,    in which the disease develops days
or weeks after infection, AIDS may    not appear until years or possibly even
decades after the initial AIDS    virus infection. Finally, the third epidemic,
of social, cultural and    political reaction to AIDS, is also worldwide and as
central to the    global AIDS challenge as the disease itself.

     Because initial infection with the AIDS virus, now officially    called the
Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), is silent, without signs    or symptoms, the
virus was able to spread widely, unnoticed and    undetected, starting in the
mid to late 1970s.

     We do not know the geographical origin of this virus. However, we    are
beginning to receive sound information on the current extent of    AIDS virus
infection. Based on this information, we estimate that    between 5-and
10-million people worldwide may now be infected, and the    AIDS virus appears
to be present, at least to some extent, in virtually    every country.

     In addition, epidemiological studies from throughout the world have
clarified how the virus spreads from person to person; this knowledge    is most
precious, for it tells us how to prevent the spread of AIDS.

 Thus, the AIDS virus is known to be quite limited in its routes of    spread -
limited to sexual contact, blood and spread from infected    mother to child.

     Sexual transmission accounts for the majority of AIDS virus    infections
in the world. Sexual spread of AIDS virus can occur from any    infected person
to his or her sexual partner. Thus, AIDS virus spreads    from infected men to
women, from infected women to men, and from    infected men to men. The risk of
infection from each unprotected sexual    contact with an infected person
appears small, yet infection can occur    following a single sexual contact.

     Spread of AIDS virus through blood occurs through specific,    identifiable
practices, including blood transfusion, sharing of blood    contaminated needles
and syringes by intravenous drug abusers, or reuse    of any needle, syringe or
other skin-piercing instrument without proper      cleaning and sterilization.

     Finally, the spread of AIDS virus from infected mother to child can
occur before, during, or shortly after birth. Recent studies have    suggested
that approximately half of the babies born to infected    mothers will be
infected with AIDS virus. AIDS in children is mainly    due to AIDS virus
infection in the mother.

     AIDS spreads through specific, identifiable human actions, all    subject
to human influence and control; thus, AIDS is controllable and    preventable.
Sexual behavior can be modified, blood for transfusion can    be screened, blood
products can be treated to destroy the virus, and    needles and syringes can be
sterilized. It is most important to stress    that AIDS virus is not transmitted
through food or water; it does not    spread through insects or toilet seats,
swimming pools or telephones,    shaking hands, hugging, coughing or sneezing.
Most importantly, there    is no evidence, anywhere in the world, for casual
transmission or for    person-to-person spread in schools or in the work place.
And thus, AIDS    should be seen as a disease spread by, and controllable
through,    conscious human behavior.

     The second epidemic, of the disease AIDS, follows the epidemic of
infection but with a delay of several years. The epidemic spread of    AIDS
virus in the mid- to late-1970s was followed by the global    appearance of AIDS
cases in the early and mid-1980s. Thus, in 1981,    when AIDS was first
described in the United States, AIDS cases were    already occurring in several
areas of the world.

     As of Sept. 23, 1987, a total of 60,552 AIDS cases were officially
reported to the World Health Organization from 124 countries around the
world. Thirty-one countries have reported 100 or more cases, including    3 from
North America, 4 from the Caribbean, 1 from South America, 10    from Europe, 12
from Africa and 1 from Oceania. Actually, reported    cases are only a fraction
of all cases; in some countries AIDS may not    yet be recognized or reported to
national health authorities, and some    countries remain reluctant to speak
openly or fully about AIDS. Thus,    we estimate that the actual number of AIDS
cases worldwide has been in    excess of 100,000.

     Since the disease AIDS occurs years after the AIDS virus infection,    the
number of AIDS cases occurring today does not tell us about the    present level
of infection in the population. We estimate that for each    AIDS case, there
are likely to be 50 to 100 AIDS virus infected people.

 Thus, AIDS cases are only the visible part of a much larger population    of
AIDS virus infected persons.

     Infection with AIDS virus is probably life-long. The AIDS virus    inserts
its genetic material into the genetic material of some of the    infected
person's cells. Then, the virus can remain in the body,    dormant and hidden,
for years. Most infected people are unaware of    their infection until years or
perhaps decades later. Once the AIDS    virus is activated, it destroys a
critical piece of the immune system    and leaves the person vulnerable and
defenseless against infectious    diseases and some cancers. Some infected
people suffer a less profound    weakening of the immune system and develop
other, usually less severe    diseases, called "AIDS-related conditions." And,
for reasons not yet    understood, in some infected people the virus has
remained dormant and      they have remained healthy.

     At present, we do not know what proportion of the infected people    will
ultimately develop the disease AIDS. According to our best    estimates, in the
first five years after infection, 10-30 percent of    infected people will
develop AIDS and perhaps 20-50 percent more will    develop AIDS-related
conditions. We can only guess what the future will    bring for the large number
of infected people who have not, as of now,      developed the disease AIDS.

     This information suggests that 10-30 percent of the estimated
5-10-million AIDS virus infected peo- ple in the world may develop    AIDS
during the next five years. This would mean 500,000 to 3-million    new AIDS
cases, or a greater than 10-fold increase compared to the                number
of cases thus far. Unless a treatment is found to protect    healthy AIDS virus
infected persons from developing AIDS, we will be    helpless to avert this
large wave of new AIDS cases.

      What about vaccine to prevent infection and treatment for those    already
infected? A human vaccine has never before been made against a    retrovirus,
such as the AIDS virus. Thus, vaccine researchers have been    confronting the
mysteries of the AIDS virus itself, at the frontiers of    virology and
immunology. The discovery in 1986 of a second AIDS-causing    virus, now called
Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type II (HIV-II) has    further complicated the
problem. Nevertheless, with unprecedented    speed, the first candidate AIDS
vaccines have been prepared; initial    human studies are already and will soon
be increasingly under way.

     However, these first trials are only the beginning. The final test    - to
determine if a candidate vaccine actually protects against the    AIDS virus -
must be completed before we can truly claim to have a    vaccine. Under the best
of circumstances and with luck, a safe and    effective vaccine could possibly
become available for use in large    populations in about five years. However,
many experts believe we will    not have such a vaccine until at least the
mid-1990s.

     Remarkable progress has been made toward treatment of AIDS virus
infection. A single drug, zidovudine, also called AZT, has been shown    to be
effective in the treatment of some categories of AIDS; although    AZT has
important side effects and is quite expensive, it does prolong    the life of
persons with AIDS.

     Newer drugs, such as DDC, using similar principles of action, and    taking
full advantage of what has been learned about the life cycle and    function of
the AIDS virus, are under development: it is just too early    to tell if they
will be effective and safe. Recently, important trials    were started to see if
AZT, or other drugs, can block the progression    to AIDS in healthy AIDS
virus-infected people. The personal and public    health benefits of such
protection against AIDS would be enormous.

     The third epidemic relentlessly follows the first two epidemics.

 This is the epidemic of economic, social, political and cultural    reaction
and response to HIV infection and AIDS. This worldwide    epidemic has only
started, yet it is an integral part of the global    AIDS problem. As public
awareness about AIDS grows, as AIDS virus    spreads and as the number of AIDS
cases rises steeply during the next    five years, this third pandemic can also
be expected to intensify.

     The impact of AIDS goes far beyond the health statistics. A    worldwide
AIDS epidemic is a major economic challenge. In    industrialized countries
medical care costs for each AIDS patient range    from about $ 20,000 to over $
100,000 and indirect costs dwarf the    medical costs because it is the young
and middle-aged who most often    die of AIDS. In developing countries, the
medical costs have yet to be    measured. However, in these countries, the added
cost of AIDS on    already overburdened medical care systems must be
considerable.

     The impact of AIDS on social and economic development may be    critical.
AIDS may raise mortality rates several-fold among the    economically and
socially most productive age groups, especially 20-45    year olds. In terms of
social and economic development, AIDS robs    societies of people who are in
their most productive years.

     In areas where 10 percent or more of pregnant women are infected    with
AIDS virus, infant mortality from AIDS alone may exceed the infant    mortality
rate from all causes in industrialized countries. Thus, in    some areas of the
world, the projected gains in infant and child health    anticipated through the
child survival initiatives may be canceled by    AIDS.

     Fear and ignorance about AIDS continue to lead to tragedies: for
individuals, families and entire societies. Unfortunately, as anxiety    and
fear cause some to blame others, AIDS has unveiled thinly disguised
prejudices about race, religion, social class, sex and nationality. As    a
result, AIDS now threatens free travel between countries and open
international communication and exchange.

     Societies now debate what to do with AIDS virus infected people.

 Such persons should, and must, be allowed to remain in society, for at    least
two reasons. The first is that except for unprotected sex, blood    transfusions
and needle-sharing - all of which can be rationally    prevented - AIDS virus
infected persons are not dangerous to others.

 The second is that threatening infected persons with exclusion - or    worse -
will drive the problem "underground," wreaking havoc with    educational efforts
and testing strategies.

     How our societies treat AIDS virus infected people will not only    test
our fundamental values but will likely make the difference between    success
and failure of AIDS control strategies at the national level.

Kool-Aid celebrates 75 years; Oh yeah!l It's named the 'Official Soft drink of
Nebraska,' but Koo-Aid belongs to every kid who grew up on the drink

BYLINE: Amanda Greene, Staff Writer

SECTION: Lifestyle; Pg. 1D, 6D

LENGTH: 1224 words


A frosty gallon of Kool-Aid was always on the refrigerator shelf in Jackie
Lester's house in the family's favorite flavors: lemonade and cherry.

"We used to have it as another drink besides tea because we were pretty heavy
tea drinkers," Ms. Lester said recently while picking up some Kool-Aid for her
sons, Mark, 16, and Shane, 14.

Today, she replaces soft drinks at her house with Kool-Aid so her sons won't
drink so much of the flavored sodas they like.

The "kool" drink inspired Candy Brunson to become an entrepreneur and business
owner at 7 years old, selling cups of cherry, lemonade and grape Kool-Aid
flavors at a stand in front of her house in the summer. She occasionally mixed
them together just to add a fun new flavor to her menu.

"But I didn't become rich. Why do you think I'm still working?" she said,
laughing.

This year, Kool-Aid will celebrate 75 years of being our cool-down on a hot
summer day as well as an integral part of our memories and our culture.

Just about everyone has some memory, whether it's cherry Kool-Aid at snack time
at Vacation Bible School or selling the drink for 5 cents a glass from one of
the stands the company would send through the mail.

Kool-Aid has big birthday plans. The celebration will occur in the town where it
all began, Hastings, Neb. The Hastings Museum of Natural and Cultural History
will open its first permanent exhibit honoring Kool-Aid on the first day of
summer, June 21.

Nebraska native Edwin Perkins invented the drink in 1927, calling it Fruit
Smack, then Kool-Ade in the early 1930s and then Kool-Aid. The first drink was
in liquid form, and Mr. Perkins distilled it to the present powdered form to
save money.

The drink is now the "Official Soft Drink of Nebraska," and more than 800
million packages are sold each year. The town holds a three-day Kool-Aid Days
festival every summer to celebrate the drink's heritage, featuring the world's
largest Kool-Aid stand, which is 75 feet long and serves 15 different flavors.

"We haven't found the exact date yet in all our records for when Kool-Aid was
founded," said Donetta Allen, a Kool-Aid representative. "We know it was some
time in 1927, so we're celebrating all year."

The first flavors Mr. Perkins developed were cherry, grape, lemon-lime, orange,
raspberry and strawberry, but Kool-Aid has gotten much more marketing savvy
since. Today's flavors have gotten a lot more colorful, or as the company calls
them, "Wacky wild, Kool-Aid style." Blastin' Berry Cherry and Slammin'
Strawberry-Kiwi are a few of the newer flavors. Over the years, Kool-Aid's most
indescribable flavors ended up with wacky names such as Rock-A-Dile Red or
Sharkleberry Fin. The only way to know what they tasted like was to take a sip.

About 52 flavors have been developed in Kool-Aid's history, with 22 flavors
active today.

The newest flavor line at Kool-Aid is Magic Twists, where the powder is one
color, but when you add water it changes, and it's a different flavor than the
color suggests.

"We don't reveal the flavor on packaging," Ms. Allen said. "The first part of
creating flavors is making them fun for kids. Then we look at current flavor
trends. Right now, sour is really popular with kids."

And over the years, we've developed a relationship with the Kool-Aid Man. He
began bursting through a wall and onto Kool-Aid packets in 1975.

"I remember watching Kool-Aid Man on commercials as a child, busting through
those brick walls, and he's come a long way," said Ms. Brunson, a teacher at
Classy Bears Preschool.

His wardrobe has expanded over the years from just a rainbow-striped shirt,
jeans and sneakers to today's Hawaiian print shirt, drawstring bathing suit and
flip-flops on the Island Twist varieties of Kool-Aid or fatigues and combat
boots for packages sold on military bases.

Kool-Aid's television slogans also bring back memories.

There's "Kool-Aid, Kool-Aid Tastes Great," "Wacky Wild Kool-Aid Style" and Kool-
Aid Man's first jingle, "Kool-Aid's here, bringing you fun. Kool-Aid's got
thirst on the run. Get a big, wide happy ear-to-ear Kool-Aid smile. 'Cause the
biggest smile is a Kool-Aid smile."

Rhonda Sheppard, 10, has her own version of Kool-Aid's song.

"Kool-Aid, Kool-Aid tastes good. Kool-Aid, Kool-Aid tastes good," she sung. "And
when the color changes, it tastes awesome."

Some are so into the Kool-Aid nostalgia, they've begun collecting Kool-Aid
packets.

One member of the online Kool-Aid Klub professed a love for the drink and
trading the packets.

"Yes, I love Kool-Aid. I have been drinking it since I started school, and when
I die and they cut me open, I will look like a rainbow of FDA-approved colors,"
the member wrote.

At Kool-Aid Days, Ms. Allen said packet traders set up their collections and
trade.

"Kool-Aid packet collecting is quite a flourishing trade. People try to find
packets from different countries and different seasons. I'm amazed at the
collections people have," Ms. Allen said.

But Kool-Aid hasn't slowed down just because of a few gray hairs. It's gone
high-tech with liquid Kool-Aid Bursts in plastic squeeze containers, frozen
Kool-Aid Kool Pops and Kool-Aid Jammers in plastic pouches with clear backs.
Caffeine-free tea flavors entered the scene in strawberry, wildberry and
lemonade in 1999 and were called the Kool-Aid Fruit T's.

No matter the innovations, the drink still is synonymous with school lunches and
cooling off from playing in the sprinklers.

For children at Girls Incorporated of Wilmington, any drink with a fruity origin
is related to Kool-Aid.

"Many times we use (Kool-Aid) for birthday parties and events here, but the kids
refer to every drink we serve as Kool-Aid," said Delores Wallace, director of
operations. Some of the kids there have made up a saying about Kool-Aid:

"You're all in my Kool-Aid and don't know the flavor," meaning that a person is
being nosy without knowing what they're talking about.

Here are some recipes using Kool-Aid:

Kool-Aid Cake

1/4 cup of your favorite Kool-Aid flavor

1 box of cake mix (yellow cake works best in most cases)

Mix the Kool-Aid powder with the amount of water the cake recipe calls for
before adding it to the rest of the cake mix.

Bake as directed.

Kool-Aid tropical fruit flavors go best with the yellow cake, frosted with
vanilla frosting. Try making a black forest cake using a chocolate cake mix and
adding in cherry Kool-Aid mix.

Kool-Aid Cookies

1 cup shortening

1 cup granulated sugar

2 egg yolks

3 1/4 cups flour

1 teaspoon baking powder

1/4 teaspoon salt

6 tablespoons milk

1/2 package dry unsweetened Kool-Aid (flavor/color desired)

1/2 package dry unsweetened Kool-Aid of a different flavor

Cream shortening and sugar. Add egg yolks and beat well. Sift all dry
ingredients together and add the dry ingredients and milk to the creamed
mixture.

After dough is mixed, divide in half. Roll out on wax paper, sprinkle with Kool-
Aid (one color on half, and the other color on the other half).

Put half the dough on top of the other half. Roll up in a roll and refrigerate
at least 2 hours or freeze and slice when needed.

Bake at 350 degrees for 10 to 12 minutes.

Lifesaving words: Ontarians getting facts on AIDS Here is an advance look at
booklet that health ministry will be sending to each household in the province

SECTION: INSIGHT; Pg. A30

LENGTH: 1493 words


   A booklet called AIDS Let's Talk will be delivered by letter carriers to
every household in Ontario, Health Minister Elinor Caplan has announced.

The booklet is part of a two-year, $7 million information and advertising
campaign aimed at the public.

AIDS Let's Talk was first produced in 1987 by the Ontario Public Education Panel
on AIDS, chaired by Dr. Jay Browne of Hamilton. The panel was set up by
then-health minister Murray Elston. The brochure has been minimally updated with
a new cover photo and with Caplan's name on it instead of Elston's.

A French version will be distributed through French-language publications and
versions in Chinese, Vietnamese, Greek, Portuguese, Italian and Spanish will be
distributed through multicultural publications.

The questions and answers in AIDS Let's Talk are reproduced below, followed by
extracts from fact sheets about the disease prepared earlier by the Ontario
Public Education Panel and still available from the ministry.

1. Information about AIDS seems to keep changing. What are the facts about AIDS
that I need to know?

Some things about AIDS do change - such as developments in research and the
number of people who have the virus.

But other things have not changed since the beginning - such as how you get AIDS
and how to protect yourself from AIDS.

All the important facts about AIDS are contained in this booklet. If there are
still questions you would like to ask you can call the Ontario Ministry of
Health hotline at 1-800-668-AIDS, or call your local health unit. (In the Metro
area, the number is 392-AIDS.)

2. What is AIDS?

AIDS is a disease caused by a virus called HIV (human immunodeficiency virus).
The virus destroys part of the body's immune system. People who have AIDS cannot
fight off unusual infections and cancers, and they usually die.

3. Does everyone who has the virus have AIDS?

No. Many people are infected with the AIDS virus but have no signs or symptoms
of illness. Once a person is infected with the virus, it can take anywhere from
a few months to 10 years to become ill. Many people who have the virus will get
sick. Some may never get sick.

4. Who gets AIDS?

Anyone can get AIDS. Most people in North America who have AIDS are men. In
Africa, as many women as men have AIDS. The virus can be passed from man to man,
from man to woman and from woman to man.

5. How can you know who has the AIDS virus?

You can't. Many people have the virus but look and feel perfectly healthy. They
may not even know themselves that they have the virus. But they can still pass
the virus on to others.

6. How is the virus spread?

The virus is carried in blood, semen and vaginal fluids and can be passed from
one person to another through:

* Sexual intercourse with someone who is infected;

* Sharing needles or syringes that contain blood infected with the virus.

The virus can also be passed from an infected woman to her baby in the womb.

7. How can I protect myself from the AIDS virus?

You can protect yourself by understanding how the virus is spread, and avoiding
the activities that put you at risk. To be safe:

* Abstain from sex.

* If you are sexually active, be monogamous. Have only one sexual partner who is
not infected by the AIDS virus.

* Don't have sexual intercourse with anyone who has had a number of other sexual
partners.

* If you have sexual intercourse with someone whose past you're not sure of, use
latex condoms. To be extra careful, women should use spermicidal foam along with
latex condoms. Use a foam that contains the ingredient nonoxynol-9: If the
condom breaks, the foam will help kill the virus.

* Don't use illegal needle drugs. For help to get off drugs, call the Addiction
Research Foundation at 1-800-387-2916. In Toronto, call 595-6111. If you do
abuse drugs, don't share needles or equipment.

* Don't have sexual intercourse with anyone who has used needle drugs.

8. Can I get the virus from touching or being near someone who has the virus?

No. The AIDS virus is not spread by ordinary, everyday contact with people in
school or at work. You can't get the virus from: telephones, toilet seats,
swimming pools, whirlpools, hugging, sharing glasses or dishes, buses and
subways.

9. Can I get AIDS from mosquitoes?

No. The AIDS virus is not spread by insects. The virus cannot reproduce inside
the insect, so even those insects that draw blood cannot pass on the infection.

10. I've heard the AIDS virus is in saliva. Can I get AIDS from kissing?

Very small traces of the AIDS virus have been found in the saliva of infected
people. However, of the many thousands of cases of AIDS reported worldwide, not
one has been caused by saliva. No one ever got AIDS from kissing.

11. I have lived with the same person for the past seven years and we've both
been faithful. Do I have to worry about AIDS?

No. If you've been with only one person since 1978 - and neither of you has used
drugs or had a blood transfusion between 1978 and November, 1985 - you don't
have to worry about the AIDS virus.

12. I am not in a long-term relationship. Do I have to worry about AIDS?

Yes. AIDS is a sexually transmitted disease. You should be careful. Find other
ways - besides intercourse - to express your affection for people. If you are
having intercourse, always use a latex condom.

13. I had a blood transfusion about five years ago. Do I have to worry about
AIDS?

A small percentage of AIDS cases were caused by blood transfusions given before
1985 when scientists did not have a test for the virus. If you received a
transfusion between 1978 and 1985, there's a slight chance you may have been
infected with the virus. If you are concerned, you should see your doctor.

14. I am going in for surgery and may receive a blood transfusion. Do I have to
worry about AIDS?

Since November, 1985, the Canadian Red Cross has been testing all blood
donations. Blood that contains signs of the virus is never used for
transfusions. It is still possible for someone to carry the AIDS virus without
it showing up in tests, but this is extremely unlikely.

15. Can I get AIDS from donating blood?

No. Needles used to take blood are sterile. They are used once and then thrown
away.

16. What should I do about people who have the virus or who have AIDS?

You may not yet know anyone who has the AIDS virus but someday you might. Don't
be afraid. Be understanding. That person is going through all the pain and fear
of anyone who has a deadly disease. He or she will appreciate your kindness and
caring.

The following are extracts from the fact sheets available from the ministry.

Information for

parents and teachers

* Are children at risk if they are in contact with infected children?

If such contact is casual (non-sexual), they are not at risk . . . .

* Is there any risk if a student is being taught by a teacher with AIDS?

No, students are not at risk from routine school activities.

* Will children with AIDS be allowed into school?

Yes, they will, but each case will be assessed individually.

Under certain circumstances, the medical officer of health may decide to keep a
child out of school. . . .

* Will teachers, cooks or other school staff with AIDS be able to work in the
school?

Yes. Since there is no risk to others in the workplace, infected staff will
continue to work as long as their doctors say they are well enough.

* Will parents and teachers be told if there is a child or member of school
staff with AIDS in their community?

No. AIDS - unlike chicken pox, for example - is not a highly contagious disease,
so it is not necessary to tell parents or teachers.

AIDS and

the workplace

* Can I get AIDS from a co-worker who has AIDS?

Being in the same office, working on the same assembly line or using the same
equipment as someone with AIDS, even for a long period of time, does not put you
at any risk of becoming infected with the AIDS virus.

* Can I get AIDS from eating in a restaurant where someone handling the food has
AIDS?

No cases of AIDS have been transmitted through food preparation or food
handling.

* Can people be fired because they have AIDS or are infected with the AIDS
virus?

People who have AIDS or who are infected with the AIDS virus are not a health
risk to co-workers so there is no medical reason to dismiss them.

The Ontario Human Rights Code prohibits discrimination in employment based on a
disabling condition.

* Can an employee refuse to work with a co-worker who has AIDS or who has been
infected with the AIDS virus?

The Occupational Health and Safety Act allows workers to refuse to do a job that
threatens their health. There is no medical reason to refuse to work with
someone who is infected with the AIDS virus.

* Does an employer have the right to know if an employee has AIDS?

The person with AIDS has a legal right to privacy and confidentiality.

Jonathan Glennie and Annalisa Prizzon: Classifying countries according to aid
receipts might be more effective than established methods

FULL TEXT

Last week, new figures from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) suggested that 2011 marked the first reduction in aid for 15
years. Few countries are likely to reach 0.7% in the present economic context.
Does that matter? The 0.7% target is an important symbol, but it can obscure the
focus on what's really important, which is not the proportion of donor income
given in aid, but the proportion of the recipient economy depending on it. High
levels of aid, while sometimes necessary in the short term, are increasingly
viewed as antithetical to development in the longer term.

While it has always been acknowledged that aid should eventually work itself out
of a job, that objective is being voiced more frequently as more and more
countries express their desire for a gradual reduction in aid levels in the
medium term, rather than just over the long haul. When even the president of
Liberia, one of the poorest countries in the world, says she wants to see her
country free of aid dependence in a decade, a significant shift is clearly
taking place.

Last month, we published a report arguing it is time to turn aid measurement on
its head. The report proposes a new classification of countries according to
their aid receipts.

The most familiar country grouping is the World Bank income categorisation on
the basis of per capita GNI: high income countries (HICs), middle income (MICs)
and low income (LICs). This categorisation helps track countries in their
economic growth path. But categorisation by aid receipt may help policymakers in
both donor and recipient countries monitor progress on this other increasingly
important variable - aid as a proportion of the economy. No such classification
yet exists.

We suggest classifying recipient economies in four categories depending on their
level of aid (high-, middle-, low- and very low-aid countries). High-aid
countries (HACs) rely on aid for more than 10% of their GNI, while very low-aid
countries (VLACs) receive less than 1% of their GNI in aid. The other obvious
option would have been to look at aid as a proportion of government expenditure,
as in ActionAid's Real Aid 3 report. However, in some countries significant
amounts of aid are spent outside government systems, and we wanted to know the
role aid plays in the economy overall, not just in the government budget.

The results are interesting. The number of HACs decreased from 48 to 37 between
1990 and 2009, while LACs and VLACs rose from 40 to 54. This chimes with general
opinion about a move away from aid dependency. However, when we split this
20-year period into decades, an interesting picture emerges that appears to
contrast with the conventional wisdom.

In the 1990s, 48 countries, almost half those with data, moved down at least one
band, becoming less aid dependent, while only three moved up (at least) one
band. Contrastingly, in the 00s more countries moved up in the classifications
(20) than down (only 14), implying a general pattern of increasing aid-to-GNI
ratios. In the 00s, the number of HACs actually increased while the number of
LACs/VLACs fell from 47 to 42.

While the trend in the 90s is probably best explained by declining aid levels
during the cold war, the mixed picture in the 00s can be explained by a
combination of strong growth in some countries, leading to a higher denominator
in the ratio, and a significant increase in the aid effort focused on some
countries in particular.

One interesting implication of reading the data in this way is the
differentiation between "reducing aid" and "reducing aid dependence". As
countries grow, they are likely to reduce aid receipts as a proportion of their
national income. While it is tempting to characterise reductions in aid levels
as indicative of reduced aid dependency, the classification of countries by aid
guards against this assumption. Countries that have been LACs or VLACs for
decades may reduce aid without reducing dependency, quite simply because they
were never aid dependent.

This segues directly into the aid to middle-income countries debate, better
known as: "Should we give aid to India?" As donors prioritise reducing aid to
MICs, the report asks what has changed to make them think aid reductions deemed
inappropriate 20 years ago are now appropriate. While the common reason given is
that the new MICs no longer need aid, our data imply they never really needed
it.

Do the present tendencies to reduce aid to MICs have more to do with the changed
financial context of traditional donors than a serious assessment of the
potential continuing role of aid at relatively low levels (as a proportion of
GNI)? This question is vital, especially given that three quarters of the
world's poorest people live in LACs or VLACs, while only about 15% live in HACs
(as a forthcoming ODI paper will show).

Rather than seeking to end aid, one option would be for countries to try and
join the ranks of LACs or VLACs. That would mean bringing aid down to
sustainable levels where returns are higher (if the evidence of diminishing
returns is correct) and the risks associated with aid dependence are reduced. It
is acknowledged that there are diminishing returns to aid levels, and that high
aid can be harmful. However, evidence that no aid is better than low aid is thin
on the ground. Aid at low levels can be an important source of finance for
specific sectors and geographical regions; it can catalyse change, boost civil
society's efforts to hold powerful actors to account, and help to attract other
types of finance.

Does foreign aid do more harm than good?;
The Question

Do developing countries benefit from our help, or does it prevent them from
using their own resources to get ahead? Four experts debate the best approach.
THE RESEARCHER TERENCE WOOD THE simple answer to this question is no. While
aid's critics often make the claim, it is at odds with the evidence. Critics
argue that aid stifles economic growth, promotes corruption and leads to
dependence.

Yet the best available research suggests that on average aid's impact on growth,
while modest, is positive. A recent study from the Quality of Governance
Institute found that since the end of the Cold War aid has tended to reduce
corruption. And the example of countries such as Botswana and South Korea, which
have gone from being poor and reliant on aid to relative prosperity, shows that
aid need not lead to dependency. Critics also claim continued global poverty
shows aid has not helped. But this ignores slow but significant improvements in
areas such as health and education almost everywhere, which partially stem from
aid. Only when critics point to the failures of particular projects do they have
a point. Because while aid has helped on average, some has done harm. From
flawed infrastructure projects to aid given to dictators, there are many
examples of failure. Of course, there are also examples of success. But the
failures are a reminder: success is not guaranteed. Which means the real
question is not whether aid does more harm than good. It is: "How do we ensure
aid works?" There are three simple rules of thumb for better aid: Aid should be
given with good intentions. Some of its worst failures have occurred when it was
given for geostrategic reasons, or given in ways designed to benefit businesses
in wealthy countries. Different things work in different places. Just like
Tolstoy's unhappy families, no two poor countries are alike. Aid needs to follow
context, not formula. Learning is important. Agencies need to devote resources
to research and to learning from experience. Encouragingly, many donors are
improving in these and other important areas. Yet others lag and there is still
much to be done. Aid does more good than harm, but it could do better. THE
STATESMAN MALCOLM FRASER AMID the backdrop of disasters in Australia and when
foreign aid is under scrutiny some who maintain "charity begins at home" may
suggest that aid does more harm than good. My own experience has overwhelmingly
convinced me that aid does far more good than harm. First, in humanitarian
emergencies, lives are at stake. When people are in desperate need of food,
water, medical care and shelter as a result of famine, conflict or natural
disaster, who else will help? Such urgent assistance is the responsibility of
nations and organisations that have the capacity to do so. In 1992 in Somalia, I
experienced the lives of desperate women and children being saved as a result of
foreign aid. Foreign direct investment has far outstripped foreign aid in many
countries. Yet such investment does not seek to reach the poorest and most
vulnerable, it does not seek to ensure significant gains in health or education
nor does it seek the equality of women and minorities. Effective aid addresses
the basic needs of livelihoods, education, health, clean water, sanitation, and
the rule of law for the poor and vulnerable in developing countries. Foreign
direct investment alone cannot break the cycle of poverty for the "bottom
billion" of the world's poor who live on less than a dollar a day. Aid builds
the capacity of people, communities and countries to move out of poverty. This
capacity-building works. Last year alone CARE, the aid organisation which I
founded in Australia in 1987, assisted 10 million children go to school,
improved the health of 35 million people and given 11 million people access to
clean water. AusAID reports that Australian aid has had a significant impact in
the region. Polio has been eradicated in the Pacific and 1.5 million children
have been immunised against measles and polio in Papua New Guinea. Research by
UN agencies has found that the incremental increases in aid over the past 20
years account for an extra 14,000 lives saved per day. These benefits have been
generated from tiny proportions of national budgets. This year in Australia
foreign aid consists of only 1.2 per cent of the federal budget. Aid, foreign
direct investment and trade are all needed to address poverty. But we must
recognise the good that aid continues to bring to hundreds of millions of poor
people around the globe. THE ACTIVIST GARY LEE MORE than 1 billion people live
in extreme poverty. If targeted effectively, foreign aid can make a positive
contribution to improving people's lives, reducing inequality and promoting
justice. A fundamental principle for effective aid is that it should be focused
on reducing poverty and be driven by those whose needs are being addressed. In
other words, the interests and rights of the poor and marginalised must be at
the centre of any program. In reality, however, it is the narrow geopolitical
and commercial interests of donor countries that often determine foreign aid
allocations and conditions. For example, since 2002 more than 40 per cent of the
$178 billion global increase in aid provided by wealthy countries has been spent
on just two countries: Afghanistan and Iraq. Of concern are reports that in some
cases aid has been made conditional on co-operating with or providing
information to the military forces. Although the last review of Australia's aid
program in 1997 called for a shift away from short-term foreign policy and
commercial objectives to one focused on poverty reduction, the practice of using
the aid program to promote Australia's national interest continues. For example,
half of Australian aid to Afghanistan between 2007 and 2009 was channelled
through the Australian Defence Force, which is not required to report or
evaluate the impact of its aid. Australia also relies considerably on Australian
private contractors to manage and deliver programs. Reliance on for-profit
consulting companies has meant that a significant portion of aid money has
bypassed the people who need it most, instead funding Australian companies,
consultants and advisers. A substantial amount of aid delivered by managing
contractors is in the form of technical assistance, which has been criticised
for its high cost and lack of effectiveness. With the review of Australia's aid
program to be completed next month, now is the time to ask whose interests are
being served by Australia's aid program. The practice of using aid to promote
Australia's strategic and commercial interests must give way to a mandate that
focuses on poverty reduction in accordance with the rights and interests of the
poor and vulnerable. THE ACADEMIC HELEN HUGHES "FOR God's sake, please stop the
aid." This is the cry from Africa. To the argument that the West wants to
eliminate hunger and poverty through aid, James Shikwati, a Kenyan, answers:
"Such intentions have been damaging our continent for the past 40 years. If the
industrial nations really want to help the Africans, they should finally
terminate this awful aid. The countries that have collected the most development
aid are also the ones that are in the worst shape. Despite the billions that
have poured into Africa, the continent remains poor." Shikwati shows how food,
clothing and other aid destroys the livelihood of Africans and keeps
exploitative rulers in power. In Dead Aid: Why Aid is Not Working, Dambisa Moyo,
a young Zambian, exposes the way aid supports tyrannical governments. She argues
that aid perpetuates cycles of poverty. Shikwati and Dambisa Moyo are young
democratic Africans appealing to Australia's aid lobbies to stop the aid that is
keeping autocratic, repressive rulers and their hangers-on in power. When first
discovered by Europeans, the standard of living in the Pacific was so enviable
that James Cook had difficulty keeping his sailors from absconding. After 40
years of the highest per capita aid flows in the world - totaling more than $100
billion - social indicators such as maternal and child health and literacy are
among the worst in the world. Australia's pursuit of partnerships with
dysfunctional Pacific leaders has paved the way for China's dominance in the
region, buying political favours with aid. So many young educated Pacific
islanders have fled that there are few democratic voices to evaluate aid.
Village pump, vaccination and mosquito net programs for wide-eyed children make
for "feel-good" television. Yes, some of these programs are effective for a
time. But they have no lasting impact. What lasts are the sums creamed off and
the billions of dollars in government aid that keep dysfunctional governments
devoted to stopping development in power. Whatever the United Nations
bureaucracy gains from increases in Australian aid for Africa, the cost in
oppressed, poverty-stricken African lives is horrendous. Many studies of aid
effectiveness have been undertaken. Some conclude that aid can have positive
effects, if combined with strong pro-development government policies. Many more
show a negative impact of aid on economic and social development. Overall, aid
flows tend not to increase investment or growth or reduce poverty, but to
increase inefficient government sectors.

TEXT:
 [*199]

    On December 18, 1996, the Commission adopted Commission Decision No.
2496/96/ECSC establishing Community rules for State aid to the steel industry.
n1 More commonly known as the Steel Aid Code, this decision is a derogation of
Article 4(c) of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) Treaty which
prohibits all forms of state aid. The primary aim of the legislation was to
establish the conditions under which the granting of state aid to the steel
industry is compatible with the Common Market. This latest Steel Aid Code came
into effect on January 1, 1997, at the expiration of the Fifth State Aid Code
(Commission Decision 3855/91/ECSC).  n2

    In March of 1996, the Commission presented to the Council its proposal to
adopt a new Steel Aid Code. Britain, Denmark, Sweden, and the Netherlands
originally opposed the Commission's recommendation.  n3 These nations sought
more stringent provisions in order to establish fair and open markets for the
steel industry.  n4 After these provisions were strengthened, an agreement was
reached at the meeting of EU Industry Ministers on November 14, 1996. The
Council finally gave its formal assent on December 6, 1996.

    One goal of the Code was to avoid the necessity of Council decisions on
every case under Article 95/ECSC.  n5 If an agreement had not been met by
January 1, 1997, the Council would have had to rule on every individual state
aid case. Every case to emerge from the Commission would have required the
unanimous consent of the Council. Since an agreement was reached before this
deadline, individual determinations were averted.

    The new rules establish that state aid may be granted only to steel
companies for research and development, environmental protection, or full or
partial closings of capacities. In order for state aid to be considered
compatible with the common market, the aid must meet demanding criteria. State
aid which does not meet the requisite criteria is illegal. The aid need not meet
all three sets of requirements, but only that set which is applicable. While
allowing companies to  [*200]  benefit from aid in these three areas, the Steel
Aid Code also protects against subsidies which would distort competition.  n6

    The Steel Aid Code is meant to place the steel industry on an equal footing
with producers of competing materials.  n7 The Code's provisions refer directly
to the Community Framework on State Aid for Research and Development (CFSARD) as
established in December 1995,  n8 as well as to the 1994 version of the
Community Guidelines on State Aid for Environmental Protection (CGSAEP).  n9 As
a result, a Member State may grant aid to steel companies for research and
development and environmental protection utilizing the same rules applicable to
other industries under the EC Treaty.

    The CFSARD establishes the conditions required in order for aid to be
compatible with the common market. The Commission has traditionally favored
state aid for R&D: "Research and development can contribute to renewing growth,
strengthening competitiveness and boosting employment."  n10 The framework
distinguishes among fundamental research, industrial research, and
pre-competitive development activity. These activities are defined in Annex 1.
The Commission draws this distinction on the belief that the closer the R&D is
to the market, the more significant is the distortional effect of the state aid.
n11 Aid that serves as an incentive for companies to undertake R&D activities in
addition to their normal day-to-day operations is considered more favorably by
the Commission.  n12 Member States must therefore demonstrate the incentive
effects of the aid to the Commission.

    Aid may qualify under one of several exceptions. Aid to promote the
execution of an important project of common European interest may qualify.  n13
An additional exception exists if the aid facilitates the development of certain
economic activities, as long as such aid does not adversely affect trading
conditions to an extent contrary to the common interest. However, even these
exceptions are subject to conditions: (1) the allowable intensity of aid will be
determined on a case-by-case basis, (2) aid for industry research generally may
not exceed 50% of the eligible costs of the project, and (3) the permissible
gross aid intensity for pre-competitive development activities is fixed at 25%
of the eligible costs.  n14 The CFSARD lists various circumstances for allowing
aid intensities to be exceeded, but aid may not exceed a maximum gross intensity
of 75% for industrial research and 50% for pre-competitive development
activities.  n15  [*201]

    In order to be permissible, aid for environmental protection must meet the
guidelines established in the CGSAEP.  n16 The goal of the guidelines is to
strike a balance between the requirements of competition and environmental
policy:  n17 "The intention is not to encourage Member States to grant aid, but
when Member States wish to do so to guide them as to what types and levels of
aid may be acceptable."  n18 The guidelines impose a reporting obligation that
requires Member States to supply the Commission with all the information
necessary to show the environmental purpose of the aid and the calculation of
eligible costs.  n19

    The guidelines set out several areas for which aid may be approved in the
environmental realm. The guidelines establish that aid may be authorized for
investment in land, buildings, plants, and equipment for the purpose of reducing
or eliminating pollution and nuisances or for adapting production methods to
protect the environment. The costs that are eligible for investment aid are
strictly confined to the extra investment costs necessary to achieve these
purposes. The rules for investment aid also apply to aid for investment to
repair past damage to the environment. Operating aid is normally not approved;
however, an exception does exist for waste management and relief from
environmental taxes. Operating aid can compensate only production costs above
traditional costs and it should be temporary and degressive in nature. Aid may
be authorized for a project of common European interest with environmental
benefits. Environmental training and consultancy aid may also be permitted.  n20
Finally, after an individual assessment on the merits, aid for the purchase of
environmentally friendly products may be authorized.

    The guidelines distinguish between the level of environmental protection aid
allowed for meeting mandatory requirements, exceeding compulsory standards, and
making improvements where no requirements exist. Where new mandatory standards
have been established, aid can be authorized up to the level of 15% gross of the
eligible costs.  n21 For small and medium-sized enterprises, an additional ten
percentage points may be approved. Since the goal of the Community's
environmental policy is to establish a "polluter pays" policy, no aid is
permissible for compliance with mandatory standards in new plants.  n22 Where
firms want to improve upon mandatory environmental standards and exceed the
minimum level of compliance, aid may be authorized up to 30% gross of the
eligible costs.  n23 The level of aid must be in proportion to the improvement
of the environment and to the investment necessary for achieving the
improvement. If there are no mandatory environmental standards or other legal
obligations for firms, the proportionality condition applies as well.   [*202]

    In addition to aid for environmental and R&D projects, the latest Steel Aid
Code allows a Member State to grant aid for a full or partial closing of a steel
factory. The partial closing provisions mark a change from the previous Steel
Aid Code and were included after Italy had a positive experience with the
Bresciani case.  n24 Aid for partial closings will be granted under very limited
circumstances.  n25 A partial closure can occur for undertakings that are part
of a group of different steel undertakings as long as the group as a whole does
not increase its ESCS production capacity for a period of five years.

    The Code lists requirements for aid to steel undertakings which permanently
cease production (Article 4). In order to be eligible, steel companies must have
been regularly producing iron and steel up to the date of notification.  n26
They must close and destroy the installations used for production within six
months after the cessation of production or six months after the approval of the
aid, whichever is later. The undertakings must have become a legal entity before
January 1, 1996, and must not have reorganized their production or plant
structure since January 1, 1996. This article lists the maximum amount of aid
permissible (Article 4(2)).

    The Code also permits, under certain circumstances, aid towards the costs of
payments to workers who have been laid off or who have accepted early
retirement. The payments must arise from a partial or total closure of a steel
plant that has been in regular production up until the granting of the aid
(Article 4 (1.a)). Payments must not exceed those that are customary (Article 4
(1.b)).

    Article 5 in the most recent Steel Aid Code granted Greece a special
exception. In order to restructure the steel industry, Greece may grant up to
ECU 50 million ($ 62 million) by the end of the year 2000. This figure was a
compromise--Greece had originally requested ECU 70 million.  n27 Production
capacity, however, may not increase as a result of any assistance given by the
Greek government.

    The latest Code also expands the procedural rights of the Commission with
regards to state aid to the steel industry (Article 6). Under the most important
procedural development, even before a final decision is made the Commission may
now require the provisional recovery of aid granted without prior  [*203]
Commission notification or authorization. This provision was added in order to
provide for a stringent and efficient prohibition on illegal state aid.  n28

    The new Steel Aid Code includes several additional procedural elements. The
Commission must be informed of any plans to grant or alter aid, and the
notification must leave the Commission enough time to submit comments. It must
also be informed of plans to grant aid under schemes already approved under the
ECSC Treaty (Article 6 (1)). If state resources are to be transferred to steel
undertakings in the form of acquisition of shareholdings, provisions of capital,
loan guarantees, indemnities or similar financing, the Commission must be
notified and given sufficient time to comment (Article 6 (2)). Before the
Commission adopts a position on aid proposals, it must seek the views of the
Member States (Article 6(3)). Once the Commission suspects that a measure may be
state aid, it must give notice to the Member State concerned and allow the other
Member States to submit comments. A decision should be made within three months
of receipt of the pertinent information (Article 6(5)). The Commission must
inform the Member States of its decisions on proposals.

    In order to maintain transparency, the new Steel Aid Code contains several
reporting requirements. A Member State must submit biannual reports to the
Commission describing the aid disbursed over the previous six months, the uses
of the aid, and the results obtained (Article 7). Similarly, the Commission must
make annual reports on the implementation of the decision for the Council,
European Parliament, and Consultative Committee (Article 8).

    The Steel Aid Code will remain in effect until July 22, 2002, when the ECSC
Treaty expires. After this date, the general rules of the EC Treaty will apply.
In 1995, the ECSC Consultative Committee issued a memorandum which discussed the
situation after the expiration of the ECSC Treaty in 2002.  n29 The Committee
advocated the retention of the strict ban on steel aid even after the
expiration. However, the report recommended that account should be taken of the
exceptions in the Steel Aid Code. The Commission stated that "the strict ban on
subsidies should definitely be retained as a protection from the distortion
effects of favourable treatment for individual undertakings and should also
apply to branches of industry which are in competition with the steel sector."
n30

    Due to the recent improvements in the steel industry, the strict regulations
on steel aid will probably not change in the near future. The industry, which
employs approximately 300,000 people, has improved productivity following major
job losses and capacity cuts.  n31 Analysts say that the steel industry is now
competitive on world markets due in part to restructuring and privatization. The
steel sector has recently shown profits despite the fact that it survives
without vast state support. If the industry can succeed without state aid, the
Commission is unlikely to change its tough stance.

n24  See Commission Press Release, supra note 7. On November 29, 1995, the
Commission allowed the Italian government to grant almost 260 billion lire in
aid to 16 steel companies in the so-called Bresciani case. The aid was designed

Pattern of foreign aid undergoes transformation

LENGTH: 1798 words

DATELINE: Bangladesh


Bangladesh, March 15 -- One of the early proponents of international power and
wealth redistribution ideology was President Julius Nyerere of Tanzania who
mentioned: "In one world, as in one state, when I am rich because you are poor,
and I am poor because you are rich, the transfer of wealth from the rich to the
poor is a matter of right; it is not an appropriate matter for charity" (Bauer
and Yamoy 1977: 27). However, evidence shows that external aid flow does not
always guarantee development of poor countries. Sensible domestic policies and
governance are the key determinants of sustainable economic and social
transformation of the poor countries rather than injection of development aid
which, in most cases, arguably fails to deliver the promised benefits.

In the contemporary development literature, debate on the role of foreign aid in
development is still going on. For example, some researchers argue that the
conclusions derived from the aggregative view on aid are not likely to be
tenable for individual countries whereas the quality and relevance of domestic
economic policy explain the differences in performance among individual
countries despite unprecedented globalisation and increasing interdependence
among the countries in the world.

The issue is thus not simply whether aid increases dependency and reduces the
role of domestic policy. What is necessary is to identify the "essentials of
development aid" that can play the critical role in unleashing the forces of
development of the poor countries and identifying the country-specific ways of
making aid influence, not determine the development of the poor countries. In
the context of the unresolved controversies relating to the developmental role
of external aid, it is important to highlight the importance of country-specific
insights in understanding the mechanisms and processes that explain why, how and
when aid works in particular societies which are key considerations for making
the design and delivery of development aid effective.

The pattern of foreign aid has undergone a striking transformation in Bangladesh
during the last four decades. The average yearly aid totalled US$ 1.3 billion
over the 40-year period. Although aid only accounts for roughly 2.0 per cent of
GNI (gross national income), it constitutes almost 50 per cent of the country's
annual development prgramme (ADP). In this globalised world international
financial cooperation holds a crucial role, especially for Bangladesh, in
bridging the gap between demand and supply of resources for investment and to
offer cushion to our balance of payment. However, the scope of mobilising
concessional aid has been shrinking over the years due to global economic
recession and growing demands for external aid among developing countries. The
primary objectives of resource management are to ensure mobilisation of
government's external resource in line with national development strategy at the
lowest possible cost and to contain debt burden in a comfort zone consistent
with a prudent degree of risk.

AID FLOW, COMPOSITION AND TREND: For the period since independence up to June
30, 2013, a total amount of about US$ 59.31billion of foreign aid was disbursed,
of which US$ 24.66 billion is grant and US$ 34.65 billion is loan. Of the total
amount, US$ 6.76 billion as food, US$ 10.91 billion as commodity, US$ 38.38
billion as project aid and US$ 3.26 billion as budget support were disbursed.

Significant changes have taken place in case of the total aid package to the
country over forty two years since independence. The share of grant is declining
gradually vis-a-vis the share of loan. Considering sources of the total aid
flows, multilateral aid has been growing through years compared to bilateral
aid. Shifting priorities and strategies of the development partners, recent
global economic recession, oil price hike, vulnerable food security and shifting
in global economic power-structure have made aid mobilisation more difficult
than ever before.

Co-ordination with development partners has an important bearing on the
mobilisation of economic assistance. It is facilitated through a variety of
means such as holding meetings regularly of the Bangladesh Development Forum,
greater interaction of the Local Consultative Groups which aims at aid
effectiveness and harmony, regular triangle portfolio meetings of ERD (Economic
Relations Division), donors and project implementing ministry/agencies, etc.
Some key features of the financial year 2012-2013, along with latest available
data related to external aids, are discussed below:

Disbursement: In the FY 2012-2013, a total amount of US$ 2.81 billion was
disbursed which registered a record of disbursement in a single financial year
since independence. Of this US$ 726.3 (26 per cent) million is grant and US$
2,084.8 million (74 per cent) is loan. Of the total amount, food aid, project
aid and budget support are US$ 50.2 million, US$ 2,418.6 million and US$342.2
million respectively. Multilateral donors disbursed lion share of the total
disbursement amounting to US$ 1,858 million and bilateral donor disbursed US$
953 million.

Considering cumulative aid flow over the years, the major multilateral
development partner is IDA followed by ADB. On the other hand, Japan ranks as
the largest bilateral development partner followed by USA. Top 10 development
partners according to contribution have been presented in figure -1.

Figure-1

Changing scenarios in aid composition: Over the past several years changes have
taken place in the composition of foreign aid disbursement. The share of grant
is declining and share of loan is increasing gradually. The share of grant and
loan of disbursed aid was 90.5 per cent and 9.5 per cent in FY 1971-1972 which
stood at 25.8 per cent and 74.2 per cent respectively in FY 2012-2013.
Similarly, multilateral aid has crossed the stock of bilateral aid. The share of
bilateral aid has decreased from 85.7 per cent in FY 1971-1972 to 33.9 per cent
in FY 2012-2013. On the other hand, share of multilateral aid has increased from
14.3per cent in FY 1971-1972 to 66.1 per cent in FY 2012-2013. Moreover, over
time, the flow of food and commodity aid has drastically declined. Food aid,
which was 47.9 per cent in FY 1971-1972, has decreased to 1.79 per cent in FY
2012-2013. Similarly, commodity aid has come down to nil in FY 2012-2013 from
50.8 per cent in FY 19971-1972. On the other hand, project aid has shot up from
1.3 per cent to 98.21 per cent during the same period.

Sectoral allocation of foreign aid depicts that power sector (16 per cent) is
the highest recipient of foreign aid followed by public administration (14 per
cent) and transport (14 per cent). It is notable that infrastructure sector is
the highest recipient as in line with the policy of the government.
Infrastructure gaps are the major hindrance of development in Bangladesh
highlighted by the most of the research organization including Planning
Commission. Public administration sector gets the highest portion of foreign aid
in 2012/13 FY which underscores the need for the improvement in governance. It
is also notable that education sector (14 per cent) gets priority over transport
(9.0 per cent). Power sector gets second highest allocation as expected due to
the dire need to reduce the gap between demand and supply of power generation.

Aid utilisation: Aid utilisation is in a state of a critical juncture. This
criticality arises from slow implementation of projects. Over time, food aid and
commodity aid have lost their pace as important constituents of total aid
package. On the other hand, project aid has become more and more popular and
important mode of assistance considering the purpose of aid. From independence
to June 30, 2013, a total of US$ 59.31 billion of foreign aid was disbursed on a
cumulative basis. As a policy the donors reduced commodity and food aid as a
young nation matures over years. The food and commodity aid is generally
replaced by more and more soft loans. The bilateral aids give way to more
multilateral concessional loan. The share of total food aid, commodity aid,
budget support and project aid have been shown in the following pie chart.

Figure-2

Food aid: Food aid is now availed of in reduced volumes and occasionally
received in larger amount to support natural calamities like floods, cyclones
and unfavorable weather conditions. This is because self-sufficiency has been
achieved in recent years with the increased food production. Although, a
persistent level of food aid is essential to assist the poorest section of the
population and to run the targeted safety net programs like VGD (Vulnerable
Group Development) and FFW (Food for Work). The share of food aid has gradually
declined over the years which is presented in the bar chart below.

Figure-3

Commodity aid: Generally, commodity aid is offered cushion to balance of
payments as well as to finance development projects. Increasing export volume
and tax revenue growth, consistent increased flow of foreign remittance have
eased balance of payment deficit from own resources. In the process, the share
of commodity aid has declined considerably in the recent years and zeroed in FY
2012-2013.

Figure-4

Project aid: The largest share of foreign assistance comprises of project aid.
It is extended by the development partners primarily to finance projects
included in the Annual Development Program (ADP). The share of project aid
excluding budget support has increased over years as shown in figure 5.

Figure-5

Budget support: Budget support is extended in one single- or multi-tranche to
undertake different priority programmes. The payments against budget support are
triggered on fulfillment of certain agreed policy objectives between the
recipient country and Multilateral Financial Institutions. It gives recipient
country more flexibility to align aid spending with national priorities in
comparison to project aid. Therefore, budget support is becoming more popular
form of receiving external aid. However, the budget support does not come by
very frequently. They are usually offered sparingly in occasion where
development partners trigger payment only after recipient countries achieve
previously agreed benchmarks. Disbursement under budget support scheme for last
couple of years has been shown in figure-6.

May is 'Better Hearing Month'

BYLINE: By Kimberly L. Webb Special to the Tribune

SECTION: NEWS; Local

LENGTH: 757 words


May is Better Hearing Month, a time to bring awareness to hearing and hearing
loss. As an Audiologist I would like to answer some of the common questions I am
often asked about hearing aids.

First it is important to know that hearing loss is the third most common health
problem in the United States, affecting over 36 million people. Hearing loss can
have a negative impact on an individual's quality of life. There are different
types and causes of hearing loss. If you suspect a hearing loss you should make
an appointment with an Audiologist to evaluate your hearing. The Audiologist
will also make recommendations for further evaluation and treatment. Hearing
aids are a common recommendation to improve hearing. Hearing aids have come a
long way since the day of the ear trumpets, speaking tubes and other
non-electronic hearing devices.

What style hearing aid can I wear? The style of the hearing aid is determined by
the configuration and degree of your hearing loss. For example, a person with a
mild hearing loss can pretty much wear any style they choose while someone with
a profound hearing loss may be limited to the style that goes behind the ear.

Aren't the hearing aids that go behind the ear old technology? No, there is a
whole new generation of new high tech mini behind the ear hearing aids. These
mini instruments have a slim tube and a very streamlined look. Mini behind the
ear hearing aids are very popular and barely visible.

Are there any hearing aids that are completely invisible? Yes. The LYRIC hearing
aid is 100 percent completely invisible.

The LYRIC hearing aid is inserted deeply into the ear canal. It is an extended
wear hearing aid and can stay in the ear up to four months at a time. This is an
exciting and unique type of hearing aid that has enjoyed a lot of success.

What if I don't like the hearing aid? Hearing aids are regulated by the Food and
Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA states that anytime you try a hearing aid you
have a thirty day trial period. If you are not happy with the hearing aid you
can return it for a refund.

My friend has hearing aids and keeps them in a drawer saying they don't work.
Will I have the same problem? Everybody's hearing is different and opinions of
success are very individual. Be your own judge of your own experience. You may
find that you have a very positive experience with hearing aids. Again, you do
have a trial period to experience hearing aids for yourself.

Why are some hearing aids more expensive than others? Hearing aids vary in price
depending on the style and technology of the hearing aids. Most hearing aids are
digital. But even digital hearing aids vary on what they can and can not do.

Some have more channels of sound sampling, some have more program settings or
perhaps better feedback managers (the technology that keeps the hearing aid from
whistling). Also, as the technology advances, the audiologist can do more to
manipulate the sound and function of the hearing aid.

What is connectivity? Connectivity refers to the ability to have the hearing aid
communicate with telephones and televisions via a blue tooth compatible device.

Hearing aids alone are not blue tooth compatible. Connectivity requires a small
device worn around the neck that has the ability to send the signal from the
blue tooth ready TV or phone to the hearing aids. This technology has really
improved how the hearing impaired person hears television and on the telephone.

Do hearing aids use a battery? Yes, hearing aids use a battery. The battery life
will differ depending on the size of the battery and the drain caused by the
function of the hearing aid. Typically hearing aid battery life is between five
days for tiny batteries to two weeks for larger batteries.

Do hearing aids have any kind of warranty? Yes they do. Be sure to find out if
the hearing aid has at least a standard one year repair warranty. Some
warranties also cover loss of the hearing aid.

I hope you have found this information helpful. If you think you have hearing
loss, contact an Audiologist and have your hearing evaluated. If hearing aids
are recommended, please give them a try. If you are motivated and use the
hearing aids consistently you should do great with them. Hearing is an essence
of our being. Improving your hearing should help improve the quality of your
life. I would be happy to answer any questions regarding this article. I can be
reached at 650-758-5363.

Pacifica resident Kimberly L. Webb is a practicing audiologist at the Kaiser
Permanente Hearing Center in Daly City.

Q & A - WHAT EVERYONE NEEDS TO KNOW ABOUT AIDS

SOURCE: QNP

LENGTH: 2204 words


WHAT is AIDS? ]ACQUIRED Immune Deficiency Syndrome is a disease in which there
is a breakdown in the body's natural immune system. Your immune system is your
defence against infection and some cancers. It consists of white blood cells and
chemicals called antibodies, which are produced by the body to combat invading
infections. Antibodies and white cells are carried through the body in the
bloodstream and into the body tissues. The antibodies attach to viruses and
usually inactivate them; the white cells attack infectious agents and some
cancers and destroy them. In AIDS, white blood cells (lymphocytes) are damaged,
rendering people with AIDS vulnerable to one or more unusual infections or
cancers which do not pose a threat to anyone whose immune system is working
normally. WHAT causes AIDS? AIDS is caused by a virus, the smallest infectious
particle known. Other viruses which affect humans include those which cause the
common cold, hepatitis, herpes, chicken pox, measles and many other diseases.
All these require human cells for them to grow and multiply. The virus which
causes AIDS is known by a variety of names: AIDS-related virus (ARV); human
T-lymphotropic virus type III (HTLV-III); Lymphadenopathy-associated virus
(LAV). Those who are infected can be divided into three categories which
indicate the stage or seriousness of the disease in that person. Category C _
Those people who show evidence of the infection only through laboratory testing,
but who remain quite well over a five-year period. Category B _ Those who have
developed a mild form of the disease called lymphadenopathy syndrome. Category A
_ Those with fully developed AIDS symptoms which lead to death. Not everyone who
becomes infected with the AIDS virus develops Category A AIDS _ in fact only
about 5 percent to 15 percent. Most show evidence of infection only through
laboratory testing. WHERE did the ""green monkey theory" come from? FROM Africa.
Blood samples of 200 green monkeys showed 70 percent were infected with a virus
believed to be related to the human AIDS virus. The infection has few
ill-effects on green monkeys although in another species, macaques, it results
in a fatal immune deficiency syndrome resembling AIDS. COULD the green monkey
have transmitted the disease to man? YES, according to some leading scientists.
Zaire farmers are frequently attacked and bitten by green monkeys raiding crops.
HOW many people are likely to die from AIDS? AT present there is no cure and the
number of cases in Britain is doubling every 10 months. The number of cases in
Britain rose from 19 in 1982 to 52 in 1983, to 111 in 1984 and to 240 in 1985.
By the end of next month the figure is expected to rise to 550 _ and by the end
of next year to 1300. If present tends continue there will be about 12,000 cases
by 1990. The world-wide forecast is 4.7 million cases within 10 years. WHERE is
AIDS prevalent? ON A per capita basis, the 31,646 cases reported world-wide
break down like this: US, 10.5 cases per 100,000 population; Canada, 2.8;
Switzerland, 2.12; Denmark, 1.82; Belgium, 1.73; France, 1.56; Netherlands,
1.01; Iceland, 1; West Germany, .88; Luxembourg, .75; Sweden, .69; UK, .69;
Norway, .57; Italy, .52; Austria, .48; Spain, .46; Ireland, .28. WHO is at risk
from AIDS? THE main at-risk groups are male homosexuals and bisexuals, drug
addicts, haemophiliacs who have received contaminated blood products, sexual
partners of virus carriers and AIDS patients, and babies born to carriers or
patients. HOW is AIDS transmitted? THERE are three main ways: By anal
intercouse, contaminated blood transfusions, and needle-sharing by drug addicts.
However, the virus can be transmitted by a bisexual man to a woman via sperm. In
addition, it is possible for a woman to transmit it to a man through vaginal
intercourse. HOW many people have AIDS and where have these cases occurred? IN
Australia there have been 203 people with Category A AIDS _ 195 males and eight
females. Ninety-nine of these 203 people have died. The eight females have all
contacted AIDS through blood transfusion before the testing procedures, which
are not used on all donated blood. These figures include four children under 9
with AIDS. (Figures correct as at April 29, 1986). AIDS cases by State are: NSW,
139; Victoria, 29; Queensland, 18; WA, 11; SA, 2; Northern Territory, 2;
Tasmania, 1; ACT, 1. In the US at April 7, 1986, there have been 19,181 people
with AIDS. A total of 10,152 of these people have died. In addition to
Australia, the US and Canada, AIDS has been reported in 18 European countries,
at least 21 African countries, the Caribbean, South America and several other
regions including the Middle East and Asia. DOES AIDS have the same risk factors
in other countries? IN general the same risk factors apply wherever you are _
blood-to-blood contact or unprotected intercourse (that is, without condoms).
The risk groups do vary a little. For example, there are fewer intravenous
drug-users identified as people with AIDS in Europe than in the US, and a
greater proportion of females have developed AIDS in Africa. It is recognised
unsterile needles and syringes may sometimes be used in health-care
establishments in less-developed nations. HOW many people have died of AIDS and
can anyone survive? ABOUT half of all people diagnosed with Category A AIDS have
died. The death rate increases to nearly 90 percent by three years after
diagnosis. This leaves some people still alive up to four years after diagnosis,
mainly those with Karposi's Sarcoma (Category B). However, there is no way known
to reverse the damage to the body's immune system or to control the growth of
the AIDS virus in patients. IS AIDS starting to spread outside the known risk
groups? SINCE first identified, AIDS has remained mainly in the same at-risk
groups. There is evidence AIDS can be spread by heterosexual intercourse, but
this has not occurred to any great extent in Australia. HOW contagious is AIDS?
COLD, flu, measles and many more diseases are called communicable because they
can be spread by sneezing, coughing, sharing eating or drinking utensils or just
by being around an infected person for a time. AIDS is not a communicable
disease in this sense and normal casual social contact with a person with AIDS
does not place others at risk. HOW is AIDS transmitted? AIDS is not an easy
disease to catch. All evidence shows it is spread through certain specific
sexual practices, sharing of intravenous needles and syringes or more rarely
through blood transfusions either with whole blood or blood components. Testing
kits have now been installed at all blood banks to avoid contaminated blood
being given. There is no evidence AIDS can be transmitted through air, food,
water or casual body contact. However, it is transmitted through direct
blood-to-blood contact and through semen and vaginal fluid contact during
intercourse. WHAT is the risk of getting AIDS from a blood transfusion? THE
Australian Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service requires all donors to sign a
form declaring they do not belong to any risk group. Additionally, all blood
donated is tested by the Red Cross for evidence of infection with the AIDS
-related virus. Blood which tests positive is discarded. The risk of contracting
AIDS through a blood transfusion is now less than 1 chance in 1 million. CAN you
get AIDS by donating blood? NO. Blood collection centres use sterile equipment
and disposable needles and collection packs. ARE health-care workers or other
occupational groups at special risk for AIDS? NO. Simple safety procedures have
been developed for health-care workers and other occupational groups to minimise
the risk of transmission from blood and other body secretions. Procedures are
simple and effective. Infection with the AIDS-related virus is exceedingly rare
in health-care workers. WHY are homosexual and bisexual males at high risk for
AIDS? WITH anal intercourse the virus is carried in semen and can cross into the
bloodstream from the rectum. Those who engage in anal intercourse without
condoms increase the risk of contracting AIDS, regardless of whether they are
homosexual or heterosexual. The greater number of partners, the greater the
risk. Just one unsafe sexual contact is enough to become infected. WHY is
intercourse linked with the transmission of AIDS? SEMEN and vaginal fluids have
both been found to carry the AIDS-related virus because it can reside in large
quantities in the cells of these fluids. The cells carrying the virus can cross
from the vagina or rectum into the bloodstream and cause infection. WHY are
intravenous drug-users at increased risk for AIDS? PEOPLE who use drugs often
share needles and syringes to inject the drug, and small amounts of blood from
an infected person can be injected directly into the bloodstream of another
person. Boiling needles and syringes is not guaranteed to remove the risk. They
should be discarded after one use. CAN AIDS be transmitted through heterosexual
contact? ABOUT 1 percent of AIDS cases in Australia have been transmitted from
an infected male to a female or from a female to a male by vaginal intercourse.
In some parts of the world, the heterosexual spread of AIDS appears to be quite
significant. HOW do women contract AIDS? IN the US, most women who develop AIDS
also use drugs and probably have shared needles and syringes at some time with
an infected person. A few women have also contracted AIDS through blood
transfusions or through unprotected sexual contact with infected men. DOES
having several sexual partners increase the risk of AIDS? HAVING multiple sexual
partners increases the probability of encountering a sexual partner infected
with the AIDS-related virus. Whether the partner becomes infected is determined
by what kind of sex takes place. IS there a connection between prostitution and
AIDS? PROSTITUTES, both male and female, are more likely to have come in contact
with the AIDS-related virus either from their sexual contacts or by intravenous
drug use. Many prostitutes now insist on their clients using condoms as a form
of protection. CAN use of a condom during sex reduce the risk of AIDS? YES, if
used all the time. However, people should not rely solely on a condom to protect
them from AIDS, because condoms may break, especially if used incorrectly. WHAT
is the incubation period for AIDS? THE majority of people infected with the AIDS
virus will have an acute viral illness within a few weeks of infection. Based on
experience over the past five years, the majority of those infected with the
AIDS-related virus have not developed AIDS. Although the future is not known, it
is probable most will not develop the disease. WHAT are the results of testing
for AIDS? IN Australia, about 40,000 people in high-risk groups have been tested
and about 9000 have shown evidence of infection. In time some of these will
develop AIDS Categories A and B, up to 2.5 percent per year. SHOULD the
Government test everyone for AIDS? NO. There is no indication AIDS has spread
significantly beyond well-defined risk groups. The cost of testing the entire
nation would be prohibitive and unnecessary. HOW is AIDS treated? THERE is no
known cure for AIDS although certain drugs may slow down the action of the
virus. Three years after diagnosis of Category A AIDS, the death rate is 90
percent. Most people infected with the AIDS-related virus do not develop the
disease beyond Category C. IS there a vaccine to prevent AIDS? NO, but
researchers in several countries are trying to develop one. This may be
difficult because the virus can alter its form in the human body. WHAT is
Australia doing to find a cure? A TOTAL of $1.5 million has been allocated for
research into AIDS in 1986, which includes assessment of current strategies,
investigation of the immune system, clinical trials of drugs which may be of use
against AIDS, and comprehensive preventive education programs. Prevention is the
simplest, most important weapon. HOW do children get AIDS? MOSTLY from infected
mothers _ probably by breast-feeding or from blood exchange before or during
birth and occasionally through blood transfusions or blood products in the
treatment of haemophilia. While the number of children with AIDS is expected to
rise as the overall community level increases, cases resulting from blood
transfusions and blood extracts are expected to decrease because of the testing
procedures now in place. IF a child has AIDS, can he/she pass it on to another?
NONE of the identified children with AIDS in the US has transmitted AIDS to
another child in the home, school, day-care or foster-care setting. There is no
case of AIDS which is known or suspected to have been passed from one child to
another. Casual contact, even over a long period of time, is not considered
dangerous. Even though the AIDS virus has been identified in saliva, there have
been no cases transmitted by one child biting another. External contact with
blood, such as in sporting injury is not a danger. A child with AIDS is more at
risk of picking up other nasty infections, such as chickenpox, from other
children, than from passing on the AIDS infection.

Using right hearing aid for adults

LENGTH: 1211 words

DATELINE: Dhaka


Dhaka, Aug. 9 -- Hearing aids are electronic or digital devices which aid in
hearing. The aim of the hearing aid should be to help the person with hearing
loss improve their hearing a conversation so that they are integrated into the
society. However, one cannot expect hearing to become normal after wearing the
hearing aid.There are various factors that determine the type of hearing aid one
requires. The process of hearing aid fitting starts with audiometry, to check
the severity and the type of hearing loss.

Hearing aids can be classified based on several parameters.Style of hearing aid

:Analogue and Digital Hearing Aids:In analogue hearing aids, the sound is picked
up by the microphone and converted into electrical signal. This electrical
signal is amplified by the amplifier, and the speaker converts these amplified
signals into sounds and sends it to the ear through the ear piece. Analogue
hearing aids use telecoil that is compatible with the telephone receiver and the
induction loop system. A digital hearing aid has more advanced features. The
microphone picks the sound and transmits to the silicon chip. The silicon chip
that comprises of millions of electrical components that works together to
process the incoming sound according to which it is programmed. The programming
of the chip processes sounds of specified frequencies and converts the incoming
sound into clearer and more audible sounds. These sounds are then released as
specified amplification level into the ear. A digital hearing aid improves the
clarity of speech for the user.Analogue and Digital Hearing AidsDigital hearing
aids can be adapted to suit the hearing thresholds of the person with diminished
hearing capacity. The volume can be moderated and programmed to filter out wind
and other background noises so that speech is received clearly. Modern hearing
aids come with Bluetooth that can be synchronized to the smart phone. Telecoils
are also found in programmable hearing aids that can be used in some sports and
concert venues.Choosing the Right Hearing AidThe first step in choosing a
hearing aid is to check the hearing ability. Once the correctable or reversible
conditions causing the hearing loss is ruled out, the audiologist measures the
residual hearing ability in each of the specified frequencies. These thresholds
help in programming digital hearing aids.Recommendations while Consulting a
Hearing aid Specialist:Get a family member or friend to accompany you: A close
family or friend will be able to understand the difference in your hearing
ability while trying out a hearing aid or adjusting the programmable hearing aid
.Hearing Aid: SpecialistDiscuss with the specialist: You can discuss certain
issues on hearing and ear with the specialist who helps you in choosing the
right hearing aid. Some of the topics can be tinnitus (ringing in the ears),
vertigo problems, pain in the ears, intolerance to loud sounds, etc.Try before
buying: A few hearing aids can be tried using disposable plugs and you can
experience the new sounds and how it works. Try in noisy and quiet environments
so that you get the feel of it.Extra features: Some hearing aids have extra
features like Bluetooth, telecoil and directional microphones. These features
can be helpful in various situations, but choose them according to your own
requirement.Personalized care: The audiologist can provide a personalized
consultation and counseling for the hearing aid. The professional understands
how your hearing loss can affect your daily activities. The fitting session
includes explanation of how to get accustomed to the hearing aid and its new
sounds, how to take care of the hearing aids and the aftercare services.Factors
to be considered while fitting a hearing aid:Amplification required: Based on
the residual hearing ability, an audiologist selects a hearing aid type that can
provide the required amplification at various frequencies. Digital hearing aids
are programmed to amplify sounds at required frequencies. Hearing aid style:
Based on the requirement and personal choice of the user, an audiologist helps
to choose among behind-the-ear, in-the-ear or completely-in-the-canal hearing
aid types. Dexterity of the user is taken into consideration as the switches and
volume control can be too tiny to handle. Some people prefer discreet models for
cosmetic reasons and can be guided to get the smaller models. Hearing aids with
remote control can be suggested to others. One or Two hearing aids: Humans have
two ears on either sides so that direction of the sounds can be understood.
Similarly, if amplification is provided in both ears, the sound are more
natural, the wearer experiences better sense of direction, improved
understanding of speech in a background noise and a feeling of more balanced
hearing ability. Binaural amplification, or amplification in both ears, can help
avoid 'lazy ear', a condition in which the unused ear tends to deteriorate due
to lack of use.Requirement of an earmold: An earmold is a shoe for directing the
receiver tube of a behind-the-ear hearing aid into the wearer's ear and is
custom-made to fit into the shape of the shell of the outer ear. An earmold is
made of materials like acrylic and silicon. It is different in terms of shape,
size and air vent provision, depending on the personal requirement of the
wearer. Earmolds can also be made discreet for the wearer with minimum occlusion
of the hollow part of the outer ear, though the hearing aid will be seated
behind the ear.EarmoldOther lifestyle factors: Hearing aids come with several
features like telecoils that help in public places with loop systems,
water-proof coatings and add-on plug-in to be connected to public systems. Some
hearing aids are 'set and forget' types where the wearer has to just use the
on-off switches. Hearing aids with remote control can help the senior citizens
handle the controls easily. The user can choose these features as per their own
requirements.Brand of hearing aid: Hearing aids are manufactured by various
companies that provide service through service centers. So, after sales service
is a very important factor while choosing a hearing aid. The user needs to
choose a brand that has a service point accessible to his home or work place.
Cost of the hearing aid is also an essential factor to be considered.Steps in
hearing aid fitting:1. An audiologist will test the hearing
ability.Audiologist2. Various hearing aids will be tried on. Digital hearing
aids will be programmed to suit the hearing ability.3. Trial of hearing aids
will be done and the best suited model can be selected.4. An impression of the
shell of the pinna and ear canal will be taken. This is to customize the shape
of the in-the-ear hearing aids or the earmold in case of behind-the-ear models.5
Counseling is done about using the hearing aid and its controls, getting
accustomed to the sounds and care and maintenance of hearing aids.6. Follow-up
sessions can be scheduled.

Need has little to do with who gets aid

BYLINE: REENA SHAH

SECTION: NATIONAL; Pg.  5A

LENGTH: 1558 words



The neediest country in the world is Mozambique, according to a list of needy
nations attached to the Senate's version of the foreign aid bill this year.
Mozambique's 14-million people earn about $ 100 a year and half of them depend
on foreign aid to feed themselves.

    But Congress didn't earmark any foreign aid money for Mozambique next year.
Its people will end up getting about $ 2 each a year in U.S. aid from a modest
pot of money set aside for Africa as a whole.

    Now consider Israel. Its 4-million people have a per capita income of over $
8,000. That's about half of Americans' per capita income but 80 times that of
Mozambicans. Yet every year, Israel gets $ 1.2-billion in economic aid from
America hard cash, with no strings attached. That amounts to $ 300 for every
Israeli. When military aid is included, Israel's share amounts to $ 3-billion,
comfortably putting it at the top of America's foreign aid list.

    The moral here is simple: Nations that matter to U.S. foreign policy get
more aid. And nations that get a lot of military aid also usually get a lot of
economic aid.

    Israel and Egypt have been the leading two recipients of U.S. aid since
1974. They get the most economic aid to bolster their stability.  And they
corner three-fourths of military aid.

     Egypt, which ranks in the middle of the list of needy nations, will get $
815-million in economic aid next year. Most of the aid is in the form of
projects that build schools and sewers, and cheap loans to help it buy imports
and repay past debts from America.

    The kind of economic aid Israel and Egypt get, called economic support
funds, is specifically aimed at keeping governments that are friendly to the
United States solvent so they stay in power.

    Military aid is given in the form of weapons sales and military training.
Nearly all of the $ 4.6-billion military aid the United States will provide in
1991 will be in the form of grants.

    Israel will get $ 1.8-billion in grants to buy mostly American weapons. And
in addition to the $ 1.3-billion of military aid allocated, Egypt will get $
6.7-billion of debt from past purchases of U.S. weaponry forgiven because of its
stand against Iraq in the Persian Gulf crisis.

    Other top aid receivers also are America's friends rather than nations in
great need of help. Military aid and economic aid for nations strategically
important to the United States swallow about two-thirds of U.S. foreign aid.
Turkey gets $ 500-million in military aid, Greece $ 350-million and Portugal $
100-million because U.S.  military bases are located in these countries.

    "There's no mystery about the fact that the engine behind much of foreign
assistance during the Cold War was the geopolitical calculus," said a State
Department official, who spoke only on condition he not be named. "Those
countries that were key to that calculus got more."

    "Poor nations that aren't geopolitically important to America get aid on
humanitarian grounds," he said. "But the big aid programs around the world were
made to fit the realities of the Cold War."

    Since the end of World War II, America has given $ 372-billion in grants and
loans to more than 100 nations, but most of that money has gone to selected
allies. About a third of it has been in the form of loans, and some $ 50-billion
is still owed to America.

    Immediately after World War II, most aid went toward rebuilding a strong
western Europe so it wouldn't succumb to communism. In the 1950s, most aid went
to South Korea and then to Vietnam. In recent years, the focus has switched to
the Middle East. Aid packages to Israel and Egypt have grown since the two
nations signed the Camp David peace accord in 1979.

    The effect of the end of the Cold War is apparent in some aid decisions for
1991. Many African nations, such as Zaire, Liberia, Sudan and Somalia, which
used to get the largest share of military and economic aid in that continent,
will get nothing but humanitarian aid next year. All won loud reprimands from
Congress for human rights abuses and lack of democracy, even though they had the
same shortcomings when they got U.S. aid in the past.

    "In the absence of superpower tensions, we're going to be able to give
weight to other factors such as human rights," the State Department official
said. "We've said we want to give aid only to those governments that are
democratic."

    Pakistan has had its aid cut because of America's new priorities.  The
administration overlooked Pakistan's covert nuclear program for the last decade
because the nation was a buffer to Soviet-occupied Afghanistan. But after the
Soviet withdrawal, the Bush administration raised concerns about Pakistan's
nuclear ambitions and Congress canceled its customary $ 500-million aid package.


    Although the end of the Cold War has erased America's need to maintain
anti-Soviet buffers on the global chessboard, aid is still politically
motivated. The most recent casualty is Yemen, whose $ 42-million aid program is
"under review," according to a State Department official. Yemen, one of the
poorer nations in the Middle East, mostly got cheap loans to buy surplus
American food.  But that aid may not resume because Yemen, a member of the
United Nations' Security Council, didn't endorse the U.S.-led resolution to
authorize the use of force against Iraq.

    Some members of Congress want to change the basis of giving aid on
humanitarian rather than political grounds. Earlier this year, Senate Minority
Leader Robert Dole proposed a 5 percent cut in the aid share of Israel and Egypt
so that this money could be spent on eastern Europe and emerging democracies.
His proposal was shot down.

    "It's almost like an entitlement program" for Israel and Egypt, said Marc
Cohen of Bread for the World, a Washington group that advocates aid on
humanitarian grounds. "They get the same amounts every year, no questions
asked."

    This year, instead of cuts, Israel and Egypt got more. After Egypt got half
its $ 14-billion debt to the United States forgiven, Israel lobbied for a
similar waiver. Congress said it couldn't, but threw in other benefits to
sweeten the deal: Israel will get $ 700-million worth of excess Defense
Department military equipment.

    Israel has received the highest amount of military and economic aid for the
last 15 years. It has garnered special privileges for itself.

    As a rule, all American aid is expected to be spent on U.S. products or on
projects supervised by American officials. Not Israel. It is the only nation
that gets its economic aid as a cash grant and doesn't have to buy only U.S.
products.

    It can use $ 200-million of economic aid for military purposes an exception
allowed to no other country.

    It can use some of its military aid to finance its own weapons research. All
other aid recipients are required to buy American weapons and training.

    Israel is the only country to get practically all its aid at the beginning
of the fiscal year. It gets all its $ 1.2-billion economic aid and 80 percent of
its $ 1.8-billion military aid transferred to it by the first month of the
fiscal year.

    Because America's budget operates at a deficit, the United States borrows
this money and transfers it in a lump sum to Israel instead of spending it in
spurts, as in the case of other nations. Israel earns an additional $ 70-million
in interest because of this early transfer.

    Lobbyists and advocates of aid to Israel say the nation deserves to be
rewarded generously for being a steadfast ally in a troubled region. "A strong
Israel serves America's interests," said Toby Dershowitz of the American Israel
Public Affairs Committee in Washington.

    America gets handsome returns for its aid to Israel, said David Harris, vice
president of the American Jewish Committee. The value of the intelligence Israel
shares from its satellite data and captured Soviet weaponry is "in the tens of
billions of dollars," Harris estimated.

    Harris said he favors more aid to other impoverished regions in the world,
but given America's unwillingness to spend more, aid to Israel is aid that is
well spent: "It's inappropriate to penalize a longstanding friend in order to
help new friends."

    Although foreign aid is unpopular in Congress because of its negative image
and most lawmakers argue over who should get it, there is strong bipartisan
support for aid to Israel, Harris said. "Aid to Israel is the locomotive that
has pulled the otherwise unpopular train of foreign aid through Congress.

    "If there was no aid to Israel, Congress would never be able to agree on
getting out a foreign aid bill every year," Harris said.  "There simply is very
little support for foreign aid and very little understanding of how it works in
this country. If you speak to members of Congress, they themselves will tell you
that aid to Israel and Egypt provide a clear realization of America's goals."

DEPARTMENT: LEGAL PRACTICE TIPS: VISUAL AIDS: 20 RULES TO APPLY WHEN MAKING
PRESENTATIONS

By David J. Dempsey

David J. Dempsey is a practicing trial attorney and a general partner in the
Atlanta, Ca., firm of Coleman & Dempsey. He is also an adjunct professor
teaching public speaking at Oglethorpe University in Atlanta and an
award-winning speaker. This article has been excerpted from "Legally Speaking:
40 Powerful Presentation Principles Lawyers Need to Know," by David J. Dempsey,
J.D. For more information about the book or additional public speaking tips,

TEXT:


 [*35]  Believe nothing of what you hear and only half of what you see.

   --Procerb

   Visual aids are very beneficial, but they have drawbacks: they may be
in-appropriate for a particular audience or setting; they may appear cluttered,
confusing or unprofessional; or the speaker may not have mastered the crucial
techniques of using visual aids effectively.

   Follow the guidelines discussed below when creating and using a visual aid.
Plan for the unexpected, because if anything can go wrong with a visual aid
during a presentation, it usually will.

1. Ensure that the visual aid is visible.

   Far too frequently, visual aids are hard to see. The lettering or the graphs
are so small that even the speaker standing right next to the visual aid strains
to read them. Other times, the speaker displays an object that is difficult to
see. Make your visual aid visible from every vantage point, and if you cannot,
either use a different visual aid or none at all.

2. Design the aid with an audience and room focus.

   Understand the room setup beforehand, including the size of the audience, how
the seating will be arranged and the distance from where you will speak to the
farthest point where an audience member will be sitting . . . and all other
details essential to the effective use of a visual aid. You will be unable to
select or create the proper visual aid without this vital information.

3. Highlight only key concepts.

   Speakers frequently attempt to use a visual aid to present every point in
their presentations, and that can result in confusion and clutter. Focus on the
key points that you want to reinforce with an audience or a jury. Use numbering,
lettering or bulleting to facilitate easy understanding of the visual aid. Limit
the number of lines per page, as too many lines make a visual aid difficult to
read.

   ___

When the eyes say one thing, and the tongue another, a practiced man relies on
the language of the first.

   --Ralph Waldo Emerson

   ___

4. Design horizontally.

   Your audience members are accustomed to reading material horizontally across
the page from left to right, not vertically from top to bottom. You should,
therefore, design your visual aid so that as you reveal a point, the audience
will begin to review it on the left side of the page and read to the right side
of the page.

5. Limit the number of visual aids.

   If you use multiple visual aids, their impact may be diminished. Use one or
two clear, concise visual aids, and you will be far more likely to leave a
lasting impression with your audience members or jurors.

6. Select appropriate lettering and fonts.

   Use crisp, easy-to-read lettering, and use no more than two font styles per
page. Artistic, cursive text is frequently illegible. The size of the lettering
will be dictated by the size of the audience. A visual aid that may be
appropriate for a courtroom setting, where only 12 people will view it in close
proximity, may be useless at a luncheon meeting with 100 people. If your
handwriting is hard to read, consider enlisting a member of the audience or a
paralegal to assist you. Using an assistant will also help you maintain your
focus on the audience.

7. Use vibrant colors.

   Audiences today are accustomed to vivid colors and striking images as a
result of their exposure to television, movies and the Internet. A colorful
visual aid has more impact than one that is black and white. You can use colors
to highlight key points, to focus an audience's attention, and to show
contrasts. However, too many colors become distracting, so use no more than two
or three colors per visual aid.

8. Cautiously embrace technology.

   The elaborate multimedia and computer-aided visual aids available to speakers
today are incredible. When  [*36]  they work and are used correctly, they can
amaze an audience. But they have several disadvantages, not the least of which
is that they frequently do not work. When a visual aid involves technology, the
likelihood of problems increases significantly. You must be extremely
comfortable with computer electronics and know how to set up your system and
resolve the inevitable problems that arise, including devising an alternate
plan. Master this technology before attempting to use it with an audience so
that using it seems effortless. In addition, do not allow your message to be
overwhelmed by the wizardry of computer technology.

9. Use only professional visual aids.

   If you do not have the time, the resources or the expertise to create visual
aids that are professional in appearance, retain the services of someone who is
eapable of doing so--or do not use a visual aid. A visual aid that is created in
a sloppy fashion damages your professional image.

10. Practice your presentation using the visual aid.

   Both inexperienced and professional speakers have had presentations
undermined by unexpected problems with their visual aids. Practice your
presentation with the visual aid so that you can use it effortlessly in front of
the audience or jury. Practice flipping the pages, revealing information,
writing on the transparencies or white board and changing slides. Use the visual
aid exactly as you intend to use it during the presentation in order to become
entirely comfortable with it.

11. Practice in the room where you will speak.

   While it is not always feasible, your confidence will be greatly enhanced if
you are able to practice using the visual aid in the room where you will make
your presentation. For example, if you practice your opening statement or
closing argument in the courtroom where the case will be tried, you can move
about the room and view the visual aid from the jury box, the witness stand or
the judge's bench. Determine whether there is any glare; whether the visual aid
is visible from every angle to the jury, the judge and the witness; and whether
the electrical sockets are accessible.

   ___

My task is, before all, to make you see.

   --Joseph Conrad

   ___

12. Arrange your accessories.

   For every presentation, you should create a checklist of all the additional
accessories you will need to use the visual aid. Your checklist should include
items such as nonpermanent markers, masking tape, pointers, extension cords and
even additional light bulbs for your overhead projector. Decide where you will
place your visual aid accessories when you speak. If you are using a pen, a
marker, a laser pointer, a remote control or another instrument during the
presentation, use it and then set it down immediately when you are finished. Do
not twirl it, bounce it, spin it, wring it or use it in any other manner that
will distract the audience members or jurors.

13. Arrange for transportation of the visual aid.

   Before the day of the presentation, arrange how your visual aid will be
transported. You should not be concerned about having to lug a heavy or
cumbersome visual aid around the building right before you speak or be stressed
over whether or not your visual aid will arrive on time. Investigate the room
where you will be presenting. Can you set up the visual aid well before the
audience or jury begins to filter into the room? Will it be necessary to retain
the help of an assistant  [*37]  from your office, the courtroom or a local
college to help you with transporting and setting up the aid? Answer these
questions early to eliminate last-minute scrambling.

14. Protect the visual aid.

   If the visual aid is a photograph, poster or chart, make sure that it is kept
in a location that is dry and flat so it is not damaged. One speaker spent an
entire speech using one hand to hold down a poster that was constantly rolling
up because it had been stored in a tube for two weeks before the presentation.
He was tethered to the visual aid, unable to move about or gesture at will.
These are challenges you should avoid.

   Ideally, have your visual aid in place, tested and ready to go before the
audience arrives; otherwise, be prepared to set up quickly when it is time for
your presentation. The audience is immediately forming conclusions about
you--even before you begin to speak--so it is important to appear well prepared
and confident, not flustered and disheveled.

15. Focus on the audience, not the visual aid.

   A visual aid should strengthen the message but never become the focus of a
presentation. Unfortunately, we often become mesmerized with our visual aids,
staring at them instead of connecting with the audience. Just as speakers often
talk to their notes, many talk to their visual aids. Your focus should be on the
audience.

16. Reveal only when ready.

   Do not display any part of your visual aid until you are prepared to do so.
Showing all five points of your presentation on the overhead projector before
you begin to speak diminishes the impact, eliminates suspense and may cause the
audience members to lose interest in your message. Control the timing and flow
of your presentation to hold the audience's attention.

17. Use the visual aid Instead of notes.

   Your visual aid can serve as an excellent substitute for notes. You can
quickly refer to the visual aid to prompt yourself in the presentation and
ensure that your presentation flows in the manner you planned. This will allow
you to move away from the lectern, which will result in a more natural,
conversational presentation.

18. Point or gesture to the visual aid with the closest hand.

   Since your audience members are accustomed to reading from left to right,
stand to the left side of the visual aid, and point or gesture toward it with
your left hand. Do not position yourself or point to the visual aid in any
manner that will cause you to turn your back on the audience.

19. Allow the audience members or jurors to study the visual aid.

   Before removing a visual aid or moving ahead in the presentation, observe the
audience members or jurors. Are they studying the visual aid? Are they taking
notes? Is the material depicted on the visual aid so complex that it deserves
extra time? Remember that what is very familiar to you (because of your detailed
preparation) may be foreign and confusing to members of your audience or jury.
Allow enough time for them to study and absorb the message of the visual aid.

20. Remove the visual aid when the point has been made.

   When you are finished referring to a visual aid remove it--turn off the
projector, darken the screen or flip the chart. If you do not do this, the
audience will often continue to focus on the visual aid and the point you have
already made rather than your next  [*38]  point. This is especially true if the
visual aid is vibrant and captivating.

   Expert presenters agree that visual aids are an enormously powerful vehicle
to drive home your points, but using them effectively requires patience and
practice. When the success of your presentation depends on the effective use of
a visual aid, leave nothing to chance. Early, detailed and careful preparation
will help ensure that the visual aid is your ally in front of every jury and
audience.

Learn the facts about AIDS - for your children's sake

BYLINE: BRUCE A. EPSTEIN

SECTION: FLORIDIAN; PG; PARENTAL GUIDANCE; Pg. 1D

LENGTH: 1678 words



Today's children are concerned about AIDS, and for good reason. It is  estimated
that one American is infected with the AIDS virus every 13 minutes.

Everyone agrees that education is our best defense against the deadly HIV
(human immunodeficiency virus). Unfortunately for children, learning about  AIDS
can be difficult because of all the confusing and inaccurate information  they
receive from their friends.

It is essential that parents have a clear understanding of the disease so  that
they can teach their children about AIDS before it is too late. Take this  self
test to review your personal knowledge of AIDS so you can give your  children
the right facts!

True or false

1. The AIDS virus is very hardy and can live outside the body.

2. You can catch AIDS after drinking from the glass used by an HIV-infected
person.

3. It is highly unlikely to contract AIDS from a blood transfusion.

4. Going to the dentist puts you at risk for becoming infected with the  AIDS
virus.

5. Your children can catch AIDS from attending school with a classmate who  is
infected with HIV.

6. You can get AIDS from shaking hands with someone who has AIDS.

7. A child can get AIDS from mosquito or other insect bites.

8. The most common cause of AIDS among children under 12 is being born to  an
HIV-infected mother.

9. The AIDS virus takes over the cells in the infected person's immune  system,
destroying the cells' disease-fighting capabilities.

10. The body fluids most often implicated in the transmission of AIDS are
semen, vaginal secretions and blood.

11. An adolescent has sexual intercourse with a known HIV-infected partner
without practicing "safe sex." An AIDS antibody test is negative four weeks
after the relationship. One can say that the adolescent has not been infected
with the virus.

12. The HIV antibody test is positive but the individual has no symptoms.  He or
she cannot pass the virus on to others.

13. An individual with a positive antibody test showing infection with the  AIDS
virus can show no symptoms for five years or more.

14. AIDS occurs only in gay men and women.

15. All individuals infected with HIV have AIDS.

16. There is no cure for AIDS.

17. You can contract HIV by donating blood.

18. AIDS cases among teens are rising at a rate of 60 percent a year.

19. Most infants born with AIDS infections have died by 18 months of age.

20. If a dog bites someone with AIDS, and then bites you, you can catch  AIDS.

21. The AIDS virus is so deadly that all hopes of making a vaccine against  it
are useless.

22. Condoms are an effective means of preventing the spread of AIDS.

23. The first case of AIDS was described in the early 1980s.

24. AIDS commonly affects the body but not the mind.

25. If you have unprotected sex only once with someone who has AIDS, you  cannot
catch AIDS.

The answers

1. False. The AIDS virus is quite flimsy and dies when the fluid it lives  in,
usually semen or blood, is exposed to air and dries out. It does not live  long
or well outside the human body, probably for not longer than a few hours.
Wiping up the fluids with household bleach can kill the virus. In addition,  the
virus can be washed from the hands or skin with regular soap.

2. False. There have been no reported cases of AIDS being transmitted from
using silverware, glasses or any other eating utensils used by an HIV-infected
person. Furthermore, you cannot get AIDS from food that has been handled,
prepared, or served by someone who is infected with the AIDS virus.

3. True. HIV infection from blood transfusion is rare. Since 1985, when  blood
banks began routinely testing donations, fewer than 20 cases of AIDS  have been
traced to transfusions. In the interest of making the blood supply  as safe as
possible, donors are screened for risk factors, and donated blood  is tested for
the AIDS antibody. People known to have contracted AIDS from  transfusions, such
as tennis pro Arthur Ashe, were infected before 1985.

4. False. The likelihood of contracting HIV from a dentist, while possible,  has
always been remote. And now that all health-care workers operate under  strict
government standards known as "universal precautions," the chances  are
negligible. The highly publicized cases here in Florida involved a dentist  who
apparently infected his patients on purpose.

5. False. One of the saddest commentaries of our times is uneducated  parents
protesting the attendance of HIV-infected children in their children's  schools.
There has never been a child or teacher who contracted HIV in this  way. The
virus is not transmitted through the air, or by sneezing or coughing.  HIV does
not live on toilet seats, or other everyday objects, even those on  which body
fluids may sometimes be found, including doorknobs, phones and  drinking
fountains.

6. False. There has never been a reported case of AIDS being transmitted by
casual contact (such as handshakes or hugs).

7. False. The scientific community is well-convinced that insect and  mosquito
bites are not a mode of transmission. It is important to remember  that while
mosquitoes do withdraw blood from people, they do not exchange  blood between
people. In addition, mosquitoes are incapable of reproducing the  AIDS virus.
You cannot get AIDS from bed bugs, lice, flies, or other insects.

8. True. More than 85 percent of childhood AIDS occurs from perinatal
infections - that is, their mothers are infected with the AIDS virus and pass
this infection on to the fetus before they are born. Before 1985, a number of
children were infected through blood transfusions or the use of blood products
to treat the bleeding disease hemophilia.

9. True. The AIDS virus leaves the infected person vulnerable to a variety  of
unusual, life-threatening illnesses. The virus then uses the reproductive
mechanism of the cell to make more viruses. This is one of many reasons that  it
is difficult to control the AIDS virus.

10. True. The AIDS virus has been found in blood, semen, urine, vaginal
secretions, spinal fluid, tears, saliva and breast milk. Of these, only semen,
vaginal secretions and blood are implicated in transmission. There are also
cases in which babies have contracted AIDS through infected breast milk. Feces
is also considered a risk because it often contains blood. There has not been  a
single case of transmission of the AIDS virus by saliva, perspiration, urine  or
tears. Apparently, the concentration of the virus in these fluids is not  strong
enough to cause infection.

11. False. The adolescent may have been infected by the virus but has not  yet
produced antibodies. Research indicates that while most people will  produce
antibodies within 2-12 weeks after infection, some people will not  produce
antibodies for six months or more.

12. False. Most people with HIV antibodies have the virus in their bodies.
Therefore, a person with a positive test must assume they are capable of
passing the virus on to others under the correct circumstances.

13. True. The most recent research suggests the average length of  incubation is
seven to eight years. Some people have been infected with the  AIDS virus for 10
years and still have no symptoms, and some researchers  suspect the virus could
incubate for as long as 15 to 20 years in some people.

14. False. Most people with AIDS in the United States are gay men, but the
incidence is quickly rising in heterosexual men and women, especially
adolescents. AIDS does not discriminate. People who have died of AIDS in the
United States have been male and female, rich and poor, white, black,  Hispanic,
Asian, and native Americans.

15. False. Once a person is infected with HIV, the virus will be present  for
life. But HIV infection is not the same as AIDS. People with HIV infection  may
be free of symptoms for years, and AIDS occurs only after the immune  system is
destroyed by the virus and symptoms develop.

16. True. While there are promising new medical treatments that can  postpone
many of the illnesses associated with AIDS, there is no cure for  AIDS.

17. False. The needles that are used for blood donations are brand new.  Once
they are used, they are destroyed. There is no way you can come into  contact
with the AIDS virus by donating blood.

18. True. The adolescent age group has the highest rate of new AIDS cases,
faster than the rate of increase among adults. Twenty percent of the AIDS
patients are 20-29 years old, and most were infected with HIV during their  teen
years.

19. True. Unlike adults who can carry HIV a number of years before  developing
AIDS, newborns who are infected by their mothers often are quite  ill by one
year of age. This is probably because a newborn does not have a  fully developed
immune system and therefore is very sensitive to the virus.

20. False. Animals cannot catch this illness from people, and people cannot
catch it from animals. It is true that cats and monkeys can get their own
version of the disease, but this cannot be transmitted to humans.

21. False. Many experts are confident that an AIDS vaccine will be  available
within the next 10 to 15 years.

22. True. Although not 100 percent, the correct use of condoms will  decrease
one's chances of catching the AIDS virus from a high-risk encounter.

23. False. Medical research has revealed that a teenager who died in the  early
1960s may have in fact died of AIDS.

24. False. All AIDS victims who live long enough develop a thinking  disorder
known as AIDS-related dementia.

25. False. AIDS can be transmitted during any sexual encounter with an
HIV-infected person.

Under what terms would you accept a new classmate who had AIDS?

SECTION: DISTRICT WEEKLY; PAGE J6; STUDENTS SPEAK OUT

LENGTH: 1743 words


Scientists have determined that AIDS is not transmitted through casual contact
with a person carrying the AIDS virus, yet persons who have AIDS are often
treated as outcasts. Under what terms would you be willing to accept a new
classmate who had AIDS?

I would accept an AIDS patient under the same terms that I would accept a
student without AIDS. AIDS is a fatal disease, and I am afraid of catching it,
but that doesn't give me the right to treat a person with AIDS like an outcast.

The threat of the disease should make us more health-conscious and more
attentive to good hygiene. Schools, like other public places, should rigorously
enforce laws providing for sanitary water fountains and rest rooms. When
everyone is clean and careful, the risk of contamination -- even from AIDS -- is
minimized. ALMETTA HIBLER Roosevelt

It would be scary, but I would be willing to accept a student who had AIDS. It
would be scary because I really don't know if the doctors are right that you
can't get AIDS from casual contact. If it could proven that you can't, I would
not mind having him or her as a classmate.

I know that AIDS can be transmitted only by blood transfusion or sexual contact,
but if an accident occured in the classroom and the classmate with AIDS got a
cut, he might transfer his AIDS to someone else.

If someone has AIDS, I don't think it should be a problem in school. If everyone
knows, they won't have sexual contact with him or her. You can be his or her
friend and you won't get AIDS. UNID NUN

EZ MCIP

I would not under any circumstances accept a person with AIDS in my class. I
still believe there is a possibility of contracting AIDS through casual contact.
If not, how can you account for the undetected cases? How can you trace evidence
that a person caught AIDS casual contact? How do scientists know there were no
viruses on the sink?

I would not put the person on the spot, so to speak, but I would discreetly edge
my way out of his presence. I understand the victim's emotions; he does not like
to be an outcast. I respect that; it's normal. But haven't the diseased always
been outcast among the human race? A person contaminated with AIDS has no more
right in a classroom than a person with chicken pox. Although chicken pox is not
fatal, AIDS is! MELODY FLOYD Eastern

I think that the public's ignorance about AIDS is outgrageous. If people would
open their eyes and realize that people with AIDS are not the monsters they are
made out to be, then maybe the public will come to its senses and accept them.

There is an old saying that you should not judge a person until you have walked
a mile in his shoes. The public should take this into consideration when they
are condemning their brothers and sisters in Christ. LASHONDA ALDERMAN Holy
Spirit

Naturally I am concerned about the people who attend my school; but if a student
with AIDS were to come to my school, I don't think there should be any rules,
conditions or regulations he should have to follow in order to go here.

AIDS should be treated just like any other deadly disease like cancer or
leukemia. If a student were to come here with cancer or another deadly disease,
the school system would not treat them any differently and would let them attend
school.

Why can't AIDS victims be treated the same? STEPHANIE CROCKETT Ellington Even
though scientists have determined that AIDS is not transmitted through casual
contact with persons carrying the AIDS virus, it is hard for me to actually feel
comfortable around those persons. Considering the fact that this virus is
incurable and fatal, I could under no terms accept a new classmate who has AIDS.

I would not be rude or disrespectful; however, at the same time, I would avoid
any contact at all. After all, I'm looking out for myself and I'm not willing to
take any risks involving this incurable, fatal virus.

This virus is presently taking and has already taken many lives. As far as I am
concerned, having any contact with a person who has this virus is taking a risk.
If they are not sure how to cure AIDS, how can they be so sure about the way you
can catch it?

Treasuring my health as I do, I would be dishonest if I said I would welcome a
classmate with this virus. I would rather not deal with this type of challenge.
KORIKA WILLIAMS Woodson

AIDS victims are the new minority. As blacks have fought for many years for
certain constitutional rights, AIDS victims will be forced to do the same.

It has been proven that AIDS cannot be contracted through casual contact. How
many blood transfusions will be made during the course of the school day?

AIDS victims have the right to a free education. I believe they should be
treated fairly and equally. Just because they are ill does not mean they are not
human. RHEA JOYNER McKinley

If I were attending a school where one of my classmates was an AIDS victim, I
would not rebuke her. Perhaps I might be pitying and curious as to how she
contracted the disease, but I would not treat that person any differently than I
might treat any of my other friends.

Everyone, of course, has their own opinion about this controversial issue, but I
don't see the logic behind alienating and rejecting a person solely because they
suffer from AIDS -- a disease that could pose no threat to any classmate unless
there were intimacy of some kind.

And I furthermore submit that those who contend that children suffering from
AIDS shouldn't be able to attend "normal" schools are only a step above bigotry.
LETITIA HARRIS All Saints

Our one of our teachers had been very sick over the summer. After a substitute
teacher had replaced him for the first couple of weeks of school, an
announcement was made in chapel. The announcement came as an incredible shock to
the student body and all walked out of the chapel service dumbfounded. Our
teacher would soon return to teach; however, he had AIDS.

Every student, and especially those taking biology, had received an impressive
education on AIDS: how it could be transmitted, and the course the disease took
once in the body. This education greatly reduced the problem of ignorant fear of
AIDS.

The major source of hysteria across the nation when people with AIDS try to
enter a closed community, like a school, is ignorance. We had almost eliminated
the fear and rejection that our teacher might have experienced. Our support and
lack of fear strengthened him and he quickly rejoined the school community.

I have participated in an educational film on AIDS with Surgeon General Koop.
Such measures to promote factual information on the subject of AIDS will dispell
fears across the nation, as they did in my school. People must learn that casual
contact to a person with the disease will not transmit the virus. ALDEN HALL St.
Albans

I think that students who have AIDS should not be allowed to attend schools. I
say this not because I feel I would contract the disease, but because, in order
for a student with AIDS to be admitted, the whole school would have to know
about him. This would only alienate the person and make things more
uncomfortable.

The few (very few) aware people would not be bothered by the student. But the
rest, who are quite unaware of how AIDS is transmitted, would make life
miserable for the carrier.

I think that all students with AIDS should be put in a special school with
others who have the disease so that they have people around them who understand
them. Putting them in school with us will only hurt them in the end. ANTONIO
PAYNE Coolidge

I wouldn't be willing to accept a new classmate who has AIDS under any terms
because tests haven't proven that AIDS cannot be transmitted by casual contact.
Doctors know very little about this deadly virus. It would be too risky for
other classmates, both medically and psychologically.

I ask myself, "Can AIDS be absorbed through an individual's skin, causing him to
contract AIDS?" How can a student bear knowing that his classmate is terminally
ill? I think that knowing a classmate is near death with an illness would have
the same effect as hearing that a classmate has committed suicide or been killed
in some terrible misfortune.

We socialize, study and enjoy many other things in life with our classmates. Can
we really cope with a person sick with AIDS in the classroom? JEANETTE HOWARD
Wilson

I learned a great deal about the AIDS virus while working on an AIDS research
project at Children's Hospital over the summer. After holding test tubes of AIDS
-infected blood serum in my well-gloved hands, having a student with AIDS at my
school would be no major threat to me. I believe that most people with AIDS are
just as afraid of spreading the disease as people are afraid of them.

A lack of education about the AIDS virus is the creator of the fears which cause
AIDS victims to become outcasts. I would welcome a student with AIDS at my
school. Her presence and eventual demise would be harsh and painful for my
fellow classmates. However, from this, a school community would learn the facts
about AIDS, and most importantly, learn how to prevent the disease. TERESA
WILLIAMS Georgetown Visitation

I would not under any circumstances be willing to accept a person with AIDS as a
classmate. I don't think that researchers, doctors or school administrators know
enough about the virus to take any chances.

I don't think a school full of children or administrators would be comfortable
around an AIDS victim. Even though researchers say we cannot catch the virus by
casual contact, it does not erase the fears that people have about AIDS.

I don't think I'm discriminating against people with AIDS, I just think they
should have schools, residential areas and an isolated hospital for AIDS
victims.

I think public and private school officials would agree that they wouldn't want
their child in a school with an AIDS victim.  ASAHKI JONES Ballou

Higher People's Court Hebei: Opinions on Strengthening National Compensation
Legal Aid

LENGTH: 1475  words


Beijing, Jan. 27 -- The PLA Military Court, the General Political Department of
Justice Bureau of Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps Higher People's
Court Branch of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, Bureau of
Justice:

In order to further standardize and promote the people's courts handle legal aid
work state compensation cases, the Supreme People's Court, the Ministry of
Justice to develop a "national compensation on strengthening legal aid advice."
Is issued to you, please follow.



Supreme People's Justice Department

January 2, 2014

Poor people exercise state compensation law for the effective protection of the
right to request, regulate and promote the people's courts handle legal aid work
state compensation cases, combined with the actual legal aid work, made the
following comments on the strengthening of national legal aid compensation
related work:

First, the importance of improving the work of the State Compensation legal aid
understanding.

State law to apply for compensation for poor people to provide legal aid
services is an important function of legal aid work. In the state compensation
cases handled by the People's Court, the application for state compensation are
mostly vulnerable citizens, caught in the economic difficulties and a lack of
legal knowledge double dilemma, in dire need of legal assistance. Strengthen
national compensation for legal aid work to protect poor people exercise state
law claims for compensation is an important aspect to adapt to people's growing
demand justice, strengthening the legal aid services to protect and improve
people's livelihood and work under the new situation, to achieve social fairness
and justice, to promote social harmony and stability is important. People's
courts and judicial administrative organs at all levels should fully understand
the importance of strengthening national compensation legal aid work, firmly
establish the mass viewpoint, seriously practice the mass line, further
innovation and improve the working mechanism, and constantly improve the ability
and level of state compensation for legal aid work efforts to make poor people
feel justice in every state compensation cases.

Second, to ensure that poor people eligible for legal aid in a timely manner to
get state compensation.

People's courts and judicial administrative organs should take the conditions
published in various forms of state compensation for legal aid programs,
compensation claimant's rights and obligations, so that the public understand
the State Compensation Legal Aid knowledge to guide the economic difficulties of
the claimant for compensation to apply for legal aid. People's court shall
inform the applicant at the time of filing for state compensation in writing to
the citizens, if the economic difficulties may apply for legal location of the
organ liable for compensation for legal aid agencies aid. Legal aid agencies
should give full play to the role of grassroots legal aid work site consulting
answer, transfer and other aspects of the application, smooth "12348" legal
service hotline; conditional place to set up legal aid station in the People's
Court, the legal aid applications to broaden channels for easy Citizens seeking
state compensation for legal aid. Legal aid agencies to state compensation law
to apply for assistance from citizens, to conduct the review in accordance with
law, within the statutory time limit as much as possible to shorten the time and
improve efficiency; custody of innocent citizens apply for state compensation,
the People's Court confirmed that it has no source of income can be identified
in line with the economic difficulties the claimant for compensation standards;
applying for legal matters with an emergency or exceptional circumstances, legal
aid agencies may first be given legal aid, and afterwards go through the
relevant formalities.

Third, increase job security for state compensation for legal aid efforts.

Acting state compensation to the People's Court legal aid cases to facilitate
legal aid personnel, aid workers to apply to court for legal investigation and
evidence collection, and should be actively supported by law; copying fees for
legal aid personnel related materials, should be exempt. People's courts handle
state compensation cases, to fully listen to the views of legal aid personnel,
and for the record; People's Court decided to apply for state compensation cases
to make the book, judgments and legal instruments such ruling shall set forth
the name of the legal aid agencies, legal aid workers name and affiliation and
so on. Judicial and administrative authorities to adopt comprehensive enhance
social recognition, improve the incentive mechanism of recognition, allowances
and other methods to improve the handling, transfer of legal aid staff for state
compensation legal aid cases enthusiasm needed to coordinate with the relevant
authorities, units, increase the handling of the case job support. People's
courts and legal aid agencies to strengthen the coordination, to determine or
replace legal aid personnel, change the time to listen, to terminate legal aid
in a timely manner to communicate with each other informed of the progress of
cases handled. People's Court and the judicial and administrative authorities to
establish joint conference system for the regular exchange of work carried out
to ensure the smooth convergence related work.

Fourth, improve the quality of state compensation and the effect of legal aid
work

Legal aid agencies to improve the assignment of cases, according to the type of
state compensation cases, comprehensive legal aid staff expertise, and
willingness to compensate the claimant characteristics and other factors to
determine reasonable contractors and personnel to implement the point system of
conditional aid place to ensure effective handling quality; should guide the
legal aid staff do a good job meeting, marking, investigation, trial or
participate in cross-examination and other work, according to the laws and
regulations and relevant case, the provision of legal services starting from
standard maintenance claimant for compensation benefits, facilitate the
resolution of their legal and reasonable request for compensation. The judge and
legal aid personnel should pay attention to the process of handling cases
eliminating confusion release do work to help people correctly understand the
request for compensation in cases involving policies and regulations to promote
the claimant for compensation service contracting interest appeal. Judicial and
administrative authorities and the legal aid agencies to enhance the quality of
case management, improve the quality of supervision and management mechanism for
handling compensation cases in accordance with national characteristics, the
integrated use of case quality assessment, inspection and assessment files,
conduct quality control visits claimant for compensation, etc., focus on
strengthening the major difficult complex cases handled by tracking supervision,
promote the improvement of quality of case handling. People's Court found that
there are illegal or legal aid staff damages the interests of the request, to
promptly informed of the situation to the legal aid agencies, supervise legal
aid personnel handled the case according to the law.

Fifth, innovative state compensation mechanism extends legal aid effectiveness.

People's courts and legal aid agencies working to establish a dispute resolution
mechanism to guide the choice of legal aid workers compensation claimant most
beneficial way to resolve the dispute, the case is simple, the facts are clear,
the controversy is not the case, according to the claimant for compensation

The waning of AIDS activism  The victories of AIDS activists in the past have
paved the way for a new generation with far greater influence -- but these
political and personal associations have their perils

DATELINE: Toronto


On Canada Day, Canadian AIDS activists in Geneva for the 12th World AIDS
Conference held a demonstration at the Health Canada exhibition booth. Their
complaint was legitimate: Federal officials have been slow to approve new AIDS
drugs, lagging far behind American regulatory authorities.

The protest lacked the passion and urgency of earlier years. Then, people with
AIDS, literally fighting for their lives, shook the foundations of the medical
research and health-care delivery systems in Canada. The first wave of AIDS
protesters successfully waged battles over placebo controlled research trials,
denial of access to experimental medications and intrusive public-health
measures. Many of that first cohort of activists never survived to benefit from
new therapies.

The victories of AIDS activism in the past have paved the way for a new
generation of activists with far greater influence. Representatives of the
HIV-infected community have been appointed to provincial and national government
committees, to scientific review panels and to pharmaceutical-industry advisory
groups. Some AIDS activists are now employed by AIDS service organizations
funded by government and industry. The advantages of such close relationships
are secure funding for Canada's National AIDS Strategy, a say over the
distribution of research funds and industry-supported travel grants for AIDS
activists attending scientific conferences.

The perils of these political and personal associations are less evident. AIDS
activists did not hit the streets when federal transfer payments to the
provinces were being reduced. Provincial governments responded by cutting health
and social services to people with AIDS and to many others. AIDS activists have
been virtually silent about government's failure to provide services to
injection drug users, which until recently has left addicts without effective
advocacy. Drug users, who now account for one-third of new HIV infections in
Canada, have not been the beneficiaries of gala fund-raising events. Nor have
active drug users been appointed to the boards of directors of AIDS service
organizations.

The Canadian pharmaceutical industry has been largely spared from scrutiny and
accountability over its pricing of AIDS drugs. AIDS activists and organizations,
dependent on the support of drug companies, are in too vulnerable a position to
take on the marketing policies of their benefactors.

AIDS activists have correctly called for the inclusion of more women in
industry-sponsored AIDS clinical trials. HIV-infected persons who are poor,
homeless, mentally ill or addicted still remain underrepresented in AIDS
research. They do not met the rigorous standards for participation in clinical
trials. Positive research results with highly motivated subjects do not hold for
those disconnected from society. Again, AIDS activists have been quiet.
Marginalized persons with HIV do not fit into mainstream AIDS activism.

The legitimacy of the Canadians' Geneva protest did not lessen the triviality of
the event. Internationally, AIDS activism has never achieved the influence it
has attained in North America. Access to the standard AIDS therapies is a
fantasy for the 90 per cent of HIV-infected persons worldwide who live in poor
countries. Third World delegates at the conference sat in stony silence
listening to the most recent AIDS treatment advances which will help only the 10
per cent living in wealthy nations. Basic health care, adequate nutrition and
clean water supplies preoccupy the health-care providers in developing
countries.

The theme of the World AIDS Conference -- "Bridging the Gap" -- rings hollow as
the gulf deepens between rich and poor countries. In Geneva, no protests were
organized to criticize a world economy that fails to provide basic necessities
of life, including to those with HIV, in impoverished countries. No Canadian
AIDS activists expressed their solidarity with their AIDS co-sufferers wasting
away in far-off lands.

The battle against AIDS has changed over the years. In Canada it now means
confronting addiction and poverty. Internationally it means working with
development agencies and peers in poor countries to promote the establishment of
a health-care and social infrastructure.

Some long-standing AIDS activists are beginning to express their concerns about
the direction of the AIDS movement. Canadian AIDS activists must develop a
political analysis that takes into account socio-economic differences at home
and Canada's role in Third World countries. They must also lessen their
dependence on the pharmaceutical industry. Unless AIDS activists shift their
focus to accommodate the changing world of AIDS, AIDS activism will become a
spent force.

epidemic began.

It took some time to convince Ernest Norsworthy Jr. that he needed a hearing aid
. So when he eventually decided to purchase one, he didn't want any old hearing
aid. He didn't want to be like his friends, who had tried them before and hated
them.

"I wasn't ready to join that crowd," he said.

Norsworthy didn't have anything to worry about. Today's hearing aid market is
vast compared to even a decade ago. Within the last few years, hearing aids have
made technological strides, becoming smaller and more complex than ever. The
industry, with more than 35 manufacturers, sells nearly 1.7 million hearing aids
a year.

"If you've tried hearing aids in the past and they were unsuccessful, you should
consider trying them again because new technology has made a significant
difference," said Laura Dennison, an audiologist and the vice chairwoman of the
Georgia State Board of Hearing Aid Dealers and Dispensers.  The 28 million
Americans who have some degree of hearing loss have a bundle of products to
chose from. Hearing aids, miniature amplification systems equipped with a
microphone, amplifier, receiver and speaker and battery, can help even the
hardest of hearing, but consumers must pay attention to their own tastes and
needs to select the right one.

"It's a much bigger ballpark and it gets confusing to inform everyone about
what's available," Dennison said. "There's so much more available now than five
years ago."

The most apparent change is the shrinking size of the hearing aid. Large, bulky
instruments are reserved for extreme hearing loss problems. Today, hearing aids
come in such small sizes that they're nearly undetectable. Smaller than the
diameter of a dime, the tiniest hearing aids can be slipped completely into the
canal of the ear.

The smaller sizes are a cosmetic boon for those who don't want to advertise
their hearing problems. Smaller hearing aids also have the advantage of reducing
the whistling sound that hearing aids can make when they come in close contact
with another person or a telephone.

Smaller hearing aids have their disadvantages, too. Many of the smaller hearing
aids have less power and are most beneficial for those with mild to moderate
hearing losses. Those who opt for the smaller hearing aids, especially the ones
that go in the canal or completely in the canal of the ear, must adjust to
having something lodged into the ear and must learn how to manipulate it,
sometimes even using a remote control.

But technology has provided more than just a size issue. The way hearing aids
process sounds changed dramatically several years ago, when manufacturers began
offering programmable hearing aids.

Instead of amplifying all sounds, the way traditional analog hearing aids do,
audiologists can adjust the programmable hearing aids to reduce loud, harsh
sounds while amplifying soft sounds.

Then, within the last three years, manufacturers developed the digital hearing
aid, which processes sounds digitally like a CD.

Widex, a hearing aid manufacturer, became the first company to offer a digital
in-the-ear hearing aid in 1996 and the first to offer a digital,
completely-in-the-canal hearing aid in 1997. Now other hearing aid
manufacturers, such as Oticon and Bernafon, have produced their own line of
digital aids.

With the advent of digital technology, sounds are more fine-tuned and less
distorted. The digital hearing aid can filter sounds and, in the process,
suppress certain unwanted sounds. Also programmed by a computer in the
audiologist's office, the digital hearing aid can adjust to the environment a
person is in. For instance, in a setting like a restaurant, the hearing aid
turns down background noise while still amplifying the conversation.

Norsworthy, after researching on the Internet and attending a workshop, chose a
digital behind-the-ear hearing aid.

"I was impressed because I like computers and this is like a computer in the
ear," said the 68-year-old Marietta resident.

Norsworthy made a serious investment. Some, but not all, insurance companies pay
for hearing aids or hearing tests. Norsworthy paid for his own. His set of two
digital hearing aids cost him $ 4,600, with a two-year warranty. In Atlanta,
audiologists charge $ 4,600 to $ 6,000 for a set of digital hearing aids,
depending on size, with smaller ones usually costing more. A set of programmable
hearing aids costs $ 3,000 to $ 5,000, while analog aids are generally the
cheapest, $ 1,700 to $ 3,000 for a set of two.

"It's a big commitment to buy these, but it's something that improves the
quality of life. It's better than a piece of jewelry or vacation," said Carol
Fisher, a Dunwoody homemaker in her early 50s.

Mail-order hearing aids --- often advertised as a sound amplifier, rather than
an aid --- can cost less than $ 400 for a set, but are not recommended by
audiologists because most people must work with a hearing aid specialist to
determine their level of hearing loss and an appropriate hearing aid.

Some audiologists, including Dennison, said the digital hearing aid, despite its
technology, is not worth the extra investment. Some programmable hearing aids
often can do a similar job for a lower price, she said. Other hearing
specialists beg to differ.

Kadyn Williams, an audiologist and co-director of Audiological Consultants of
Atlanta, warned that consumers must be wary. "Not all programmable hearing aids
are equal," she said.

Fisher, one of her patients, first had a programmable in-the-canal hearing aid.
Two years later, Fisher said, she tried a digital, completely-in-the-canal
digital hearing aid and found that it controlled sound better --- and, most
importantly, the clarity improved.

Still, hearing aids do not fix hearing loss problems. They simply amplify
sounds.

"You may not hear like when you were 16, but it has nothing to do with the aid.
It's what the ear is doing to the signal," Dennison said. "(Hearing aids) are
not perfect by any means. You need to keep in mind that it is still an aid. It
is not a cure."

 HELP AVAILABLE IN DIFFERENT PACKAGES
 Hearing aids come in many shapes, sizes, colors and models, but they
 generally fall into four basic designs. In each category, models that
 use analog technology generally cost less than those that are digital.
 Type........... Cost..........Advantages.....
 Behind the ear..$ 1,500-$ 4,800..Most powerful, more comfortable

Focus on clients, not technology

SECTION: ADVERTISING; SUPPLEMENT; Pg. 38; ADVERTISING SUPPLEMENT HEARING AID &
AUDIOLOGY CLINIC

LENGTH: 587 words


Every person with a hearing problem is treated as an individual by the team of
professional clinicians at the Hearing Aid and Audiology Clinic.

Audiologists Brian Conaghan and Jeanine Doherty, and audiometrist Sandra Knight,
who have combined experience of 49 years, say that each person is a unique case
requiring specific individual attention, and often the most appropriate aid is
not the most expensive or latest technology.

They say that less-expensive hearing aids are adequate. "We often see
advertisements for the very latest and usually the most expensive hearing aids,"
Mr Conaghan says.

It is the role of an audiologist to give each person advice on a variety of
hearing-aid choices based on the degree and type of hearing loss, as well as the
different social interactions, and hearing problems that the person faces in
their daily life.

"The most expensive or latest- technology hearing aid is not necessarily the
best or appropriate choice," he says. "A person who needs a hearing aid mainly
for enjoying television and for communicating with relatives at home does not
require the most sophisticated hearing aid."

Mr Conaghan believes that many advertisements for high-tech hearing aids are
misleading, and give people unrealistic expectations about an aid's capability.

"It is incumbent on the audiologist to give the client realistic expectations
well before the trial of any hearing aid," he says.

As audiologists, the clinicians at the Hearing Aid and Audiology Clinic are
trained to focus on the client's particular requirements.

"We focus as much expert attention on the evaluation, hearing- aid fitting, and
rehabilitation as on the actual technology of the hearing aid," Mr Conaghan
says.

"It is the person who is the focus, not the technology of the aid."

People need to know what it will be like to wear a hearing aid, he says. With a
hearing aid fitted, people hear some sounds they have not heard before, or which
they have not heard for a long time. "Their own voice will sound louder, and
they will need to learn to tune out background noises.

"It can take several weeks to adjust to a hearing aid."

A hearing aid should help a person to hear, but will not perform in all
situations, he says.

"Most hearing-aid users would agree that while they wouldn't want to be without
their hearing aid, a hearing aid is no substitute for an ear," Mr Conaghan says.

The clinic offers a wide selection of hearing aids, including discreet hearing
aids, hearing aids what fit inside the ear, aids that sit behind the ear, and
remote-control and automatic hearing aids which incorporate the most
sophisticated hearing-aid technology.

All clients have a free trial period of about three weeks, in which they can
evaluate the hearing aid's performance for themselves. If the hearing aid is
deemed by the client to be unsuitable, it can be returned at no cost.

.

Video otoscope

The clinic has recently bought a video otoscope, which is a valuable teaching
tool to show patients and their families a colour video picture of the ear
canal.

Mr Conaghan says the otoscope is also used to alert the audiologist to
significant wax accumulation, and is an essential piece of equipment for some
specialised hearing aid fittings and for taking accurate and safe impressions.

Text of report by official Chinese news agency Xinhua (New China News Agency)

["Full text" of PRC Premier Wen Jiabao's speech at discussion panel on UN
Millennium Development Goals plus HIV/AIDS in New York on 22 September]

United Nations, 22 Sep (Xinhua) -Premier Wen Jiabao of China's State Council
delivered a speech at a discussion panel on the UN Millennium Development Goals
[MDGs] plus HIV/AIDS on the 22nd. The following is the full text of the speech:

Speech at the discussion panel on the UN MDGs plus HIV/AIDS

By Wen Jiabao, premier of the PRC State Council

(22 September 2010, New York)

Honourable Executive Director Mr Michel Sidibe,

Ladies and gentlemen:

I am very glad to have the opportunity to attend this discussion panel on the
sidelines of the UN High-Level Meeting on the MDGs. I believe that it is
necessary for the international community to jointly study some long-term and
strategic issues concerning the survival and development of mankind. At the same
time, it has a responsibility to pay attention to and confront the real
suffering of mankind and to save those disease-ravaged people who are struggling
in pain.

HIV/AIDS is a common challenge for mankind. Since it was discovered for the
first time in 1981, this disease has taken 25 million lives. The 2000 UN
Millennium Summit called for "halting and reversing the spread of HIV/AIDS by
2015." The decision, filled with the love and care of the world as it is, has
given hope to regions threatened by HIV/AIDS and to hundreds of thousands of
HIV/AIDS patients. Ten years have passed. It is heartening to see considerable
progress made in HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment thanks to joint efforts by
the international community. The number of HIV carriers who have received
treatment and financial assistance has increased significantly, and the numbers
of new infections and deaths are declining. However, there are still more than
30 million HIV/AIDS patients worldwide, with the sub-Sahara African region alone
accounting for more than 20 million. Tens of millions of lives are still
enduring the ravages of disease and struggling on the verge of death, waiting to
be helped and rescued by us. We cannot turn a deaf ear to their calls of life,
and we cannot be slow in coming to their aid. We must give a strong push to
global HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment and ensure that the MDGs in the HIV/
AIDS field are met on schedule.

I have visited HIV/AIDS patients in communities, rural areas, and hospitals
every year since I took office as premier in 2003. I have even specially invited
orphans who have lost their parents to AIDS as well as children with HIV/AIDS to
my office at Zhongnanhai. Each time I see a person afflicted by HIV/AIDS or an
elderly person or a child who has lost loved ones to AIDS, and each time I walk
into their homes and hold their hands in mine, I feel deep in my heart a sense
of responsibility that makes me believe that the government should do more on
their behalf.

My deepest impression from my contact with HIV/AIDS patients is that they have
to endure not only the ravages of disease but also tremendous pressure in
society. Ignorance and discrimination are sometimes worse than the disease
itself. Wenlou Village in Shangcai County in the central Chinese province of
Henan is a place in China where HIV/AIDS is quite serious. Villagers have told
me that they cannot sell locally produced grain and vegetables even though the
quality is good, because no one dares to buy them. Migrant workers from the
village face discrimination, as do children at school. A 16-year-old girl called
Nannan has lost both parents to AIDS, and she herself is infected with HIV
through mother-to-child transmission. She told me, "What makes me feel awful is
that my schoolmates would not hang out with me." I couldn't express my feelings
of sadness in words after hearing her. Imagine ourselves in their shoes. How
would we feel if we were the patients in such an environment? In this sense,
disseminating HIV/AIDS knowledge, taking a correct view of HIV/AIDS, and
reducing discrimination against HIV/AIDS are as important as HIV/AIDS prevention
and treatment. I greatly admire the saying in U ganda: "We are fighting HIV/
AIDS, not HIV/AIDS patients."

Love is a great medicine for relieving the pain of HIV/AIDS patients. We have
not yet found an effective cure for HIV/AIDS, but there is no lack of love in
this world. Everyone is an inexhaustible source of love. With a compassionate
heart, each of us can show a bit of love for HIV/AID patients. They actually do
not expect too much from us. They only hope that other people are a bit
friendlier and more loving towards them -perhaps by giving them a hug or
chatting with them for a few minutes. Even a handshake or a smile will let them
see a chance of survival in the wilderness of life. Showing care and love for
other people is a blessing. There are many volunteers in China who care for,
love, and help HIV/AID patients. A professor called Gui Xi'en at Wuhan
University is a friend of mine. He is over 70 years old. For decades, he has
been helping HIV/AIDS patients with his own money. He has invited patients to
live in his house. In my view, showing care and love for HIV/AIDS patients does
not mean holding forth about the issue of HIV/AIDS on a podium in a metropolis.
Care and love must be real and concrete, embodied and practiced by each family
and each individual. We should walk among HIV/AIDS patients, hold their hands,
listen to what they say face-to-face, and earnestly solve problems of real
concern to them. I hope that everyone in the whole society pays close attention
to the issue of HIV/AIDS and shows care and love for HIV/AIDS patients.

The Chinese Government attaches great importance to HIV/AIDS prevention and
treatment. We began waging a campaign against HIV/AIDS when we detected the
first HIV infection in 1985. This is a daunting and protracted campaign, but we
have never flinched in fear. We set up an HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment
committee in 2004, thereby forming a government-led prevention and treatment
mechanism featuring joint participation by the whole society. We successfully
drew up medium-and long-term plans for HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment and two
five-year action plans. We also unveiled regulations on HIV/AIDS prevention and
treatment in 2006. This provides strong legal and policy safeguards for HIV/AIDS
prevention and treatment. We have constantly increased financial inputs, with
funds allocated by the central government for HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment
rising from 100 million yuan in 2001 to 1.6 billion yuan this year. Matching
funds by local governments have also increased each year. We implement measures
for showing care and love nationwide featuring "four free services and one act
of compassion." We provide free antiretroviral drugs to HIV/AIDS patients among
rural residents and from low-income urban households, offer free consultation
and tests to those who voluntarily undergo tests, cut off mother-to-child
transmission free of charge for HIV-infected pregnant women, provide free
schooling to AIDS orphans, and show compassion for HIV/AID patients and their
families by providing medical treatment and financial aid. We have vigorously
stepped up efforts to provide public information and education about HIV/AIDS
and disseminated knowledge about HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment, so that the
whole society will correctly approach HIV/AIDS and HIV/AIDS patients, show less
discrimination, and adopt a civilized and healthy lifestyle. We have cracked
down hard on illegal blood transfusions, stepped up efforts to build and manage
blood collection stations, taken credible steps to step up epidemic monitoring
and testing, carried out more effective screening for HIV/AIDS, actively
implemented interventionist measures, cut off drug abuse and other primary HIV/
AIDS transmission routes, and effectively prevented and controlled the
transmission and spread of epidemics. We practice a management method that
combines medical service with community service and aid by society with
compassion in the family to help HIV/AIDS patients receive antiretroviral
treatment, create conditions for them to live and work normally, make proper
arrangements for AIDS orphans, and safeguard their rights and interests.

The rapid spread of HIV/AIDS in China has been basically brought under control.
The mortality rate has declined noticeably, and the quality of life for infected
persons and patients has improved markedly. We are confident of achieving the
MDGs in the arena of HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment by 2015.

Ladies and gentlemen:

It is the common responsibility of all mankind to fight HIV/AIDS. Mankind needs
to unite to protect itself because there is so much suffering in this world. The
international community should display the spirit of helping each other and
pulling together during difficult times and further increase cooperation in the
field of HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment.

- Developed countries should honour in good faith their commitments and provide
necessary financial and technical assistance to developing countries.

-  Developing countries should actively draw upon experiences in the
international community that have proved to be effective and keep exploring ways
of preventing and treating HIV/AIDS that fit their national conditions.

- The World Health Organization; the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS;
the Global Fund To Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria; and other
international institutions should step up coordination, mobilize resources from
multiple sources, and make good use of their professional expertise to help
developing countries, sub-Saharan African countries in particular, improve HIV/
AIDS prevention and treatment.

- The international community should increase cooperation in HIV/AIDS-related
scientific research and key projects, step up efforts to research and develop
HIV vaccines and antiretroviral drugs, and further improve treatment plans.

- Medical institutions and pharmaceutical companies around the world should
earnestly assume their social responsibilities, try to bring down the cost of
HIV/AIDS treatment and drugs, and appropriately loosen intellectual property
rights protection for HIV/AIDS drugs and medical technologies, so that HIV/AIDS
patients throughout the world can gain access to affordable, convenient, and
effective treatment.

China has been actively participating in international cooperation in HIV/AIDS
prevention and treatment. It has donated money to the global fund for many years
in a row, actively trained HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment personnel for
Africa, and carried out cooperation with the Mekong Subregion and ASEAN
countries in launching HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment projects. China will
donate $14 million to the global fund over the next three years. China will
continue to deepen its participation in international cooperation and make
contributions to achieving the MDGs in the HIV/AIDS arena on schedule around the
globe.

Ladies and gentlemen:

Here I cannot help thinking of a 12-year-old boy from Anhui's Fuyang among the
children that I invited to Zhongnanhai three years ago. He lost both parents to
AIDS, leaving him to live with his elderly grandmother. When I asked him what he
wanted to say to me, he said: "I want to be a doctor when I grow up. I want to
build a world that no longer has HIV/AIDS, a world where no children will lose
their parents to AIDS. Those were but simple words from an innocent child, yet
they spoke to the best of humanity. They were the calls of life, of conscience,
and of hope. The history of mankind is a history of fights against various
diseases and of victories in those fights. "Each disaster that befalls mankind
is compensated with the progress of history." Over the course of several
centuries, we have managed to defeat smallpox, the plague, and various other
diseases that have brought enormous disasters to mankind. This has increased our
wisdom and faith in survival and made us value our lives even more and take
better care of ourselves. I firmly believe that the "red ribbon" [symbol of
support for HIV/AIDS patients] will closely link our hearts together. There will
come a day when mankind will ultimately defeat HIV/AIDS and when smiles of hope,
not tears of despair, will appear on the faces of those unfortunate to be
infected with the HIV virus. Let us work even harder for the early arrival of
that day!

Thank you!

progress made in HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment thanks to joint efforts by
the international community. The number of HIV carriers who have received
treatment and financial assistance has increased significantly, and the numbers
of new infections and deaths are declining. However, there are still more than
30 million HIV/AIDS patients worldwide, with the sub-Sahara African region alone
accounting for more than 20 million. Tens of millions of lives are still
enduring the ravages of disease and struggling on the verge of death, waiting to
be helped and rescued by us. We cannot turn a deaf ear to their calls of life,
and we cannot be slow in coming to their aid. We must give a strong push to
global HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment and ensure that the MDGs in the HIV/
AIDS field are met on schedule.

I have visited HIV/AIDS patients in communities, rural areas, and hospitals
every year since I took office as premier in 2003. I have even specially invited
orphans who have lost their parents to AIDS as well as children with HIV/AIDS to
my office at Zhongnanhai. Each time I see a person afflicted by HIV/AIDS or an
elderly person or a child who has lost loved ones to AIDS, and each time I walk
into their homes and hold their hands in mine, I feel deep in my heart a sense
of responsibility that makes me believe that the government should do more on
their behalf.

My deepest impression from my contact with HIV/AIDS patients is that they have
to endure not only the ravages of disease but also tremendous pressure in
society. Ignorance and discrimination are sometimes worse than the disease
itself. Wenlou Village in Shangcai County in the central Chinese province of
Henan is a place in China where HIV/AIDS is quite serious. Villagers have told
me that they cannot sell locally produced grain and vegetables even though the
quality is good, because no one dares to buy them. Migrant workers from the
village face discrimination, as do children at school. A 16-year-old girl called
Nannan has lost both parents to AIDS, and she herself is infected with HIV
through mother-to-child transmission. She told me, "What makes me feel awful is
that my schoolmates would not hang out with me." I couldn't express my feelings
of sadness in words after hearing her. Imagine ourselves in their shoes. How
would we feel if we were the patients in such an environment? In this sense,
disseminating HIV/AIDS knowledge, taking a correct view of HIV/AIDS, and
reducing discrimination against HIV/AIDS are as important as HIV/AIDS prevention
and treatment. I greatly admire the saying in U ganda: "We are fighting HIV/
AIDS, not HIV/AIDS patients."

Love is a great medicine for relieving the pain of HIV/AIDS patients. We have
not yet found an effective cure for HIV/AIDS, but there is no lack of love in
this world. Everyone is an inexhaustible source of love. With a compassionate
heart, each of us can show a bit of love for HIV/AID patients. They actually do
not expect too much from us. They only hope that other people are a bit
friendlier and more loving towards them -perhaps by giving them a hug or
chatting with them for a few minutes. Even a handshake or a smile will let them
see a chance of survival in the wilderness of life. Showing care and love for
other people is a blessing. There are many volunteers in China who care for,
love, and help HIV/AID patients. A professor called Gui Xi'en at Wuhan
University is a friend of mine. He is over 70 years old. For decades, he has
been helping HIV/AIDS patients with his own money. He has invited patients to
live in his house. In my view, showing care and love for HIV/AIDS patients does
not mean holding forth about the issue of HIV/AIDS on a podium in a metropolis.
Care and love must be real and concrete, embodied and practiced by each family
and each individual. We should walk among HIV/AIDS patients, hold their hands,
listen to what they say face-to-face, and earnestly solve problems of real
concern to them. I hope that everyone in the whole society pays close attention
to the issue of HIV/AIDS and shows care and love for HIV/AIDS patients.

The Chinese Government attaches great importance to HIV/AIDS prevention and
treatment. We began waging a campaign against HIV/AIDS when we detected the
first HIV infection in 1985. This is a daunting and protracted campaign, but we
have never flinched in fear. We set up an HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment
committee in 2004, thereby forming a government-led prevention and treatment
mechanism featuring joint participation by the whole society. We successfully
drew up medium-and long-term plans for HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment and two
five-year action plans. We also unveiled regulations on HIV/AIDS prevention and
treatment in 2006. This provides strong legal and policy safeguards for HIV/AIDS
prevention and treatment. We have constantly increased financial inputs, with
funds allocated by the central government for HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment
rising from 100 million yuan in 2001 to 1.6 billion yuan this year. Matching
funds by local governments have also increased each year. We implement measures
for showing care and love nationwide featuring "four free services and one act
of compassion." We provide free antiretroviral drugs to HIV/AIDS patients among
rural residents and from low-income urban households, offer free consultation
and tests to those who voluntarily undergo tests, cut off mother-to-child
transmission free of charge for HIV-infected pregnant women, provide free
schooling to AIDS orphans, and show compassion for HIV/AID patients and their
families by providing medical treatment and financial aid. We have vigorously
stepped up efforts to provide public information and education about HIV/AIDS
and disseminated knowledge about HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment, so that the
whole society will correctly approach HIV/AIDS and HIV/AIDS patients, show less
discrimination, and adopt a civilized and healthy lifestyle. We have cracked
down hard on illegal blood transfusions, stepped up efforts to build and manage
blood collection stations, taken credible steps to step up epidemic monitoring
and testing, carried out more effective screening for HIV/AIDS, actively
implemented interventionist measures, cut off drug abuse and other primary HIV/
AIDS transmission routes, and effectively prevented and controlled the
transmission and spread of epidemics. We practice a management method that
combines medical service with community service and aid by society with
compassion in the family to help HIV/AIDS patients receive antiretroviral
treatment, create conditions for them to live and work normally, make proper
arrangements for AIDS orphans, and safeguard their rights and interests.

The rapid spread of HIV/AIDS in China has been basically brought under control.
The mortality rate has declined noticeably, and the quality of life for infected
persons and patients has improved markedly. We are confident of achieving the
MDGs in the arena of HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment by 2015.

Ladies and gentlemen:

It is the common responsibility of all mankind to fight HIV/AIDS. Mankind needs
to unite to protect itself because there is so much suffering in this world. The
international community should display the spirit of helping each other and
pulling together during difficult times and further increase cooperation in the
field of HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment.

- Developed countries should honour in good faith their commitments and provide
necessary financial and technical assistance to developing countries.

-  Developing countries should actively draw upon experiences in the
international community that have proved to be effective and keep exploring ways
of preventing and treating HIV/AIDS that fit their national conditions.

- The World Health Organization; the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS;
the Global Fund To Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria; and other
international institutions should step up coordination, mobilize resources from
multiple sources, and make good use of their professional expertise to help
developing countries, sub-Saharan African countries in particular, improve HIV/
AIDS prevention and treatment.

- The international community should increase cooperation in HIV/AIDS-related
scientific research and key projects, step up efforts to research and develop
HIV vaccines and antiretroviral drugs, and further improve treatment plans.

- Medical institutions and pharmaceutical companies around the world should
earnestly assume their social responsibilities, try to bring down the cost of
HIV/AIDS treatment and drugs, and appropriately loosen intellectual property
rights protection for HIV/AIDS drugs and medical technologies, so that HIV/AIDS
patients throughout the world can gain access to affordable, convenient, and
effective treatment.

China has been actively participating in international cooperation in HIV/AIDS
prevention and treatment. It has donated money to the global fund for many years
in a row, actively trained HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment personnel for
Africa, and carried out cooperation with the Mekong Subregion and ASEAN
countries in launching HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment projects. China will
donate $14 million to the global fund over the next three years. China will
continue to deepen its participation in international cooperation and make
contributions to achieving the MDGs in the HIV/AIDS arena on schedule around the
globe.

Ladies and gentlemen:

Here I cannot help thinking of a 12-year-old boy from Anhui's Fuyang among the
children that I invited to Zhongnanhai three years ago. He lost both parents to
AIDS, leaving him to live with his elderly grandmother. When I asked him what he
wanted to say to me, he said: "I want to be a doctor when I grow up. I want to
build a world that no longer has HIV/AIDS, a world where no children will lose
their parents to AIDS. Those were but simple words from an innocent child, yet
they spoke to the best of humanity. They were the calls of life, of conscience,
and of hope. The history of mankind is a history of fights against various
diseases and of victories in those fights. "Each disaster that befalls mankind
is compensated with the progress of history." Over the course of several
centuries, we have managed to defeat smallpox, the plague, and various other
diseases that have brought enormous disasters to mankind. This has increased our
wisdom and faith in survival and made us value our lives even more and take
better care of ourselves. I firmly believe that the "red ribbon" [symbol of
support for HIV/AIDS patients] will closely link our hearts together. There will
come a day when mankind will ultimately defeat HIV/AIDS and when smiles of hope,
not tears of despair, will appear on the faces of those unfortunate to be
infected with the HIV virus. Let us work even harder for the early arrival of
that day!

Thank you!

A fresh narrative on aid dependence

BYLINE: Jonathan Glennieguardian.co.uk

LENGTH: 868 words

ABSTRACT

Strong growth and greater autonomy are making poor countries less aid reliant,
claims a report that offers the development community a fresh take on a
traditionally discomfiting issue

FULL TEXT

ActionAid has  celebrating the fact that poor countries are relying less and
less on aid. The number of low income countries (LICs) receiving aid equivalent
to 30% of government expenditure or more has reduced from 42 to 30 in the past
decade.

In Zambia, for instance, aid has fallen from 84% of government expenditure to
just 44%. That doesn't mean Zambia is receiving less aid in absolute terms - it
means more money is coming in from elsewhere, making aid a less important part
of the mix. In fact,  notes the apparent paradox that while aid giving has
increased globally, aid dependence has reduced because of strong economic
growth.

Growth is the major factor at work, but it is linked to another positive
development strongly emphasised in the ActionAid report: a new-found
determination among poor countries to end 30 or more years of heavy aid
dependence that has seldom delivered the kind of development for which they had
hoped.

Some of the poorest countries in the world - Afghanistan, Cambodia, Ghana,
Liberia, Nepal, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Uganda and Vietnam - have set reducing aid
dependence as a key medium-term goal in their national development or aid
-management policies.

Ghana's new aid policy says: "The government of Ghana has taken cognizance of
the need to reduce dependence on aid in the medium to long-term, and therefore
intends to redouble its efforts at mobilising non-aid resources to fund its
development objectives."

Recognising the difficulty of reducing aid dependence, and the need to engage
complementary policies, the government of Uganda (which is still as aid
dependent today as it was 10 years ago) has designed a set of goals for its
donors to achieve on issues including agriculture, trade, tax evasion and
incentives, climate change, technology transfer, migration and regional
integration.

In pointing out that high levels of aid for long periods of time can be
anti-developmental, hindering rather than helping countries reduce poverty,
ActionAid's third Real Aid report is simply conveying to a western audience what
political and civil society leaders have long been saying in poor countries.

When its first Real Aid report came out in 2005, ActionAid was in the vanguard
of attempts to try to keep the aid world honest, claiming that as much 60% of
what the rich world claimed was aid was really "phantom". For countries like
France and the US, only 10% of aid counted as "real" ie genuinely targeted at
poverty reduction rather than tied to donor country purchases (of people or
things), double counted or otherwise misspent.

When it published Real Aid 2 a year later, ActionAid tackled the issue of
technical co-operation, which it described as "often overpriced and ineffective,
and in the worst cases destroys rather than builds the capacity of the poorest
countries".

In criticising aid, it risked the wrath of large donors reluctant to defend
their more artful practices in public. It also faced criticism from other NGOs
who were worried about washing dirty linen in public, where support for aid is
fragile.

The importance of this latest report is the way it develops a new narrative on
the role of aid that will be easy for many parts of the development community to
take on board. Critics of aid dependence have tended to lambast aid as harmful.
But this report adopts a different tone. Rather than dwell on aid's
shortcomings, it argues that aid spent well can itself contribute to reduced aid
dependence, particularly when it supports efforts to mobilise domestic
resources.

This is not paradoxical. Actually, it is pretty obvious. But those who have
previously been nervous about talking about "reducing aid dependence" will find
in this report an analysis they can comfortably adopt.

Since the first two Real Aid reports we have had five years of the , which has
sought to respond to many of Actionaid's criticisms. As the meeting on aid
effectiveness in Busan approaches, the idea that aid should always come with an
exit strategy is likely to be a central theme.

As bilateral aid gradually reduces in importance as a development issue, it
feels a bit like stepping into the unknown. We all know that trade, climate
change, tax evasion and a host of other issues are more important, but somehow
aid is manageable, deliverable, known. We don't really know what will happen on
the bigger issues, with so many powerful interests at play. All the more reason
for the NGOs to accelerate their shift away from being aid agencies and towards
being true development agencies.

But a reduction in bilateral aid does not mean an end to aid. Richer countries
still need to spend a couple of hundred billion dollars a year on global public
goods, developing a truly global public sphere to manage and contain liberalised
private interests and capital. That is the one of the most important projects of
the 21st century - but thinking on it has hardly begun. Perhaps it would make a
good thematic focus for Real Aid 4.

G20 summit a chance to rebuild foreign aid SIMON FEENY

BYLINE: The Canberra Times

SECTION: A; Pg. 13

LENGTH: 709  words


IMPROVING foreign aid effectiveness is one of the items on the agenda at the G20
summit being held in Melbourne this weekend.

Foreign aid to developing countries is increasing dramatically.

Aid flows increased by more than 30 per cent in 2005, reaching a record high of
$US106billion ($138Abillion).

Moreover, aid flows are expected to continue increasing with developed countries
(including members of the G20) promising to scale up their aid further in coming
years.

Last year, the Howard Government pledged to double Australia's foreign aid
budget by 2010.

But despite this being a sizeable increase over a relatively short time period,
it still means that Australia will provide far less aid than many developed
countries.

Scandinavian countries are already providing more than three times the amount of
aid provided by Australia, relative to the size of the their economies. In fact,
with the exception of France and Britain, the G20 members provide less foreign
aid than the average for developed countries. Further, they are a long way short
of achieving an aid budget reaching 0.7 per cent of their gross national income,
a target affirmed by many governments at the International Conference on
Financing for Development in Monterrey 2002.

Despite negative assertions regarding foreign aid effectiveness often appearing
in the Australian media, increases in aid budgets are generally met with
enthusiasm.

Concerns regarding the effectiveness of aid have largely been dissipated.

A large and expanding body of recent international research has highlighted the
benefits from foreign aid.

The clear consensus is that, on average, foreign aid is effective. While foreign
aid is no panacea for poverty reduction, it is widely accepted that large
increases in foreign aid are required to assist with the achievement of the
Millennium Development Goals - eight internationally agreed goals to improve the
wellbeing of people living in developing countries by 2015.

The UN Millennium Project estimates that 0.7 per cent of rich world GNI can
provide enough resources to meet the goals. Many countries particularly in
Africa and the Pacific are unlikely to achieve many of the goals given their
recent progress. This strengthens the case for further increases in G20 aid
budgets.

Increasing the level of overseas aid from governments has often been the focus
of pressure groups at summit meetings. However, improving the quality of
international aid is also crucial. Predictable, untied foreign aid, focused on
poverty reduction will improve its quality.

This includes the challenging task of achieving the right balance of aid devoted
to the social sectors (such as health, education, water and sanitation) and to
improving the level of governance in recipient countries.

Further, the recent and ongoing scaling up of foreign aid can place a huge
administrative burden on recipients.

They face negotiation, management and reporting requirements not just for an
increasing number of projects but also with an increasing number of donors.

However, this should not be used as an argument against the scaling up of aid.

Aid donors can help relieve these capacity constraints by following
recommendations to improve the quality of aid outlined in the Paris Declaration
on Aid Effectiveness and endorsed by all major G20 aid donors in 2005.

Recommendations include greater alignment of donor programs with partner country
development strategies, simplifying and harmonising donor procedures and
practices and strengthening recipient country ownership of aid programs.

Although these might be difficult things to measure, they are increasingly
important to improve the quality of aid.

While it is important to recognise that aid is just one of many factors
important for poverty reduction, it is clear that the G20 can assist in
achieving the Millennium Development Goals by 2015 by continuing to scale up
their aid budgets. However, the impacts of aid will be limited unless increases
in aid budgets are accompanied by improvements in aid effectiveness.

Increases in both the quantity and the quality of foreign aid from the G20 and
other countries are required.

Canadians disapprove of linking foreign aid to trade;
Findings show Ottawa's move toward focusing assistance on countries with deeper
trading ties won't win support

BYLINE: CAMPBELL CLARK

SECTION: NATIONAL NEWS; INNOVATIVE RESEARCH GROUP POLL; Pg. A5

LENGTH: 881 words

DATELINE: OTTAWA


Most Canadians want to give to poorer countries, and many want to give far more
- but the idea of linking aid to our economic interests turns people off, a new
poll finds.

Arguments that aid brings commercial benefits actually undermine support for
foreign aid, suggesting that Ottawa's move toward focusing aid on countries with
deeper trading ties won't win Canadians' backing.

"For them, it's not about selling stuff. It's not about us getting an advantage.
It's about us giving money for development," said Innovative Research Group
pollster Simon MacDougall.

In February, the Conservative government revamped Canada's bilateral aid
program, dropping countries from Africa, the world's poorest continent, from the
list of major aid recipients, and adding some from the Americas - notably those
with whom Canada has recently signed free-trade deals, or started trade talks:
Peru, Colombia and the Caribbean. However, the Conservatives have also untied
all food aid so that it doesn't have to be bought in Canada. In addition,
they've promised that all kinds of aid will be untied by 2012 so none of it has
to be purchased through contracts with Canadian companies.

A poll conducted by Innovative Research Group for the Munk Centre for
International Studies found that 61 per cent of respondents believe foreign aid
does more good than harm.

And half, or 49 per cent, support the idea of more than doubling aid to late
prime minister Lester B. Pearson's goal of 0.7 per cent of the size of the
Canadian economy - an increase to about $10-billion per year. (Canada now spends
about $4.1-billion on aid.)

The poll used an internet panel with 1,383 respondents, a sample size that is
typically considered accurate within 2.6 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.
However, an internet panel is not a random sample so does not have a
statistically valid margin of error.

The poll was conducted as the Munk Centre prepares for a debate on aid today as
part of its Munk Debates series.

But the pollsters also tried to test some ideas about what drives support or
opposition to aid through "regressions." They asked people what they thought of
some arguments for and against it, and then checked if the arguments changed
their support for aid in general.

They found that one argument stood out in persuading people that aid is
beneficial - essentially that poverty wreaks havoc, and wealthy nations have an
interest in making the world a better place: "Given that extreme poverty can
cause civil wars, epidemics and regional instability in the developing world it
is in the interest of wealthy nations to provide foreign aid."

Some arguments, like the idea that rich nations have a moral responsibility to
aid poor ones, in the same way people pay taxes to help poor people, garnered
wide agreement, but didn't actually make people more supportive of foreign aid.

But another statement that was supposed to be positive about foreign aid
actually had a negative effect on support: "By improving the quality of life of
people in developing countries, wealthy nations' foreign aid programs help
create bigger markets for their goods and services."

It's not that everyone rebelled at the concept that aid nets trade - in fact, 58
per cent said it made them more likely to believe aid does more good than harm,
and only 21 per cent said it made them more negative.

But when they were tested to see if their support for aid had really changed,
the argument had backfired. Those who accepted a link between aid and trade
didn't become more positive about supporting aid - but those who rejected the
link between aid and commercial interests became more negative about giving aid.

For some, raising commercial benefits may taint the altruistic impulse of giving
aid to make the world a better place.

Gerry Barr, the president of the Canadian Council for International
Co-operation, an aid advocacy organization, suggested that perhaps raising a
trade argument makes people suspicious that the aid is a Trojan horse: that the
real goal is selling Canadian goods, and aid is just a lure.

"It may amount to a conclusion that that is deceptively wrong as a claim - that
most often aid is not well-used when it is used as an instrument for the
promotion of trade," he said.

In fact, the most effective argument against foreign aid turned out to be
something like that: that aid is a means to commercial exploitation.

The statement, "Because foreign aid is often conditional on recipient nations
opening their economies to Western goods and services it encourages the economic
exploitation of the poor countries" was the most persuasive in turning
respondents away from aid.

But the most commonly heard criticism of foreign aid - that it is mismanaged by
donors and users, or stolen by corrupt foreign officials - was widely accepted
as a negative factor, but it had little impact in changing peoples' minds, and
turning them off foreign aid.

Canadians don't seem to buy the arguments that free trade is a better means to
lift poor nations out of poverty than aid. When they heard it, more said it
actually made them more positive about aid than negative - although it obviously
had a bigger impact with those who believe it, because it did have some effect
in dialling down support for aid.

AIDS Vancouver's board breaks with fund-raising arm, then quits: The
organization's biggest donor is watching developments closely

SOURCE: Vancouver Sun

BYLINE: Patti Edgar

SECTION: News; Pg. B7

LENGTH: 620 words

Directors of AIDS Vancouver have resigned en masse and the group's largest donor
is closely scrutinizing its operations while deciding whether to examine its
books.

But no one is talking about what prompted the situation, which came to a head
when the AIDS Vancouver board ended its contract with a new fund-raising group
at a Nov. 26 meeting.

Staff and former board members at AIDS Vancouver said they can't comment and
executive director Valerie Atyeo did not return phone calls.

Officials from the Vancouver Coastal Health Authority plan to meet with Atyeo
next week to talk about the situation and could decide later this month to
assess how the organization spends its money, said Michelle Stewart, a
spokeswoman with the health authority.

The authority gives AIDS Vancouver the bulk of its funding -- $1.6 million each
year.

"Our primary concern is whether or not the services we fund are in place and
whether they will be impacted by any of this," she said. "The information that
we have back from AIDS Vancouver is that the resources we have provided to AIDS
Vancouver are being used appropriately."

Since the board's resignation, AIDS Vancouver and its four-month-old fund-
raising arm, the AIDS B.C. Foundation, have accused each other of mismanagement.

In a Nov. 29 letter to the AIDS B.C. Foundation, a lawyer for AIDS Vancouver
listed seven reasons for terminating the contract with the fund raisers.

Included were allegations the foundation issued tax receipts without Atyeo's
signature and mailed out a fund-raising letter focusing on children with AIDS,
despite children not being a target of AIDS Vancouver's services.

Lawyers for the AIDS B.C. Foundation responded Wednesday with their own letter,
rebutting the allegations and saying senior staff at AIDS Vancouver were aware
of what staff at the fund-raising arm were doing.

AIDS B.C. Foundation chair Alan Fetherstonhaugh is accusing AIDS Vancouver of
obscuring the real issues behind ending the contract. He alleges the staff were
uncomfortable with the kind of questions AIDS B.C. Foundation staff were asking
about AIDS Vancouver's operations, especially how many clients the organization
has.

In a Nov. 22 report to AIDS Vancouver, executive director Thomas Easkin wrote
that conflicting data has made work difficult for his staff. His team is
"ethically obliged by our Association of Fundraising Professionals, and also
basic human ethics, to present both data and statistics that are accurate and
not misleading," he wrote.

Fetherstonhaugh is calling for an inquiry into how AIDS Vancouver spends its
money.

"There are reputations at stake here, including mine," he said. "They can't run
around saying we did something wrong."

Lawyers for the foundation are asking AIDS Vancouver for about $20,000 in
severance pay, outstanding bills and legal fees. AIDS B.C. Foundation had three
full-time staff members and one contract employee.

A spokesman for another AIDS organization in Vancouver, the B.C. Persons with
AIDS Society, said AIDS Vancouver should have never set up the fund-raising arm
in the first place.

"The AIDS community in the province is happy to see its demise," said Malsah,
who does not have a last name. "It was a model that purported to raise money on
behalf of the AIDS organizations in the province, yet there was no consultation
with us."

Fetherstonhaugh said the foundation never misled the organizations from which it
solicited funds. Eventually, the AIDS B.C. Foundation was going to expand and
work for more organizations than just AIDS Vancouver, he added.

AIDS Vancouver has operated in the city since 1983, offering services for people
with AIDS and education programs to residents.

It started when a stranger asked for help.

A woman walked into Jesus Aguais's office at St. Vincent's Manhattan Hospital in
the fall of 1996. She had traveled from Venezuela because her son and
daughter-in-law had tested positive for H.I.V., she said, and she had sold
everything, including her burial plot, to come to the United States for
medicine. The drugs they needed for survival cost $1,000 per month.

Her story gave him an idea. Mr. Aguais, an AIDS educator at St. Vincent's and an
H.I.V. activist, had been collecting surplus medication from friends and storing
it, but until then, he said, he was unsure what to do with it.

"Who makes $1,000 a month in South America?" he asked in an interview. "I had to
get organized."

He started Aid for AIDS, which collects donated medication from across the
United States and Canada, from various sources, including from people with
H.I.V. who change prescriptions, stop taking a certain medication, or die. The
drugs are inspected and then sent overseas to needy people with H.I.V. who would
not otherwise have access to medications.

The medicine collected by Aid for AIDS comes from patients, social workers and
doctors. The organization says it is now helping to keep alive 300 people from
Ecuador to Ethiopia, through its shipments and efforts to find local health
care.

Aid for AIDS is small -- just three employees -- and most of its money comes
from private donors. (It is a federally registered charitable group.) The group,
whose office is on Greenwich Street in Manhattan, hopes to raise $100,000 at a
fund-raiser on Monday at Latincollector, a gallery at 153 Hudson Street between
Hubert and Laight Streets.

"With an overhead of just $150,000, we sent over $3.5 million worth of AIDS
medication last year," Mr. Aguais said. "Now a lot of people have their eye on
us." Although the program has been praised by the United Nations' AIDS
organization and the World Bank, it has been operating in a legal gray area.
According to the Food and Drug Administration, the program violates the Food,
Drug and Cosmetic Act, which forbids the delivery or receipt of drugs from any
source other than the manufacturer, processor, packer or distributor.

"There is no quality assurance once the medication has left the pharmacy," said
Richard Klein, the H.I.V./AIDS program director at the F.D.A. "It's a
humanitarian program, but there is no guarantee of the drugs' integrity."

While the F.D.A. questions the legality of drug recycling, it has not received
any reports of tainted drugs or drugs that have lost their potency being
processed through Aid for AIDS and has not tried to stop its work. But Mr. Klein
said that it was unlikely that the agency would hear complaints since the
recipients are outside its jurisdiction.

Aid for AIDS says the group is not breaking any laws. "This absolutely does not
violate the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act," said Paul O'Dwyer, the lawyer
representing Aid for AIDS. "They are not going to touch any medication if there
is the possibility that it was adulterated."

Aid for AIDS does not accept unsealed bottles of liquid medicine, organizers
say, and each tablet and capsule is checked to ensure it has the pharmaceutical
imprint. "These are very unique drugs," Mr. Aguais said. "If someone is going to
do damage to them, they are going to have to own a lab."

While the group is aware that its drugs can end up on the black market, it is
adamant that what it is doing is better than doing nothing. "You can never be
totally sure, but this is about surviving," Mr. Aguais said. "We did what we
needed to do in order to save lives." The organization keeps a three-month
supply in stock for each person. There is a long waiting list to enroll, the
group says, because it still has limited drug supplies.

Organizers say that they send medicine only to people whose T-cells -- a type of
white blood cell -- are down to a count of 250. Aid for AIDS requires (and pays
for) blood tests done in the recipients' home countries every six months to
ensure that they are adhering to the treatment. Jaime Valencia, the clinical
coordinator for Aid for AIDS, says that some packages of drugs are sent directly
to patients and some to doctors, and that the group keeps in regular contact
with both.

"These kinds of programs have to have really strict guidelines," Mr. Aguais
said, because some of the drugs are toxic and the virus can become resistant to
treatment if a person does not adhere to the regimen.

Even with the strict requirements, the medication from Aid for AIDS was a
godsend for a Venezuelan family: Sandra Varela, 32; her husband, Americo
Teijeiro, 39; and their 6-year-old son, Alejandro. They received drugs from Aid
for AIDS in 1996, shortly after finding out that they were all H.I.V.-positive.
Although the family is now receiving free medicines through a health insurance
program administered by the Venezuelan government, Mr. Teijeiro said that the
year they were helped by Aid for AIDS was critical.

"It meant life, basically," Mr. Teijeiro, a taxi driver, said in a phone call
from Caracas. "We wouldn't be here today if it hadn't been for their help. I
know our son wouldn't. He was born with the virus and he is doing great, going
to school and leading a normal life."

The work done by Aid for AIDS has been called "a very important initiative" by
Bertil Lindblad, deputy director at the New York office of the Joint United
Nations Program on H.I.V./AIDS, known as Unaids. And the AIDS Education and
Treatment Initiative has sent people to Aid for AIDS. The initiative is run by
Hans Binswanger, an AIDS activist and director of the rural, social and
environmental development program for Africa at the World Bank.

"In the U.S. and Canada there are six or seven groups that collect medication
and send them to developing countries," Mr. Binswanger said. "Aid for AIDS is
the biggest and the best."

Aid for AIDS just absorbed another group based in New York, Hope's Alive, that
sends medication to an orphanage in Trinidad. To Nicole Guide, the founder of
Hope's Alive, discarding or not using the surplus of medication in this country
is part of a "culture of waste."

"People would rather throw away food than send it to somebody who's starving,"
she said. "It's the same with medicine."

The concept of recycling and even sharing AIDS drugs is not new. Michael, an
H.I.V.-positive man who has donated medication to Aid for AIDS and who asked
that his last name not be used, said that it is not uncommon for friends to
share pills informally with someone who does not have medication handy.

Another man who has donated drugs to Aid for AIDS said he was motivated by
gratitude. "I've been very fortunate in receiving the care that I need," said
Bill, who also asked that his last name not be used. "This is a good way to help
others and pay back the good fortune I've had."

Aid for AIDS's work has not attracted a lot of attention from the pharmaceutical
and insurance industries. Paul Macielak, president of the New York Health Plan
Association, a trade organization representing managed care companies, said that
drug recycling seemed to be unknown from the group's standpoint. "Health plans
are not able to recoup pills or medication from members," he said. "We have no
significant involvement with the issue."

One doctor who volunteers for Hope's Alive said he understands that drug
regulations are vital to protect people in the United States, but he said that
the situation in poor countries is so dire that the same rules should not apply.

The doctor, Dr. Edward L. Handelsman, an assistant professor of pediatrics at
State University of New York Downstate Medical Center and Kings County Hospital
Center in Brooklyn, travels to Trinidad for Hope's Alive to monitor children's
progress. "The F.D.A.'s opinion notwithstanding, the simple fact is without the
medicine, the children will die -- some right now, some later," Dr. Handelsman
said. "Either you do it in a roundabout way, or you don't do it."

AIDS-RELATED DEATHS IN PHILA. DROP 23.5 PERCENT / THE EPIDEMIC ISN'T WANING,
OFFICIALS SAID. NEW CASES IN THE CITY INCREASED, THOUGH THEY DROPPED IN THE
SUBURBS.

BYLINE: Huntly Collins, INQUIRER STAFF WRITER

SECTION: CITY & REGION; Pg. B01

LENGTH: 896 words


The number of people dying from AIDS-related illness dropped 23.5 percent in
Philadelphia last year, the first decline since the AIDS epidemic began 16 years
ago.

Figures released by the Health Department yesterday showed that 574 people died
from complications of AIDS in 1996, down from 750 in 1995.

The decline is in line with national trends reported last month, which showed
that AIDS deaths dropped an average of 13 percent across the country during the
first six months of 1996 compared with a similar period in 1995.

City health officials, AIDS doctors and AIDS care providers attributed the
unprecedented drop mainly to more and better medicines to attack the AIDS virus
and improved tests that allow physicians to monitor the effects of the new drug
combinations by measuring the amount of virus in a patient's bloodstream.

"This should raise a lot of hope," said James McAnaney, supervisor of AIDS
surveillance for the city Health Department. McAnaney released the new data.

McAnaney cautioned, however, that the numbers do not signal any letup in the
AIDS epidemic itself, only that AIDS patients are living longer.

In fact, new AIDS cases increased in the city last year, although they dropped
in the suburbs.

The AIDS mortality data were taken from the death certificates of AIDS patients
in the city's AIDS register. Similar mortality numbers were not immediately
available from the suburbs.

McAnaney said a preliminary analysis indicated that the reduction in AIDS
mortality was evenly distributed, with blacks and Latinos experiencing as much
of a decline as whites.

AIDS doctors said they were heartened by the new data, which confirmed what they
have been seeing in their practices for many months. Over the last year, the
doctors said, there has been a marked decline in the number of AIDS patients who
are hospitalized with serious secondary infections and AIDS-related cancers.

"We have all sensed it's been happening, but it's encouraging to hear the
statistics," said Rob Roy MacGregor, an infectious-disease doctor at the the
University of Pennsylvania Medical Center.

Norma E. Muurahainen, medical director of the HIV early intervention program at
Graduate Hospital, said she used to have half a dozen AIDS patients in the
hospital at any given time. "There have been weeks this past year when we've had
no patients in the hospital," she said.

Marla Gold, who coordinates HIV care for Allegheny University of the Health
Sciences, said she used to draw a graph for AIDS patients, predicting how many
years they would likely live. "I can no longer draw that graph," she said.

The doctors said that only part of the improved mortality figures stem from the
advent of a new class of anti-AIDS drugs known as protease inhibitors. They
became widely available just last spring.

But even before the advent of the protease inhibitors, several new AIDS
medicines were approved for use, and doctors gained access to sophisticated
tests that allowed them to monitor the drugs' ability to reduce the amount of
AIDS virus in a patient's bloodstream. If certain drugs were no longer effective
in a particular patient, the treatment regimen could be changed.

AIDS experts said the large number of clinical trials conducted in Philadelphia
gave patients here considerable access to cutting-edge medicines. An estimated
700 local patients were enrolled in AIDS clinical trials in 1996.

Besides new anti-retroviral drugs, AIDS patients have also benefited from
advances in medicines to prevent or treat secondary infections such as
pneumonia.

David Fair, the city's first AIDS director and former head of We the People
Living with HIV/AIDS, attributed the drop in AIDS-related deaths in part to
availability of AIDS specialists at the city's six major medical centers.

"In Philadelphia, no matter what your socio-economic situation, you are probably
more likely to find a good AIDS doctor than in other cities," Fair said.

AIDS experts expressed concern that the improved mortality figures would give
the false impression that the disease had been cured.

They pointed out that while the new drugs are promising, no one knows how long
their beneficial effects will last. And many AIDS patients cannot - or will not
- take the new drugs.

"This is the time to step up the effort, not the time to let go and assume it's
over," said Jane Schull, executive director of Philadelphia FIGHT, which
coordinates community-based trials of experimental AIDS drugs. "It is in no way
over."

While figures indicate that the AIDS epidemic may be on the wane in the
Philadelphia suburbs, the epidemic is still growing in the city.

There were 369 newly reported AIDS cases in the Philadelphia suburbs last year,
down from 483 in 1995. It was the third consecutive year the figure had dropped
in Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Montgomery, Burlington, Camden, Gloucester and
Salem Counties.

But in the city, the number of new AIDS cases rose from 1,294 in 1995 to 1,302
last year. Seventy-one percent of the new cases were among African Americans and
16 percent were among women.

The AIDS cases tracked by public health officials include only people with fully
developed AIDS. Officials estimate that there are 30,000 people in the
Philadelphia area who are infected with the AIDS virus, half of whom are unaware
that they are infected.

ITA: HOW TO TELL YOUR CHILD ABOUT AIDS

SOURCE: QNP

BYLINE: BUTTROSE I

LENGTH: 1650 words


]PAGE 2 TURNHEAD: AIDS: What to tell your child From Page 1 THE National
Advisory Committee on AIDS believes that as a matter of priority young people
should be told the facts about AIDS so they can protect themselves and stop its
spread.

If we fail to make sure children are educated properly about AIDS which the
Health Minister, Dr Blewett, described in Federal Parliament as the biggest
public health problem Australia has faced since Federation, then AIDS will be a
frightening threat to our children.

There is no cure and no vaccine _ and no likelihood of either for many years to
come.

It is vital that we teach children a code of sexual behavior that will last them
for a lifetime.

Children are aware that AIDS is being widely discussed both in the media and
throughout the community. It is inevitable that young children will have many
questions on the subject. They will ask their parents or other adults they
trust.

Children already talk about AIDS in school playgrounds. Often their discussions
are triggered by something they have seen on television or read in a newspaper.

For some children this can cause increased fear and concern about the issue.
Parents' response to questions will be crucial in forming the basis of their
child's understanding, attitudes and future actions.

That response must be sensitive, accurate and honest.

Sensitive because information about AIDS can create much fear which can lead to
denial of the issue.

Accurate because with AIDS there is a choice. We can all choose not to put
ourselves at risk of contracting the AIDS virus, but to make that choice we need
accurate information.

Finally, being honest is vital if our children are to trust the information we
give them.

There is nothing wrong with admitting that you don't know the answers to
particular questions.

Be honest about it, and use one of the many services that exist to find out what
you don't already know. Your doctor, hospital, community health centre, health
department, AIDS council or information line can all assist you with
information.

Ultimately your discussion with your child should aim to increase his or her
understanding of the issues, and should confirm, clarify and sometimes correct
what he or she already knows.

Firstly, find out how much your child knows about AIDS, and where the
information came from. It's possible that children will have seen or heard a
great deal, some of which may have been contradictory.

Next, make sure that you are comfortable with the information you have, and that
you've given some thought to how you might deal with questions you might find
embarrassing. There is no need to be technical or scientific when answering
questions about AIDS.

Most people have difficulty understanding and relating to information that is
presented in a technical manner. The less personal the facts sound, the less
likely your child will be to take the information on board.

Information should always be presented in a clear, positive and understandable
way. This means using language that is simple and explicit.

Check regularly to see whether your child understands what you have been talking
about. Ask him or her!

Avoid presenting information which is loaded with fear tactics and negative
messages. Be positive: it's important that children know that they can stop
themselves from becoming infected with the AIDS virus.

Any discussion about AIDS must, and will, involve a discussion of sex. The less
education your child has had in this area, the greater the task; the younger the
child the more difficult the job of talking to him or her.

Remember, young children will ask questions regarding sexuality and AIDS
provided they can do so in a supportive and trusting environment.

Work at establishing a mutually caring and trusting relationship _ one in which
your child will feel able and confident to discuss the issue.

Inevitably, the issue of sexual preferences will emerge. AIDS has been
associated mostly with homosexuals, and this group has been most affected by
far.

But now it is clear that the AIDS virus knows no barriers. AIDS can affect men,
women and children whether homosexual or heterosexual. AIDS has no cultural,
racial or geographic barriers.

It is important to establish early in your discussion that you don't need to be
homosexual to get AIDS. Everyone who does not take certain precautions is at
risk.

If your child asks questions about sexual preferences _ heterosexuality,
homosexuality _ discuss them honestly, in the context of the personal choices
which people make about their sexual relationships. A summary of the facts you
need is: AIDS stands for Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome;

It is a disease caused by a virus;

Anyone can get the AIDS virus _ men, women, children;

The virus lives in some body fluids _ especially blood and semen;

When someone gets the virus he or she can infect other people;

People can remain healthy with the virus in them;

Not everybody who gets the virus goes on to develop what is called full-blown
AIDS, which causes people to get sick and then to die; and A person with AIDS
cannot fight off certain rare infections and many common ones because AIDS
breaks down the body's immune system.

AIDS is not an easy disease to catch: the virus is caught only when it directly
enters the bloodstream.

The AIDS virus is passed on in three main ways: Vaginal or anal intercourse
without a condom;

Using unclean needles and syringes _ if the needle or syringe has been used by
someone else it may contain the AIDS virus; and From mother to baby, in the womb
or during the birth process.

In the past some people caught AIDS through infected blood transfusions. Since
May 1985 in Australia, all blood and blood products are tested and heat-treated.
This process eliminates the virus.

Australia now has the safest blood transfusion service in the world.

There are many myths about AIDS. This sometimes causes fear which is why it is
important for children (and parents) to know the facts about AIDS.

AIDS is not spread by casual contact. For example, you can't get AIDS from
swimming pools or public toilets, by kissing, shaking hands, hugging, sneezing,
coughing or spitting, from mosquitoes or fleas, or by working or having social
contact with someone who has the AIDS virus.

People living in the same household with a person with AIDS are not at risk
unless they have unsafe sexual contact (i.e. without condoms).

The AIDS virus is removed by normal washing of cups and dishes.

It is possible that your child may come into contact with a child with the AIDS
virus at school.

None of the identified children with AIDS in America or Australia has
transmitted AIDS to another child in the home, school, day-care or foster-care
setting.

There is no case of AIDS which is known or suspected to have been passed from
one child to another in America or Australia. Casual contact, even over a long
period of time, is not considered dangerous.

There have been no cases transmitted by one child biting another.

There have been no cases of transmission of the virus through sporting injuries.

A child carrying the AIDS virus is more at risk of picking up other nasty
infections, such as chicken pox, from other children than passing on the AIDS
infection.

Teachers or school personnel with AIDS do not represent any danger to the other
teachers or the children because AIDS is not spread through casual contact or
through air, food or water.

In the early stages AIDS may not cause any symptoms. The symptoms eventually
developed by AIDS victims are related to the disease or infections that attack
them because of their inability to fight off infection.

These symptoms are similar to those everyone feels from time to time, but in the
case of infection with the AIDS virus they are more severe and prolonged.

AIDS symptoms are: Extreme tiredness, sometimes combined with headache;

Weight loss of more than 5kg which is not due to dieting;

Persistent swollen glands in the neck, armpits or groin;

Heavy, continual dry cough not related to smoking or common respiratory
infection;

Continuing bouts of diarrhoea;

Thick, whitish patches on the tongue or in the throat (thrush) which may be
accompanied by a sore throat;

Unexplained bleeding from any body opening or from the skin or mucous membranes;

Bruising more easily than usual;

Progressive shortness of breath; and Cold sores persisting for more than one
month.

Most AIDS patients have had either or both a lung infection with pneumonia
called Pneucystis carinif, or a rare type of cancer which usually occurs
anywhere on the surface of the skin or in the mouth and looks like a round,
bluish, raised patch. This is called Kaposi's carcoma. Some AIDS patients show
symptoms of brain disease or severe damage to the spinal cord.

Prevention of AIDS is the most important part of what you tell your chld about
the disease.

Prevention needs to be treated in a positive and sensitive manner, not only
because it will prevent transmission of AIDS, but because it encourages sexual
respect.

The best way to prevent the spread of AIDS is by abstinence.

Otherwise, the National Advisory Committee on AIDS recommends that condoms be
used outside an exclusively monogamous relationship. Used correctly, condoms
provide effective protection from AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases.

Make sure your children understand that AIDS is not spread by casual, non-sexual
contact. It is spread by high-risk sexual and drug-related behavior _ behavior
which we can all choose to avoid.

Telling children the truth about AIDS doesn't mean we will encourage promiscuity
or the taking of drugs.

One of the most important steps in stopping the spread of AIDS is giving our
children the knowledge they need and deserve.

AIDS and Drugs

SECTION: Section 7;  Page 4;  Column 4;  Book Review Desk

LENGTH: 568 words


To the Editor:

In her review of my "Inventing the AIDS Virus" (April 7), June E. Osborn writes:
"This book is destructive of personal morale, prevention efforts and public
understanding both of H.I.V./AIDS and of biomedical science in general. It has
the potential to wreak serious harm at a crucial point in the AIDS epidemic." At
the same time, Dr. Osborn faithfully defends the H.I.V.-AIDS orthodoxy with
"enormous bodies of evidence . . . that firmly implicate H.I.V. in AIDS" but
without being able to provide the one paper that proves that H.I.V. causes AIDS.

Yet 12 years and $35 billion after starting the war on AIDS in the name of the
hypothesis that H.I.V. causes AIDS, America has no vaccine and no drug, has lost
over 300,000 lives to AIDS and has yet to save the first AIDS patient. This is a
sad testimony to the inability of the scientific and medical community to deal
with AIDS properly.

In such a situation the scientific method calls for new, alternative hypotheses
to compete with the unproductive H.I.V.-AIDS hypothesis. The scientific method
functions very much like the free market economy: it provides the taxpayer and
the patient with the most competitive and productive scientific theory.

"Inventing the AIDS Virus" has done exactly this. It provides a coherent and
extensively documented alternative AIDS hypothesis. It is proposing that
American and European AIDS is the medical consequence of the long-term
consumption of recreational drugs and of antiviral drugs like AZT. This
hypothesis is a synthesis and extension of the Centers for Disease Control's
very own pre-1984 "life style" hypothesis of AIDS, and of many recent studies
that document the toxicity of AZT. The drug-AIDS hypothesis is very testable and
could prevent, even cure, AIDS at a fraction of the annual $7.5 billion Federal
AIDS budget currently invested in the unproductive H.I.V. hypothesis. In the
light of the drug hypothesis, H.I.V. is a harmless passenger virus, and AIDS is
an entirely preventable, and in part curable, consequence of the drug epidemic.

One would expect Dr. Osborn to give an alternative to the failed H.I.V.
hypothesis some serious consideration. Yet there is not a single complimentary
sentence in her review. Wearing her H.I.V.-AIDS blinkers, she not only
misunderstands but also misrepresents the drug-AIDS hypothesis.

For example, contrary to Dr. Osborn's assertion, "Inventing the AIDS Virus" does
not assert that "gay men in whom AIDS was diagnosed in the early years . . .
were not being truthful if they denied drug use." The book documents with dozens
of references that if asked, gay men with AIDS all reported abundant
recreational drug use.

Also, contrary to Dr. Osborn, I do not "dismiss" AIDS in other countries. Both
Chapter 6 and Chapter 8 and an appended scientific paper deal extensively with
AIDS in other countries and its causes, which are malnutrition, parasitic
infection and poor sanitation.

In the face of our AIDS epidemic and in the name of science, I object to a
partial and political review of my book. Isn't our common enemy AIDS rather than
Peter Duesberg and other H.I.V. dissidents? Should AIDS be the winner of this
debate because dissidents must be losers? Wouldn't it be prudent to divert a few
million dollars from the annual $7.5 billion AIDS budget into just one
alternative hypothesis?

SYMPOSIUM: FOREIGN AID TO AFRICA: A HOLLOW HOPE?*

NAME: Kwame Akonor**

BIO: * This essay is based on the author's statement at the 12th Annual Herbert
Rubin and Judge Rose Luttan Rubin International Law Symposium, "The Future of a
Continent: Law and Policy of Sub-Saharan African Children," held at New York
University School of Law on October 29, 2007.

** Dr. Kwame Akonor is an Assistant Professor of International Relations at
Seton Hall University and director of the university's Africana Center. He is
also director of the African Development Institute (ADI), a New York based
thinktank that advocates self-reliant and endogenous development policies for
Africa. Dr. Akonor is the author of Africa and IMF Conditionality (Routledge,
2006) and was recently a post-doctoral fellow at Cambridge University.

LEXISNEXIS SUMMARY:
 ... Thus, African leaders should take control of their countries' economic
destinies and find creative ways to finance development other than reliance on
foreign aid.  ... One family of justificatory arguments aims to establish the
essential rightness of foreign aid and the West's moral obligation to provide
it: Helping Africa through foreign aid is not only charitable but morally
correct, and repairs the conditions of injustice and inequality that permeate
the international political economy.  ... The fact is that none of the foreign
aid to Africa is aimed at transforming Africa's structurally dependent
economies.  ... While scholars and practitioners disagree on the effectiveness
of foreign aid in general, the irrefutable fact remains that during a period
when aid has risen over time as a percent of income in Africa, Africa's growth
rate has concurrently fallen.  ... Aid advocates explain Africa's abysmal
development record despite huge aid inflows by what I call the "aid quantity
argument." ... This proposal, known as the "Big Push," claims that a massive
infusion of well-targeted aid is necessary to end Africa's poverty.  ... The
most promising strategy on the table can be termed the "targeted aid" approach.
... Post-independence foreign aid in Africa has largely been wasted, mismanaged,
or misdirected.  ... Such projects would transform Africa's disarticulated
infrastructures and improve the continent's global position.  ... At the dawn of
this century, more than fifty percent of sub-Saharan African budgets and seventy
percent of their public investment came from foreign aid.

TEXT:
 [*1071]

   Recent years have seen a surge in calls for more foreign aid to Africa in
order to eliminate the continent's poverty. International organizations,
scholars, celebrities, and philanthropists have all made renewed pleas for a
massive infusion of development aid. They generally present two arguments to
justify more foreign aid to Africa. One family of justificatory arguments aims
to establish the essential rightness of foreign aid and the West's moral
obligation to provide it: Helping Africa through foreign aid is not only
charitable but morally correct, and repairs the conditions of injustice and
inequality that permeate the international political economy. Redolent of the
familiar "white man's burden" to uplift the peoples of the "dark continent" from
gloom, ignorance, and despondency, this justification derives force from its
missionary zeal. n1 Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair's memorable
description of the continent as a "scar on the conscience of the world," as well
as his insistence that the international community  [*1072]  could heal it, is a
classic illustration of this normative perspective on foreign aid to Africa. n2

   The second argument posits that injecting more foreign aid into Africa would
materially benefit its people. Jeffrey Sachs's 2005 book The End of Poverty and
the United Nations (UN) Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) have given this line
of reasoning credibility and exposure. n3 The UN Development Programme (UNDP),
for instance, claims that "aid provides governments with a resource for making
the multiple investments in health, education and economic infrastructure needed
to break cycles of deprivation." n4

   These two families of justificatory arguments for sending foreign aid to
Africa are logically independent of one another and are not mutually exclusive.
However, both lines of argument are problematic and I will critique each in
turn. Ultimately, aid to Africa is a band-aid, not a long-term solution, and
African leaders themselves are responsible for creating true, systemic change.

   The Normative Argument

 The principle of sending aid to Africa on moral grounds is problematic for two
reasons. First, it reinforces the negative stereotype (held by some in the
development policy community) of Africa as a "helpless child" and as a continent
of "beggars." The implication is that Africa is clueless when it comes  [*1073]
to its own development and will perpetually have to depend on foreign assistance
(the fact that African countries are the largest recipients of foreign aid does
little to rebut this impression). n5 Second, the argument that this aid will
break the structural cycle of dependency is disingenuous. The fact is that none
of the foreign aid to Africa is aimed at transforming Africa's structurally
dependent economies. Indeed, the direction and targets of aid thus far have done
little to empower and strengthen the continent relative to other actors in the
global political economy. n6 Moreover, those who champion the moral argument,
when pushed, generally admit that their calls for intervention are self serving
and not purely altruistic. n7 The primary true objective cited for African aid
is to reduce poverty in order to provide a bulwark against terrorism. n8

   The Empirical Argument

 As for the empirical argument, the evidence is overwhelmingly against those who
argue that aid can lift Africa out of  [*1074]  poverty. The record shows that
foreign aid has failed to deliver in any meaningful way. n9 According to most
estimates, the West has spent close to $ 600 billion on foreign aid to Africa
since the 1960s. n10 While scholars and practitioners disagree on the
effectiveness of foreign aid in general, n11 the irrefutable fact remains that
during a period when aid has risen over time as a percent of income in Africa,
Africa's growth rate has concurrently fallen. n12 Even the UN and World Bank
have recently admitted that Africa, the region receiving the most aid, will not
meet its development benchmarks by 2015. n13

   Aid advocates explain Africa's abysmal development record despite huge aid
inflows by what I call the "aid quantity argument." First, aid advocates argue
that it is unfair and misleading to cite aid amounts in aggregate terms. They
point out that while aggregating decades of aid provided to Africa may make that
amount of aid sound significant, the average  [*1075]  "receipts" per African
per week or day are negligible. n14 For example, a claim that Africa has
received $ 500 billion in aid over a fifty year period averages to only about
ten dollars per person per year or twenty cents per person per week.

   Second, aid advocates point out that the amount of aid given to Africa is a
drop in the bucket compared to the total national wealth of the Western
developed countries. One frequently cited example is that the United States,
though it has the largest gross domestic product (GDP) in the world, spends only
one hundredth of its budget on foreign aid to sub-Saharan Africa. n15 In other
words, they argue, the results of development aid are not discernable in Africa
solely because very little aid has been provided. Indeed, some aid advocates use
this argument to call for further increases in the volume of aid to Africa. This
proposal, known as the "Big Push," claims that a massive infusion of
well-targeted aid is necessary to end Africa's poverty. n16

   However, the aid quantity argument is a fallacy. It overestimates the
potential benefit of foreign aid by assuming that more aid money would
automatically lead to more development. It has been well documented that
unaccountable leadership - not a lack of money - is at the heart of Africa's
underdevelopment. n17 For example, the African Union estimates that Africa loses
$ 148 billion (<euro>114.28 billion), or a quarter of  [*1076]  its entire GDP,
to corruption every year. n18 It would be an understatement to suggest that some
of these misused funds must come from foreign aid. n19 Moreover, there is no
evidence that more aid money would necessarily lead to favorable development
outcomes. This is because the total volume of aid, in and of itself, tells us
nothing about how that money is disbursed or why a given aid-sponsored project
succeeds or fails.

   Given this poor investment performance, the challenge for the aid industry is
to rethink aid delivery. The most promising strategy on the table can be termed
the "targeted aid" approach. n20 Proponents of this strategy push not only for
more aid, but for the right aid. In other words, they claim that the impact of
foreign aid depends on both its quantity and its quality. Unfortunately, there
is little evidence so far that the targeted approach works. n21 Further, as
William Easterly and others have pointed out, aid donors and advocates have not
learned from their past mistakes and thus will be likely to continue making
them. n22 Post-independence foreign aid in Africa has largely been wasted,
mismanaged, or misdirected. If the targeted aid approach is to be meaningful to
ordinary Africans, it must focus more on transcontinental projects, such as
[*1077]  highways, telecommunications, and power plants. Such projects would
transform Africa's disarticulated infrastructures and improve the continent's
global position. Of course, such projects raise the prospect of a united and
empowered Africa - a goal Western donors have never championed.

   Concluding Thoughts: The Way Forward

 Foreign aid is not a panacea for Africa's development woes. So far, foreign aid
has created a welfare-continent mentality and has become the hub around which
the spokes of most African economies turn. At the dawn of this century, more
than fifty percent of sub-Saharan African budgets and seventy percent of their
public investment came from foreign aid. n23 This is unfortunate, particularly
given that Africa is one of the most resource-rich continents. n24 Dependence on
foreign aid has compromised the sovereignty of African states. Most aid packages
(even those from charities) come with stipulations and conditions to which
countries must adhere before further aid is disbursed. n25 In the future, the
link between aid and conditions will only grow tighter. The Millennium Challenge
Corporation (MCC), a newly created U.S. agency, exemplifies this trend.
Established in January 2004, the "MCC is based on the principle that aid is most
effective when it reinforces good governance, economic freedom and investments
in people." n26 Simply put, countries that do not embrace capitalism and
democracy will not be eligible for aid.

   Africa's development will not materialize from outside sources. Thus, African
leaders should take control of their  [*1078]  countries' economic destinies and
find creative ways to finance development other than reliance on foreign aid.
What is the point of the continent's gaining political independence only to
sacrifice its economic independence before the altar of the donor community?
Africa's leaders must break free from their aid dependency by harnessing the
continent's collective resources for the benefit of their people. As a critical
step toward this end, African leaders must take pan-African unity seriously and
make real and substantive efforts to harmonize policies.

Premier Li visited AIDS patients, volunteers for AIDS prevention and medical
staff before the 27th World AIDS Day, which falls on Dec 1.

Premier Li Keqiang inspected Beijing You'an Hospital and visited AIDS patients,
volunteers for AIDS prevention and medical staff on Nov 28, just before the 27th
World AIDS Day, which falls on Dec 1 every year.

The hospital is one of the earliest medical institutions offering services for
AIDS patients. It has made outstanding contributions to AIDS epidemiological
investigation, clinical treatment, drug development, medical training,
international cooperation and publicity.

When talking with AIDS patients, experts and representatives of international
organizations at You'an Hospital, the Premier said that the government should
shoulder the major responsibility of fighting AIDS. Li said that the
government's investment into fighting AIDS cannot be reduced.

He said the government must help anti-AIDS organizations cope with the fall in
funding after international organizations pulled back from providing special
funds for AIDS.

The Premier said AIDS patients and their families need more respect and care.
Societal attitudes toward AIDS patients reflects the level of a society's
civilization and progress. The old attitudes of fear surrounding the topic of
AIDS must be abandoned and AIDS patients need more care.

Aid limits

LENGTH: 1062 words

DATELINE: Nepal


Nepal, April 21 -- Nepal has been receiving foreign aid for the last sixty years
and the many projects and programmes implemented through this aid are now
showing good results in infrastructure, irrigation, education, health and
agriculture. While many people have benefited from these programmes, there have
been discussions and debate on whether foreign aid in Nepal has achieved its
intended objectives. So what kind of change has aid brought to Nepal?

Does aid even work?

There are mixed views from around the globe as to whether aid really brings
fruit to any particular country in terms of higher economic growth and poverty
reduction. One line of thought says that there is positive correlation between
aid and growth, but with certain assumptions, namely good governance, good
political environment and a higher ratio of poor people. In other words, aid
works better in relatively poor countries with a strong political leadership and
governance system. Eminent writer Jeffrey Sachs advocates this philosophy.

Another line of thought says that aid does not reduce poverty. Instead, it
creates dependency and encourages corruption. Good governance and a strong
administration are difficult to achieve in poor countries and such countries
lacks the capacity to utilise aid fully. Political interest and the tying up of
aid further aggravates the situation and reduces aid effectiveness. Writer
William Easterly and others champion this line of thought.

However, there are still many more thinkers who believe that that low income
countries in Africa and Asia that have a resource gap need aid, particularly to
develop their infrastructure and build capacity. Certainly, aid works better
even in such countries with good governance and greater political commitment for
development. This third line of thinking still prevails in many developing
countries, including Nepal.

Has aid been effective in Nepal?

Looking at the past sixty years, the general perception is that aid has not
worked well in Nepal. Foreign aid has had little impact on development.
According to many experts, aid has almost failed to achieve higher economic
growth, employment and sustainability. Nepal has utilised aid mostly in the
social sector in the past ten years. The global Millenium Development Goal
targets attracted donors at the global level to the social sector and a
decade-long domestic conflict compelled the national government to use the aid
money for social and community development activities as these
projects/programmes were seen to be more conflict resilient. It was the right
decision in the context of a conflict, as approaching communities helped reduce
poverty to some extent and empower poor people, particularly women. Evidence
shows that there has been much improvement in education and health. However,
utilising aid in the social sector alone does not help induce higher economic
growth and employment, which has been our national development strategy for many
years.

The point here is that we have achieved something from aid but not what we set
out to achieve. Another question is whether to continue with this strategy of
mobilising aid in the social sector. This does not mean that we undermine the
social sector. We need to continue providing resources to health and education
from internal resources. Aid has advantages in the core infrastructure sector
when Nepal is in a normal state. The recently approved Tanahu hydroelectricity
project ($500 million investment in aid money) will be a test project for Nepal,
if we can complete it on time and in cost as planned.

Another feature of the aid industry in Nepal is fragmentation. We have over 500
on-going projects supported by over 40 development partners for less than a
billion dollars in aid money a year. One sector has over 80 aid projects.
Fragmentation is one of the major causes for the low effectiveness of aid in
Nepal.

Capacity constraint is another continuously unresolved issue that development
partners have been raising in Nepal for many years. The motivation to implement
projects in the public sector and public procurement capacity is very low in
Nepal. Frequent changes in key project staff, a flat salary structure and very
few training activities in civil service have caused constraints in aid
management despite the support of donors.

It is the joint responsibility of development partners and the government to
enhance the effectiveness of aid. A "blame game" does not solve the problem.
Equally, by-passing the government is also not a solution to increase
effectiveness.

How to move ahead

The government is currently mobilising aid through the Foreign Aid Policy 2002.
The context has changed now, both internationally and at the national level. The
Principles of Aid Effectiveness from Paris to Busan and historical changes in
Nepal's political and social arenas have made the current policy outdated. The
government has prepared a new foreign aid policy, which is currently under
discussion. Thinking of aid practitioners in Nepal, particularly at the
government level, we need to be selective in utilising aid money across all
sectors. The government has to take on projects in the economic sectors and
relatively larger projects, particularly for economic infrastructure.

Donors obey the host country's systems so we need to find a meeting point with
donors in terms of their engagement and process. It is equally important to
incorporate in the new policy how the government will improve its aid absorption
capacity-its institutions, personnel, systems and processes.

However, a small amount of foreign aid does not have much effect in transforming
the country. We need to stimulate the private sector, together with internal
government resources while applying effective aid management tools. If we need
aid, we also need to be practical and realistic about our capacity.
Sentimentality without being backed by strengths does not help in mobilising
investment. Aid does not come with altruism and aid is not unlimited. It cannot
be used forever andneeds an exit at some point in time. We need to be smart
about how we use aid.

IN ILLINOIS, REACHING OUT TO PEOPLE WHO ARE STILL SHUNNED

AIDS

PEOPLE with AIDS too often must contend with issues such as psychological trauma
and estrangement from their families as well as difficulties in everyday living.
For Madison County residents, however, AIDS Interfaith Response provides a
compassionate and effective support system.

AIDS Interfaith Response began in 1988 when a 7-year-old boy with AIDS was "run
out of Granite City" by residents who feared the child, according to Bobbie
Vandalia, president of the group's board of directors. The Rev. George Humbert,
pastor of Alton's College Avenue Presbyterian Church, and other clergy founded
AIDS Interfaith Response to help the child and his mother find safe lodging in
another Madison County city.

Humbert still counsels people with AIDS and educates area residents about the
disease. Vandalia, who joined AIDS Interfaith Response with her husband, Robert,
in 1989, stresses that the group's role is to provide a support network.

People with AIDS are frequently "shut out by their families, and the only people
they have are us." She noted that some clients have been so shunned by their
relatives that "they have to turn to AIDS Interfaith Response to find someone
who will hug them."

AIDS Interfaith Response has also facilitated heartfelt reunions between people
with AIDS and their families. Vandalia recalled that the group bought a bus
ticket for a father in a distant city so he could come to Alton and visit his
dying son.

While many families appreciate the support that AIDS Interfaith Response gives
their relatives with AIDS, others regard the disease as a shameful stigma.
Vandalia remarked that AIDS Interfaith Response is sometimes not invited to
clients' funerals since families fear the public would then learn that their
relatives had died of AIDS.

ACCORDING to Dr. John R. Luinpkin, director of the Illinois Department of Public
Health, about 23,000 Illinois residents have been diagnosed with AIDS since the
disease was first identified in 1981. Sixty-three percent of them have died.
Between 1987, when AIDS deaths were coded separately, and 1998, 124 Madison
County residents have died of AIDS.

AIDS Interfaith Response often displays its two memorial quilts at fund-raisers
and other public events. Both quilts measure 10 feet by 10 feet, and each
contains 50 distinctively designed patches.

Every patch represents someone who died of AIDS -- 98 percent of them from
Madison County. Last Nov. 30 -- the eve of World AIDS Day -- AIDS Interfaith
Response held its annual memorial service at College Avenue Presbyterian Church.
Those attending were invited to write the names of loved ones lost to AIDS on
flame-shaped slips of paper and then attach them to felt candles already bearing
many such poignant flames. Eight new names were attached that evening.

They will also become part of a third memorial quilt that is already
half-completed.

Betty Marshall, secretary of AIDS Interfaith Response's board of directors,
became involved with the organization out of gratitude for the help it gave her
11-year old grandson, who has AIDS and cerebral palsy. The child needed a
bathtub that was handicapped accessible.

"I called everyone seeking help," Marshall recalled. Only AIDS Interfaith
Response agreed to assist her.

AIDS Interfaith Response also assists people who are experiencing financial
difficulties due to AIDS. Vandalia mentioned that the organization made three
mortgage payments for a client who was too ill to work.

While people with AIDS are now living longer due to recent medical advances,
this epidemic is by no means over.

It disturbs Vandalia that the disease is rising among women, African-Americans,
senior citizens and "young people who think they're immortal."

An organization such as AIDS Interfaith Response belongs in every county.

We have a moral responsibility to assist those whose lives have been disrupted
by this disease.

We also have an obligation to intensify the search for a vaccine to combat AIDS.
The new millennium must include a world in which there is no longer a need for
memorial quilts.

A giant hole in the HIV-Aids hypothesis

BYLINE: Peter Duesberg

SECTION: Features

LENGTH: 1630 words


Aids research is by far the most expensive, yet least productive, programme in
the history of microbe-hunting. But until last month, there was one question
that Aids researchers and the mainstream scientific and non-scientific press
never dared ask: is the human immunodeficiency virus, HIV, really the cause of
Aids?

Last month The Sunday Times published a two-page article confronting the
orthodoxy with my hypothesis that Aids research has failed because Aids may not
be caused by HIV in fact, may not be infectious. I have proposed that in America
and Europe the health breakdown called Aids is primarily due to the long-term
consumption of recreational drugs, and of the anti-viral drug AZT.  Reactions to
the article promoted a small ''alternative'' conference held in Amsterdam this
month into the focus of a prime-time scientific controversy on the cause of
Aids.

The conference was the first to question the dogma that HIV is the cause of
Aids, which is now the exclusive basis for all Aids research, prevention and
therapy. Until last month, all Aids conferences have been ''HIV conferees''
investigating the endless question of how, rather than whether, HIV causes Aids.

But the Amsterdam conference brought together proponents of three schools of
Aids research: the orthodoxy, which holds that HIV alone causes Aids; the
HIV-revisionists, who hold that HIV needs allies to cause Aids; and the
renegades, including me, who hold that HIV is irrelevant for Aids.

Although no consensus emerged, the conference made one point very clear: the
HIV-Aids hypothesis is just that a hypothesis and one that has not been proven
in eight years of unprecedented research efforts that cost billions of dollars.

The hypothesis cannot even predict who gets Aids. If somebody has the ''Aids
virus'', the hypothesis cannot predict whether he or she will get diarrhoea or
dementia, pneumonia or Kaposi's sarcoma.

Although a correct medical hypothesis need not necessarily produce a cure or
prevention, it must be able to predict who is likely to get sick and what
disease it will be. The failure of the HIV-Aids hypothesis to do this is an
infallible indication that it is flawed.

Coming from The Sunday Times and an internationalconference at once, the
challenge could not be ignored. The Aids establishment hit back. Kenneth Calman,
UK chief medical officer, emphatically upheld the faith in the HIV hypothesis in
last week's Sunday Times. Others warned in the same issue that the challenge was
''irresponsible''.

Calman contends that my hypothesis has been ''extensively discussed and refuted
in both the scientific and lay press'', but he failed to point out how and
where. Calman further states ''that the evidence that HIV causes Aids is
overwhelming'', but he did not cite one paper. Instead he cites circumstantial
evidence, namely that ''whenever Aids has appeared ... HIV arrived first''.

He is perhaps more right on this latter point than he anticipated, though not in
a way that proves any connection between the two events. HIV almost certainly
arrived in the United States hundreds of years ago with immigrants, while Aids
followed only in the 1980s, when we saw the consequences of an explosion in drug
use unprecedented in human populations.

A well-established principle in biology, known as Farr's law, holds that a
microbe's age is determined by changes in its incidence over time. Ever since
1985, when HIV became detectable, a remarkably constant 1m (0.4%) Americans have
been infected with HIV. The figure is so steady that it is safe to conclude HIV
has long been established in America.

Further, Calman argues that ''long-term studies of homosexual men and
haemophiliacs show that Aids develops only in those who are infected with HIV''.
In fact, this is merely a restatement of the Aids definition, because Aids is
defined exclusively by the combination of HIV and one of 25 previously known
diseases. That does not prove HIV causes Aids.

On the contrary, about 15,000 (75%) of American haemophiliacs carry HIV, the
result of transfusions received before 1985, but their media age has doubled
during the past 10-15 years. Even taking into account that their treatments may
have improved, this is hardly an argument for viewing HIV as a deadly virus
sweeping those infected to an early death.

For his claim that only homosexual men with HIV get Aids, and not those who
remain uninfected, Calman refers to Roel Coutinho and his colleagues from
Amsterdam. They made this claim at the conference, where they also asserted that
toxic sexual stimulants such as amyl nitrite inhalants (''poppers'') and cocaine
are not relevant Aids risks.

But I have checked Coutinho's studies, published in the American Journal of
Epidemiology in 1987 and 1990. They did not include a control group for testing
the relevance of drugs to Aids; that is, a group of homosexuals free of HIV but
matched with the HIV-positive group for use of poppers and cocaine. Thus Calman
was mistaken in assuming that Coutinho had compared the fate of those infected
by HIV to uninfected controls.

In fact, the drugs link is present in Coutinho's work, but he fails to see its
significance. His 1987 paper reports that the use of sexual stimulants put these
men at risk for HIV infection, and thus for Aids, according to his hypothesis.
But a virus can hardly discriminate between a human host using drugs and one
that is not. In my view, the true interpretation of these data is that long-term
drug consumption causes the diseases that we are calling Aids when HIV is
present. If no HIV is found, the diseases are called by their old names.

The HIV revisionists in Amsterdam, as for example Montagnier, and now Calman,
try to save the sagging HIV hypothesis with a bewildering list of hypothetical
''co-factors'', including microbes such as mycoplasma and other viruses, and
indirect disease mechanisms.

The most popular of these ersatz HIV hypotheses postulates that HIV confuses the
immune system into reacting against itself (autoimmunity) or persuades the
immune system to commit suicide (apoptosis). But no reasons are provided why HIV
would do this almost only to men (90% of all American and European Aids patients
are males), and only to intravenous drug users, homosexuals and haemophiliacs
(97% of all Aids patients), and then only on average 10 years after infection
(the presumed time from infection to Aids).  Nor do these new ideas explain why
HIV would cause Kaposi's sarcoma only in homosexuals and tuberculosis
preferentially in intravenous drug users.

For these reasons the HIV renegades have crossed the HIV Rubicon, pointing out
that Aids is not compatible with any known infectious disease. All infectious
diseases, without exception:

Do not discriminate between men and women but Aids is 90% male.

Strike within days or weeks after infection, because microbes are
self-replicating toxins but Aids is said to follow only 10 years after HIV
infection.

Are cured by antiviralmicrobial immunity but Aids is said to occur long after
the ''Aids virus'' has been neutralised by antibodies, as detected by the ''Aids
test''.

If Aids is not infectious, it must be caused by non-infectious agents. In
American and European Aids these are easy to find: 33% of the patients are
intravenous drug users, and the male homosexuals who develop Aids have nearly
all been long-term consumers of toxic sexual stimulants. Even Coutinho reports
that the homosexual men in his studies, whose only Aids risk was said to be HIV,
had all used such drugs at least once a month.

Drugs explain all peculiarities of Aids:

The disease is 90% male, because males consume 90% of psychoactive drugs.

Recreational drugs take years to cause disease, just as smoking takes years to
cause lung cancer.

Different drugs cause different diseases. Poppers, used exclusively by male
homosexuals, cause Kaposi's sarcoma; smoking crack causes pneumonia and
tuberculosis; AZT, because of its toxicity for immune-system cells and red blood
cells, is Aids by prescription.

Now the HIV question is out of the closet, what are the consequences for Aids
patients and Aids research? Can we afford further ''Aids testing'' if HIV is not
a proven cause of Aids, if Aids may not even be infectious? A positive Aids test
measures antibodies against a virus, the classic

defence against viral disease but it is now being perceived as a prognosis for
death! This in itself is psychologically toxic, a prophecy that can become
self-fulfilling when made by today's medical ''high priests''.

Worse than that, a positive test is taken as an indication for the inevitably
toxic AZT therapy. AZT was originally developed to kill human cancer cells and
is now marketed as an antiviral drug. It is both, indeed, but it is about
100,000 times more effective in killing human cells than in killing HIV, because
the DNA of human cells is 100,000 times larger than that of HIV and AZT is just
a terminator of DNA synthesis.

What could be done to open up Aids research for alternative views? The greatest
obstacle to an open Aids research strategy is its abundant governmental and
commercial support, craing a huge orthodoxy of researchers, industrialists and
activists whose only claim to fame and funding is HIV.  Alternative Aids
research would also generate a problem for the biotechnology lobby that markets
Aids test kits and AZT.

In their quest to solve Aids, the HIV-dissidents have at least one formidable
ally, which grows stronger every day: the complete and consistent failure of the
Aids orthodoxy to produce a single clinically useful result.

Stop lining crooks' pockets;
Monday's budget may increase foreign aid - but;
it's money wasted if we don't stop funding;
corrupt regimes, says analyst DANIELLE GOLDFARB

Bangladesh is the top recipient of Canada's long-term development aid. It also
has the dubious distinction of occupying the top spot on watchdog organization
Transparency International's corruption scale. Other top aid recipients, such as
Indonesia and Pakistan, also rank near the top of the scale. Not coincidentally,
these countries have unimpressive growth rates in average incomes.

Giving aid to highly corrupt countries does little for their poor and is
unlikely to increase support for foreign aid among Canadians. Even when donors
fund schools and hospitals directly, local governments might then spend less on
these things, with more public money being diverted to guns, officials' villas,
and secret bank accounts.

Yet, when the C. D. Howe Institute published a study last week highlighting the
tendency for more Canadian development aid to flow to more corrupt countries,
Maria Minna, the minister responsible for the Canadian International Development
Agency (CIDA), shrugged off the finding on the grounds that corruption is
pervasive.

Ottawa has promised to increase foreign aid in next week's budget. But instead
of distributing aid according to historical patterns, the government should be
targeting countries that are both poor and relatively well managed. Aid should
serve as a lever to improve the quality of government in countries that have the
political will to change.

The fact that the most corrupt countries get the most aid does not mean that
CIDA deliberately gives more aid to the more corrupt countries. But it does
suggest that CIDA fails to allocate aid carefully among recipients. In 1999-2000
Canada gave $2.7-billion in aid to more than 130 countries in Africa, the Middle
East, Asia, Latin America, and even Europe (former Soviet republics are also aid
recipients). In other words, Canada disperses aid indiscriminately to almost
every developing country in the world.

This scattershot approach is, however, an anomaly among other relatively small
aid donors. Australia, for example, concentrates its aid on the Far East and
Papua-New Guinea, while the Netherlands focuses aid on 17 poor countries that it
considers "well-governed."

How effective is Canada's aid distribution? Research by the World Bank shows
that, when bureaucracies are competent, corruption is controlled, and legal and
political institutions are strong, aid has a significantly positive impact on
average incomes and social indicators such as infant mortality. By contrast,
when aid goes to countries where bribery, nepotism, fraud, and money laundering
are widespread and where governments are not accountable to their citizens, aid
has no impact.

High levels of corruption make it easier for government officials to divert
resources from, say, rural health clinics specializing in preventive care and
toward large defence contracts, which are easier to manipulate. Worse, because
extra aid increases the incentive for corrupt officials to grab it, higher
levels of aid to highly corrupt countries can actually fuel corruption and make
governments less effective.

It has been suggested that donors can make aid work, even where governments are
highly corrupt, by stipulating that recipients use aid for a specific purpose,
by giving aid in-kind, or by making more extensive use of non-governmental
organizations (NGOs). But the idea that donors can micromanage aid in countries
with unaccountable, corrupt governments may be largely illusory.

Funding governments and NGOs in poor countries to build, say, schools, frees up
more resources for other purposes. Where governments are not held accountable,
these "free" resources tend to be used for ends that have little to do with
development. Bangladesh, which gets half its revenue from aid, bought eight
second-hand Russian fighter planes last year.

Ms. Minna has promised a "firm plan for a more effective Canadian aid program"
in the new year. She should seize this opportunity to rethink Canada's aid
strategy. Since development is a complex process, there are no appropriate
hard-and-fast decision rules for CIDA to use. But here are a few guidelines.

A good first step would be to increase the profile of the corruption issue
within aid programs. Although CIDA's programming now places greater emphasis on
improving the quality of government, corruption is not yet a priority. Aid
policy documents, in fact, gloss over the issue. A recent CIDA paper on
strengthening aid effectiveness, intended as a basis for a more effective aid
plan, briefly discusses the importance of a well-run country but mentions
corruption only twice, and only in passing.

As a next step, CIDA could make corruption in potential recipient countries a
key criterion in aid-granting decisions - when choosing among equally poor
countries, Canada should target the least corrupt. Also targeted should be those
countries that have both the capacity and the political will to change.

Canadian aid should emphasize activities that discourage corruption and improve
government accountability. Where humanitarian imperatives make it necessary to
provide aid to countries with highly corrupt governments, CIDA could instead
fund uncorrupt institutions, such as universities, to improve the quality of
information and public debate. Better informed citizens are better able to hold
their governments accountable.

As a relatively small aid donor, Canada needs to focus its aid if it expects to
effect change. It will be difficult to redistribute aid, especially for such a
politically sensitive reason as corruption. But a CIDA that is insufficiently
attentive to corruption and the importance of good government in aid recipients
will fail to build a political consensus within Canada to sustain the program,
and it will fail to help the poor.
Danielle Goldfarb, a policy analyst at the C. D. Howe Institute, is the author

Development Aid, available at www.cdhowe.org.

Westchester Q&A: Sandra Solomon;
Refining Hearing With Digital Aids

BYLINE: By DONNA GREENE

SECTION: Section 13WC; Page 3; Column 1; Westchester Weekly Desk

LENGTH: 1310 words


WHAT computers have done for seemingly everything else in life --
revolutionizing the way things are done -- they are now doing for the hearing
aid. Sandra Solomon, a White Plains audiologist, said that newfangled, digital
hearing aids are flexible, reprogrammable to meet changing needs and are far
quieter than traditional analog hearing aids.

Since 1991, Ms. Solomon, formerly on the staff of the Speech and Audiology
Department at the Burke Rehabilitation Hospital in White Plains, has been in
private practice in audiology with her partner, Rochelle Shotland, with offices
at Burke.

An estimated 25 million Americans suffer some hearing loss and about 5 million
wear a hearing aid. Far more should but do not for a variety of reasons, Ms.
Solomon said. Here are excerpts from a recent conversation with Ms. Solomon:

Q. Is significant hearing loss inevitable as part of the aging process?

A. Hearing loss does go along with the aging process, but it depends on your
genetics. Some people can be 90 and not have a hearing loss. And hearing loss
spans a lot of ages and can affect infants, children or adults of all ages. Some
factors include a mother's illness during pregnancy, such as rubella, family
history of progressive hearing loss or chronic ear infections in childhood as
well as certain diseases. In adults, excessive wax is a common cause but a
treatable condition. Other conditions are prolonged and sudden exposure to loud
noise.

Q. What is this new technology and why is it so significant?

A. In a digital hearing aid, the "brain" of the hearing aid is the digital audio
processor. There are micro chips in this digital hearing aid as well as a
miniature microphone, miniature loudspeaker and miniature battery. The digital
hearing aid is digitally programmed on a computer, and the sound is digitally
processed. We compare it to the sound processing of a CD in a CD player. Because
this hearing aid is fully digital and has this digital sound processing, we have
the ability to program it to meet unique individual hearing needs. And once it
is set, the processor automatically adjusts to changing sounds and surroundings.
This results in a highly personalized hearing aid that we feel improves speech
perception in different listening environments.

But it's very important to understand that no hearing aid can restore your
hearing to absolute normal. Hearing aids are aids. They're not miracles, but
they do help people tremendously. And children with a hearing problem obviously
need hearing aids to learn. For people in a job situation, getting a hearing aid
can mean keeping a job or losing it. There have been studies that show that
people wait 8 to 10 years before seeking help after the onset of hearing loss.

Q. Why do you think that happens?

A. There are lots of reasons. Some of it is denial; people minimize the effect
the hearing loss has on their life. Also, hearing loss is associated with the
aging process. Our culture glamorizes youth. But as a result, they miss
conversation, become more isolated, and the things I said before. And as I tell
my patients, when you start missing things that are said, people start thinking
there is something wrong with you cognitively, that you're getting senile, when
really it's due to your hearing loss. It's very important that people are
counseled properly. Another thing is older people don't like change. They say
it's too hard.

Q. Why are these digital hearing aids better than traditional ones?

A. There are many advantages of the digital hearing aid over the other hearing
aids, which are called analog hearing aids. We look at hearing loss like a
fingerprint. No two hearing losses are the same. These little chips in these
digital hearing aids have the capability of processing sound millions of times
per second. These hearing aids are constantly processing sound. Because of this
digital technology in the hearing aid, the digital hearing aid has an infinite
number of parameters that can be adjusted. So this allows for much greater
flexibility and much more process fitting of individual hearing losses.

Q. You would then tell the computer, for example, what an individual's problems
are, and it would make the proper adjustment?

A. What we do is we put the hearing loss into the computer, and the computer
comes up with various algorithms or settings. And then we hook the hearing aid
up to the computer with cables and batteries, and we put that program into the
hearing aid. So we're programming the hearing aid for the individual.

All programmable hearing aids -- and there are also analog hearing aids that are
programmable -- can be reprogrammed as hearing loss changes. So you don't have
to buy a new hearing aid. Also, with these hearing aids, as generations of new
software are developed, then we can hook the person to the computer and take
advantage of new options. The flexibility is terrific.

Another thing -- and this is very important -- that digital hearing aids do is
that they automatically adjust to changing sound environments. They also
automatically amplify soft sounds and turn down loud sounds. With some of the
older hearing aids, people are very bothered by loud sounds. The digital hearing
aids eliminate the need for a volume control on the hearing aid or a remote
volume control. This is really an advantage for children and for the elderly. A
lot of the elderly say hearing aids are too much trouble. These digital hearing
aids are simple. You just turn them on by closing the battery door and put them
in your ear.

These hearing aids are also much quieter. A lot of people who have mild hearing
loss put a hearing aid on, and they say, "It's so noisy," because other hearing
aids have more circuit noise. These hearing aids are very, very quiet. They can
amplify very soft sounds with very little circuit noise. These are excellent
hearing aids for people who have mild hearing loss. These hearing aids are also
less susceptible to interference and distortion.

Q. How small is this hearing aid?

A. The hearing aid runs in different sizes. There are only two companies now
that have 100 percent digital hearing aids out: one is Widex, and one is Oticon,
both Danish companies with manufacturing plants in the United States. More and
more companies are going to come out with this. One of the companies is coming
out with one that goes completely in the ear canal, very small; there are also
larger ones and behind-the-ear ones. They do range in all different sizes.

Q. I assume a lot of patients are self-conscious and don't want anything
showing?

A. Except we really try and counsel people and make people understand that they
put on eyeglasses, why should this be different? But unfortunately, there is a
stigma associated with hearing aids. We need to educate the public that there is
no big deal to wear a hearing aid. The most important thing is that they be able
to communicate.

Q. What are the disadvantages, if any?

A. Disadvantages? There really are no disadvantages except that they cost more.
Analog hearing aids cost about $700 and up. Some of the programmable hearing
aids sell for more than $2,000. But people have to start thinking about
investing in their hearing. They have to think about how it can improve the
quality of their life. If, for the elderly, they're not hearing their
grandchildren they're missing out. People with hearing loss who don't do
anything about it, start to isolate themselves and stop going to social
functions, religious services. In a family situation they sit back and don't
participate. They're missing so much. They're tired of saying, "What did you
say?" and the family gets tired of repeating things.

And these digital hearing aids are for people with mild to severe hearing loss;
as of yet, they are not appropriate for people with profound hearing loss.

Australian overseas aid seen to be less effective

BYLINE: The Canberra Times

SECTION: A; Pg. B004

LENGTH: 773  words


Australian overseas aid seen to be less effective Results from a 2015 aid
stakeholder survey reveal some important policy implications, write Terence
Wood, Camilla Burkot and Stephen Howes.

T he last few years have heralded significant changes to Australia's foreign aid
program. The standalone aid agency, AusAID, was integrated into the Department
of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The aid budget faced the largest cuts ever in its
history.

These changes have not been without consequence and a new survey of almost 500
aid experts and practitioners points to the serious risks now facing the
Australian aid program.

The 2015 Australian Aid Stakeholder Survey is the second such survey of
Australian aid experts and practitioners undertaken by aid think-tank, the
Development Policy Centre, based at The Australian National University. The
first survey was held in 2013, prior to the integration of AusAID and the large
aid cuts. The second survey was carried out in the second half of 2015.

The survey was targeted at those who are most knowledgeable about the Australian
aid program: the leaders of NGOs and businesses who implement the aid program,
as well as government officials and academics interested in aid.

The results do contain some good news for the aid program. In particular, the
majority of stakeholders continue to believe that Australian aid is effective.
But this view is not as widely shared as in 2013. And, whereas in 2013 most
stakeholders thought the effectiveness of our aid was improving, now most think
it is worsening. The majority now rate Australian aid as less effective than aid
from the average Western donor, again a reversal from 2013.

Some of the increased dissatisfaction is due to the massive budget cuts of 2015.

Funding predictability is now viewed as the biggest weakness of Australian aid.

But the survey results also make it clear that the concerns of stakeholders are
not just about the budget. Stakeholders perceive a loss of strategic clarity,
and a reduced emphasis on helping the poor versus an increased emphasis on
Australia's own interests.

About three quarters of respondents view staff expertise as a weakness of the
aid program - up from half in 2013 - and say that the merger with DFAT has had a
negative impact on aid staff effectiveness.

Transparency and community engagement have gone from being strengths of the aid
program to weaknesses. In 2013, only one quarter of respondents saw aid
transparency as a weakness. Now three quarters do. These results have some
important policy implications. While some of these areas are ones where we do
see progress (there is noticeably more aid information on the DFAT website in
recent months), clearly much more is needed.

First and foremost, further aid cuts scheduled for this year (an additional $224
million) should be averted, not least because they will play further havoc with
funding predictability. The government needs to convince the Australian public
that aid is still primarily about helping poor people in developing countries.

The Department of Foreign Affairs should replenish the stocks of aid expertise
that were severely depleted by the large number of AusAID staff leaving in the
wake of the merger, and make it easier for its staff to specialise in aid policy
and management, a complex area with its own demanding requirements of skill and
experience.

The government needs to come up with a new aid Transparency Charter - like the
one we had back in 2011, but which has since been allowed to languish - and hold
itself accountable to the standards set by it.

Finally, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop and newly-appointed Minister for
International Development and the Pacific Steven Ciobo must do more to
communicate to the public the importance and successes of the Australian aid
program.

Our aid stakeholder survey is proving to be a useful tool for accountability and
learning, and we plan to implement the survey again in another two years.

Overall, the survey provides valuable and constructive feedback to the
government on what it needs to do to restore confidence in, and improve the
effectiveness of, Australian aid.

Those surveyed are those trusted to implement the Australian aid program. Their
warnings should be heeded.

Dr Terence Wood is a research fellow, Camilla Burkot a research officer, and
Professor Stephen Howes the director of the Development Policy Centre, Crawford
School of Public Policy, The Australian National University. The full survey
report, Australian aid: signs of risk - the 2015 Australian aid stakeholder
survey, will be launched at the 2016 Australasian aid conference at ANU on
Thursday, February 11.

Aid money is not helping the world's poor;
Troubles in Solomon Islands and other countries in the region prompt questions
of whether our aid actually works and if not, why not, says Pierre Huetter.

SECTION: A; Pg. 23

LENGTH: 1494 words


THE AUSTRALIAN Strategic Policy Institute this week released a report entitled
'Our failing neighbour: Australia and the future of Solomon Islands', which
describes the problems and possible solutions to the collapse of government and
break down of society in the Solomon Islands. It states plainly that more aid
won't fix their problems and could in fact make them worse.

This simple assertion defies conventional thinking on development assistance.
Most people think development assistance is an altruistic contribution to poor
countries. How can it be bad? But there are several voices who have been
claiming aid's ill effects for a long time, such as Helen Hughes of the
Australian National University.

The collapse of the Solomon Islands and similar trends in other countries in the
'arc of instability' provide a timely prompt to consider whether our aid
actually works, and if not, why. And surprisingly the issue of whether
development aid (as opposed to more specific humanitarian aid) actually helps
poor peoples is alarmingly questionable.

If we look at the track record of aid, we find that it is unimpressive. Had
global aid since 1950 been invested in US treasury bonds, the cumulative assets
of developing countries would now be $3.5 trillion, earning interest in
perpetuity. In stark contrast is the global reality. If you exclude India and
China, global poverty is at an all-time high and most of the countries that
received the aid mentioned above are heavily indebted and dependent on donor
aid. Global development aid grew steadily from 1950 until the mid 1990s while
the vast majority of poor countries stayed poor. A history of aid to sub-Saharan
Africa reveals that economic growth, the main driver of development, has
declined as aid has increased. That is, the more aid, the more poverty.

Interesting also are the sizes of the development bureaucracies. The World
Bank's administrative expenses went from $120 million in 1959-60 to $2.3 billion
in 1993-94 (in 1993 dollars). In the same period its staff went from 657 to
7106. In 1997 Australia's Agency for International Development (AusAID), whose
growth would reflect that of other development agencies, had 555 staff plus 170
overseas staff. These figures don't include the panoply of staff in profit and
non-profit organisations which exist on AusAID funding.

Proponents of increased aid might argue that aid does work and might cite the
examples of China or India, where much of the success in global poverty
reduction has occurred. Aid's role in the development success of these countries
is questionable, however. Per capita they have received and continue to receive
very small amounts of aid, about $2.30 per capita in 2000, whereas sub-Saharan
Africa, which has received a massive amount of aid over sustained periods,
receives roughly 13 times more aid per capita, $30 per capita, as it stagnates.

Closer to home, Australia has spent $15.9 billion on aid to Papua New Guinea
since independence. In that period economic growth has been minimal and the
standard of living in PNG has broadly deteriorated. Since 1970 the Solomon
Islands has received an annual average of $170 per capita in aid, while the
Pacific as a whole has received annually $335 per capita in aid.

Bureaucracies are not being held accountable.

A landmark study of aid effectiveness published in 1998 by the United Nations
Development Program found that there was no clear link between aid and economic
growth. It did find aid seemed to work better when the governments of recipient
countries were already effective. Recent research suggests that even this link
is questionable.

The Millennium Development Goals agreed by the UN General Assembly in 2000, have
set development targets for the wealthy and poor nations of the world. They
include halving the number of people living in absolute poverty and achieving
universal primary education.

The goals are useful for several reasons. Most importantly, they set hard
targets within a rigid timeframe, something never done before. This is
definitely a step towards worthwhile action.

Secondly, the goals build some accountability into aid. If targets are not
reached, both the wealthy and poor nations have a set of benchmarks with which
to hold each other accountable for their efforts. Surprisingly, this is a
relatively new phenomenon. Big aid dollars have been flowing for years
regardless of results.

Thirdly, the setting of the goals implicitly acknowledges an open secret aid has
failed to nurture development. The fact that hard targets within a set timeframe
are needed suggests their absence for the past 50 years has undermined aid. OECD
governments, in gradually winding back their aid relative to GDP, have
implicitly acknowledged this secret for a decade. And Australia is not alone in
doing this.

It is important to acknowledge aid failure because if wealthy nations are to
actually help poor countries, in contrast with efforts to date, they need to
address their mistakes. The current denial of failure implicit in much
development thinking is what is limiting aid's effectiveness and undermining
development. Essentially, development assistance bureaucracies are not being
held accountable for the lack of development.

To illustrate, imagine the Australian government wanted to improve literacy in
children in certain areas of Australia. The Government would commit resources
and set targets. If, in three or five years, literacy in the relevant groups had
dropped or stayed the same, it is inconceivable that the Government would not
cut the program or at least dramatically change it. In aid however, this is
exactly what has happened.

Similarly in the Solomon Islands, Australia has been a long standing major aid
donor contributing a substantial part of its $165 per capita in aid. The return
on the investment is a Government so corrupt and depleted that Australia is
considering sending in troops to bring stability.

Mountains of aid money have been spent assisting poor countries. They haven't
improved, and the money has kept flowing. Understanding this peculiar enthusiasm
to waste money is challenging, until you look at the multiple roles that aid
serves. Most aid bureaucracies claim to serve primarily the interests of the
poor. If they did, they would have been overhauled when their failure became
apparent . . . perhaps in the 1960s.

Aid is altruistic help. But aid is also a foreign-policy tool, a paternalistic
subsidy for the development industry, a missionary's tool, a beach-head of
national pride, and a salve for the wealthy's conscience. Aid is many things but
its continuation in the face of failure alludes to its multiple
'non-development' roles.

We can afford to allow aid to fail because it succeeds in its other role of
buying influence, making us feel altruistic, spreading Australia's vision of
democracy abroad and building up Australian industry.

This situation has been acceptable for Australia in the recent past. The winners
from this situation Australia's foreign policy, Australia's conscience,
Australian prestige and pride, the development industries (NGOs, AusAID,
development firms and contractors) are busy and prosperous in the belief that
they are on the whole contributing to Australian and global betterment. The
problem is that these gains have been short term. In the longer term, aid
failure is unsustainable because of the costs it imposes down the track.

A quick glance at the Solomons and our neighbourhood 'arc of instability'
confirms that development failure threatens Australia on many fronts in the
future. Aid efforts of the past 20 years have maintained short-term stability
and influence at the cost of long-term stability and development. Our
willingness to accept aid failure in terms of development has contributed
substantially to the 'arc of instability'.

A corrosive deadweight to poor countries.

The route to achieving the Millennium Development Goals therefore is not more
aid, but making aid actually work. Aid failure should be the big issue in aid.

Assisting poor nations develop is an infinitely complex task, especially in the
nations that can't seem to make a start towards development. There are no easy
solutions and development aid is only one of several assistance tools. Any
partial solutions we could devise would undoubtedly bring a new set of problems.
But aid does have a role in nurturing development, as well as a profound
responsibility. Aid can be effective.

Aid can be a leg up, but until we face up to the duplicitous flaws it is more
likely to be a corrosive deadweight to poor countries. We must come to terms
with this before we can hope to really help.

We need to open our eyes and sharpen up our act.

development assistance. pierrehuetter@hotmail.com

Aids test row erupts State AMA chief calls for compulsory checks By DEBORAH
TIDEMAN COMPULSORY Aids tests for all Tasmanian hospital patients were urged by
the Australian Medical Association's state secretary yesterday.

"Every patient should be regarded as a potential and hostile threat," said Dr
Bryan Walpole.

But his call was immediately criticised by the head of one of the state's
leading private hospitals.

"It would be considered an invasion and offence by a lot of people," said the
acting director of Hobart's St Helen's Hospital, Mr Darryl Talbot.

Dr Walpole said compulsory testing was the only way to combat the small but
significant risk of spread of Aids to patients and staff.

The tests would also help prevent the spread of Aids to the heterosexual
community.

His comments follow a move by Melbourne's private Freemasons Hospital to refuse
surgery to people with Aids, or who carry the Aids virus.

The decision outraged Aids experts and hospital unions, but received support
from some doctors groups who say there is still much that is unknown about the
virus.

The federal AMA vice-president, Dr Bruce Shepherd, said it was now known that
the Aids virus could exist for a week in a dry environment - and could even be
inhaled through a surgeon's mask.

He called for a national doctors' summit on the issue.

The Australian Association of Surgeons also called for testing patients before
surgery.

And the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons recently issued new guidelines
saying surgeons should refuse to perform elective surgery if patients withhold
consent for an Aids test.

Dr Walpole said he hoped compulsory tests would be brought into Tasmania soon.
However, he did not support banning Aids patients.

"We just need to identify them [Aids patients] so we can take precautions," he
said.

He said it was the only chance to halt the spread of Aids from homosexuals and
IV drug users to the heterosexual community.

Dr Walpole also said the threat to staff and patients had not been fully
recognised.

"We were told four to five years ago that it was practically impossible to
contract Aids by accident," he said.

"But about 20-30 hospital staff worldwide have caught Aids from patients." He
said government policies, aimed at not discriminating against Aids patients,
were failing to identify them, placing patients and staff at an unacceptable
risk.

The Melbourne hospital's ban has brought a warning from the Equal Opportunity
Commission that it might be illegal.

Despite a prediction from Dr Shepherd that other private hospitals would follow
the lead, at St Helen's Mr Talbot described the compulsory testing plan as
costly and impractical.

He said Aids patients at St Helen's would be treated like any other patient with
an infectious disease - and sent to the Royal Hobart Hospital where there were
appropriate facilities.

"But if it is not known if a patient has Aids then obviously Continued Page 2
Editorial: Page 8 Row erupts on Aids tests they would be admitted," he said.

Mr Talbot said there was only a "miniscule" risk of contracting Aids.

"Hepatitis B is much more of a problem than Aids," he said.

The chief executive officer of St John's Private Hospital, Mr Michael Wright,
said banning patients would be "the exception rather than the rule".

He said the hospital was developing a protocol for treatment of Aids patients.

He defended the right of private hospitals to ban Aids patients, and did not
rule it out as possible action.

"Private hospitals have the right to refuse anybody, be they Aids patients or
anybody else," he said.

But he said he would encourage staff to be receptive to treating Aids sufferers.

"We cannot say categorically that we will accept all Aids patients," he said.

"But in the majority of incidents we will not turn away Aids patients.

"It will be the exception rather than the rule." Mr Wright said a staff survey
was being circulated around the hospital to canvas ideas on the admission and
treatment of Aids patients, because of the "inevitability" that an Aids patient
will be admitted to the hospital.

"Aids will not dissipate, it will only increase, and we have to come to terms
with that," he said.

Calvary Hospital also plans to treat admission of Aids patients like sufferers
of any infectious disease.

The hospital's sister administrator, Sr Julianna Coulson, said admitting an Aids
patient was up to the doctor, and depended on facilities for care.

"There is no greater risk with Aids if proper precautions are taken," she said.

St Vincent's Hospital in Launceston said they would welcome Aids sufferers.

North-West Private Hospital in Burnie said the hospital did not have a policy
against Aids patients. St Luke's in Launceston refused to comment.

Meanwhile, the Federal Minister for Health, Dr Neal Blewett, yesterday moved to
allay fears that hospital workers and patients were at risk of catching the Aids
virus.

He said hospital workers had legitimate concerns about coming into contact with
the Aids virus, but that the issue had been addressed by the Aids Task Force.

Infection control guidelines, drawn up by the Task Force last year and
distributed to all hospitals, made the risk of transmission to staff and
patients neglible, he said.

There were no known cases of a patient or health care worker being infected with
the Aids virus in an Australian hospital, said Dr Blewett.

"However, implementation of the infection control guidelines recommended by the
Task Force is essential for all institutions to ensure that this record is
maintained.

"Indeed, any hospital which fails to take these simple precautions believing
that a ban on admissions of people with the virus is logical or achievable could
well be putting staff at risk through an attitude of complacency," he added.

LEGAL AID A 'MYSTERY' TO LAWYERS

Working knowledge "not good' LEGAL AID A "MYSTERY' TO LAWYERS By DOUG BUTTON
Many lawyers did not have a good working knowledge of the legal aid system,
placing hundreds of applicants at a disadvantage, a survey has found.

The two-year survey also found some lawyers breached legal aid requirements by
withholding applications.

Other lawyers fought with Legal Aid Commission staff, 10 percent of them saying
the staff sometimes were rude and hostile.

The findings were issued in An Evaluation of the Legal Aid Office (Queensland).

The Legal Aid Office opened in Brisbane in 1978.

Branch offices have since opened at Cairns, Townsville, Southport, Ipswich,
Inala, Woodridge, Mackay and Rockhampton.

applicant is outside the guidelines.Means test Nearly 20 percent of solicitors
were unaware the Legal Aid Office had sole discretion.

The survey said most solicitors knew clients had to pass a means and a merit
test to qualify.

But some lawyers were confused about clients' eligibility.

The survey said: ""Since a majority of clients in the survey said they were
advised about legal aid by their solicitor it would seem a solicitor's reliance
on clients to initiate discussion about legal aid is misplaced.

""In fact, evidence shows clients do not generally have information about legal
aid.

""Clients rely on the discretionary judgments of the solicitors."

The survey found 17 percent of solicitors never made an application for legal
aid if it appeared their client was outside the guidelines.Opportunity In this
case, not only was the client prevented from having his case considered, but the
client also missed out on the opportunity to have his application reconsidered.

The survey found: ""These results support previous findings that applicants may
be at a disadvantage, given that they have to rely on their solicitor's
knowledge of legal aid in the first place.Limited ""If the solicitor's knowledge
is limited, so too is the client's.

""Surveyors found 88 percent of solicitors considering legal aid for clients had
a social conscience.

However, 21 percent of solicitors said legal aid clients were more demanding
while another 14 percent said legal aid clients required solicitors to be
economical as well as professional.Reward Some 13 percent of solicitors believed
legal aid clients took them for granted and almost as many others said legal aid
required more work for less financial reward.

The survey results showed that beyond a general knowledge of legal aid, many
lawyers did not have a working knowledge of its administration.

While 96 percent of lawyers knew the legal aid office employed its own lawyers,
only 28 percent knew social workers were also employed.

According to the survey 6 percent of solicitors erroneously believed the legal
aid office employed psychologists and half of all solicitors did not know.

Only 8 percent of solicitors said the legal aid staff were co-operative, while 5
percent found the staff excessively bureaucratic and 43 percent found this so
sometimes.

Possible alternatives for Pakistan to channel foreign aid

LENGTH: 747  words


The West has spent $2.3 trillion on foreign aid over the last five decades and
has not managed to "get 12-cent medicines to children to prevent half of all
malaria deaths, or $3 to each new mother to prevent 5 million child deaths,"
writes William Easterly, the author of "The White Man's Burden: How the West's
Efforts to Aid the Rest Have Done So Much Ill and So Little Good".

Easterly believes that economic development comes, not through aid, but through
home-grown efforts of entrepreneurs and social and political reformers. It could
also be added that strengthening of the civil society also helps in economic
development.

Punjab seeks Rs115b foreign aid for mega project

Criticisms on government-to-government foreign aid can be divided into two
groups. One group rests its claim on the technical evaluation of aid programmes,
thus raising doubts about the efficacy of foreign aid, especially in relation to
poverty reduction.

This group makes recommendations for improving the programme design and
accountability mechanisms, but it accepts the basic paradigm of foreign aid that
the poor need external help. This is aid managerialism.

The other group criticises foreign aid in terms of its probable use as a
leverage to extend influence on the domestic policy of developing countries.
This group raises fundamental questions about how the aid is structured and
relates it with what they call a neo-imperialist agenda.

In most cases, 75% of aid money goes back to donor countries in the form of
contracts and supply of goods. Governments are often engaged in a turf war when
negotiating the terms of engagement with foreign aid agencies.

The currently enforced Foreign Contributions Act 2015 in Pakistan links the use
of foreign aid with transactional approval from the Economic Affairs Division.
This is aid politics.

The politics of US aid to Pakistan

There are important actors in foreign aid the aid professionals, consultants,
evaluators and international and local contractors. They associate themselves
with governments, the civil society and donors.

More often than not, they broker the flow of aid between donors and recipients
by preparing programmes, proposals and projects. Their interest obviously lies
in expanding foreign aid. This is aid business.

Problems

The problem with the first argument aid managerialism is that it may end up
demanding more foreign aid and just like any failed government programme it gets
more budget. This just feeds into the foreign aid cycle and increases the cost
of fundamental change.

The problem with the second argument aid politics is that it may deny external
resources when and where they are needed the most, especially for meeting
challenges of the on-going humanitarian crisis including disaster preparedness
and mitigation.

This argument also increases the risk of government's increased control in the
recipient country, which in turn could be utilised to further a government
head's undemocratic ambitions.

Possible remedy

An alternative scenario, a hypothetical one, can be considered in which there is
no government-to-government foreign aid. In such a scenario, the recipient
government declares a ban on foreign aid for publicly funded programmes and
departments such as public education and health.

Instead, it creates channels and mechanisms where foreign aid can flow directly
to the civil society, NGOs, private sector and philanthropic organisations,
serving the same purpose of public goods delivery, albeit in a much more
cost-effective manner.

Slowdown in foreign aid inflow

An immediate consequence of this ban will be a fundamental change in
inter-governmental relationships altering the power structure. At the same time,
it will keep donor countries committed to the Sustainable Development Goals.
This is aid globalism.

Altering the foreign aid equation by this fundamental shift will strengthen the
civil society and private institutions, which will also bring a positive change
to social and political structures in the recipient countries.

The re-directed foreign aid will be government-light, society-heavy. Governments
on both the donor and recipient sides will have reduced controls. However, this
should not undermine collective efforts to make aid flows more transparent and
more accountable.

In the aid globalism, lesser money will be flown back to donor country-based
contractors and lesser money will be stuck in the bureaucratic gridlock of
recipients. Most of the aid will reach where it is needed the most.

Hearing aids for children

LENGTH: 675  words

DATELINE: Sri Lanka


Sri Lanka, Feb. 20 -- To get the best results out of a hearing aid, you and your
child should meet a certified audiologist to learn what a hearing aid can and
cannot do, and how to operate it.

It is important to understand how hearing aids work and how to select, operate
and care for them. Properly working hearing aids and consistent use of hearing
aids will help your child hear and develop good speech and language skills.

How does a hearing aid work?

All behind-the-ear hearing aids have a microphone, amplifiers and processors, a
volume control, a tone hook, an earmould, an on/off switch, and a battery
compartment.

The sound enters through the microphone, is amplified and shaped by the
processor, and is directed out the tone hook and through the earmould into your
child's ear.

The earmould is specifically made to the shape of your child's

ear. Earmoulds need to be replaced fairly often as your child's ear grows.

What kind of hearing aid is best for your child?

It is important to work with your audiologist and early intervention team to
evaluate your child's needs. Since very young children cannot adjust their own
hearing aids, the hearing aid selected for infants must be easily manipulated
and monitored by parents and caregivers.

As your child grows and develops and can respond to more sophisticated tests,
hearing aids are adjusted accordingly. Therefore, hearing aids that can be
easily adjusted for frequency response, amount of amplification, and maximum
limits of amplification are desirable. These devices are typically digital
hearing aids.

In educational and home settings, children frequently connect their hearing aids
to hearing assistive technology systems. Therefore, the hearing aid prescribed
should have special features (telecoil and direct audio input capability) that
will allow for this connection.

Several types of hearing aids are available; the appropriate type depends on
your child's individual needs and skills. The behind-the-ear (BTE) hearing aid
is the type of hearing and most commonly recommended for infants and young
children for a number of reasons, including:

It accommodates various earmould types

The earmould detaches and can be easily remade as the child grows

The earmould is easy to handle and can be easily cleaned.

Parents and caregivers can easily do a listening check and make adjustments.

It can accommodate a wide variety of hearing losses.

It can be made with direct audio input or a telecoil, so it can be used with
other listening devices.

The earmoulds are made of a soft maternal that is safer and more comfortable for
tiny ears.

In-the-ear (ITE) styles are usually reserved for adults and older children. Once
you have selected a hearing aid, the audiologist will carefully set the hearing
aid using the results of your child's hearing tests.

Keeping hearing aids on your child

It is very important that children with hearing loss use their hearing aids as
much as possible. A child who has been wearing hearing aids consistently since
infancy will probably wear them without resistance. Children who have not been
consistent hearing aid wearers may be more of a challenge.

Start by putting the hearing aids on your child while you are engaged in a fun
activity and increase the amount of time until your child is wearing the hearing
aids during all waking hours.

Young children should learn that only an adult should put the hearing aids on
and take the hearing aids off. Older children may be more interested in their
hearing aids if they are able to provide input into the color of their earmould
or hearing aid.

There are several ways to secure the hearing aids to your child's ears. Some
ideas include two-sided toupee tape, Huggie Aids, lightweight caps and
headbands, fishing line and a safety pin, and hearing aid clips. Your
audiologist will help you find the best method for your child. Published by HT

10.3 Bil. Yen Budget Planned To Curb AIDS

SECTION: Pg. 1

LENGTH: 554 words


The Health and Welfare Ministry will appropriate 10.28 billion yen next fiscal
year on large-scale initiatives aimed at stopping the spread of AIDS, about five
times than was appropriated this fiscal year.

Comprehensive measures against AIDS to be initiated next fiscal year will center
on free AIDS tests at public health centers nationwide, but will also include
AIDS research and education.

The AIDS-related appropriation for the current fiscal year is about 2.1 billion
yen.

Ministry officials said the increased appropriation would be extended for three
years in an effort to halt the spread of AIDS. The government also hopes to
obtain the cooperation of the private sector in its AIDS prevention measures.

The AIDS-related appropriation is the major feature of the ministry's budgetary
request that was made Friday. The request totals 13,518.4 billion yen, an
increase of 751.4 billion yen, or 5.9 percent, over the ministry's total
expenditures in the original fiscal 1992 budget.

According to the ministry, there were 779 confirmed AIDS patients and HIV
carriers in Japan, excluding those who were infected through blood products, as
of the end of June this year. But the actual number is believed to be 10 times
larger.

Tokyo had 287 AIDS patients and HIV carriers at the end of June, more than any
other prefecture. Ibaraki-ken followed with 89 AIDS patients and virus carriers.

Recently, there has been a sharp increase in people contracting the AIDS virus
through heterosexual contact, indicating a danger that the disease might spread
widely in two or three years.

About 1.17 billion yen will be used to upgrade AIDS testing. AIDS tests will be
administered free and anonymously at health centers across Japan. The cost of
the testing will be shared by the national government and prefectural
governments.

The ministry expects that 100,000 people will take the free AIDS tests in the
next fiscal year. About 10,000 people took the AIDS test last year.

AIDS tests are presently conducted anonymously at about 800 health centers in
all prefectural districts except Hokkaido.

The ministry will also spend 2.24 billion yen to educate the public about AIDS
and AIDS prevention measures. The ministry will establish an organization that
will promote AIDS prevention, and will start joint educational projects between
the public and private sectors.

Another 4.83 billion yen will be appropriated for AIDS research, including
cooperation in international research on the disease. The ministry will also
sponsor domestic academic meetings on AIDS to prepare for an international AIDS
conference scheduled for Japan in 1994.

About 480 million yen will be appropriated to the improvement of AIDS medical
services. About 30 hospitals throughout the countries will become centers for
AIDS treatment and training in treatment, while hospices exclusively for
patients with terminal AIDS will be located in national sanitoriums.

The ministry will also counsel foreigners and distribute AIDS information to
young people at the health centers.

The ministry plans to train about 300 public health nurses in AIDS counseling
next fiscal year. It will also train foreign residents in Japan so that they can
act as interpreters at health centers in cities that have large foreigner
populations.

A checkered history of tragedy, despair and hope

BYLINE: Kim Painter

SECTION: LIFE; Pg. 6D

LENGTH: 943 words


The AIDS epidemic began 10 years ago this week, with a veritable whisper - a
brief report on page two of a weekly bulletin of the federal Centers for Disease
Control. A short history of the deadly disease.
1981

June 5: The CDC publishes a report of a rare pneumonia in five gay men.

July 4: CDC reports more mysterious illnesses in gay men.

Dec. 31: By the end of the year, 152 cases have been reported.  The name
gay-related immune deficiency (GRID) has been coined.
1982

June 18: The CDC publishes a study strongly suggesting, though not proving, that
GRID is an infectious disease, spread among sexual partners.

July: The CDC reports cases in hemophiliacs and Haitian immigrants. Officials
discard the GRID name and come up with acquired immune deficiency syndrome -
AIDS.

December: CDC reports the first clear case of AIDS from transfusion.

Dec. 31: 1,300 U.S. AIDS cases have been reported and 317 are dead.
1983

Jan. 7: The CDC reports the first heterosexual AIDS cases.

March 3: Health officials ask people at high risk for AIDS to voluntarily defer
from donating blood.

April 11: Newsweek runs the first AIDS cover story.

May 24: Dr. Edward Brandt, assistant secretary for health, declares AIDS the
nation's ''No. 1 health priority.''

June: French researchers under Dr. Luc Montagnier announce they've found a
previously unknown virus in AIDS patients.

Dec. 31: 4,156 AIDS cases and 1,292 AIDS deaths have been reported to CDC.
1984

April 23: Health secretary Margaret Heckler announces the AIDS virus has been
clearly identified by Dr. Robert Gallo of the National Cancer Institute.  She
gives a nod to the French, who have strong evidence their virus is also the AIDS
virus, but indicates the bulk of credit goes to the U.S. -

Dec. 31: 9,920 AIDS cases and 3,665 AIDS deaths have been reported.
1985

Feb. 8: Montagnier reveals his virus and Gallo's are so genetically similar that
they might have come from the same patient. Thus begins an international
controversy that will continue into the 1990s, long after they've officially
agreed to share credit for the virus named HIV - the human immunodeficiency
virus.

March 2: The HIV antibody test is licensed.

April 15: The first international AIDS conference opens in Atlanta.
The CDC's Dr. James Curran estimates 500,000 to 1 million Americans are
infected.

July 15: An emaciated Rock Hudson makes a TV appearance with old friend Doris
Day. He tells reporters he has the flu. Soon after, news reports say he is ill
with AIDS.

Sept. 12: A poll shows 1 of 4 Americans think children with AIDS shouldn't be in
schools, reflecting fears of protesters trying to remove such children from
schools around the country. Among them: Ryan White, a 13-year-old Indiana boy.

Dec. 31: 20,470 cases, 8,161 deaths have been reported.
1986

February: Researchers report that the AIDS virus can lie dormant in the body for
years. -

June: Experts at the second international AIDS conference say the disease
afflicts 100,000 worldwide.

Oct. 22: Ronald Reagan's surgeon general, Dr. C. Everett Koop, calls for
explicit AIDS education and widespread condom use.

Dec. 31: 37,061 cases have been reported; 16,301 are dead.
1987

March: Frustrated New York activists form the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power,
or ACT-UP.  The group will spread nationwide, leaving trademark Silence = Death
stickers in the wake of each act of civil disobedience and street theater.

March: AZT, the first drug to fight the AIDS virus, is approved for people with
AIDS.-

May 31: Reagan makes his first public remarks on AIDS, at the third
international AIDS conference in Washington.

Oct. 11: San Francisco AIDS activist Cleve Jones and friends display the first
1,000 panels of their Names Project quilt during a Washington, D.C., march. The
quilt panels, each representing someone dead from AIDS, cover two blocks.
Eventually, the quilt will grow to 14 tons and stretch for 4 miles.

Dec. 31: 59,587 U.S. cases have been reported; 27,909 are dead.
1988

June: Pessimism is the theme of the fourth international AIDS conference, in
Stockholm, Sweden. Scientists express doubt about ever finding an AIDS vaccine.

Dec. 31: 88,864 U.S. cases have been reported and 46,134 are dead.
1989

February: The FDA gives preliminary approval to a drug called aerosol
pentamidine, which can often prevent the pneumonia that kills 60% of AIDS
sufferers.

June: Optimistic scientists at the fifth international AIDS conference in
Montreal admit they are a few years away from making HIV infection a manageable,
chronic illness, rather than a fatal one.

August: AZT is proven to slow, but not stop, the progression of HIV disease in
people with some immune system damage but few or no symptoms. This leads AIDS
advocacy groups to strongly endorse widespread, voluntary testing.

Dec. 31: 115,756 U.S. cases have been reported; 70,313 are dead.
1990

April 8: Ryan White, the best-known face of the epidemic, dies at age 18.
June: The sixth international AIDS conference ends in an uneasy truce between
activists and scientists, who vow to work together to get promising treatments
to infected people.

Dec. 31: 161,073 U.S. AIDS cases have been reported; 100,813 are dead.
1991

June 5: On the 10th anniversary of the first AIDS report, more than 174,893 U.S.
AIDS cases have been reported; of those more than 110,530 are dead.  U.S.
officials estimate 1 million people are infected with HIV and 40,000 to 80,000
more will be infected before the end of the year.  The World Health Organization
estimates 10 million are infected worldwide and projects 40 million infections
by the year 2000.

Skilled help fitting best hearing aid

SECTION: ADVERTISING; SUPPLEMENT; Pg. 9; CHCH HEARING AID AND AUDIOLOGY CLINIC

LENGTH: 584 words


The best person to help you to overcome hearing loss is an audiologist, and the
three clinicians at the Christchurch Hearing Aid and Audiology Clinic, Brian
Conaghan, Jeanine Doherty, and Sandra Knight, have a combined experience of 43
years between them.

Despite their skill and their knowledge of the latest hearing-aid technology,
they say that older-style, less-expensive hearing aids are often adequate.

We often see advertisements for the very latest and usually the most expensive
hearing aids,'' says Mr Conaghan.

It is the role of an audiologist to view each person's hearing loss as unique,
and to give advice on a variety of hearing-aid choices based on the degree and
type of hearing loss, as well as the different social interactions and hearing
problems that the person faces in their daily life.

The most expensive or latest-technology hearing aid is not necessarily the best
or appropriate choice,'' he says.

A person who needs a hearing aid mainly for enjoying television and for
communicating with relatives at home does not require the most sophisticated
hearing aid.''

Mr Conaghan believes that many advertisements for high-tech hearing aids are
misleading, and give people unrealistic expectations about an aid's capability.

It is incumbent on the audiologist to give the client realistic expectations
well before the trial of any hearing aid,'' he says.

As audiologists, the clinicians at the Christchurch Hearing Aid and Audiology
Clinic are trained to focus on the client's particular requirements.

We focus as much expert attention on the evaluation, hearing-aid fitting, and
rehabilitation as on the actual technology of the hearing aid,'' says Mr
Conaghan.  It is the person who is the focus, not the technology of the aid.''

People need to know what it will be like to wear a hearing aid, he says. With a
hearing aid fitted, people hear some sounds they have not heard before, or which
they have not heard for a long time.

Their own voice will sound louder, and they will need to learn to tune out
background noises,'' says Mr Conaghan.

Sometimes speech sounds will sound different to how you think they should. It
can take several weeks to adjust to a hearing aid.''

A hearing aid should help a person to hear, but not necessarily in all
situations, he says.

Despite technological advances and good follow-up care, when background noise is
very loud, hearing can still be difficult.

Most hearing-aid users would agree that while they wouldn't want to be without
their hearing aids, a hearing aid is no substitute for an ear,'' says Mr
Conaghan.

The clinic offers a wide selection of hearing aids, including discreet hearing
aids, hearing aids that fit inside the ear, aids that sit behind the ear, and
remote-control and automatic hearing aids which incorporate the most
sophisticated hearing-aid technology.

All clients have a free trial period of about three weeks, in which they can
evaluate the hearing aid's performance for themselves.

If the hearing aid is deemed by the client to be unsuitable, it can be returned
at no cost.

We strongly recommend that people shop around and compare prices,'' says Mr
Conaghan.

Prices can vary considerably between professional clinics.

Often it is those who do not employ full-time professional audiology staff who
charge the most.''

ARTICLE: STATE AIDS AND EUROPEAN COMMUNITY LAW

NAME: Dr. Hans-Jorg Niemeyer *

BIO:



   * Partner, Gleiss, Lutz, Hootz, Hirsch and Partners, Brussels/Stuttgart. This
is the extended and updated version of a speech given at the seminar "Overseas
Investment" organized by the International Law Section of the State Bar of
Michigan in Dearborn, Michigan on October 13, 1992.

 LEXISNEXIS SUMMARY:
 ... A beneficiary is not justified in relying on the compliance of an aid with
EC law when the Commission is reviewing the aid prior to reaching a final
decision under article 93. ...  Consequently, the recipient is not justified in
simply trusting that the Member State has complied with its obligation under
article 93. ...  The Commission still must examine the aid under article 92. ...
The French Conseil d'Etat requested the Court of Justice to give a preliminary
ruling under article 177 on the decisive question: is an aid measure which was
implemented in violation of the stand-still clause, remedied a posteriori if the
Commission declares, in its final decision, the aid measure compatible with the
Common Market?  ...

TEXT:
 [*190]  INTRODUCTION

   The existence of State aids can considerably influence the decision of an
investor regarding the region or sector in which to invest.  State aids can
reduce substantially investors' starting and capital costs, thereby enhancing
the desirability of investing in a particular location.  Therefore, a legal
adviser should be aware of the available State aid programs if a client is
seeking a location for production facilities.  In the European Community (EC), a
system has been set in place which substantially restricts the right of EC
Member States to grant aids or subsidies to investors.  The consequences of
disregarding the EC provisions can be severe.  If the EC Commission finds that
the aid was illegally granted, it can order the investor to repay the entire
amount of the aid.

   A case which demonstrates the consequences of disregarding the EC laws arose
out of the Toyota Motor Corporation investment in Great Britain.  In 1989,
Toyota decided to build a new plant to produce passenger cars in England.
Toyota's decision to invest in England was influenced by the fact that the local
county, which owned the building site, offered Toyota the real estate for an
inexpensive price.  The EC Commission became aware of this investment and
concluded that the difference between the market value of the building site and
the price paid by Toyota constituted illegal State aid.  n1 The consequence was
that Toyota had to pay this difference to the county.

   In light of the risks involved, investors and legal advisers must fully
understand the EC State aid laws before embarking in any investment in the EC.
This article provides an overview of EC State aid rules, focusing on recent
Commission policy and recent judgments of the Court of Justice on State aids.
n2 In Part I, some general points, such as what may  [*191]  constitute a State
aid, are considered.  In Part II, the procedural aspects are dealt with in more
detail, with emphasis on the notification process, and the procedure for
reviewing State aids.  Part III examines the recovery of illegally granted aids,
and the defenses a beneficiary may assert.  Next, Part IV sets out the remedies
available for breach of the State aid rules, including the right to contest the
Commission's decisions.  The article concludes by pointing out the shortcomings
of the present procedures and suggesting changes that could improve the
procedures, especially from the perspective of outside investors unfamiliar with
the EC rules.

   I.  STATE AIDS IN THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY

   A.  Background

   The control of State aids is part of the general competition policy in the
Community and is codified in the EEC Treaty.  In order to foster competition,
the Treaty prohibits restrictions on competition by private individuals.
Further, it prohibits Member States from granting aid to national industries
that distorts, or threatens to distort, competition and trade between Member
States.

   Addressing the problem of State aids has become an increasingly important
part of the Commission's competition policy in recent years.  This new focus
results from the dramatic increase in aid proposals submitted to the EC
Commission -- from 296 in 1989, to 429 in 1990.  n3 By the end of the 1980s, the
total amount of subsidies granted by the twelve Member States reached ninety
billion ECU per year  n4 (1 ECU = 1.13 US].

   The Commission's actions in regulation of State aid have always been
controversial.  Especially in times of recession, there is pressure on national
governments to provide help to economically disadvantaged regions and industries
in order to curb unemployment.  Therefore, opponents of a vigorous State aid
policy advocate the idea that the application of the State aid rules should be
relaxed in times of recession in order to help those countries which are most in
need.

    [*192]  On the other side, supporters of an unyielding State aid policy
point out that the Europeans are still completing the internal market in the EC.
One prerequisite for its completion is the elimination of policies which distort
competition between Member States.  If Member States are allowed to use State
aid to defend their national companies or industries from the pressure of
increased competition, these new barriers could jeopardize the efficient
allocation of resources within the single market.  n5 One State's aid can lead
to another state's unemployment.  Thus, the supporters of the EC State aid
policy argue that during a recession, a rigorous State aid policy takes on even
greater importance.

   While the debate rages on, no relaxation of the policy has actually occurred.
Thus, anyone contemplating an investment in the EC would be unwise to proceed
without first consulting the applicable laws.

   B.  The Concept of Aid within Article 92(1) of the EEC Treaty

   1.  The Broad Concept of Aid

   The first thing an investor must determine when considering a Member State's
offer of aid is whether that offer constitutes "State aid" as defined by the EEC
Treaty.  Article 92(1) of the EEC Treaty defines State aid as "any aid granted
by a Member State or through State resources in any form whatsoever."  n6 This
broad definition encompasses a wide variety of possible aids.  It is generally
agreed that it includes all forms of positive benefit to a recipient, including
actual cash subsidies, as well as any measure that relieves an undertaking of
costs it would otherwise have to bear.  n7

   Where a company receives a benefit from the State, and the State receives no
consideration in return, it is clear that a State aid has been granted.  In
addition, given that the concept of State aid has been interpreted broadly, a
State aid exists when the value of the services or goods provided by the
investor is less than the consideration given for them by the State, or,
conversely, when the State demands less payment than the value of the goods or
services that the State provides to a  [*193]  company.  n8

   When considering sales agreements, particularly with regard to the sale of
building sites by the State to an investor, State aid has been granted if the
terms and conditions of the sale depart from normal commercial practice.  n9
Examples of State aids are non-repayable subsidies; loans from State-owned
financial institutions at reduced rates; reductions in income or corporation
tax; capital injection by a public authority; payment of below-market prices for
energy; or the sale of real estate at a price below the market value.

   Despite the broad concept of aid, not all State measures that benefit a
company or groups of companies can be considered State aid within the meaning of
article 92(1).  Rather, the purpose of the State measure must aim at conferring
a financial advantage on the undertakings concerned, which would result in the
State assuming an additional burden.  n10 Therefore, a State measure whose
purpose is not to confer a cost advantage to certain undertakings, but merely
has consequential financial effects, is not considered State aid.  n11

   2.  The Market Economy Investor Principle

   In recent years, it has become common for Member States to assist companies,
especially those involved in public undertakings, through capital injections.
In these cases, the Commission applies the so-called "market economy investor
principle."  n12 In order to determine whether any aid is involved, the
Commission examines whether a private investor, considering the expected return
-- but ignoring all social, regional, policy, and sectoral considerations --
would have been willing to  [*194]  make those contributions in a similar
situation.  If a private investor would not have been able to expect an
acceptable rate of profitability on the capital invested, the capital injection
is considered an aid.  The Court of Justice accepted this principle as an
appropriate method for determining whether a capital injection is considered an
aid.  n13

   In Italy v. Commission,  n14 the Court refined the "market economy investor
principle" by making a distinction between private investors investing capital
in the short term, and private holding groups which have a longer-term
perspective.  In 1986, the Italian State-holding company Finmeccanica, which
owned Alfa Romeo, carried out two capital infusions into Alfa Romeo amounting to
ECU 429 million.  The Commission decided that a private investor never would
have made a similar investment, because Alfa Romeo had continuous losses between
1974 and 1986, and because the capital was not provided on the condition that
Alfa Romeo rationalize its production.  The Court held that where a private
holding group, even considering decisions at the level of the whole group in a
wider economic context, is not able to expect an acceptable rate of
profitability (even in the long term) on the capital invested, the capital
injection is an aid.  n15

   3.  Sources of Aid

   To be considered State aid, the aid must be granted by a Member State or
through State resources.  The term "through State resources" includes not only
public bodies, but also private companies that are under the control of the
State and established or appointed to administer the aid.  n16

   Nevertheless, aid granted by a Member State, but financed from EC funds,
falls outside the scope of article 92 since the aid must come from the financial
resources of a Member State.  n17 It should be noted that in  [*195]  recent
years, the Commission has become one of the largest financial backers in Europe.
Almost 64 billion ECU are available in the budget of the EC for Community
subsidies.

   4.  State Aid Favoring Certain Undertakings

   Only those State aids that are granted to certain undertakings or to all
undertakings within a particular industry fall within article 92.  Thus, public
funds paid out to all undertakings in a Member State are not considered to be
State aids.  While this distinction is simple enough, the favoring of certain
undertakings or sectors is not always obvious.  For example, an Italian measure
reduced the health insurance costs of all female workers.  Upon closer
examination, the Commission determined that this measure constituted State aid
since it disproportionately benefited textile companies, which employed an above
average number of women.  n18

   5.  The Effect on Competition and on Trade Between Member States

   Finally, for a State aid to fall within article 92, it must distort or
threaten to distort competition by favoring certain undertakings and must affect
trade between Member States.  In order to determine whether competition and
trade between Member States is affected, the Commission has to examine the
relevant market, the position of the recipient of the aid, the volume of
inter-State trade, and the exports of the company concerned.  n19 The standard
of evidence for distortion is quite low.  The Court of Justice has adopted a
broad approach in determining whether State aid distorts or threatens to distort
competition.  n20 The Court argues that where competition between companies in
various Member States exists, any financial aid is capable of distorting
competition.  The aid artificially strengthens the position of the recipient
company, and this hinders the ability of other producers to increase their
market shares and exports.  This principle applies even if the recipient of the
State aid is not engaged in exports.  It is sufficient that the aid enables
undertakings to maintain or increase their production, thereby reducing the
opportunities of competitors from other Member States to export their goods
[*196]  into the recipient's country.  n21 Even a relatively small amount of
State aid may affect trade between the Member States if there is vigorous
competition in that sector, or if the profit margins are small, such as in the
textile industry.  n22

   Additionally, unlike other competition cases, no de minimis threshold applies
in State aid cases.  Consequently, the relatively small size of the recipient of
a State aid does not exclude a priori the effect on inter-State trade.  n23 As a
consequence, the Commission does not have to provide evidence that trade between
Member States is actually affected.  It is sufficient that the aid may affect
inter-State trade.

   Nevertheless, it is also clear that not all aids have a perceptible impact on
trade and competition between Member States.  This is true especially of aid
provided in very small amounts, mainly though not exclusively, to small and
medium-sized companies, and often under schemes run by local or regional
authorities.  Based on past experience, the Commission has set a de minimis
figure at payments of ECU 50,000 to one undertaking for a particular type of
expenditure -- such as investment or training -- over a three-year period.  This
rule applies to all companies, notwithstanding their size.  State aids below
this de minimis figure do not fall under article 92(1).  n24

   C.  Treaty-Based Exceptions to the Prohibition on State Aids

   Article 92(2) provides that certain social aids, subsidies to remove damages
caused by natural disasters, and aids to compensate for economic disadvantages
caused by the division of Germany, are per se allowable.  There is no need to
notify the Commission before implementing such aids.

   Much more important in practice are the exemptions under article 92(3).
Under article 92(3) the Commission has the discretion to exempt aids falling
into the three main categories: (1) aid for very depressed regions; (2) aid to
promote the execution of an important project of common interest or to remedy a
serious disturbance in a Member State's economy; and (3) regional and sectoral
aid.

    [*197]  The Commission has broad discretion to authorize a State aid under
these three categories.  The Court of Justice has been quite reserved in
examining the Commission's discretion as long as the Commission's decision was
reasonably substantiated.  n25

   1.  Aids for Very Depressed Regions

   The Commission has set out principles for approving national regional aid
under article 92(3)(a).  n26 It is sufficient to say that regional aids are only
justified for areas which have severe regional problems in relation to the
Community as a whole (and not just in relation to the Member State).  n27 The
socioeconomic situation of article 92(3)(a) regions is assessed primarily by
reference to the purchasing power standards (PPS) based on the Gross National
Product.  n28 The article 92(3)(a) regions are Greece, Ireland, and Portugal
(all of the States), parts of Italy and Spain, and Northern Ireland.  n29 The
Commission allows aid of up to seventy-five percent of the total investment,
depending on the intensity or urgency of the regional problems.  With respect to
the type of aid, it allows regional aid linked to initial investment or job
creation, as well as, under certain circumstances, operating aid designed to
overcome particular or permanent disadvantage.  n30 As an example, the
Commission did not object to State aids granted by the Portuguese government to
the automotive components manufacturer Delco Remy,  n31 or to a Portuguese aid
granted to the Ford/Volkswagen joint venture  n32 to build a minivan.  In both
cases, the subsidies amounted to more than thirty percent of the investment
costs.

    [*198]  Due to the restrictive application by the Commission, the
significance of article 92(3)(a) is low, and most of the national regional aids
are examined as regional or sectoral aids under article 92(3)(c), which is
discussed below in Part I.C.3.  n33

   2.  Aids to Promote an Important European Project

   Projects that fall into this category are European transnational programs
supported jointly by various governments, or concerted action taken by the
various Member States to combat a common problem such as the pollution of the
environment.  n34 Furthermore, any aid granted to companies for their
participation in research and development projects of common European interest
may also qualify under article 92(3)(b).  n35

   3.  Sectoral and Regional Aids

   Under article 92(3)(c), the Commission may authorize two different types of
State aids: sectoral aids promoting certain industrial sectors, and regional
aids promoting a certain area within the EC.  n36 Thus, regional aids may be
authorized under subsection (a) as well as (c).  Under subsection (c), aid
measures can be justified for regions that are disadvantaged in relation to
other parts of the same Member State as a result of factors such as lower income
or higher unemployment than the Member State average.

   The Commission has set up several notices and Community frameworks on
sectoral aid schemes for industries such as textile, shipbuilding, or motor
vehicles.  n37 Such frameworks have also been set up for regional aid schemes.
n38 These notices provide guidelines for the assessment of such aids.

   There are a number of basic criteria for determining the propriety of the
aid.  The aid scheme must be clear enough so that the Commission can be able to
determine the type of aid.  Also, the purpose of the aid  [*199]  must comply
with the objectives of the Community.  In the case of industry sectors in
crisis, subsidies are inappropriate where their sole effect would be to maintain
the status quo.  They have to be linked to restructuring plans by which the
company is enabled to become viable.  n39 Where overcapacity exists, aid for
investment must not result in capacity increases.  n40 The aids must be
degressive, well-adapted to the restructuring of the specific sector, and the
intensity of the aid must be proportional to the aid's objective.  n41

   The Commission has generally shown a positive attitude towards regional aids,
especially if the aid is granted for the implementation of new production plants
in disadvantaged parts of the Community.  n42 Here the ceiling for aids is
between twenty to thirty percent of the investment costs.  n43 In contrast, the
Commission does not authorize operating aids, such as monetary infusions which
are not linked to restructuring plans, even in disadvantaged regions.

   4.  Implications

   Considering all the different guidelines and frameworks, there are many
possibilities for the Commission to authorize State aids under article 92(3).
Thus, it appears that the Commission's State aid control is actually quite
lenient.  This view is confirmed by the fact that from 429 notifications in
1990, the Commission decided that only twelve State aids were illegal.  n44

   II.  PROCEDURAL ASPECTS

   Article 93 gives the Commission a general right of supervision over State
aids.  It provides for a procedure that permits the Commission to force Member
States to abolish or to suspend State aids which are incompatible with article
92.  Article 93 distinguishes between existing aids and new aids, which have
different procedural treatments.

    [*200]  A.  Review of Existing Aid Systems (art. 93(1))

   An existing aid is one which was either in operation at the time the EEC
Treaty came into force, or which was in operation at the time a new Member State
joined the EC (like Spain and Portugal in 1986).  Aids that were properly
implemented after that time with the consent of the Commission are also treated
as existing aids.  Such existing aids are legal and can remain in force until
the Commission requires their abolition or alteration.

   Article 93(1) provides that the Commission must constantly review the
propriety of existing aids.  For example, a regional aid may have been
authorized by the Commission, but due to the improvement of the economic
situation in that region, the aid is no longer justified.  n45 In such a case,
the Commission shall rule that the State concerned must alter or abolish the
State aid after having carried out the contentious procedure set out in article
93(2).  n46 Such a decision does not have a retroactive effect.  Recovery of the
aid may only be ordered with respect to those aids granted by a Member State
after the Commission decided on the abolition of the aid.

   B.  Notification of New Aids (art. 93(3))

   The most important procedural rule is the notification procedure for new aids
set forth in article 93(3).  Member States are obliged to notify the Commission
of any plans to grant new aids or to alter existing aids.  There is, however, no
such obligation to notify other parties, such as the recipient of the aid.  n47
The Commission has set a new threshold of ECU 50,000 below which an individual
aid is no longer subject to prior notification to the Commission.  This amount
does not, however, apply for certain sensitive sectors subject to special rules
such as the ship-building or the motor vehicle industry.  n48

   The last sentence of article 93(3) provides that the Member States are
prevented from putting an aid scheme into effect, and especially from paying out
the subsidy, until the Commission has declared the State aid compatible with the
Common Market.  This prohibition, known  [*201]  as the stand-still clause,  n49
is directly actionable.  It provides rights attaching to individuals which must
be protected by national courts.  If the aid was implemented without observance
of the prior review procedure under article 93(2) and (3), i.e., without
notification or between a notification and the Commission's decision, national
courts have the power to safeguard the rights of individuals against this
disregard by the Member State's authorities.  n50

   C.  Procedure When the Commission is Notified

   Once the notification of State aid by the Member State was properly made, the
Commission must follow procedure in ruling on the propriety of the aid.  The
Commission must form its initial opinion on the notification within a two-month
preliminary period of investigation.  By the end of this two month period, the
Commission must render its preliminary assessment of whether the aid falls
within the scope of article 92(1) and whether it may be exempted under article
92(3).  If the Commission has failed to rule on the notification during this
preliminary period, the Member State may implement the plan, but must give prior
notice of this implementation to the Commission.  n51

   The Commission's failure to make a preliminary assessment does not, however,
prevent the Commission from continuing its procedure.  The aid granted in the
interim period merely becomes an existing aid and is subject to review under
article 93(1) and (2).  As in the case of an existing aid, a decision to abolish
a new aid can have prospective effect only, and therefore the Commission may not
require aid granted in the interim period to be repaid.

   On the basis of the preliminary examination, the Commission can make two
"decisions." If the Commission raises no objections, it can authorize the aid.
The Commission informs the Member State of the authorization in an informal
letter.  In addition, the authorization can be published in the Official Journal
of the European Communities.  If, however, the Commission has serious doubts at
the end of the two month period, it must open the so-called contentious
procedure under article 93(2).

    [*202]  D.  Procedure When the Commission is Not Notified

   If a Member State implements a new aid without notifying the Commission, but
the aid nevertheless comes to the Commission's notice, the Commission evaluates
the aid in the following manner.  n52

   The Commission first asks the Member State for all information necessary for
the Commission to determine whether the aid is compatible with the Common
Market.  If the Member State does not reply, or if the reply is incomplete, the
Commission may take a provisional step by requiring the Member State to suspend
the operation of the aid scheme and to inform the Commission of the manner of
its compliance with the decision within 15 days.  n53

   If the Member State complies with this provisional decision, the Commission
is obliged to examine the aid pursuant to article 93(2) and (3).  If the Member
State fails to comply with the provisional decision, the Commission can proceed
to a final decision on the legality of the aid.  The Commission may prohibit the
aid in a final decision under article 93(2) on the basis of the information in
its possession since the Member State opted not to offer any additional
information.  In this (final) decision, the Commission can, if necessary, seek
repayment of the amount of the aid already granted.  If the Member State fails
to comply with either a provisional decision or a negative final decision, the
Commission may refer the matter directly to the Court of Justice pursuant to
article 93(2), subparagraph 2, and apply for interim measures if necessary.

   It should be noted that the failure to notify the Commission of a new aid
does not render the aid automatically unlawful.  Thus, the Commission cannot
declare aid illegal solely because the Member State has failed to meet its
obligation to notify.  As stated above, the Commission is obliged to examine the
aid pursuant to article 93(3) and has to open the contentious procedure under
article 93(2) if it intends to prohibit the aid.  If the parties do not submit
additional information or comments, however, the Commission may make a final
decision on the basis of the information in its possession.  n54

    [*203]  E.  The Contentious Procedure

   The Commission must open the contentious procedure if it has serious
difficulties in assessing whether or not the State aid is compatible with the
Common Market.  In particular, this occurs when only a complex analysis of the
market, and further investigations of the undertakings in the affected market,
can resolve such serious difficulties.  n55 The significance of an investment or
an aid per se, however, cannot constitute such serious difficulties.  Otherwise,
the Commission would have to open the contentious procedure in all cases where
the investment or the aid exceeds certain thresholds.  n56

   The contentious procedure starts with the Commission announcing the
initiation of the procedure in the Official Journal.  It invites the interested
parties -- the Member States, the recipient, and the competitors in all Member
States -- to submit their comments.  The recipient of the aid does not have to
be informed individually.  n57 The Commission then examines the views of all the
interested parties.  The Member State concerned is also given the opportunity to
comment on any submissions made by third parties if the Commission intends to
base its decision on such submissions.  n58

   If the Commission finds that the aid is not compatible with article 92, the
Member State must abolish the aid.  In addition, the Commission may require the
repayment of the aid if it was unlawfully paid to the recipient.  If the
Commission raises no objections, it then authorizes the aid, sometimes subject
to certain alterations.  All decisions, whether for or against the aid, must be
published in the Official Journal.

   There is no time limit within which the Commission must reach a decision
under article 93(2).  However, in a case where the procedure lasted twenty-six
months, and the Commission offered no justification for the delay, the Court of
Justice considered the procedure unreasonably long and annulled the Commission's
subsequent decision.  n59

   Finally, it should be noted that the Court requires the Commission to observe
the article 93 procedure strictly.  For example, in British Aerospace and Rover
v. Commission, the Court annulled the Commission  [*204]  decision on purely
procedural grounds.  n60 In that case, the British government had granted
certain benefits to British Aerospace in connection with its acquisition of the
Rover group.  The EC Commission authorized that State aid, subject to certain
conditions.  Later, information was revealed indicating that the Government had
granted further financial concessions of approximately forty-four million
British pounds.  The Commission, concluding that these concessions were illegal
aid, issued a decision requiring Great Britain to recover the extra concessions
from the recipient.

   The Court reviewed the Commission's decision and held that the Commission did
not comply with the procedural rules provided in article 93.  The Court
determined that when the Commission found the further aid illegal, it should
have done two things.  Since the extra aid constituted a breach of the
conditions and terms of the earlier decisions, the Commission should have
referred the matter directly to the Court of Justice pursuant to article 93(2),
subparagraph 2.  Also, since there was a new aid which had not been examined
previously through the proper procedure, the Commission should have opened a
contentious procedure (art. 93 (2)), which includes a hearing of the interested
parties.  Since the Commission's decision merely required the recipient to repay
the money, without giving the parties concerned an opportunity to be heard, the
Court annulled the decision.

   III.  REPAYMENT OF ILLEGALLY GRANTED STATE AIDS

   A.  The Commission's Power to Order Repayment

   A Commission decision to abolish illegal State aid would be without practical
effect if the Commission could not require the Member State concerned to recover
this illegal aid from the recipient.  It is thus well established in Community
law that the Commission has the power to require such recovery, including the
interest accrued on the granted aid.  n61 The aid is not always repaid to the
Member State, but rather to the institution granting the aid, and never to the
Commission.

   The Commission has discretion over whether or to what extent the aid must be
reimbursed.  This enables the Commission to take into  [*205]  consideration the
particularity of each case.  In exercising its discretion, the Commission has to
respect the principle of proportionality and the principle of respect of
legitimate expectation.  n62

   B.  Compliance with the Order of Repayment

   If the Commission orders the recovery of aid payments, article 173 (subparts
2 and 3) allows the Member State, as the addressee of such order, to appeal the
decision within a two-month period.  When this time limit expires, the
Commission's decision becomes final.  The Member State must then carry out all
appropriate measures to recover the aid payments from the recipient of the aid.
n63

   There is an established principle that a Member State may not claim that
provisions, practices, or circumstances existing in its legal system justify its
failure to comply with obligations resulting from Community law.  n64 The Member
State must use all the power at its disposal to secure repayment including, if
necessary, exercising its rights as shareholder or creditor to wind up the
company.  n65 The Member State may only plead that compliance with the order is
absolutely impossible.  n66 Therefore, financial difficulties of the aided
undertaking do not make compliance with the Commission's decision an "absolute
impossibility."  n67 Since the purpose of ordering repayment is to remove the
effects of an unlawful aid, where the recipient survived solely because of the
aid, a necessary consequence of the order of repayment is to force the recipient
into liquidation.  Furthermore, a Commission decision ordering the suppression
of the aid by means of repayment of the amount paid is not out of proportion
with the illegal act but simply the logical consequence of the illegality of the
aid.  n68

    [*206]  Any difficulties in the implementation of the Commission's decision
have no influence on its legality.  If, however, the aided undertaking were to
go into liquidation whereby its property and assets were surrendered to its
creditors and the Member State exercised all rights as creditor in the winding
up procedure for the amount of aid paid, then the Member State would have
adequately complied with its obligations under the Commission's order.  n69

   If a Member State finds that there are difficulties in carrying out a
Commission decision ordering recovery, then, rather than ignoring the decision,
the Member State should submit proposals to the Commission, pursuant to article
5 of the EEC Treaty, for suitable amendments to the decision.  n70 However, it
is not sufficient to merely inform the Commission of legal and practical
difficulties with respect to the recovery, before actually trying to secure
payment from the recipient and before submitting proposals for suitable
amendments.  n71

   C.  Application of National Law

   European Community law does not provide rules for the actual recovery of
unlawful State aids.  In the absence of such provisions, the national
authorities must proceed in accordance with the procedural and substantive rules
of their own national law regarding the recovery of monies which were improperly
paid.  n72 The application of national law is, however, subject to the limit
imposed by Community law.  Accordingly, national law must be applied in a manner
that does not make the recovery virtually impossible.  n73 As an example, in
Commission v. Germany,  n74 the German government argued that under German law,
the State may require recovery of the aid only within a limited time period and
that this period had already expired.  The Court denied this argument and held
that since Community law prevails over national law, the application of national
law must not make the Community obligation of repayment impossible in practice.

   Moreover, the application of national law must not affect the scope  [*207]
and effectiveness of Community law.  n75 The Community interest in recovery of
unduly paid aid must be fully taken into consideration.  n76 Thus, the exercise
of any discretion in determining whether or not it would be expedient to demand
recovery of the aid is not permitted if Community law requires such recovery.
n77 The fact that national law does not provide rules and procedures for
recovering unduly paid aid does not affect the Member States' obligation to
recover such aid.  n78

   D.  Legitimate Expectation of the Beneficiary

   If the recipient relied on the legality of the aid, requiring repayment of
the aid may conflict with the principle of protecting the legitimate
expectations of the beneficiary of an aid.  This principle is part of the legal
order of the Community.  n79 Therefore, a recipient may attempt to argue that,
based upon his good faith reliance on the Member State's compliance with the law
of State aids, his acceptance of the aid is protected and, thus, he is not
obliged to refund the aid granted him illegally.  n80 In certain circumstances,
this argument may be persuasive.

   A beneficiary is not justified in relying on the compliance of an aid with EC
law when the Commission is reviewing the aid prior to reaching a final decision
under article 93.  Consequently, if an aid is granted during the pending
Commission review, the recipient bears the risk that the aid be considered
illegal by the Commission and must be repaid.  An exception could be where the
Commission unreasonably delayed the proceeding without justification for the
delay.  Here, the recipient may have been legitimately justified in expecting
that the Commission would not object to the aid.  n81

   A recipient might try simply to argue that he relied on the Member State to
observe the Community procedures.  The notification of new aids under article
93(3) is, however, a fundamental obligation imposed on the Member States.  Thus,
a recipient who obtained an aid from a Member State must realize that this aid
has to be notified to the Commission,  [*208]  and that in the case of failure
of the Member State to do so, recovery of the aid may be required.  n82
Consequently, the recipient is not justified in simply trusting that the Member
State has complied with its obligation under article 93.  Rather, the recipient
should verify personally whether the Commission has been notified.  The Court of
Justice termed this the concept of the "diligent recipient," whose task is to
make sure that the procedure has been complied with.  n83 Thus, if a beneficiary
failed to verify whether there had been a notification, it would be impossible,
in principle, for him to rely on legitimate expectation.

   In sum, recipients of State aid can only invoke the protection of the
principle of legitimate expectation if the aid had been granted in accordance
with the notification procedure laid down in article 93, and if the aid was not
granted prior to a final Commission decision.  Nevertheless, there may be
exceptional cases where a recipient may establish legitimate expectation
although the aid was granted without observing these procedural requirements.
n84 This might occur where an undertaking was granted an "atypical State aid,"
which the Commission considered State aid because of the concept's broad
definition,  n85 and the undertaking is not familiar with the EC law.  n86

   IV.  REMEDIES

   A.  Remedies Before the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance of
the European Communities

   1.  The Commission's Enforcement Remedies

   If the Member State does not comply with a decision prohibiting an aid, the
Commission may enforce its decision by referring the matter directly to the
Court of Justice, pursuant to article 93(2), subparagraph 2.  In contrast to
articles 169 and 170, no formal notice and no issuance of a reasoned opinion to
the Member State is necessary.  n87 Together with its complaint under article
93(2), subparagraph 2, the Commission can apply for interim measures by the
Court of Justice, pursuant to article 186, should the Member State fail to
comply with the Commission's  [*209]  decision requiring it to abolish an aid.
n88

   The Commission has the same right of referral if a Member State fails to
comply with a so-called "provisional" decision.  Such a provisional decision
requires the Member State to suspend the operation of an aid which has not been
notified or which has been implemented before the Commission has ruled on the
aid.  n89

   2.  Other Parties' Remedies

   Pursuant to article 173(1), a Member State may appeal a Commission decision
requiring the Member State to abolish and to recover the aid granted.

   In two recent cases,  n90 the Court of Justice held that a Member State may
challenge a Commission decision to initiate the contentious procedure under
article 93(2).  The Court reasoned that such a Commission decision was not an
interim measure since it had binding legal effects on the Member State.  First,
the decision prohibited the Member State from implementing the aid measure
before the article 93(2) procedure was complete.  Furthermore, the decision was
more than a preparatory measure, the illegality of which could have been
challenged in the final decision.  Even if the Commission were to authorize the
aid in its final decision this would not have the consequence of remedying a
posteriori the implementation of that aid.  n91

   In contrast, the Commission's decision to initiate a procedure in competition
and anti-dumping proceedings, is only an intermediate measure whose purpose is
to prepare for a final decision, and is therefore not reviewable by the Court of
Justice.  n92

   In principle, a Member State can obtain interim relief against a Commission
decision pursuant to article 186 provided that the Member State can prove that
it will suffer serious and irreparable damage.  Nevertheless, the Member State
cannot obtain interim relief by arguing that its national industry or the
recipient would suffer such grave and  [*210]  irreparable harm.  In that case,
the recipient itself would have to apply for interim measures.  n93

   Whether the recipient of an aid is entitled directly to challenge a
Commission decision prohibiting an aid is not entirely clear.  Pursuant to
article 173(2), any undertaking is entitled to institute proceedings against a
decision addressed to another person, if this decision is of direct and
individual concern to that undertaking.  The Court of Justice has held that
where the intended recipient was a single undertaking, or where the intended
recipients of the proposed aid constituted a closed category of undertakings,
the decision could be challenged by those undertakings.  In contrast, if there
is a large number of intended recipients who do not constitute a closed category
of undertakings, the recipients may not directly challenge the decision.  On the
other hand, a body established under public law to represent those undertakings,
or a trade association, can have sufficient standing under article 173(2) if it
actively participated in the administrative proceedings before the Commission.
n94

   A more difficult question is whether competitors of the recipient of an aid
may challenge the aid by claiming that they will be prejudiced by the aid
measure.  In order to answer this question, one must first distinguish between
the challenge to a formal decision (subsequent to the contentious procedure),
and the challenge to a Commission authorization on the basis of the preliminary
assessment within the two-month period.

   3.  Types of Decisions Which May Be Challenged

   a.  Challenge to Formal Decisions

   With respect to the formal decision, the Court of Justice has applied the
same principle as it did in the context of competition and anti-dumping
proceedings.  In order to meet the article 173(2) requirement that the measure
be of direct and individual concern, two conditions must be satisfied: (1) the
undertaking must have participated in the Commission investigation into the
proposed aid.  Participation is likely to be found particularly where that
undertaking made the complaint which led to the opening of the investigation
procedure, or where it submitted its comments during the contentious procedure
laid down in article 93(2); and (2) where the position of that undertaking on
the market significantly is affected by the proposed aid.

    [*211]  If these requirements are met, the undertaking is entitled to
initiate proceedings under article 173(2) to challenge a decision authorizing
the aid.  n95 In Cdf Chimie Azf v. Commission, the Court of Justice, for the
first time, annulled a Commission decision authorizing an aid upon substantive
grounds where the action was brought by a third party.  n96

   b.  Challenge to Preliminary Assessments

   Until recently, the question of whether competing companies are entitled
under article 173(2) to appeal a Commission authorization of an aid after the
two-month investigation period has been the subject of controversy.  Three
recent decisions by the Court of Justice, however, have laid the controversy to
rest by confirming the right to such an appeal.  n97 In its test of direct and
individual concern in article 173(2), the Court did not require the plaintiff to
have participated in the Commission's preliminary two-month investigation, as it
did with respect to formal opinions.  This is not contradictory, since a notice
of a State aid is not published in the Official Journal and, very often,
competitors become aware of the preliminary investigation of an aid measure only
by chance.  Thus, it would be unfair to make the right to challenge the
preliminary authorization dependent upon the competitor's participation in the
investigation.

   B.  Remedies Before National Courts

   Article 93 provides that the Commission has the exclusive competence (subject
to Council actions in exceptional circumstances) to review State aid systems.
The Court of Justice concluded from this that article 92, which declares State
aids incompatible with the common market subject to a few exceptions, does not
have direct effect.  Consequently, it cannot be invoked by individuals in
proceedings before national courts.  n98 This is in contrast with article 85(2),
which provides national courts with the power to declare anti-competitive
arrangements void.

   While national courts may not directly rule on the propriety of State aids,
these courts may apply article 92 in certain circumstances.  This may occur when
a national court is presented with a challenge to a State  [*212]  aid under the
stand-still clause, contained in the last sentence of article 93(3), which is
the only part of articles 92 and 93 that has direct effect.  n99 The stand-still
clause prohibits a state from (1) putting an aid into effect without first
notifying the Commission, and (2) from putting a new aid system into effect
after notification, but before the Commission has ruled on its legality.  Since
this clause has direct effect, a private party can seek a declaration from a
national court that the implementation of an aid violates article 93(3).  The
national court then must decide whether the State measure concerned is an aid
within the meaning of article 92 before it can determine whether the State
breached the stand-still clause.  n100

   Until recently, it has been unclear what effect the breach of these
provisions has on the aid measures themselves.  With regard to the Commission
procedure under article 93(2), the Court of Justice held that the Commission is
not entitled to consider an aid illegal solely on the ground that the obligation
to notify was disregarded.  n101 The Commission still must examine the aid under
article 92.

   With regard to proceedings before national courts, in a recent case, FNCEPA
v. France,  n102 the Court of Justice took a different view.  In 1982, the
Commission initiated the article 93(2) procedure to determine the legality of a
French State aid measure in the fishery sector.  In April 1985, the French
government implemented the aid.  In October 1985, the Commission informed the
French government by an informal letter that it had no objections to the State
aid measure and intended to close the files.  Then, an action was brought
against France before a French court contesting the validity of the aid measure
since it was introduced in derogation of the stand-still obligation under the
last sentence of article 93(3).  The French Conseil d'Etat requested the Court
of Justice to give a preliminary ruling under article 177 on the decisive
question: is an aid measure which was implemented in violation of the
stand-still clause, remedied a posteriori if the Commission declares, in its
final decision, the aid measure compatible with the Common Market?

   The Court of Justice answered this question in the negative.  The Court held
that national courts must safeguard the rights of individuals against any
disregard of the stand-still obligation by taking -- in accordance with the
national law -- all appropriate measures, such as declaring  [*213]  the
implementation of the aid invalid, ordering the recovery of any aid already
paid, and other interim measures.  The Court went on to state that a subsequent
final Commission decision does not legalize a posteriori the invalid
implementation of the aid.  A contrary result, the Court reasoned, would
infringe upon the rights of individuals safeguarded by the above stated measures
of national courts, and would encourage Member States to disregard the
stand-still clause and deprive this provision of its effectiveness ("effet
utile").  n103

   This judgment considerably strengthens the possibility for private parties to
challenge a State aid measure implemented by the Member State in breach of the
stand-still clause.  National courts can now order recovery of the aid paid, and
order other interim measures, even when the article 93(2) procedure is still
pending before the Commission.  Such orders taken by a national court are valid
and cannot be revoked because the Commission, in a subsequent final decision,
declares the aid measure compatible with the Common Market.  Private parties,
especially competitors, may now challenge aid measures before national courts
with more efficiency and with less risk if they know that these aid measures
were not notified to the Commission, or were implemented prior to a final
Commission decision.  For the beneficiary of an aid, it is now even more
important to verify that the aid was notified by the Member State and that no
procedure under article 93(2) was opened by the Commission.

   CONCLUSION

   In its latest decisions, the Court of Justice has continued developing State
aid law and has provided clarification on some procedural aspects.  In Boussac,
n104 the Court strengthened the Commission's position with regard to State aids
implemented by Member States in breach of the stand-still clause in the last
sentence of article 93(3).  In FNCEPA v. Commission,  n105 the Court increased
the right of individuals to challenge aid measures before national courts which
were implemented by Member States in disregard of this stand-still clause.  The
Court's decision in British Aerospace and Rover v. Commission  n106 confirmed
the Court's requirement that the Commission strictly observe the procedural
rules.  Where the Commission has been given broad discretion, and where a
[*214]  complex economic assessment is involved, as is the case with regard to
State aid, competition, and antidumping cases, the Court of Justice is reluctant
to disturb the Commission's findings.  Thus, it is all the more important that
the procedural rights of the parties involved are strictly complied with.

   In recent years, the Commission's State aid policy has become more
understandable to the general public.  For example, the Commission now publishes
a summary of all cases dealt with in the Bulletin of the European Communities,
issues press releases in the more important cases, publishes all final decisions
in the Official Journal, and gives notice in the Official Journal of all cases
in which proceedings are initiated.  n107 Nevertheless, the procedural rights of
recipients of an aid are insufficient.  The recipients often do not know whether
the government which has given them aid has given notice to the Commission, even
though it is the recipients who will have to repay an illegally granted aid.
Even if they ascertain that notification has been made, they will not know what
objections the Commission has taken.  They do not know how complete the
notification has been and what arguments have been used to support it.
Moreover, there is no obligation for the Commission during the two-month
preliminary period to invite third parties, especially the recipients, to submit
their comments.  If the Commission decides to open the contentious procedure
they will not be informed individually.  There is no mandatory oral hearing
during the contentious procedure, and the recipients do not have access to the
Commission's files.  Thus, the system, as it presently stands, is unfair to the
aided party, especially in cases where the Commission examines an aid measure to
be granted to an individual undertaking.

   In order to strengthen the procedural rights of recipients and third parties,
a new regulation, based upon article 94, outlining the application of article
93(2) and (3), would be a solution.  Regulations No. 17/62, 27/62 and 99/63,
which govern the application of the competition rules, could provide the
necessary guidance.  n108

Five things you may not know about hearing aids

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 17

LENGTH: 703 words


Hearing aids - those two words alone may conjure up images of unattractive,
beige devices that your father or grandmother once wore before finally throwing
them in a drawer, never to be seen again. And who could blame them? In the past,
hearing aids were big, bulky and fragile - incapable of getting wet or dirty.
But hearing aids have come a very long way. Here are five things you may not
know about today's digital hearing aids:

1. Hearing aids can adjust automatically based on your listening situation
Digital hearing aids of the past required you to manually switch programs
depending on your environment (for example noisy vs. quiet). The latest hearing
aids are smart enough to recognize up to six distinct listening environments:
quiet, speech in quiet, noise, speech in noise, car or music.

The hearing aids continuously detect which of the six situations you're in and
automatically switch settings for the best hearing in that environment. No
manual adjustments are needed.

2. Hearing aids can act like your own personal headset Most people who have
hearing loss have it in both ears and need two hearing aids. Wireless hearing
aids talk with each other so touching the volume control or program switch for
one hearing aid automatically adjusts both.

Today's hearing aids are personal electronics that work with your high-tech
gadgets. You can wirelessly stream music into your hearing aids from an iPod,
hear a call that just came in on your smartphone, and listen to the television
with no delay at your preferred volume - without disturbing others.

3. You can swim, sweat and ski while wearing hearing aids In 2011, Aquaris, made
by Siemens, was the first digital waterproof, dustproof and shock-resistant
hearing aid. For high-school swimmer Kristle Cowan of Phoenix, a waterproof
hearing aid is life-changing.

"Before my waterproof hearing aids, I felt like quitting the swim team," says
17-year old Cowan.

"My old hearing aids couldn't get wet so I couldn't wear them in the pool. I
would be at a competition and get disqualified because I couldn't hear the
buzzer. Now I can hear everything."

Waterproof hearing aids aren't just for swimmers either. Because they are so
robust and stay securely in place behind the ear, many people can benefit,
including those who perspire heavily, are active in sports, or who garden or
work in dusty environments.

4. Hearing aids are rechargeable If the idea of having to change tiny batteries
once a week (or more) makes you cringe, you're not alone. With rechargeable
hearing aids, there's no more constant fumbling with batteries.

According to Dr. Gabrielle Filips of Siemens Hearing Instruments, people with
arthritis, Parkinson's disease or other conditions that create dexterity
problems can really struggle with opening battery packages, accessing a battery
compartment and guiding a battery into place.

Rechargeable hearing aids are also friendlier to the environment - and our
wallets. Over a three-year time span, two rechargeable hearing aids and a
charging station cost less than three year's worth of weekly disposable
batteries. They're easy to use, too.

At night, you place the hearing aids into a charger and every morning you'll
have freshly-charged hearing aids.

5. Hearing aids can be invisible Like contact lens wearers, most people still
want to be discreet about their hearing aids.

The stigma associated with wearing hearing aids still ranks among the top
reasons why consumers choose not to purchase them. But with invisible hearing
aids, only you know you're wearing the device.

Invisible and nearly-invisible hearing aids like Siemens Eclipse are very
comfortable, too.

According to Filips, because they sit closer to the ear drum, they provide a
more natural sound quality without a muffled or over-amplified effect.

And, in case you were wondering, a tiny, transparent removal cord lets the
wearer safely remove the hearing aids anytime - without having to see a
professional.

With all these advances, it's no wonder hearing aid wearers are happier and more
satisfied than ever.

In fact, the technology may give some wearers an advantage over those without
hearing loss. So make that appointment to get your hearing checked that you've
been putting off.

Japan needs to build up aid expertise and shift focus to humanitarian grants

I recently had the opportunity to join a field research team looking into
possibilities for reform in Japan's foreign aid program.

Our investigations took us to Germany and the U.K., two leading aid doners, as
well as India, Indonesia and Thailand, which are among the world's largest aid
recipients.

The most striking discovery, for me, was just how inadequate Japan's logistics
and systems for carrying out its aid is, compared with those of Germany and the
U.K., even though Japan now gives out more foreign aid than any other donor.

Officials at Germany's Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation, for example,
complained that aid decision-making authority in Japan is scattered among a
number of ministries and agencies.  They noted that even if they wanted to
confer with the Japanese on aid activities, they would not know whom to contact.

Until the 1960s, authority for aid decisions in the German government was also
split up between a number of agencies.  A German aid official noted with pride,
however, that these were eventually merged into the current Economic Cooperation
Ministry, and that this structural reform made it possible to achieve a
consistent, coordinated aid policy.  He claimed that the time has come for Japan
to put its aid structure under one roof, as well.

Another point that often came up in our discussions is the small number of aid
experts to be found in Japanese agencies, compared with their Western
counterparts.

Nicholas C. Hope, director of the World Bank's office in Indonesia, noted with
astonishment that while the World Bank has a local staff of 52 to implement a
little over $ 1.5 billion per year in aid projects, Japan's Overseas Economic
Cooperation Fund has only three or four staffers to handle an annual budget of $
1.2 billion.

He expressed serious doubts that the Japanese could carry out sufficient project
evaluation and maintenance in an appropriate way with such a small number of
people.

In general, the total number of Japanese aid personnel is said to be about one
fourth that of the U.K.  If aid is to be carried out conscientiously and with an
adequate understanding of circumstances in the recipient country, the Japanese
government must increase the ranks of its aid experts.

Another key feature of Japanese aid is that, to a great extent, it is
concentrated in large projects such as dams and roads.

At the same time, the share of humanitarian aid such as food and medicine, which
is emphasized by German and British aid policy, is relatively small.  The
countries of the West are strongly urging Japan to increase its aid in these
areas.

This is especially true for Germany, whose fiscal resources will be severely
strained in the years ahead by the need to rescue the economies of eastern
Germany, the Soviet Union and Eastern European nations.

As a result, German officials fear that they will not be able to keep up their
past levels of humanitarian aid to the poorest nations of Africa.  They hope
that Japan will be willing to take on some of this aid burden.

Behind these expectations, however, lies a basic dissatisfaction with Japan's
current way of giving aid.

This is not the highly emotional criticism, heard all too often, that Japan's
aid is provided solely for the benefit of Japanese companies.

Rather, Japanese aid is accused of concentrating too much on the "efficient"
sectors of the economy.

By way of contrast, the basis of Britain's aid philosophy is "More Help for the
Poorest." This finds its roots in traditional Christian charity.

As a result, British aid consists exclusively of grants that need not be repaid.
Implementing this sort of aid, moreover, requires a great deal of time and
effort.

In order to provide food and medical aid to the poorest nations, a massive
amount of human energy must be devoted to such tasks as gaining access to remote
areas, gathering information and transporting materials.  Many people and
extensive specialized knowledge are requited in proportion to the amount of
money spent.

In addition, such aid leaves very few tangible signs as to how much it has
contributed to the development of the recipient country.  This is clearly not an
efficient form of aid.

Japanese aid, on the contrary, seeks chiefly to promote the autonomous
development of the recipient country.  Emphasis has been placed on aid loans to
finance large projects.

As can be seen from the astonishing economic development in the ASEAN countries
in recent years, Japanese aid has proven highly successful and, to this effect,
it can be said that it has been spent "efficiently."

If one is trying to build something, efficiency is the ultimate objective.  In
this sense, the relative efficiency of Japanese aid deserves high marks.

Given the fact that Japan has become the world's leading aid power, however, I
feel it should now shift the weight of its aid program toward "inefficient"
humanitarian grants.

Due to changes in global politics, Japan is being called upon to contribute in
many different ways to world peace and prosperity.  Aid represents the trucard
of Japan's international contribution, through which it could earn great favor
with the global community.

As indicated by the difficulties it faced in trying to respond to the Gulf
crisis, Japan cannot and perhaps should not actively support military actions to
resolve international conflict.

For this reason, Japan must carry out its international responsibilities through
non-military activities.  At the center of these lies aid policy.  The Japanese
government must recognize this fact and move more boldly into "inefficient"
humanitarian aid.

Finally, another key area Japan should emphasize in the future is the
development of human resources in aid recipient countries.  Specifically, the
Japanese could share their expertise in on-the-job training, which has been a
principal factor behind the international competitiveness of Japanese
corporations.  The teaching of Japanese manpower training techniques to firms in
recipient countries could make a valuable contribution to their development.

As noted above, however, these objectives cannot be achieved without providing
the necessary logistics for aid policy.  These include unifying the fragmented
bureaucracies under one roof and mobilizing a substantial force of aid experts.

Chapter VII Supplementary Articles

Article 63 The following terms used in the regulations have the following
meanings:

AIDS refers to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome caused by the human
immunodeficiency virus (the AIDS virus).

Medication maintenance treatment for drug addicts refers to maintenance
treatment administered with appropriate medications to drug addicts by medical
and health institutions that have been approved to undertake drug rehabilitation
services in order to lessen dependence on narcotics, reduce HIV infection and
transmission caused by injected drug use, and reduce diseases, deaths, and
crimes caused by drug addiction.

Standard principles of protection refer to medical personnel treating the blood
and other body fluids of all patients as well as articles contaminated by blood
and other body fluids as pathogenic substances. When coming in contact with
these substances, medical personnel must take protective measures.

People at risk of contracting HIV refer to those who provide sex services, visit
prostitutes, have multiple sexual partners, and engage in gay sex practices and
those who inject drugs or engage in other dangerous behaviour.

AIDS surveillance refers to the continuous and systematic collection of data on
the distribution of AIDS (HIV infections) and related factors among various
groups of people and the comprehensive analysis of these data in order to
provide relevant departments with timely and reliable information and bases for
drawing up prevention and control strategies and measures, as well as the
evaluation of the results of prevention and control measures.

AIDS tests refer to laboratory tests for HIV, HIV antibodies, and relevant
immunity indices performed on human blood, other body fluids, tissues, organs,
and blood derivatives, including AIDS tests involved in surveillance,
inspections and quarantine, voluntary counselling and testing, clinical
diagnoses, and the screening of blood and blood products.

Behavioural intervention measures refer to various measures that can effectively
reduce the transmission of AIDS, including measures such as methadone
maintenance treatment that target the transmission of AIDS through injected drug
use; measures for popularizing the use of condoms to combat sexually transmitted
AIDS; standard and convenient measures for diagnosing and treating sexually
transmitted diseases; measures that target mother-to-child AIDS transmission
such as antiretroviral prophylaxis and feeding with artificial milk products;
voluntary counselling and testing measures for people whose infections are
detected early and measures that can help change dangerous behaviour; health
education measures; and education measures targeting sexual partners that seek
to raise individual awareness of relevant norms of behaviour and reduce
dangerous behaviour.

Article 64 These regulations shall take effect on 1 March 2006. Several
Provisions on AIDS Surveillance and Management approved by the State Council on
26 December 1987 and promulgated by the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Public Security, the former State Education
Commission, the National Tourism Administration, the former China Civil Aviation
Bureau, and the State Bureau of Foreign Experts on 14 January 1988 shall be
abrogated at the same time.

Resource crisis   Care of AIDS patients takes toll among doctors, health
services

BY  JOAN BRECKENRIDGE
 The Globe and Mail
  Shortages. Burnout. Fear.

Weary health-care officials use these words to describe the impact AIDS
is having on North America's health system and they predict that an
already intolerable situation will reach crisis proportions.

In the United States, some major urban centres have run out of hospital
beds and of medical staff willing to care for people with acquired immune
deficiency syndrome. Sick and destitute people with AIDS are being forced
on to the street.

In Canada and the United States, a small number of overworked
physicians and specialists are caring for all people with AIDS. So
demanding are AIDS patients that those who treat them find it almost
impossible to cope personally and professionally.

Canadian health officials predict that hospitals in large cities will
soon be overwhelmed by demands for beds and services as regional hospitals
refer all AIDS patients to big-city specialists.

The steadily increasing cost of AIDS is straining already overextended
health-care budgets. The projected cost of AIDS to the Canadian health-
care system is $500-million a year by 1992.

In the United States, economists are expecting a staggering $37-billion
annual AIDS health bill by mid-1991. The cost might even go as high as
$113-billion if there is a big increase in the number of AIDS patients or
in health costs.

"We're going to have a terrible crisis," predicts Dr. Mathilde Krim,
founding chairman of the American Foundation For AIDS Research in New
York.

"The people who deal with AIDS patients are suffering from burnout,"
Dr. Krim said. Too few doctors and nurses routinely care for thousands of
people with AIDS.

The stress can be overwhelming. There is little that can be done to
help someone suffering from the illness, and the majority die. Some
doctors and nurses are leaving AIDS for other areas of medicine.

"The doctors out there are just frantic. They're facing battle
fatigue," said Dr. Norbert Gilmore, chairman of the Canadian Government's
National Advisory Committee On AIDS.

"Everyone is feeling burned out, but I don't think anyone has stopped
seeing AIDS patients," said Dr. Philip Berger, spokesman for the HIV
Primary Care Physicians Group in Toronto.

In Toronto, about 25 general practitioners and about a dozen
specialists in the major teaching hospitals are caring for about 150 AIDS
patients. An additional 226 patients have already died.

"You can see the crisis of practice saturation right now," Dr. Berger
said.

Like many physicians, he has told referring agencies that he can no
longer take new AIDS patients. Others are dropping patients who do not
have AIDS so they can focus exclusively on those who do.

There is a lack of doctors who are either prepared or willing to take
up the slack. Many still fear the illness because of a continued lack of
AIDS education for doctors. Homophobia is a major deterrent.

"Ninety-five per cent of doctors have never even seen an AIDS patient,"
said Dr. Iain Mackie, a member of the Ontario Public Education Panel on
AIDS and a professor of clinical medicine at the University of Western
Ontario.

He believes this situation would not exist if AIDS was a disease that
had originally affected heterosexuals.

"If AIDS had hit nice little old ladies, there would have been a lot of
interest in it on the part of medical people," said Dr. Mackie from his
office in London, Ont. Instead, the burden of patient care is being borne
by a handful of dedicated physicians.

Dr. Berger said many doctors "are still as mystified by the disease as
the public is."

Dr. Krim said: "Not only are they scared, they have no experience with
AIDS, so they're at a loss at how to handle them" (AIDS patients).

"It also doesn't pay," Dr. Gilmore said. "You can see half a dozen
runny noses in the time it takes to see one AIDS patient."

AIDS patients take substantially more time to examine, need more
follow-up and require more paperwork, especially if they are participating
in a clinical trial of an experimental drug.

Many young residents in large New York teaching hospitals now refuse to
work with AIDS patients, Dr. Krim said. They say they are concerned they
will end up exclusively focusing on AIDS and not gain experience with
other illnesses.

Right now, the AIDS-patient load is being carried by the handful of
large teaching hospitals in major urban centres. They are reaching the
breaking point, even though there are not a huge number of AIDS patients
in Canada. AIDS patients are admitted to hospital frequently and they
require a lot of care.

In a recently published report, the Royal Society of Canada estimated
that on any given day there are 100 to 150 AIDS patients in hospital in
Canada. More than 80 per cent are cared for in Toronto, Vancouver and
Montreal.

"Every major hospital in the major centres of the country is really
overwhelmed by the whole problem," said Dr. Stanley Read, an infectious-
disease specialist at Toronto's Hospital For Sick Children.

AIDS patients are taking up a lot of beds and are taxing outpatient
facilities. The additional costs are stretching hospital budgets to the
limit. Hospitals are still having to deal with the fear AIDS causes staff
members.

A Royal Society of Canada report entitled AIDS: A Perspective For
Canadians found that it costs $82,500 a year to treat an AIDS patient from
the time of diagnosis to death. AIDS patients can be admitted to hospital
three or four times a year.

"There's been a tremendous strain placed on hospital resources," said
Dr. Douglas McFadden, director of immunology at Toronto Western Hospital.
Instruments can be tied up for days to make sure they are properly
sterilized.

"Almost always, AIDS patients are admitted to private rooms," Dr.
McFadden said. If a private room is not available, a room with two beds
can end up being occupied by one AIDS patient.

The number of beds - generally in short supply - needed by AIDS
sufferers will continue to rise. St. Joseph's Health Centre in London,
Ont., expects one-quarter of its medical beds will be filled with AIDS
patients by 1992, Dr. Mackie said. The hospital expects to see about 500
AIDS patients annually by 1992.

Dr. McFadden said Toronto Western already allocates about 10 per cent
of its 230 medical beds to this group. He said he did not know how much
this percentage would increase in the future.

Although there is much less fear among staff about AIDS, there are
still those who are afraid of dealing with AIDS patients no matter how
much reassuring information the hospitals provide.

"They're always scared we're going to tell them something new about
transmission of the disease," Dr. Mackie said. Some still insist they
should have the right to wear a mask, gown and gloves when they go into an
AIDS patient's room.

The recent publication of a controversial book about AIDS by Masters
and Johnson brought old doubts to the surface. The highly respected duo
made some startling statements such as that AIDS can be transmitted from
toilet seats.

"I'd like to strangle those guys," Dr. Read said. "They caused a
tremendous amount of trouble. People are coming back to me and saying, 'Is
there something you haven't told us?' "
   Dr. Read believes the fear of AIDS within the medical profession is
going to continue for a long time.

The other problems being encountered will also continue unless ways can
be found to persuade primary-care physicians and specialists to care for
at least some AIDS patients. The health-care system needs more money.

Provincial governments are reluctant to put money into an illness that
does not affect a large number of people, Dr. Gilmore said.

"The bottom line is it's a political liability to go at it too
strongly."

Dr. Berger predicts the end result will be substandard medical care for
AIDS patients. Overworked physicians and hospital outpatient clinics will
not be able properly to monitor and treat those who are ill.

At Toronto Western, Dr. McFadden said, there is a push on to get
doctors interested in caring for AIDS patients because "there is no doubt
that our health-care system is going to be totally overwhelmed by people
with AIDS within the next five years."

   * DIRECTOR -- AFRICAN STUDIES PROGRAM, GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY FORMER DEPUTY
ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AFRICA

 LEXISNEXIS SUMMARY:
 ...  Actually, I am not going to talk about the legislation at all. ...  I
suggested that they must be under a lot of pressure to increase the allocation
of these commodities in the food aid program. ...  In the early years of the
food aid program, which began in 1954, surplus disposal or supply management was
a very important objective.  In the 1970's, the food aid program was discovered
by the foreigners who were notedly established, especially those looking for
tools to advance United States political interests abroad. ...  We may not be
doing them any favor by expanding food aid in place of dollar aid if the food
aid would inhibit their long run agricultural development. ...  Falling world
food prices resulting from our own agricultural policy failures can be
devastating to the producers of these goods abroad. ... Under Title I of Public
Law 480, the Food Aid Legislation, congressional financing is provided countries
for an eligible list of commodities. ...  Generally, this is export promotion
rather than food aid and has not really overlapped or conflicted, but there are
a couple of exceptions, for example, Zaire. ...  If we provide food aid in the
form of rice to an Asian country, we are probably going to have to talk to the
Thai government first. ...

TEXT:
 [*311]  Actually, I am not going to talk about the legislation at all.  What I
am going to talk about is how the United States Food Program works.  I want to
start out by keying my comment to something Dirck Stryker said.  I think he is
making a case for a more rational, regularized supply of U.S. food aid.  I am
going to tell you why the supply of food aid appears irrational and irregular
and what can be done about the irrationality and irregularity.  I am going to
start out by telling a story.  A couple of years ago I called up some of my
former colleagues in the Office of Management and Budget where I used to work.
Whenever I really want to know what is going on in this town, I call them up.  I
told them "you guys must be under a lot of pressure." I had just been reading
about problems of surplus rice and corn production.  I suggested that they must
be under a lot of pressure to increase the allocation of these commodities in
the food aid program.  They replied that they were indeed under a lot of
pressure.  When I asked which countries they could ship additional rice to, they
replied that the Department of Agriculture had identified Peru as a place to
possibly put some P.L. 480 rice.  Rice prices had been going up in Peru and that
might suggest a demand for extra rice there.  A little while later when I was
trying to contact an economist I knew, someone in AID told me that person had
just left on a mission to Peru to persuade the Peruvians that they should raise
their rice prices in order to encourage an expansion in rice production there.

   Policies reflected in this story do not seem rational.  However, they do
reflect the nature of our food aid program, which is that our food aid program
has multiple objectives.  What are those objectives?  Some of them have been
mentioned by Dirck Stryker.  They include promoting development in recipient
countries, however that is defined.  There is a humanitarian objective, that is
relieving serious deficits in  [*312]  food, resulting from man-made or natural
catastrophes.  There are political objectives in providing food aid.  The
largest single recipient of food aid right now is Egypt; and that is a result of
the role Egypt played in the Camp David peace process.  Similarly, the large
proportions of United States food aid allocated to Indochina in the 70's was in
support of our interests in Vietnam and Cambodia at that time.  There is the
objective of market development, i.e., the provision of food aid to develop
future markets for United States exports.  A very good example of the successful
use of food aid for this objective is our provision of feed.  Finally, as has
already been mentioned, there is the objective of surplus disposal, or if you
like, supply management.  The objectives have shifted a little bit over time,
partly reflecting changing circumstances internationally, changing circumstances
in the United States and changing influence of the various players in the food
program.  In the early years of the food aid program, which began in 1954,
surplus disposal or supply management was a very important objective.  In the
1970's, the food aid program was discovered by the foreigners who were notedly
established, especially those looking for tools to advance United States
political interests abroad.  More recently, the United States use of food aid to
promote development in recipient countries appears to have become a more
prominent objective of the program.

   The supply management and market development elements in food aid are no
longer so important.  That is not to suggest that farmers no longer support food
aid.  They still see it as a vehicle for reducing surpluses.

   These objectives are not always mutually consistent.  Sometimes they are
contradictory as the story I told suggested.  You can imagine yourself some of
the contradictions.  If you are eager to push foreign countries to accept
certain bundles of food aid and you are interested in promoting their production
of the same commodities, you can face contradiction.  You can see where a United
States' commitment to provide food aid to Egypt, for strongly political reasons,
probably limits the ability of the United States to use food aid as leverage for
agricultural policy, which is one of the ways it is used these days to promote
development.  In short, the objectives of food aid can defeat one another if
they are not carefully monitored.

   Reflecting the multiple objectives of food aid are the multiplicity  [*313]
of players in food aid allocation.  This is what makes the food aid program
bureaucratic.  I have filled a number of these roles, so I can speak with true
schizophrenia about this.  The food aid program's decision on country
allocations and decisions on overall annual budget levels are made by a number
of agencies.  The food aid budget is part of the Department of Agriculture's
budget and the Department of Agriculture plays a very key role in most
decisions.  The State Department also influences program decisions, usually from
the standpoint of United States foreign policy interests abroad.  The agency for
International Development gets involved in food aid decisions.  The Office of
Management and Budget gets involved in food aid decisions from a budgetary point
of view.  The food aid program largely reflects budgetary concerns and operates
on a pro-cyclinal basis, not a counter-cyclinal basis.  That means that when
food is cheap and in large supply world-wide, there is usually more food aid
available.  When food is in short supply or expensive, there is less food aid
available.  The food aid budget is submitted eighteen months in advance in
dollar amounts and there is a good budgetary reason for this apparent
irrationality are the controlling element in the budget for food aid.  However,
what crops are going to cost at the time of allocation cannot be predicted.  If
there's an unexpected shortage in harvested crops, prices can go up and the
originally budgeted dollar level will fund less food aid.  If the reverse takes
place, you can figure out what happens.  There can of course be supplemental
requests to Congress for additional appropriations to finance food aid in times
of shortage.  But at that time, political forces can move against more food aid,
based on a concern about further increasing food prices.  This problem has eased
in recent years with the creation of an emergency reserve of food aid.  However,
it has been with great reluctance that the Administration has drawn on this
reserve.  There is also a provision in the new farm bill which allows the
government on an off budget basis to buy and ship as much food as it wants
abroad.  This provision has not been much used; but it could be an opening for
using food aid more flexibly.  Finally, there is the ongoing debate about the
impact of food aid on development, specifically whether food aid has acted as a
disincentive to agricultural development and agricultural production in
recipient countries.

   Food aid clearly has the potential for inhibiting development if a large
amount of food is provided and so depresses prices in recipient  [*314]
countries.  Food aid can also ease pressures on recipient governments need for
reforms.  The question that is often debated in Washington is how can food aid
be used more effectively for development.  One way that Congress and the
Administration have tried to make food aid a more effective tool in promoting
development is to increase the grant element in it; to waive repayments of food
aid loans when recipient governments undertake agreed policies.  Another way
food aid has often been used for development is through programming local
currency generations.  When food aid is provided to another government, that
government often sells it in their home markets and receives payment in the
local currency.  The donor and recipient government can jointly decide how those
currencies are going to be used.

   Food aid is relatively easy to get out of Congress.  It is worth bearing in
mind that food aid has a special domestic political advantage.  Farmers like it
and therefore, there is a real political constituency in this country for food
aid which hardly exists for other forms of aid.  It is also appropriated by the
agricultural appropriations committee, not the foreign aid appropriations
committee, also an advantage for food aid.  Thus, food aid does not get caught
up in aid controversies and the reluctance by members of Congress to vote in
favor of foreign aid.  Thus, it should not be thought that if food were
eliminated, dollar aid could be increased by the same amount.  The dangerous
temptation facing us now is that, as our dollar aid program decreases with the
sharp cuts made by Congress last year, there is an effort to increase food aid
to offset cuts in dollar aid.  I think in many ways that is a dangerous
temptation to give into.  One has to look very carefully into the needs of the
recipient countries and how they would use the food aid.  We may not be doing
them any favor by expanding food aid in place of dollar aid if the food aid
would inhibit their long run agricultural development.  There is further
limitation in using food aid to promote development.  It is often thought that
food aid can be usefully utilized for nutrition intervention, school feeding,
material child help and food for work, and that is true.  But there are real
limits on how much food aid can be distributed in this way.  It can be expansive
logistically and administratively to the groups distributing it.

   The real threat to the agriculture of poorer countries of the world right now
is one that is broader than those deriving from the limitations of food aid.  We
have enormous agricultural surpluses in this  [*315]  country.  Europeans have
the same thing.  We are competing to get rid of them.  We are doing things in
order to expand our export markets, such as using export to reduce world food
prices.  Falling world food prices resulting from our own agricultural policy
failures can be devastating to the producers of these goods abroad.  We can
discourage development abroad through the way we manage our surpluses.

   Another problem is reflected in Congressional legislation, such as the
Bumpers amendment which limits the ability of the United States to support
agricultural research interpreted, this could mean an elimination of research on
many major food crops produced in African countries.  These are among the issues
in agricultural development we should be focusing on, one really ought to focus
on it if we are concerned about eliminating hunger in the developing world.

   CHAIR -- HOWARD HELLMAN

   Thank you Carol.  I think you gave everyone a realistic view of the
situation.  The Bumpers amendment has passed and we are faced with the problem.
In fact, in this years' cycle of project reviews at AID, it was a major concern
in some of the projects.  I would like to take one second before we take
questions to run and various components of legislation to complement Carol's
presentation.

   Under Title I of Public Law 480, the Food Aid Legislation, congressional
financing is provided countries for an eligible list of commodities.

   Under Title II, you have grant assistance.  Normally that is used primarily
for an emergency or for reaching the poorest population groups.  It is also used
as a vehicle by which PO's distribute the food on a free basis within the
countries.  The food is normally not sold (monetized); the provisions of section
206 control monetization of donational to governments, other than for
emergencies.  Because of the attractiveness of monetizing grant food aid, the
potential cost of that program is high and OMB has seriously limited
applications for monetized grant assistance.  In essence, that provision is
being used at only a fraction of its potential.

   Then you have Title III which permits the convertability of credit assistance
to grant assistance for food aid and again the use of that has been quite
limited.  Title III permits conversion to grant where the proceeds are used
under tight restrictions for development purposes.  There  [*316]  is also the
year old legislation for introducing a "food for progress" program in which food
assistance is provided as a grant in exchange for negotiated, or in recognition
of, policy reform.  This program is popular, but is still small.

   This year, with the very large amount of food that is potentially available,
there is likely to be an increase in monetized programs.  The use of food
assistance for structural adjustment programs under section 106 is also a new
way to use food assistance under existing legislation.

   Then there is the export enhancement program under which we have encouraged
private commercial sales.  Generally, this is export promotion rather than food
aid and has not really overlapped or conflicted, but there are a couple of
exceptions, for example, Zaire.

   From Carol's presentation, it is clear that the number of players and the
kinds of decision making involved doesn't lend itself to a single overview of
the situation from a common vantage point.  You are going to have a combination
of a rationale or strategies and a devolution of responsibility to a number of
institutions and the piece by piece playout as the scenario occurs.  It seems to
me, given the trade deficits, the balance of payment problems, the United States
food surplus and the United States future commercial interests associated with
foreign economic development in countries that could be potential food markets,
the time has never been more important than today to try to get consistency in
what we are doing, particularly in clarifying the objectives for players
responsible for the different elements in this legislation.

Questions and Answers

   QUESTION

   I'm Renee Yates from the Treasury Department.  This is more of a comment
directed at Carol.  About the number of agencies involved in the food allocation
process, she forgot the Treasury Department which is very much involved in this
also.  Because of the growing indebtedness of a number of the African countries,
there is a need to consider this as part of the financial situation.  The other
reason is because of the growing tendency to use food as balance of payment
support, as packages get smaller and smaller, there is increasing need  [*317]
to try to position the food next to various bank fund packages and so on, for
structural adjustments purposes.  I just wanted to add that because it is an
important point.

   ANSWER

   I would like to add that you are very right.  Is there anyone here from the
Commerce Department, IMF Bank, Riverside Investment Corporation, the National
Security Council or anybody else?  The point is that the agencies that get
involved are larger than I mentioned.  Some of them are more involved than
others.  The Treasury certainly has a very important role, particularly
considering the fact that, of the $ 1.8 billion in food aid that is funded every
year, nearly a third of that comes back in receipts from earlier food aid
programs that are repaid.  If you go look at the federal budget, the actual
appropriated levels of food aid are closer to $ 900 million more or less, Renee
you probably have the figures on that.  That is a very interesting element.  I
know in the old days, when I was working with the food aid program, nobody
looked at the indebtedness.  We didn't know how they were going to pay for it.
We really weren't worried actually.  That was tomorrow's problem perhaps, but
the Treasury has played a role.  I'm glad you corrected me.

   QUESTION

   Given the increasing surpluses of food, how is it going to be distributed
among the Titles and the food for peace program?

   ANSWER

   There is an assumption there that I really don't agree with and that is that
the surpluses will be distributed.  I suspect that there is going to be a very
great effort on the part of various elements in the administration to keep the
food aid program from going too far.  The other limitation is on commercial
imports of the recipient countries and you have to take into account third party
exports.  If we provide food aid in the form of rice to an Asian country, we are
probably going to have to talk to the Thai government first.  We want to make
sure that we don't interfere with their markets.  So, and as Dirck said, the
Indians are now no longer receiving food aid; they were a major recipient.  The
[*318]  Indonesians were major recipients at one time.  The big markets are
pretty much gone, with the exception of Egypt, from the program.  There are
limits on how much, unless you really want to go out there and aggresively dump
this stuff, there are limits to how much the United States can actually get rid
of, legally and rationally.  But anyway, if there were extra how would it be
distributed?  It is hard to say.  There is often a lot of pressure from private
voluntary organizations to raise that level of the Title 2 program, the food aid
grant that is given to them to be distributed.  On the other hand, it is easier
to use food aid for a lot of other purposes, be they developmental or political
or whatever, when they go through the Title 1 program to make government to
government concessional sales.  I think one would have to be in the middle of it
at the time to tell, but it would also depend on the commodities.  We use
different commodities under Title 1 than we do under Title 2.

   QUESTION

   I wondered if it would be possible for lawyers to quickly bring cases before
the international court with respect to the political use of food aid or the
withholding of food aid.  For instance, in 1983, seed shipments were withheld
from Mozambique at the time they were involved in a very serious famine because
of political reasons.  Tool is also being given to places like Liberia, even
though they are gross violators of human rights, also for political reasons.  Is
there grounds or a history of legal action for that kind of thing?

   ANSWER

   GOLER T. BUTCHER

   I think there are two problems here.  One is that only states may be parties
before the International Court.  Individuals, even in this era of the 1980's,
when we've come out of the dark ages where international law didn't recognize
individuals at all, cannot be parties before the court.  The other problem
relates to the fact that even if a state, that is a country, were desirous of
bringing a case before the International Court the jurisdiction of the court is
consensual.  As we all know, in the action by Nicaragua against the United
States, with respect to our mining its ports, the United States has withdrawn
its acceptance  [*319]  of the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court.  We will go
into the next panel now.

AHF: Magic Johnson, Blair Underwood Endorse 2012 AIDS March on Washington

LENGTH: 1291  words


New Delhi, Oct. 18 -- AIDS Healthcare Foundation issued the following news
release:

AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF) is honored to announce that business mogul and
basketball legend Earvin 'Magic' Johnson, Jr. and actor and AIDS advocate Blair
Underwood have each signed on to individually endorse the 'Keep the Promise on
HIV/AIDS' March set to take place in Washington, DC, Sunday, July 22, 2012
immediately before the opening ceremonies of the International AIDS Society's
XIX International AIDS Conference, which is being held in the United States for
the first time in more than 20 years. The 'Keep the Promise' rally and
march-which organizers anticipate will draw thousands of participants-will serve
as a clarion call for universal access to AIDS care and treatment; for more
efficient use of the limited funding from sources including the Global Fund and
PEPFAR; for big world economies and the G20 to fully fund the Global Fund as
well as for the lowering of AIDS drug prices by pharmaceutical companies to
allow for the treatment of more patients with the same amount of money.

Johnson and Underwood join over 2,000 other individuals and 1,088 organizations
from 78 countries-including the Magic Johnson Foundation-that have signed on to
the 'Keep the Promise' Declaration.

"We are honored to announce that Magic Johnson and Blair Underwood are among our
first individual celebrity endorsers of the 2012 'Keep the Promise on HIV/AIDS'
declaration, march and rally in Washington. Mr. Johnson and Mr. Underwood-both
respected longtime HIV/AIDS advocates in their own right-join over 1,000
organizations from around the world and more than 2,000 individuals who have
endorsed the 'Keep the Promise' Declaration and march and rally," said Terri
Ford, Senior Director of Global Advocacy and Policy for AIDS Healthcare
Foundation, and who has spearheaded similar AIDS treatment advocacy marches in
conjunction with the opening of three previous International AIDS Conferences
(Barcelona, 2002; Toronto, 2006; and Mexico City, 2008). "The 'AIDS 2012
Declaration,'-a key component of this current advocacy effort-outlines domestic
and global concerns of many AIDS advocates and offers a collective commitment to
specific actions and solutions to help address these concerns so that we may all
truly 'keep the promise on HIV/AIDS'."

"For the first time in over twenty years, the International AIDS Conference
takes place in the United States-in Washington-and just a few months before the
2012 presidential election," said Michael Weinstein, President of AIDS
Healthcare Foundation. "The 'Keep the Promise on HIV/AIDS' March presents an
ideal opportunity for AIDS advocates and organizations the world over to join
together and have our collective voices heard to press US and world leaders to
do the right thing on AIDS funding, care and treatment."

The 2012 'Keep the Promise on HIV/AIDS' March includes a global coalition of
founding supporters that have signed on and endorsed the 'Keep the Promise'
Declaration, which states:

AIDS 2012 Declaration: 'Keep the Promise on HIV/AIDS'

WHEREAS Globally:

* Every day AIDS claims 5,000 lives.

* Over 14 million people with AIDS are not receiving the treatment they need,
and 2 million die each year as a result.

* Less than 40% of people living with HIV in low- and middle-income countries
have been tested for HIV and know their status.

* Millions of people affected by HIV/AIDS do not have adequate access to housing
and healthcare.

* 16 million children have been orphaned by AIDS, and each year over 400,000 are
still born HIV-positive.

* Only 26% of all tuberculosis (YB) patients are tested for HIV globally and
only a third access antiretroviral treatment (ART).

* Access to condoms, the most cost-effective prevention tool, remains
inconsistent and inadequate.

* The global response to HIV/AIDS is facing a multi-billion dollar shortfall.

WHEREAS in the United States:

* The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) spends less than 30% of its HIV
prevention budget on HIV testing.

* Over 8,600 low-income people have been placed on waiting lists or disenrolled
from AIDS Drug Assistance Programs (ADAP).

* The average cost of AIDS medications in the U.S. has increased by 163% over
the past 15 years, putting an increased financial burden on ADAP and other
programs.

* Washington, DC, the host city of the 2012 International AIDS Conference has
one of the highest HIV prevalence rates in the country at 3%.

THEREFORE:

As HIV/AIDS advocates, we declare our commitment to the following:

* United States must fulfill its commitment to the President's Emergency Plan
for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) from $6.8 billion (FY 2010) to $10 billion per year.

* The percentage of PEPFAR funding spent on ART must be increased from 24% to
33%.

* Administrative waste and the cost of HIV care must be contained at less than
$300 per patient per year to treat more people with available resources.

* Access to healthcare and housing for people affected by HIV/AIDS is a vital
component of a response to the epidemic.

* Testing, treatment and care for orphans and vulnerable children (OVCs) must be
prioritized.

* People living with HIV should be routinely screened for TB, receive
preventative therapy and be put on TB-HIV treatment in case of co-infection. All
TB patients should be regularly tested for HIV.

* Sufficient funding must be secured to eliminate ADAP waiting lists in the US
and provide affordable treatment to all who need it.

* Pharmaceutical companies must lower AIDS drug prices so that more people can
access lifesaving ART.

* Big world economies and the G20 must fully fund the Global Fund to Fight AIDS,
Tuberculosis and Malaria and pay their fair share.

* Economic, political and logistical barriers to universal condom access must be
overcome.

* Universal Access to rapid HIV testing, treatment and care must be achieved
through cost-effective measures and fair-share contributions to the global fight
against AIDS.

We call on all AIDS leaders and advocates to pledge to these goals at the 2012
International AIDS Conference in Washington D.C.

Background on the 2012 XIX International AIDS Conference

According to the website of the International AIDS Society, "The return of the
International AIDS Conference to the United States in July 2012 represents a
significant victory for public health and human rights. The selection of
Washington, DC as the site for the XIX International AIDS Conference (AIDS 2012)
is the result of years of dedicated advocacy to end the nation's misguided entry
restrictions on people living with HIV - restrictions that were based on fear,
rather than science.

The biennial International AIDS Conference is the premier gathering for those
working in the field of HIV, as well as policymakers, people living with HIV and
others committed to ending the epidemic. It will be a tremendous opportunity for
researchers from around the world to share the latest scientific advances in the
field, learn from one another's expertise, and develop strategies for advancing
all facets of our collective efforts to treat and prevent HIV.

AIDS 2012 is expected to convene more than 25,000 delegates from nearly 200
countries, including more than 2,500 journalists. The conference will be held
from 22 to 27 July 2012 at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center. The
International AIDS Society, the world's leading independent association of HIV
professionals, with 14,000 members in 190 countries, will organize AIDS 2012 in
collaboration with our international and local partners."

Fear, prejudice still common reactions to HIV/AIDS

BYLINE: LORI JACOB

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. B5

LENGTH: 918 words


On Aug. 17, The Tribune ran an editorial as a follow-up to its four-part report
on the status of HIV/AIDS in the Michiana community. The editorial stated the
need for a concerted effort to expand awareness, testing and education regarding
HIV and AIDS issues in the community.

AIDS Ministries/AIDS Assist has been addressing these issues since 1989. Working
with our county health departments, local hospitals and human service agencies,
AIDS Ministries/AIDS Assist has been providing education, testing and service to
the Michiana community for nearly 20 years. A shortage of volunteers, reductions
in grant funding and nearly non-existent donor support makes our work especially
challenging.

AIDS Ministries/AIDS Assist began as a response to a need in Michiana. Our
mission is to help create a world that supports and enhances the lives of those
infected or affected by HIV/AIDS. We have offices in South Bend and Elkhart and
have grown from a staff of one part-time worker in 1989 to 20 educators, health
care providers, counselors and advocates. Today, AIDS Ministries/AIDS Assist
currently serves more than 650 infected and more than 1,600 affected
individuals. We operate a food pantry in each office that serves only the HIV/
AIDS population.

While much has changed since the founding of AIDS Ministries/AIDS Assist, fear
and prejudice are still common reactions to HIV/AIDS and can have a significant
impact on how an infected individual responds to the diagnosis and treatment
plan. As long as stigma and discrimination are allowed to continue, prevention
strategies, such as testing for HIV, will continue to be difficult. It is very
hard for many who are diagnosed with HIV/AIDS to disclose their status to family
and friends because the family immediately shuns them, and they may give up even
trying to adhere to their treatment plan. In essence, they give up on life.

AIDS Ministries/AIDS Assist is here to provide support to people and to help
them find ways to manage their lives. For some, that may mean finding a safe
place to live. In 2007, we provided housing for 48 of our clients. For many, it
may mean finding a physician who treats HIV/AIDS. There are very few Michiana
physicians who specialize in HIV/AIDS in our area. As our numbers increase, it
is getting harder to find medical care. Many of the HIV infected come to us with
other issues such as drug, alcohol or spousal abuse. This all impacts the
treatment they will receive.

We believe that prevention is the key to reducing HIV infection and ultimately
defeating AIDS. To that end, we present educational programs to young and old in
our community to try and reach people before they become infected. In 2007, AIDS
Ministries/AIDS Assist provided HIV/AIDS education and testing at 33 sites in
Michiana; we reached more than 7,500 people through these programs. Admittedly,
for many people, the discussion of sexually transmitted diseases can be an
uncomfortable subject. It's not easy discussing the behaviors and circumstances
that could result in HIV/AIDS, but if such a discussion could save a life, isn't
a little discomfort worth it?

Because fear and discrimination are so prevalent, many people will not come into
our building. They fear being seen by someone who might recognize them. Fear
also discourages individuals from coming forward for testing and from seeking
information on how to protect themselves and others. People at risk or already
infected may choose not to access health care/prevention services for fear of
being stigmatized. That is one of the reasons we performed more than 1,300 free
and confidential tests at more than 30 neighborhood sites in 2007.

People, especially our young people, cannot protect themselves if they do not
know the facts about HIV/AIDS. Part of our work is to educate people about how
this disease can be prevented. It is essential to reach young people before they
engage in high-risk behaviors, including drug and alcohol use. They deserve to
be provided with correct information presented in a non-judgmental way.

AIDS Ministries/AIDS Assist exists to help anyone with HIV, whether they are
young or old, rich or poor. Currently, the largest share of our funding comes
from state and federal grants. Those dollars continue to decrease each year. We
have seen a 9 percent increase in new clients since 2006. As the number of
clients we serve increases, AIDS Ministries/AIDS Assist, like many other
organizations, sees our expenses increasing faster than our contributions.
Because of community donations, we are able to provide a comprehensive program
that includes testing, counseling, prevention/education, medical referrals and
food/household items from our pantry at no cost to our clients. In 2007, more
than 650 visits were made to one of our food pantries.

What are the most important needs for AIDS Ministries/AIDS Assist? We are always
looking for additional dollars. Donations from the Michiana community are needed
for essentials such as rent, food, medical care and even gasoline for our van
that transports clients to medical appointments.

AIDS Ministries/AIDS Assist needs community financial support and volunteer
support if it is to continue to provide the education, testing and client
services in the community. For more information, please call (574) 234-2870 or
visit the AIDS Ministries Web site at www.aidsministries.org.

Jonathan Glennie: we should moderate calls for aid

LENGTH: 848 words


Sub-Saharan Africa is poor. If rich countries send it money it will be less poor
and people living in poverty will be better off. It seems perfectly logical,
doesn't it? Moved by persistent poverty in Africa, millions of people have
joined campaigns to persuade their governments to give more aid to Africa. But
it is not that simple.

Our focus on increasing aid is obscuring the far more important things that rich
governments can do to help end poverty in Africa. And while aid often does a lot
of good, when we look at all of aid's impacts, not just the positive side of the
balance sheet, the picture becomes less black and white. And less rosy.

Not even the most optimistic of aid's advocates believe aid is that important
for African development. Yet somehow it always emerges as the campaign of choice
when we want our governments to do something. Far more money flows out of Africa
each year than arrives there in aid, but where are the campaigns to stem illegal
capital flows going through tax havens?

Rich countries need to overhaul the rules on international property rights and
foreign investment. They should act on climate change and invest more in
transferable technology. They should regulate better an arms trade causing
turmoil in Africa, among many other things.

By constantly focusing on aid, we are letting developed country governments off
the hook on these issues, all of which are more important for poverty reduction
and democracy in Africa. Campaigners can muster a limited amount of political
capital. We should not be spending it on aid.

The other reason for moderating our calls for more aid is its ambiguous impact
for the poor in many countries. Aid can do good. Emergency aid is often the only
way to respond to crises, and development aid spent well can be life-saving and
life-changing. Millions of children in Burundi, Malawi and Kenya are going to
school free of charge, helped by aid. Vaccination programmes against diseases
such as diphtheria, tetanus and river blindness are among the most conspicuous
of aid's successes. And infrastructure can be improved. Botswana used aid wisely
to spur growth and poverty reduction (before HIV/Aids struck).

So we should not be pessimistic about the good aid can do - it will always play
a helpful accompanying role. But nor should we be naïve about what is achievable
by scaling it up. We need to be realistic about aid's impacts, not least so that
we don't raise expectations too much. Botswana is an exception in Africa. Good
news stories are only one side of the aid coin.

Official aid to Africa (that is aid given by governments as distinct from
private charity giving) also has negative impacts that, far from helping poor
people, have often meant more poverty, more hunger, worse basic services and
damage to already precarious democratic institutions. Do these negative impacts
outweigh the good done by aid? Some people, including many African campaigners,
believe the answer is often yes.

Why? Donor governments attach strings to their aid. Across Africa, aid-dependent
countries have been pressurised into implementing policies that have weakened
their capacity to reduce poverty and have, ironically, made them even more
reliant on aid. From cashew farmers in Mozambique to cotton workers in Kenya,
key industries have been devastated by these aid conditions. While aid is
helping African children to attend school on the one hand, aid conditions have
weakened African businesses on the other, putting hundreds of thousands of
parents out of work.

Some aspects of aid giving have improved in the last decade. But with a few
exceptions (including, on good days, a rather contradictory UK government),
donors are still using aid to pursue their own strategic interests and are
resisting calls to reform. Should Africans continue to accept a raw deal, or are
there better ways of financing development? Increasingly, analysts are
suggesting that there are.

Aid dependency has also undermined the accountability of the African state to
its citizens. African voters and civil society organisations complain that their
governments, now in their third decade of heavy aid dependence, are not
accountable to them. When governments rely more on aid than taxes, they listen
more to donors than taxpayers.

The effectiveness of Africa's civil institutions has also been affected, with
policymakers growing used to having their ideas rejected by donors. Analysts
talk of a 'policy vacuum' at the heart of the Tanzanian government, describe
Ghana's budget as a 'deceptive mirage', and identify a 'mentality of aid
dependency' in Mali, leading to the loss of the 'habit, capacity, and incentives
to set up and implement their own policies.' This problem could worsen if, as
donors promise, aid as a percentage of recipient government budgets increases
yet further.

A balance has to be struck between filling the financing gap and fostering the
development of mature democratic institutions. That could mean reducing aid in
some cases and focusing on other types of development funding. Aid is complex.
More is not always better.

SYMPOSIUM ON RACE CONSCIOUSNESS AND LEGAL SCHOLARSHIP: SILENCE EQUALS DEATH: THE
RESPONSE TO AIDS WITHIN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR

portrayed as only affecting white, gay males, AIDS disproportionately affected
people of color from the beginning of the epidemic. ...  Our goals were
several-fold: to share our knowledge about AIDS transmission and prevention with
our communities directly; to create greater culturally specific resources and
responsiveness within the organization; and to enlist the participation of
people and organizations in communities of color in AIDS education and
prevention, volunteerism, and the creation of resources for members of our
communities. ... In the early days of the AIDS epidemic, there were many
grassroots efforts to bring attention to the disproportionate impact of the

TEXT:
The title of my discussion is derived from the Act-Up organization's motto,
"Silence Equals Death."  n1 I have been asked to discuss AIDS and the law on
this panel which addresses a range of topics about gender, sexuality, and
popular images (stereotypes) of people of color.  Although the legal issues
continue to evolve, I believe that a substantial body of literature already
exists,  n2 and that you would be better served by my more personal reflections
on this topic.

   In preparing for my remarks today, two events immediately came to mind:
Earvin "Magic" Johnson's recent announcement that he has the AIDS causing virus,
HIV; and a public service and campaign in the Washington, D.C., area some years
ago that was directed toward the African-American community concerning high
blood pressure (hypertension).  The ad campaign said "stress kills." The
American Heart Association found that roughly forty percent of adult
African-American women and men suffer from high blood pressure.  n3 The symptoms
of high blood pressure often build internally and the effects become apparent
once irreparable  [*1076]  damage already has been done.  n4 It is a silent
killer.

   In the midst of the continuing AIDS crisis,  n5 I find a painfully apt
analogy between the silent killer of hypertension and the silent killer of
homophobia  n6 within the larger society and within the African-American
community and other communities of color.  Like hypertension, homophobia is a
silent killer, the manifestations of which surface once irreparable damage has
been done.  In the context of AIDS, homophobia often has compounded the
difficulties of contending with AIDS-related illnesses and has thwarted efforts
to educate the public about transmission and prevention.  n7 The fear and stigma
associated with AIDS and those with the illness has resulted in discrimination
in medical care, housing, employment, and insurance, among other indignities and
[*1077]  injustices.  n8

   I became active in AIDS-related work as a community educator, as an
organizer, and as a pro bono attorney during the early years of the disease.
Concerned about the dearth of information regarding the impact of AIDS in
communities of color, I volunteered at the Massachusetts AIDS Action Committee
(AAC), in Boston, in 1985.  The Massachusetts AAC was among the first grassroots
organizations to respond to the needs of persons with AIDS or HIV infection, to
provide community education on AIDS and AIDS prevention, and to demand
governmental resources.  Similar to other organizations which emerged to respond
to AIDS, AAC largely reflected the needs of the white gay male community who had
been severely impacted by the disease.  n9

   Though widely portrayed as only affecting white, gay males, AIDS
disproportionately affected people of color from the beginning of the epidemic.
n10 It quickly became apparent that the faces of AIDS in America were becoming
the faces of people of color.  n11 Increasingly, African-American, Latino and
Latina-American, and Asian-American men and  [*1078]  women required the
services of AAC, the only organization in Massachusetts offering comprehensive
services and resources to HIV-infected persons and their loved ones.  n12

   Despite the changing demographics of the AIDS epidemic, however, much of the
educational, social service, and other outreach efforts of the AAC remained
white-gay-male-focused.  And, although AIDS volunteers came from various
backgrounds, many persons of color who volunteered in the beginning of the
epidemic came from the gay and lesbian community and recognized the impact of
AIDS on other gays and/or persons of color.  The need for culturally specific
responses to AIDS education and services became more pronounced.  n13

   In 1985, we formed the Multicultural Concerns Committee within the AAC to
address the increasing needs of diverse populations impacted by AIDS.  Our goals
were several-fold: to share our knowledge about AIDS transmission and prevention
with our communities directly; to create greater culturally specific resources
and responsiveness within the organization; and to enlist the participation of
people and organizations in communities of color in AIDS education and
prevention, volunteerism, and the creation of resources for members of our
communities.  n14 I became cochairperson of the Multicultural Concerns
Subcommittee in 1986.

   The stigma of AIDS and the perception of AAC as a white, gay organization
prevailed in communities of color.  Many people of color with AIDS would not
come to AAC for these reasons.  Also, it was not  [*1079]  particularly
accessible, physically or financially, to persons of color who lived outside of
downtown Boston.  Consequently, many people of color suffered from AIDS-related
illnesses without seeking services from AAC, while their communities were not
sufficiently equipped to provide information or services to them.

   In the early days of the AIDS epidemic, there were many grassroots efforts to
bring attention to the disproportionate impact of the disease within communities
of color, despite a considerable lag time due to the failure of the media and
medical institutions to inform society about the incidence of AIDS in these
communities.  In general, the mainstream, predominantly white media's reportage
was silent on the rise of AIDS in African-American and Latino communities.  n15

   Equally, if not more disturbing, however, was the virtual absence of response
to the AIDS crisis by community leaders and institutions.  n16 According to
Norman Nickens:

   Minority communities, and community leaders, have not been immune to
homophobia.  Even in light of the devastating impact of AIDS on minority
communities there remain "prominent Black organizations who will not touch the
subject of AIDS because of its association with the taboo topic of
homosexuality, which is often viewed as some sort of white disease, and
therefore alien to the Black community." The response of minority civil rights
organizations to the AIDS crisis has often been one of silence.  Homophobia
[*1080]  remains an important part of the social construction of AIDS.  n17

   Although we knew that working collaboratively with the AAC was important, we
knew that community leaders and organizations becoming involved in AIDS
education was imperative.  Members of the Multicultural Concerns Committee
sought an audience with almost anyone who would listen to us.  Often, we were
successful; however, very often we were not.  We sometimes pleaded for the
opportunity to speak before community organizations or for the organization to
provide the information themselves.  In a conversation asking for a story on the
impact of AIDS in the community with the editor of the local African-American
newspaper in Boston, I recall being told: "We covered that story last month." We
especially sought the participation of the religious leaders, a traditional
source of leadership within the African-American and Latino communities, and
were repeatedly disappointed by their refusal to address AIDS-related issues
with their congregations.  n18

   Even as our committee did our work -- demanding change within the
organization, demanding change within the communities of color, having knowledge
of ever-increasing statistics and seeing the faces attached to those statistics
-- we seldom were able to stop and fully grasp the magnitude of the need within
our communities.  One event was a turning point for me in this regard.

   In the summer of 1987, the Multicultural Concerns Committee sponsored an
event called "Presente." It was a grassroots effort in the sheerest sense of the
word.  We were in the Southend neighborhood of Boston, a predominantly
African-American and Latino part of the city, at the Jorge Hernandez Community
Center.  The program included local  [*1081]  musicians, poets, and political
activists.  The doors to the Center remained open throughout the program and
people walked in -- many, it seemed, directly from the street -- continuously
throughout the program.

   At one point in the evening, we handed everyone a small candle and invited
them to stand and say the name of someone whom they had known who had AIDS or
who had died of AIDS; everyone else in the room would echo the loved one's name
and affirm that they were still with us -- presente. You must understand that
even five years into the epidemic and in spite of tremendous loss, there still
was little open discussion about the disease within communities of color about
who was affected, how they were affected, and what was or was not being done for
them.  The silence caused by the stigma associated with the illness was great.
n19 The implications of this silence on education efforts were obvious; many
people in the African-American and Latino community simply did not believe
themselves at risk for AIDS -- nor did they believe that members of their
communities were being so greatly affected.  There was, and remains, a desperate
need for education and material that speaks directly to the people in
communities of color and that offers them the support systems during a time of
crisis.

   At some point, someone closed the doors, and the hall became a very intimate
place of 200 or so people.  Slowly, one, two, three persons stood to say the
name of their loved ones.  Then another and another stood and said the name of
their loved ones.  The names began to flow with the urgency and force of a
cascade.  Soon, it seemed as though the entire room was standing.  Without
pause, the names continued to ring out in all their moving and melodic force.
People cried freely and embraced.  That evening, I fully appreciated just how
devastated our community had been by AIDS the illness, as well as by AIDS the
silent, suffering shame.  Silence had paralyzed our ability to address each
other and the issues surrounding the illness.

   I was struck by the pain and the relief of people who could not tell friends,
relatives, employers, ministers, or anyone close to them that they or someone
they loved was sick with AIDS.  Saying the name, aloud, in their own
neighborhood, in the company of other caring people of color, was
transformative.  Many people thanked us that evening for providing the safe
space for them to express their grief.

   When I think back to those early days, I realize, too, that the
transformations occurring during that evening represented a microcosm of similar
need, similar silences throughout communities of color regarding  [*1082]  AIDS.
I thought back to the first display of the AIDS Quilt  n20 and the days when it
could be viewed in its entirety.  Now, it is rarely displayed in its entirety
because it is simply too large -- there are too many names.  When I think of the
lives of persons whom I knew and those whom I did not know, now revealed on the
Quilt, I am reminded of the days when many of us tried to educate our
communities to get them involved in AIDS awareness because this silent killer --
this homophobia and neglect for persons of color with AIDS -- deprived them of
much needed love and support.

   The intensity, poignancy, gratification, and difficulty of those days was
rekindled in me as I have tried to absorb the recent news of Magic Johnson's
HIV-status.  n21 An avid basketball fan, I watched his basketball career
throughout my college years while he was at Michigan State and, of course, later
when he went on to the Los Angeles Lakers.  It was always fun to be a Lakers fan
in Boston!  He shocked the world with his announcement, and, like many others, I
felt tremendous sadness upon hearing the news on November 7.

   Magic Johnson's announcement that he has HIV undoubtedly will raise AIDS
awareness to higher levels in communities of color, particularly among the
fastest growing HIV-infected population -- teenagers.  n22 However, the news of
his HIV status has also caused me to reflect on the public response to his
illness, particularly within the African-American community.  Such an outpouring
of sadness and support does not come as a surprise for one so gifted and who has
brought such joy to the community.  [*1083]  And, it must be stated that Magic
Johnson has been remarkably sensitive and giving while grappling with the
seriousness of his personal concerns.  Still, I was disturbed by the lack of
recognition and outpouring of concern for so many who preceded him.

   We have talked a great deal about diversity during this conference.  However,
when we speak about diversity, we must understand that it is more than just an
intellectual exercise.  It is more than a question of "AIDS and the Law." It is
often a question of life or death.

   Angela Harris spoke about intersectionality yesterday.  n23 This theme is
relevant for gay and lesbian people of color who often find it impossible to
live openly within their communities because of the rejection of an integral
part of themselves.  n24 Each one of us must take personal responsibility for
our role in the silencing of others.  The legal issues involving AIDS are
important and warrant continued discussion and activism of persons with AIDS,
attorneys, health providers, and grassroots organizers.

   My purpose in speaking to you today is to call for an end to homophobia in
all communities.  A recent Berkeley Women's Law Journal is a symposium issue
that includes writings by African-American women law professors.  Professor
Angela Gilmore has an article in that volume, in which she states: "The
transformation of silence into language and action is an act of self-revelationa
nd is therefore dangerous; however, the alternative, remaining silent, is more
dangerous, and eventually on some level deadly."  n25

   We cannot live without our lives.  n26

n1  As Professor Angela Gilmore noted, ACT UP's (the AIDS Coalition To Unleash
Power) slogan expresses the notion that the failure to transform silence into
language and action for a cure for AIDS quite literally leads to death.  The
slogan is frequently printed in white, underneath a pink triangle on a black
background.  The pink triangle is the symbol used in Nazi concentration camps to
identify gays.  The emblem declares that "in the time of AIDS the death camps
are not forgotten." Angela D. Gilmore, It Is Better to Speak, 6 BERKELEY WOMEN'S

n3  High blood pressure is a well-known risk factor for both heart disease and
stroke among adults.  A recent study released by the Joint Center for Political
and Economic Studies found that black males under 45 were 10 times more likely
than whites to die from hypertension.  See DIVISION OF HEALTH EXAMINATION
STATISTICS, NATIONAL CENTER FOR HEALTH STATISTICS, A HEALTH ASSESSMENT OF BLACK
AMERICANS (1991).

   The major factors contributing to hypertension include a diet high in sodium,
a history of hypertension in the family, and stress.  "Elevated blood pressure
can be related to changing conditions on the job, such as stress due to shift
changes, extreme work overload or racial tension," according to Dr. George
Rowell, a psychiatrist in Los Angeles.  Pamela Sherrod, Controlling

n5  AIDS -- Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome -- is the name of a series of
illnesses that cause serious illness and death once the body's immune system is
depressed due to otherwise controllable infections.  The AIDS virus may also
affect the central nervous system.  HIV -- Human Immunodeficiency Virus -- is
the virus that causes AIDS.  It is contracted by the exchange of bodily fluids.
Transmission is known to occur by anal and vaginal sexual intercourse; sharing
hypodermic needles for intravenous drug use; pregnancy or childbirth; and blood,
organ, and semen donation.  Casual contact, contact that does not involve an
exchange of body fluids, has not been found to transmit HIV. U.S. CENTERS FOR
DISEASE CONTROL, REVISION OF THE CDC SURVEILLANCE CASE DEFINITION FOR ACQUIRED
IMMUNODEFICIENCY SYNDROME, MMWR (1987).

   This public health crisis continues.  The Centers for Disease Control (CDC)
reported 744 AIDS cases in the United States in 1982; in March 1992, a total of
218,301 AIDS cases were reported.  The CDC's racial and ethnic breakdown shows
that through March 1992, out of a total of 214,609 reported adult AIDS cases,
115,760 were among whites, 61,970 among African-Americans, 34,679 among
Hispanics, 1,346 among Asian/Pacific Islanders, and 343 among American
Indian/Alaska Natives.  For pediatric cases (children younger than 13 years),
out of a total of 3,692 cases, 1,971 were among African-Americans, 903 among
Hispanics, 782 among whites, 19 among Asian/Pacific Islanders, 9 among American
Indian/Alaska Natives.  CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL, HIV/AIDS SURVEILLANCE
REPORT: U.S. CASES REPORTED THROUGH MARCH 1992, at 9 (1992) [hereinafter CDC

n6  George Weinberg coined the term homophobia to define the fear that
heterosexuals felt when physically close to homosexuals.  See generally GEORGE
WEINBERG, SOCIETY AND THE HEALTHY HOMOSEXUAL (1972).  He also used the term to
refer to self-hatred felt by homosexuals.  Today, the term is used to describe
not only the prejudice which stems from the irrational fears and behaviors of
individuals, but also the fears and behaviors of groups, institutions, and whole
societal structures.  MARY JO OSTERMAN, HOMOPHOBIA IS A SOCIAL DISEASE 5 (1987).




n7  AIDS remains incurable; therefore, public education is critical in order to
provide information about the transmission and prevention of HIV so that
individuals can change behaviors which may place themselves and others at risk
for infection.  As attorney Norman Nickens, the AIDS Discrimination
representative of the San Francisco Human Rights Commission, has noted:

   One important obstacle to the development of AIDS prevention and education
programs, in minority and non-minority communities, has been homophobia.  . . .
Homophobia serves to reinforce the false perception that AIDS is a "Gay, White,
male disease." AIDS is not a Gay disease; particularly given the high rates of
heterosexual transmission and pediatric AIDS within minority communities.
Norman Nickens, AIDS, Race and the Law, 12 NOVA L. REV. 1179, 1186-87 (1988).

n9  In the United States, gay men were the largest community to be affected by
AIDS.  However, their health concerns were met with indifference by government
and medical institutions.  Randy Shilts has written, "[T]he story of these first
five years of AIDS in America is a drama of national failure, played out against
the backdrop of needless death." RANDY SHILTS, AND THE BAND PLAYED ON: POLITICS,
PEOPLE AND THE AIDS EPIDEMIC xxii (1987).  Shilts argued that because "it was
homosexuals who were dying," research, funding, media coverage, and public
policy response to AIDS were delayed.  Id. at 95; see also Sullivan & Field,
supra note 2, at 151 n.42.  Groups like AAC stepped into the breach of
government inaction.  See, e.g., AIDS: PUBLIC POLICY DIMENSIONS, PART SIX:
COMMUNITY CARE SERVICES 155 (John Griggs ed., 1987) (discussing the formation of
the New York City Gay Men's Health Crisis and Shanti Project in San Francisco).
New York and San Francisco have the first and second highest incidence of AIDS
in the United States.  "In November 1982, AIDS ACTION started because a few
people couldn't wait for somebody else to help people with AIDS," AAC Executive
Director Larry Kessler wrote in the 1987 Annual Report.  AIDS ACTION COMMITTEE
UPDATE, Apr. 1988, at 3.




n10  In fact, there was widespread, albeit controversial, belief that the AIDS
virus originated in Africa.  Western scientists theorized that the intensity of
the epidemic in Central Africa indicated that the disease started there.  Randy
Hilts, Out of Africa: Dispelling Myths about AIDS, WASH.  POST HEALTH MAGAZINE,
May 24, 1988, at 12, 14.  Similar theories placed the origin of the epidemic in
Haiti.  See FREDERICK P. SIEGAL & MARTA SIEGAL, THE MEDICAL MYSTERY 81-86
(1983).

   Gay men still comprise the largest segment of the U.S. population to have
contracted AIDS; in Africa, AIDS is primarily a heterosexual disease.  Health
officials speculate that the spread of AIDS among heterosexuals in Africa is
aided by a high percentage of untreated sexually transmitted diseases in Central
Africa.  See generally RICHARD CHIRIMUTA & ROSALIND CHIRIMUTA, AIDS, AFRICA AND
RACISM (1988); RICHARD CHIRIMUTA & ROSALIND CHIRIMUTA, AIDS AND THE THIRD WORLD
(1989).




n11  Since as early as 1981, when the first cases of AIDS were recognized by the
U.S. Centers for Disease Control, the percentage of people of color with AIDS
was equal to or greater than their percentage in the population.  Among the
first 108 cases reported by the CDC in August 1981, 73.8% were white, 21.5% were
African-American and Latino.  CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL, 30 MORBIDITY AND
MORTALITY WEEKLY REP. 305, 409 (1981).  African-Americans and Latinos
consistently have comprised between 25% and 14% of AIDS cases, while
constituting approximately 12% and 6% of the U.S. population, respectively.
Disproportionate Number of AIDS Cases in Minorities, CENTERS FOR DISEASE
CONTROL, 35 MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY WEEKLY REPORT ON AIDS 28 (1988).

   It is estimated that more than 70% of women with AIDS are African-American or
Latina.  See Banks III, supra note 2, at 351 n.1; see also ACT UP/NEW YORK WOMEN
& AIDS BOOK GROUP, WOMEN, AIDS AND ACTIVISM (1990).  Pediatric AIDS statistics
are equally grim.




n12  AAC grew to become the primary AIDS social service agency in Massachusetts.
It provided education for high-risk populations, the general public, and health
professionals; a toll-free hot line; a "buddy system"; subsidized housing;
emergency financial housing and food assistance; psychological counseling,
health maintenance education and counseling; referral counseling services for
legal, medical, dental, financial, and insurance help; a speakers' bureau; and
public service and educational material production and distribution.  In some
capacity, AAC served nearly all persons with AIDS in Massachusetts.  Its budget
was approximately $ 3,000,000 in 1987, from a variety of state, local, and
private funding sources.  See CHRISTINE R. ROBINSON, AIDS: EXTENT OF THE
PROBLEM, RESPONSES, NEEDS IN THE GREATER BOSTON AREA 14-15 (1987).




n13  Research indicated that groups in communities of color who were at risk for
HIV infection often did not relate to or understand AIDS educational materials
that were developed primarily by and for the white, gay male community.  In a
survey conducted in Detroit, for example, researchers concluded that:

   the language in the materials describing certain practices and identities
were unfamiliar to blacks surveyed, as were some of the sexual practices
described.  . . . The need to develop written materials suitable for
high-risk-black-homosexual/bisexual-males was designated as a priority.  Our
earlier reluctance to make assumptions about black-homosexual-activity based on
descriptions of white homosexuals seemed justified.
Linda S. Williams, AIDS Risk Reduction: A Community Health Education
Intervention for Minority High Risk Group Members, 13 HEALTH EDUC. Q. 407, 415
(1986).

   Intravenous drug users are the second highest risk group for HIV in the U.S.
population; however, the researchers were unable to locate any materials
directed toward them. Id.; see also Larry Gostin, The Interconnected Epidemics
of Drug Dependency and AIDS, 26 HARV. C.R.-C.L. L. REV. 113, 116, 116 n.11
(1991).

ASSESSMENT OF THE PAST YEAR AND A PLAN OF ACTION FOR THE FUTURE (1987).




n15  See Richard Goldstein, The Hidden Epidemic: AIDS and Race, VILLAGE VOICE,
Mar. 10, 1987, at 1.  When reportage did address people of color, it was often
highly misleading.  In failing to address the overrepresentation of
African-Americans and Latinos in AIDS statistics, the media implied that our
higher risk status was inherently due to race, not due to underlying risk
factors that apply to anyone.  Moreover, the link between race and intravenous
drug use became inextricable, without mention that the majority of
African-American and Latino men who have AIDS are gay or bisexual and not
intravenous drug users.  As Evelynn Hammonds points out:

   In the face of statistics, the New York Times continues to identify i.v. drug
use as the distinguishing mode of transmission among black and Hispanic men, by
focusing not on the percentage of black and Hispanic AIDS cases that are drug
related, but on the percentage of drug related AIDS cases that are black and
Hispanic, which is 94 percent.  This framework, besides blocking information
that the black and Hispanic communities need, also functions to keep the white
community's image "clean."
Evelynn Hammonds, Race, Sex, AIDS: The Construction of "Other", 20 RADICAL AM.
28, 35 (1987).




n16  Hammonds explains the African-American community leaders' refusal to
address AIDS as follows: "Revealing that AIDS is prevalent in the black
community raises the spectre of blacks being associated with two kinds of
deviance: sexually transmitted disease and homosexuality." Hammonds, supra note
15, at 29.  Of course, intravenous drug users must be included as raising a
similar spectre.

   Hammonds continues:

   The leading magazines in the black community, Ebony and Essence carried no
articles on AIDS until the spring of [1985].  The journal of the National
Medical Association, the professional organization of black physicians, carried
a short guest editorial article in late 1986 and to date [1987] has not
published any extensive article on AIDS.  The official magazines of the NAACP
and the National Urban League make no mention of AIDS throughout 1986 nor to
date [1987].  Only the Atlanta-based SCLC (Southern Christian Leadership
Conference) has established an ongoing educational program to address AIDS in
the black community.
Id. at 31.




n17  Nickens, supra note 7, at 1188 & n.33 (quoting from a speech by Gilberto
Gerald, of the National AIDS Network's Minority Project, to the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference, May 31, 1986).  According to Gerald, the
failure of minority civil rights organizations to address the issue of AIDS
results from a number of factors: lack of awareness of the problem, particularly
in light of the media's misleading portrayals; stigmatization of homosexuality
and intravenous drug usage; and the lack of adequate outreach to minority
community leaders by government agencies and AIDS education and service
agencies.  Id.




n18  The previous reluctance of African-American ministers to publicly address
AIDS within the community is indicated by the following expression that appeared
in the Boston Globe: "Although some black ministers described gays as the
children of God and AIDS as just another virus, many more talked about
homosexuality as sinful, including some who referred to AIDS as a God-sent
plague to punish the sexually deviant." BOSTON GLOBE, Aug. 9, 1987, at A1.

   In more recent times, many churches have responded to the needs of their
communities during the AIDS crisis.  Dr. Calvin O. Butts III, of Abyssinian
Baptist Church in Harlem, described his involvement in AIDS awareness as "not
easy." However, after realizing that some people contract AIDS through blood
transfusions or sex with spouses, he adopted a more compassionate outlook.  He
reconsidered his position against clean needle distribution to drug addicts and,
in a sermon during the Harlem Week of Prayer, he advised sexually active gay men
to be monogamous and everyone engaged in sex to use condoms.  E.R. Shipp &
Mireya Navarro, Reluctantly, Black Churches Confront AIDS, N.Y. TIMES, NOV. 18,
1991, at A1, B8.

   Some churches currently support hospices, counseling centers, and day-care
centers for children and adults with AIDS.  In New York, many churches support
Hale House, which provides shelter for infants born with AIDS or drug
addictions, and the Upper Room AIDS Ministry, which serves homeless people with
AIDS.  Id. at B8.




n19  Abandonment by family members and friends was a too familiar response to
persons with AIDS.  Abandonment is a serious problem, and it comes at a time
when the victim, usually young and facing the prospect of death, is undergoing
perhaps the most traumatic period of his or her entire life.  See Thad Martin,
AIDS: Is It a Major Threat to Blacks?, EBONY, Oct. 1985, at 92.  Even those
family and friends who remained supportive to a person with AIDS throughout
their illness, however, also felt the burden of silence and isolation due to the
stigma of the disease and the disfavor of those who had contracted it.




n20  The Names Project Quilt started in San Francisco in 1987, with one cloth
panel to commemorate one person who had died of AIDS.  It is a patchwork
celebration of the lives of those who died, allowing remembrance and grief.  It
is also a symbolic reflection of government and institutional inaction.

   The Quilt was first unfurled at the 1987 National March for Lesbian and Gay
Rights in Washington, D.C.  It contained 1,920 panels, mostly the names of gay
young men.  By 1989, the Quilt contained 11,000 panels, and as the epidemic has
grown and changed, so too the Quilt.  "Every year we sew into the Quilt more
panels for African-Americans, Hispanics, Asians and Native Americans -- more
Quilts made by parents for their children, more Quilts made by children for
their parents." A PROMISE TO REMEMBER: THE NAMES PROJECT BOOK OF LETTERS vii

also E.G. Crichton, Is the Names Quilt Art?, 1 OUTLOOK 6 (1988) ("The Quilt has
succeeded in creating a visual metaphor for the tragedy of AIDS that transcends
individual grieving to communicate beauty and hope.  What more could be expected
of a great work of art?").

n22  The Centers for Disease Control reported that there had been 821 cases of
AIDS among teens through March 1992.  The number of teens who were previously
infected may be much higher, however, as there were nearly 8,600 among those
aged 20 to 24 and 34,000 among those aged 25 to 29.  Because the CDC estimates
the average time between HIV infection and full-blown AIDS is 10 years, it is
likely that most young adults were infected during adolescence. Naomi

 TEXT:
 [*273]

    The Board of Governors of the American Bar Association recognized the
important legal, social, and human consequences of the AIDS epidemic when it
established the AIDS Coordinating Committee in 1987. The mandate of the
Coordinating Committee was two-fold: (1) to investigate and make recommendations
concerning the proper resolution of the legal issues engendered by the AIDS
epidemic, and (2) to coordinate all of the Association's AIDS-related
activities. To accomplish these objectives, the Coordinating Committee was
constituted in a way that ensured a broad and diverse membership, with
representives from 13 different ABA sections, the National Bar Association, and
the New York State Bar Association.

    The Coordinating Committee first met in early 1988. By June 1988, it had
completed work on a 250-page volume entitled AIDS: The Legal Issues,  n1 which
identified and analyzed the issues raised by the AIDS epidemic in 15 different
areas of the law. In August 1988, the Coordinating Committee presented an
all-day educational program, and distributed large numbers of its book, at the
Association's annual meeting in Toronto. In August 1989, the Coordinating
Committee, with co-sponsorship from numerous ABA sections and divisions,
presented a series of 61 policy principles to the Association's House of
Delegates. These policy recommendations, which dealt with 15 different areas of
the law, were adopted by the House of Delegates.  n2  [*274]

    In subsequent years, the AIDS Coordination Project of the ABA Section of
Individual Rights and Responsibilities, with the assistance and cooperation of
the AIDS Coordinating Committee, has conducted numerous educational programs for
lawyers and judges on the legal issues relating to AIDS; it has produced a
nationwide directory of legal resources for persons affected by HIV and AIDS;
n3 it has produced a 30-minute video aimed at educating lawyers about HIV and
encouraging them to undertake the pro bono representation of persons affected by
HIV and AIDS;  n4 it has created an organizational and training manual for pro
bono AIDS volunteer programs;  n5 and it has worked with organizations such as
the Centers for Disease Control, the National Judicial College, and the National
Coalition Against AIDS, in efforts to disseminate balanced, accurate, and
unbiased information about HIV and the legal issues concerning HIV to members of
the judiciary, the bar, and the public.

    The paper which follows, The AIDS Epidemic and Health Care Reform,  n6 is
the latest manifestation of the Coordinating Committee's and Project's efforts
to provide some perspective on the legal and public policy issues raised by the
AIDS epidemic. From the outset, the Coordinating Committee has sought to
influence developments in the law, public opinion, and government policy by
providing an informed and dispassionate view of the relevant facts and legal
principles, and by encouraging persons of good will to act accordingly. That
also is the purpose of The AIDS Epidemic and Health Care Reform.

    When the Coordinating Committee commenced its work in early 1988, the AIDS
epidemic in this country was still largely perceived to be an epidemic whose
consequences were principally being felt among male homosexuals and certain
discrete minority groups such as Haitian refugees. Fear of AIDS was strongly
reinforced by homophobia and racism, and it was with those particular forms of
discrimination that virtually all efforts to formulate a reasoned response to
the AIDS epidemic were required to contend. The male homosexual community
devoted substantial resources to fighting AIDS and AIDS discrimination. Many
members of that community pressed for public health and educational efforts,
which have now had some substantial success in slowing the spread of AIDS. Even
[*275]  in the gay community, however, much remains to be done. Many of the
problems which existed at the onset of the AIDS epidemic, including fear and
discrimination, still exist.  n7

    The effects of the AIDS epidemic continue to be felt in the gay community,
and they are being felt with increased force among other groups. The force of
the epidemic has not dissipated, but its social profile has changed somewhat.
Thus, by 1991, the National Commission on AIDS was able to note that African
Americans constituted 12% of the population, but 28% of AIDS cases; Hispanics
constituted 9% of the population, but 16% of AIDS cases; AIDS cases among women
were growing faster than AIDS cases among men, with women then accounting for
10% of all AIDS cases; and approximately 31% of all AIDS cases could be linked,
either directly or indirectly, to intravenous drug use.  n8 Two years later, the
National Commission reported that "HIV transmission though injection drug use
continues to pose a threat of "flash fire' spread of infection among drug users,
through multi-person use of injection equipment, which can be followed by sexual
transmission to their partners."  n9 In addition, non-injecting drug use is a
significant risk behavior for transmission, based on exchanges of sex for drugs
and on the impairment of decisionmaking capabilities.  n10 "Expansion of the
base of the epidemic, in large part through spread among heterosexuals,
continues to gain ground, particularly among communities of color, women and
adolescents."  n11 Among other things, these facts suggest that the care of
women and children will demand the commitment of increasingly greater resources:
"births to infected mothers will result in more HIV-infected infants, and the
death of infected mothers and fathers will result in growing numbers of "AIDS
orphans.' "  n12  [*276]

    The present situation is a great deal more complex than it was (or we
perceived it to be) in early 1988. So too is the pathology of discrimination,
which draws not only upon homophobia and racism, but upon additional reservoirs
of fear, hatred, and indifference. Thus, it is true today, as it was in 1989,
that "the fullest fury of the HIV epidemic has ... been felt by communities
which already are targets of distrust or discrimination."  n13 But the diversity
of those targets has now widened to include additional communities subject to
different forms of distrust and discrimination. The National Commission provided
eloquent testimony to this point in a 1991 report:



   It quickly became clear during the Commission's travels that HIV disease
could not be understood outside the context of racism, homophobia, poverty, and
unemployment - pervasive factors that foster the spread of disease. This web of
associated social ills has been referred to as "a synergy of plagues." Poverty
and unemployment in the inner cities of the United States entail much more than
an inability to pay the bills. In 1991 being poor is a generic risk factor, for
it is associated with increased risks of becoming homeless, dying a violent
death, and suffering and perhaps dying from a multitude of preventable
illnesses. A 1990 study of mortality in New York City's Harlem found that black
men in that community were less likely to reach the age of 65 than were men in
Bangladesh.  n14

    One could readily add other strands to this "web of associated social ills"
- homelessness, hopelessness, aimlessness, ignorance, and despair on the part of
those who are caught in the web; indifference on the part of those who witness
it at a comfortable distance. At all events, these are the conditions with which
the architects of health care reform must be prepared to deal.  n15 These are
the conditions with which our society must be prepared to grapple on many
fronts. In this sense, it is good to remember the words of President Roosevelt:
"The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those
who have much; it is whether we provide  [*277]  enough for those who have too
little."  n16 That is the particular challenge laid down in The AIDS Epidemic
and Health Care Reform.

    In closing, I would like to express my continued thanks to my colleagues on
the Coordinating Committee for their hard work and support, but especially to
William A. Bradford, Jr. and Michele A. Zavos, who worked extensively with the
ABA Task Force on Health Care Reform and are the principal authors of The AIDS
Epidemic and Health Care Reform. I would also like to thank Douglas M. Jarrell,
a student at the University of North Carolina School of Law, and Sheryl R.
Miller, a student at the Columbus School of Law, Catholic University of America,
who contributed greatly to the research and writing of the paper. Finally, I
would like to thank the editors of the John Marshall Law Review for their
thoughtful and public-spirited undertaking, not only in publishing this paper,
but in organizing the symposium in which it appears. In devoting this issue of
the Review to this important subject, the editors cause us to reflect on the
truth of Justice Frankfurter's observation, that "the bar has not enjoyed
prerogatives; it has been entrusted with anxious responsibilities."  n17 Let us
all endeavor to shoulder those responsibilities as best we can.

County releases 5-year plan

BYLINE: Jason Schoonover, Austin Daily Herald, Minn.

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 2006 words


Jan. 09--The county board is taking a new approach in planning for the future.

The board revealed and approved its first five-year Capital Improvement Plan
earlier this week, a list and summary of board projects from 2013 to 2017.

County Coordinator Craig Oscarson described the plan as a tool for the board and
department heads to use as they look to future projects.

To Commissioner Jerry Reinartz, any good business will have a plan for moving
forward.

"It's just good business," he said

Not everything on the list will happen.

"It's just a plan,"Reinartz said.

For example, Commissioner Mike Ankeny said commissioners told the fair board to
think big, knowing that all their requests may not be met.

One signifiant project highlighted on the list is the replacement of the Oakland
Place Southeast bridge over Dobbins Creek just downstream of East Side Lake in
2014, a project estimated to cost about $2.2 million. Commissioners acknowledged
that's a highly traveled road and could be significant for motorists.

One proposed project is a new, $750,000 four-season building at the Mower County
Fairgrounds that would be built in 2017. However, county leaders said the
proposal is far from a sure thing, and won't be discussed for a few years.

County road and bridge project proposals, 2014-2017:

Note: All plans, costs and details listed are just plans and are subject to
change.

Crucial to make our aid effective

BYLINE: SIMON FEENY

SECTION: A; Pg. 21

LENGTH: 685  words


In efforts to reach the Millennium Development Goals by 2015, foreign aid is at
record levels and the aid budgets of some countries are still increasing
dramatically. Despite making the largest spending cuts since World War II, the
British Government recently ring-fenced its foreign-aid budget. It also
committed to increase its assistance to a level where it accounts for 0.7 per
cent of gross national income by 2013.

Australia has doubled its aid spending since 2005 and will double it again by
2015 when it will account for 0.5 per cent of GNI. By 2015 the aid budget is
expected to exceed $8billion and will be one of the most important areas of
government spending.

There is strong public support for the Australian aid program now, but
accompanying these increases will be increasing scrutiny into its effectiveness.
As the international community increase foreign aid, it is crucial that the new
levels of assistance are used effectively to reduce poverty in developing
countries and also to maintain public support and achieve real progress towards
the development goals.

Foreign Affairs Minister Kevin Rudd has just announced a review to look at the
effectiveness of the Australian aid program with concerns about AusAID's
capacity to manage its increasing budget.

The announcement follows a report earlier this year from the Australian National
Audit Office which concluded that the organisation faces considerable management
challenges amid ongoing program growth.

An even more pertinent issue is whether some recipient countries can put the
additional aid funds to good use due to a problem of absorptive capacity. While
there is now plenty of evidence that aid works, there is also evidence of
diminishing returns after a certain level the positive impacts of aid start to
tail off.

Low levels of human capital and infrastructure can limit the ability of
recipient countries to absorb additional aid, but so does the way in which
donors deliver their aid.

Developing countries are usually recipients of aid from a large number of donors
and must meet a broad range of reporting requirements and host numerous missions
from international aid agencies. This administrative burden will become larger
as the number of donors and their aid projects increase.

The existence of absorptive capacity constraints should not, however, be used as
a reason to discontinue the scaling up of aid.

Recent research shows that aid flows can be increased dramatically without the
problem of absorptive capacity reducing its effectiveness if donors allocate aid
across countries in an appropriate manner.

As donors increase their aid they must carefully consider the geographic
allocation of their assistance.

Some of our Pacific neighbours already receive some of the highest foreign aid
in the world relative to the size of their economies and populations. A stronger
developmental case can be made for directing additional aid to other countries.
Indications are that this is starting to happen.

At the recent United Nations summit Rudd committed Australia to providing at
least 0.15 per cent of GNI in aid to the least developed countries. This will
involve a shift in the geographic focus of the aid program, most likely towards
sub-Saharan Africa.

To maximise the impact of Australian aid there, it should be provided through
existing donors and agencies to reduce its administrative burden.

Further, policies other than reducing the level of aid can be adopted in
countries in which absorptive capacity constraints are believed to be binding.
Donors should use their aid to ensure that existing constraints are relieved
improving levels of human capital, physical infrastructure and levels of
governance.

Donors can also use different aid methods. For example, where capacity
constraints in the public sector exist, aid can be provided through
non-government organisations and the private sector. Such policies will ensure
aid continues to be effective even if all donors reach the commitment to
providing 0.7per cent of their GNI in foreign aid.

Few seek Aids benefits from medical schemes

Few seek Aids benefits from medical schemes

CLAIRE KEETON



ONLY a fraction of medical aid members who are HIV-positive in South Africa - an
estimated one in 14 members - are making use of HIV/Aids benefits even though
they are covered by the premiums they pay.

By last year, about 22 500 members had enrolled for HIV/Aids programmes out of
an estimated 450 000 infected by the virus.

This figure is based on an estimated 6% HIV prevalence among the country's seven
million medical aid members. An estimated 45 000 members already have full-blown
Aids and should be on antiretroviral drugs.

Members do not pay extra to register for most HIV/Aids programmes as the cost is
covered by annual premium increases.

"The schemes are paying," confirms Gary Taylor, the managing director for group
services of the largest medical aid administrator, Medscheme.

Dr Leon Regensberg, the clinical director of Aid for AIDS (Afa), says: "We wish
beneficiaries would join sooner. The benefit they get from treatment is much
greater if they start at the appropriate time, rather than when they are already
sick."

Afa, the biggest HIV/Aids management programme in South Africa, controls HIV/
Aids medical care for more than 36 medical schemes and several companies.

About two-thirds of the 20 000 people registered with Afa are now on
antiretroviral treatment.

In South Africa roughly 90% of medical aids offer some form of antiretroviral
therapy and these options are set to expand when this treatment becomes
available in the public health care sector.

Denial, fear of discrimination, inadequate information, and cost are reasons for
the slow uptake uncovered in a study by the Centre for Actuarial Research (Care)
at the University of Cape Town.

The detailed study into "The cover provided for HIV/Aids benefits in medical
schemes in 2002" reported that only 0.3% of medical aid beneficiaries were
making use of the HIV/Aids programmes.

"People are afraid their confidentiality will not be protected," said Care
researcher, Leigh Johnson.

They are scared that their employers will find out their status if they register
for HIV/Aids programmes, despite strict regulations protecting their
confidentiality.

The cost of antiretrovirals is another concern, as some schemes balance
antiretroviral therapy against other treatment, and members could run out of
benefits.

Weather gotcha down?

One of the nice things about art museums -- other than the art -- is that
they're always temperature and humidity controlled, which makes them wonderful
places to visit when the thermometer starts to register those summer heats. Take
advantage of this and visit a museum. Bring the family, too, especially if you
want to head out of town.

The Dallas Museum of Art has an exhibit depicting the exotic fields of Algeria,
including 15 rarely seen works by Pierre-Auguste Renoir along with 16 albumen
photographic prints of Algeria as it looked in the late 19th century. This
exhibition, Renoir and Algeria, presents late 19th century Algeria as seen
through the eyes of the French painter.

In addition, on view will be 40 additional works by Renoir from the museum's
permanent collection of paintings and drawings, and works on loan from private
collections and other museums. The Dallas exhibition will expand the special
focus on Renoir's Orientalist period to a wider survey of his career.

In conjunction with this exhibit, which will be on view through Aug. 31, Yale
University Press has produced a fully illustrated, 176-page catalog. An
Impressionist Evening is planned at the Dallas Museum of Art from 5 until 8 p.m.
Aug. 22, featuring family activities, films, music, artists sketching and
twilight tours in the Museum's Sculpture Garden.

The museum is closed on Mondays but is open the other days from 11 a.m. until 5
p.m. On Thursdays, the museum stays open until 9 p.m.

AIDS funding to get a boost Money targeted to aid the developing world

BYLINE: Susan Page

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 11A

LENGTH: 505 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON


WASHINGTON -- President Clinton will announce today increased
funding in research for an AIDS vaccine and other steps designed
to address the epidemic of AIDS/HIV around the globe -- including
help for some of the millions of children the disease has orphaned.

In a speech marking World AIDS Day, Clinton will focus on an area
that some AIDS advocates charge the administration has ignored
in the past: curbing the explosion of AIDS in the developing world.

About two-thirds of the 33 million people worldwide who are infected
with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, live in sub-Saharan Africa,
where an estimated 2 million people will die of the disease this
year. That's four times the total for the rest of the world.


Peter Piot, head of the United Nations AIDS program, said Monday
that AIDS in Africa poses a tragedy worse than South Africa's
former apartheid policy or natural tragedies like drought.

"We've made significant medical advances for people in the developed
world with HIV and AIDS," says Daniel Zingale, executive director
of AIDS Action, the largest AIDS advocacy organization in the
United States. "But in the international fight against AIDS generally
. . . we've been virtually absent."

He praised Clinton's announcement as "a good start."

Clinton will unveil:

-- $ 200 million in funding this year for research on AIDS vaccines
at the National Institutes of Health, a 33% increase over last
year. Experts say a vaccine is critical in poor nations where
expensive AIDS treatments are out of reach. Last year, Clinton
set a goal of achieving a vaccine by 2007.

-- $ 164 million for other research into preventing and treating
HIV/

AIDS around the world, a 30% increase over last year. Included
are efforts to curb the transmission of the disease to fetuses
by infected women and to train more foreign scientists.

-- $ 10 million in emergency relief funding by the U.S. Agency
for International Development to help support AIDS orphans around
the world. Experts project that as many as 40 million children
will be orphaned by AIDS by 2010, more than 90% of them in southern
Africa.

-- $ 200 million in funds for a housing program to prevent Americans
with HIV/AIDS from becoming homeless.

Clinton also will dispatch Sandra Thurman, director of the Office
of National AIDS Policy, to lead a delegation to southern Africa
to develop recommendations for addressing the problem of children
who are orphans because their parents died of AIDS.

In the United States, as many as 80,000 children are AIDS orphans.

"We've made a great deal of progress among children with HIV
and AIDS," Zingale says. "But the larger population of children
affected by AIDS through being orphaned is the unspoken problem."

In a "report card" issued by AIDS Action today, a panel of experts
and advocates gives the U.S. government an "A-minus" for research,
a "B" for care and treatment, a "D" for prevention and an
"F" for international efforts.

AIDS-DEATH DROP BYPASSED BLACKS DEATHS IN PHILADELPHIA WERE DOWN 13 PERCENT FOR
AFRICAN AMERICANS, BUT 41 PERCENT FOR WHITES.

BYLINE: Huntly Collins, INQUIRER STAFF WRITER

SECTION: CITY & REGION; Pg. B01

LENGTH: 662 words


AIDS-related deaths in Philadelphia dropped 41 percent for whites last year but
only 13 percent for blacks, according to statistics released yesterday by the
city Health Department.

Among Latinos with AIDS, the number of deaths dropped 35 percent between 1995
and 1996.

Health officials also reported that the overall decline in AIDS-related deaths
last year - 23.5 percent across all groups in the city - varied according to how
people were infected with the AIDS virus.

The number of AIDS-related deaths among men infected by having sex with other
men dropped 41 percent, while AIDS deaths among intravenous drug users declined
9 percent, the department reported.

Among gay men who also inject drugs, the decline was 51 percent.

On the other hand, there was a 9 percent increase in the number of deaths among
people infected by having heterosexual sex, mostly women of color who had
unprotected sex with an infected man, according to health officials.

James McAnaney, chief of AIDS surveillance for the city, released the data
yesterday after a number of minority AIDS groups criticized a Health Department
report last week for failing to provide a racial breakdown of an overall decline
in AIDS deaths from 750 in 1995 to 574 in 1996.

AIDS experts last week hailed the decline, which they said signaled the advent
of improved medicines to attack the AIDS virus.

But the new data show that African Americans and injecting drug users are not
benefiting as much as other groups from the new therapies.

Jeff Moran, spokesman for the Health Department, said the new statistics were
"no surprise." Because of inadequate access to health care and other factors,
blacks also have higher death rates from a variety of other illnesses, such as
heart disease and cancer.

Moran noted, however, that Philadelphia did better than the nation as a whole in
slowing AIDS-related deaths across all groups. Nationally, for instance, AIDS
deaths last year declined 13 percent overall and 2 percent among blacks.

Still, the local statistics brought criticism from several AIDS activists, who
said the city was not targeting enough of its AIDS spending, including $13
million in federal funds, to African Americans, who last year accounted for 71
percent of the newly reported AIDS cases.

"They [city officials] keep doing the same old thing, with predictable results,"
said Gary Bell, executive director of BEBASHI (Blacks Educating Blacks About
Sexual Health Issues), which fights AIDS in the black community. About 90
percent of the agency's $800,000 annual budget comes from the government.

Rebeca Barragan, an offical at the Congreso de Latinos Unidos, which combats
AIDS in the Latino community, applauded the drop in the AIDS-related deaths
among Puerto Ricans and others of Latino descent. She said Latinos were seeking
medical treatment earlier in the course of their disease, allowing them to
benefit from the new AIDS therapies.

The new statistics have added fuel to an already racially charged dispute about
AIDS services in Philadelphia. The controversy turns on whether organizations
headed by white people are effective in combating AIDS in the predominantly
black neighborhoods that are now hardest hit by the AIDS epidemic.

Last month, Jesse Milan, the city's AIDS director, an African American, resigned
following publication of a controversial report that said most of the city's
federal AIDS dollars went to organizations "led by whites." Health officials
have disputed the report, which was written by David Fair, who was the first
AIDS director for the city.

Last week, the leaders of five African American AIDS organizations formed a
coalition to help target more AIDS dollars to the black community.

Guy Weston, a spokesman for the group and head of the Ecumenical Information
AIDS Resource Center, said the city's AIDS service system needs "radical
adjustments" to keep up with the changing course of the epidemic.

AIDS Is Leading Killer of Area Black Men Age 25 to 44

Brooke A. Masters, Washington Post Staff Writer

SECTION: FIRST SECTION; PAGE A1

LENGTH: 959 words


AIDS has surpassed homicide as the leading killer of African American men age 25
to 44 in the Washington area, local health officials said yesterday.

The National Center for Health Statistics issued a separate report last week
showing that AIDS became the top killer of black men and black women nationally
in that age group for the period 1989-91.

Deaths of U.S. residents infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, "are
going up, but so is homicide," said demographer Kate Prager, who worked on the
national report. "Perhaps HIV is growing faster. We haven't stopped shooting
each other."

Homicide remains the leading cause of death for African Americans age 15 to 24,
national health officials said. But AIDS has overtaken homicide as the leading
killer of African Americans 25 to 44.

AIDS "has the potential to devastate our community, and no one is dealing with
it in a comprehensive way," said Mario Cooper, the first African American
chairman of the AIDS Action Council, which lobbies for AIDS funding.

"One of my goals is to encourage black leaders to deal with this. Something
needs to be done to bring the services into the community," Cooper said.

Local officials said AIDS also has replaced cancer as the number one cause of
death for black women age 25 to 44 in Maryland and has become the most common
killer of white men in that age group in the District and Maryland.

In 1991, AIDS was the leading killer of all men age 25 to 44 in the District, as
well as Maryland and eight other states, according to a recent study by Richard
Selik, an epidemiologist for the federal Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. He also found that AIDS appears to have become the leading cause of
death nationally for all men in that age group, based on provisional data from
1992.

Local health officials have been warning about growing numbers of minority AIDS
cases for several years. Much of the increase has occurred among intravenous
drug users and heterosexuals, they said.

"I'm not surprised. These increased numbers are very much apparent in our own
demographics," said Jim Graham, executive director of Whitman-Walker Clinic, the
largest provider of AIDS services in the District. Whitman-Walker recently won a
bitter battle with a group of minority AIDS organizations for a city contract to
provide AIDS services to minorities.

The growing number of African American AIDS patients in the District has
prompted a tug of war between Whitman-Walker and minority AIDS groups for city
contracts to provide AIDS services.

In Fairfax County, "we'll be seeing an increase [in black AIDS cases] for the
next 10 years," said Crystal Groth, supervisor of the county's HIV unit. Black
people account for 23.7 percent of Fairfax AIDS cases, but 46.8 percent of
HIV-infected people who do not yet have AIDS, she said.

On average, people infected with HIV take 10 years to develop full-blown AIDS,
said Victorio Vaz, an epidemiologist for the D.C. Agency for HIV/AIDS. Many
recent AIDS deaths are believed to be among people infected with HIV in the
mid-1980s, when the District experienced a wave of HIV infections among
heterosexuals and intravenous drug users.

Health officials in Maryland, Virginia and the District said local AIDS deaths
reflect, and in some cases have anticipated, the national increase in AIDS
deaths among black men, black women and white men age 25 to 44. So far, AIDS
deaths have not been as prevalent among white women in that age group, they
said.

AIDS was the leading cause of death for black and white men age 25 to 44 in the
District in 1991, and it was the second-leading killer, behind cancer, for black
women of the same age in 1991, according to the CDC study.

In Virginia, AIDS became the leading killer of black men age 25 to 44 in 1992,
according to state health department statistician Neville Rucker. From 1990 to
1992, the number of HIV-caused deaths among black men in that age group rose
from 106 to 166, while the number of homicides rose from 134 to 135. Within that
group, most of the AIDS-related deaths occurred among men age 30 to 39, Rucker
said.

Among black women age 25 to 44 in Virginia, AIDS ranked fourth among causes of
death, but the number of AIDS deaths nearly tripled, from 12 to 35, from 1990 to
1992.

Last year, AIDS became the leading cause of death for black women and white men
aged 25 to 44 in Maryland, replacing cancer and heart disease, respectively. HIV
infections passed homicide as the leading cause of death for Maryland black men
in the same age group in 1990, said Estelle Apelberg, a statistician for the
state health department.

Federal AIDS statistics for Latinos show that AIDS is the second-leading cause
of death for people in this age group, but the report also notes that AIDS
-related deaths for Latinos are believed to be understated by 30 percent. The
leading cause of death for Latinos in that age group is "unintentional
injuries," including car accidents.

The Maryland AIDS administration now spends most of its AIDS prevention and
counseling funds on programs aimed at minority communities, said the director,
Kathleen Edwards. She said the organization now distributes condoms whose
advertising is aimed at African Americans and tries to involve black and Latino
community leaders in efforts against AIDS.

Similarly, the Fairfax health department has given AIDS prevention grants to
African American community organizations, Groth said.

But at this point, health officials said, they see no end in sight to the
increasing AIDS death toll, especially among minorities.

"We are doing a woeful job in terms of prevention," said Whitman-Walker's Graham
"It's true with black males; it's true with black females -- with whites as
well."

TEXT:
 [*239]

    ... Arthur Ashe, Kimberly Bergalis, Ryan White ...

    In the decade since the accidental discovery of AIDS, the HIV-AIDS epidemic
has affected nearly all aspects of life, including virtually every legal
subject. HIV-AIDS has already killed millions worldwide, and will kill many
millions more. The costs of the epidemic - both direct and indirect - in
diversion of resources, in lost productivity, in pain and suffering of those
living and dying with the disease and of their families and friends are beyond
comprehension. And, no cure, not even a vaccine, is on the horizon.

    ... Rock Hudson, Larry Kramer, Rudolph Nureyev ...

    As the old saying goes, "History tends to repeat itself." Undoubtedly this
is because, with the passage of one or more generations to dull memories,
society has not passed on its experiences effectively enough to avoid recreating
the mistakes of the past. Societal responsiveness to disease, including mental
illness, is no exception. Indeed, it is especially illustrative of the point.
Consider, as examples, the unenlightened and counterproductive reactions in this
century to individuals afflicted with leprosy, with tuberculosis, and with
mental disorders. Consider as well how, during this century, our society has
dealt with - or simply ignored - those with physical disabilities. And, abuses
of our physically and mentally challenged citizens continue in many ways.

    ... Cookie Mueller, Bradford Perino, Darlene Winfrey ...

    The AIDS episode is another tragic rerun of history. So many people and
institutions reacted so badly to the news of AIDS. Why did reason, or at least
compassion, not overcome prejudice? People with AIDS, suspected of having AIDS,
and sometimes even suspected of being at heightened risk for AIDS were fired
from their jobs, denied access to public school classrooms, deprived of custody
and visitation with their children, refused services of a variety of  [*240]
kinds, derided and defamed throughout society, and otherwise discriminated
against. Violent physical attacks on people with AIDS including school children,
gays, prisoners, and others were not uncommon. The Ray family home was
intentionally burned to drive them out of their Florida community and to prevent
the AIDS-infected Ray children from attending elementary school there.

    ... Nilda Espinosa, Rosemary McCarthy, Elizabeth Ramos ...

    Unfortunately, the frequent analogy between people with AIDS and modern-day
lepers was fitting. Since the first cases of AIDS identified in the 1980s were
overwhelmingly among gay men, people of color, and intravenous drug users, AIDS
got off to a very bad start. The bigotry of many people, and even of some
religious leaders, found new opportunities in AIDS issues to fight unpopular
groups. Additionally, when the alarming objective medical characteristics of
AIDS (that it is incurable, fatal, and transmissible) were thrown into the mix,
more people were swept up in the hostility toward AIDS and toward those it
infected.

    ... Teresa Havens, Caretha Russell, Ron Sable ...

    In some quarters, AIDS was said to be God's retribution on sinners. In 1993,
the mighty Reverend Billy Graham made big headlines from one of his sermons,
when he suggested that AIDS might be God's curse on people who engaged in sex
outside of marriage. The headlines were much smaller when he recanted days
later. The damage was done. What could Ryan White possibly have done at his
tender age to have warranted the gruesome dying process through which he
suffered? Could any god be that punitive?

    ... Mary Hare, Hector Vargas, Christine Woodhem ...

    For those whose agenda already included unwarranted discrimination and
infringement of civil liberties, AIDS has served as important ammunition. It has
provided a further excuse for some to promote their views of morality for
everyone else and particularly for unpopular groups. Thus, one reason Georgia
prosecutors announced for supporting and enforcing the state sodomy statute was
to help prevent the spread of AIDS. By a five to four vote, the United States
Supreme Court upheld that sodomy law and placed its credibility behind this
neanderthal mentality (although, curiously, after his retirement one of the five
justices changed his mind about the correctness of their decision).

    ... Nancy Accetta, William Robie, Edith Wyrick ...

    Not unexpectedly, the institution of marriage has not escaped the sweep of
the AIDS-morality debate. There have been many proposals for mandatory
premarital HIV-testing, and Illinois and Louisiana enacted and applied such laws
for short periods. Several premarital HIV-testing proposals are currently
pending in various states, although medical care experts roundly view mandatory
HIV-  [*241]  testing statutes as contrary to sound health care goals.
Furthermore, some have strongly objected to the idea of allowing same-sex
marriages, on the assertion that such relationships would encourage the
transmission of HIV. But, the result of same-sex marriages would be just the
opposite, for the promotion of monogamous relationships (whether heterosexual or
homosexual) would help curb the spread of HIV. The history of the institution of
marriage has been blemished by comparable efforts to alienate people and to keep
them in their place on a number of prior occasions. For instance, early in
American history married women were treated almost as mere chattels belonging to
their husbands; slaves were forbidden to marry at all; and people of color were
prohibited from marrying whites. Society has not learned enough lessons from
history. Sadly, for many people, HIV-AIDS had to strike them or at least strike
someone close to them before they displayed concern about the disease and the
individuals with it. Self-interest can be a driving force, but in the case of
this deadly and incurable virus the positive consequences of self-interest
driven concern have simply taken far too long. Why has it taken any thought at
all to appreciate that people suffering with HIV-AIDS are just that, people,
people entitled to privacy and deserving of dignity?

    ... Ova Adams, Lila Emmrict, Nina Johnson ...

    In the last decade, the understanding of HIV-AIDS has changed dramatically
in so many ways - medically, economically, politically, and legally. We now
appreciate that it is not just AIDS (a rapid killer of those who contract the
virus). HIV-AIDS, for most of those infected, constitutes a long-term chronic
condition, possibly fifteen to twenty years in duration. As science finds new
treatment protocols for the symptoms of HIV-AIDS, the life expectancies of those
affected should increase still further. The implications are far-reaching.
People living with HIV-AIDS (PLWAs) will often live with it for a very long
time, suffering from the physical and psychological effects of the disease, as
well as, perhaps, from the unwarranted discrimination associated with it. PLWAs
will be infected and infectious for the remainder of their lives. Hence, the
diagnosis of HIV is at the same time both a life sentence and a death sentence
for the infected individual. It constitutes a sentence of lifelong confinement
to a body playing host to a virus that will work to destroy the immune system.
It constitutes a sentence of certain premature death from AIDS-related
conditions (unless life is shortened by some intervening cause).

    ... Henrietta Adams, Geoffrey Bowers, Mauro Montoya ...

    Some of us wonder about the ethical and moral questions of doctors and
scientists keeping humanbodies alive by treating only the symptoms of this
deadly and incurable virus. Treating symp [*242]  toms most assuredly prolongs
the duration of life. But what about its quality? By keeping people alive
longer, they fall prey to a wider array of opportunistic infections and ailments
which are thereby afforded a chance to invade the body. In the early days of
AIDS, most people died more rapid deaths, usually from pneumosistis carinii
pneumonia alone. Today, the bodies of many people with HIV-AIDS become hosts to
a range of problems (cancers, dementia, herpes, shingles, tuberculosis, and
others illnesses).

    ... J.D. Doherty, Daniel Hanson, Katherine Mickel ...

    It is not surprising to find that the profile of the individual most likely
to commit suicide parallels closely the profiles of many PLWAs. So many PLWAs
undergo a loss of support systems among friends and family; they confront
significant changes including changes of residences and the eventual loss of the
ability to work; and they suffer heavy financial consequences. PLWAs sometimes
endure great physical and emotional pain, including the decline of their
physical appearances (which can constitute a most alarming development). In
other words, PLWAs suffer a loss of that most reassuring factor - control. The
catastrophic loss of control alters ones life dramatically. Life for many PLWAs
becomes a sequence of events done to them, rather than a series of real choices.
Life for them is largely a kind of obstacle course in which their bodies are no
longer user friendly.

    ... Traci Hoskins, Charlie Palomino, Daniel Sotomayer ...

    Suicidal ideations are not uncommon among PLWAs. The suicide rate for PLWAs
is significantly higher than for the general population. Suicide and assisted
suicide provide choices which help preserve some degree of personal autonomy,
personal privacy, and personal control. As Jack Kavorkian continues his campaign
to familiarize people with assisted suicide in his role as "Doctor Death," both
the public and the public's officials should become more comfortable with the
concept. Suicide and assisted suicide can be quite rational choices and should
be legitimized under such circumstances.

    ... Carmen Albanese, Deborah Haynes, Bob Yee ...

    HIV-AIDS goes so far as to cheat the living of our memories of those it has
taken. There is a tendency for our first and strongest recollection of a
deceased family member or friend to be one of our very last times together.
Since HIV-AIDS can be so savage in its effects on many people, our memories tend
to picture the individual struggling with HIV-AIDS to be withered, suffering,
financially strapped, and often hospitalized. HIV-AIDS is more cruel in this
regard than most other diseases because it takes young people at the prime of
life. Thus, the contrast is great between the image of a formerly youthful
vibrant person and the same individual nearing  [*243]  death due to HIV-AIDS.
Those of us who survive and remember must consciously attempt to put the
unpleasant memories behind each time we think about a family member or friend
lost to HIV-AIDS. Indeed, HIV-AIDS might be the cruelest of diseases as it robs
both the dying of their dignity and the living of their memories.

    ... Edward Kalish, Rand Schrader, Susan Zwick ...

    Some people who die from HIV-AIDS related illness are not even permitted to
rest in peace. There have been controversies because morticians and funeral
homes did not want to handle their bodies or their funeral services (which might
be attended by undesirables, like other people with HIV-AIDS). There have been
disputes about what HIV-AIDS related information can, should, or must be
included in death certificates, in obituaries, and on cemetery headstones. There
have been fights with life insurance companies which have refused to pay under
policies allegedly entered into fraudulently by people who knew they were dying
of HIV-AIDS and who did not disclose that fact. There have been battles over
their estates based on alleged incapacity or undue influence brought about in
the context of HIV-AIDS.

    ... Michael Borowski, Rita Gadsden, Daisy Keys ...

    The recent recognition of a drug resistant strain of tuberculosis (TB)
associated with HIV-AIDS may pose especially serious medical and legal
questions. The panic and hysteria about HIV-AIDS has been subject to some degree
of containment because, although HIV is transmissible, it is not really
"contagious" in the sense that the latter term is generally understood. HIV is
not casually transmitted. It is bloodborne, not airborne. However, TB can be a
very different phenomenon. When a TB carrier is in an active or infectious stage
(which can last for a long time and which can recur), the disease may easily be
transmitted through tiny aerosolized droplets from the TB carrier. The
quarantine and abuse of individuals with TB in sanatoria around the United
States occurred recently enough in our history to stand out as a grim reminder
of the terrible human and economic costs of an epidemic of a genuinely
contagious nature. If TB associated with HIV-AIDS becomes more prevalent in
future years, many of the policies of this past decade will be subject to
reconsideration. Furthermore, both HIV-AIDS and the growing TB problem pose
significant complications for the current federal focus on health care reform.
Only time will answer the question of how the enormous costs of HIV-AIDS and TB
will be spread in the economic and political wrangling which will produce health
care "reform."  [*244]

    ... Perry Ellis, Liberace, Paul Stein ...

    The financial realities of HIV-AIDS are, and will continue to be,
staggering. It is an expensive illness - for the research, the hospitalizations,
and the drugs. As we keep PLWAs alive for longer periods, the cost of their care
will rise. Increasingly, taxpayers will be forced to pay the price of this
epidemic as its costs are spread among all of us. For example, many HIV-infected
infants are born to drug-using parents, in impoverished and dysfunctional
families. Those babies are often abandoned to the hospitals where they are born
or to the public welfare system. Most assuredly, one or both of their parents
will die from the effects of HIV-AIDS (if the children survive that long), so
the children may become orphans - invoking the necessity of at least some
governmental involvement. As another illustration, some employers and health
insurers continue their attempts to avoid paying the medical care costs of those
with HIV-AIDS by excluding such coverage from health insurance policies or by
capping the level of HIV-AIDS related benefits. The consequence is, that when
employees with HIV-AIDS can no longer work and can no longer afford the price of
their health care, the public system requires that all of us share the costs -
just as all of us will end up sharing the costs of the natural disasters of
1993-94 (hurricanes, Midwest floods, and California fires and earthquakes).
Further, legislatures persist in legislating about too many facets of the HIV-
AIDS epidemic, and we have even needlessly prosecuted and incarcerated numerous
individuals for allegedly exposing others to HIV. Governments have squandered a
great deal of funds on educational awareness campaigns about HIV-AIDS that
imitate the worthless "just say no to drugs" campaign of Nancy Reagan and
others. This all costs money, a lot of money.

    ... Freddie Mercury, Anthony Perkins, Max Robinson ...

    HIV-AIDS is not the political hot potato that AIDS was in the 1980s, when
President Reagan was afraid to speak the word in public, and when two Republican
administrations attempted to downplay the extent of the problem. Indeed,
adoption of HIV-AIDS legislation, ordinances, and regulations seems to have
become a favorite pastime of federal, state, and local officials who have now
approved thousands of enactments. And, the frenzy of legislation and amendments
will continue unabated. Unfortunately, governmental response to the epidemic has
been deficient in a number of respects and has been soundly criticized by both
the Report of the Presidential Commission on the Human Immunodeficiency Epidemic
in 1988 and the final report of the National Commission on AIDS in 1993. One
political bright spot has been the enactment of the Americans With Disabilities
Act. The 1990s have the potential to be the time in history of greatest support
for challenged Ameri [*245]  cans generally, including those with HIV-AIDS and
those perceived as having HIV-AIDS.

    ... Michael Bennett, Gaetan Dugas, Halston ...

    Though AIDS began as an objective scientific phenomenon, it quickly became
politicized. But a disease ought to remain an objective thing. Yet, more than
any other disease condition in history, HIV-AIDS has been heavily encumbered for
a host of reasons - its gruesome and fatal consequences, its incurable nature,
its tendency to impact unpopular and minority groups, its exorbitant costs, and
its elusiveness. The political maneuvering associated with HIV-AIDS is destined
to thrive. Already in the 1990s, the premiere International Conference on AIDS
scheduled for Boston was abruptly moved to Amsterdam because of an immigration
policy permitting the denial of admission of foreigners with HIV-AIDS. As
another example, in October of 1992 the entire Names Project Quilt was displayed
(for the fifth time) in Washington, D.C., across from the White House. It was
the eve of the Presidential election. The presence of the Quilt, representing
some 20,000 persons who have died of HIV-AIDS, prompted the attendance of
hundreds of thousands of viewers and mourners - and prompted a good deal of
criticism of governmental responsiveness to the epidemic. And, for the fifth
time, no President or representative of his administration was willing even to
venture across the street to officially acknowledge the Quilt. Political gaming
about HIV-AIDS continues. The National Commission on AIDS has been dissolved,
but a National AIDS Policy Coordinator has been moved into the Executive Office
of the President at the White House. What other disease has been symbolized by a
group comparable to ACT-UP, by a quilt acres in size representing its deceased
victims, or by an ornament (the overlapped red ribbon) so politically correct
that it is widely worn by both ordinary people and the elite? How many diseases
arrived to the point that they had their own "awareness" postage stamps? The
politics about HIV-AIDS has been truly extraordinary.

    ... Amanda Blake, Peter Lacher, Robert Reed ...

    As striking as anything about HIV-AIDS has been the changes of focus on all
fronts as we learn more and more about it. Early, it was called GRID (gay
related immune disorder); later, it was AIDS (the rapid killer mentioned
earlier); then, ARC (AIDS-related complex) was recognized but that did not last;
and now the politically proper term is HIV disease or HIV-AIDS (to acknowledge
the full course of the disease and to emphasize its chronic nature). We first
focused on gay men, Haitians, and drug users. However, that created a blind spot
about HIV-infection among other people of color and among other women. Indeed,
women, newborns, and adolescents are now three of the groups with the highest
rates of new in [*246]  fections with HIV, and correspondingly with the greatest
needs for medical, research, legal, and support attention for the future. Today,
there are no longer risk groups, there are risk behaviors.

    ... David Acer, Robert Mapplethorpe, Sylvester ...

    Likewise the legal focus has shifted in virtually every area affected by
HIV-AIDS. The public hysteria about AIDS in the early 1980s led to many blatant
and unwarranted reactions. Many of these most conspicuous abuses are behind us.
We no longer keep children out of school due solely to their HIV-AIDS status,
but infected children's conditions and school attendance should be monitored for
their own protection and for that of their classmates. Now, the attention in
schools is on such issues as whether condoms can be distributed, what will
comprise the content of sex-education and AIDS-education classes, and who should
be entitled to decide those questions. We no longer deprive HIV-infected parents
of custody or visitation with their children solely on account of the
HIV-infection of the parents. Instead, in the family law arena, we must decide
what to do about all of the children who are being impacted by HIV-AIDS (those
orphaned from parents who died of AIDS, those infected as newborns, and those
adolescents who contract HIV due to their experimentation with sex or drugs).
Certainly, while some of the most obvious abuses have diminished, more subtle
discrimination against people with HIV-AIDS and against people perceived to be
at increased risk still exists. The fight against those more subtle tactics will
need to be a primary focus for the future.

    ... Roy Cohn, Richard Failla, Jason Worth ...

    There is still much for the law to do, for the various systems are not fully
assisting and protecting people with HIV-AIDS and those perceived to have HIV-
AIDS. In addition to the problem areas noted earlier, HIV-AIDS educational
programs have failed to curb the spread of the virus. Legislation has failed to
curb the spread of HIV. Nevertheless, legislatures continue to adopt
unnecessarily broad laws criminalizing the conduct of PLWAs, thereby even
further stigmatizing people already burdened with the excess baggage associated
with HIV-AIDS. Many people with HIV-AIDS continue to be ravaged not only by the
disease but also by the system which causes them more physical and emotional
pain and suffering than they should have to face and which drives them into
poverty before they die. We ought to at least promote a system that allows
people to die with dignity.

    ... Vincent Chalk, Timothy Lunsford, Glenn Weaver ...

    As soon as we think we have resolved an issue, other features or angles of
the same issue emerge to challenge the legal system and to create further doubt.
For instance, it was thought that there  [*247]  was no risk, or almost no risk,
of transmission of HIV from health care professional to patient, but then the
case came to light of an HIV-infected Florida dentist who somehow transmitted
HIV to six of his patients. Federal authorities have estimated that more than
125 patients nationwide may have been accidentally infected with HIV during the
course of care by HIV-infected dentists and surgeons. Some surgeons and dental
students with HIV have been prohibited from practicing. Class action suits have
been filed against some health professionals who did not disclose their HIV-AIDS
before treating patients. And, successful "AIDS phobia" suits (for emotional
distress caused by the fear of contracting HIV-AIDS) have been launched by
plaintiffs (who did not get HIV) in several fields, including suits against
medical care professionals.

    ... Sabrina Kripps, Dan Pettinelli, Larry Taulbee ...

    Most health care workers have taken on the war against this disease with
courage and compassion. They have chosen to fight HIV-AIDS and not those people
afflicted with it. But we cannot be as proud of all health professionals. In
some ways, the arrogance of many members of the medical profession has been
divulged in the context of the HIV-AIDS epidemic. Many dentists and surgeons
believe they should not be obliged to know their HIV-status and should not have
to disclose their HIV-infection to the patients on whom they will perform
invasive procedures. Many doctors have opposed early voluntary human trials with
experimental HIV-AIDS drugs and therapies (accompanied of course, by informed
consent). But patients overwhelmingly favor both, and after all it is their
lives that hang in the balance. Why should uninfected patients be denied the
choice of whether to take some degree of risk of contracting HIV? Why should
persons who are dying of HIV-AIDS be denied the choice of treatment with
experimental drugs and therapies?

    ... David Barr, Ethyl Eichelberger, Keith Haring ...

    Indeed, it has been cynically, though appropriately, observed that HIV-AIDS
is a growth industry. In every one of its aspects there has been an expansion of
the individuals and organizations involved with HIV-AIDS - researchers,
caregivers, businesses, volunteers, governments, and so on. This includes a very
real flood of litigation, for thousands of lawsuits involving HIV-AIDS have been
filed.

    ... Megan Nicole, Jeffrey Thacker, Sadie Williamson ...

    The legal profession has responded in several positive ways. Attorneys, law
professors, and law students began to write about HIV-AIDS legal issues; and
volumes and volumes of papers, articles, and books are now available. There is
even a law school casebook on the topic and some thirty to forty law schools
have  [*248]  adopted courses or clinics devoted exclusively to the subject of
HIV-AIDS. Lawyers came forward to provide pro bono services to PLWAs who needed
legal assistance, and a few public interest law firms devoted to HIV-AIDS
matters have been established. Continuing legal education programs for the
practicing bar and judges have been developed. But, much more needs to be done
in every one of these areas in the 1990s. Within the legal profession, many
still harbor prejudices about PLWAs. How fitting was the opening in 1994 of the
successful and telling movie Philadelphia. If ours is truly the noble profession
we so often proclaim it to be, we must lead by example - a better example than
we have been setting. And we will have many opportunities to lead, for HIV-AIDS
will continue to test our Democracy for a long, long time to come.

    ... Michael Callen, Gia, Steven Temmer ...

    The international picture of HIV-AIDS is bleak. While some diseases of the
past attained epidemic proportions, sometimes affecting more than one continent,
HIV-AIDS has been accurately described as the world's first truly global
pandemic. Several countries of Africa have especially been ravaged already by
the disease. Other countries on other continents will follow. HIV-AIDS in the
1990s will continue its trend to disproportionally impact underdeveloped areas
(like Eastern Europe and Central and South America) and people of color. The
newest region showing signs of the terrible scourge of HIV-AIDS and of the
terrible cost of ignoring its presence is Asia. By allowing HIV-AIDS to gain a
sure foothold behind a wall of denial, Asia (where more than half the world's
population resides) will pay even more gravely than it would otherwise have
suffered. It has been predicted that in India alone, soon after the turn of the
century, there will be more than twice the number of people with HIV-AIDS than
there are in the entire world today. Reflecting this geographical movement of
concern, the Tenth International Conference on AIDS will be hosted in Asia for
the first time ever when it is held in Yokohama, Japan, in 1994. However, that
symbolism will not save Asia from the devastating effects of the disease
catastrophe about to engulf it.

    ... Pablo Cruz, Christina Ferdine, Rocky Gagne ...

    The international picture of human rights issues associated with the HIV-
AIDS pandemic is also bleak. Many countries of the world do not hold human
rights concerns in the same high regard as we claim to do in this country. Thus,
the prospects for fair and compassionate care or management of persons with HIV-
AIDS are often dim from the beginning. Conditions which we would not tolerate
prevail in many other places. For instance, there is mandatory HIV-testing;
there are significant travel restrictions for those with HIV-AIDS; there is no
regard for the confidentiality of HIV-AIDS  [*249]  information; there is little
or no medical assistance for those with HIV-AIDS; and there is involuntary
confinement of many people with HIV-AIDS. And importantly, governments provide
very little HIV-AIDS information and education, which people could use to
protect themselves from contracting HIV. Government after government around the
world is consciously allowing its own people to die because other economic and
political interests have priority. It is a disease holocaust.

    ... Tina Chow, Brad Davis, Denholm Elliott ...

    HIV-AIDS will be with us for generations to come. Even if a cure or vaccine
were discovered today, HIV-AIDS will still be with us for decades. A cure for
HIV-AIDS seems almost impossible. Medical science has proved ineffectual in
curing most viral conditions - such as hepatitis and influenza. Discovery of a
vaccine is more likely, but even a vaccine is not likely to be helpful for the
many millions of people throughout the world who already are infected with HIV.
A cure or vaccine would take years to test and approve. Then, there would be the
enormous task of distributing such cure or vaccine to all the people who need it
and want it. Worldwide, that task might never be fully accomplished. After all,
many countries do not have the technology or the money to feed and house their
people, let alone the capabilities to distribute an HIV-AIDS drug to all of the
people. In some parts of the world, armed conflicts would interfere with
distribution efforts. It has been perceptively observed that we will not rid
ourselves of HIV-AIDS in any country unless we do so everywhere, because HIV-
AIDS is as mobile as the people who transmit it to one another.

    ... Narcella Fisher, Fred Lazarus, Ron Mitzel ...

    There is much more ahead of all of us everywhere in the second decade of
this battle. More often than once every minute of every day another human being
dies of HIV-AIDS associated causes, and more often than once every minute of
every day another human being contracts a new infection of HIV. If only the list
of names of those who have died of HIV-AIDS and of those who are living with
HIV-AIDS could be frozen as it is. But the sad truth is that we have only begun
the list. In analogizing between this epidemic and the deaths of millions of
Jews in the Holocaust, social scientist Dennis Altman wrote in his book AIDS in
the Mind of America, "[A] society that tolerates such prejudice is that much
less a good and just society."

New donors shake up humanitarian aid

LENGTH: 837 words

DATELINE: LONDON


LONDON, Jan. 27 -- Emerging powers are gaining influence on the international
humanitarian aid scene, bringing new funds and perspectives.

Here are the top 10 new donors in terms of humanitarian aid reported to the
United Nations between 2006 and 2010, bearing in mind that much of the aid from
emerging donors is not reported. Saudi Arabia's humanitarian aid was $1.247
billion.

In some years Saudi Arabia's reported contributions have outstripped those of
some Western donors.

In 2008, Saudi Arabia gave $500 million in cash to the World Food Programme -
the largest contribution in the WFP's history.

The world's leading oil exporter uses humanitarian aid to exercise its growing
influence, contain regional crises and ease domestic tensions with its large
expatriate population, many from poor disaster-prone countries.

Charitable giving is a key tenet of Islam, which has an obligatory annual
offering of 2.5 per cent of a person's wealth.

The overheads of multilateral agencies are a major concern for Saudi's
faith-based charities. Religious rulings stipulate that administrative costs
should not exceed 18 per cent.

Some Saudi officials have said UN agencies are expensive and slow to distribute
funds.

United Arab Emirates' humanitarian aid was $588.9 million.

The oil-rich Gulf state is establishing itself as an important humanitarian
donor, giving large aid contributions and shaping international policy
discussions on humanitarian aid.

Most of its humanitarian aid goes to Arab and Islamic countries, in line with
its foreign policy. It also gives aid in response to disasters affecting the
home countries of its large expatriate population.

Kuwait's humanitarian aid was $175.7 million.

Russia's humanitarian aid was $137.6 million.

Humanitarian aid has been an integral part of Russian foreign policy since 1993.

Turkey's humanitarian aid was $97.9 million.

Turkey has been warmly welcomed as a new player in the multilateral humanitarian
arena because of its clear commitment to established humanitarian principles and
coordination, researchers say.

Its fast-growing economy straddles Europe and Asia.

China's humanitarian aid was $61.7 million.

China's reported humanitarian aid is probably significantly lower than the
actual figure, partly because its reported figure for aid to its impoverished
neighbour North Korea is improbably low.

The world's second-largest economy gives most of its humanitarian aid
bilaterally to governments and via national Red Cross societies, although it has
increasingly made contributions to multilateral agencies since the 2004 Indian
Ocean tsunami.

China's search and rescue team is among the most advanced in the world, and the
country has experience in handling large-scale disasters internally.

China refers to humanitarian principles as a basis for its approach to giving
aid.

Traditional donors often see Chinese humanitarian aid - especially to African
countries - as part of its often-criticised development policies, researchers
say.

It is one of the largest recipients of the Global Fund.

India's humanitarian aid was $54.7 million

India has recently moved from being a major recipient to one of the most
important non-Western donors of humanitarian aid.

The government refused humanitarian aid in the aftermath of the 2004 Indian
Ocean tsunami, and quickly provided aid to neighbouring affected countries.

India says its main reasons for giving humanitarian aid are to help countries in
distress and to foster friendly relations.

Most of its aid goes to strategically important neighbours.

The South Asian giant has developed a sophisticated disaster management system
and helped countries in the region set up similar systems.

India emphasises countries' sovereignty, giving most of its aid directly to the
affected country's government, and stressing that it should not be linked to
political objectives.

Indian officials have criticised international aid agencies, saying they have
too many expensive Western staff and don't use funds efficiently.

It has channelled some aid multilaterally in recent years, either when the
recipient country asked for this - as Pakistan did after the 2010 floods - or in
conflict zones.

India is one of the Global Fund's largest recipients.

Thailand's humanitarian aid was $39.1 million.

Brazil's humanitarian aid was $34 million.

Brazil has been a donor for decades but recently increased its volume of
humanitarian aid significantly, in parallel with its emergence as a regional
power in Latin America.

Most of its humanitarian aid has been given bilaterally. The 2010 Haiti
earthquake was an exception.

Most of its aid goes to countries in Latin America, the Economic Community of
West African States region and Portuguese-speaking African countries.

In 2010 Brazil joined the Good Humanitarian Donorship group.

Qatar's humanitarian aid was $22 million. Published by HT Syndication with

COMMENT: The aid that failed - II - Jamil Nasir

LENGTH: 1129 words

DATELINE: Pakistan


Pakistan, June 11 -- Donors will give aid to the government as far as a dominant
majority of the people is mired in poverty. This implies that for a corrupt
government or ruler, poor people are an asset

The composition of aid indicates that it has skewed towards security-related aid
especially in the past one decade, implying that it is not the people of
Pakistan who are the direct beneficiaries of US aid. The aid money does not stay
with the people of Pakistan. It is either dissipated in the air as the smoke of
fired bullets or goes back to the US to buy arms, F-16s, missiles and technical
expertise. Hence further vindication of the point that the people of Pakistan
are not an important variable in the determination of US aid, rather it is the
US interests in the region that matter.

Fourth, aid has been transactional in nature. For example, security-related aid
is provided for the specific expenditures made by the army in connection with
the war against terror. According to a report in The Wall Street Journal,
Washington has rejected more than 40 percent of over $ 3.2 billion filed as
claims by Pakistan for the period January 2009 to June 2010, for military gear,
food, water, troops housing and other expenses. The US denial rates have gone up
from 1.6 percent in 2005 to 38 percent in 2008 and 44 percent in 2009, the
report says.

Fifth, there have been problems in the release of aid money. This uncertainty in
release has implications for economic planning based on aid money. Furthermore,
delayed releases reduce the value of money in real terms, as a dollar today in
hand is better than a dollar tomorrow. Sixth, US aid suffers from inadequacy.
Based on the meagre amounts of development and economic aid, it is almost
impossible to initiate any meaningful programme for poverty reduction and
development on a sustained basis.

Besides the motivation and nature of aid, another important question related
with the phenomenon of aid is whether the aid has achieved its avowed
objectives. Has the security-related aid enhanced the security of Pakistan or,
for that matter, of the US? Has economic aid helped in mitigating the economic
woes of Pakistan? The answers to these questions are certainly not in the
affirmative. Pakistan feels more threatened today as compared to one decade ago,
both internally as well as externally. Bomb explosions, suicide bombings and
drone attacks are a direct blow to its security.

As regards the developmental impact of aid, the results are not much different
from other countries that remain reliant on foreign aid. Regarding African
countries where the per capita development aid is much higher than that of
Pakistan, the remarks of Dr Dambisa Moyo, author of Dead Aid are very pertinent
when she says that it is difficult even to mention the name of a single country,
anywhere in the world, that has meaningfully reduced poverty and spurred
significant and sustainable levels of economic growth by relying on aid. On the
other hand, an aid-based strategy hurts more than it helps by encouraging
corruption, creating dependency, fuelling inflation, creating debt burdens and
disenfranchising the people. According to Moyo, open-ended commitments with no
end in sight (as in the case of Pakistan) have failed to deliver.

Insufficiency of aid is another chief reason for its ineffectiveness. The amount
of aid has been so low that it was almost impossible to give a big push to
economic development and growth. The corruption that is often attached with aid
is another cause of its inefficacy. Aid may bring some change in the lives of
the poor if it reaches the poor, which, in turn, means that it should not go to
poor (in governance) governments.

Moreover, aid creates distortions in the incentive system. For example,
development aid is given by donors for poverty reduction. The donors will give
aid to the government as far as a dominant majority of the people is mired in
poverty. This implies that for a corrupt government or ruler, poor people are an
asset. The government, in such a situation, will have little incentive to put in
serious efforts for poverty reduction. In our case, lacklustre efforts at
domestic revenue generation can partly be traced to the distortion created by
aid in the incentive system.

The moral of the story is simple. We should reduce our reliance on aid. Chronic
aid addiction has never solved the problems of poverty reduction and economic
growth. The sooner we wean ourselves off of aid dependency, the better. Even if
we keep on receiving three rupees on a daily basis, it will not bring any
positive change in our lives.

Saying goodbye to US aid does not mean that we should adopt isolationist
policies or attain autarky. It is neither desirable nor possible in this age of
globalisation. The point is that, instead of a transactional and exchange
relationship based on economic aid, both the US and Pakistan need to evolve a
broad-based relationship. Such a relationship should be based on mutual respect,
trust and strict adherence to the sanctity of the sovereignty of Pakistan.
Decreasing our dependence on aid will also provide us with room for more
political choices. Our dependence on US aid better serves the US interests as it
makes arm-twisting easy. Though US legislators are talking about cutting off
aid, US policy makers will never desire that Pakistan walk away, at least in the
near future as about 80 percent of fuel and other goods supplies for NATO troops
transit through Pakistan. Moreover, Pakistan has got a crucial role to play in
the stability of the region. The uneasiness we are currently experiencing in our
relations with the US is merely a war of nerves.

Our strategy should be to gradually reduce our dependence on economic aid, if it
is not immediately possible, and at the same time improve our terms of
engagement with the US. Improving trade relations (through market access to
Pakistani goods) and people-to-people contact may be two important ingredients
of the new terms of engagement. The policy of putting all our eggs in one basket
has never been a good one. Besides developing new terms of engagement with the
US, we need to improve our relations with other countries, especially with our
regional partners, including India. Moreover, we need to put our house in order
by making serious efforts at revenue generation by taxing the rich and the
elite, and tackling corruption and governance issues effectively.

'Dead Aid,' Dead Wrong

BYLINE: Michael Gerson

SECTION: EDITORIAL COPY; Pg. A19

LENGTH: 789 words


The broad American belief that foreign aid is stuffed down tropical rat holes
has been recently reinforced by a young Zambian, Oxford-trained economist named
Dambisa Moyo. Her book, "Dead Aid," has launched her as a conservative
celebrity, feted by Steve Forbes and embraced by the Cato Institute.

And the book is something of a marvel: Seldom have so many sound economic
arguments been employed to justify such disastrously wrongheaded conclusions.

Moyo is on firm ground in criticizing decades of direct foreign assistance to
African governments. Such aid has often propped up corrupt elites, shielded
leaders from the consequences of their own incompetence and delayed reforms
necessary for the development of working markets. She is correct in emphasizing
the decisive role of trade, direct foreign investment and local capital in the
development of poor nations -- sources of opportunity that dwarf aid flows in
size and importance.

I'd go further. Through most of the past several decades, the development of
Africa has not even been the purpose of foreign aid. Europeans often provided
money to elites in former colonies to assuage guilt. During the Cold War,
Americans often used aid to reward loyalty. Most Westerners seemed to view
developing nations as basket cases from which little could be expected anyway.

But Moyo does not take sufficient account of the broad reaction against this
kind of direct aid beginning in the 1990s. The United States started taking a
much more targeted and strategic approach. The Millennium Challenge Account
directed new aid to nations willing to work as responsible partners, dedicated
to reform and transparency. Initiatives on AIDS and malaria required and
achieved measurable outcomes and have often worked through civil society instead
of giving money directly to African governments.

Moyo dismisses these efforts, stating that her book is "not concerned with
emergency and charity-based aid." But America's AIDS and malaria programs are
more than "charity." They herald a new approach to foreign aid -- focused,
centrally directed and results-oriented. The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS
Relief (PEPFAR),  for example, a program I advocated while I worked at the White
House, has helped more than 2 million people get treatment for AIDS. The scale
of the program has also resulted in the strengthening of African supply,
management and human resource systems -- encouraging a professionalism that
bleeds through an entire health system and beyond.

But it is perhaps for the best that Moyo did not write on these issues, because
she knows little about them. Referring to America's AIDS program, she states:
"In 2005, the United States pledged US $15 billion over five years to fight AIDS
(mainly through the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief). . . . But this
had strings attached. Two-thirds of the money had to go to pro-abstinence
programmes." The year of the pledge was 2003. And last year about one-thirteenth
of the program was dedicated to both abstinence and marital faithfulness
programs. It is not a small thing for an economist to be off by a factor of
nine. And it is not a minor thing for Moyo to dismiss and distort the
achievements of a foreign aid program that helped save her homeland of Zambia
from social and economic ruin. In 2004, 7 percent of Zambians who needed AIDS
drugs were receiving them. By September, that figure should exceed 66 percent.
AIDS drugs, admittedly, do not guarantee economic growth. But I suspect that a
generation of hopeless mass death would have undermined Zambia's economic
prospects.

There are other limitations to "Dead Aid" -- its assertion that decimated global
capital markets are a ready alternative to aid for African nations; its naive
attitude toward Chinese engagement in Africa; its strange contention that
African nations might be best served by "a decisive, benevolent dictator."

But Moyo's largest error is an overbroad condemnation of aid itself. "Aid
fosters a military culture." "Aid engenders laziness on the part of the African
policymakers." Surely there is a difference between aid provided to oppressive
kleptocrats and aid given to faith-based organizations distributing AIDS drugs.

If Moyo's point is that some aid can be bad, then it is noncontroversial. If her
point is that all aid is bad, then it is absurd. The productive political agenda
is to increase the good while decreasing the bad. The productive academic debate
is distinguishing between them.

Instead, "Dead Aid" chooses to push the envelope of absurdity, proposing a
"world without aid" on a five-year timetable. Moyo does not detail the possible
outcomes. But we can reliably predict one of them. Many now alive would be dead.

AIDS OFFICE FACING THE AX;
SANTA CLARA COUNTY PLAN AIMS TO SAVE MILLIONS

BYLINE: BARBARA FEDER OSTROV, Mercury News

SECTION: LOCAL; Pg. 1B

LENGTH: 692 words


Santa Clara County is proposing to dismantle a key HIV/AIDS agency to save
money, alarming community workers who fear the move sends the wrong signal to
patients with the disease and could jeopardize millions in federal grants.

The idea was floated in a hastily assembled plan, requested by County Executive
Pete Kutras, to help shave nearly $2.3 million from the public health
department's roughly $90 million annual budget.

The HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Office would cease to exist, and some of its
functions would be incorporated into another agency responsible for
tuberculosis, disease control and HIV/AIDS. HIV community outreach services
would be cut, along with other public health services, such as violence
prevention programs and foreign-language translation of health information.
Twenty workers in the 631-worker public health department would be laid off.

The cuts might not take effect until 2006, and county officials said services to
patients would not be significantly affected. But community AIDS workers seized
on the proposal as a disturbing sign that the county's commitment to HIV/AIDS
may be diminishing.

More than 3,510 county residents have been diagnosed with full-blown AIDSsince
1983, and about 1,525 of them are still living with the disease.

"This has unfolded very quickly. These are very serious and Draconian cuts,"
said the current director of the HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Office, Kevin
Hutchcroft. "In the fourth-largest county in California, to not have a
designated HIV/AIDS office strikes me as just not acceptable."

Bob Sillen, executive director of Santa Clara County's health and hospital
system, which includes the public health department, described the proposal as
"preliminary." Other county services, such as mental health, face even bigger
cuts and consolidations than the AIDS program, he said.

"It's not like, 'Let's pick on AIDS and we'll get a big uproar,' " Sillen said.
"Anything we cut, it's going to get significant community reaction, and
rightfully so. There's no fat left to cut, and there wasn't fat when we made
cuts this past year."

The program offers HIV/AIDS testing, education, treatment and other social
services for patients, using a combination of local, state and federal money.

Hutchcroft's position probably would be eliminated, leaving the county without
"a public face" on AIDS, said Clark Williams, a former county AIDS official who
now consults with community HIV/AIDS service providers. "I think it sends a very
scary message that HIV is no longer a concern," Williams said. "That could be
devastating and result in new infections."

Williams and others who work with AIDS patients voiced their concerns, sometimes
heatedly, at a community meeting with county AIDS officials Thursday.

A spokesman for the federal Health Resources and Services Administration, which
distributes $3.4 million annually in AIDS grants to Santa Clara County, said it
was unlikely that money would be jeopardized by the county's proposed
elimination of the AIDS program.

But community AIDS workers said that because counties must compete with each
other for certain AIDS grants, it's crucial to have an AIDS "czar" who can help
navigate federal bureaucracy and identify money for treatment, testing and
prevention.

San Mateo County's public health department also has restructured its AIDS
services but left an AIDS program director in place, said deputy public health
director John Conley.

IF AIDS OFFICE CLOSES
HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Office may cease to exist under a Santa Clara
County plan. Some functions would be incorporated into another agency
responsible for tuber- culosis, disease control and HIV/AIDS.

WHAT IT DOES: HIV/AIDS testing, education, treatment and other social services
for patients.

Cameras roll as row splits AIDS groups

BYLINE: By MARIANA WAN

SECTION: Sunday Edition; Pg. 5

LENGTH: 575 words


A FRESH row is brewing between Hongkong's two AIDS groups with one accusing the
other of being "grossly" unprofessional and unethical.

Fears have also been expressed that AIDS patients and HIV carriers may be "used"
for self-promotional activities by the territory's richest AIDS group, the
Hongkong AIDS Foundation.

At the centre of the row is a feature film - a foundation project estimated to
cost $ 3 million to make. The professional conduct of the film's executive
producer, and the foundation's education officer, Mike Sinclair, has also been
questioned.

A five-page letter from AIDS Concern chief Lisa Ross to her counterpart in the
foundation, Frederick Tong, is said to have questioned the foundation's
understanding of "its moral and ethical obligations" towards people living with
AIDS or HIV.

"If they really don't understand that, it is about time this is pointed out to
them because they are in the business of providing service to those people,"
said Graham Smith, education group co-ordinator of AIDS Concern.

Copies of what was described as a "strongly worded" letter have been sent to the
Department of Health, foundation board members and AIDS Concern patron Lady
Ford.

Mr Sinclair said it was a case of "paranoia" and professional jealousy on the
part of AIDS Concern.

He denied having mishandled the case, adding he "seriously regretted"
recommending the film's two producers visit AIDS Concern for "background
information" for the film.

The bone of contention with AIDS Concern staff is the way they were approached
for help. Two producers from Media Works went to AIDS Concern to request
meetings with AIDS patients or HIV carriers.

The producers were said to have refused to tell AIDS Concern who was behind the
project, giving rise to suspicion.

"The fact they spent so much time during the meeting talking about promoting the
services of the sponsoring organisation made it sound like a big publicity
stunt," Mr Smith said.

"If you are dealing with an organisation that appears to be more concerned with
self-promotion than with the rights and interests of people living with AIDS and
HIV, of course you will have concern giving up confidential information about
your clients to them.

"Does it sound like paranoia now?"

He said the purpose of the letter was to indicate to the authorities the two
groups had "some very serious problems with our working relationship".

AIDS Concern also has doubts about the objectives of the project as apart from "
AIDS education" and "publicity for the sponsoring organisation", there was "talk
about fund-raising and film awards" at the meeting between the producers and
AIDS Concern.

If the foundation had any respect for AIDS patients they would not be "trying to
utilise these people's experiences to launch a big film which makes AIDS
Foundation look wonderful, raise money and win film awards", he said.

Mr Smith also said he felt "disturbed" AIDS Foundation had released information
concerning the letter before the two groups had a chance to "sit down and work
things out".

Mr Sinclair said AIDS Concern had "grossly over-reacted" and "totally
misinterpreted the situation".

He said access to AIDS patients and HIV carriers was a "very minor part of what
the producers were after", adding nobody's confidentiality had been breached.

There was no intention to use the film as a publicity stunt or to win awards, he
said.

STUDENTS SPEAK OUT: Under What Terms Would you Accept a New Classmate Who Had
AIDS?

SECTION: MARYLAND WEEKLY (MONTGOMERY); PAGE M8

LENGTH: 1747 words


Scientists have determined that Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is
not transmitted through casual contact with a person carrying the AIDS virus,
yet persons who have AIDS are often treated as outcasts. Under what terms would
you be willing to accept a new classmate who had AIDS?

I feel I would try to accept a new classmate who has AIDS the best I could, but
I would always be thinking, in the back of my mind, that this person has a
disease which kills.

Thinking this would most likely make me always want to keep my distance from
this person. This attitude is probably what a lot of AIDS carriers face daily.

There's still an inner fear of AIDS that I have. Let's face it, no one wants to
die of AIDS and there's no cure. NYKEETA PEEL Laurel

The word AIDS has been a dreadful word. Society tends to look down on and never
really display compassion for the helpless victims.

Would I accept an AIDS patient in my classroom? It's a difficult question to
answer. I would tell anyone that they should accept and not discriminate against
an AIDS carrier. But as for me, no.

Scientists are not sure what the future holds and the disease may just take
longer to show up in "casual contact" cases. I feel commiseration for the AIDS
victims who acquired the disease through no fault of their own, but for those
who knew the risks they took, I'm sorry.

I am forced to discriminate for the survival of what the future promises me; the
precious gift of life. KIMBERLY L. BOLLING Largo

Students who have the AIDS virus are the same as any other students, except that
they are facing the death penalty. They feel the same need to be accepted as any
other teenager.

Nobody has AIDS by choice, and it has been scientifically proven that AIDS
cannot be transmitted through casual contact. How many students have anything
but casual contact with the other kids in their school, with the exception of
boyfriends and girlfriends?

There should be no conditions in accepting a student with AIDS in the classroom.
They have the same constitutional right to "Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of
Happiness" as we do. We don't have the right to take that from them because of
unfounded fears. DEB LAUNT Central

It is difficult to predict the terms under which anyone would accept a new
classmate with AIDS. When confronted with the situation, those terms could
change.

Although studies show the disease to be non-communicable through casual contact,
I don't believe I would want the person too near me. A study, after all, is just
a study, and there is always the possibility of error. I value my life too much
to put it at unnecessary risk, even if this risk were the tiniest one.

I also wouldn't want to become close friends with the person, knowing he or she
is going to die, and knowing the blow that death would deal me. Basic courtesy
would be extended on my part, but most likely nothing more.

These terms are only set through my fear of the unknown -- I have never met
anyone with AIDS. But perhaps, when that time comes, I will have more
compassion. Only the real confrontation will tell. ALICE CHANG High Point

The AIDS problem is a major one. However, I have enough basic knowledge of it to
know that you can't get it from sitting across from someone who has it. To get
AIDS you must transmit bodily fluids with someone who has it. This does not take
place in any classrooms that I know of.

AIDS is a safer disease to be around than the plagues of the past, and yet some
people still cry that their rights would be violated by having a sick person in
the same school as they are due to some misbegotten ideas. I wish these people
would stop crying about their rights and look to those of other people. MICHAEL
HADAWAY JR. Friendly

I believe that if people were properly informed of the real dangers and of the
prevention of AIDS, they would allow infected persons to attend school. My
school recently took part in a program which presented the facts about AIDS, and
it made me understand that people should react to AIDS with sympathy and
compassion rather than with fear or hatred.

The AIDS epidemic is not the first disease to have caused societal problems of
misunderstanding. In the Middle Ages, lepers were abandoned to the lives of
hermits, ringing bells and shouting, "Unclean!" to all who came near.

There is a saying that reads, "History repeats itself." I hope our society will
be mature enough to change this and not treat AIDS victims as outcasts, but as
the human beings they really are. STEPHEN YODER Queen Anne

I would not accept a new classmate who was known to have AIDS. I know that this
is wrong. I know what scientists are saying. I also know that I am scared.

I don't hate people who have AIDS, nor do I hate homosexuals, nor do I feel that
people who have AIDS should be outcasts. I do feel, however, that my personal
safety and well-being are more important than having high-minded ideas about
freedom and equality.

People who have AIDS seem to feel that I owe them the right to my schools,
churches, pools, etc. They don't want to take my rights into consideration -- my
right to go about my life without a fear of whom I shake hands with, hug and
kiss.

I don't care what the scientists say. It might be narrow-minded, but I'm scared.
I'm sorry. MARK PIPPINS McNamara

My heart tells me that I should be willing to accept a person with AIDS, but my
brain tells me to avoid a person with such an unpredictable and deadly disease.
I feel that such a person should be able to continue their education if they so
desire.

A reasonable alternative to the classroom would be correspondence school. In
this way, people with AIDS would be able to receive an education without the
threat to others. I feel, however, that many AIDS sufferers would be against
this idea because of the humiliation that comes with segregation.

People with AIDS must come to terms with the fact that they threaten society;
not only physically but mentally. I frankly feel they should take what they can
get. KOFO MARTINS Oxon Hill

If I had a classmate with AIDS, I'd treat him or her like I treat all the other
students. I would walk and talk to them about how they got it, and how they feel
about having it. I wouldn't exclude anybody from having friends just because
they have an incurable disease.

Everybody deserves a chance to live a normal life without having to hide from
people because they're scared of being talked about. Talk is cheap.

If I had AIDS, I would still be having a ball, going to the go-gos, concerts and
movies. Who knows when you'll be going through those pearly gates to meet your
maker? My mother would probably tell me to be careful, but I don't do anything
wrong to ever get a disease, especially an incurable one. JEFF GRAY Tall Oaks

People say that AIDS can't be transmitted through casual contact. If that's the
case, I would accept a student in my school who had AIDS. I believe that all
persons should be able to get some form of education. I don't think that we
should be able to refuse a person who has AIDS into a school.

Look at people who have cancer; it may not be as deadly as AIDS, but it's a
disease and people get it. Cancer victims don't get put out of school.

AIDS victims should be treated the best a human can. If I had a friend who had
the disease, I would treat him/her just like anyone else (I would just be a
little careful with the way we have contact).

I would accept a student who has AIDS in my school. ANDRE' GATLING Potomac

Students with AIDS should not be rejected by our school system. Some of my peers
may disagree with my belief, but that is their right.

I fully understand the ways you can contract AIDS and casual contact is not one
of them. I would befriend my new classmate instead of treating this person like
an outcast. An AIDS sufferer is a human being and should be treated like
everyone else. If I contracted AIDS, I would want people to treat me the same
way.

The only problem that would upset me greatly is their pain. I couldn't stand to
see one of my peers in pain. But even so, I would accept this person for who
they are, because if I didn't that would cause me pain. ZINA ROUNTREE
Surrattsville

I would not accept a new classmate who has AIDS under any terms. AIDS is a new
virus and not much is known about it. Scientists might have determined that AIDS
is not transmitted through casual contact; but are they right?

Twenty years ago, a drug was given to stop morning sickness for pregnant women.
Now the doctors realize that they were wrong in saying it was safe to use.
Millions of people suffer the consequences. The case could be the same with
AIDS.

Even if AIDS is not transmitted through casual contact, what are the limits to
being "casual"? The virus is found in body fluids. It has even been found in
tears.

Personally I do not feel we should take the risk of letting students with AIDS
in school. AIDS patients should be kept out of school. Innocent people should
not have to risk their lives with a fatal disease. KATHLEEN CULLINS Riverdale
Baptist

I don't think it's right to put a student who has AIDS into a class with me. I
am not saying this for my sake, but for the other students and even the student
with AIDS. If a student with AIDS were in my class, he would probably always be
looked down on and teased. I think there would be too much harsh treatment for
the student.

I don't think that other students and their parents should have to worry to the
point where they either remove their own child from the school or inflict
violent acts on the student with AIDS and his family until they leave the
school.

I think the government should try to set up schools that would allow students
with AIDS and other fatal diseases to attend. I know this wouldn't solve the
whole problem, but I think it would be a big step toward settling it. DEVONDA

Shifting Policy, Koch Will Begin New Measures to Deal With AIDS

In a major shift in policy, Mayor Edward I. Koch will announce today new
initiatives for dealing with the AIDS crisis.

The measures include opening the city's first AIDS shelters for homeless people
and making more people in various stages of the illness eligible for AIDS
services. The services are now limited to patients with full-fledged AIDS.

City officials confirmed yesterday that Mr. Koch is issuing the new programs as
part of the budget he will submit to the City Council and Board of Estimate for
the fiscal year starting July 1.

The AIDS initiatives come during difficult financial and political times for the
Koch administration. Smaller revenues have made this budget the tightest in
years, and the Mayor is facing his greatest re-election challenge.

Details of how the Mayor would pay for the programs were not available, but the
city is expected to try to use money from Medicaid programs and those that
provide housing to welfare recipients. Those programs are heavily reimbursed by
the state and Federal governments.

235,000 Cases Estimated

Today's planned announcement also comes amid growing criticism by AIDS
organizations and health-care experts, who have made AIDS policy an issue in the
coming mayoral election. They say that the city, state and Federal governments,
despite spending hundreds of millions of dollars on the epidemic, are failing to
meet current needs and that the existing services are ill-prepared for caseloads
that are projected to grow larger.

The city's Health Department estimates that up to 235,000 people in New York
City are infected with the AIDS virus. It says that about 20,000 cases of
full-fledged AIDS have been reported and that the total will rise to 60,000 by
the end of 1993.

Advocates for AIDS services praised some of the Mayor's plans yesterday,
particularly one that would move away from requiring AIDS sufferers in need of
benefits to fit the Federal Government's eligiblity standard. That standard now
limits benefits to those who suffer from full-fledged AIDS, even though people
with a whole range of AIDS-related disorders can become incapacitated or die
from their afflictions.

''It's motion in the right direction and splendid news,'' said Dr. David Rogers,
who is chairman of both the state's AIDS Advisory Council and the Mayor's Task
Force on AIDS. ''I hope it will prompt the state to move forward with greater
cooperation.''

But many advocates declined to comment on other elements of the Mayor's plans,
saying they were waiting to learn the details. They said they wanted to know,
for example, what services AIDS shelter residents would receive and how many
more people with AIDS-related illneses would be helped. They were also skeptical
that the city can act fast enough to help many people, and they maintained that
far more needs to be done.

Closing the Gaps

Mr. Koch's policies are intended to close some of the more glaring gaps in AIDS
services, involving housing and definitions of who qualifies for services. His
plan include these elements:

* The creation of two shelters, with a total of about 250 beds, for people
suffering from AIDS illnesses.


* The expansion of other housing aid now limited to patients who meet the
Federal AIDS criteria, including rent supplements for patients in danger of
losing their apartments, and the placement of homeless patients in private
apartments and single-room residential hotels.


* The establishment of a four-tier classification to determine eligibility for
other benefits and services for those infected by the AIDS virus.

The proposed shelters for AIDS patients would be the first of their kind in the
city. No sites have been selected. The only local AIDS residence is Bailey House
in Greenwich Village, where 44 people are housed. It is operated by the AIDS
Resource Center, a private agency, with public money and donations.

Part of the overcrowding in New York's hospitals results from AIDS patients'
being left there because they have no homes, even though they are ready for
discharge. Regulations forbid their being sent to municipal shelters, where they
may be exposed to contagious diseases. Over-extended hospital stays also waste
money; hospital care costs up to $800 a day.

The new four-tier system for determining eligibility for services would set
criteria based on a person's functional health status. The city would no longer
simply rely on distinctions drawn by the Federal Centers for Disease Control
between its definition of full-fledged acquired immune deficiency syndrome and
other illnesses caused by the AIDS virus.

Critics of the strict definition of AIDS say it ignores the fact that some AIDS
patients are functionally normal, while others may be seriously sick and even
die from illnesses that are caused by the AIDS virus but that do not meet the
Federal definition.

'Not Far From a Leper Colony'

Among AIDS and housing experts were these reactions:

Kenneth Wampler, who runs a service for the AIDS Resource Center that places
people with AIDS in 20 scattered apartments, said large AIDS shelters ''can't be
allowed to happen.''

''If we've come to the point where we're segregating by disease, it's not far
from a leper colony mentally,'' he said.

Charles Wallrich, the former AIDS coordinator for the city's Human Resources
Administration and now a consultant, said he feared the new programs would
continue to be understaffed and underfinanced. He also noted that AIDS shelters
would prevent confidentiality, ''so a lot of people who need it will not go
there.''

Douglas H. Lasdon, director of the Legal Action Center for the Homeless, said
''they seem to be taking some positive steps'' in broadening eligibility. But he
said it would be unacceptable if homeless people who are infected with the AIDS
virus but who are not sick were kept in regular shelters, exposed to flu,
pneumonia, tuberculosis and other diseases. Peter P. Smith, head of the
Partnership for the Homeless, has estimated that thousands of AIDS-infected and
sick people are already in the shelter system.

Nan D. Hunter of the American Civil Liberties Union, which joined the Coalition
for the Homeless in challenging the city's AIDS policies in court, said, ''I'm
pleased the city has recognized the current system is inadequate.'' But she
contended that eligibility is not being broadened enough to cover all who need
services.

Ten Reasons Not to Miss This Year's Aid Conference

LENGTH: 903  words

DATELINE: New York


Asia Society has issued the following news release:

We held our first Australasian Aid Conference a year ago. In fact, we called it
a workshop, because we thought it would be a rather small affair. Instead, we
got 50 papers and 250 participants, and we're doing it again this year, from
February 12-13 at Australian National University (ANU) in Canberra, again
co-hosted with The Asia Foundation, and again bringing you the best and latest
research from Australia and the region on aid and international development. If
you haven't registered yet, you're running out of time to click here. We had to
close registrations last year due to capacity constraints, and there's every
chance we will have to do so again this year. Meanwhile, if you're still
wondering whether to go, here are ten reasons why you should.

Tanya Plibersek. Last year we had Julie Bishop foreshadow the Coalition's new
aid policy. This year it will be Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs and Deputy
Opposition Leader Tanya Plibersek's turn to set out whether Labor is going to
oppose the new aid cuts, and more broadly what the Opposition's thinking is on
aid and the Pacific.
    Find out why China is setting up the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.
The most controversial development issue of 2014 was China's establishment of
its own regional bank, and the opposition to that decision from the U.S, Japan,
Australia and Korea. Zhou Qiangwu, director of China's Asia-Pacific Finance and
Development Center is a senior adviser to the Chinese government on the AIIB and
other international development issues. He is in a unique position to provide a
better understanding on China's perspective on the AIIB and will be delivering a
plenary address at the conference.
    Debate whether aid has a future. The conventional wisdom is that it doesn't,
but Robin Davies, Devpolicy's associate director, disagrees. He'll be presenting
his heterodox arguments at a conference plenary.
    And discover the future beyond aid. Whether or not aid has a future, there's
growing interest in impact investment, which combines profit-seeking investments
that generate financial return and social impact. Our after-dinner speaker,
Kylie Charlton, is co-founder of Unitus Capital, which raises capital for
entrepreneurial businesses benefiting those at the bottom of the economic
pyramid. Be inspired by her stories, and learn more from GRM's Alwyn Chilver on
impact investing and the future beyond, during one of our parallel sessions.
    Listen to those who receive aid. As Roger Riddell reminded us at last year's
aid conference, too often aid debates and analysis are dominated by residents of
the countries that give aid. This year The Asia Foundation is bringing us a
special plenary session with senior developing country officials responsible for
aid management on the changing aid landscape. We'll also hear from Annalisa
Prizzon from the Overseas Development Institute on her work on this subject, and
about a special survey that Devpolicy has carried out among developing country
aid officials.
    Get the lowdown on aid from India. We've been hearing a lot about aid from
China lately, but what about aid from India? It has a long history and is
growing rapidly. In another plenary organised by The Asia Foundation, speakers
will examine India's aid to Afghanistan, explore India's use of export credits,
and compare Indian and Australian aid.
    Learn what we need to do to fix aid for health. Health was the biggest
beneficiary of the global scale-up of aid over the last decade, so how did the
ebola epidemic happen? Barbara McPake, the new Director of Melbourne's Nossal
Institute and formerly Professor of International Health at Queen Margaret
University, will share her thinking with a plenary address on what needs to be
done to fix aid for health.
    Choose from some 20 parallel sessions featuring 63 papers. The conference
will expose you to the latest and best research from Australia and the region on
aid and international development issues. Session topics include: aid and
governance; aid and health; aid to the Pacific; aid from Asia; aid and public
opinion; aid and security; research and universities; aid and the private
sector; aid effectiveness; migration; disasters and climate change; community
development; and contemporary donor issues. Check out the program here.
    Participate in contributed sessions on aid policymaking, the history of
Australian aid, justice reform, and aid and conflict in Asia's frontiers. Most
of the papers presented in the parallel sessions are invited, but you can also
participate in one of our special contributed sessions.
    Network with more than 200 other academics and NGO, private and government
aid practitioners. It's not just the ideas, it's also the contacts. The
conference is a good chance to meet and chat with others with similar interests
and passions. Who knows where it might lead.

Stephen Howes and Jonathan Pryke from the Development Policy Centre, Joel Negin
from The University of Sydney, and Anthea Mulakala, The Asia Foundation's
director for International Development Cooperation, are the co-conveners of the
2015 Australasian Aid Conference. The views and opinions expressed here are
those of the individual authors and not those of The Asia Foundation.

AIDS initiative praised, but worry persists

BYLINE: DAVID WAHLBERG

SOURCE: AJC

SECTION: News; Pg. 8A

LENGTH: 507 words


AIDS advocates praised President Bush's request Tuesday that Congress pass a $15
billion global initiative soon to fight the disease.

But they expressed concern that AIDS in the United States, especially in the
South, is being ignored.

"The global catastrophe is almost unfathomable and must be an important
priority," said Jeff Graham, executive director of the AIDS Survival Project in
Atlanta. "But we need to make sure that we don't deal with it at the expense of
people here at home."

A report by the Southern AIDS Coalition last week showed a heavy AIDS burden in
Georgia and nearby states and inadequate resources to reverse it.

In Tuesday's White House speech, Bush urged lawmakers to adopt the $15 billion
AIDS package for developing countries he announced in January.

A House committee passed a bill this month similar to what Bush wants. The full
House is expected to vote on it this week, with a Senate committee taking it up
next month.

"When we see this kind of preventable suffering, when we see a plague leaving
graves and orphans across a continent, we must act," Bush told an audience
including ambassadors from Africa and the Caribbean, where AIDS has taken its
biggest toll.

About 25 million people have died from AIDS. Another 42 million struggle with
HIV or AIDS, 29 million of them in sub-Saharan Africa, according to the Joint
United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS.

Of the $15 billion, Bush would funnel $14 billion directly to other countries.
The remaining $1 billion would go to the Global Fund to Combat AIDS,
Tuberculosis and Malaria.

Bush wants AIDS prevention education "rooted in the proven abstinence-based
approach," according to the White House. The president has endorsed an "ABC"
plan used in Uganda, with "A" for abstinence, "B" for being faithful and "C" for
condom use when appropriate.

The House committee rejected an amendment saying abstinence and monogamy should
have priority, but the amendment could be reintroduced in the Senate.

Bush's global AIDS effort comes as his administration has proposed an 8 percent
decrease in the main domestic AIDS funding program, though that includes a 25
percent increase in AIDS drug assistance.

The reduced funding could hit hard especially in the South, which has seven of
the states with the 10 highest AIDS rates and faces a swelling epidemic among
African-Americans, women and rural residents, according to the Southern AIDS
Coalition report.

"We want to encourage the president to address the issues in the South, too,"
said Gene Copello, co-chairman of the coalition and director of Florida AIDS
Action in Tampa.

Dr. Melanie Thompson of the AIDS Research Consortium of Atlanta said more money
needs to be spent studying new AIDS drugs because the virus is becoming
resistant to old drugs. Prevention and treatment programs also don't have enough
funds, she said.

"Drugs are more expensive here than overseas, and many people are uninsured,"
Thompson said. "The South has a huge challenge with this."

CLERICS, MAYOR PLAN EVENTS FOR WORLD AIDS DAY;
PROGRAM WILL OFFER TESTING, TIPS ON PREVENTING THE DISEASE

St. Louis Mayor Clarence Harmon, area religious leaders and HIV/AIDS support
groups and organizations are planning a number of events today and Friday to
mark the 13th annual World AIDS Day.

The number of HIV/AIDS cases has reached epidemic proportions in some countries.
Last year, 34.3 million people worldwide were estimated to be living with HIV/
AIDS, and 19 million have died.

In the United States, AIDS - acquired immune deficiency syndrome - has struck
particularly hard among African-Americans. AIDS-related illnesses are the
leading cause of death for African-Americans between the ages of 25 and 44,
according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.

Health officials predict that by 2005, African-Americans will account for 60
percent of the AIDS cases in the United States, according to Erise Williams Jr.,
executive director of Blacks Assisting Blacks Against AIDS. His organization is
holding two events to commemorate World AIDS Day.

Locally, 52 percent of people infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, are
African-Americans. Seventy-five percent of women and 80 percent of teen-agers
with HIV are African-American. Of babies with HIV in the St. Louis area, 70
percent are African-American.

"On average, we are getting sicker and dying quicker from AIDS," Williams said.
"The picture is bleak for African-Americans nationally as well."

One out of 50 African-American men has tested positive for HIV, he said.
African-Americans account for 13 percent of the U.S. population, but they
accounted for 57 percent of new infections of HIV and nearly 50 percent of the
AIDS cases last year, Williams said.

Williams' organization is sponsoring a program between noon and 5 p.m. Friday at
its headquarters at 625 North Euclid Avenue, Suite 320. The group will provide
HIV/AIDS prevention education sessions, display two AIDS Memorial Quilt panels
and offer free HIV OraSure testing and counseling.

Prevention and treatment efforts will be discussed along with the impact of HIV
and AIDS on African-Americans and the importance of community involvement to
reduce the numbers of new infections.

The St. Louis AIDS Interfaith Service Network will hold a World AIDS Day
Interfaith Service on Friday night at the Central Reform Congregation at 5020
Waterman Boulevard.

"This first World AIDS Day of the new millennium is a special opportunity for
the entire regional community to come together," said Philip Deitch, chairman of
the association.

More than 30 religious leaders will participate in the service.

Harmon will present a proclamation to the Metropolitan St. Louis AIDS program
Friday morning at the World AIDS Day event at 634 North Grand Boulevard.

Joan R. Ferguson, community outreach coordinator with Blacks Assisting Blacks
Against AIDS, said it doesn't matter what a person's social status is, "if you
put yourself at risk you will become HIV-infected - period."

"AIDS is killing us. Black people are dying from a totally preventable disease.
No one has to become affected with HIV," Ferguson said.

"We have been in denial. We have taken the position that this is a drug-users
disease, this is a gay person disease, but in reality, this is a everyone
disease and everyone is dying."

Quality of hearing aids has come a long way

BYLINE: HELEN SUSIK

SECTION: SPECIAL SECTION; SENIORITY; CONSUMER FORUM; Pg. 13G

LENGTH: 1027 words



Have you ever asked yourself, "Is a hearing aid right for me?" Although  hearing
aids do not restore normal hearing, they do allow you to hear  conversations
without straining, allow you to adjust your voice to a normal  volume and
increase your enjoyment of common sounds.

Helen Gladwin, a clinical audiologist at Southgate Hearing Clinic in New  Port
Richey, helps answer some questions about selecting the "right" hearing  aid:

Q. Where should I look to find a provider of hearing aids?

A.  Look in the Yellow Pages under "hearing aids" and "audiologists."  (Large
stores such as Sears and Montgomery Ward also have hearing services in  some
stores.) Shop around - the price of the same hearing aid can vary by $ 300  from
one side of town to another.

Q. What do hearing tests for hearing aids cost?

A. When purchasing a hearing aid, the cost may be included in the price of  the
aid or "unbundled" at about $ 50 to $ 200 for the same tests. Be sure to  ask if
there's a separate charge and remember, there's really no such thing as  a
"free" hearing test. Your hearing aid will cost more if testing fees are
included in the retail price.

Q. What kind of hearing aid should I select from the dozens of models
available?

A. Professional advice is needed regarding the design, model and brand of
hearing aid best for you. Cost, which can range from about $ 800 to more than  $
2,000, is certainly a consideration. But keep in mind that AARP recommends
obtaining a second opinion from another dealer about any specific device
recommended.

Q. Does Medicare cover the cost of hearing aids?

A. Neither Medicare nor most insurance policies will pay for hearing aids  nor
the testing that is a part of the purchase. Veterans who have a
service-connected hearing loss are eligible to receive hearing aids through  the
VA. Here in the Tampa Bay region, Sertoma Speech and Hearing Clinics have  a
sliding scale based on financial need. Florida Medicaid provides hearing  aids
for individuals with moderate to severe hearing loss, once every three  years.

Q. Is there additional expense after the initial hearing aid purchase?

A. Hearing-aid batteries must be replaced - anywhere from twice a week to  twice
a year. Costs are about $ 1 per battery. If a hearing aid fails to work  well,
factory repair may be needed - a cost of about $ 100. Hearing aids also  need to
be replaced; their life is four to five years, less if careless  handling or
poor service or corrosion is a problem.

Q. Can I try a hearing aid before I buy it?

A. Florida law requires a 30-day trial period for hearing aids, with  returns
accepted and refund provided to the purchaser. Some hearing aid  dispensers have
added a proviso that return is permitted only if no benefit  has been
demonstrated and they decide on the definition of "benefit." Be  sure to check
this proviso before signing a purchase contract.

Q. What is the difference between a hearing aid dealer and an audiologist?

A. Both test, fit and sell hearing aids, but dealers typically have less  formal
education. About half of the hearing aids in America are sold by  dealers; if
you work with a dealer, get a second opinion from a certified  audiologist with
a master's degree.

Q. Which is more important, the selection of the right hearing care  specialist
or the hearing aid itself?

A. Both are critically important, but the choice of a specialist whom you  trust
and feel comfortable with comes first. This individual will help you  select the
best device for you (not necessarily the most expensive one) and  will teach you
how to use it. Then, the specialist should continue to provide  support, service
and repairs. You want someone with a proven track record who  will be around for
a while.

Q. All hearing aids aren't alike. Are some better than others?

A. Yes. Some hearing aids provide better telephone coupling. Some are  designed
for anti-feedback (whistling) circuits. Some are designed for people  with no
hearing in one ear. Some for people with disease-prone ear canals,  some for
nerve-type hearing losses complicated by intolerance for loud sounds.  Some
hearing aids are selected for range of available power for people whose  hearing
is fluctuating. Some are better for individuals who cannot see to  change
batteries.

Q. I have friends with hearing aids they cannot or will not use. Is the  problem
with hearing aids or the non-user?

A. In general, those dresser-drawer hearing aids belong to people who were
poorly advised, had unacceptable or uncomfortable devices or were unable to
adjust to a physical change. (Such people often have trouble with dentures,
glasses and other prosthetic devices.) No hearing aid can restore hearing
perfectly and all require adjustments before a comfort level can be reached.

Q. How can I get my father to consider getting a hearing aid? He thinks  hearing
aids are too noticeable.

A. Level with him. Point out that his hearing loss is more noticeable than  a
hearing aid. Suggest a complete checkup to rule out medical reasons for the
hearing loss. Consult an otologist (ear specialist) or otolaryngologist (ear,
nose and throat doctor) for further evaluation if necessary. Then, see an
audiologist for a complete hearing evaluation.

Q. Could you please say a word about old and new generation hearing aids?

A. Today's conventional hearing aid has a wide range of settings, is of  better
fidelity and is much smaller than the device of yesteryear. New  generation
digital instruments use computer technology to amplify sound to fit  with an
individual's specific type of hearing loss.

Q. Where can I turn for further information on purchasing hearing aids?

A. Request a reprint of 10-page, 1992 "How to Buy a Hearing Aid" from  Consumer
Reports, $ 1 per copy R-013: Reprints, Consumer Reports, PO Box  1949, Marion,
OH 43305.

BRITISH AID: THE HAND THAT FEEDS ITSELF;
The Pergau dam controversy further stirred the muddy waters of international
aid. Who spends what? Where does the money go? And just who QBY: Tony German

SECTION: THE GUARDIAN FEATURES PAGE; Pg. 14

LENGTH: 1088 words


THE waste of hundreds of millions of pounds on the Pergau dam hydro-electricity
project in Malaysia focuses legal and political attention on the abuse of
British aid in return for lucrative contracts. It also raises important
questions about the purpose and effectiveness of aid in general. Why do we give
it? What is British aid spent on? Who benefits?

Opinion polls show that over 70 per cent of the public support the concept of
aid. They also show that the public wants British aid spent on basic needs -
emergency relief, primary education and health, help growing food and digging
wells. Over the past 20 years, however, aid policy statements have shown that
the balance between helping the poor and helping ourselves has waxed and waned.

In 1975 the emphasis was on "more help for the poorest". Two years later, the
notorious "Aid Trade Provision" (ATP, under which Pergau was financed) allowed
up to 5 per cent of British aid to be used to subsidise exports. 1980 saw an
explicit decision to "give greater weight in the allocation of our aid to
political, industrial and commercial considerations".

Recently, particularly under Overseas Development minister Baroness Chalker, the
pendulum has swung back to poverty reduction as aid's primary purpose. But then
the Prime Minister justifies Pergau purely on the basis of jobs in Britain.

The Government argues that Britain has one of the world's biggest aid programmes
and that UK aid is well focused on the poor.  Critics respond that Britain is
one of the meanest donors and that little help reaches those who need it most.
What are the facts?

At pounds 1.8 billion in 1992, Britain's aid to developing countries was the
world's sixth largest. But as a percentage of our income (GNP) we gave less than
most, coming 15th out of 22 donors. Whether this makes Britain generous or mean
depends on your view of the tale of the widow's mite. What is clear is that
Britain is less generous than it was 15 years ago. Aid to developing countries
has fallen by 14 per cent in real terms since 1978/79 and shrunk as a proportion
of our wealth from 0.51 per cent to 0.31 per cent of GNP.

Compared to other donors, Britain performs well on many tests of aid quality.
Over 80 per cent of our aid goes to low income countries. The share of UK aid to
sub-Saharan Africa is higher than the EC average. One third goes to "least
developed countries", while the average for the OECD (the 21 richest countries
in the world) is one quarter. UK aid to the poorest countries is given as grants
rather than loans and Britain has played a prominent role on debt relief. In
areas such as health, family planning, education and training, the OECD has
acknowledged the strengths of our Overseas Development Administration (ODA).

BUT these positive points do not necessarily mean that Britain has a
poverty-focused aid programme. As a 1993 report published by the charity
ActionAid showed, most aid from governments does not directly benefit the
poorest people. It is shaped primarily by political and commercial
considerations.

It is estimated that aid "tying" now means developing countries pay at least 15
per cent more than the market rate for aid-financed products. Britain's record
on aid tying is poor - 74 per cent of bilateral aid was linked to the purchase
of British goods and services in 1991. The ODA's good intentions founder on the
powerful British commercial lobby, which stands to benefit from the contracts
aid provides. The ATP, in particular, subsidises contracts nominated by the
companies themselves and offers major gains to a handful of corporations in the
energy, engineering and construction sectors.

The importance of UK jobs and exports is not at issue. But promoting these is
the job of the Department of Trade and Industry, not the ODA. Aid, particularly
good aid, is a scarce resource which can improve the quality of life in the
world's poorest communities. Diverting aid to win contracts may be common
practice among donors but, critics argue, that does not make it right.

Estimates vary as to how much UK aid reaches the poorest, but in 1990 the
National Audit Office estimated that less than 20 per cent of UK aid to India
was poverty focused. UNICEF estimates that 9.1 per cent of UK aid goes to basic
needs - a figure almost identical to UN Development Programme estimates of UK
aid to social priority areas. British aid may be better than most, but it is
still heavily skewed towards large projects - dams, power stations and roads -
although the minister recently signalled a shift away from infrastructure.

In spite of Pergau, there is great potential to improve the focus of UK aid on
the poor and for Britain to play a leading role among donors on poverty.
Britain's strengths in emergency relief are making a difference right now in
Bosnia. Britain used its Presidency to push the EC into strengthening its aid
focus on the poor. The ODA is ahead of most donors in attempting to monitor how
much is spent on priorities such as poverty reduction.

The tragedy is that Pergau may undermine both the practical progress it has been
making and public confidence in the aid programme.

This need not happen. Steps can be taken to reassure people that aid is firmly
focused on the needs of the billion people whose poverty degrades us all. The
first could be a reassertion that poverty is British aid's overriding priority.
No one doubts Baroness Chalker's commitment - but the hope must be that the
Foreign Affairs Committee Inquiry into Pergau results in a government statement
that clearly puts poverty reduction above domestic interests. The World Bank has
said poverty reduction is the benchmark against which it wishes to be judged.
Britain should say the same.

Rather than allowing commercial pressures to shape aid in the image of the
products industry wants to export, greater attention needs to be given to
adapting industry to the real needs of poorer groups in developing countries. As
it is, industry is featherbedded by subsidies from the aid budget, which diverts
funds from more pressing needs such as women's literacy classes and child
nutrition programmes.

Donors have realised that poverty, conflict and environmental degradation are
inextricably linked. Pergau represents the high watermark of aid pollution in
Britain - a throwback to an old aid agenda.

Making Aid Work

By Abhijit Vinayak Banerjee

Published April 25, 2007

What have we to show for 50 years of aid-giving by rich to poor countries? Have
they resulted in any discernible improvement in the conditions of the world's
poor or has the money largely gone to waste? Worse still, might aid have
actually harmed these countries, resulting in a worse economic performance, as
some critics have argued? What, if anything, can be done to make aid work
better?

These issues are examined and discussed in these two books, both by well-known
authors who are concerned with the problem of global poverty and have a
considerable knowledge of the subject matter. The books' publication is timely,
given the renewed interest in the subject of aid in recent years. The "Make
Poverty History" campaign, the adoption of the United Nations Millennium
Development Goals and the commitment of world leaders to increase aid levels at
the Gleneagles Summit in 2005 have given a new prominence to the topic.

Both authors are, broadly speaking, aid optimists in that they believe that aid
can play an effective role in reducing world poverty and helping the poorest
countries improve their economic performance. However, both argue that a lot
needs to be done to make aid work better.

The books are very different. Does Foreign Aid Really Work? is a treatise on the
subject, written by an author whose earlier Foreign Aid Reconsidered was
essential reading for any student of development economics two decades ago.
Roger Riddell is one of the world's leading authorities on the subject. He has
taught, written, published and spoken on it for more than 30 years and has
directed one of the leading charities involved in aid-giving. His book contains
everything anyone might want to know about the subject.

Above all, his book sets out what we do and still do not know about the impact
that aid has on the countries that receive it. What emerges from a reading of
the book is the sheer complexity of the topic and the great difficulty of
determining whether or not giving aid has a positive impact.

First, aid is given by a large number of different donors, which includes
governments, multilateral aid institutions and, of increasing importance, a
multitude of different non-governmental organisations. Some of this comes in the
form of aid projects, some in the form of particular programmes and the rest as
technical assistance or capacity building. Second, the data required to assess
aid and measure its impact often do not exist in the required form. Third, there
is the difficulty of agreeing on the aims and purpose of aid and, therefore, the
criteria against which performance should be measured. Fourth, there is the
problem of the appropriate time horizon over which to judge the outcome. Last,
but not least, there is the problem of determining what would have happened if
aid had not been given - the counter-factual problem.

Perhaps not surprisingly, Riddell is sceptical over any bold claims about the
effectiveness of aid one way or the other. Much research has been carried out,
but the results are mixed. Perhaps more valuable than learning what works is
discovering what does not work. This is to be expected as there are so many
factors that affect the outcome of aid given. Therefore, Riddell wants to turn
the question around, asking what can be done to make aid more effective.

Five problems need to be addressed, he argues: the amount of aid given; the
rational and efficient allocation of aid; stable flows of aid; eliminating
overlap, duplication and inconsistency arising from the multitude of different
bodies giving aid; and addressing the imbalance in the donor-recipient
relationship that leaves recipients as the junior partner. Much is already being
done to address some of these issues. What matters is their cumulative impact.

By way of contrast, Making Aid Work is a short book, consisting of a series of
contributions by different academics and practitioners. Like Riddell, the lead
author, Abhijit Vinayak Banerjee, professor of economics at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, is an aid optimist, who thinks that aid can be made to
work.

However, what is needed is an improvement in the method of giving aid. Banerjee
blames "institutional laziness" - aid institutions fail to make the effort to
find out what forms of aid work before they give it. He cites the example of a
recent publication of the World Bank that contained a long list of best-practice
measures for reducing poverty, without providing any evidence that they work.
Research to find out what does work suffers from the difficulty that we cannot
know whether or not what we observe to be taking place is the result of the
measures introduced. Banerjee's solution is to borrow from medical research the
practice of carrying out randomised trials before giving aid and fund only
projects that are proven to work.

He gives the example of randomised evaluations to find the cheapest way of
getting children to spend more time in school. This turned out to be giving
children deworming medicine so that they were sick less often.

Choosing the right option can matter a great deal in ensuring that scarce aid
money is not wasted on expensive, ineffectual projects. As several of the other
contributors show, there are practical problems in carrying this approach too
far. However, Banerjee is surely right to argue for a more scientific approach
to aid giving and the selection of suitable projects for funding.

Here are two books that are essential reading for anyone interested in the
subject of aid and wishing to be informed about the issues involved. At a time
when politicians are being urged to match actions with words by increasing
levels of aid giving, it is vitally important that we stand back and ask how we
can make the funds currently available achieve much better results. Making aid
more effective matters as much as giving more.

QUO VADIS: IS THE ESTABLISHMENT CLAUSE UNDERGOING METAMORPHOSIS?


NAME: Thomas R. McCoy *

BIO:



   * Professor of Law, Vanderbilt Law School.


 TEXT:
 [*547]

   "Where are we going with the Establishment Clause?" This paper argues that we
are not "going" anywhere doctrinally speaking, and argues further that we have
been "here" for much longer than most people think. But the paper concludes with
a suggestion that no existing doctrinal construct, including the one that has
been controlling for many years, is adequate to deal with the phenomenon of
substantial and widespread government aid to religious schools i.e., voucher
programs.


   It is increasingly commonplace in scholarly circles to hear the assertion
that the United States Supreme Court in recent years has been dismantling the
doctrinal "wall of separation" between church and state that was imposed in
classic Establishment Clause cases to prevent government resources (money,
goods, or services) from being used to support religious institutions. This
assertion often is accompanied by a grateful recognition that the modern Court
at least remains alertly on guard against any government symbolic endorsement of
religion. But the tone of these observations usually suggests that the Court's
willingness to strike symbolic government endorsement is small comfort after the
loss of the main battle to prevent real material aid to religion.


   The impression that the Court's modern Establishment Clause jurisprudence is
a radical rejection of the clear mandate of the classic cases results from a
wishful and simplistic mischaracterization of the classic cases. Those classic
cases that struck down instances of government material aid to religious
institutions should never have been understood to impose a prohibition against
all government material aid to religion. n1 First, such a simple absolute ban
was then and is now impossible to implement in the face of pervasive government
involvement in the affairs of daily life, including the life of religious
institutions. It simply is not possible, even if it were thought desirable, for
government to avoid providing religious institutions with  [*548]  substantial
economic benefits that include, for example, water and sewer service, fire and
police protection, and the advantages ofthe corporate form of organization. It
is not an answer to say that these benefits are purely "secular," because the
"no aid" reading of the Establishment Clause would prohibit secular aid where it
frees the religious institution's own resources for reallocation to its
religious activities. n2


   Second, the "no aid" characterization simply is not an accurate description
of the results in the classic cases. Anyone familiar with the classic cases
knows well that some instances of government material aid were struck n3 while
others were sustained. n4 Indeed, it is common to hear the whole line of cases
described as hopelessly confusing and irreconcilably inconsistent. The simple
"no aid" reading of the Establishment Clause is completely unable to explain why
some government aid programs were struck while others were sustained. More
important, the "no aid" reading is unable to explain why some government aid
programs were struck while many other forms of government aid continued to flow
to religious institutions without even giving rise to a constitutional
challenge. And even more perplexing is the fact that many subscribers to the "no
aid" position find no difficulty with the massive government financial aid to
religion by preferential treatment of religion in the tax laws, particularly in
the form of property tax exemptions. n5


   Third, the strict "no aid" reading of the Establishment Clause would require
the exclusion of religious institutions fromgenerally available government aid
programs. But excluding religious recipients from otherwise generally available
aid programs constitutes a "penalty" on the free exercise of religion under the
unconstitutional conditions doctrine. n6 Such a "penalty" on free exercise
violates the spirit of the Free Exercise Clause, even if it no longer violates
the law of the Free Exercise Clause after Employment Division v.  [*549]  Smith.
n7 And such a penalty still violates the law of the First Amendment, even after
Smith, if the religious activity can be recharacterized as "speech" or "press."
n8 In any event, at very best the strict "no aid" reading of the Establishment
Clause is responsible for what is perceived to be irreconcilable "tension"
between the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause. n9 In a less
politically charged area of constitutional interpretation, the discovery of such
"tension" would immediately suggest that there is a defect in the doctrinal
construct responsible for the "tension."


   In short, it is not just the modern Establishment Clause cases that cannot be
understood in terms of or reconciled with the "no aid" reading of the
Establishment Clause attributed to the classic cases. The first thesis of this
paper is that three principles have guided the Establishment Clause
jurisprudence of a majority of Supreme Court Justices for many years and that
these three principles have just begun to emerge with somewhat greater clarity
in recent cases. It is accurate to say that these principles have only begun to
emerge because the majority of Justices, whose decisions long have reflected
these three principles, have not yet actually articulated the three principles
together in any clear and consistent form.


   The three principles that are reflected in and thus "explain" the Supreme
Court's Establishment Clause jurisprudence over the years are:


   Government may not provide material aid (money, goods, or services) to
religion unless such aid is made available to all individuals and institutions
without regard to religion. [Although it has become stylish in some circles to
refer to a broader form of this principle as "the neutrality principle," this
paper will refer to this principle as a narrower "equal aid" principle.]


   Government may not promote or encourage (i.e., "endorse") any form of
religion over any other form or endorse religion over nonreligion. [This will be
referred to hereafter as the "no endorsement" principle.]


   Any deliberate or direct violation of principles 1 and 2 above by the
government will be found to be a per se violation of the Establishment Clause,
while an accidental or inadvertent violation that occurs in pursuit of a
non-religious governmental objective will result in the application of a
balancing  [*550]  test. [Because preferential material aid to religion is never
in fact accidental, this will be referred to hereafter as the "accidental
endorsement" principle.]


   Contrary to popular perception, most cases do not fall neatly into either the
"aid" category addressed by Principle #1 or the "endorsement" category addressed
by Principle #2. A case of visible government material aid to religion often
implicitly communicates to a reasonable observer some sense that the government
approves of or endorses the aided religious activity. Thus, the real key to
understanding the Supreme Court's results in cases of government material aid to
religion is understanding the interplay between Principle #1 and Principle #3.
Unfortunately, this interaction occurs at an intuitive or poorly expressed level
in many cases, leaving a frustrated group of dissenting Justices and an even
more frustrated corps of commentators.


   Principle #1


   The government may not provide material aid (money, goods, or services) to
religion unless such aid is made available to all individuals and institutions
without regard to religion.


   Virtually no one would seriously argue with the validity of the prohibition
on preferential aid contained in this principle. It is the corollary of that
prohibition that evokes disagreement on and off the Court and that is essential
to an understanding of the majority's Establishment Clause jurisprudence:
Government material aid to religion, however visible and substantial, does not
violate Principle #1 as long as the aid is made equally available to all
individuals or institutions without regard to religion. The Court always has had
several members who profess to believe that any government money, or its
equivalent in goods and services, flowing directly to a religious institution is
a per se violation of the Establishment Clause. n10 The citation most often
offered as authority for this view is Jefferson's metaphorical "wall of
separation between church and State." n11 Supporters of this view argue that aid
to religion is "politically divisive." n12 They focus attention on the vocal and
sometimes  [*551]  bitter political opposition to such aid schemes, usually
including the case at hand which was brought by determined opponents of the aid
scheme seeking to enjoin its implementation. Note, then, that this view usually
accounts for three or four votes for a finding that a generally available equal
aid program violates the Establishment Clause when the recipient happens to be
an individual or institution engaged in religious activities.


   There is considerable superficial appeal in the simplicity of the "wall"
metaphor and in the black-and-white notion that any government aid to religion
violates the Establishment Clause per se. But even modest analysis demonstrates
that neither of those absolutist notions is possible or desirable in today's
world. As noted earlier, religious institutions benefit greatly from
government-supplied fire and police protection, water and sewer service, garbage
collection, and even the public roads that serve the institutions. It does not
occur to even the most dedicated proponents of strict separation to challenge
the receipt by religious institutions of such generally available government
benefits. n13


   Indeed, one can argue quite persuasively that withholding otherwise equally
available government "aid" from individuals and institutions engaged in
religious activities would, under the unconstitutional conditions doctrine,
constitute a "penalty" on the exercise of religion in violation of the Free
Exercise Clause. n14 Proponents of the "no aid" approach often avoid this
awkward reality by focusing only on the portion of the program in which the
majority of funds reaches religious schools, while ignoring substantial
preexisting aid to nonreligion which is only partially offset by the aid to
religion. The dissents in Zelman v. Simmons-Harris n15 are illustrative of this
technique. They focus exclusively on the high percentage of voucher funds
reaching parochial schools while ignoring the enormous state financial aid,
through the public school system, for competing nonreligious educational
options. n16 From an "equal aid" point of view, the entire public school system
is a massive state aid program for nonreligious educational options which dwarfs
the more recent instances of minimal state aid to religious schools.

     [*552]

   Finally, it surely is true that aid to religion as part of an equal aid
scheme, available to nonreligion and religion alike, will breed political
controversy along religious lines. But it hardly follows that the aid to
religion must therefore be found to violate the Establishment Clause, while the
aid to the competing nonreligious activity proceeds unchallenged. From the
parochial school perspective, the state's decision to totally aid the competing
public schools while denying any aid to parochial schools doing the same job and
meeting the same public need is bitterly divisive along religious lines. The
fact that some public school beneficiaries of the unequal aid will later object
when modest offsetting aid is directed to parochial schools does not make the
offsetting aid the cause of the divisiveness. The state's decision to begin
providing any aid to education in the form of the public schools is the source
of the divisiveness over which educational opportunities get state aid and how
much. Conscious of these arguments, a majority of the Supreme Court's Justices
over the years have accepted Principle #1, at least at an intuitive level. Only
preferential aid for religion will be found to violate the Establishment Clause.
Equal aid, available to religion and nonreligion alike, will not be found to
violate the Establishment Clause.


   If only a minority of three or four Justices on the Court at any given time
have subscribed to the absolutist (but impossible) view that any government aid
to religion violates the Establishment Clause, what explains those early
holdings that certain equal aid programs violate the Establishment Clause when
religion is a recipient? And what explains the lengthy opinions by the majority
in recent cases attempting to justify the increasingly common holdings that
equal aid does not violate the Establishment Clause when religion is a
recipient? If my conceptual account of Establishment Clause jurisprudence is
accurate, one would expect the majority to simply invoke the common sense of
Principle #1 to justify recent holdings that government benefits to religious
institutions or individuals do not violate the Establishment Clause when they
are part of a generally available equal aid program. Instead, one finds opinions
for the Court and by concurring Justices obviously struggling with the question
before concluding that religious participation in a particular equal aid program
does not violate the Establishment Clause. The reason for this difficulty cannot
be found in further analysis of Principle #1. The answers lie in an analysis of
Principle #2.

     [*553]

   Principle #2


   Government may not promote or encourage, i.e., "endorse", any form of
religion over any other form or endorse religion over nonreligion.


   Virtually every member of the Court over the course of the development of the
Court's Establishment Clause jurisprudence has subscribed to some form of this
principle that, even without any material aid to religion, government
"endorsement" of religion will at some point constitute a violation of the
Establishment Clause. Some members of the Court have professed an aversion to
the term "endorsement" as too vague or too encompassing. n17 And some members of
the Court are unwilling to find government encouragement or promotion of
religion to be a violation of the Establishment Clause until it reaches the
extreme level of designating an official "state church." n18 But all of those
quibbles are over a matter of degree. All members of the Court over time seem to
have agreed on the basic proposition that government encouragement or promotion
of religion, even without any material aid, can reach a point where it will
constitute a violation of the Establishment Clause.


   Principle #2 is conceptually separate from Principle #1. It describes a
second way that the government can violate the Establishment Clause and thus
leads to a separate form of Establishment Clause analysis. Justice O'Connor is
credited with first having identified this form of Establishment Clause problem
and with having attached the descriptive name "endorsement" to the kind of
government action that gives rise to this type of Establishment Clause problem.
n19 Unfortunately, other Justices who intuitively subscribe to the underlying
principle, but will find Establishment Clause violations only when the
government encouragement is extreme (e.g., government designation of an official
"state church"), associate the term "endorsement" with instances of minor
government encouragement that these Justices do not feel are important enough to
warrant finding an Establishment Clause violation. They then condemn
"endorsement" as a defective doctrinal construct when what they  [*554]  really
mean is that instances of endorsement at the lower end of the scale do not
warrant a finding that the Establishment Clause has been violated. To avoid
invoking the discredited term "endorsement" when they confront what they view as
unconstitutionally excessive state encouragement or promotion of religion, these
Justices characterize such cases as incidents of subtle government "coercion."
n20 In spite of this tactical corruption of the term "endorsement," this paper
will continue to use the term as the author believes Justice O'Connor originally
intended it as the name for the entire collection of Establishment Clause cases
where the problem is government encouragement or approval of religion, rather
than material aid to religion.


   It becomes critical at this point to clearly understand the relationship
between Principle #1 and Principle #2. The two principles set forth two
different ways that a specific government action might violate the Establishment
Clause. Thus, any given government action must be measured against both
principles to assure that it does not violate the Establishment Clause in either
of the two possible ways. If a particular government program survives review
under Principle #1 (either because there is no material aid or because the
material aid is distributed equally without regard to religion) the program must
then be reviewed under Principle #2 to see if it nonetheless constitutes an
unacceptable level of endorsement.


   Here, one should recall the vote count that we began in the discussion of
Principle #1. In cases of equal government aid to religion and nonreligion
alike, three or four Justices will find a violation of the Establishment Clause
because in their view any aid to religion is a violation. On the other hand,
five or six Justices seem always to have been of the view that under Principle
#1 such equal aid does not violate the Establishment Clause when religion is
among the recipients. However, these five or six Justices must then proceed to
evaluate the equal aid program under Principle #2 to make sure that it does not
communicate an unacceptable level of endorsement. It is this second, often only
intuitive review of any equal aid program, looking for unacceptable levels of
endorsement, that produces the lengthy opinions from those Justices whose views
on aid are summarized by Principle #1. If some of these Justices find that an
unacceptable level of endorsement results from the otherwise constitutional
equal aid program, those votes, combined with the three or four  [*555]  votes
for the "no aid" rule, can produce a majority holding that the equal aid program
violates the Establishment Clause.


   Principle #3


   Any deliberate or direct violation of Principles #1 and #2 by the government
will be found to be a per se violation of the Establishment Clause, while an
accidental or inadvertent violation that occurs in pursuit of a non religious
government objective will result in the application of a balancing test.


   The government, in creating any equal aid program for nonreligion and
religion alike, does not set out to endorse, encourage or promote religion.
Thus, the five or six Justices who must proceed under Principle #2 to review a
neutral aid program for excessive endorsement will intuitively be looking only
for an unintended or accidental endorsement effect i.e., endorsement perceived
by the reasonable observer even though none was intended by the government.


   The phenomenon of accidental or unintended government endorsement of religion
as a consequence of an equal aid program must be studied carefully because an
intuitive concern for that unintended effect can produce the two or three votes
needed to add to the votes for the "no aid" position to produce a holding that a
particular equal aid program violates the Establishment Clause. Far more often,
however, the concern about accidental endorsement by the Justices who reject the
"no aid" position merely produces long multiple opinions in equal aid cases
explaining why those Justices found no Establishment Clause violation. Those
opinions make sense only as explanations that there is not too much accidental
or perceived endorsement resulting from that particular equal aid program. But
they often are ridiculed in dissent by the "no aid" Justices who view them as a
non-responsive or even perverse answer to the "no aid" position. The confusion
of the "no aid" Justices and outside observers is understandable because the
majority often does not clearly state at the outset that they reject the "no aid
" position in favor of the "equal aid" requirement and that they then are
proceeding to analyze the second separate question of whether the equal aid
program unintentionally or "accidentally" communicates to a reasonable observer
too much of a message of government endorsement of religion.

     [*556]

   Many of the majority opinions focus at great length on factors such as: the
amount of religious recipients versus the amount of non-religious recipients;
n21 whether the aid is in the form of cash or in the much less visible form of
tax breaks; n22 whether the direct recipient is a religious institution or an
individual who forwards the aid to a religious institution; n23 whether the aid
reaches religion "directly" from the state or as the result of a predictable
choice by an individual recipient; n24 and whether the administration of the aid
program results in visible associations between government and a religious
institution. n25 From the point of view of a "no aid" justice, consideration of
such factors is at best completely irrelevant and at worst infuriating. From the
point of view of a "no aid" dissenter, the majority in relying on these factors
seems to be saying that aid which is inconspicuous and covert is acceptable
while aid that is highly visible violates the Establishment Clause. While that
makes no sense at all from a "no aid" perspective, it makes perfect sense from
the perspective of one who sees equal aid as no Establishment Clause problem
unless it results in too much of an appearance of endorsement from the
perspective of reasonable observers. Stated another way, the problem is that
equal aid cases are analyzed as aid cases by the "no aid" minority while the
"equal aid" majority analyzes them as accidental endorsement cases. Confusion
and frustration on and off the Court are inevitable.


   When the five or six "equal aid" Justices intuitively analyze an equal aid
case as an endorsement problem, this group of five or six breaks into two
identifiable groups. Three of the five or six subscribe to the view that even if
government "endorsement" of religion raises an Establishment Clause problem,
accidental endorsement that occurs in the course of an equal aid program is not
a "real" Establishment Clause problem because it is a misperception, even if by
a reasonable observer. n26 These three Justices simply refuse to elevate public
misperception of the facts to the level of a constitutional problem with a
government equal aid program that in fact was not intended to endorse religion.
The remaining "equal aid" Justices view endorsement as a matter of what is
communicated to a reasonable observer no matter what was or was not intended
[*557]  to be communicated. n27 From this point of view, there has in fact been
endorsement if that is what is communicated to a reasonable observer, even
though the government intended no such message.


   Return now for a moment to the vote count. Recall that we had three or four
"no aid" votes to strike down any equal government aid reaching religion and
five or six who would strike down the equal aid program if it involved excessive
endorsement. Three of those five or six refuse to consider accidental
endorsement to be an Establishment Clause problem. Those three then will never
strike down a true equal aid program where any endorsement is accidental. Those
three votes are set off against the first three or four who will always vote to
strike down an equal aid program. This leaves the two or three who feel the need
to protect against excessive accidental endorsement, even if it is a
misperception by a reasonable public. The determination by one or two of these
remaining two or three on the level of accidental or misperceived endorsement by
the public will determine the outcome of the case. In other words, the analysis
of an equal aid program as an accidental endorsement case will determine the
constitutionality of an equal government aid program. Thus, the presence or
absence of those factors that make an equal aid program seem to a reasonable
public like a government endorsement of religion will control the outcome of the
case. The more inconspicuous or covert the program is, or the more it seems to a
reasonable public to be in fact equal aid, the more likely an equal aid scheme
is to survive constitutional challenge.


   Most recently, in Zelman v. Simmons-Harris, the Justices who appear to be
genuinely concerned about accidental or "perceived" endorsement in equal aid
cases joined in a majority opinion by Chief Justice William Rehnquist that
announced something of a black-letter rule. According to Chief Justice
Rehnquist, whenever an equal aid program distributed the aid to individual
recipients and the aid reached religious schools only through the independent
choice of those third parties, the Court has found the perception of endorsement
to be minimal, and the equal aid program has been sustained. n28 Justice
O'Connor, the justice historically most inclined or most able to articulate the
concern for perceived endorsement, filed a concurring opinion devoted almost
entirely to demonstrating that the aid was equal and reached the religious
[*558]  schools only by the free choice of the recipient parents. n29 Thus,
Chief Justice Rehnquist's opinion, finding that perceived endorsement was
satisfactorily minimized by this critical fact alone, seems to have accurately
captured Justice O'Connor's assessment of this case and the previous three cases
on which the Chief Justice relied. n30


   The Problem


   In Zelman, the various Justices dutifully followed the script outlined for
them above, and the resulting five to four outcome was therefore predictable. If
any jurisprudential progress was made, it was only in the clarity with which
some of the opinions, particularly Chief Justice Rehnquist's opinion for the
majority five, articulated the analysis outlined above. To support their
characterization of Zelman as an equal aid case, the majority opinion and
Justice O'Connor's concurrence pointed out that the overwhelming bulk of state
aid went to nonreligious educational options offered through the public schools,
and the voucher aid to religious schools was miniscule by comparison. The
program only reduced, but did not eliminate, the substantial economic incentive
to choose one of the nonreligious educational options offered by the state
through the public school system rather than the religious education option
assisted by the voucher aid. Once the voucher program was correctly classified
as an equal aid case (at least more equal than the status quo before the
vouchers), the Rehnquist opinion invoked the near-black-letter rule that equal
aid distributed to third party recipients, through whose choice the aid reaches
religious schools, does not present any unacceptable risk of "perceived"
endorsement and is then upheld against Establishment Clause challenge.


   Justices David Souter and John Paul Stevens in dissent asserted rather
mechanically that "any aid" reaching religious institutions should be found to
violate the Establishment Clause. They seemed to dismiss earlier cases
sustaining equal aid programs as theoretical deviations that were more or less
harmless because they involved very small amounts of aid. In addition, both
Justices predictably attacked the majority's characterization of Zelman as an
equal aid case by focusing only on the overwhelming percentage of voucher funds
going to religious schools, while insisting that the much greater aid in the
[*559]  form of new or existing public school programs must be ignored as
irrelevant. n31 Justice Breyer's opinion in dissent for himself and Justice
Ginsburg (with Stevens and Souter joining) begins by endorsing the Stevens and
Souter dissents asserting the mechanical "no aid" position that this article
argues is analytically unsatisfactory. n32 Thus, all three of the dissenting
opinions appear to discredit themselves at the outset. However, both the Souter
and Breyer dissenting opinions suggest that they may be aware, at least
intuitively, of a serious problem with vouchers for religious schools that did
not exist in any other case of equal aid challenged under the Establishment
Clause and that cannot be described in the terms of any existing analytical
construct. In other words, Justices Souter and Breyer may have had no way to
express their concern about voucher programs in doctrinal terms other than the
easily discredited and consistently rejected "no aid" argument.


   A casual reader of the Souter and Breyer dissents will see them asserting the
"political divisiveness" argument n33 easily dismissed above in this article and
in Chief Justice Rehnquist's majority opinion in Zelman. n34 A closer reading,
however, suggests that Justices Souter and Breyer were not simply asserting the
somewhat silly argument that political opposition to equal aid to religion can
be expected from the beneficiaries of the unequal status quo. Justices Souter
and Breyer may be saying (and if they are not, this author will say) that
widespread and substantial state aid to institutions of religious indoctrination
is a very bad idea even if it is allowed by the equal aid analysis above and
even if it may be required by the unconstitutional conditions analysis above. It
is a very bad idea for reasons that do not apply to any other case of equal aid
ever faced by the Court. But the candid expression of those reasons would assure
the application of the unconstitutional conditions doctrine and require the
conclusion that it would be unconstitutional to exclude religious schools from
government aid.


   The Souter-Breyer version of the "politically divisive" argument seems to
suggest that religion, in general, and schools of religious indoctrination, in
particular, are politically divisive in the sense that they are disunifying.
They work against the "melting pot" process that has developed a common
political culture out of waves of immigrants. Stated another way, the public
schools have been a primary agent of political and cultural homogenization in
the United States. It is in the public schools that children of all ethnic,
geographic,  [*560]  religious, philosophical, and political backgrounds have
been indoctrinated in the fundamental civic values on which the nation depends
for its existence and well being. We have succeeded in creating a single nation
out of many peoples only because the public schools have succeeded in their
mission of mass indoctrinization (and because the Catholic parochial schools
have mimicked the public schools in this respect, in spite of early fears to the
contrary). If this admittedly over- generalized observation about the critical
role of a common school system is anywhere near accurate, it would be downright
foolish for state government to make it easier for students to escape the
unifying indoctrination in the public schools in favor of schools dedicated to
indoctrinating their students with disunifying religious and cultural belief
systems.


   Justice Souter points out that the Catholic Church teaches the immorality of
the death penalty, many Jewish schools teach a form of religious Zionism,
Muslim's teach the necessity for differential treatment of the sexes, and
Southern Baptists teach that a wife is obligated to follow the commands of her
husband. n35 He politely overlooks more extreme religiously based views such as
the view that Muslims are obliged to wage an unrelenting holy war in order to
kill infidels, the view that the white race was assigned a position of
superiority over non-whites, the view that women should be confined to a second
class legal and social status, and the view that the only legitimate form of
government is a theocracy enshrining the belief system of a particular religious
movement. With the inclusion of these more extreme examples, Justice Souter's
point becomes clear: it would be the height of folly for the state to facilitate
indoctrination in those views. The corollary remains unspoken: it makes perfect
sense for the state to offer a reward of six to eight thousand dollars worth of
free education if you attend the public schools and subject yourself to
communitarian indoctrination that repudiates those disunifying views.


   Unfortunately, candid recognition of the indoctrination and socialization
role of the public schools, and candid recognition that widespread attendance at
public schools is accomplished by the offer of a very valuable state-supplied
education, would present an apparently insurmountable constitutional problem.
Your right to attend a private school dedicated to the inculcation of
antidemocratic, anticommunitarian views is guaranteed by both the Free Speech
Clause and the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. Offering a very
valuable state benefit on the condition that you forego your right to attend
such  [*561]  a private school directly violates the unconstitutional conditions
doctrine. In this case, there would be no doubt about the applicability of the
doctrine because the state's acknowledged objective would be to deter or
penalize the exercise of the right by rewarding those who forego the right.
Stated another way, you would be rewarded by the state with an education worth
eight thousand dollars per year if you agree to submit to indoctrination in
state-approved civic values.


   This largely unarticulated constitutional dilemma is the central problem in
cases of vouchers for religious schools or other private schools dedicated to
the teaching of disunifying values. In most of the currently operational voucher
schemes, the state has tried to finesse this problem (or "have its cake and eat
it too") by requiring that all participating private schools agree not to
implement or advocate certain disunifying values. For example, the Ohio voucher
scheme at issue in Zelman requires as a condition of receiving the aid that no
participating school discriminate on the basis of religion or "teach hatred of
any person or group on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, or
religion." n36 Surely the deliberate condition that one modify the message of
one's advocacy in order to receive a valuable state benefit is the clearest kind
of unconstitutional condition in violation of both free speech and free exercise
of religion.


   The constitutional dilemma identified above exists only because all schools
public and private, religious and nonreligious are unavoidably engaged in
indoctrinating values. This problem does not exist, or exists only in minimal
form, with state aid to other types of religious institutions such as soup
kitchens and other "charitable" works. The problem has not been confronted in
religious school aid cases until Zelman because the aid programs remained
minimal compared to the massive financial incentive to attend public school
rather than the aided religious school. Furthermore, it turns out that, contrary
to early fears, the Catholic parochial schools that have been the primary
recipients of past religious school aid have been at least as vigorous as the
public schools in inculcating the civic values on which the life of the nation
depends. But the Souter and Breyer dissents accurately note that we are now
beginning to face radical religious diversity including some religious belief
systems fundamentally at odds with our foundational civic values. And unlike the
minimal aid involved in previous school aid programs, "the money has barely
begun to flow" n37 compared to what is possible through voucher schemes.

     [*562]

   Summary


   To summarize, there have been three ideological camps on the U.S. Supreme
Court in cases of equal or neutral government aid to religion and nonreligion
alike. The first camp is the minority of Justices who subscribe to the view that
any aid at all to religion constitutes a per se violation of the Establishment
Clause even if the aid is part of an equally available aid program. (Three or
four votes to find a violation in every case of equal aid.) The second camp is
the three Justices who find no Establishment Clause problem with neutral aid as
such, who theoretically then review the case as an "endorsement" case, but who
refuse to accept "perceived" endorsement as an Establishment Clause problem
where no endorsement was intended. (Three votes for sustaining an equal aid
program in every case.) The third camp is the remaining two or three Justices
who find no Establishment Clause problem with neutral aid as such, who then
review the case as an "endorsement" case, and who then attempt to determine
whether the level of accidental or "perceived" endorsement is too great to
accept in view of the nonreligious objectives of the state and in view of the
other means by which those objectives might be pursued with less "perceived"
endorsement.


   Thus, the three principles set forth at the outset of this paper account for
the result, although not the rhetoric, of virtually every Establishment Clause
case from the earliest to the most recent. The analytical approach summarized by
these three principles also appears to be based on the sounder logic. As noted
earlier, the "no aid" view appears to be internally inconsistent and appears to
be in conflict with the requirements of Free Exercise Clause and the Free Speech
Clause operating through the unconstitutional conditions doctrine.


   However, none of the results from implementing the equal aid approach up
until Zelman have raised the specter of massive state aid for the advocacy of
views fundamentally at odds with essential civic values, while simultaneously
reducing or eliminating the enormous financial inducement for submitting one's
children to inculcation of essential civic values in a common school setting.
But voucher schemes for private, particularly religious, schools now raise
precisely that specter the dismantling of the common school system in favor of a
system of state- supported, religiously and socially ghettoized schools, some of
which overtly acculturate their students in values flatly contrary to those on
which the continued viability of this nation depends. Can such a result be
constitutionally permissible under the Establishment Clause and constitutionally
required by the Free Exercise and Free Speech Clauses through the operation of
the unconstitutional conditions doctrine?


   What are we to do? "Quo vadis?"

Rating Action: Moody's assigns Aa2 to $750M of NYC TFA Building Aid Revenue
Bonds; outlook stable

LENGTH: 1650  words

DATELINE: New York


Moody's Investors Service has issued the following press release:

Moody's Rating

Issue: Building Aid Revenue Bonds, Fiscal 2015 Series S-2; Rating: Aa2; Sale
Amount: $750,000,000; Expected Sale Date: 06-15-2015; Rating Description: Lease
Rental: Appropriation

Opinion

Moody's Investors Service has assigned a Aa2 rating to the New York City
Transitional Finance Authority's (TFA) $750 million Building Aid Revenue Bonds,
Fiscal 2015 Series S-2. The bonds will be sold over a three-day period starting
June 15, 2015.

SUMMARY RATING RATIONALE

The Aa2 rating on the TFA Building Aid Revenue Bonds (BARBs) is one notch below
New York State's Aa1 rating and reflects the state's strong commitment to
provide building aid payments to New York City (Aa2 stable). The rating also
reflects the subject-to-appropriation nature of the state aid payments securing
the bonds, the state's constitutional mandate to fund education aid, a statutory
framework that assigns the city's state building aid to the TFA, and
non-impairment provisions.

OUTLOOK

The bonds carry New York State's stable outlook. The outlook reflects our
expectations that the state will preserve and improve upon the gains it has made
in governance and its financial position.

WHAT COULD MAKE THE RATING GO UP

-- Stronger protection for the pledged revenues

-- State rating upgrade

WHAT COULD MAKE THE RATING GO DOWN

-- Significant decrease in debt service coverage

-- State rating downgrade, which could be triggered by growing structural budget
gaps and reliance on non-recurring resources for recurring expenses.

OBLIGOR PROFILE

New York State is the 3rd largest US state by population. Located in the
Northeastern US, New York has a large and diverse economy with high per capita
income at 121% of the US average and gross state product of $1.227 trillion.

The TFA was created in 1997 as a vehicle to fund a portion of New York City's
capital program. The TFA Building Aid Revenue Bond program was authorized by the
School Financing Act of 2006 to finance city educational facilities with the
backing of state aid revenues.

LEGAL SECURITY

Bonds Secured By Confirmed State Building Aid To New York City, Subject To
Annual Appropriation

In 2006, the TFA enabling act was amended pursuant to the School Financing Act
to change the way the state provides support for New York City's educational
capital plan. The amended law authorizes the issuance of building aid revenue
bonds of up to $9.4 billion outstanding to finance educational facilities;
$6.676 billion of this authorization is currently outstanding, not including
this issuance. Under the act, the city assigns to the TFA all of the state
building aid payable to the city, under Section 3602.6 of the state education
law.

Educational projects in New York City's education capital plan, including new
construction, building additions, and rehabilitations, are eligible for state
building aid. When a project goes into contract, the School Construction
Authority submits it to the State Education Department (SED). The SED approval
process establishes an "aidable cost" of the project and creates a 30-year
amortization schedule. Once SED has approved the project, the state is
statutorily required to provide a 30-year stream of building aid payments,
subject to annual appropriation.

The stream of building aid payments is a function of both the aidable cost and
the current funding ratio, and provides the security for the bonds. The SED
determines the amount of confirmed building aid payable annually by applying a
building aid ratio to the amount of aidable debt service for the year. The base
building aid ratio has varied in past years and could vary in future years. For
New York City schools, it averaged 51% from 2005 to 2010. The ratio has
generally drifted down since 2010, and the city projects it will be 47.3% in
fiscal 2016.

BARBS Subordinate to Pre-2007 Future Tax Secured Bonds

The TFA issues Future Tax-Secured Bonds backed by city personal income and sales
taxes. Future Tax-Secured Bonds issued prior to Series 2007 S-1 have a senior
claim on state building aid if tax revenues are insufficient to pay debt
service. The risk of recourse to building aid to pay the senior claim is slim
since the amount of pre-2007 bonds outstanding is a small portion (8%) of total
tax-secured bonds outstanding and coverage of the tax-secured bonds by tax
revenues approaches 10 times.

State Non-Impairment Covenant Adds Bondholder Protection

The state has covenanted not to impair the rights of bondholders in any way.
Although the state is able to vary the building aid ratio on a year-to-year
basis, which alters the amount of confirmed building aid payable to the city, we
believe that given the covenant the state is not likely to reduce its building
aid payments below the amortization level initially calculated for each project,
with the provision that the interest rate used in the calculation may be reset
every 10 years.

Further supporting bondholder security is the fact that the state aid intercept
provision of Section 99-B of the School Finance Law is available to these bonds.
However, since the 99-B program provides for post-default payment, with the
state comptroller withholding education aid in amounts required to pay debt
service if necessary, it does not add to the credit rating assigned to this
transaction.

Competing Claims to Building Aid

New York City's education aid is subject to certain competing claims, including
those from holders of State of New York Municipal Bond Bank Agency Special
School Purpose Revenue Bonds. These claims are minimal in amount. There are also
contingent competing claims from the 99-B intercept post-default program,
holders of New York City Education Construction Fund Revenue Bonds, and possible
withholdings by the state if the city fails to provide certain educational
services. Through a memorandum of understanding (MOU) between the city, the TFA,
the State Education Department, and the New York State Comptroller, the state
comptroller has agreed to satisfy such competing claims from other school aid
before state building aid. New York City has agreed to pay to the TFA any
amounts of building aid that may be diverted for these claims.

1.0 Times Additional Bond Test Based on Historical Annual Confirmed Building Aid

The additional bonds test (ABT) requires 1.0 times coverage of outstanding state
building aid appropriation bond debt service by confirmed building aid revenue
in every year. This ABT does not rely on any future approval of New York City
education capital projects or on the associated incremental building aid: it
relies solely on approved projects for which the state has committed to provide
a 30-year stream of building aid payments subject to annual appropriation.

Based on confirmed building aid through 2044 and debt service on outstanding
Building Aid Revenue Bonds as well as projected debt service on the Series 2015
S-2 bonds, debt service coverage falls from 2.12x times in 2015 to a minimum of
1.01 times in 2044, reflecting the matching of confirmed state building aid to
amortization schedules. As New York City continues to add capital projects for
education in the future, incremental associated building aid will be added,
increasing coverage and providing more debt capacity.

MOU Establishes Flow of Building Aid

Each year the state annually appropriates money to New York City to pay for
educational needs of the city's students. A portion of this aid constitutes the
state building aid. Until 2006, the state did not distinguish between the
payment of education aid and building aid, making one lump sum payment to the
city. To secure the bonds and separate building aid from the rest of the
education aid, pursuant to the MOU the city, TFA, SED and the state comptroller
determine the amount included in each general education aid payment that is
attributable to state building aid. Prior to each general education aid payment,
the TFA is required to calculate and certify to the SED, the comptroller and the
state budget director the amount of the building aid payment included in each
general education aid payment.

Additionally, a constitutional mandate to fund education supports the inclusion
of appropriations for educational aid, including building aid, in the state's
annual budget.

USE OF PROCEEDS

Proceeds of the Series 2015 S-2 bonds will be used to pay a portion of the costs
of educational facilities for the City of New York.

Does it work?

LENGTH: 1225 words

DATELINE: Nepal


Nepal, July 15 -- Although considerable progress has been made in its
socio-economic development, Nepal is often assumed to be becoming more and more
aid dependent. The country is struggling to maintain economic growth and there
has always been resource gap that is partially fulfilled by foreign aid. It
should, however, be understood that foreign aid is only a tool to support
development. Primarily, we should analyze where and how we have erred in our
economic development trajectory. Many of the challenges toward effective aid
mobilization require reforms that go beyond aid management to broader aspects of
government processes.

While not all aid succeeds in its objectives, it is not always true that aid
encourages dependency. Its effectiveness depends on how and where it is used.
For instance, food aid to some districts in the Mid-western and Far western
Development Region made people dependent on imported food rather than
encouraging them to produce their own.

However, it is not wise to blame all aid money. Aid can help countries achieve
sustainable economic growth and graduate from aid dependence. Failure in one
specific project or area should not be generalized as failure of all types of
aid. No country is self-reliant today and Nepal still needs foreign aid despite
more than six decades of independance. The volume of aid should increase if we
wish to realize our dream of graduating from LDC status.

Difficult to assess

Effectiveness implies efficient use of aid money. Human Development Index, GDP,
Millennium Development Goals and Paris Declaration Evaluation/Monitoring
Principles are tools that can measure aid effectiveness. Despite the
international community addressing aid effectiveness through the Paris
Declaration and the subsequent Accra Agenda for Action, the implementation of
this agenda has proved difficult. According to these Principles, the major
objectives defining "good" aid are those that foster the recipient countries'
ownership of development policies and strategies, maximize donors' coordination
and harmonization, and improve aid transparency and mutual accountability of
donors and recipients, to name a few. According to Nepal's Monitoring Survey on
Paris Declaration 2011, there has been progress on all effectiveness measures.

It is, however, difficult to establish strong correlation between aid and
development. One reason is the fungibility and use of aid for unproductive
expenditure in public sector. Moreover, at micro level, all donor agencies as
well as implementing partners regularly report the success of their projects and
programs. This contrast is known as the micro-macro paradox. Assessment of aid
is further complicated where the money is a combination of government and
international support.

Enhancing effectiveness

There is growing realization among development partners, governments and civil
society alike on the need to work together on aid and development policy. It is
necessary to coordinate donor practices and clearly define current and future
roles of the government and civil society in aid delivery and management. In the
context of Busan Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation, there are
steps which can be taken to improve aid mobilization in Nepal.

Nepal's aid project portfolio spans more than 500 projects, which is not a
healthy number. A threshold aid amount should be set for aid projects (including
grants and loans) so that the number of projects can be minimized to a more
manageable figure. If any development partner wishes to mobilize aid below the
threshold, they would be encouraged to opt for pooled funding, joining other
partners to help deliver the intended project.

Engaging fewer but larger initiatives will allow development partners to gain
economies of scale and a higher return on their investments while making it
easier for the government to manage and coordinate their work.

Moreover, Sector Wide Approaches (SWAPs) are yet to be adopted in sectors beyond
health and education. In case the key line ministry is hesitant, the lead
development partner(s) in the respective sector should support the sector
ministry initiate this task.

The government should be selective in foreign aid, identifying niche area(s)
like hydropower, highways, airports, large irrigation projects, agriculture and
tourism. It should be able to say "no" to assistance which does not support
national priorities and which will not be reflected in government budget.

The government should attempt to bring maximum aid into its budget. Development
partners should regularly report aid information to Aid Management Platform at
the Ministry of Finance.

The government should initiate a downward accountability mechanism at the
district level, forming a Development Coordination Committee led by a DDC
Chairperson/LDO. This mechanism may help smooth the implementation of foreign
aided projects and minimize corruption. The government should encourage civil
society and private sector to participate in existing aid coordination
mechanisms like Local Donor Meeting and NPPR.

While smarter risk-mitigation techniques should be employed, development
partners also need to be prepared to take more risks, recognizing that this will
increase the potential for higher returns. They should try to minimize risk
jointly rather than avoiding it.

Increasing use of country systems to channel aid should be a priority. Good
practices should be taken on board by emerging donors so that all aid providers
are guided by a single framework.

Development partners should provide clear commitments on their planned support,
and be held accountable for these commitments and for achieving the results they
forecast.

Political parties should prioritize economic agenda. There should be common
consensus that political problems require political solutions. For instance,
announcement of annual budget should not be delayed for political reasons. On
the other hand, development partners should ensure that aid is not manipulated
for political advantage.

INGO engagement should be linked to national plans and programs. Line ministries
as well as development partners should effectively track aid money being
channeled through INGOs.

Parliament and other constitutional bodies need to actively oversee aid provided
to support national development plans. Oversight agencies can monitor foreign
aided projects in many ways, such as ensuring sufficient budget is released, and
contracts are tendered, audit reports submitted, and reimbursements are made on
time. However, such actions should not affect the implementation of projects.
Civil society also needs to be more involved in aid management. They can monitor
activities of local projects.

Similarly, the media should publicize the progress of government and development
partners. Aid works better in a country with an effective state and good
governance. Aid worked in Nepal even during the 10-year-long conflict, and it
will work more effectively once the political situation is stable and economic
agenda receives priority.

Audio-Visual Aids in Teaching

LENGTH: 698 words

DATELINE: Srinagar


Srinagar, April 26 -- Teacher and student are the two main constituents of the
teaching-learning process. Teaching aid refers to the teaching tools used in the
process of teaching. Audio-Visual teaching aids can be categorised into three
kinds viz. Audio-aids, Visual aids, and Audio-Visual aids.

(A) AUDIO-AIDS:The first category of aids is Audio-Aids. Audio-aids help in
developing the listening skill of an educand. Audio-aids are those aids which
can be only listened. Examples, of such types of aids include, radio,
gramophone, tape recorder, audio-tapes, walkman, and headphones etc.

(I) TAPE RECORDER:

A tape recorder consists mainly of three parts-the microphone, the amplifier and
the receiver. The talks of eminent personalities, educationists, academicians
and scientists can be recorded and reproduced in the classroom through this
teaching aid. The important merit of this audio-teaching aid is that the speech
of a person can be recorded at any time and it can be used for a number of times
at will, again and again.

(II) RADIO:

Radio programmes can be categorised into two types. One type of radio programme
is called education radio-broadcasts, which provides opportunity to the teachers
and students to listen to the programme and take notes on them. The teachers
should discuss the programme, the main points of the radio lesson, the lecture,
the dialogue and the characters, etc., with the students to supplement, evaluate
and consolidate their learning.

The other type of radio programmes are those where a general discussion or
information on social issues, health and diseases, culture and life, about the
events happening around the world etc. are broadcasted. As a follow-up activity,
these programmes also supplement the presentation of a teacher in the classroom,
whenever they are deemed fit for the discourse.

(III)AUDIO-CASSETTES: Audio-cassettes can be used for recitations of nursery
rhymes, poems and stories, etc.

(B) VISUAL-AIDS: The second category of aids is Visual-Aids. Aids which require
the involvement of learners' visual senses are called visual aids. Examples, of
such types of aids include viz. graphic aids, 3d-aids, display boards, and print
material etc.

(C) AUDIO-VISUAL AIDS: The third category of aids is Audio-Visual aids. In these
aids both the listening (ears) and viewing faculties (eyes) are involved. Such
aids include television programmes, video films, motion pictures, synchronised
audio-slide projectors, computers and computer-assisted instructions etc.Cartoon
films are also a useful medium for developing, and chiselling the skills of the
students.

(I) FILMS: Films represent an effective instructional device to cater to the
students' attention and create interest and motivation among them towards
effective learning. Educational films may be prepared on any content material or
any aspect of knowledge, and behavior.

(II) TELEVISION: Television is a versatile medium of transmitting education
through different programmes. It is an exciting means of communication. Useful
instructional programmes are being telecasted regularly for the student
community on television. A teacher should utilize the T.V. programmes and make
them the basis for discussions on relevant occasions.

(III) VIDEO: Video is a viableaid towards effective learning and teaching.
Teaching with the help of video is called video-aided instruction. In
video-aided instruction, learners' comprehension is generally tested through a
questionnaire and video is clearly an instructional medium that generates a much
greater amount of interest and enjoyment than the more traditional printed
material.

(IV) CDs: Nowadays, educational video-cassettes are easily available in the
market. Educational CDs can be prepared on any aspect of the subject-matter and
curriculum.

Thus, these aids help the students in multifarious ways, satisfying their needs
and avoiding monotony.The more interested and engaged the students are, the more
interactive each learning session will be. Published by HT Syndication with

Did you hear that?;
New aids bridge life of sounds with your lifestyle

Hearing aids - those two words alone may conjure up images of unattractive,
beige devices that your father or grandmother once wore before finally throwing
them in a drawer, never to be seen again.

But hearing aids have come a very long way. Here are five things you may not
know about today's digital hearing aids:

Adaptable.

Hearing aids can adjust automatically based on your listening situation. Digital
hearing aids of the past required you to manually switch programs depending on
your environment (for example noisy vs. quiet). The latest hearing aids are
smart enough to recognize up to six distinct listening environments: quiet,
speech in quiet, noise, speech in noise, car or music. The hearing aids
continuously detect which of the six situations you're in and automatically
switch settings for the best hearing in that environment.

Wireless headset.

Hearing aids can act like your own personal headset. Most people who have
hearing loss have it in both ears and need two hearing aids. Wireless hearing
aids "talk" with each other, so touching the volume control or program switch
for one hearing aid automatically adjusts both.

Today's hearing aids are personal electronics that work with your high-tech
gadgets. You can wirelessly stream music into your hearing aids from an iPod,
hear a call that just came in on your smart-phone, and listen to the TV with no
delay at your preferred volume, without disturbing others.

Activity-proof.

You can swim, sweat and ski while wearing hearing aids. In 2011, Aquaris, made
by Siemens, was the first digital waterproof, dustproof and shock-resistant
hearing aid. Waterproof hearing aids aren't just for swimmers either. Because
they are so robust and stay securely in place behind the ear, many people can
benefit, including those who perspire heavily, are active in sports, or who
garden or work in dusty environments.

Battery-free.

Hearing aids are rechargeable. If the idea of having to change tiny batteries
once a week (or more) makes you cringe, you're not alone. With rechargeable
hearing aids, there's no more constant fumbling with batteries. According to Dr.
Gabrielle Filips of Siemens Hearing Instruments, people with arthritis,
Parkinson's disease or other conditions that create dexterity problems can
really struggle with opening battery packages, accessing a battery compartment
and guiding a battery into place.

Rechargeable hearing aids are also friendlier to the environment - and our
wallets. Over a three-year period, two rechargeable hearing aids and a charging
station cost less than three year's worth of weekly disposable batteries.
They're easy to use, too. At night, you place the hearing aids into a charger,
and every morning you'll have freshly charged hearing aids.

Invisible.

Hearing aids can be invisible. Like contact lens wearers, most people still want
to be discreet about their hearing aids. The stigma associated with wearing
hearing aids still ranks among the top reasons why consumers choose not to
purchase them. But with invisible hearing aids, only you know you're wearing the
device.

HIV/AIDS

A ha!
Know your facts
IT started as a mysterious infection among homosexual men, but over two
decades HIV/AIDS (Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired Immuno Deficiency
Syndrome) exploded into the worst epidemic humanity has ever faced. It now
afflicts as many women as men. It's a sad reality that millions of people
are living with HIV and AIDS. As you read this, communities are being
devastated and people from all stratas of society are dying every day.

World AIDS Day (Dec 1) is about keeping up the fight against HIV and
AIDS and fighting the prejudices faced by people with HIV.

Do you call a friend who is infected with HIV an AIDS patient or HIV-
positive person? Well, here's a list of the more common politically
correct terms to use when addressing the AIDS community and some not so
politically correct ones.

AIDS: Often confused with HIV, AIDS describes a stage where your immune
system is very weak and may be prone to opportunistic infections. This
condition is caused by the virus HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) which
in turn causes the infected immune system to deteriorate over a period of
time. The virus multiplies in the body's cells and destroys them. It may
take 10 years or more for a person with HIV to develop AIDS.
Alternatively, use the terms HIV infection or HIV positive or HIV/AIDS.

Full-blown AIDS: No such term. This implies that there is such a thing
as half-blown AIDS.

AIDS Victims/Sufferers: These terms suggest that People Living With
HIV/AIDS are powerless and have no control over their lives. Use the
internationally recognised term, People Living With HIV/AIDS.

Innocent Victims: Usually used to describe HIV positive children or
people with medically acquired HIV infection. It wrongly implies that
people who get infected in other ways are guilty of something or immoral.

AIDS patients: Use "AIDS patient" to describe someone who has AIDS. Most
of the time, a person with AIDS is not truly a patient. Alternatively, use
Person Living with AIDS or HIV, or HIV positive person.

AIDS Carrier: You can't be infected with AIDS. It is the HIV virus that
infects people. Alternatively, use HIV positive person, Person Living with
HIV/AIDS, People living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA)

AIDS test: The correct term is HIV Antibody Test. The test does not test
for AIDS or for the HIV virus, but for the antibodies our bodies produce
to fight the virus.

AIDS: AIDS is an acronym. Writing it as "aids" may confuse it with
"aids", as in "helps".

Free sex/ promiscuous sex/ sex out of wedlock: The term should be "safer
sex". You can't get HIV just from having sex outside of marriage or having
multiple partners. HIV infection occurs through unsafe sex.

Drug Addicts: The more sensitive term should be "drug user".

Prostitute: The more sensitive and less derogatory term to use is "sex
workers"

Dispel the myths and learn the truth.

1) HIV is the same as AIDS.

This couldn't be further from the truth. HIV is a virus and AIDS is a
host of illnesses. Knowing the difference between the two is a very
important part of understanding both.

2) HIV only affects gay men and drug users.

HIV can infect anyone. Babies, women and people of all races are at
risk.

3) We both have HIV ... we don't need a condom.

Not true. Experts are seeing more and more incidences of re-infection,
making HIV treatment even more difficult.

4) People over 50 don't get HIV.

Don't bet on it. In fact, people over 50 make up a rapidly growing
segment of the HIV population.

5) I have HIV... I can't have children.

This used to be true but not anymore. (Women living with HIV can and do
have families. Certain steps and precautions, however, must be taken).

6) We don't need a condom for oral sex.

A very dangerous myth. Condoms must be used for each and every sexual
encounter: vaginal, anal and oral.

7) My family doctor can treat my HIV.

Experts believe that given the complexities of HIV care, only HIV
specialists should manage your care. Be sure to choose a doctor who cares
for HIV patients regularly.

8) HIV can be cured.

While many make claims of miraculous cures, the sad truth is there is no
cure for HIV. Be careful of claims or cures and miracles. If it sounds too
good to be true, it probably is.

9) Why don't we have a vaccine? It should be easy!

While progress is being made, vaccine development is not without its
challenges and difficulties. Many experts feel we are still many, many
years from an affective HIV vaccine.

10) I have just been diagnosed ... I am going to die.

This is the biggest myth of all. In fact, people are living with HIV
longer today than ever before. Meds, treatment programmes and a better
understanding of HIV allows those infected to live normal, healthy and
productive lives.

The global AIDS epidemic statistics
Estimated number of adults and children newly infected with HIV during
2001

People newly infected with HIV in 2001: five million.

AIDS deaths in 2001: three million, including 1.1 million women and

580,000 children under 15. That's over 8,000 deaths per day.

Estimated number of people living with HIV/AIDS at the end of 2001: 40

million.

Total of AIDS deaths at the end of 2000: 21.8 million.

Total number of AIDS orphans: 13.2 million.

The UNAIDS 2002 statistics update shows Africa, with 29.4 million people
living with HIV/AIDS, as the region most badly affected. Eastern Europe
and Central Asia, with 1.2 million cases, has the fastest growing epidemic
but Asia, particularly China and India, are the real time bombs. An
estimated one million people in China are infected with HIV and unless
effective responses take place, the number could reach 10 million -
equivalent to the entire population of Belgium - by the end of this
decade.

False beliefs in cure doom AIDS project;
 Misperceptions about the success of new drugs hurt volunteer efforts to fight
the disease.

It was still possible to get to know Eugene Tyrus after he died of AIDS in 1990.
His mother, Margaret Tyrus of Ogunquit, stitched a panel for him on the national
AIDS quilt, a memorial that circulates across the country.

On the panel are images of a camera, a church and musical notes, images that
speak of what Gene loved in life. And there are the dates of his birth and
death, dates that say AIDS kills in Maine.

Soon, Mainers will have to leave the state to see Gene Tyrus' panel or any other
part of the AIDS quilt. The Maine chapter of the national Names Project, a
non-profit group that displayed the quilt across the state for 10 years, is
closing down because it has run out of volunteers.

What killed the project, and what threatens support for other Maine HIV/AIDS
groups, is a misperception about new drug therapies that are letting some people
with HIV and AIDS live longer. The treatments represent long-sought progress in
fighting AIDS, but they are not a cure.

"People do see the good news, and say . . . it's not as big as a deal as it used
to be," said Michael Ashmore, chairman of The Names Project chapter. As a
result, the group's membership has dropped from a high of 40 a few years ago to
just four, too few to maintain regular exhibits of the quilt.

The Names Project's problems are not unique. Around the state, organizations
that help people with HIV and AIDS and teach AIDS prevention say volunteerism
has dropped with the news of successful AIDS drugs. Public interest in HIV and
AIDS has also dwindled nationally.

"What you're seeing (in Maine) is absolutely reflective of what we're seeing,"
said Sally Morrison of the American Foundation for AIDS Research, based in New
York City. "When news about the protease inhibitors came out, after that, some
people stopped giving. They felt the work is done."

Protease inhibitors are a newer class of AIDS drugs that physicians began
combining with other drugs more than two years ago. The drug "cocktails" have
been so effective that in some infected people, the AIDS virus has fallen to
undetectable levels in the bloodstream.

The drugs also have slowed the AIDS death rate. Maine saw 70 deaths from AIDS in
1995, and 26 in 1996. Statistics for last year are not complete, but Sally-Lou
Patterson of the state's Bureau of Health said the trend toward fewer deaths is
likely to continue.

These widely reported successes have obscured the fact that the new treatments
do not work for everyone. Also, some people who find the drugs effective suffer
terrible side-effects that diminish their quality of life.

Maine's AIDS organizations say their work is far from over.

"The general public that I speak to when I do HIV-prevention information seems
to think it's basically over," said Mary Harney of the Down East AIDS Network,
which serves Hancock and Washington counties. "We've got the drugs and people
aren't generally dying. So people are moving their energy to other causes."

Brian McAuliffe agreed that the urgency the public felt about AIDS and HIV in
the 1980s and early '90s seems to have passed. McAuliffe is president of the
board of directors of the Coastal AIDS Network, based in Belfast.

"Unless it directly involves you personally, or a family member or a loved one,
people are kind of putting it on the back burner and not seeing it as so
critical as it was," McAuliffe said.

AIDS groups in Maine have generally sustained their fund-raising, but the Down
East Aids Network, the Eastern Maine AIDS Network, Dayspring AIDS Support
Services, the Coastal AIDS Network and the Merrymeeting AIDS Support Service all
report difficulty in recruiting volunteers.

AIDS educators in Maine say the popular perception that AIDS is beaten also has
led a disturbing number of young people to believe they can't get infected, or
will be cured if they are.

At The Names Project, volunteers scheduled and set up 40 to 80 displays of the
AIDS quilt annually in Maine and southern New Hampshire. Though memorializing
AIDS victims was one mission, the group also emphasized educating the public,
particularly schoolchildren, about the existence and dangers of AIDS.

Such education is a vital part of preventing the spread of the disease, Ashmore
said.

"What the quilt represents and brings home to the children is, AIDS is a real
thing which affects real people," Ashmore said.

Without that education, there will be more people like her son who die of AIDS,
Margaret Tyrus said. "It will fly right back at us."

AS WORKERS TRAVELED, AIDS EFFORT FLAGGED;
MONEY SPENT ON CONFERENCES ATE INTO CARE, RECORDS REVEAL

When St. Louisans were dying of AIDS in record numbers and the city was running
out of money to fight the disease, AIDS workers spent dwindling funds traveling
to conferences nationwide.

More than half of the St. Louis Health Department's travel budget in a two-year
period - $ 87,280 - went for travel by employees of St. Louis Metro AIDS, a
regional prevention and outreach program based in the city's Health Department.

As the number of AIDS cases rose steadily in 1995 and 1996, 21 of the 29 Metro
AIDS workers traveled to conferences in San Francisco; Seattle; Los Angeles;
Vancouver, British Columbia; and other places.

Metro AIDS workers took 63 trips - more than a third of the trips taken by the
St. Louis Health Department's 275 employees. Of the trips taken by Metro AIDS
workers, 53 were for conferences and 10 were for official meetings.

They spent 250 days away from the office.

Meanwhile, from September 1995 to June 1996, some AIDS patients couldn't get
dental exams or prescriptions because the state ran out of money after
accumulating more than $ 1 million in unpaid bills for AIDS treatment. The state
recommended that Metro AIDS turn away new clients.

A record 247 people died of AIDS in 1995 in St. Louis.

Metro AIDS, which distributes state and federal money to AIDS programs, had to
cut back on social services, housing and transportation for AIDS patients.
Because Metro AIDS couldn't accept new patients, the exact amount of lost
services is unknown. During the last budget year, the prog ram's budget was $
3.3 million.

Metro AIDS also had to cut the money it provides for local AIDS groups, such as
Blacks Assisting Blacks Against AIDS, which lost about $ 72,000 during this
period. The group had to lay off one of three social service coordinators
serving more than 200 clients.

"It was difficult," recalled Erise Williams Jr., executive director.
Particularly difficult, he said, because few resources exist for blacks with
AIDS, who account for 60 percent of AIDS cases in St. Louis.

The Post-Dispatch examined the Health Department's travel records, including the
Metro AIDS program, for the city's 1996 and 1997 fiscal years. The Metro AIDS
program spent $ 47,363 during the two-year period from July 1, 1995, to June 30,
1997.

Don Conner, manager of Metro AIDS, said sending his staff to conferences was
appropriate. Information about AIDS is constantly changing, he said, and
employees need updating.

Sending staff to conferences helps to reduce their stress, Conner said.

"The work we do is grim," he said. "I think that when they have the opportunity
to go to conferences where they are with others who do the same kind of work,
they come back energized knowing that they are not the only ones burned out."

Presiding City Judge Irene J. Smith questioned the need to attend so many
conferences at a time when the city's AIDS assistance program was in a financial
crisis. "It appears priorities were misplaced," said Smith, a former city
alderman who led an investigation last year of the Health Department.

Smith questioned trips taken by Deborah Butler McGruder, a federal grants
manager for Metro AIDS, a frequent traveler. During the two-year period,
McGruder went on five trips - one to Los Angeles, one to San Francisco and three
to Washington.

"Why should the grants manager have to go on a conference because of stress?"
Smith asked. "She doesn't directly deal with clients."

McGruder said that the federal agency awarding grants to fund Metro AIDS
mandated two of her Washington trips.

"I do a lot of traveling to Washington, D.C., because that's where the funding
is," McGruder said.

The other conferences helped to improve her skills and keep her updated, she
said.

Making Sacrifices

Metro AIDS spent nearly twice as much on travel in a year than the mayor's
office and five times more than the Board of Aldermen, city records show.

At about the same time, the city lost several million dollars in AIDS grants
because Dr. Kathryn Vedder, former director for the St. Louis Health Department,
failed to meet deadlines.

"We made sacrifices," Conner said.

In October 1995, a month after state money to help fund services to AIDS clients
served by Metro AIDS ran out, the department sent five managers to Los Angeles
for the National Skills Building Conference, designed for administrators of AIDS
programs.

The trip cost $ 7,296. Workers were gone for five days.

Six months later, Metro AIDS spent $ 7,239 to send six more workers to San
Francisco for the National AIDS Update Conference. Four workers stayed in
California for a week while one was gone for six days and another for five.

And in October 1996, eight Metro AIDS workers went again to the National Skills
Building Conference, held this time in Washington.

That cost $ 11,712. Eight workers were gone five days.

The five who went to the 1995 National Skills Building Conference also went to
the one in 1996.

That trip alone would cover the cost of testing 1,952 clients for HIV, which
causes AIDS. Or it could pay for 1,464 tests to detect gonorrhea or chlamydia,
sexually transmitted diseases that can make a person more susceptible to
contracting HIV.

The three trips - totaling $ 26,247 - cost more than the annual travel budgets
for some health departments, such as in Denver and Minneapolis.

In 1996, more than 650 new cases of AIDS or HIV were reported in the St. Louis
area. In May, the city and county reported 3,025 AIDS cases and 1,572 cases of
HIV.

Health officials expect the number to surge in the next five years because of
the area's high rates of sexually transmitted diseases.

"For a city our size, we certainly have a significant problem," Conner said. He
explained that AIDS treatment, especially the last six months of a patient's
life, is expensive.

It 'Doesn't Look Good'

Conner acknowledged that Metro AIDS could have moved administrative funds, used
to pay for travel, lodging and conference registration, into the program's
operating budget so services could be provided to AIDS patients.

Conner said he wanted to give his staff the chance to go to at least one
national conference a year. Conner is the only Metro AIDS worker employed by the
city. The other workers are not city workers; they are private contractors.

In the Health Department's sexually transmitted disease division where Conner
spent 16 years, continuing education is inadequate, he said.

"I do not approve every conference that is requested," Conner said. "Our people
don't go to conferences to play. They are sitting in the conf erence sessions.
At night they might play hard, but they are (in the conference sessions) from 9
a.m. to 5 p.m."

Public health agencies must be careful about sending workers to conferences
because trips cost taxpayers, explained Bernard Turnock, a former health
commissioner for Chicago and Illinois.

Sending five or more people to one conference "doesn't look good," said Turnock,
a public health professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Nor does
sending one person to five or more conferences a year.

Better to send one person to a conference, Turnock said, and have that person
teach colleagues what was learned.

That's what the Chicago Health Department tries to do, a spokesman said.  Or,
instead of sending staff to conferences, the health department might bring in
experts to lecture or train its employees.

Activists from national AIDS groups agreed that conferences can refresh and
update workers. But with tight budgets, they say sometimes it's better to spend
money on client services or community programs.

"It's hard," said Kurt Schada, a community correspondent for the AIDS Action
Council, a nonprofit group in Washington that deals with federal policy on AIDS
and HIV. "New information does help us do our work, but a place can't be sending
people all over if it's strapped for funds."

Most AIDS groups make sure to disseminate the latest information, Schada said.
The AIDS Action Council, for example, regularly faxes, phones, sends electronic
mail and posts on the Internet the latest in formation on policy.

Living with AIDS Gwinnett middle schooler teaches other kids about his disease

When he was in third grade, Brett Lykins surprised his friends during
show-and-tell. Instead of showing a book or family pictures he bravely told his
classmates at Chattahoochee Elementary School in Gwinnett County that he had
AIDS. At the time, Brett remembers worrying because he didn't know if his
friends would tease him or be mean to him.

"They were real quiet, but they didn't act funny or anything," Brett said. "Many
of them said they had heard the word AIDS, but didn't know what it was."

Brett is now 13. He's a seventh grader at Duluth Middle School. His schoolmates
there have been friendly. And they haven't treated him as special or different.
By knowing Brett, they have learned more about AIDS.

Brett was infected with the virus in 1980, right after his birth. he was born
three months premature, which means he was born earlier than most babies. he had
to have injections of blood, called transfusions, to survive. He got the AIDS
virus through one of those transfusions.

There is no cure for AIDS, but Brett is being treated with an experimental drug
call 3-TC. The only other time Brett goes to a doctor is when he gets a cold or
fever, just like other kids.

Brett also visits other schools to speak to students about AIDS. Usually it's
the first time the kids have ever met someone with the disease.

About AIDS

AIDS stand for Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. AIDS causes the body's
immune system - the system that helps fight sickness - to fall apart. Because
the system fails, a person with AIDS will develop illnesses that lead to death.
AIDS is caused by HIV infection. That stands for Human Immunodeficiency Virus.
HIV enters the body through the bloodstream. A person can have HIV for years
without developing AIDS.

It's OK to hug someone with AIDS. It's OK to shake their hand, or pat them on
the back. You cannot get AIDS through casual contact with someone who has the
disease, or is infected with HIV.

Take this AIDS Quiz

True or False:

1. You can get AIDS if someone with the virus sneezes or coughs near you.

2. You can get AIDS by attending school with someone who is infected with HIV.

3. You can get HIV from objects such as clothes or telephones.

4. You can play with someone who has AIDS. This doesn't make you sick.

5. You shouldn't hug, shake hands or touch someone who had the HIV virus.

ANSWERS:

1. False. HIV infection doesn't just happen. You can't catch it like a cold or
flu. It is not spread by coughs or sneezes.

2. False. Kids with the HIV virus cannot pass it along by sitting in a classroom
or participating in school activities.

3. False. AIDS can't be passed on by things like spoons, cups, toiler seats or
other objects.

4. True. You cannot get AIDS by playing with someone who has the disease.

5. False. You cannot get AIDS through casual contact.

   LUSAKA - Dr. Kristina Baker is in a race against time and death.

Faced with frightening predictions that AIDS may kill one million Africans in
the next decade, the Zambian doctor is waging her own personal war against the
deadly disease.

When she travels through Zambia's countryside, Baker hands out pamphlets on AIDS
to bewildered soldiers at roadblocks. On weekend nature hikes, she visits small
rural villages and distributes posters and T-shirts printed with the warning:
"Don't Let AIDS Ruin Your Life." In the city, when approached by a beggar, she
hands him money - and an AIDS prevention pamphlet.

She recently wrote a handbook on AIDS that has been distributed to every
high-school student in Zambia. Now she is busy setting up a national network of
"Anti-AIDS Clubs" to encourage school children to go out into their communities
and warn people about AIDS and how to avoid it.

The den in her Lusaka home is crammed with pamphlets and posters that warn: "
AIDS Kills." In one corner of the room, there is a large stack of video tapes on
AIDS that she circulates privately to schools, churches, libraries and community
groups.

"I'm trying to stop the worst from happening," Baker says simply, when asked
about her one-woman crusade.

"There can't be any doubt now," she adds. "AIDS is a very major public health
problem right across central Africa."

* In Lusaka, one in every three blood donors between the ages of 30 and 35 has
tested positive for exposure to the AIDS virus.

* In some villages in Uganda, missionaries report an entire generation has died
of AIDS, leaving only the very young and the very old alive. In the capital,
Kampala, scientists say one in every five sexually active adults is infected
with AIDS.

* In Nairobi, Kenya, more than 90 per cent of the city's street prostitutes have
tested positive for AIDS.

* In Kinshasa, Zaire, a city of 4 million, a major hospital reports that 25 per
cent of all its recorded deaths are now AIDS related;

* In Rwanda, 22 per cent of the country's AIDS victims are newborn babies, who
contracted the disease from their infected mothers.

Baker says she is unwilling to get caught in controversial and politically
sensitive discussions on the magnitude of the AIDS threat facing Africa or the
potentially devastating social and economic damage the disease might inflict on
the continent.

As a doctor, she says, her only concern is the prevention of a deadly disease.

"Don't ask me how big the problem is," she insists. "Don't ask me if it's a
disaster. All I know is that it is here. It exists. And the only thing that
matters is trying to prevent it from spreading."

A sense of urgency creeps into her voice, spurred on by international experts
who predict AIDS may sweep through Africa with the same fury as the Plague in
the 14th-century, which killed nearly one quarter of Europe's population.

A recent study, AIDS in the Third World, by the London-based Panos Institute,
warns AIDS may wipe out huge segments of Africa's population, shatter national
economies, undermine fragile political systems and destroy entire societies.

"Epidemiologists believe that while the United States and Europe face deaths
measured in the millions, some African countries may face severe depopulation,"
the institute reports. "A few go so far as to suggest that the worst-hit parts
of Africa may lose 50 per cent of their people."

The World Health Organization, based in Geneva, estimates more than one half of
all the AIDS cases in the world may be in Africa, even though countries there
have reported just a few thousand deaths from the disease.

A recent report by the organization says some African countries may already face
an AIDS crisis so severe that one fifth or more of their urban populations may
be infected with the AIDS virus and are likely to die.

Even more frightening is the fact AIDS is spreading through Africa at a rate
four times higher than the rest of the world. The number of people infected by
the AIDS virus in Africa doubles every six to eight months.

AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) is caused by a virus that damages the
body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer.

It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by
drug users, infected blood or blood products and by pregnant women to their
offspring.

In developed Western countries, homosexuals and drug users are the main victims.
But in Africa the disease is spread primarily by sexually active hetrosexual
adults, with men and women sharing almost equally in the numbers of identified
victims.

Because the AIDS virus attacks the human immune system, it leaves its victims
more susceptible to other infections and diseases such as dysentery, malaria,
tuberculosis, polio and measles.

As a result, experts now predict the rapid spread of AIDS in Africa will
undermine decades-old immunization programs that were gradually improving life
expectancy on the continent.

According to Dr. Peter Piot, a microbiologist from the Institute of Tropical
Medicine in Antwerp, Belgium, 30 to 40 per cent of Africa's tuberculosis victims
may also be infected with the AIDS virus.

Diseases once on the decrease in Africa are now blooming anew. In areas of
western Kenya, cerebral malaria is now endemic; in northeastern Uganda, sleeping
sickness is reaching plague-like levels; and Nigeria has just been hit with an
outbreak of yellow fever, a disease that had almost faded from Western Africa.

On an economic level, AIDS is stripping Africa of the very people on whom it
depends for development. The population group hardest hit by AIDS are sexually
active adults aged 18 to 40.

Worse yet, in a continent where the reservoir of skilled people is severely
restricted, AIDS will have sweeping social ramifications.

In Zambia's crucial copperbelt area, which produces 90 per cent of the nation's
export earnings, 68 per cent of the men who have been infected with the AIDS
virus are skilled professionals and tradesmen.

At another level, the AIDS epidemic is bound to place severe strains on Africa's
already fragile economies. Swamped by debt, suffering from sharply falling
incomes and troubled by foreign aid cutbacks, African states will find it almost
impossible to cope with the extra financial burden of AIDS.

While Canada and the U.S. are spending millions on AIDS research, many African
hospitals can't even afford the bleach needed to disinfect their needles and
test tubes.

"Africa has the largest gap between the seriousness of the problem and the
resources available to deal with it," says Dr. Jonathan Mann, director of the
World Health Organization's AIDS program.

The African countries hardest hit by AIDS have virtually no effective medical
services, no testing laboratories and no statisticians to keep track of the
disease's progress.

The cost of caring for 10 AIDS patients in the U.S. (about $450,000) is greater
than the entire budget of a large hospital in Zaire, where 25 per cent of the
children and adults admitted may be infected with the AIDS virus, the U.S.
journal Science reported recently.

With no cure for AIDS, no vaccine and no immediate prospect of either in sight,
public education programs similar to those launched by Dr. Baker are Africa's
only hope.

But two years ago, most African governments were still balking at launching AIDS
prevention programs and vehemently denied AIDS was a threat to their
populations.

They were reluctant to report suspected AIDS cases to the World Health
Organization and sometimes threatened journalists, doctors and foreign medical
researchers with deportatrion for even suggesting Africa faced an AIDS epidemic.

Today, that's changing.

In Zambia, the government is introducing an aggressive education program to
combat AIDS through comic books, popular music, television, travelling theatre
groups, poster campaigns and car bumper sticker promotions.

"As more and more people see their relatives and friends die, everyone has come
to the realization that prevention is the only tool we've got," says Baker. "
AIDS is not a disease you can cope with by dealing with those who have got it.
You've got to stop it before it starts."

A SYMPOSIUM ON ANTITRUST AND THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC CRISIS: The Approach to State
Aid in the Restructuring of the Financial Sector

NAME: Dr. Lorenzo Coppi & Dr. Jenny Haydock *

BIO:


* Dr. Lorenzo Coppi is a Vice President in the London office of Charles River
Associates, with over twelve years of experience in advising clients in Europe
and in the United States on the economics of antitrust in a full range of
competition cases. Dr. Jenny Haydock is a Senior Associate in the same office,
where she has worked on a variety of cases, including State Aid investigations,
mergers, allegations of abuse of dominance, and cartel behavior.

 LEXISNEXIS SUMMARY:
 ... In the Commission's own Common Principles, distortions of competition
(along with effects on trade) are given as the negative effects of aid which
must be weighed against the positive effects in the Balancing Test.  ... As
illustrated in this article, this criterion is equivalent to one which considers
as structurally sound only those banks that had enough capital to withstand the
fair economic value of the losses that emerged during the financial crisis (that
is, those banks which would have been solvent in the absence of the market
failures which characterized the financial crisis). .  ... Even in the case of
additional aid, because of the large number of institutions that received some
form of aid and because of the specificities of the financial sector, moral
hazard is often a more significant concern than distortions of competition in
the relevant product markets, which are not likely to be significant. .  ... Aid
Was an Effective Tool to Tackle the Financial Crisis and Achieved its Goals
State aid has been provided to address the market failures discussed above and
to avoid banks failing: the guarantees have been granted to avoid bank runs and
to allow interbank markets to become more liquid; the impaired asset schemes
have been introduced to allow a "fair value" pricing of illiquid assets; and the
recapitalizations provisions have been necessary to allow banks to make risk
provisions to cover remaining impaired (or risky) assets in their balance sheets
and because banks are now forced to put back more equity capital to cover their
loans.  ... While both types of aid can be provided "to remedy a serious
disturbance in the economy of a Member State," the aid proportionate to solving
the breakdown in financial markets (the "lemons problem" and the ensuing crisis
of confidence) should be sufficient to allow structurally sound banks to return
to viability, will result in only limited distortions of competition, and thus
should not be subject to compensatory measures.

TEXT:
 [*77]  The unprecedented nature of the financial crisis in autumn 2008 led the
European Commission to approve a series of state support measures for the
financial sector under Article 87(3)(b), which allows for aid to be considered
compatible with the common market if it is "to promote the execution of an
important project of common European interest or to remedy a serious disturbance
in the economy of a Member State." There was a consensus that the very serious
financial crisis constituted a "serious disturbance" to the European economy.

   There are minimal precedents on the use of Article 87(3)(b), and therefore
the Commission has advanced a framework for the analysis, especially in its
communication, The Return to Viability and the Assessment of Restructuring
Measures in the Financial Sector in the Current Crisis under the State Aid
Rules. This paper discusses that communication and the appropriate framework for
analyzing aid to the financial sector given under Article 87(3)(b).

 [*78]  I. Introduction
In this article, we comment on the European Commission's Communication: The
Return to Viability and the Assessment of Restructuring Measures in the
Financial Sector in the Current Crisis under the State Aid Rules, (the
"Restructuring Communication"), published by the European Commission (the
Commission) on its website on July 23, 2009.

   The unprecedented nature of the financial crisis in autumn 2008 led the
Commission to approve a series of state support measures for the financial
sector under Article 87(3)(b), which allows for aid to be considered compatible
with the common market if it is "to promote the execution of an important
project of common European interest or to remedy a serious disturbance in the
economy of a Member State." There was a consensus that the very serious
financial crisis constituted a "serious disturbance" to the European economy.
The effects of the crisis persist today and are likely to be felt for some time.

   Given their urgency, the measures had to be approved without a full analysis
of the State aid being granted, but the Commission set a timeframe of six months
to review them and to determine whether they were compatible with State aid
rules. The Commission is now in the process of carrying out this ex-post
evaluation of the State aid provided to the financial sector.

   There are minimal precedents on the use of Article 87(3)(b), and therefore
the Commission has advanced a framework for the analysis in various
communications. This paper discusses the appropriate framework for analyzing aid
to the financial sector given under Article 87(3)(b) and concludes that:


     . The recent financial crisis was an event of exceptional severity
     which had many characteristics of a market failure (major confidence
     crisis, evidence of panic, irrational behavior, bank runs, market
     breakdown).

     . As a result of these market failures and of the significant risk to
     the economy that these represented, Member States provided aid to
     financial institutions which was approved under Art. 87(3)(b).

     . Because, from the standpoint of economic efficiency, aid given to
     remedy a significant disturbance in the economy is much better
     justified than standard Rescue and Restructuring aid, aid given under
     Art. 87(3)(b) should be considered using a different approach from
     that of Rescue and Restructuring aid under Art. 87(3)(c).

     . The appropriate approach to evaluating aid given under Art. 87(3)(b)
     is the Balancing Test indicated by the Commission in its Common
     Principles for an Economic Assessment of the Compatibility of State
     Aid Under Article 87.3.

     . The Balancing Test requires the Commission to weigh the costs of the
     aid, in terms of market distortions, against the benefits in terms of
     [*79]  financial stability (the remedying of a "serious disturbance"),
     and not to require structural compensatory measures for their own
     sake.

     . The Commission should distinguish between aid necessary to remedy
     the market failures of the financial crisis and aid given to banks to
     cover losses from flawed or risky business models. This article
     advances a framework for quantifying the proportionate and the
     additional tranches of aid.

     . Banks that received only proportionate aid (or that can repay the
     additional aid in full) should be considered "structurally sound" (as
     defined in this article) and should not be required to present a
     restructuring plan. As illustrated in this article, this criterion is
     equivalent to one which considers as structurally sound only those
     banks that had enough capital to withstand the fair economic value of
     the losses that emerged during the financial crisis (that is, those
     banks which would have been solvent in the absence of the market
     failures which characterized the financial crisis).

     . While both the proportionate aid and the additional aid should be
     considered compatible aid under Art. 87(3)(b), it is reasonable to
     require that they give rise to different levels of compensatory
     measures.

     . Because proportionate aid only addresses an exceptional, systemic
     market failure, it is unlikely to result in appreciable moral hazard
     or distortion of competition in the relevant product markets, and
     thus--at most--only behavioral measures should be required for this
     type of aid.

     . Additional aid, on the other hand, can be thought of as the aid
     necessary to bail-out financial institutions which were not
     structurally sound regardless of the crisis. It may be reasonable to
     impose some level of structural compensatory measures with regard to
     this type of aid, but these measures should be proportional to the
     tranche of additional aid granted, rather than to the full amount of
     aid.

     . Even in the case of additional aid, because of the large number of
     institutions that received some form of aid and because of the
     specificities of the financial sector, moral hazard is often a more
     significant concern than distortions of competition in the relevant
     product markets, which are not likely to be significant.

     . This suggests that--even in the case of additional aid
     --burden-sharing and behavioral measures (which target moral hazard
     directly) are often more appropriate than asset sales (which attempt
     to remedy distortions of competition in the relevant product markets).


      [*80]  . In addition to not being necessary, significant asset sales
     run the risk of endangering financial stability and slowing the return
     to fully-functional financial markets, thereby jeopardizing the very
     goal of the aid, and should therefore be considered very carefully.

   The plan of the paper is as follows: In the next section we discuss the
financial crisis and its market failure features. We then discuss the
appropriate approach to evaluating state aid in the context of this exceptional
financial crisis and we conclude that the standard Rescue and Restructuring
("R&R") framework developed in the context of Art. 87(3)(c) is wholly inadequate
to assess aid given under Art. 87(3)(b). In section III, we propose a framework
to analyze aid under Art. 87(3)(b) which is consistent with the Commission's own
policy (the Balancing Test), and we devise a rigorous framework to identify the
structurally unsound banks, as well as to separate the aid granted into a
proportionate and an additional tranche. Section IV discusses the implications
for the compensatory measures that the Commission is evaluating and Section V
concludes.

II. The Inadequacy of the Standard Art 87(3)(c) R&R Framework to Analyze Aid
under Art 87(3)(b)
For some months now, Europe and the rest of the world has been in the grip of a
profound and pervasive financial crisis, more severe than any since the 1930s.
As the European Commission stated in its April 2009 update of the State Aid
Scoreboard, "The world economy is currently experiencing its severest financial
and economic crisis in almost a century."  n1

   As the Commission has highlighted, the crisis "equally affected financial
institutions whose difficulties stemmed exclusively from the general market
conditions which had severely restricted access to liquidity . . . the crisis
hit also banks that could normally not be considered 'companies in
difficulties'."  n2 Several financial institutions that entered the crisis in
good health saw their financial positions gradually deteriorate as a result of
the worsening of the financial crisis and its effects on the real economy.

   Faced with this unprecedented crisis, the European Commission provided
guidance in the form of various communications to Member States as to the State
aid rules applicable to State support for financial institutions during the
crisis.  n3 The Commission has recognized the exceptional nature of the crisis
and the need for an unprecedented response, given the "systemic nature of the
crisis" and to the "interconnectivity of the financial sector" which renders it
unique.  n4

    [*81]  It is indeed the case that the financial sector is unique, both in
terms of its role in the economy as a whole, and also in terms of the
interdependence of rival firms.  n5 As well as playing a crucial role in the
economy as a whole, through the provision of loans and other banking services
crucial to the running of any business, firms in the financial sector are
interlinked and interdependent in a way that is not the case in other
industries: first, because of interbank lending and other interactions; and
second, because the reputation of and faith in the whole sector can be shaken by
the removal of faith in just one institution.  n6

   The Commission correctly stated that--given the exceptional nature of the
crisis and the uniqueness of the financial sector--the R&R framework was not
appropriate to analyze aid during the financial crisis and that the crisis
required a fresh approach to State aid  n7 and, for this very reason, the
Commission resorted to Art. 87(3)(b).  n8

   We agree with the Commission that the framework of R&R under Art. 87(3)(c) is
not appropriate to analyze aid that has been given under Art. 87(3)(b). The
rationale and context of Article 87(3)(b) is different from that of standard R&R
aid. The role of ad-hoc R&R aid is to rescue and restructure firms that would
have failed under normal market conditions. As indicated in the R&R guidelines,
R&R aid is an extreme measure which usually is not consistent with the efficient
functioning of a competitive market (see paragraphs 4 and 8 of the R&R
guidelines).

   There is broad economic consensus that ad-hoc R&R aid has tenuous
justifications from the standpoint of economic efficiency and can, in fact,
result in serious market distortions. By simply keeping an otherwise failed firm
in business, or making it stronger in the market than it otherwise would be, the
aid can create inefficiencies, in which less-efficient firms serve customers who
could be more efficiently served by other firms. Furthermore, as with all aid,
it can distort future incentives for firms as they anticipate future State aid
and create moral hazard. Because of its tenuous justification from the
perspective of market efficiency, ad-hoc R&R aid is subject to fairly strict
(almost punitive) "compensatory" measures in order to ensure that the normal
functioning of competitive markets is not hindered by State intervention.

   This is not the case with aid awarded under Article 87(3)(b). This aid has a
clear justification: "To promote the execution of an important project of common
European interest or to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of a Member
State." A serious disturbance is likely to involve significant market failures;
the correction of which is quite justified from an economic perspective since,
properly performed, it renders the market more efficient, rather than less so.

    [*82]  Thus, while R&R aid is not consistent with the efficient functioning
of markets, aid under Article 87(3)(b) is compatible with economic efficiency
and, indeed, this aid attempts to return markets which have been hit by a
serious disturbance to a normal and efficient situation. It is important that
these observations are always carried forward in order to fully consider their
implications in terms of the nature and motives of the aid and, thus, the
appropriate action to be taken at the time.

   The aims of restoring viability to the financial sector and protecting future
financial stability, are sensible and well-justified goals and should constitute
the guiding principle of any State aid analysis under Art. 87(3)(b). Of course,
there may be costs involved in such interventions, but these may well be
outweighed by the positive effects. And it is here that the analysis of such
State aid must start, in line with the Commission's own "Balancing Test," as
outlined in the Common Principles as an overarching methodology to assess State
aid under Art. 87(3): "The assessment of the compatibility of an aid is
fundamentally about balancing its negative effects on trade and competition in
the common market with its positive effects in terms of a contribution to the
achievement of well-defined objectives of common interest."

   The application of the Balancing Test serves to ensure that three key
objectives stated in the Restructuring Communication--stabilizing the financial
system, ensuring that aid is kept to the minimum, and minimizing distortions of
competition--do not clash against each other. In the next section, we apply the
Balancing Test to the State aid given in the context of the financial crisis.

III. Applying the Balancing Test to Art. 87(3)(b)
The Balancing Test proposed by the Commission to analyze Aid under Art. 87(3)
has three pillars, which can be formulated as three key sets of questions:


     . Is the aid aimed at a well-defined objective of common interest? Why
     is the State aid needed? Why can the private sector not deliver the
     objective?

     . Is the aid well designed to deliver the objective of common
     interest? Is aid appropriate? Is there a positive incentive effect? Is
     the aid proportionate to the problem tackled?

     . Are distortions of competition and trade limited?


In the rest of the section we provide answers to these questions.

A. AID AIMED AT A WELL-DEFINED OBJECTIVE: THE FINANCIAL CRISIS AS A MARKET
FAILURE
The Common Principles correctly state that the main economic rationale of State
aid is to remedy a market failure (and/or to improve equity and social
cohesion).  [*83]  In this case, it is useful to distinguish between two types
of market failures: those that lead to a breakdown of financial markets; and the
negative externality that a failed financial institution imposes on other
financial institutions and, ultimately, on the economy.

   As to the market failures that led to the financial crisis, although the
specific reasons for and the concatenation of events that led to the financial
crisis in autumn 2008 are still being debated, it appears clear that risk
mispricing, unrealistic expectations and short-termism, excessive leverage,
asset price bubbles, and moral hazard followed by panic have been important
elements of the financial crisis.

   All these factors can be characterized as "market failures" in economic
terms. As a result of these market failures, credit markets and, in particular,
money markets had completely broken down in autumn 2008, endangering even
structurally sound banks. Banks found their balance sheets interspersed with
impaired assets for which there was no market, despite most of these assets
having positive value outside of a crisis situation.

   It is a well-recognized problem in economics that information asymmetry may
lead to market failure and, possibly, market breakdown. If a proportion of the
goods available are known to be of low value, but these goods cannot be
differentiated by buyers from goods of higher value, the price that buyers are
willing to pay for the goods will fall to the point that no seller in possession
of a higher-value product will offer it for sale, and so the market for the
goods will shrink and may collapse. This is known as the "lemons" problem, after
Nobel laureate George Akerlof's seminal contribution.  n10 Thus, even those
banks with certain valuable assets found it difficult or impossible to gain an
acceptable price for them, because buyers could not distinguish them from
so-called "toxic" assets which were of little or no value.

   This "lemons" problem quickly spread from affecting single assets to
affecting entire financial institutions. As investors became uncertain as to the
quality of financial institutions' assets, concerns started to surface about the
health and viability of financial institutions. As FED Chairman's Ben Bernanke
stated: "At the root of the problem is a loss of confidence by investors and the
public in the strength of key financial institutions and markets."  n11 Once
this crisis of confidence started to develop, investors became unwilling to lend
to financial institutions, and financial institutions became unwilling to lend
to each other, effectively precipitating the whole financial system into a
potentially fatal liquidity crisis. At this point, the "lemons" problem had
become a confidence crisis caused by uncertainty over whether the banks would
survive.

    [*84]  While the "lemons" problem had, in part, caused the breakdown in
financial markets, a second source of market failure exacerbated it and
escalated it into a severe crisis. Given the interconnectivity of the financial
system, the failure of one bank imposes a negative externality on another bank.
In economics, a negative externality means that there is likely to be
overprovision of a good if the market failure is not corrected, meaning in this
case that banks would fail even when the failure was not efficient, from
society's perspective. This second source of market failure is indeed what can
potentially turn a financial crisis into a "serious disturbance of the economy,"
which requires State aid in order to be remedied.  n12 However, this externality
is a basic feature of the financial markets, and thus not exceptional (what was
exceptional was the number of banks that could have failed and thus the
potential severity of this negative externality).

   Compare these market failures to the typical situation of ad-hoc R&R aid
under Art. 87(3)(c), in which markets continue to function normally; there are
no specific market failures such as externalities, asymmetric information,
coordination failures, or incomplete markets. In that situation, it is typically
a single firm--the recipient--that has failed to compete in normal market
circumstances. It is clear that the justification for and the wider benefit of
aid under those circumstances are significantly less compelling.

   In the next section we propose a methodology for identifying aid to remedy
the first type of distortion (the "lemons" problem)--which can be considered
capital support provided by the state that is short-term in nature and a prudent
bolstering of banks' capital positions--from "bail-out aid" to banks that did
not have a viable business model (independently of the crisis) and thus should
restructure.

B. AID AS A WELL-DESIGNED INSTRUMENT: EFFICACY AND PROPORTIONALITY
The second leg of the Balancing Test assesses whether the aid is a well-designed
instrument. This requires aid to satisfy three principles: (i) that aid is an
appropriate tool to tackle the market failure(s) identified; (ii) that aid can
bring about a solution to the market failure problem; and--most importantly for
the purpose of assessing aid under Art. 87(3)(b)--(iii) that aid is
proportionate to the problem tackled.

1. Aid Was an Effective Tool to Tackle the Financial Crisis and Achieved its
Goals
State aid has been provided to address the market failures discussed above and
to avoid banks failing: the guarantees have been granted to avoid bank runs and
to allow interbank markets to become more liquid; the impaired asset schemes
have been introduced to allow a "fair value" pricing of illiquid assets; and the
recapitalizations provisions have been necessary to allow banks to make risk
provisions  [*85]  to cover remaining impaired (or risky) assets in their
balance sheets and because banks are now forced to put back more equity capital
to cover their loans.

   Aid was necessary in order to remedy the market failure and/or to avoid the
risk of systemic financial failure. In particular, one of the most effective
ways to solve the "lemons problem" is by means of an asset guarantee, as it
removes the unobservable risk of default that is the root cause of the breakdown
in financial markets.

   There is a consensus that these instruments were appropriate, and that the
State support measures have been successful to bringing some degree of
stabilization to the financial markets (even though financial markets are not
yet completely back to normal). The first two criteria of the "appropriateness"
leg of the Balancing Tests are therefore satisfied.

2. The Use of the Proportionality Principle to Differentiate Between Different
Types of Aid
The proportionality principle requires that aid is kept to the minimum necessary
to achieve its benefits. The reasoning behind this is perfectly legitimate. It
is important to make sure that State support is not used to bolster a bank's
financial position beyond what is required by the current market circumstances,
and that it is not used to pay shareholders. In other words, even a serious
crisis does not permit the writing of a "blank check."

   In this context it is important to distinguish the aid that was proportionate
to solve the crisis-specific market failures, from the additional aid that was
necessary to rescue banks that would have been unviable in any case. While both
types of aid can be provided "to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of
a Member State," the aid proportionate to solving the breakdown in financial
markets (the "lemons problem" and the ensuing crisis of confidence) should be
sufficient to allow structurally sound banks to return to viability, will result
in only limited distortions of competition, and thus should not be subject to
compensatory measures.

   Any additional aid would be rendered necessary by the excessively risky
actions of banks, rather than by the failure of the financial markets. Even if
this additional aid was necessary to avert a potential catastrophe, it must be
considered that the reason why this second type of aid was necessary was that
some banks had overstretched themselves, and thus had contributed to creating
the breakdown in financial markets in the first place. Thus this aid may warrant
some compensatory measures, to avoid significant distortions of competition.

 [*86]  3. A Practical Approach to Applying the Proportionality Principle
A practical way to apply this proportionality principle, to distinguish between
different tranches of aid, would be the following:


     . Start from the bank's balance sheet before the financial crisis.

     . The Committee of European Banking Supervisors (CEBS) and the
     European Central Bank (ECB) should establish the parameters of a "no
     financial crisis" market scenario.

     . Value the bank's assets on the basis of commonly agreed "fair
     economic value" methodologies--this should result in a certain amount
     of required write-downs from the pre-crisis market value of the bank's
     asset base (the "fair economic value losses").

     . For that part of the asset base which affects regulatory capital,
     calculate the difference between the value of the asset base during
     the crisis and the pre-crisis fair economic value of the asset base
     (the "market failure losses").  n13

     . Calculate the amount of capital needed to bring the bank's capital
     from the previous regulatory minimum to the new level required by the
     market as the result of the crisis of confidence (the "crisis of
     confidence capital increase").  n14

   The sum of the "market failure loss" and the "crisis of confidence capital
increase" is the amount of aid proportionate to remedy the breakdown in
financial markets. Any aid additional to this amount should be considered
additional aid which the bank can either repay, or--if it cannot be repaid--it
should be the basis on which structural compensatory measures should be
calculated. As a corollary, if the bank can repay this additional aid, then it
should be considered a structurally-sound bank that does not need to
restructure. This is equivalent to saying that a bank is structurally sound if
it had enough surplus capital (in addition to the regulatory minimum) to cover
the fair economic value of its losses.

   A stylized example may help clarify this point. Imagine that before the
crisis a bank had 100 in assets which had a market value of 100, and 100 in
liabilities, of which 17 was in capital, well above the regulatory minimum of 5.
Assume that after September 2008, the assets' market value fell to 70.  n15 The
reasons for this fall in value were two-fold. First, the assets were likely
overpriced to some degree before the crisis; that is, they exceeded their fair
economic value. We might therefore imagine that the fair economic value of the
assets was, in fact, 90. However, the remainder of the fall in the value of the
assets was a reflection of the market failure identified above; namely, that a
"lemons" problem meant that potential purchasers were  [*87]  unable to gauge
the true value of the assets--the market had broken down to some degree--and
assets were undervalued by 20 (this can be considered the "market failure
loss"). In addition, as the result of the systemic crisis of confidence
discussed above, the market was uncertain whether the bank would survive and
thus required it to hold at least 10 in capital (in addition to any capital
necessary to absorb the likely losses), instead of the regulatory minimum of 5.
n16

   Assume that, in order to tackle the crisis, the State provided a
recapitalization of 30. The proposed test would indicate that the amount of aid
proportionate to remedy the breakdown in financial markets would be 25; that is:
(i) the difference between the fair economic value of the assets pre-crisis, 90,
and the market value of the assets during the crisis, 70, plus (ii) the 5 needed
to bring the bank's capital from the previous regulatory minimum to the new
level required by the market, 10, as the result of the crisis of confidence. In
addition, there would be an amount of additional aid equal to 5 (the 30 of aid
granted minus the proportionate tranche of 25).

   In this specific example, the bank still has 17 of capital (as the 30 in
losses were entirely covered by the State aid), which includes 12 of capital
above the regulatory minimum ("surplus capital"). This amount of surplus capital
is enough to cover the fair economic value losses of 10 (that is, the difference
between the pre-crisis market value of the assets, 100, and their fair economic
value, 90). This implies that the bank is structurally sound and it would have
been able to cover its losses and survived in the absence of the market failures
discussed above. Another implication of the bank having enough surplus capital,
and thus being structurally sound, is that it would be able to repay the 5 of
additional aid while maintaining the new minimum capital requirement of 10 (in
fact--with 12 in capital after repaying the additional aid--the bank would even
be above the new regulatory minimum). Thus a structurally sound bank only needed
aid proportionate to remedy the temporary breakdown in financial markets.

   In contrast, we can imagine a different example, in which a bank had only 10
of capital before the crisis--that is, 5 of surplus capital--and thus would not
be able to cover all the fair economic value losses with its surplus capital, or
to repay any of the additional aid. This second bank should not be considered
structurally sound; it should be required to present a restructuring plan, and
compensatory measures should be considered, although limited to the tranche of
additional aid (i.e. 5).

   This approach does not necessarily mean that a structurally sound bank would
be able to repay the entire aid (including the proportionate tranche) once the
[*88]  crisis is over and the market value of the assets rises towards their
"fair value." In fact, the financial crisis, by spilling over to the real
economy and by throwing it into one of the most severe recessions of the last
fifty years, has changed the economic outlook and, thus, the fair economic value
of the assets. This effect should also be ascribed to the market breakdown
and--as we explain in the next section--should not result in a requirement to
consider compensatory measures. To the extent that the market failures addressed
by the aid are temporary in nature, it would be reasonable to expect that the
State should be able to claw-back a certain amount of aid as the market failures
diminish, allowing the value of the assets to climb towards their fair economic
value. As the crisis of confidence eases, banks can go back to more efficient
capital adequacy ratios.

   Note that, for the sake of simplicity, we have assumed that the 30 in aid was
a pure grant, without any form of remuneration or equity participation for the
state. To the extent that some remuneration was received by the state (including
equity participation), the value of this remuneration should be netted out of
the aid, as financing should be considered aid only to the extent that it
exceeded the value of the remuneration or equity participation.

   The upshot of this analysis is much the same as the Commission's position:
Aid rendered necessary by the crisis itself is unproblematic; while aid rendered
necessary by the reckless activities of certain banks must be subject to further
scrutiny. As a result, prudent banks will face fewer, if any, restructuring or
compensatory measures than more reckless banks. But this analysis makes it clear
that the relevant issue is the cause of the aid (to remedy a market failure or
to cover real economic losses), rather than the form or the simple amount of the
aid received--although the higher the amount of aid, the more likely it is that
there is at least some additional aid. A more reckless bank will have received
more additional aid than a less reckless bank, and some more prudent banks will
have received no additional aid.

4. Using the Proportionality Principle to Distinguish Between "Structurally
Sound" and "Structurally Unsound" Banks
The Commission's communications clearly identify the need to distinguish between
banks that are "fundamentally sound" and whose difficulties stem exclusively
from the general market conditions and those banks whose structural solvency
problems are linked to their particular business models or investment
strategies. It should be remembered that the purpose of such a distinction is to
assess how best to respond to State aid measures, rather than to simply identify
profitable and unprofitable banks under current circumstances (although such an
analysis need not be irrelevant). The key is the soundness or otherwise of banks
[*89]  at the point at which State aid was granted, since this sheds light on
the motives of the aid.

   From a policy perspective, it is important that those banks which have
engaged in overly risky investment strategies or that had unsound business
models are not allowed to receive aid without any compensatory measures being
imposed on them. If no compensatory measures were imposed, the aid would create
a significant moral hazard problem and would risk fostering another crisis like
the one we are experiencing. Thus, this approach of differentiating between
banks is--in principle--reasonable. However, the manner in which the Commission
has made this distinction is too simplistic, and does not go to the heart of the
purpose of such an analysis.

   First, it is too simplistic to consider all banks that have received certain
types of aid, a certain amount of aid, or have received aid in different
tranches, as necessarily "unsound," and all others as "sound."  n17 While these
simple screening devices may be useful to identify cases for more in-depth
review, they should not constitute a presumption that the recipient is
structurally unsound and would not have survived, even in the absence of the
widespread market failures which characterized the financial crisis.  n18 It is
important to look more closely at the motives behind the aid and the reasons for
its provision and, in particular, at whether it was justified on the basis of
the market failures that led to the liquidity crisis and the general breakdown
in confidence.

   Second, and more importantly, even if a bank is not "structurally sound," it
does not follow that all the aid given to the bank in question must be
considered distortionary. Rather, some of the aid may very well be justified on
the basis of the general market conditions and of the liquidity crisis, even if
that amount would not have sufficed to maintain the solvency of the bank. Only
the aid above and beyond what was justified on the basis of the breakdown of
financial markets should be considered aid given for the purpose of sustaining a
"structurally unsound" bank, and thus be subject to closer scrutiny.

   The test we propose in this article provides a more analytical approach than
that currently applied by the Commission, and it is very simple:


     "A bank should be considered structurally sound if, at the time of the
     crisis, it had sufficient "surplus capital" (i.e. above the regulatory
     minimum) to  [*90]  absorb all future "fair economic value losses"
     (calculated adopting a scenario in which the financial crisis has not
     considerably affected the real economy and thus the economic outlook).
     If this test is passed, it must mean that a bank would have survived
     absent the market failures which characterized the recent financial
     crisis, and should therefore be considered structurally sound."

   Only banks which did not have enough capital above the regulatory minimum to
cover the fair economic value losses should be considered structurally unsound.
These banks would have received some amount of additional aid and would not be
able to repay it. Therefore, once the additional aid has been identified, the
question must then be asked whether the bank can, or will be able to, repay that
additional aid. If it can, we might consider that aid "erroneously" given, quite
understandably, with a desire to ensure the bank's survival, but to an extent
that actually overestimated that bank's exposure. The bank is still sound, it
would have remained sound were it not for the "serious disturbance," and it
should therefore not be expected to restructure or pay compensatory measures.
There is also no reason not to allow the bank to choose the method of repayment:
from its own resources, from those of debt holders, or from an asset sale on the
open market.

   On the other hand, if a bank did not have enough surplus capital to cover the
fair economic value losses, it would not be in a position to soon repay the
additional aid while remaining viable, and we must therefore consider that the
additional aid was necessary because that bank had invested heavily in risky,
overpriced assets. It should be given the possibility to repay--through its own
choice of method--as much of the additional aid as possible while remaining
viable. Then, as under the R&R guidelines, such a bank should be susceptible to
demands to restructure and/or provide compensatory measures, but only to reflect
the size of the remaining additional aid.

   The reason for the different treatment of these two tranches of aid (the
proportionate aid and the additional aid) lies in the different amount of
distortions that these types of aid are likely to have, as we explain in the
next section.

C. DISTORTIONS OF COMPETITION ARE LIMITED
It cannot be denied that State aid has potentially distortionary effects on the
market, nor that economic efficiency demands that such distortions be minimized.
The Communication points to various potential market distortions arising from
State aid given to the banks: it may reinforce the market position of the aid
recipient relative to that of its unaided competitors; it may help perpetuate
failed business models; it may reduce the incentive to compete; and it may
create moral hazard by encouraging excessive risk taking.

    [*91]  These distortions of competition may result in various types of
market inefficiencies: allocative and productive inefficiencies (as
non-efficient banks are shielded from competition); dynamic inefficiencies (as
incentives to compete are reduced); and risks to financial stability (as the
result of moral hazard).

   It is quite correct for the Commission to be concerned about potential market
distortions caused by State aid; indeed this is the key reason why, in economic
terms, State aid can be problematic. In the Commission's own Common Principles,
distortions of competition (along with effects on trade) are given as the
negative effects of aid which must be weighed against the positive effects in
the Balancing Test. While, in this case, the positive effects of avoiding an
economic catastrophe must be considered to exceed any potential costs, it is not
unreasonable to consider the distortions involved. Furthermore, when considering
the appropriate measures to be taken in response to a finding of additional aid,
the need to minimize distortions should be considered.

   It is useful to distinguish between two main types of distortions of
competition: those arising from moral hazard; and those arising from potential
distortions of competitions in the product market(s).

1. Moral Hazard
In the context of financial markets, moral hazard is often identified as the
most significant distortion that may be generated by the State aid. As several
commentators have put it, there is the possibility that aid could "sow the seeds
of the next crisis."  n19 It is clear that an implicit promise of any aid in
future may affect firms' incentives going forward. In particular, this promise
may result in moral hazard, which arises when a firm or individual is protected
from the "downside" of its risks, incentivizing inefficiently risky behavior. We
believe that such possible moral hazard distortions are the most significant
potential market distortion arising from the aid in this case.

   The tranche of proportionate aid should not give rise to very significant
moral hazard. This is because that aid is exceptional in nature, as it is only
justified on the basis of a very unusual complete breakdown in financial
markets. Thus, proportionate aid will only affect banks' expectations that,
should another complete breakdown in financial markets arise in the future, aid
of a similar magnitude could be granted to banks again. But banks should expect
that, in normal circumstances, only the standard approach to bank restructuring
will be applied. It is not clear why this set of expectations should reduce the
incentives for dynamic competition or increase moral hazard. It is recognized
that the severity of this crisis was exceptional, and that the government
response to the crisis was exceptional as well. Proportionate aid should not
substantially affect the way  [*92]  banks behave in normal market
circumstances, since it would not be seen as a precedent for intervention in
such normal circumstances.

   Banks may still expect that--should they fail in the absence of a complete
breakdown in financial markets--additional aid would be provided to them in
order to avoid the negative externality arising from the interconnected nature
of financial institutions, and this may fuel moral hazard. In fact, the banks
already had these expectations, and it was the realization that such
expectations might be unfounded that made the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers such
a traumatic event for the financial system. Nonetheless, we discuss in section
IV how carefully-considered and appropriate compensatory measures can be used to
minimize the risk of moral hazard from additional aid.

2. Limited Distortions of Productive Efficiency in the Relevant Product Markets
The second type of distortion of competition is the productive inefficiency
arising from allowing inefficient players to survive and to maintain their
market share. In the case of systemic aid under Art. 87(3)(b), this source of
distortion is less important than moral hazard. The aid received by banks, and
especially proportionate aid, does not automatically result in a distortion of
competition. The need for proportionate aid arises from the market failure that
affected all banks; by definition, it is symmetric in nature.

   Unlike normal ad-hoc R&R aid, the entire sector has benefited from government
intervention and aid was generally available to every bank that demanded it, and
thus a level-playing field was largely preserved. This was especially the case
when government intervention took the form of guarantee, asset purchase, or
recapitalization schemes open to all banks operating in a Member State. In many
cases banks were even encouraged to participate in aid schemes, regardless of
their true need to receive it. Schemes open to all banks are, by nature, likely
to be considerably less distortionary than aid reserved to a sub-set of
institutions, who may then be unfairly advantaged in the market.  n20

   Even when recapitalization has been carried out on an ad-hoc basis, it does
not necessarily confer an advantage over competitors, given the strings attached
to the State aid. Banks are often wary of accepting public money if they can
avoid it, as they fear it will open the door to more public scrutiny of their
policies and strategies. Most European banks that were in a position where they
could opt out of the recapitalization and asset purchase schemes chose to do so.
Ten U.S. banks have repaid the aid that they have received under the U.S.
Troubled Asset Relief Program, ("TARP"). This illustrates that those schemes
need not confer a competitive  [*93]  advantage (otherwise all major banks would
choose to participate in the schemes if possible).

   In addition, to the extent that the aid actually remedied a systemic problem
the banks faced--rather than simply being a hand-out--the aid arguably limited
any negative impact on efficiency, in the sense of keeping inefficient firms
alive. By remedying the problems caused by write-downs and a lack of faith in
the financial sector, the aid actually removed some of the inefficiencies which
had rendered it necessary in the first place. In this sense it was not the same
as aid used, for example, to keep alive an inefficient manufacturer, which would
lead to potentially significant productive inefficiencies.

   This is indeed the very nature of aid under Article 87(3)(b): by remedying a
true market failure, rather than "papering over the cracks" of a firm's
failings, it may not create an efficiency imbalance in the market. Thus it is
reasonable to conclude that there are no significant distortions in the relevant
product market( s) associated with proportionate aid under Article 87(3)(b). It
is interesting to note that much of the economics commentary on the banking
crisis has focused on the need to minimize the cost to taxpayers, and the need
to avoid moral hazard and thus a repeat of the crisis, with much less
consideration given to the potential for productive inefficiencies or
distortions of competition between market participants.  n21

   This may be different in the case of additional aid, as--by its nature--it is
aid given to rescue a structurally unsound bank. However, it is clear that, by
preventing the collapse of large interconnected banks, the aid has avoided a
disaster for the European banking sector. Unlike in the usual case of R&R aid ex
Art. 87(3)(c), aid given under 87(3)(b) has an immediate and tangible benefit on
competitors--in this case by preserving the stability of the financial system
and avoiding the domino effect of bank failures.

   The Commission cannot therefore simply assume that the sheer fact that some
banks needed aid while others did not indicates that there was a distortion of
competition in the relevant product markets: a careful and thorough analysis of
the actual distortions of competition needs to be carried out in each case. In
the case of additional aid, the assessment of whether the aid reinforces a
recipient's market power needs to be made by reference to the competitive
conditions in the particular markets in which the recipient is active, and
requires a detailed analysis of: market definition, the recipients' market
positioning and that of their rivals, barriers to entry and expansion, the
presence of any friction in the market, and the degree of rivalry between market
participants. In other words, in light of the externality that  [*94]
interconnected banks impose on each other, a proper analysis needs to be carried
out and distortions of competition in the product market(s) cannot simply be
assumed.

   In conclusion, proportionate aid is unlikely to result in a significant
distortion of competition, but it is possible that some additional aid may
create moral hazard and some distortions of competition in the relevant product
market(s). Given the systemic nature of the crisis and several particular
features of the financial systems, such distortions of competition are likely to
be limited, and primarily related to moral hazard.

D. CONCLUSIONS ON THE BALANCING TEST
There can be little doubt that the positive effects of the aid outweigh the
negative, distortionary effects, given the importance of avoiding a serious
economic catastrophe. Furthermore, a proportion of the aid must be considered to
pass the Balancing Test by being well-designed and proportionate to remedying a
breakdown in financial markets. According to the Commission's own Common
Principles, this implies that that aid should be compatible under Art. 87(3).
There are two corollaries of this conclusion: Compatible aid does not require
compensatory measures (see paragraph 73 of the Common Principles); and
Compatible aid does not need to be repaid, or at least not immediately, as
discussed in more detail in the next section.

   We do however acknowledge--in line with the Commission's thinking on this
issue--that additional aid used to rescue structurally unsound banks should be
treated differently from proportionate aid given to remedy the breakdown in
financial markets. Since additional aid was rendered necessary by the risky
activities of the recipient bank, as opposed to the market failure which
prompted the use of Article 87(3)(b), and to the extent that it is not repaid,
it must be considered that it has more distortionary effects than proportionate
aid. These distortionary effects may be mitigated by certain compensatory
measures.

IV. The Implications for Compensatory Measures
The differences between ad-hoc R&R aid under Art. 87(3)(c) and stabilization aid
under Art. 87(3)(b), as highlighted in the Communication, have important
implications for determining the appropriate compensatory measures.

A. STRUCTURAL COMPENSATORY MEASURES ARE NOT APPROPRIATE IN THE CASE OF
PROPORTIONATE AID
Structural compensatory measures (such as divestments and reductions in
capacity) might have a place in ad-hoc R&R aid ex Art. 87(3)(c) as the rescued
firm should have exited the market as a result of the normal exercise of market
forces and, thus, competitors should be "compensated" for a rival remaining in
the market.  [*95]  Further, all firms must be diverted from the moral hazard
associated with anticipating that they will be "saved." We note--however--that
the Commission's Economic Advisory Group on Competition Policy ("EAGCP") has
recently commented on R&R aid, noting that compensatory measures should serve to
minimize distortions (moral hazard and "competitive externalities"), rather than
being aimed per se at "compensating" competitors.  n22 We agree entirely with
this position.  n23

   Nevertheless, structural compensatory measures are not justified in the case
of proportionate aid under Art. 87(3)(b) where banks would not have failed had
normal market forces continued to operate. This is implicitly recognized by the
Commission in its assessment in the Restructuring Communication that only
certain banks need to engage in "more substantial restructuring," and that such
a measure is designed to "restore viability." There are at least three reasons
why compensatory measures are not justified for proportionate aid under Art.
87(3)(b).

   First, to the extent the Balancing Test has shown that the aid is compatible
with Art. 87(3)(b), the Commission has no justification or power to demand
compensatory measures. Second, even if the Commission had the power to impose
them, compensatory measures might be conceivable only when a bank has benefited
from the aid in a manner which is disproportionate with respect to benefit and
support for the financial sector as a whole, where-as--in this case--the
proportionate aid is common to most banks. Third, even if they were justified,
it is not clear that structural compensatory measures are necessarily consistent
with achieving the goals of the aid under Art. 87(3)(b), as stated at paragraph
2 of the Communication: (i) attain financial stability and maintenance of credit
flows; (ii) limit distortion of competition and effects on trade; and/or (iii)
limit moral hazard and maintain banks' competitiveness.

   If concerns remain about distortions of competition--primarily driven by
moral hazard issues--the fact that proportionate aid was rendered necessary by a
sector-wide market failure leading to a sector-wide crisis means that regulation
and behavioral compensatory measures, rather than mandated asset sales or other
structural compensatory measures, would be most appropriate.

B. COMPENSATORY MEASURES MAY BE JUSTIFIED IN THE CASE OF ADDITIONAL AID BUT MUST
BE DETERMINED CAREFULLY
We have explained that part of the aid granted may constitute additional aid
and, as such, it may have more distortionary effects than proportionate aid. It
may therefore be reasonable to try to minimize the distortionary effects by
imposing some compensatory measures on banks which have received substantial
additional  [*96]  aid, provided that these measures do not endanger the goal of
achieving financial stability by returning banks to viability.

   We emphasize that any such measures should apply only to the additional aid;
a finding of additional aid should not mean that all the aid granted to an
institution becomes susceptible to the same compensatory measures. It would be
unreasonable to treat banks that received very small amounts of additional aid
as harshly as banks that received large amounts of additional aid, even using
the excuse that any level of additional aid means that the financial institution
was kept alive by the aid, and that the market should be brought back to the "no
aid counterfactual" in which the bank would have been liquidated. Consistent
with the EAGCP recommendation, we believe that compensatory measures should only
be undertaken to remedy as much as possible the loss in efficiency that the aid
generated, and thus what is important is not simply the "no aid counterfactual"
but the difference--in terms of departure from economic efficiency--between the
situation generated by the aid and the no aid counterfactual. It is clear that
keeping alive a very inefficient player (which requires large amounts of
additional aid) creates a significantly larger departure from economic
efficiency than keeping alive a marginal player (which requires very small
amounts of additional aid), and thus the latter should be subject to
significantly fewer compensatory measures.

C. ASSET SALES ARE UNLIKELY TO BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE COMPENSATORY MEASURE
While other burden-sharing measures may, to some extent, address moral hazard
(which, we argue, is the most significant potential distortion of competition),
it is difficult to see how compensatory measures involving asset sales can
efficiently achieve this goal.

   Asset sales tend to affect most directly the current shareholders of the
bank. It is reasonable that shareholders bear the brunt of the losses incurred
by banks. However, of all the stakeholders, this group is the one which is
likely to be the least subject to moral hazard, for at least three reasons.
First, asset sales target the current shareholders of a bank, which need not be
the owners who were in place before and during the crisis. Numerous banks
throughout Europe have changed hands in recent months, some now being partially
or entirely state-owned. It is not clear that measures which are felt by those
who did not own the banks while the risky behavior at issue took place will have
a strong effect on moral hazard going forward.  n24

    [*97]  Second, shareholders have suffered significantly as a result of the
crisis,  n25 and while aid may have salvaged some shareholder value, the cost of
such aid has been significant, so it is difficult to see how shareholders would
be prone to significant levels of moral hazard.

   Third, and perhaps more importantly according to many commentators, the most
significant source of moral hazard has not come from distorted incentives for
shareholders, but rather from distorted executive incentives and failings in
bank's governance, which encouraged the pursuit of short-term profits and risk
taking and which existed--and continue to exist--independent of any State aid.
n26 Behavioral compensatory measures that align executives' incentives to the
long-term profitability and viability of banks may be the best solution to the
moral hazard problem, but these need to apply to all banks--sound and unsound,
and regardless of whether they received aid--and thus should be imposed through
sectoral regulation rather than on an ad-hoc basis using State aid law.  n27

   Therefore, asset sales are unlikely to be the best way to tackle moral hazard
while maintaining financial stability. One might take a somewhat different view
of burden sharing which targets debt holders (particularly subordinated debt
holders). Burden sharing may address moral hazard on the part of subordinated
bondholders if the restructuring forces them to convert their bonds into stocks.
Since, in many cases, the aid meant these debt holders kept all of their
investment and continued receiving interest, it is important to consider the
moral hazard they face. To the extent that these debt holders have a direct
influence on banks' behavior, burden sharing to minimize the moral hazard they
face going forward may be justified and effective. As to structural compensatory
measures, the sale of assets would not directly impact debt holders or bank
executive compensation.

   As well as being ineffective in tackling the most significant source of
potential inefficiencies, asset sales may also be damaging to the Commission's
overall goal of financial stability. This is for several reasons. First,
mandatory asset disposals may actually worsen a bank's solvency or future
solvency if there is not a corresponding reduction in liabilities, assets are
sold below book value, or the sales price is materially below the value of
foregone earnings. Achieving the right balance between a combined disposal of
assets and liabilities and ensuring the bank's solvency and viability is very
difficult. In the current market circumstances, banks would most likely have to
divest their most profitable assets, which would reduce the bank's ability to be
viable and improve its solvency by retaining earnings. The result of assets
sales would thus likely run counter to the aid's objectives.

   A particular problem from the point of view of the bank sector is
that--unlike any other sector--competitors can take on the divested assets only
if they can  [*98]  raise a corresponding amount of capital to maintain their
capital adequacy ratios at a prudent level (which at the moment is above the
minimum regulatory level). This tends to reduce the ability of competitors to
take on divested assets, and thus to be "compensated." This is particularly
important given that many banks suffer from re-ratings of their Risk Weighted
Assets due to more prudent risk management policies, deteriorating asset prices,
and the wave of downgrades of bonds by rating agencies. An added complication of
compensatory measures during a systemic crisis is that there are many sellers
and few buyers, so it may be difficult to sell a significant portion of assets
without depressing their prices to a point which might create another financial
crisis.

   Another distortion of competition typical of the usual R&R aid ex Art.
87(3)(c) is that State aid may sustain the recipient's output and this may
displace ("crowd out") the output that would have been provided by the
recipient's competitors. For aid under Art. 87(3)(b) to have a "crowding out"
effect, it must be the case that the aid recipient's rivals have the capacity
and the willingness to increase lending. These conditions are not met in much of
the European financial sector, as the credit contraction has limited banks'
ability to lend. Wholesale funding markets still do not allow refinancing of
long term wholesale funding and banks therefore need to rely heavily on the
European Central Bank ("ECB") for their liquidity. This is likely to make asset
sales even more difficult and closer to fire sales.

   Perhaps more importantly, given the market constraints on the absorption of
divested assets, it is very likely that compensatory measures will result in a
reduction in the level of the assets available in the market overall. As assets
constitute, for the most part, short and long-term loans provided by the banking
sector to the economy, this would have exacerbated the monetary contraction
which is already very serious, potentially damaging the opportunity of recovery
in the real economy.

V. Conclusions
In conclusion, while we think that some behavioral compensatory measures can be
efficiently imposed on banks that received aid under Art. 87(3)(b), structural
compensatory measures should only be considered with regard to the tranche of
the additional aid; that is, that aid that was above and beyond what was
necessary to remedy the effects of the market failures that lead to a breakdown
of financial markets ("the proportionate aid").

    [*99]  Even in this case, other burden-sharing measures and measures
focusing on governance and executive pay may be more efficient than asset sales
in addressing the main distortionary effect of the aid: moral hazard. Finally,
asset sales risk undermining the key goal of the aid granted under Art.
87(3)(b)--returning banks to viability and stabilizing the financial system--so
they should only be imposed only when there is compelling evidence of
distortions of competition in the product market(s).

n5  For a discussion of the uniqueness of the financial sector and its
implications for State aid policy, see Bruce Lyons, Competition Policy, Bailouts
and the Economic Crisis, CCP Working Paper 09-4, 2009.





n6  Another source of uniqueness of the financial sector is that banks have
inherently unstable balances sheets with long-term assets (loans and
investments) and short-term liabilities (deposits), which make them particularly
vulnerable to crises of confidence.





n7  "The general erosion of confidence within the banking sector in October 2008
led to serious difficulties in accessing liquidity. The crisis had become
systemic and equally affected financial institutions whose difficulties stemmed
exclusively from general market conditions severely restricting access to
liquidity. It thus became doubtful whether the R&R Guidelines were still
providing an appropriate framework to tackle the crisis, as the crisis also hit
banks that could normally not be considered "companies in difficulties."
Furthermore, urgent structural action became necessary in many cases." Spring
2009 update of the State Aid Scoreboard, page 8.





n8  This framework is rarely applied; it is significant that there is no body of
case law defining the relevant criteria to be applied under Art. 87(3)(b).





n9  [FOOTNOTE REFERENCE MISSING IN ORIGINAL] A market failure is a situation in
which the market alone fails to provide the optimal level of a good or service
(that is, a Pareto efficient solution). The concept of market failure is linked
to the first fundamental theorem of welfare economics. The market fails to
deliver an efficient outcome whenever there are incomplete markets, asymmetric
information, coordination failures, consumers and producers do not behave
competitively, and/or no equilibrium exists. In these circumstances all economic
actors can, in principle, be made better off by removing the market failure,
possibly through the use of state aid. For a definition of market failure, see
John O. Ledyard, Market failure, THE NEW PALGRAVE DICTIONARY OF ECONOMICS, 2nd
Ed., Steven N. Durlauf & Lawrence E. Blume eds., (2008).

n13  We understand that financial institutions need to perform credit analyses
of credit related assets which are subsequently audited. These audited figures
can be used to determine the true economic value of these assets.





n14  Note that this amount should only consider the amount of extra capital that
the market requires financial institutions to have as a result of the crisis of
confidence discussed above, and should therefore exclude: (i) the additional
capital necessary to cover the likely write-downs that can be expected as a
result of the analysis in the previous points (both the fair economic value and
the market failure losses); and (ii) any non-transitory increase in capital
adequacy requirements in recognition of the fact that previous regulatory
requirements were inappropriate, as any increase in capital required for these
reasons should not be considered as having been caused by a market failure.





n15  Note that we are assuming that the full amount of this revaluation directly
affects regulatory capital.





n16  Note that in this stylized example the increase in the minimum capital from
5 to 10 is the net of two effects: (i) the increase in the minimum capital
adequacy ratio as a result of the crisis of confidence, and (ii) the reduction
in the Risk Weighted Asset base as the result of the 30 losses, which tends to
reduce the amount of necessary capital. Note also that--in this stylized
example--we abstract from the fact that the book value of the capital may be
different from its market value. We also assume that the "normal" regulatory
minimum remains at 5: i.e. none of the increase from 5 to 10 can be considered a
non-transitory increase in regulatory requirements as a result of a permanent
change in regulatory policy.





n17  The Commission explicitly mentions that institutions which have received a
certain amount of aid, and institutions which have received asset relief in
additional to some other aid, will be susceptible to restructuring demands. For
example, see footnote 4 of the Restructuring Communication: "The criteria and
specific circumstances which trigger the obligation to present a restructuring
plan have been explained in the Banking Communication, the Recapitalisation
Communication and the Impaired Assets Communication. They refer in particular,
but not exclusively, to situations where a distressed bank has been
recapitalised by the State, or when the bank benefiting from asset relief has
already received State aid in whatever form that contributes to coverage or
avoidance of losses (except participation in a guarantee scheme) which
altogether exceeds 2% of the total bank's risk weighted assets. The degree of
restructuring will depend on the seriousness of problems of each bank." Also
note paragraph 55 of the Impaired Assets Communication: "In-depth restructuring
would also be required where the bank has already received State aid in whatever
form that either contributes to coverage or avoidance of losses, or altogether
exceeds 2% of the total bank's risk weighted assets, while taking the specific
features of the situation of each beneficiary in due consideration."





n18  The Commission does not seem to take into consideration even relatively
simple qualitative indicators of whether a bank was structurally sound, such as:
absence of interventions or warnings by the financial regulators; absence of
history of aid measures in the past; absence of indications from analysts and
rating agencies that there would be anything wrong or particularly risky in a
bank's strategy; and/or share price or traded debt movements indicating an early
loss of confidence by investors. Although these qualitative indicators are
imperfect and an analysis based on them would not be as rigorous as the approach
outlined in this article, they would certainly provide a better measure of an
institution's viability than the simplistic approach which the Commission seems
intent on applying based on the form and amount of aid received.





n19  For example, see Luigi Zingales, Yes We Can, Secretary Geithner,
ECONOMISTS' VOICE, (February 2009). Also see Thomas F. Cooley, Moral Hazard on
Steroids, FORBES, (March 2009).





n20  Or, as John Vickers put it when writing about the October 8 U.K. scheme:
"Given that the crisis is systemic and one of inadequate capital, not just
insufficient liquidity, schemes on the lines of the U.K. plan announced of
October 8 make good economic sense. While state bailouts of arguably insolvent
institutions are deeply unattractive, the realistic alternatives were still
worse. The scheme is broadly competitively-neutral among U.K. institutions, and
positive for other countries, many of whom have emulated the package. So while
it is surely state aid, it is not seriously competition-distorting aid." John
Vickers, The financial crisis and competition policy: some economics, GCP
MAGAZINE, (Dec-08), available at www.globalcompetitionpolicy.org.





n21  See, for instance, Jeremy Bulow & Paul Klemperer, Reorganising the Banks:
Focus on the Liabilities, Not the Assets, ECONOMISTS' VOICE (March 2009); and
Zingales, supra note 19. Also see Douglas Diamond, Steve Kaplan, Anil Kashyap,
Raghuram Rajan, & Richard Thailer, Fixing the Paulson Plan, WALL STREET J,
(September 26, 2008); and June 2009 comments by former Bank of England Deputy
Governor John Gieve, reported at
http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601085&sid=a.sawnjO6kws.





n22  See pp. 9 & 10 of the EAGCP Commentary on European Community Rescue and
Restructuring Aid Guidelines, (February 2008).





n23  This position also seems to be supported within the Commission. Georges
Siotis, of the Chief Economist Team, noted that:


     . "For non-financial institutions, compensatory measures typically
     consist of asset disposals and/or capacity reductions that
     "compensate" competitors for the survival of the distressed firm.
     . For financial institutions, the disappearance or downsizing of a
     bank may actually hurt competitors"


See slide 18 of Georges Siotis, The current financial crisis and EU Competition
Policies, at the ECRI/DIW/CEPS Conference, June 10, 2009 (available at
http://www.ecri.eu/new/system/files/Siotis_2009-06-10.pdf).





n24  In the case of banks in which the State is now a significant shareholder,
compensatory measures may result in a "double-whammy" for tax payers: they had
to bail-out banks and now they have to face a drop in the value of their
"investment" as the result of asset sales.





n25  For example, shares in RBS lost around 80 percent of their value over the
12 months to July 2009. AIG shares lost around 98 percent of their value in the
same period.





n26  See, for instance, Marco Becht, who highlights how the current crisis has
"brought to light classic examples of board failure on strategy and oversight,
misaligned or perverse incentives, empire building, conflicts of interest,
weaknesses in internal controls, incompetence, and fraud." Marco Becht,
Corporate Governance and the Credit Crisis, MACROECONOMIC STABILITY AND
FINANCIAL REGULATION: KEY ISSUES FOR THE G20, Mathias Dewatripont, Xavier
Freixas, &Richard Portes eds. CEPR, (2009).





n27  It should be considered that a bank cannot unilaterally change its
executive pay structure without incurring heavy costs in terms of lost talent.
While it would be to the advantage of all bank shareholders to do so, there may
be a coordination failure preventing imposing different incentive structures on
the management. Regulation would be necessary to impose this more efficient
incentive structure.

After 30 years as Managing Director of some of the UK's largest hearing aid
firms, Mark Moss knows what hearing aids should really cost. He also knows that
if you buy a cheap hearing aid without the proper advice and after-care - you
could find the aid is not so cheap after all. That's why he has now produced a

The fact is many people who suffer from hearing loss are reluctant to attempt to
buy a hearing aid because they find the whole process confusing and are not sure
where to find truly independent advice and the best prices.

Trustworthy Advice This is unfortunate because there are many professional
independent hearing aid dispensers who take great care and pride in providing
the latest hearing solutions for your individual needs. However, one national

How effective is Australia's foreign aid?

BYLINE: Simon Feeny

SECTION: A; Pg. 13

LENGTH: 629  words


LAST September, the Howard Government pledged to double Australia's foreign aid
budget by 2010. For some this announcement was met with great enthusiasm.
Increasing the level of foreign aid is widely viewed as necessary in order to
achieve the United Nations Millennium Development Goals by 2015 -
internationally agreed targets to improve well-being in developing countries.

Others welcomed the announcement but argued that the increase does not go far
enough - much more foreign aid is needed if the goals are to be achieved. But
others argue that the increases in foreign aid will not benefit recipient
countries and that aid is actually harmful. Such critics believe that foreign
aid is wasted on unproductive activities and prevents necessary policy reforms.

These negative perceptions have often appeared in the Australian press with
regard to aid effectiveness in the Pacific and have largely gone unchallenged.
Debates are likely to be re-invigorated soon with the welcome release of a
forthcoming White Paper on the future of Australia's aid program. So what do we
really know about the effectiveness of foreign aid?

There is now an extensive body of recent international research which has
examined the impact of foreign aid. The consensus of this research is that
foreign aid works. That is, foreign aid is effective at spurring economic growth
and therefore poverty reduction in recipient countries. The implication is that
economic growth would be lower in the absence of foreign aid.

Importantly, this large body of international research includes studies
examining foreign aid effectiveness in the Pacific where most of Australia's aid
is provided. The association between poor growth rates and high levels of
foreign aid in the Pacific is not therefore, evidence to conclude that aid has
been ineffective.

Research indicates that in the poorly performing economies of Melanesia,
economic growth rates would have been 3 per cent lower in the absence of foreign
aid during the last two decades. But it is also true that aid alone is not
enough to eradicate poverty in recipient countries. Foreign aid is just one of
many factors that can assist with poverty reduction. Responsibility largely
rests with recipient governments but the international community can still play
an important role through the provision of foreign aid and reducing barriers to
trade.

Recent research into foreign aid has provided us with many important insights
into its effectiveness. However, some aspects warrant further attention. Some
research suggests that are reasons to be cautious in providing very large
amounts of aid to developing countries.

Precise estimates of how much is too much will become a more pertinent issue
with the scaling up of aid. Further analysis is also needed on how aid can most
effectively improve governance in recipient countries.

This is particularly important for Australia since the aid program in the
Pacific focuses on improving governance as a means for sustained economic growth
and poverty reduction. The Pacific region presents a considerable development
challenge. Pacific countries are characterised by political instability, large
inefficient public sectors, large informal sectors, ethnic tensions and a
vulnerability to natural disasters. Development is further constrained by their
geographic location, and the small size of their domestic markets. Without
assistance offered from Australia and other countries the prospects for some
Pacific countries are bleak. Recent pledges to increase aid are very
encouraging. An informed debate focused on maximising aid effectiveness in such
a challenging environment is now required.

NGOs show the way in providing aid that counts

BYLINE: Alan Mitchell

SECTION: MARKET WRAP; Economic Briefing; Pg. 24

LENGTH: 761 words


A new study finds that aid by NGOs is achieving measurable results on the
ground, writes economics editor Alan Mitchell.

If you want to bring a right-wing think tank quickly to the boil, just mention
the words foreign aid and non-governmental organisations. Not that foreign aid
or NGOs have a very high reputation among economists generally. The
effectiveness of foreign aid is an unresolved issue. In the late 1990s,
researchers at the World Bank found that aid had a positive impact on growth in
developing countries with good fiscal, monetary and trade policies. These
results appear to have had an important influence on the design of the Bush
administration's $US5 billion Millennium Challenge aid program. But,
unfortunately, the World Bank's conclusions have since been undermined by more
recent data.

The performance of NGOs compared with official aid channels is also difficult to
measure. NGOs provide important assistance often where official aid is
unavailable (in rebel-controlled areas, for example). But when NGOs campaign
against free trade, oppose the use of insecticides and resist new technology
they are accused by economists of exacerbating poverty.

But research just published by the International Monetary Fund sheds some new
light on this old debate. The authors of the research are Boriana Yontcheva of
the IMF and Nadia Masud, a PhD student from Oxford University.

Their objective was to quantify the effectiveness of foreign aid in reducing
poverty, as measured by changes in the United Nations' human development
indicators. Human development indicators are used by the UN for its annual human
development report. They attempt to measure outcomes such as life expectancy at
birth, under-five mortality rates, literacy rates and so on.

Yontcheva and Masud also measure the impact of two kinds of foreign aid:
official bilateral aid and aid projects led by international NGOs. As far as the
authors know, this is the first study of the effectiveness of NGO aid at the
macro level.

A separate assessment of the effectiveness of NGO aid is interesting for at
least two reasons: NGOs have grown in importance, and they work differently to
government agencies.

In setting their priorities, NGOs should be more concerned than donor
governments with need and less influenced by strategic considerations. NGOs also
distribute their aid directly at the grassroots level and not through the
governments of recipient countries. In theory, therefore, they should avoid the
problems of misallocation (aid going to the wrong countries for strategic
reasons) and misuse (recipient governments using aid money for non-aid
purposes).

Yontcheva and Masud have chosen two human development indicators for their
study: infant mortality and adult illiteracy. That is partly because health and
education indicators are more concrete measures than other, more general
measures of poverty. But there is also evidence that infant mortality responds
quickly to improvements in health services and can therefore be considered a
"flash indicator" of improvement in the conditions of the poor.

Now for the bottom line. The findings of Yontcheva and Masud are more flattering
to NGOs than to official aid.

First, they find that NGO aid per capita is above average for countries with
above-average infant mortality and adult illiteracy. The opposite is true of
official bilateral aid.

Second, increased per capita NGO aid does appear to achieve a small improvement
in infant mortality, whereas bilateral aid has no impact.

There was no evidence of either NGO or bilateral aid reducing the level of adult
illiteracy, but the authors warn that the time period covered by the data may be
too short to pick up the impact.

Neither bilateral aid nor NGO aid has any impact on the share of government
spending on health care. In the case of official aid, that may suggest that the
aid effort is being misused. Recipient governments may be using the foreign aid
as an opportunity to reduce their own health-care efforts.

On the other hand, the fact that NGO aid has no discernible effect on government
health-care spending is a good sign. It suggests that the NGO aid may increase
the total resources available to poverty reduction.

This study will not settle the big arguments. For example, NGOs may be better at
providing help to those in need, but donor governments may be better at
engineering cures for Third World poverty by pressuring Third World governments
to reform their policies.

But it highlights important strengths of NGOs, which official aid agencies can
both utilise and imitate.

AIDS

BYLINE: CLARK G

DID you know that changes in mental health could easily be the first indication
of an AIDS infection? Or that people with advanced AIDS are more liable to
transmit tuberculosis and various gut infections than AIDS itself? These are two
of the little-known facts revealed through The Courier-Mail's question and
answer phone-in over three hours yesterday. More than 250 questions came from
readers, covering everything from the dangers of mosquitoes to the politics of
educating children in schools about AIDS. The survey comes at the eve of the
launch of the National Advisory Council on AIDS (NACAIDS) national AIDS
awareness campaign, starting on April 1. Twenty-seven questions based on the
phone-in were put to the Deputy Director-General of Health and AIDS Task Force
member, Dr Ken Donald. Here are his replies: 1. Can you get AIDS from
mosquitoes, flies, ants or other insects? No. Any disease transported by an
insect has to be able to live and breed inside that insect. AIDS is not adapted
to do that. Diseases like malaria and Ross River virus are adapted to be carried
via mosquitoes, but infections like the common cold and measles are not. In
practice, there is no evidence from major studies worldwide of mosquitoes
transmitting AIDS. The chance of infected blood being carried outside the
insect's proboscis is so unlikely as not to be a practical problem. On average,
three drops of blood are needed to carry enough of the virus to be effective,
but no mosquito would get off the ground with that much blood on its proboscis.
2. What are the AIDS stages, symptoms and how long do they take to appear? From
the time of AIDS infection, a minimum of 50 percent of people, and probably the
great majority will get fatal complications. The speed with which they develop
AIDS symptoms can vary from six months to many years. It appears the majority
will suffer fatal complications with AIDS between five and up to 10 or 20 years
later. The symptoms are non-specific and can include loss of weight, loss of
appetite, diarrhoea, night sweats, general illness, culminating in attacks of
pneumonia and other infections which do not respond to treatment. Cancer and
dementia are other manifestations of AIDS, and medical authorities worldwide say
that mental disorders are frequently one of the early signs. It has reached the
stage where differential diagnosis of any mental disturbance must now include
AIDS. 3. Can you get AIDS from acupuncture needles, ear piercing, tattooing,
barbers' razors, communal use of cups, glasses, sharing cigarettes or drinks?
Needles, acupuncture, tattoos and razors: it's theoretically possible to get
AIDS but the amount of blood transmitted by these things is so small, it's
unlikely. There are regulations in Queensland which control the use of these
items, so that the customer gets a new instrument or a sterilised one. Glasses
and cups and sharing cigarettes and drinks are not a risk. The virus does not
spread by the oral route and is destroyed by stomach gastric juices. 4. Can you
get AIDS from someone with the virus just by being in the same place as them, or
from breathing in their breath? No. 5. How can my teenage daughter obtain advice
about avoiding AIDS? Phone numbers, publications? The disease is spread by
sexual activity and sharing the needles of drug addicts. Blood is sucked into a
syringe by one addict and often significant quantities are injected into the arm
of the next intravenous drug user. The Health Department's Division of Health
Promotion prints an explanatory leaflet about AIDS and the Queensland AIDS
Council has a number of trained counsellors to give advice: telephone 8541758.
6. Can you get AIDS from kissing? In practice, AIDS is not transferred by
kissing. The reason why it does not happen is that to promote AIDS, large
amounts of saliva would need to enter the blood stream. This in fact doesn't
happen because the saliva mainly goes into the stomach. 7. Will there be AIDS
education provided by the Queensland Government in schools and to at-risk
community groups? The Health Department has provided pamphlets about AIDS for
Queensland State schools, and AIDS advice for the after-hours curriculum
development.tion curriculum which is currently in place. For at-risk groups and
homosexuals in particular, information is available from the Queensland AIDS
Council. For other at-risk groups, including promiscuous heterosexuals, the
Government has published pamphlets, although the most important source of
accurate AIDS information is the various print and electronic media. The
Education Department stated: AIDS is covered in the eight to 10-year-old's
curriculum through citizenship education, health and physical education, and
home economics, science and study of society. Children aged 11 and 12 receive
education in AIDS in subjects such as biological science, health and physical
education, and the home economics, science and study of society course. AIDS is
also included in the after-hours personal development program.

Are we killing with kindness or wise to be lending a helping hand?

BYLINE: Nigel Grimwade

SECTION: BOOKS; Pg. 22  No. 1804

LENGTH: 993 words


What have we to show for 50 years of aid-giving by rich to poor countries? Have
they resulted in any discernible improvement in the conditions of the world's
poor or has the money largely gone to waste? Worse still, might aid have
actually harmed these countries, resulting in a worse economic performance, as
some critics have argued? What, if anything, can be done to make aid work
better?

These issues are examined and discussed in these two books, both by well- known
authors who are concerned with the problem of global poverty and have a
considerable knowledge of the subject matter. The books' publication is timely,
given the renewed interest in the subject of aid in recent years. The "Make
Poverty History" campaign, the adoption of the United Nations Millennium
Development Goals and the commitment of world leaders to increase aid levels at
the Gleneagles Summit in 2005 have given a new prominence to the topic. Both
authors are, broadly speaking, aid optimists in that they believe that aid can
play an effective role in reducing world poverty and helping the poorest
countries improve their economic performance. However, both argue that a lot
needs to be done to make aid work better. The books are very different. Does
Foreign Aid Really Work? is a treatise on the subject, written by an author
whose earlier Foreign Aid Reconsidered was essential reading for any student of
development economics two decades ago. Roger Riddell is one of the world's
leading authorities on the subject. He has taught, written, published and spoken
on it for more than 30 years and has directed one of the leading charities
involved in aid-giving. His book contains everything anyone might want to know
about the subject. Above all, his book sets out what we do and still do not know
about the impact that aid has on the countries that receive it. What emerges
from a reading of the book is the sheer complexity of the topic and the great
difficulty of determining whether or not giving aid has a positive impact.
First, aid is given by a large number of different donors, which includes
governments, multilateral aid institutions and, of increasing importance, a
multitude of different non-governmental organisations. Some of this comes in the
form of aid projects, some in the form of particular programmes and the rest as
technical assistance or capacity building. Second, the data required to assess
aid and measure its impact often do not exist in the required form. Third, there
is the difficulty of agreeing on the aims and purpose of aid and, therefore, the
criteria against which performance should be measured. Fourth, there is the
problem of the appropriate time horizon over which to judge the outcome. Last,
but not least, there is the problem of determining what would have happened if
aid had not been given - the counter-factual problem. Perhaps not surprisingly,
Riddell is sceptical over any bold claims about the effectiveness of aid one way
or the other. Much research has been carried out, but the results are mixed.
Perhaps more valuable than learning what works is discovering what does not
work. This is to be expected as there are so many factors that affect the
outcome of aid given. Therefore, Riddell wants to turn the question around,
asking what can be done to make aid more effective. Five problems need to be
addressed, he argues: the amount of aid given; the rational and efficient
allocation of aid; stable flows of aid; eliminating overlap, duplication and
inconsistency arising from the multitude of different bodies giving aid; and
addressing the imbalance in the donor-recipient relationship that leaves
recipients as the junior partner. Much is already being done to address some of
these issues. What matters is their cumulative impact. By way of contrast,
Making Aid Work is a short book, consisting of a series of contributions by
different academics and practitioners. Like Riddell, the lead author, Abhijit
Vinayak Banerjee, professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, is an aid optimist, who thinks that aid can be made to work.
However, what is needed is an improvement in the method of giving aid. Banerjee
blames "institutional laziness" - aid institutions fail to make the effort to
find out what forms of aid work before they give it. He cites the example of a
recent publication of the World Bank that contained a long list of best-practice
measures for reducing poverty, without providing any evidence that they work.
Research to find out what does work suffers from the difficulty that we cannot
know whether or not what we observe to be taking place is the result of the
measures introduced. Banerjee's solution is to borrow from medical research the
practice of carrying out randomised trials before giving aid and fund only
projects that are proven to work. He gives the example of randomised evaluations
to find the cheapest way of getting children to spend more time in school. This
turned out to be giving children deworming medicine so that they were sick less
often. Choosing the right option can matter a great deal in ensuring that scarce
aid money is not wasted on expensive, ineffectual projects. As several of the
other contributors show, there are practical problems in carrying this approach
too far. However, Banerjee is surely right to argue for a more scientific
approach to aid giving and the selection of suitable projects for funding. Here
are two books that are essential reading for anyone interested in the subject of
aid and wishing to be informed about the issues involved. At a time when
politicians are being urged to match actions with words by increasing levels of
aid giving, it is vitally important that we stand back and ask how we can make
the funds currently available achieve much better results. Making aid more
effective matters as much as giving more. Nigel Grimwade is principal lecturer

House approves additional money for public schools

Mar. 23--DENVER - The Colorado House gave preliminary approval Wednesday to a
measure that puts $164 million more into the state's schools.

Lawmakers said they were able to put more money into the annual School Finance
Act because of Referendum C, the ballot question voters approved in November to
turn over their tax refunds under the Taxpayers Bill of Rights to help the state
recover from the recent recession.

HB1375, the measure that determines how much in per-pupil funding each of the
state's 178 school districts, increases per-pupil funding by $209 a student.

As a result, the 50 school districts in Southern Colorado will see about $12.6
million more than they did last year.

Overall, Pueblo District 60 will receive about $83 million next school year, an
increase of about $3.3 million. Pueblo County District 70 will get nearly $36
million, about $2.3 million more than it received this year.

Other school districts in the region will get a combined $168 million, though
two districts will see fewer dollars because of declining enrollment.

In Saguache County, Mountain Valley schools had a 7 percent decline in
enrollment, which will receive about $12,000 less than it did this year.

In Baca County, the five fewer students who are expected to attend Campo schools
next year will take a $24,151 bite out of the district's state aid.

In separate efforts, Reps. Buffie McFadyen, D-Pueblo West, and Cory Gardner,
R-Yuma, tried to get more money for rural schools. The rest of the House,
however, voted them down.

"Many of these districts in rural areas have huge transportation costs,"
McFadyen said in presenting her proposed change. "I'm trying to help many school
districts around the state that historically have been unrepresented in funding.
They will still be at the bottom of the funding list, this just gets them a
little closer to the middle."

Her amendment would have brought $557,247 more dollars to the poorest schools in
Southern Colorado, including about $172,000 to District 70.

While McFadyen tried to help those school districts that received the fewest
state dollars, Gardner's proposed change would have given rural schools, mostly
those in the Eastern Plains, additional money to compensate them for declining
enrollments.

In the end, though, the House made virtually no changes that affected the
overall per-pupil funding amount.

The House is expected to formally vote on the measure today before sending it
off to the Senate for more debate.

AIDS on the Job: Businesses Fight Fears and Prejudices

BYLINE: By LINDA SASLOW

SECTION: Section 12LI; Page 1, Column 1; Long Island Weekly Desk

LENGTH: 2044 words


ALTHOUGH the rising number of AIDS cases on Long Island has prompted concern
among businesses, its impact in the workplace is hard to gauge because of the
continuing stigma attached to AIDS and the reluctance of most affected employees
to admit that they have the dreaded virus.

There is nothing to gain by admitting to having AIDS, said one former high
school teacher (he did not want to be identified), who has been on disability
since July.

''Once I found out that I was HIV positive and began to develop symptoms
associated with ARC - a rash, diarrhea, exhaustion - I carefully didn't tell the
school what was wrong,'' he said.

''It was for my own self-protection and theirs; if it got around to the parents,
the whole community would have been up in arms.''

When the former teacher's colleagues realized that something was wrong, he said,
they thought he had cancer and were very kind and supportive.

''There would have been no benefit in disclosing the truth,'' he said. ''I would
advise anyone with AIDS who is still working to be as tactful as possible.''

''Anybody with the AIDS virus would be an idiot to tell his employer, unless he
has a good reason to,'' said Susan Noseda, an AIDS home-care coordinator who
works out of the Nassau County Medical Center in East Meadow.

''Not only does he face ostracism from fellow employees, but there also is the
potential to lose all sorts of benefits that he has worked hard for. AIDS,
unfortunately, is a disease of behavior.''

One employee at a Long Island medical laboratory who has AIDS said that he had
experienced firsthand the ''silent plague.'' When it was first discovered,
albeit accidentally, that he had AIDS, nobody wanted to talk about it, the
employee said.

However, after several co-workers told their employer that they did not want to
work with him, he was quietly moved to a different shift and everyone pretended
it was a promotion, he said.

Some people in the workplace know that the man has AIDS, but they deny it and it
is not discussed. There is a lot of fear among employees, he said, but no AIDS
education is provided for them.

The irrational fears that have been created will take a long time to dispel,
said an ex-addict who, during treatment in a drug program on Long Island, was
diagnosed as having AIDS.

''People are in the grip of fear and they don't want to bring up the subject,''
he said. ''Because of the lack of information and support, many people with AIDS
are shunned and will die unnecessarily.''

There have been about 850 documented cases of AIDS on Long Island, according to
the state's Department of Health. This number does not include individuals with
ARC (AIDS-related complex), HIV antibody positive or those who have been
diagnosed elsewhere and have returned to Long Island.

Projections by the Nassau-Suffolk Health Systems Agency indicate that by 1991
there will be 2,700 AIDS cases on Long Island.

Although there are employees in the Long Island workplace who have AIDS or HIV,
most businesses still deny that AIDS is a problem on the Island and resist
offering aggressive education, said Jonathan Silin, director of education for
the Long Island Association for AIDS Care.

''If people don't get on the stick and do aggressive education,'' he said, ''
AIDS in the workplace will become a crisis.''

Mr. Silin was among the speakers at ''AIDS in the Workplace,'' a seminar held
under the sponsorship of the Small Business Council of the Long Island
Association. About 20 managers and employers discussed critical issues of
concern in the workplace.

Many Long Island companies acknowledge that AIDS is a concern in the workplace
and that they may, in fact, have employees with AIDS. But there is usually no
confirmation of AIDS until the employees are no longer working; in many cases,
they have died.

In some of Long Island's largest companies, including Long Island Lighting and
New York Telephone, no information is available on the number of employees with
AIDS and no corporate policy is in place or being planned to deal with affected
employees.

Other companies have taken a more open and aggressive approach to the issue of
AIDS in the workplace.

Since 1986, Grumman has been offering lecture series, videos and seminars to
supervisors and employees in the personnel, medical, legal and security
departments.

There have been eight known cases of AIDS at Grumman since 1985, said John
Brody, the company's manager of health services. Five of the individuals have
since died, but confirmation of AIDS was not made until after their death.

One individual with AIDS is currently on disability by choice, and the two
others are still working.

Of the two still working, Mr. Brody said, one requested confidentiality, but the
other gave his consent for education and counseling to be provided in his
department.

''Initially, there was panic within the department,'' Mr. Brody said. ''But once
we went in and got people to understand that in an everyday situation there is
no risk, things calmed down.''

Most of those who attended the seminar said that, although no one at their
companies had AIDS, they realized that they must be ahead of the problem and
needed to formulate plans.

At Underwriters Laboratories in Melville, which has 850 employees, an AIDS
policy is part of a larger one on infectious diseases and handicaps.

The policy, said Heinz Rosen, executive staff engineer, outlines both the rights
and obligations of the afflicted, their fellow employees and the employers.

''There is a recognition among employees that efforts are being made by
management to address important issues and to do something about them,'' Mr.
Rosen said.

''We don't have a policy yet, but are in the process of revamping our
handbook,'' said Arthur Goebel, director of human resources at the Servo
Corporation in Hicksville, which employs about 300 people.

''We want to take a pro-active approach, to bring AIDS into focus from a
medical, legal and human standpoint, and to create a positive atmosphere within
the company,'' Mr. Goebel said.

A company's biggest asset is its employees, said Judy McEvoy, director of the
Small Business Council. Aside from profit-making, she said, there are other
factors that affect the running of a business.

''We can't stick our heads in the sand,'' Ms. McEvoy said. ''We must address
these problems.''

''The projections of the number of AIDS victims are frightening, especially now
that medication for AIDS tends to prolong life,'' said Mark Sussman of the
Woodbury law firm of Jackson, Lewis, Schnitzler & Krupman, who also spoke at the
seminar. (The firm specializes in labor and employment.) ''It only stands to
reason that there will be more employees with AIDS in the work force,'' Mr.
Sussman said.

Although employers may want to bury their heads in the sand, he said, they must
deal with both AIDS workers and fellow employees who object to working with AIDS
individuals. There must be a legal and practical process for companies to deal
with issues of AIDS, he said.

Employment issues concerning AIDS center upon the rights of the AIDS-afflicted
employee and the rights of co-workers, Mr. Sussman said. At times, he said,
these rights conflict and place the employer in a ''Catch-22'' situation.

New York State law prohibits discrimination in employment on the basis of
physical, mental or medical impairment; under the New York State human rights
law, AIDS is considered a disability.

An individual with AIDS is classified as handicapped and, therefore, protected
under antidiscrimination laws, provided the impairment does not prevent the
individual from substantially performing the job sought or held.

The key, Mr. Sussman said, is that the employee must be able to do his job. The
law, he said, requires that an employer reasonably accommodate the handicapped,
so long as the employer does not suffer undue hardship.

Only if the handicap substantially interferes with the person's ability to
perform the job, or if the handicap poses a reasonable probability of harm to
others, can an employer lawfully justify employment actions, Mr. Sussman said.

When it becomes known that an employee is afflicted with AIDS, co-workers may
refuse to work with the employee, Mr. Sussman said.

The National Labor Relations Act protects group action to protest a health or
safety hazard, and these co-workers cannot be dismissed for refusing to work
with an employee who has AIDS, Mr. Sussman said.

However, if their refusal to work hinders business, they can be replaced and the
employer can proceed as if the employees were on strike.

Employers must be aware of the legal aspects of individuals with AIDS, Mr.
Sussman said. Cases concerning AIDS as a protected handicap are just now
reaching the courts.

''What it really comes down to is an educational process for both employers and
employees,'' Mr. Sussman said. ''They must both understand what the law requires
and the realities of the disease in order to avoid workplace disruptions.''

''Education in the workplace is critical,'' said Rose Walton, chairwoman of the
Department of Allied Health Resources at the State University of New York in
Stony Brook, another speaker at the seminar. ''Management has not yet realized
the impact that AIDS will have on the workplace.''

According to Dr. Walton, it is the responsibility of business and industry to
educate its workers about AIDS, to reach out to employees and their families.
Education should include safe-sex information and even safer needle use, she
said.

''We must separate our desire to stop a drug epidemic and be realistic,'' Dr.
Walton said, adding that AIDS is no longer a disease limited to homosexuals and
drug users.

''If we have supportive and informative companies,'' she said, ''they can build
trust among employees, give employees a message that they are cared for and will
be protected against losing their jobs.''

AIDS is a very emotional topic, and a great deal of fear is associated with it,
said David Graham, bureau chief of the Suffolk County Health Department's
division of public health.

One of the greatest issues of concern about AIDS is the mode of trasmission, he
said, noting that there are only three ways to transmit the virus. They are
through sexual contact, exposure to blood and through perinatal transmission
(from mother to child during childbirth).

Businesses are responsible for disseminating educational materials to employees
and in helping them understand the different categories of risk, Dr. Graham
said.

An employee who is in direct contact with blood and bodily fluids faces the
greatest risk of exposure to AIDS, he said. An employee who works in an
environment where he may be called upon to perform unplanned work with blood or
bodily fluids is in the category of next greatest risk.

Work in a normal occupational setting that does not involve contact with either
blood or bodily fluids poses no risk, Dr. Graham said, adding that exposure to a
shared toilet, telephone or water fountain also is not a source of transmission.

''We must dispel the rumors and myths about contact and performance, and it must
be a continuous process,'' he said.

Aside from information about AIDS, an educational process should include an
opportunity for employees to talk about their feelings and fears, to evaluate
and understand them, said Mr. Silin of the Long Island Association for AIDS
Care. Although the statistics and factual information deal with the intellectual
side of the AIDS issues, he said, there is also an emotional side that must be
addressed.

Because AIDS is such an emotional issue with a stigma still so severe, many
employers and employees are still reluctant to address the issues raised in
connection with the virus in the workplace, Mr. Sussman said.

''With acceleration of the AIDS epidemic, it's fairly safe to suggest that some
day every employer will face an AIDS-related employment situation,'' he said.

''AIDS presents employers with a unique challenge. Courts and administrative
agencies are grappling with, but have not yet provided clear answers to the many
workplace issues raised by the AIDS epidemic.

''The best response to the AIDS epidemic is one rooted in anticipation,
prevention and education.''

    I. Introduction

    This article is based on the experiences of an attorney representing
indigent clients through Legal Aid for a one year period in Washington, D.C.
During this period, Legal Aid had no documented policy for the representation of
what then appeared to be a burgeoning explosion of indigent clients with
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (hereinafter "AIDS") or the family members
of AIDS patients.  n1 The main office of Legal Aid focused its practice in the
area of family law from 1988 through 1989. It was through legal actions for
guardianships and custody of minors that the author gained objective insight
into the AIDS epidemic in the nation's capital. Insofar as the population of
Washington, D.C. was predominantly African-American,  n2 the Legal Aid clientele
reflected these demographics. The Legal Aid Society represented only indigent
Washington, D.C., domiciliaries who could not afford a lawyer.

    Because this author is an African-American, who represented indigent
African-Americans, it was easy gaining the confidence of the clientele.
Moreover, because the author was reared as an indigent, African-American in a
Detroit community, it was easy for the author to communicate in Ebonics  n3 with
the clientele.
 [*52]

    The typical indigent African-American Legal Aid client from 1988 through
1989 spoke Ebonics.  n4 Because of the author's ease in relating with the
clientele, it was possible to gain valuable insight into how the AIDS epidemic
gained entry into the African-American community of Washington, D.C., and its
effect on the family structure. Although this author handled many AIDS related
cases while at Legal Aid, there is one particular case which provides an
excellent insight into this serious urban epidemic.

    II. Simms v. Carmichael  n5

    The AIDS epidemic gained entry into the African-American community of
Washington, D.C., through chronic intravenous narcotism;  n6 and as a result of
death of young parents, the grandparents are taking custody of the orphaned
children. The case of Simms v. Carmichael fits this factual scenario.

    In Simms, the mother died of clinical hypoxic encephalopathy which was
caused by chronic intravenous narcotism. The maternal grandmother, who was the
plaintiff in Simms, took physical custody of the infant grandchild. The common
law husband and biological
 [*53]  father of the infant was hospitalized, an AIDS patient, dying of various
infections at the District of Columbia General Hospital.  n7

    All parties agreed that it was in the best interest of the minor for the
maternal grandmother to have legal custody of the child. The mother was
deceased, and the maternal grandmother was the sole representative of the
estate; moreover, the wishes of the deceased mother were for the maternal
grandmother to have legal custody of the infant. Finally, the father expressed
love and affection for his daughter, and wanted to insure that she would be
adequately cared for after his death.  n8

    The difficulty of this case was the father's extremely weakened physical
condition and inability to leave his hospital bed. Although emaciated and weak,
he was still mentally alert. The legal dilemma was how to settle a child custody
case in the Family Division of the District of Columbia Superior Court, when one
of the parties is physically unable to appear in court.

    III. An Interesting Strategy

    First, it is necessary to plead all cogent operative facts. The plaintiff
must aver, as was done in the Simms case, that the defendant has AIDS and is
physically unable to appear in court.  n9 This puts the trial court on notice as
to the seriousness of the illness of one of the litigants. Moreover, with public
awareness of AIDS from educational programs, courts typically take judicial
notice of the debilitating nature of the deadly virus.  n10

    Just as the plaintiff must be truthful in complete disclosure, so too must
the defendant. Hence, the defendant must file an answer acknowledging his or her
medical condition. Once there is complete disclosure of the fact that one of the
litigants has AIDS, then all the other typical civil procedure matters must be
addressed as normally done in any other civil proceeding.

    In Simms, it was necessary for all parties to sign a Consent Order  n11
vesting custody of the minor in the maternal grandmother.
 [*54]  Furthermore, because the father had AIDS and was unable to be present
for court, counsel shrewdly managed to get a doctor's statement excusing the
father from court.  n12 The doctor's statement excusing an AIDS litigant from
court for a particular hearing is imperative. It is recommended that counsel,
involved with this type of case, file in open court the doctor's statement
excusing an AIDS litigant.  Indeed, an open court filing quickly gives the trial
judge notice of the absence of one of the parties, while simultaneously allowing
the sitting judge a quick review of the case file. In the Simms case, the father
was mentally competent and able to give custodial consent to the maternal
grandmother. However, what happens if the litigant with AIDS suffers from
dementia?

    IV. Representing the AIDS Client with Dementia and other AIDS-Related
Problems

    Medical commentators accept the medical condition of dementia as an AIDS
related sickness.  n13 During the physical condition of dementia, the AIDS
victim looses mental competence. Hence, an AIDS litigant, who suffers from
dementia, can be mentally incompetent and unable to be a party to litigation. In
that case, what can counsel do to remedy this problem?

    The remedy is to have a legal guardian appointed to represent the interests
of the AIDS litigant who suffers from dementia. Unfortunately, this legal
maneuver will cause the incursion of expenses, which an indigent AIDS client may
not be able to afford. This raises an important issue as to how services to the
indigent AIDS client should be paid for.

    Unfortunately, there are no easy solutions to this imminent health problem.
The political danger, as AIDS shifts more to the urban poor and dispossessed, is
that AIDS is becoming viewed as more of a chronic urban problem. "We have to
keep reminding the people that this is not a chronic problem. It is an
epidemic."  n14 Insofar as the AIDS epidemic is the greatest threat to American
civilization, far more dangerous than any Soviet attack, only Congress can
realistically solve this national epidemic. Hence, increased public funding from
the federal government is the best remedy. However,
 [*55]  Congress has not committed itself to solving the AIDS epidemic;
consequently, overburdened local eleemosynary programs now attempt the
impossible task of absorbing forty to eighty thousand new AIDS cases each year.
n15

    Naturally, when the AIDS client has resources and properties, it is
necessary to have a court approved guardian appointed. However, in cases
involving indigent AIDS clients who are mentally competent, it is unnecessary
for the appointment of a guardian; and indeed, it is a burdensome expense for
weak and indigent AIDS sufferers.

    What are some of the other AIDS related problems in this area?

    Indigent AIDS clients are typically uneducated, and were in poor health
prior to their human immune deficiency virus (hereinafter "HIV") infection.  n16
Moreover, the poor and dispossessed are in many instances homeless or live in
shelters; and, they are unlikely to have any community support. Hence, HIV
infection renders the poor and dispossessed the true "untouchables" of American
culture. Thus, the lawyer, representing indigent AIDS clients, must maintain
ties with local eleemosynary programs  n17 which educate and assist people on
living with AIDS. Some of the best, and frequently the only, programs for
helping intravenous drug addicted-AIDS clients, are programs originally created
for gay AIDS patients.  n18 A good strategy is for legal counsel to maintain a
log of all state and local programs that assist AIDS patients.  n19

    In representing indigent AIDS clients, one must expect to encounter clients
with hostility, or embarrassment, and even denial of
 [*56]  HIV infection. Just as all people are unique individuals, indigent HIV
clients are unique persons who handle this fatal condition differently.

    The hostile HIV client typically complains constantly, and exhibits anger
toward the world.  n20 This personality is difficult for a lawyer to represent.
For example, failure to promptly return a telephone call by legal counsel can
cause the angry HIV client to file frivolous complaints, or articulate
hostilities toward the lawyer. Indeed, representation of the hostile HIV client
is demanding. Frequently, because these particular clients are indigent, they
are not receiving professional psychological counselling.

    V. Effective Strategies in Representing a Hostile HIV Client

    First, it is necessary to maintain very analytical records when representing
a hostile HIV client. Thus, what normally could be accomplished through an
informal telephone call, should be addressed via a written letter. Second, the
attorney should try to return the telephone calls of this particular client
promptly, or arrange for another staff person to call the client. Third,
whenever possible, always recommend professional psychiatric help to the angry
HIV client and provide information on where this service is provided for the
indigent. Fourth, always remember that the angry HIV client is very sick even
though no outward physical manifestations are present.

    Although compassion and commitment are essential attributes for the attorney
representing the angry HIV client, it is important for counsel to protect his or
her professional reputation against unjust complaints. There is an old saying
among trial lawyers that "the client can always become the enemy." In other
words, when the client does not like the message, the lawyer-messenger can
become the focus of transferred anger. The angry HIV client is bitter at the
world; thus, shrewd counsel must anticipate these problems and
 [*57]  effectively handle the indigent, bitter HIV client.

    VI. Representing the Embarrassed and Frightened Indigent HIV Client

    The embarrassed HIV client is very frightened of ostracism and
discrimination. These fears are quite rational. For example, in the District of
Columbia there have been many instances of discrimination against HIV infected
persons.  n21 The indigent HIV client has no resources in which to fight this
form of discrimination. Moreover, if indigent HIV clients are employed,
typically, they are the "working poor." The "working poor" earn minimum wage,
and have no health insurance. Therefore, the "working poor" HIV clients keep
their medical condition private because of fear of employment termination.  n22

    Unlike the famous millionaire basketball star Magic Johnson, these HIV
infected persons cannot come forward and disclose their tragic circumstances.
n23 Revelation of HIV infection by the indigent, frequently results in
employment termination and homelessness.

    Perhaps the saddest cases of indigent HIV clients can be found in homeless
shelters of inner cities such as Washington, D.C.


    Increasing numbers of homeless men and women are testing positive for the
AIDS virus or turning up with related illnesses at District shelters, according
to health workers. . . . Among the homeless, many AIDS sufferers also are people
with mental health problems health experts say. They are often alone and afraid.
"Can you imagine what the impact is for a person who is homeless to be told they
are HIV positive?" . . . "They don't have resources or a support system. This is
a person who is already ostracized and who is risking being ostra-  [*58]  cized
again within the shelter. So you have people who keep [the diagnosis] to
themselves[.]"  n24

    The problems of the homeless HIV clients are truly insurmountable. Their
needs are indeed very great, while resources are virtually non-existent. For the
homeless HIV in Washington, D.C., there are no "thousand points of light", a
term former President Bush frequently used to describe private sector social
welfare programs.

    Washington, D.C., is not unique in regard to homeless HIV citizens. There is
evidence to show this problem is typical in most American cities.


    In Newark, one of the nation's poorest and most blighted cities, entire
families are dying from the twin plagues of poverty: drug abuse and AIDS.
Doctors here and in drug-ravaged neighborhoods of nearby New York City say it is
not uncommon to see several members of the same family--typically a mother,
father and several small children--dead or dying from AIDS. Nearly all are
black[.]  n25

    This is but one of many examples of the effects of AIDS on the

    homeless.

    VII. Medical Insights into AIDS

    The legal representation of the indigent AIDS client is different from
representing the HIV positive or AIDS Related Complex  n26 (hereinafter "ARC")
clients who are poor. The term HIV means "human immunodefiency virus." HIV is
the first step of the virus which leads to full blown AIDS.  n27 A person can
carry the HIV virus, and appear to be in an otherwise healthy state. The victim
can progress from ARC to full-blown AIDS.  n28

    All HIV positive persons whether exhibiting no signs, ARC or with full blown
AIDS can transmit the virus to others. How can the virus be transmitted from one
person to another? The AIDS virus can
 [*59]  be passed through sexual intercourse; it can be transmitted through
contact with AIDS infected blood; and it can be passed from a mother to her
newborn child at birth and via the mother's breast milk.  n29 The virus cannot
be transmitted through informal conduct such as coughing or shaking hands.
Hence, the attorney representing the AIDS client does not have to worry about
catching the virus during the normal attorney-client relationship. Indeed, the
doctor who handles blood is at a far greater risk than the attorney who merely
shakes the hand of an AIDS patient. Based on the medical literature on AIDS, a
lawyer representing an AIDS client has virtually no risk of contracting the
virus.

    Casual transmission of AIDS has not yet happened to anyone's knowledge, and
the epidemic has been with us long enough to have resulted in some cases of such
easy infection. There has not been even one.  n30

    Yet, there have been rather unique accidents where the virus has been
transmitted.  n31

    VIII. Conclusion

    The author must admit his own fear of the AIDS virus. We tend to fear that
which we do not understand. No doubt there are doctors who fear this virus as
well, even though they completely understand it.

    The reality of this virus is that it is spreading rapidly all over the
world. Medical commentators predict that soon everybody will personally know
someone who has died as a result of AIDS.  n32 This prediction has become true
for the author of this article. This author's mother died of AIDS.  n33 Indeed,
the experience of representing indi-  [*60]  gent, African-Americans in the
nation's capitol provided this author an excellent insight into the American
AIDS epidemic. Moreover, the AIDS related death of the author's mother provided
a very personal experience, and emotional tragedy.

    The reason AIDS statistics appear so very high among AfricanAmericans when
compared to white Americans is simple to explain.  A vast majority of
African-Americans are indigent and without health insurance. When they become
ill resulting from the AIDS virus, they seek medical treatment from the state
welfare system.  n34 Hence, each AIDS related death is meticulously counted by
the state which pays the bills.

    On the other hand, typically, white Americans have private health insurance
and private doctors.  n35 Hence, it is far easier for whites to keep the
existence of AIDS related deaths private and unreported.  n36 Although some
states have enacted laws requiring
 [*61]  doctors to report all AIDS cases,  n37 the state has no sure way to
enforce these laws. Therefore, the statistics one reads about race and AIDS in
America are misleading.  n38 AIDS is not a Black, Hispanic or gay disease, in
fact, it is not even a disease. It is a virus which attacks the human immune
system rendering its host incapable of warding off germs, diseases or other
viruses; and currently there is no cure for this terrible killer.

    The individuals that fall victim to the AIDS virus are still human beings.
These individuals feel pain, anger, and embarrassment just as anyone else.
Furthermore, these individuals have rights which must be protected. An attorney
with an HIV positive client should keep these important facts in mind when
representing the indigent AIDS client.

people with his disease. He knows it could kill them. Sometimes it bothers him;

    The author's personal experience applying for medical assistance for his
mother dying of AIDS in 1991, coupled with legal representation of indigent
African-American Washington D.C. domiciliaries, provided excellent insight.
Before an applicant receives free medical assistance from the State, said
applicant must disclose analytical financial and medical background data. The
provided information is then meticulously recorded by the State and no doubt
shared with federal authorities. Thus statistical data on medical care to
indigent African-Americans and Hispanics increases recorded AIDS cases for these
groups, compared to wealthier ethnic groups who receive private health care.

Blacks fall within this particular group. The State of Black America 125(19th
ed. 1994).

    Mandatory routine testing of all segments of American society would reflect
a more valid statistical picture of the numbers of AIDS suffers, and their race.
To date, wealth persons have been known to conceal their AIDS from the public
and the State.  For example, "a man who said he had been Rock Hudson's lover
filed suit in 1985 against Hudson's estate, his former secretary, and two
doctors, alleging that all parties concealed the fact that Hudson had AIDS at
the time when the plaintiff and the actor were known to be sexually active."
Supra note 13, at p. 236. As long as there is not mandatory routine testing,
statistical data on AIDS will be skewed along race and class lines and thus
unreliable.

How effective is foreign aid?

LENGTH: 1037 words

DATELINE: Nepal


Nepal, Nov. 26 -- It is debatable whether Nepal consumes aid or aid consumes
Nepal. It's hard for anyone to take sides. One thing is clear that it's been
more than 60 years since Nepal started receiving foreign aid, but there is no
significant change in nation's economic development .

As mentioned in the Foreign Aid Policy 2009, the main objective of foreign
assistance is to utilise the foreign assistance effectively so that the country
can reduce poverty through a high, inclusive and sustainable economic growth.
Unfortunately, these objectives are no more than a sweet slogan. A study report
"Trends of Official Development Assistance (ODA) in Nepal" by Nabaraj Gautam
indicates Nepal is the only country in South Asia, which doesn't have major
progress in micro and macroeconomic indicators although it has more than 60
years of history as a ODA recipient country. "The complicated procedures in
finalising process, difficulty in timely procurement of equipment and
components, findings suitable contractors, internal disturbances and
administrative inefficiency appear to be the major hurdles in the timely
completion of the foreign-aided projects," the report points out.

Foreign aid has played a crucial role in financing Nepal's economic development
since 1951. The US was the first country to provide foreign aid to Nepal. The
Point IV Agreement for Technical Cooperation agreement was signed in 1951 with
the United States Agency for International Development.

Nepal joined the league of aid-recipient countries for its development financing
with the launch of its First Five-Year Plan (1956-61). Since then bilateral as
well as multilateral donor agencies started providing foreign aid to Nepal. When
the multilateral assistance programmes began in the 1970s, a huge amount of
foreign aid was in the

form of multilateral assistance programme directed through the international
development association of the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank
characterised as soft loan.

Various studies indicate that both donors and government are equally responsible
for the failure of an effective utilisation of foreign aid. There is a wide gap
between the government and donors in priority setting of aid expenditure. In
addition, the priorities of donors, their interest and complexities can be
attributed to low absorptive capacity of aid in Nepal.

As suggested by Paris Declaration, the issue of accountability is very important
to enhance aid efficiency. Both the state and the donors should take mutual
accountability for the success of a project by involving the stakeholders.

Critics point out that donor-funded programmes are focused in the centre. For
the effectiveness of the donor-funded programmes/projects, local people need to
get access to information on foreign aid and participate actively.

Madhu Kumar Marasini, joint-secretary and head of the foreign aid coordination
section at the Ministry of Finance, admits that aid effectiveness is not
satisfied. We need to focus on timely implementation of projects to increase the
aid utilisation capacity, he says. The failure of some donor-funded big projects
has fuelled skepticism.

On the other side, high consultancy costs, which in many cases, donors or their
nominees take back is another issue in foreign aid utilisation. The government
should reject foreign aid if it is not in the national interest and conditional.
"Hiring foreign consultants is our compulsion as we don't have expertise in all
areas," Marasini says, adding that the government is trying to set the
limitation of consultants up to 10 percent in the upcoming new foreign aid
policy.

Economist Bishwambhar Pyakurel says lack of a clear foreign aid policy is the
main setback for the utilisation of foreign aid. There is and urgent need to
formulate a policy, which

can provide clear guidelines to the government to priortise development
projects/activities and receive foreign aid in short, medium and long run. Both
grant and loan aid have been spent in the same sector and project due to lack of
priority setting.

The total share of foreign aid in national economy is 3 to 4 percent. However,
around 46 percent of the total foreign aid is out of government's control and
information. The government should figure out how long it needs to receive
foreign aid. Nepal can learn lessons from other Asian countries like South
Korea, Malasiya which were once dependent on foreign aid, but have managed to
gain economic independence gradually. Many projects get the axe once donors
withdraw their support. This kind of dependency has eroded the confidence and
capacity of Nepali bureaucracy and administrative institutions while launching
or continuing the projects without donor support.

The government's capacity to spend foreign aid is also very weak. The complexity
of Public Procurement Act has created problems in utilising foreign aid. In the
name of reducing costs, there are questions of credibility and quality
performance of the contract winning parties. The government should design and
adapt a prompt budget disbursement mechanism for timely spending.

The donor community needs to be transparent towards their own assistance and
should not impose unnecessary conditions. Similarly, the government should be
liberal towards the issues of good governance, inclusion, accountability,
transparency and political stability, which have appeared as cross-cutting
issues of development . While laying out development targets a strong state
mechanism should in place until the goals are met.

In a recent interaction with representatives of the donor community, MoF
officials expressed their dissatisfaction over the aid disbursement system.

According to officials, only 77 percent of the total aid comes through the
budgetary system, whereas 23 percent goes through the off-budget system. Such
off-budget aid has been spent out of the MoF's channel on different pretexts.
The upcoming foreign aid policy needs to address such loopholes and downsides
for the effective utilisation of foreign aid.

World AIDS Day to mark those died deadly disease

SECTION: Vol. XXXV No. 328

LENGTH: 445  words


The United Nations' (UN) World AIDS Day will be observed on December 1st  all
over the world including Pakistan to honour those who have died of AIDS and
those who live with HIV or AIDS and to increase awareness of these conditions.
AIDS is a condition resulting from damages done to the human immune system by
HIV. It affects tens of millions of people around the world.

The theme of World AIDS Day 2011 is "Getting to Zero": zero new infections, zero
discrimination and zero AIDS-related deaths"."Heading into the fourth decade of
AIDS, we are finally in a position to end the epidemic. The progress we have
made so far is roof that we can realize our vision [of getting to zero," said UN
Secretary General Ban-Ki Moon in a press release on World AIDS Day.

Earlier this year, the UN General Assembly High-Level Meeting on AIDS created
goals to reach by 2015: a 50% reduction in the sexual transmission of HIV, no
new infections in children, antiretroviral therapy (ART) for 15 million people
living with HIV, ending stigma and discrimination and closing the AIDS funding
gap.

World AIDS Day is the focal point of the World AIDS Campaign, which is active
all year round. During the days and weeks leading up to World AIDS Day, there
was a lot of coverage of the condition in the media and fundraising for AIDS and
HIV-related charities.

In addition, health education campaigns aiming to reduce the transmission of HIV
and discrimination of people living with HIV and AIDS are often launched on or
around December 1.

On World AIDS Day, many community, national and international leaders issue
proclamations on supporting and treating people living with HIV and AIDS and
stimulating research into the treatment of these conditions.

Local communities hold events to remember and honour members who have died of
AIDS-related conditions or exhibitions around the subject. AIDS stands for
"acquired immune deficiency syndrome" or "acquired immunodeficiency syndrome"
and denotes a condition, which results from the damage done by HIV (human
immunodeficiency virus) to the immune system. The condition was first identified
in 1981 and the name "AIDS" was first introduced on July 27, 1982.

There has been a lot of stigma around the spread of HIV and people living with
HIV and AIDS. It has been estimated that around 33 million people around the
world have been infected with HIV and that around two million people die from
AIDS related conditions each year. On October 27, 1988, the UN General Assembly
officially recognized that the World Health Organization declared December 1,
1988, to be World AIDS Day. World AIDS Day has also been observed on this date
each year since then.

Taiwan vice-president urges care of AIDS patients, end to discrimination

LENGTH: 566 words


Text of report in English by Taiwanese Central News Agency website

[By Andrew Lee]

Taipei, Nov. 30 (CNA) - Vice President Vincent Siew urged the Taiwan society
Sunday to show concern for people suffering from Acquired Immune Deficiency
Syndrome (AIDS) instead of discriminating against them.

"We should focus our efforts on AIDS prevention, " said Siew."As long as we
invest our efforts, there will be results."

Siew was invited to speak at a press conference held by the Disease Control
Centre (CDC) of the Department of Health on the eve of World AIDS Day to promote
AIDS prevention and control. It was also aimed at raising public awareness of
the need to support and care for people infected with AIDS.

"I hope that our community will show AIDS victims love and care instead
discriminating against them, " said Siew. "If we devote care to the fight
against AIDS, then I'm confident that we can stop the threat of the disease."

According to Siew, President Ma Ying-jeou is supportive of the the country's
anti-AIDS efforts. Everyone, whether in the public or private sector, should
join the fight against AIDS, he added.

"This is not a crisis of one country, it is everywhere in the world - all
countries should be involved in the effort to counter AIDS," said Siew.

Siew recalled that when he went to Haiti during his term as premier, he found
that there were numerous AIDS patients there.

"Taiwan has provided medicines to help the people of Haiti, " he said.

He also spoke of his visit to Swaziland, and the toll that the AIDS epidemic has
taken on that Southern African country.

"When I went to Swaziland, I discovered that one third of the population had
been stricken by AIDS, " said Siew. "The average life expectancy of the people
there is 37 to 38 years old. This is due to the spread of the AIDS epidemic. I
think this is a problem that concerns the whole world."

Siew stressed that AIDS prevention and control is one of the most critical
global health issues. In addition to devoting care to AIDS patients and not
discriminating against them, there is also a need to protect their human rights,
he added.

To help reduce the spread of AIDS, the Executive Yuan in 2001 established the "
AIDS Prevention and Control Commission, " which integrates the resources of 12
government agencies and grassroots groups.

"Taiwan began fighting AIDS at early stage, and we focused on prevention as our
strategy, " said Siew. "This approach has had good results, " he added, noting
that the CDC also promotes AIDS screening programmes for pregnant women, among
other programmes.

"Taiwan is one of few countries in the world where the government provides free
medication for AIDS victims, " said Siew. "I am pleased to say that our citizens
support the government's AIDS policy."

World AIDS Day, observed on Dec. 1 each year, is dedicated to raising awareness
of the AIDS pandemic caused by the spread of HIV infection.

Despite recent improved access to antiretroviral treatment and care in many
regions of the world, the AIDS epidemic claimed an estimated 3.1 million lives
in 2005, of which 570,000 were children.

The concept of World AIDS Day originated at the 1988 World Summit of Ministers
of Health on Programmes for AIDS Prevention. Since then, it has been taken up by
governments, international organizations and charities around the world.

Financial aid: How to find and make the most of it

SECTION: SPECIAL SECTION; Pg. 06

LENGTH: 542 words


About financial aid

The major source of student financial aid is the U.S. Department of Education.
About 70 percent of the student aid awarded each year comes from the U.S.
Department of Education's programs (approximately $73 billion in fiscal year
2005). The department's aid includes grants, loans and work-study.

Where can you find free information?

The following sources usually have information about aid from the federal
government and your state government; most can tell you about funds from your
local community and private sources as well.

A college or career school financial aid office: Talk to the financial aid
administrator at the school you plan to attend. Be sure to ask about
"institutional aid" - money the school itself awards students. The school's
catalog or Web site is also a good source of information about aid available at
the school.

A local or college library: Relevant materials are usually listed under "student
aid" or "financial aid." If you need help, ask the reference librarian.

The Internet: Search using the key words "student aid" or "financial aid."
Remember that many scams operate over the Internet, so if an Internet service
charges a fee, research it carefully. You can also go to the U.S. Department of
Education's site at  www.studentaid.ed.gov.

A high school counselor's office: Many counselors have a large selection of
materials, know what recent graduates have received, and can guide you to free
online information.

Where can you find more information?

You can get free materials from the financial aid office at your college, career
school, or the guidance counselor's office at your high school. These include
the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) as well as a print version
of Funding Education Beyond High School: The Guide to Federal Student Aid.

You also can request copies by calling the Federal Student Aid Information
Center toll free at (800) 4-FED-AID, or (800) 433-3243.

Most federal student aid is awarded based on financial need rather than
scholastic achievement.

However, you do not have to show financial need to receive certain federal
student loans.

You may apply for federal student aid at no cost by filing a paper FAFSA or
applying electronically with FAFSA on the Web, the online application for
federal student aid. All you need for FAFSA on the Web is a computer that
supports an education department-approved browser. FAFSA on the Web is at
www.fafsa.ed.gov.

What about aid from other agencies?

Student aid is available from other federal agencies, such as the U.S.
Department of Health & Human Services and the U.S. Department of Veterans
Affairs. For links to such information, visit  www.students.gov

Who else awards aid to students?

Student aid also may be available from foundations, community organizations, and
organizations related to your field of interest.

Contact the organizations directly for detailed information. Check with your
parents' employers to find out whether they award scholarships or have tuition
payment plans.

Although funds from these sources make up a small percentage of the total aid
awarded each year, it's worth doing the research - you never know what you might
find.

Find value in hearing aid

BYLINE: By Evangeline Mitchell, Business Writer

SECTION: SAN MATEO; Business

LENGTH: 935 words


IF YOUR HEARING isn't as good as it used to be, you may be thinking about
getting a hearing aid.

Then again, there's a good chance you can't be bothered, even though you find
yourself cranking up the volume on the TV set or asking a friend sitting next to
you to speak up. If so, you are not alone.

More often than not, people put off getting a hearing aid after they first
notice it's getting harder to hear, said East Bay audiologist Leigh Kleldsen
"People wait an average of seven years between knowing they have a problem with
hearing and doing something about it."

Why the wait?

HEARIBusiness 3 "People don't know about the process and don't know where to
begin," said Kleldsen, owner of Valley Audiology, which has offices in Concord
and Walnut Creek.

The first step is to get your hearing tested by a hearing professional. That's
followed by more evaluations to help the patient determine what type of hearing
aid would best fit his or her hearing needs. Once a hearing aid is selected,
there is a fitting, which involves adjusting the hearing aid to best meet the
patient's hearing needs. Often, patients come back for further adjustments after
the initial fitting.

While a hearing aid can indeed improve your life by improving your ability to
hear, they are not cheap. The cost of a quality analog hearing aid can go from
$900 to $1200, whereas a digital aid can range from

$1,300 to $3,000, according to the Mayo Clinic Web site. And that's just for
one.

"Some people need one; some people need two," depending on their hearing needs,
said Kjeldsen.

Digital hearing aids, which are programmed by a computer, allow for more
flexibility and fine tuning of the hearing aid so that it can be adjusted to
hearing fluctuations as well as different hearing environments.

"Hearing aids nowadays I like to think of them as miniature computers. They are
programmed for each individual's hearing loss ... It's not one size fits all ...
Once the hearing aid is programmed, it can be reprogrammed," said Green.

Today, requests for analog

hearing aids are rare, said Kleldsen."

"Just about all the hearing aids sold these days are digital," she said. "I
would say in the last five years there have been incredible advances in what a
(digital) hearing aid can do."

Hearing aids cover a wide range when it comes to prices.

"People need to know there is a very wide range of cost per hearing aid and that
all depends on the level of technology," said Robert Green, an audiologist at
Alta Bates Summit Medical Center. Smaller, less visible hearing aids tend to
cost more than larger ones, he said.

Hearing aids may need to be replaced after several years of use to accommodate a
person's changing hearing needs. However, digital aids have more flexibility
when it comes to programming for shifting conditions.

Not only are hearing aids expensive, but Medicare won't pay for them. That means
people have to either buy a hearing aid as an out-of-pocket expense or have
supplemental Medicare or retiree insurance to help foot the bill. Some financial
assistance programs to help people buy hearing aids may be available from
nonprofit and government agencies.

Hearing loss affects more than 28 million Americans, including nearly 6 million
children.

With baby boomers (those born between 1946 and 1964) starting to turn 60 last
year, the number of people with hearing loss is expected to nearly double by the
year 2030, according to the Hearing Loss Association of America. The likelihood
of losing your hearing increases as you get older, with up to one in three
people over the age of 65 having some kind of hearing loss, according to the
Association.

Although 95 percent of Americans with a hearing loss can be successfully treated
with hearing aids, only 22 percent (or 6.35 million individuals) currently use
hearing aids.

"Hearings aids are very expensive, so a lot of people are convinced they are not
going to get value for what they are paying. There is a lot of skepticism," said
Green.

In California, consumers can obtain hearing aids from three kinds of hearing aid
dispensers: hearing aid specialists, dispensing audiologists or a physician
licensed as a hearing aid dispenser.

All three types of hearing aid dispensers have to be licensed and pass written
and practical examinations related to their field.

Audiologists are required to have at least a master's degree related to
audiology (an educational requirement that is in the process of being upgraded
to the doctoral level). To become a licensed hearing aid specialist requires a
high school degree and work under the supervision of a licensed hearing aid
dispenser for at least three years.

When choosing a hearing aid dispenser, it's good idea to get recommendations
from friends. Senior citizens might want to check with a local senior club.
Also, check with your local Better Business Bureau to see if any complaints have
been filed.

Many hearing aid sales are the result of referrals made by primary care doctors
or a friend or family member that has come to Valley Audiology, said Kleldsen.

But there are also times when a person with a hearing problem is brought in by a
spouse or child who will say, "She just can't hear any more," said Green.

"What is at the heart of this whole process is whether or not the person (with
the hearing problem) is actually ready for (a hearing aid). She is the one who
is going to wear it. She is the one who has to make the decision ... It's not
something people are kind of excited about. But, for a lot of people, it's a
necessity."

The realm of AIDS fiction

SECTION: Readings fortnightly with Alina Rastam; Pg. 5

LENGTH: 1208 words


ABOUT five or six years ago, when I was a postgraduate student in Britain,
I became interested in literature about AIDS. Literary responses to the
pandemic at that time appeared to be burgeoning. Prior to the mid-
Eighties, works about AIDS had seemed few and far between - some short
stories here, some poems there, but no significant body of work. But by
the early 1990s, the situation had changed quite considerably. More works
with AIDS as their theme or as one of their themes were being published,
more writers took on the challenge of dealing with AIDS and its
implications in their work, and outstanding pieces of writing such as
Rebecca Brown's short story A Good Man' or Paul Monette's book Halfway
Home appeared.

Part of what excited me about AIDS fiction then was its newness, its
potential to become generally established or accepted as a new genre in
literature, and its status as a developing or evolving genre.

To a certain extent, of course, all genres are constantly evolving, but
whereas the basic tenets and characteristics of established genres such as
crime or fantasy fiction had been formed or laid down a long time ago,
AIDS fiction was still in its infancy. Thus, the writers engaged in this
field were in effect establishing its parameters and charting its course.
They were dealing with issues as basic as creating the kind of language
which was necessary in writing about AIDS.

Speaking about her novel People in Trouble (1990), for example, the
American writer Sarah Schulman said, "Developing a vocabulary for AIDS
fiction is a really major part of this book. When I first started writing
there was no way to talk about AIDS, there was no language ... We're the
first generation of AIDS writers, there is no great novel that has come
out of AIDS yet. What we can do is start to establish a vocabulary that
future writers can use as a foundation to build on to discuss the issue."

Things have moved on since then and by now, although AIDS fiction is
still a little recognised genre (as seen, for instance, in the fact that
even recently published reference books on English Literature either do
not have entries on literature about AIDS, or merely mention it in
relation to categories such as Gay Writing), it is possible to identify
some of its main themes or characteristics.

A key feature of AIDS fiction is its representation of the culture which
has been built up around AIDS. In People in Trouble, for example, Schulman
constructs a cultural dimension to AIDS in her depiction of the symbolism
or symbolic gestures associated with the disease, such as the wearing of
black ribbons; the rituals, as seen for example in the scene where people
sing Over the Rainbow' during an AIDS awareness march while releasing
white balloons marked with the names of loved ones lost to AIDS, and the
rites of passage. For instance, Molly, one of the book's three main
characters, shares a drink with a man she knows to be HIV positive and
explains to her friend Sam that "It's a rite of passage. People who are
HIV positive invariably offer you a drink out of their glass. It's a test
to see if you're informed enough to know you can't get it that way."

The depiction of the culture inhabited by people whose lives have been
touched by AIDS validates it, presents it as an important aspect of
communal or societal responses to AIDS. In some texts, it is also related
to the exploration of how people ascribe value and significance to their
experience of AIDS. The AIDS awareness demonstration depicted by Schulman,
for instance, is a means by which the marchers challenge government
inaction by publicly asserting the importance of what AIDS has done to
them and their loved ones.

The focus on grief is another striking characteristic of AIDS fiction,
and it is probably fair to say that AIDS fiction delineates the poetics of
grief and the anatomy of despair to an extent seen in few other genres.
Grief and loss, and their attendant states - fear, anger, hopelessness,
rage - are dwelt upon in every piece of AIDS fiction I've read.

In some texts, such as Brown's A Good Man' (in my view, a truly fine
story) or People in Trouble, the desolation and grief felt by those who
lose loved ones to AIDS are described. In others, the grief and fear of
those living with AIDS are laid bare. Thus, in a stark and strangely
lyrical passage, the narrator of David Feinberg's powerful short story
 Despair: August 1987', says that

And now I never sleep through the night; I always wake up at three or
four, tense, filled with anxiety. Like Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz, I sit,
watching helplessly as my T-cell count drops every three months, the sands
of time running out.

... And one day I was sitting at a coffee shop, and my nose began to
bleed spontaneously ... The blood dripped bright red onto the plate, onto
the napkin. All I could think of was the virus that was coursing through
my blood. I blotted it out with the napkin and sat there ashamed,
frightened, in despair.

Yet another distinctive aspect of AIDS fiction is the frequency with
which it depicts gay characters and communities. Perhaps this is because
in countries such as the UK or the US, in which many of the writers
working in this field are based, gay communities felt the impact of AIDS
earlier than straight ones and thus have had more time in which to produce
fictional responses to it. Or perhaps consciousness of discrimination
against gay people in the medical profession and governmental responses to
HIV/AIDS impelled gay writers to turn to fiction as a way of challenging
this discrimination.

Whatever the cause, and in spite of the dangers of perpetuating the myth
that AIDS is a gay disease which the British writer Adam Mars-Jones has
alerted us to - "At a time when media coverage tends to push the issues
of Aids (sic) and homosexuality closer and closer together, as if epidemic
and orientation were synonymous, how can (gay writers) justify writing
fiction that brings this spurious couple together all over again?"
(Introduction, Monopolies of Loss) - the experience of AIDS as
represented in AIDS fiction is predominantly a gay one.

And while the space accorded to gay writers and works in AIDS fiction is
refreshing, given the invisibilising of non-heterosexual experience in
most of literature, it will be interesting to see, as the genre develops,
whether works presenting other perspectives on AIDS - for example,
heterosexual, bisexual, celibate - will eventually have a presence in
AIDS fiction.

James, a character in People in Trouble, says about AIDS that "the
challenge is to turn it from an overwhelming personal void into a group
effort, to try and help others avoid the same fate".

This, I think, is the main thing which writers dealing with AIDS are
trying to do: produce a body of writing which will express the impact AIDS
has had on individuals, communities, societies, and which will help to
"turn it from an overwhelming personal void into a group effort".

Such an effort was desperately needed when writers first began to deal
with AIDS in their work. Sadly, it is still desperately needed now.

Aid dollars should go where they can do some good: Dexter Samida argues that
Canada's foreign aid appears to be fool's gold

BYLINE: Dexter Samida, For the Calgary Herald

SECTION: Comment; A11

LENGTH: 806 words

DATELINE: VANCOUVER


Recent calls for debt relief for some of the world's most heavily indebted
nations have rekindled interest in the examination of foreign aid policy. A
recent editorial in The Vancouver Sun, for example, maintained that ''taxpayers,
including Canadians, should be generous -- but not taken for fools'' and aid
should ''be directed to those with proper standards of government and the rule
of law.''

These statements beg the following interrelated questions: Have we been taken
for fools? In other words, what has been the return on our foreign aid dollars?
Is Canadian aid being directed properly?

The evidence on these questions has been thoroughly depressing. Researchers from
organizations as disparate as the London School of Economics, the Cato Institute
and the Congressional Budget Office have found little evidence that aid improves
growth or living standards.

Economist Peter Boone went so far as to suggest that ''aid flows primarily to
benefit a wealthy political elite'' and thus aid ''does not benefit the poor.''
Fools, indeed.

One major reason why aid fails is the indiscriminate manner in which it is
distributed. In particular, donor countries have ignored an important criterion
-- the quality of the recipient country's economic management -- when making aid
decisions.

The dangers of this neglect are illustrated in recent World Bank research
showing that aid given to poorly governed nations had either no effect or a
negative effect on growth. Only aid flowing to better-governed jurisdictions was
found to assist growth. While the research suggests how aid should be allocated,
its lessons have not been followed in practice. According to World Bank
research, aid allocation ''shows little relationship with the quality of country
management. '' In fact, it found that ''being a former colony of a major donor
is more valuable in attracting bilateral assistance than having good
management.''

Surprisingly, even corrupt countries do not receive less aid. Researchers
Alberto Alesina from Harvard University and Beatrice Weder from the University
of Basel concluded that ''according to most measures, corrupt governments
actually receive more foreign aid rather than less.'' They also were unable to
find evidence that increases in foreign aid reduced corruption.

Unfortunately, Canada's foreign aid experience mirrors the picture painted by
Alesina and Weder. To assess the Canadian experience, we can use the economic
freedom index found in the Economic Freedom of the World series published by 53
research institutes in as many countries. A country's ranking in the index is
based upon measures such as monetary policy, access to an impartial judiciary,
rule of law, taxes and size of government.

A quick examination of the data shows us that Canadian aid has
disproportionately gone to the least free countries. Over 70 per cent of total
Canadian aid went to the bottom 40 per cent of countries in terms of economic
freedom.

Because research indicates that aid flowing to poorly managed jurisdictions is
not beneficial, this means that much of Canadian aid has likely been wasted.
Supporting poor countries only because they are poor, an intuitive concept, can
lead to misdirected aid expenditures.

Even more disappointing is the tendency to support governments, rather than
non-governmental organizations, in countries with little economic freedom. If
power is concentrated in the government, one option is to counterbalance some of
this power by directing aid expenditures outside of the government in the hope
the government will be pressured to reform. But Canada has not pursued this
avenue. Canada's government-to-government aid, as a percentage of total aid, is
highest in countries with the lowest levels of economic freedom. Those
distributing foreign aid should look at a number of indicators, including the
quality of policies enacted, the level of economic freedom, and corruption
before even considering aid decisions. Countries at the lower end of these
scales should not receive any aid unless such giving can secure legitimate
reform; the evidence shows that giving them aid will not help them.

After choosing potential recipient countries, aid dollars should flow where they
can further develop the infrastructure and the institutions necessary for
private investment and higher levels of economic freedom. By engaging in these
types of activities, we can be assured that we are indeed helping.

If a government cannot commit itself to such reforms, the best policy may be to
cut off foreign aid completely and rely on voluntary charity and private
investment flows. These are more likely means of helping the world's poor;
foreign aid may not be.

Dexter Samida is a research economist at The Fraser Institute, a Vancouver-based
public policy organization.

MONEY & MORE: FINDING HELP: 'Free aid' is out there, but early bird gets it

BYLINE: Sandy Amann John, For the Journal-Constitution

SOURCE: AJC

SECTION: Business; Pg. 3P

LENGTH: 847 words

Q: I will be attending graduate school in the fall and would like information
about grants and scholarships. Can you help?

Rolanda Daniel, 23, graduated from Agnes Scott College in 1998 with a bachelor's
degree in psychology and Africana. During a year off from academics, she worked
at Equifax, using the time to evaluate what she wants to do in the future and to
save money for graduate school.

She has been accepted in the master's program in city planning at Georgia Tech,
and plans to start classes Aug. 23. But financial aid is "imperative," she said.
"I've saved for it, but you never can save enough."

Tech has offered her a subsidized Stafford loan. The federal government pays the
interest on this type of loan while the student remains in school, and she does
not have to begin repayment until six months after graduation or leaving school
for any other reason.

Daniel, however, was hoping for grants and wanted tips on how to get that kind
of aid.

Patrick Bellantoni, a certified financial planner with Bellantoni Financial
Advisory, looked at Daniel's situation and gave her guidance.

Financial aid falls into two categories: loans, which must be paid back, and
"free aid" such as grants and scholarships that require no repayment. For
graduate students, federal aid, which makes up the lion's share of money
available to students, is limited to loans and work-study programs, Bellantoni
said, and Georgia offers aid to graduate students only if they are going into
teaching.

Georgia Tech might have its own "free aid" programs for graduate students, but
Daniel has missed the deadline for this academic year, Bellantoni said. He
suggested she contact the financial aid office to see what aid she might be
eligible for next year, and to apply early for it.

Deadlines for financial aid vary widely by school but can be as early as
November of the year before the academic year begins for graduate students, and
January for undergrads, he said.

"Rolanda is a victim of the two most widely misunderstood issues by financial
aid applicants," said Bellantoni, author of a book on applying for college
financial aid, "College Financial Aid Made Easy." Those issues are adherence to
deadlines and making the college aware of special circumstances.

Financial aid is given out on a first-come, first-served basis, and because
Daniel applied near the deadline, grant money already had been given out.

"Even though you may be worthier than another student, if that student submits
the application ahead of you and meets the normally very strict eligibility
requirements for that particular aid program, he, not you, will get the funds,"
Bellantoni said.

The system works this way because schools have to match millions of dollars in
aid to thousands of students, and it's a "logistical nightmare," said
Bellantoni, a member of the Georgia Society of the Institute of Certified
Financial Planners. Federal guidelines also govern how most of the money is
allocated.

By getting her financial aid application in early for the next academic year,
Daniel will have a better chance for receiving aid, the planner said.

But what about this year? Daniel will be living at her parents' East Point home
while attending graduate school and will not have a job. That's where making the
school aware of special circumstances comes into play, Bellantoni said.

Certain special circumstances give a college's financial aid administrator more
leeway in designing an aid package. Examples include divorce, high medical
expenses, bankruptcy and job loss. "Rolanda's special circumstance is that she
will not be working while she attends school," the planner said.

On her financial aid application, she was required to report her income for
1998, when she was working for Equifax. Income is weighed heavily in determining
aid eligibility.

Daniel's "expected family contribution" was set at more than $ 4,000, based on
the information on her aid application. That is the amount of money the student
or her family is expected to pay toward her education, determined by a complex
federal formula applied to all aid applicants. The cost of school (tuition,
room, board, books, fees, etc.) minus the expected family contribution is the
amount of aid for which the student is eligible. When the school is notified of
Daniel's job loss, her expected contribution should be lowered substantially,
making her eligible for more aid.

When a special circumstance is encountered after applying for aid, it's
important to notify the college's financial aid office as soon as possible.

Failure to communicate with the college aid office is another common reason a
student doesn't get maximum financial aid, Bellantoni noted. In his book, he
advises applicants to reply quickly to all correspondence they get from the aid
office, supplying documents or other information as requested. If you receive a
letter you don't understand from the college or a federal or state office, call
the person who signed the letter and ask for clarification as soon as possible,
he said.

DONATIONS FALL AS GAINS BUILD IN AIDS FIGHT / AS MORE PEOPLE ARE LIVING WITH THE
DISEASE, CHARITIES ARE FINDING IT HARDER TO RAISE FUNDS.

As Dining Out for Life, the Philadelphia-born AIDS fund-raising event, marks its
seventh year on Thursday by going national, the AIDS fund-raising machine finds
itself at a turning point.

AIDS is still claiming lives, but it's not the killer it used to be.

AIDS is not the front-page dread disease it used to be.

And it apparently is not the fund-raising cause it used to be.

"People are hearing from the media that AIDS is not a terminal disease or
crisis," said Eric Wichner, executive director of the AIDS Fund, which produces
Philadelphia's annual AIDS Walk. "That doesn't really do much for fund-raising."
The 1996 walk raised $1.43 million; last year's raised $100,000 less.

AIDS agencies, which for years dispensed emergency services and operated in a
crisis mode, have knuckled down and begun banding together to help the hundreds
of thousands of people living with AIDS. Some groups have even cut back
dramatically, including the San Francisco-based Names Project Foundation,
organizer of the AIDS Quilt, perhaps the most tangible symbol of the grass-roots
effort against AIDS. The group recently laid off more than half of its paid
staff.

Around the country, agencies have found they must do more with less, cobbling
together budgets from donations, fund-raising events and a stagnant pool of
government money.

ActionAIDS, Pennsylvania's largest AIDS group and organizer of Dining Out for
Life, recently began broadening services to a growing number of clients. It
added a job-training program and a job bank - two signs that many people with
AIDS are fit enough to work and require more than just help with housing and hot
meals.

And it is doing this with a tightened budget that led to the layoffs of five
employees from the paid staff of 65.

"We have to be creative and look to other sources for funding," said Kevin
Conare, the ActionAIDS executive director. To fund the jobs programs, ActionAIDS
is trying to tap sources it has never before approached: the Office of Housing
and Community Development and the Private Industry Council.

AIDS WALK SHORTFALL The AIDS Fund, a fund-raising clearinghouse that contributes
to local groups such as ActionAIDS, has changed the focus of its fund-raising
efforts to make up the shortfall from the AIDS Walk. "I can't ask 100,000 people
to write a check," Wichner said. "But we have a system where we identify
[individual fund-raising] leaders. So we have 28,000 people asking others for
support."

When the government first began counting AIDS cases in the early 1980s,
virtually everyone in whom the disease was diagnosed died - as many as 94
percent in 1984, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. By
1994, that case-fatality rate had been cut in half, although the number of new
reported AIDS cases still was six times higher than it was in 1984.

After a new generation of AIDS drugs - which are mixed with older drugs in
so-called AIDS cocktails - the case-fatality rate dropped even more
dramatically, to 6 percent last year. And in 1996, the number of AIDS deaths
actually declined for the first time. Last fall, accidents replaced AIDS as the
leading cause of death among Americans ages 25 to 44.

But there's a flip side to the medical field's success.

Since 1991, the number of people living with AIDS has more than doubled, to
239,000 as of 1996, the most recent federal count.

"We used to have 300 to 500 new clients a year and many would die," said Conare
of ActionAIDS. "Now we get 500 new clients, but people are living longer."
ActionAIDS has a caseload of 1,000 clients, about 30 percent more than two years
ago.

MORE ARE LIVING What once was a death sentence is now considered a chronic but
manageable disease.

In many ways, Conare is a paradigm of people with AIDS today.

For years, Conare's T-cell count was 175. Anyone whose count is below 200 is
considered to have full-blown AIDS. "Now that I'm on protease inhibitors, my
count is 450," he said. That means Conare still has HIV, the virus that causes
AIDS, but his immune system is recovering and he can expect to live much longer.

But living with AIDS is expensive. Conare said he was fortunate because his
insurance covered almost all of his $1,000-a-month drug bill. Many ActionAIDS
clients do not have insurance, and even those who do cannot afford the
out-of-pocket costs.

"It's hard when we talk about the medical advances with jubilation," Conare
cautioned. "We're also caring for a lot of people who are dying."

The medical advances in AIDS have been so dramatic that many activists fear the
public will become complacent and let down its guard, prompting a resurgence in
HIV. This is happening particularly among the young in minority communities.

Fund-raising executives inside and outside the AIDS world say there has been a
backlash to the years of unbridled fund-raising efforts for AIDS.

There are no available figures on how much money has been raised for AIDS social
agencies nationwide. The federal government has devoted more than $1 billion a
year to AIDS research and programs, prompting advocate groups such as the
American Heart Association to argue that more money was being spent per patient
on AIDS than on heart disease.

"I've heard all kinds of criticism," Wichner said. "People have asked me
point-blank, 'Why is AIDS more horrible than heart disease or cancer?' "

AIDS activists counter that unlike cancer or heart disease, HIV is an infectious
disease and hits people in the prime of life.

Still, the AIDS Fund has noticed an increase in corporate giving. "Every
corporation has had a personal experience with AIDS," Wichner said.

To bolster personal giving, AIDS groups are responding with new fund-raising
events, such as the AIDS Fund's Gay Bingo.

ActionAIDS' Dining Out for Life this year has added corporate sponsorship from
Sprint PCS, which contributed $15,000 in fees, materials and promotional
support.

Founded by Wichner and former ActionAIDS volunteer Julie Drizin over a glass of
wine during the height of the AIDS panic, Dining Out for Life solicits
restaurants to donate one-third of a day's food receipts to ActionAIDS. The
first Dining Out for Life, in 1992, attracted about 30 city restaurants and
raised about $40,000, Conare said. This year, Dining Out has attracted 160
restaurants in the region and conservatively expects to take in $100,000. The
event also will be held in 15 other cities on Thursday; all told, the one-day
event is expected to raise $1 million for AIDS groups.

"I travel," said Drizin, now based in Washington for Pacifica Radio. "I really
get a kick when I'm in a city and see the Dining Out for Life logo."

15 ways you can't get AIDS

SOURCE: Prevention magazine

BYLINE: Andre Roblin

SECTION: FLORIDIAN; Pg. 1D

LENGTH: 1655 words



There's no question: The fear of AIDS is far more widespread than AIDS
itself. There is plenty of evidence, though, that much of the fear is
unnecessary. And harmful.

     Our best protection against the fear - and the virus - is    scientific
knowledge. The knowledge boils down to this: It's tough to    get the AIDS
virus. It's tough, or impossible, even in situations where    you might think
AIDS would be inevitable.

     The following are 15 situations you've probably wondered about -    with
reasons why the odds are in your favor.

 You can't get AIDS simply sharing an elevator with one - or even a    dozen -
AIDS patients.



   Unlike the common-cold virus, the AIDS virus infects blood cells -    it
can't become airborne in breath.

     "The AIDS virus hijacks genes and enzymes from white blood cells    to
replicate itself," says AIDS expert Dr. Margaret A. Fischl of the    University
of Miami. "It can't do that outside the body."

 You can't get AIDS simply sharing a Perrier or pizza with someone    who's
infected.



   The infected person could leave saliva on your Perrier and pizza and    you'd
still be safe, for two reasons: First, the virus is rarely found    in saliva.
In a study of 83 AIDS patients, for instance, the virus    turned up in the
saliva of only one (New England Journal of Medicine,    Dec. 19, 1985).

     Second, saliva inactivates the virus. In studies of households and
families with an infected member, AIDS patients shared food and drink,
plates, glasses, cutlery and toothbrushes with uninfected people. No    one got
AIDS this way (New England Journal of Medicine, Feb. 6, 1986).

 You can't get AIDS simply shaking hands with or hugging an infected    person.



   The virus isn't found in sweat or on skin. In household studies,    people
hugged and had lots of other close, non-sexual contact. Not one    case of AIDS
was spread this way (New England Journal of Medicine,    Oct. 29, 1987).

 You can't get AIDS simply by being sneezed on or coughed on by an AIDS
patient.



   The AIDS virus has not been found in the phlegm or nasal mucus of    infected
people. All experts, including U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett    Koop, agree
there's no evidence the virus spreads through this kind of    casual contact.

 You can't get AIDS simply sitting on a toilet seat even if the person    who
used it before you was infected.



   "The virus can't live on a toilet seat," says Charles P. Fallis of    the
Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta. "It dies immediately    in open
air."

     The virus has sometimes been found in urine, but in quantities so    small
scientists think the virus is not transmitted this way. The AIDS    virus has
also been isolated in feces. But in 11 studies of more than    700 AIDS patients
who lived and shared toilets with uninfected people,    the virus never spread
this way. In no known case has contact with    urine or feces - on a toilet seat
or anyplace else - led to infection    (Journal of the American Medical
Association, March 4, 1988).

 You can't get AIDS simply swimming in a pool or soaking in a hot tub    even if
someone else in the water is infected.



   "Because there's no evidence of infection through much more    intensive
exposures to urine, the risk from urine in swimming pools and    hot tubs is
negligible," says Dr. Alan R. Lifson, M.P.H., of the San    Francisco Department
of Public Health's AIDS office. And, as we've    said, the virus isn't found in
sweat or on skin, and the risk from    feces is negligible. Anyway, the virus
can't survive in water.

 You can't get AIDS simply kissing an infected person on the cheek or    lips.



   Again, there's no evidence saliva transmits the virus. People in the
household studies kissed each other without spreading AIDS.

     Still, the surgeon general advises against French-kissing someone    who
might be infected. Transmission through French kissing has never    been
documented. But because the virus has been isolated in saliva    (although in
rare cases), it is sensible to play it safe.

 You can't get AIDS simply eating in a restaurant even if the chef is
infected.



   We've already established you can't get AIDS through contact with    saliva,
sweat and skin. But what if - in a worst-case scenario - an    infected chef
cuts himself and bleeds on a salad you have later with    your dinner? The risk
is still negligible. Experts say that the amount    of virus that could be
present in a few drops of infected blood is    scant. And the likelihood that
the virus could survive passage through    the digestive tract is extremely
small.

 You can't get AIDS simply donating blood.



   The myth that the virus could be acquired this way started because    of the
risk of receiving infected blood. People twisted the concept    around and
figured it's risky to give blood. But it's just not true,    according to the
CDC. There is no risk whatsoever when needles are used    only once as they are
for blood donors in the United States.

     The AIDS virus may spread on unsterilized needles during    acupuncture,
tattooing and ear piercing. Sterilization, however,    eliminates all risks.
Dipping needles in a 1:10 dilution of bleach,    alcohol, hydrogen peroxide or
Lysol kills the virus. So does 10 minutes    of 140-degree heat.

 You can't get AIDS by being bitten by mosquitoes or other insects.



   This myth gained currency when researchers theorized that mosquitoes    might
have spread AIDS in Belle Glade, where an outbreak occurred from    1982 to 1987
among people with no known risk factors.

     The myth - and the Belle Glade scare - was laid to rest by three    pieces
of evidence. First, AIDS is age-specific. Most infected people    are age 20 to
49. Insects do not discriminate by age; sexually    transmitted diseases do.
Second, in Belle Glade scientists eventually    found sex and intravenous drug
abuse were the routes of infection.

 Third, there is no evidence of the AIDS virus in insects (Science, Jan.    8,
1988).

 You can't get AIDS from the hepatitis-B vaccine or gamma-globulin    shot.



   This myth started because the gamma-globulin shot and one form of    the
hepatitis-B vaccine are derived from blood, raising the possibility    of the
AIDS virus being present in these products.

     Despite administration of these preventives to thousands of people,    no
cases of AIDS have been linked to the vaccine or gamma-globulin    shot, which
is used to prevent hepatitis A. The process used to make    them inactivates all
known viruses, including the AIDS virus.

 You can't get AIDS from pets and other non-humans, even those infected    with
AIDS-like diseases.



   The AIDS virus grows in chimpanzees, gibbons and rabbits. A similar    virus
grows in baboons, macaques and the African green monkey. "But    unless you
infect yourself with their blood, the chance of infection    from these animals
is negligible," says Thomas J. Kindt of the    National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Md.        Feline leukemia and certain diseases
of goats and horses are, like    AIDS, immunodeficiency diseases. "But none of
these viruses can grow    in human cells," Kindt says.

 You can't get AIDS simply by working or going to school with someone    who has
AIDS.



   No case of AIDS is known or suspected to have been spread by    children in
schools or day-care centers.

     But what if blood from an infected child somehow comes in contact    with
an uninfected child's open wound? Infection is still highly    unlikely.
Scientists know this from doctors and nurses accidentally    exposed to the
virus.

     Even with direct inoculation - doctors and nurses accidentally    sticking
themselves with an infected needle - the AIDS virus seldom
follows. One estimate puts the chance of infection from such a
direct-inoculation accident at one in 286 (New England Journal of    Medicine,
Aug. 4, 1988).

     The household studies show the safety of casual contact among    adults. No
household members, except children born to infected mothers,    sexual partners
of patients or people with other risks, got the virus.

 No evidence anywhere in the world shows casual transmission of AIDS at
school or work.

 You can't get AIDS simply by visiting an infected person's home.



   After all the other evidence we've mentioned, this should be    obvious. But
it isn't to everyone. At least 11 household studies show    that there is no
risk whatsoever from living with an AIDS patient -    even for long durations -
let alone visiting one (American Journal of      Epidemiology, August 1988).

 You can't get AIDS from having sex with someone who isn't infected.



   Really, you can't.

     Groups at highest risk include homosexual and bisexual men and
intravenous drug abusers from big cities; hemophiliacs; female    prostitutes;
heterosexuals from Haiti and central Africa where AIDS is    common; and
recipients of multiple blood transfusions from areas where    AIDS was common
between 1983 and 1985.

     Despite what you may have heard, the AIDS virus is relatively hard    to
get sexually. Part of the reason is that the virus isn't easily    transmitted
in a single or few exposures.

Poll reveals ignorance about AIDS

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A10

LENGTH: 360 words

DATELINE: WINNIPEG, Manitoba


   WINNIPEG (CP) - Fear and ignorance about AIDS are widespread in Canada,
according to a new poll.

Nine in 10 Canadians believe AIDS could spread and affect everyone, not just
known high-risk groups, the poll indicates.

And eight in 10 think new immigrants should be tested for the deadly acquired
immune deficiency syndrome, for which no cure is known. Transmitted by the
exchange of bodily fluids like blood and sperm, the disease disables the immune
system, leaving the body prey to other disease.

Transfusion fear

Released late last week, the Southam News-Angus Reid poll of 1,507 adults
between Nov. 26 and Dec. 4 found:

* 86 per cent felt AIDS could affect them but only 14 per cent had changed their
sexual behavior.

* Eight in 10 fear getting AIDS from a blood transfusion. The risk of doing so
is put at less than one in 10 million.

* Almost half worry about getting AIDS from food prepared and served by someone
with AIDS, or by visiting a doctor or dentist who has treated an AIDS patient.
No evidence exists to suggest this is possible.

* One-third believe a person can get AIDS in a public swimming pool. Experts say
this is impossible.

* Almost three in 10 think you can get AIDS in public washrooms or from
co-workers with AIDS. Again, experts say this is impossible.

* 60 per cent say information campaigns should stress safer sexual activity,
while one-third say the emphasis should be on avoiding promiscuity.

* Two-thirds think mandatory AIDS testing of high-risk groups including new
immigrants, intravenous drug users, homosexuals and prison inmates is justified
because the disease is so serious.

Official dismayed

"I am dismayed to see that we still have misconceptions abounding in the land,"
said Dr. Alastair Clayton, director-general of the federal AIDS Centre in
Ottawa.

Reid, the pollster, noted that as many as one-quarter of those age 18-34
admitted changing their sexual behavior due to the AIDS threat.

The latest World Health Organization figures show almost 70,000 AIDS cases
worldwide. As of Dec. 7, 1,405 cases of AIDS had been reported in Canada. Of
these, 675 are still alive.

Foreign aid buys votes

BYLINE: Patricia Adams And Brady Yauch, Financial Post

SECTION: FP COMMENT; Pg. FP11

LENGTH: 773 words


Foreign aid, for decades used by despotic governments to line their pockets and
finance uneconomic projects, is now being used by democratically elected
governments to buy votes and remain in power.

That's the message from a recent study by Ryan S. Jablonski, an assistant
professor at the London School of Economics and Political Science, in a study
titled, "How Aid Targets Votes: The Impact of Electoral Incentives on Foreign
Aid Distribution." By combining newly available electoral data with foreign aid
data, Jablonski shows that "electoral biases influence aid spending in many, if
not most, aid-dependent states."

Examples abound. In Zimbabwe, citizens looking for food aid before the 2005
election were turned away if they couldn't prove they were supporters of Robert
Mugabe's African National Union-Patriotic Front. In Ethiopia, shortly before the
2010 election, the government of Prime Minister Meles Zenawi reportedly held
back the distribution of foreign aid - agricultural supplies and food aid - from
families that failed to vote for his party, the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary
Democratic Front. And in Pakistan, foreign emergency relief offered in the wake
of flooding in 2010 was allegedly withheld from opposition strongholds.

This latest abuse of foreign aid follows the West's trend over the last two
decades to tie aid to democratic reforms. More and more, poor countries are
holding elections to qualify for foreign aid.

The problem, according to Jablonski, is that donor countries often "lack
information about who is most deserving of aid funds" and so delegate that
responsibility to recipient governments, who then take advantage of the windfall
by delivering those funds to voters most likely to keep them in office.

In Kenya, where Jablonski mined aid and electoral data, this model worked along
ethnic lines, with incumbent political parties using the foreign aid money at
their disposal to help their own - or allied - ethnic groups within the country.

Looking at the three different ethnic coalitions that have led the country since
1992 (Moi's Kalenjin, Kibaki's Kikuyu, and Odinga's Luo tribes), Jablonski shows
that during their time in power, communities within each ethnic group - or in a
coalition with them - received an above average, per capita amount of aid. When
they were no longer in power, the reverse was true.

And while Jablonski uses Kenya as the chief testing ground for his hypothesis,
he points to other developing countries - including Zimbabwe, Ethiopia, the
Philippines and Pakistan - where governments have reportedly used foreign aid
funds for political ends.

Delegating responsibility for aid distribution to poor governments, he
concludes, "has perverse consequences" since "their first priority is to remain
in power."

While donors often talk about accountability when it comes to the use of their
aid money, Jablonski says they "often lack the ability - or willingness - to
distinguish between the neediest and the most politically expedient recipients."
After all, the aid donors aren't up for re-election.

Needless to say, the use of foreign aid for pork barrel shouldn't surprise aid
officials. More robust democracies anticipate such abuses and have laws to
expose and stop them. Not so in the opaque world of foreign aid where donors and
recipient governments share an interest in turning a blind eye to abuses.

Aid agencies are loathe to admit that their aid is used corruptly or for
political patronage: They fear ruffling diplomatic feathers, undermining public
support for foreign aid at home, and revealing their failure to help lift the
poor out of poverty. Better to see no evil. Indeed, as Jablonski points out,
donors may even prefer the candidate who is using their funds to secure power.

Many experts liken aid to the "resource curse," whereby foreign aid - like oil
wells or diamond mines - allows governments to be independent of their people by
increasing the availability of public funds. Jablonski raises this issue, too:
"governments may be less likely to collect taxes and more willing to divert
public funds toward political supporters. These effects may jointly reduce the
accountability of governments to voters by breaking the link between
accountability and revenue and increasing the cost of mobilizing against the
government." Aid agencies brought in democratic reforms in the 1990s when they
realized that dictatorships didn't lend themselves to development. Now they are
coming to realize that foreign aid itself may undermine democracy.

Ten Reasons Not to Miss This Year's Aid Conference

LENGTH: 903  words

DATELINE: New York


Asia Society has issued the following news release:

We held our first Australasian Aid Conference a year ago. In fact, we called it
a workshop, because we thought it would be a rather small affair. Instead, we
got 50 papers and 250 participants, and we're doing it again this year, from
February 12-13 at Australian National University (ANU) in Canberra, again
co-hosted with The Asia Foundation, and again bringing you the best and latest
research from Australia and the region on aid and international development. If
you haven't registered yet, you're running out of time to click here. We had to
close registrations last year due to capacity constraints, and there's every
chance we will have to do so again this year. Meanwhile, if you're still
wondering whether to go, here are ten reasons why you should.

Tanya Plibersek. Last year we had Julie Bishop foreshadow the Coalition's new
aid policy. This year it will be Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs and Deputy
Opposition Leader Tanya Plibersek's turn to set out whether Labor is going to
oppose the new aid cuts, and more broadly what the Opposition's thinking is on
aid and the Pacific.
    Find out why China is setting up the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.
The most controversial development issue of 2014 was China's establishment of
its own regional bank, and the opposition to that decision from the U.S, Japan,
Australia and Korea. Zhou Qiangwu, director of China's Asia-Pacific Finance and
Development Center is a senior adviser to the Chinese government on the AIIB and
other international development issues. He is in a unique position to provide a
better understanding on China's perspective on the AIIB and will be delivering a
plenary address at the conference.
    Debate whether aid has a future. The conventional wisdom is that it doesn't,
but Robin Davies, Devpolicy's associate director, disagrees. He'll be presenting
his heterodox arguments at a conference plenary.
    And discover the future beyond aid. Whether or not aid has a future, there's
growing interest in impact investment, which combines profit-seeking investments
that generate financial return and social impact. Our after-dinner speaker,
Kylie Charlton, is co-founder of Unitus Capital, which raises capital for
entrepreneurial businesses benefiting those at the bottom of the economic
pyramid. Be inspired by her stories, and learn more from GRM's Alwyn Chilver on
impact investing and the future beyond, during one of our parallel sessions.
    Listen to those who receive aid. As Roger Riddell reminded us at last year's
aid conference, too often aid debates and analysis are dominated by residents of
the countries that give aid. This year The Asia Foundation is bringing us a
special plenary session with senior developing country officials responsible for
aid management on the changing aid landscape. We'll also hear from Annalisa
Prizzon from the Overseas Development Institute on her work on this subject, and
about a special survey that Devpolicy has carried out among developing country
aid officials.
    Get the lowdown on aid from India. We've been hearing a lot about aid from
China lately, but what about aid from India? It has a long history and is
growing rapidly. In another plenary organised by The Asia Foundation, speakers
will examine India's aid to Afghanistan, explore India's use of export credits,
and compare Indian and Australian aid.
    Learn what we need to do to fix aid for health. Health was the biggest
beneficiary of the global scale-up of aid over the last decade, so how did the
ebola epidemic happen? Barbara McPake, the new Director of Melbourne's Nossal
Institute and formerly Professor of International Health at Queen Margaret
University, will share her thinking with a plenary address on what needs to be
done to fix aid for health.
    Choose from some 20 parallel sessions featuring 63 papers. The conference
will expose you to the latest and best research from Australia and the region on
aid and international development issues. Session topics include: aid and
governance; aid and health; aid to the Pacific; aid from Asia; aid and public
opinion; aid and security; research and universities; aid and the private
sector; aid effectiveness; migration; disasters and climate change; community
development; and contemporary donor issues. Check out the program here.
    Participate in contributed sessions on aid policymaking, the history of
Australian aid, justice reform, and aid and conflict in Asia's frontiers. Most
of the papers presented in the parallel sessions are invited, but you can also
participate in one of our special contributed sessions.
    Network with more than 200 other academics and NGO, private and government
aid practitioners. It's not just the ideas, it's also the contacts. The
conference is a good chance to meet and chat with others with similar interests
and passions. Who knows where it might lead.

Stephen Howes and Jonathan Pryke from the Development Policy Centre, Joel Negin
from The University of Sydney, and Anthea Mulakala, The Asia Foundation's
director for International Development Cooperation, are the co-conveners of the
2015 Australasian Aid Conference. The views and opinions expressed here are
those of the individual authors and not those of The Asia Foundation.

Do we need foreign aid to transform this country?

BYLINE: Alex Thomas Ijjo -1

LENGTH: 675  words


President Museveni's assent to the "Anti-Homosexuality" Bill sparked off a
debate with a spin-off into the old 'foreign aid' controversy. Concerns relating
to the threat of aid cuts by Western countries are rife.

In response to these concerns, I wish to underscore that foreign aid must never
be made to become a substitute for our domestic responsibility to mobilise
resources to invest in the country and the people. Although foreign aid can be
useful, it has notoriously been characterised by a high level of volatility
based on donor whims but also, unfortunately, predatory local financial
impropriety.

As I write, there is a spate of aid cuts in reaction to the legislation. How far
are these latest developments likely to go? My prediction is that there is
likely to be a shift in Uganda's aid portfolio from unconditioned budget support
to direct project support overseen by agencies from the same countries. The
Netherlands is reported to have frozen $9.6 million to Uganda's Judiciary so as
not to facilitate what they see as restrictive legislation, while Denmark is
redirecting its aid from government to project support and the US and other
Western countries are reviewing their aid folders to Uganda.

These developments are actually an opportune moment to critically reflect on the
role of aid in the economic transformation of countries. While the Marshall Plan
on which foreign aid is modelled, might have acted as a silver bullet in the
reconstruction of post-war Europe, how important is aid to the development of a
country? Is aid indispensable or is it over-rated? What has been the empirical
record of aid in low income economies?

It is important to underscore the fact that while aid can help, its usefulness
to the recipient country depends on many critical factors including 1) the
degree of concessionality, 2) the terms and conditions of the aid, 3) possible
ulterior motives that may be camouflaged in the aid package, but more
importantly, 4) how the aid money is used by the recipient country. It matters
greatly how the aid money is used by the recipient country. This is why
combating corruption is an important game changer.

Another critical dimension is the composition of the aid portfolio - namely the
proportion of commercial, concessional and grant elements of the aid and the
associated conditionality. In general, conditionality is aimed at restricting
fungibility. Tying aid, however, is a double-edged sword. While it can restrict
abuse of aid resources, it may also restrict the latitude for justifiable
discretion in the use of the money. Although much of Uganda's aid portfolio has
comprised grants and concessional loans, any misappropriation can have negative
cost-benefit implications that will hold our unsuspecting posterity to ransom.

Uganda's official policy stance and debt sustainability strategy is to minimise
indebtedness by opting for concessional aid, particularly grants and low
interest loans. In the last budget, the minister of Finance reported that we now
fund 80 per cent of the budget. This is a good trend based on a good debt
strategy and going forward, the country must make up its mind to positively
transform and achieve Vision 2040 with or without foreign aid.  Hopefully,
Uganda will soon be able to wean itself off aid with the advent of petroleum. I
wish to emphasise, however, that our 'ownership' of our country's development
process is the acute prerequisite for successful development, which must
primarily proceed from inside-out. Thus, what we do ourselves here in Uganda is
key, aid on the other hand, is just the icing on the cake.

Drawing on the prevailing state of wisdom on the subject, aid will only benefit
a recipient country when the country has an accountable developmental
government, sound policy framework and the ability to choose an aid portfolio
that is favourable and aligned to the country's development strategy.

Foreign aid: how much does Australia spend now?

BYLINE: Helen Davidsontheguardian.com

LENGTH: 1090 words

ABSTRACT

The Coalition today announced a cut to foreign aid of $4.5bn over four years.
How much does the country spend now? Get the data

FULL TEXT

How much does Australia spend on foreign aid?

In 2012, Australia reported spending $5.4bn ([#xfffd]3.2m) on official
development assistance (ODA), making it the eighth-largest aid donor in the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) group of rich
countries, and just ahead of Sweden ($5.2bn). As a percentage of gross national
income (GNI), Australia seems far less generous and was closer to reaching the
international target to spend 0.7% of GNI on aid in the 1960s and 70s than it is
today. Charities point out that foreign aid accounts for just 1.4% of
Australia's federal budget and that it has suffered disproportionately from cuts
and deferrals in recent years.

Where does the money go?

The bulk of Australian aid is focused on Asia and the Pacific, with Indonesia
and Papua New Guinea the top two recipients. Last year the government announced
it would spend A$375m of aid money on asylum-seekers in Australia instead of on
overseas development projects. Critics pointed out that the decision would make
Australia the third-largest recipient of its own foreign aid. However, while the
announcement marked a significant change in Australia's approach, OECD rules
allow donors to count some in-country refugee costs as ODA; several - including
the Netherlands, Canada and Sweden - already do so. Australia reported zero
in-country refugee costs as aid in 2011 and $5.5m in 2010.

Why has Australian aid been in the news recently?

Anti-poverty groups are up in arms over recent government decisions to delay
planned increases to the aid budget and to divert more aid to PNG as part of
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd's plan to send every asylum seeker who arrives in
Australia by boat to PNG for processing and, possibly, resettlement. The
government's August economic statement said costs associated with the plan would
be "offset from a reduction in AusAid's budget" and that PNG would receive an
extra A$420m in aid over four years, on top of the A$500m it receives each year.
The Australian council for international development said the move went against
the government's advice from its 2010 independent review, which found that PNG
was not a good candidate for aid expansion. They also called for the cessation
of using the foreign aid budget to pay for enacting asylum-seeker policies.

We are nearing an election - what are the parties' positions on aid?

This week, Julie Bishop said the Coalition's foreign policy focus would be on
economic diplomacy, promoting the economic interests of Australia and Australian
businesses. International engagement, including aid, would be led by the
department of foreign affairs and trade. The goal of AusAid, said Bishop, should
be to transform relationships between Australia and recipients of its aid into
"sustainable economic partnerships", and a signature policy would be a plan to
help Australian students live, study, and intern in the Asia and Pacific region.
In its policy document Real Solutions, the Coalition says it will ensure future
aid funding increases "are dependent on AusAid meeting strict performance
benchmarks". Labor has said little about its aid and development priorities
going into the election. "It could be some time after the election before it is
clear what the incoming government will do with the aid programme," says Robin
Davies, associate director of the Development Policy Centre at Australian
National University. Picking priorities for the G20 development agenda, which
Australia will lead from December 2013, will be an early task.

What is the government's record on aid?

The government earned praise in 2010 for commissioning the first independent
review of Australia's aid programme in 15 years and for making AusAid an
executive agency. The year before, the government overturned restrictions on
spending aid money on sexual and reproductive health services, introduced under
the previous administration. AusAid has also expanded Australian presence and
aid programmes in Africa. In 2011, the country became the fourth major aid donor
to publish data to the International Aid Transparency Intitiative (IATI)
registry, after joining a founding member in 2008. More recently, however,
critics have attacked the government's decision to push back planned budget
increases and delay until 2017-18 plans to spend 0.5% of GNI on aid. Observers
have questioned whether this is even possible as, under current plans, the aid
budget would have to grow by A$2bn in 2017-18 alone. Earlier this month, the
foreign minister, Bob Carr, told the Guardian there was no alternative to the
delay in growth because of low government revenue. "You can't run a deficit to
fund recurrent expenditure and foreign aid is recurrent expenditure," he said,
adding that while the trajectory of budget increase has changed "we will reach
the target on the same date." Since 2007, the goal of increasing spending to
0.5% of GNI has been delayed five times - twice in the target date and three
times in trajectory.

Is Australia's aid tied?

In 2006, Australia "untied" most of its aid programme. Before, all Australian
aid-funded contracts, for anything from textbooks to project management, had to
go to domestic companies. Critics say tied aid - sometimes called boomerang aid
- amounts to corporate welfare for companies in rich countries and undermines
development overseas. However, even though most Australian aid contracts are
formally untied and open to competition, the OECD notes that the majority still
goes to Australian companies and that only a fraction of procurements are
undertaken by recipient countries. In 2011, the government committed to
developing stronger links between Australian businesses and the foreign aid
programme and AusAid set up a special unit for domestic companies eyeing aid
-funded business.

Who is Melissa Parke?

Last month, Melissa Parke was announced as Australia's new minister for
international development, the first since 1996. Parke, a lawyer, has worked
with the UN in Kosovo, Gaza, and New York and in 2006 travelled to Lebanon to
help investigate the assassination of former prime minister Rafik Hariri. As
Australian Labor party member for Fremantle, Western Australia, Parke has served
on committees including foreign affairs, defence and trade, and the statutory
committee on human rights. She has been a vocal critic of her government's
asylum policies, as well as on live animal exports.

10 questions on peanuts, sorry, foreign aid

SECTION: FINANCE

LENGTH: 863 words


By Bibek Debroy

Despite the 'they gave the jet to the French when we give them aid' controversy
in Britain, British aid to India, it appears, will continue. In political and
news headline terms, the controversy has died down. But it served the useful
purpose of reminding us of some forgotten questions. We pick the 10 most
important.

1. Does India Need Aid?

This depends, first, on how you calculate per capita income. In exchange rate
dollar terms, India's per capita income varies between $1,000 and $1,110,
depending on rupee-dollar rates. This means India is a lower middle-income
country.

It is also close to World Bank's $1,175 cut off point - countries with per
capita more than that don't qualify for its soft loans and grants. Therefore, it
can be argued India is close to graduating from the needs-aid club. If you take
India's per capita income by purchasing power parity method - around $3,300 -
then the country doesn't qualify for soft loans at all, and is not very far from
a middle-income country status. But there's also the point that there are a very
large number of poor people in India and they don't have access to basics. So,
the next question...

2. Can't India Spend Enough On Its Poor?

Yes, it can. And it's direct and indirect expenditure on poverty alleviation is
huge. But, as everyone knows, delivery and/or bad ideas kill effectiveness. So,
the next question...

Is Foreign Aid

3. More Efficient?

Hardly, as a general experience. There's UNDP data dating 10 years back, which
marked a 30-year high period of foreign aid starting 1970. Total ODA (overseas
development assistance, that is, bilateral aid): $50 billion. Total export loss
to developing countries because of protected farming in rich countries: $50
billion. Total cost of propping up rich country farming: $500 billion.

Trade would have been better than aid. There's also the question of tied aid -
we give you money for a project or to facilitate a policy change, and you buy
from our companies and/or hire our consultants, also known as 'experts'. When
the US was giving plenty of aid during the Cold War, there were scores of
American 'experts' all over the world.

However, some government aid, like British aid that comes through Department for
International Development (DFID) is known to be good at capacity building.
British aid money is seen by experts as being more effective in India than
American aid, disbursed through USAID. But isn't British aid amount small? So,
the question...

4. Is British Aid Peanuts?

It may not be a nice thing to say, especially since British aid seems to be
somewhat effective, but compared to India's capital flows ($37 billion-plus) and
foreign exchange reserves (nearly $300 billion), the £250 million annual aid is
peanuts. But used well, that money can go some distance in India's poorest
states. So, if little British aid can do more than little good in India, why
link it to defence purchases by India. So, the question...

5. Did Brits Go Nuts?

Sort of. Officially, you don't quite say we give you aid, so you must buy our
stuff. If that line had persisted officially, India probably would have said no
to "peanuts".

Even as a behind-the-door bargain, it was odd for Britain to expect the jet deal
because of £250 million annual aid. As for British taxpayers, it's unfair
perhaps to expect them to make subtle distinctions between high Indian economic
growth and deep Indian poverty, or well-off Indian states and poor Indian
states. But India should probably rethink policies on receiving aid. So, the
question...

6. Does India Have an Aid Policy?

Yes, it does. In 2004, and again in 2006, it said it was not in favour of ODA
that created repayment obligations. In 2003, it said it did not want tied aid.
Bilateral aid is okay from G-8 countries and EU. For non-EU European countries,
aid is acceptable only if it is above $25 million annually. So, we have
shortened the list of donors. As India grows, the list will shorten. But the
list of countries India gives aid to will grow bigger. So, the question...

7. Who Does India Give Aid To?

India gives financial assistance to 23 countries. Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh
get the softest financial assistance. India also has less than purely altruistic
reasons for giving aid, just like Western donors. But Indian private aid is
almost absent, unlike Western private aid. So, the question...

8. Is Private Aid To India Important?

Yes, if you consider what Bill and Melinda Gates' foundation is doing. There's
also Western private aid to many NGOs. Even foreign government aid can be
channelled to NGOs; DFID disburses British aid to NGOs. All foreign
contributions to NGOs have to be cleared under Foreign Contribution Regulation
Act. So, the question...

9. Will India Need Aid For a Long Time?

May be another 10 years or slightly longer, assuming nothing goes seriously
wrong with the economy. So, the question...

10. Will There Be More Aid Controversies?

You bet. As India gets wealthier, the chances of controversy get bigger. An
emerging 'big power' that takes aid? Both rich and poor countries may have
plenty to say about that.

Virtue should be granted its reward;
DEBATE/Instead of reducing foreign aid to an all-time low, donors should target
it at developing world's well -governed countries, argues Joseph Stiglitz

BYLINE: Joseph Stiglitz

SECTION: The Guardian City Page; Pg. 21

LENGTH: 1044 words


FOREIGN aid is at an all-time low.  More than 50 years after the "aid era" began
with the Marshall Plan in 1947, development assistance has tumbled to less than
a quarter of 1 per cent of major donors' GNP, the smallest share ever.

Among the reasons for this drop, one stands out: the assumption that aid does
not work very well.

It is true that aid has been an unmitigated failure under some conditions, but
it has been a spectacular success in others.

A new World Bank report, Assessing Aid, aims to show how development assistance
can be used more effectively, by understanding why aid works well in Bolivia or
Uganda, for example, but has little or no impact in Nigeria or Zambia.

Rather than starting with the question "does aid work?", Assessing Aid begins
with "when does aid work best?" The answer is needed urgently.  Despite great
strides in poverty reduction in the past 50 years, more than a billion people
still live in extreme poverty - on less than $ 1 a day.  Even more lack basic
services such as clean water, sanitation, electricity and schooling.

This new focus on the circumstances under which aid works changes the nature of
the debate.  Rather than arguing for more aid or less assistance, Assessing Aid
suggests that donors should concentrate on providing more effective aid.

Defining effective development has become more complicated in recent years. At
the same time that our aid budgets have diminished, our aspirations for aid have
expanded.  Fifty years ago, development focused on one objective: increasing
gross domestic product.  Today, we set broader goals.  We seek to increase
living standards, improve health and education, and maintain a healthy
environment.  We also want development to be equitable and democratic, so that
all of society can participate in decision-making and all groups can reap the
fruits of development.

Assessing Aid finds foreign aid has the strongest impact on growth in developing
countries with sound policies and institutions - for example, macroeconomic
stability, openness to trade, secure property rights, absence of corruption, to
name a few important ones.  In countries with poor policies - that is, with poor
incentives for production - financial aid has a much weaker impact.  To maximise
poverty reduction, financial aid should favour countries such India, Ethiopia
and Uganda, which are poor and have sound economic policies.  Because nearly 7
per cent of the world's poor live in countries with sound policy environments,
targeting assistance to these countries would have a tremendous impact on global
poverty.

Yet in 1996 donors gave only small amounts of assistance to countries with good
policies.  Reformist countries such as Ethiopia or Uganda received less aid per
capita than poor countries with weak policies. Rather than rushing in alongside
policy reforms, aid seems to taper out as reforms are adopted.

OPPONENTS of foreign aid may argue that Assessing Aid, by exploring how to use
aid more effectively, gives licence to donors to decrease their aid budgets. In
fact, the report encourages donors to contribute more aid where it will have the
most impact.  Increasing aid to countries which can use it effectively has very
real consequences for the poor.  For example, allocating pounds 6 billion in aid
under the current system would lift about 7 million people per year out of
poverty.  But if the same amount of money were targeted at poor countries with
sound economic policies, the number of people to leave the ranks of the poor
would be about 25 million.  In good-policy environments, aid is a high-return
investment which permanently raises income and reduces poverty.

So why don't countries end foreign aid to poor countries with bad policies? One
reason is that donors hope that aid will induce policy reform. Unfortunately,
money has proved to be ineffective in generating reform. Zambia is a typical
example.  Foreign aid increased steadily - reaching 11 per cent of real GDP in
the early 1990s.  Policy, however, got worse throughout this period.  Despite a
series of loans from the World Bank and the IMF, there was no substantial
improvement in policy until a new government came to power in the early 1990s.

The message that aid has the greatest impact in countries with good policies
should not be interpreted to mean that donors cannot or should not help
countries with less than perfect policies.  On the contrary, there is a great
deal the donor community can do to help the poor and to spur reform.

IN THESE difficult environments, effective assistance must encompass more than
just money or projects.  It must also focus on ideas or knowledge creation. The
ideas side of aid is critical for helping countries reform and helping
communities provide most effectively public services such as education, health,
and water.

The challenge for donors is how to design the best combination of money and
ideas for individual countries.

Vietnam is one success story. It initiated a homegrown reform programme in the
1980s. Sweden and the United Nations Development Programme provided policy
advice and by 1998 the poverty rate had fallen to 30 per cent of households from
55 per cent in 1992.

The country's experience is part of a worldwide trend in the 1990s toward
economic reform that has enabled a large number of countries to use financial
assistance to reduce poverty.  It is tragic that the volume of aid is declining
at precisely the time that the environment for effective aid is improving. On
the other hand, it remains true that donors could do a better job of allocating
aid.

Aid cannot accomplish goals by itself.  It can only help governments and
societies to pursue their objectives. Even the best designed assistance cannot
succeed if it is being given to governments indifferent to, or incapable of,
helping the poor.

But aid can spur development.  When aid is used to champion reform at the local
and national level, to create the knowledge necessary for effective development
and to engage civil society in the reform process, it can improve dramatically
the lives of the poor.

Virtue should be granted its reward;
DEBATE/Instead of reducing foreign aid to an all-time low, donors should target
it at developing world's well -governed countries, argues Joseph Stiglitz

FOREIGN aid is at an all-time low.  More than 50 years after the "aid era" began
with the Marshall Plan in 1947, development assistance has tumbled to less than
a quarter of 1 per cent of major donors' GNP, the smallest share ever.

Among the reasons for this drop, one stands out: the assumption that aid does
not work very well.

It is true that aid has been an unmitigated failure under some conditions, but
it has been a spectacular success in others.

A new World Bank report, Assessing Aid, aims to show how development assistance
can be used more effectively, by understanding why aid works well in Bolivia or
Uganda, for example, but has little or no impact in Nigeria or Zambia.

Rather than starting with the question "does aid work?", Assessing Aid begins
with "when does aid work best?" The answer is needed urgently.  Despite great
strides in poverty reduction in the past 50 years, more than a billion people
still live in extreme poverty - on less than $ 1 a day.  Even more lack basic
services such as clean water, sanitation, electricity and schooling.

This new focus on the circumstances under which aid works changes the nature of
the debate.  Rather than arguing for more aid or less assistance, Assessing Aid
suggests that donors should concentrate on providing more effective aid.

Defining effective development has become more complicated in recent years. At
the same time that our aid budgets have diminished, our aspirations for aid have
expanded.  Fifty years ago, development focused on one objective: increasing
gross domestic product.  Today, we set broader goals.  We seek to increase
living standards, improve health and education, and maintain a healthy
environment.  We also want development to be equitable and democratic, so that
all of society can participate in decision-making and all groups can reap the
fruits of development.

Assessing Aid finds foreign aid has the strongest impact on growth in developing
countries with sound policies and institutions - for example, macroeconomic
stability, openness to trade, secure property rights, absence of corruption, to
name a few important ones.  In countries with poor policies - that is, with poor
incentives for production - financial aid has a much weaker impact.  To maximise
poverty reduction, financial aid should favour countries such India, Ethiopia
and Uganda, which are poor and have sound economic policies.  Because nearly 7
per cent of the world's poor live in countries with sound policy environments,
targeting assistance to these countries would have a tremendous impact on global
poverty.

Yet in 1996 donors gave only small amounts of assistance to countries with good
policies.  Reformist countries such as Ethiopia or Uganda received less aid per
capita than poor countries with weak policies. Rather than rushing in alongside
policy reforms, aid seems to taper out as reforms are adopted.

OPPONENTS of foreign aid may argue that Assessing Aid, by exploring how to use
aid more effectively, gives licence to donors to decrease their aid budgets. In
fact, the report encourages donors to contribute more aid where it will have the
most impact.  Increasing aid to countries which can use it effectively has very
real consequences for the poor.  For example, allocating pounds 6 billion in aid
under the current system would lift about 7 million people per year out of
poverty.  But if the same amount of money were targeted at poor countries with
sound economic policies, the number of people to leave the ranks of the poor
would be about 25 million.  In good-policy environments, aid is a high-return
investment which permanently raises income and reduces poverty.

So why don't countries end foreign aid to poor countries with bad policies? One
reason is that donors hope that aid will induce policy reform. Unfortunately,
money has proved to be ineffective in generating reform. Zambia is a typical
example.  Foreign aid increased steadily - reaching 11 per cent of real GDP in
the early 1990s.  Policy, however, got worse throughout this period.  Despite a
series of loans from the World Bank and the IMF, there was no substantial
improvement in policy until a new government came to power in the early 1990s.

The message that aid has the greatest impact in countries with good policies
should not be interpreted to mean that donors cannot or should not help
countries with less than perfect policies.  On the contrary, there is a great
deal the donor community can do to help the poor and to spur reform.

IN THESE difficult environments, effective assistance must encompass more than
just money or projects.  It must also focus on ideas or knowledge creation. The
ideas side of aid is critical for helping countries reform and helping
communities provide most effectively public services such as education, health,
and water.

The challenge for donors is how to design the best combination of money and
ideas for individual countries.

Vietnam is one success story. It initiated a homegrown reform programme in the
1980s. Sweden and the United Nations Development Programme provided policy
advice and by 1998 the poverty rate had fallen to 30 per cent of households from
55 per cent in 1992.

The country's experience is part of a worldwide trend in the 1990s toward
economic reform that has enabled a large number of countries to use financial
assistance to reduce poverty.  It is tragic that the volume of aid is declining
at precisely the time that the environment for effective aid is improving. On
the other hand, it remains true that donors could do a better job of allocating
aid.

Aid cannot accomplish goals by itself.  It can only help governments and
societies to pursue their objectives. Even the best designed assistance cannot
succeed if it is being given to governments indifferent to, or incapable of,
helping the poor.

But aid can spur development.  When aid is used to champion reform at the local
and national level, to create the knowledge necessary for effective development
and to engage civil society in the reform process, it can improve dramatically
the lives of the poor.

Taboos balk AIDS war in Mexico Education, aid lag as cases multiply

BYLINE: By Nancy Nusser STAFF CORRESPONDENT

SECTION: FOREIGN NEWS; Section A; Page 6

LENGTH: 594 words


Mexico City - Fernando Rodriguez Hernandez, with enormous eyes in a skeletal
face, looks like what he is: close to death.

Yet he believes, beyond reason, that if he tries hard enough, he can overcome
the total collapse of his body's immune system.

"The ability to survive is here," he said, touching his chest as he sat on a bed
in a Mexico City hospice for AIDS patients.

Outside Rodriguez's earshot, psychologist Alfredo Hernandez says Rodriguez is in
the final stages of the fatal disease.

Rodriguez is more fortunate than many AIDS sufferers, because he has a place to
stay and a doctor to treat him while he is dying. In Mexico, a conservative,
predominantly Roman Catholic nation where even talk of sex is taboo, the price
of contracting AIDS is often abandonment.

Rodriguez was brought to the privately funded hospice when there was nowhere
else to go. Diagnosed with AIDS last March, he made the rounds of a few
hospitals. "They said, 'With HIV, we won't accept you,' " he said.

Rodriguez's family, which did not recoil at his homosexuality as many Mexicans
do, nursed him for as long as possible. The family finally found the tiny
hospice, one of three for AIDS patients in a city of 20 million people.

The number of Mexicans with AIDS is growing. Some 25,000 are believed to have
AIDS, and as many as 250,000 may be infected with HIV, the virus that leads to
the disease, says CONASIDA, the government agency responsible for AIDS
prevention.

But the government, shackled by conservative sexual and religious attitudes, has
launched only a limited education program to prevent the spread of the disease,
and no program at all to care for those already sick. Virtually no health
services are offered specifically to AIDS sufferers.

A privately funded group, Ser Humano, sponsors the only two Mexico City AIDS
hospices for adults. Another has been created for children, and U.S. and Mexican
AIDS workers are raising money for a fourth.

Government funding for AIDS prevention is about $ 2.5 million a year. Javier
Baez Villasenor, a director of CONASIDA, said the budget covers an educational
campaign and distribution of 5 million condoms a year, mainly to private groups
involved in AIDS prevention.

Efforts to do more usually are stymied by Mexican society's conservatism. Open
homosexuality remains strictly taboo.

Gay activist groups accuse some educational campaigns of using AIDS as a scare
tactic, putting too much emphasis on encouraging abstinence rather than
educating people about safe sex.

For example, one poster printed by a Catholic-funded group shows a youth
standing on the edge of a skyscraper. It reads: "Do you want to jump into the
wind? Abstain from sex. Think about it. You can prevent AIDS."

"People reject the message because it invokes death," said Gustavo Perez, a
member of Mexicans Against AIDS.

In recent weeks, Mexican and U.S. AIDS activists have sent out 10,000
invitations to a benefit to raise money to build a Mexico City AIDS hospice.

Only 100 people sent donations, and at least 10 called back to say they were
angry at being invited to an AIDS event, said Elena Lopez, an AIDS nurse and one
of the activists.

AIDS victims frequently run headlong into fear that accompanies ignorance, AIDS
workers and patients say.

Lopez said that, in her home state of Michoacan, a doctor who treated a man with
AIDS told his family to burn his clothes. "The mother and sister were panicked
about the children," said Lopez, who added that Mexicans are "12 years behind
[the U.S.] in terms of education."

Campaigning to keep AIDS fight alive

BYLINE: Kim Painter

SECTION: LIFE; Pg. 1D

LENGTH: 1320 words

DATELINE: NEW YORK


Mike Grady and his friends from ACT UP Connecticut came to Tuesday's big AIDS
march here with posters bearing the image of a mother embracing her AIDS
-stricken son.

''These are real people,'' Grady said, pointing to the poster. ''This is my
friend Raymond and his mother Ida. He's been living with AIDS for six years now.
He's pretty sick ... She stands by him all the way.''

Also among the 10,000 marchers was a 55-year-old waitress named Lucienne Benard
who spoke with a French accent and walked with others from her Presbyterian
church.  ''We have a young man in our church who died of AIDS just last
Friday,'' she said. ''This is a terrible disease.''

The message of the marchers was clear: AIDS is not a problem that concerns only
gay men and drug abusers or, for that matter, only people with AIDS; when
roughly 1 million people get infected with a deadly virus, more than 220,000 get
fatally ill and more than 140,000 die, their mothers, friends and co-workers
suffer - and everyone ought to care.

But, 11 years into the epidemic, weary activists say that getting people to care
about AIDS remains their toughest job. That's why they're at the Democratic
convention here this week and will be at the VIII International Conference on
AIDS, starting Sunday in Amsterdam. Some will also be at the Republican
convention in Houston next month, blasting George Bush for what they say is his
lack of interest in AIDS.

''I think it's getting harder,'' says Jeff Levy of AIDS Action Council, a
Washington group that works Capitol Hill on behalf of AIDS groups nationwide.
''There's this feeling that we've done AIDS and now we're getting on to the next
disease, the next problem. There are, of course, other diseases that need
attention. But AIDS is still this country's major public health crisis.''

Yet, the activists - both the T-shirted street fighters of ACT UP and suit-
wearing lobbyists like Levy - cannot claim they have not made progress, in
Washington and elsewhere, over the past couple of years.

After years of struggle with the Food and Drug Administration, they've seen
adoption of their ideas for faster drug approval and, subsequently, timely
approval of the anti-HIV drug DDC.

Activists who once shouted from the audience at FDA hearings on AIDS drugs now
sit at the table and join the debate.

Policy makers and researchers at the National Institutes of Health also now
willingly listen to the ideas of the activists.

Even the fact that next week's AIDS conference will be in Amsterdam is a victory
for activists: Harvard University organizers moved the meeting out of Boston to
protest a U.S. law that restricts travel and immigration by HIV- infected
people. Activists enraged by the law promised all-out sabotage of the meeting if
it was not moved.

Because of such successes, advocates for people with other diseases, such as
breast cancer and Alzheimers, have studied the AIDS movement and adopted some of
its tactics.

Yet the AIDS activists seem more pessimistic than ever that effective treatment
for AIDS will come in time to save the lives of those infected already -
including many in the activist corps.

''The sad truth is that we're all very depressed, despondent or dead and our
numbers reflect all that,'' says New York playwright Larry Kramer, who started
AIDS activism with a meeting in his living room in 1981 and gave birth to ACT UP
later in the 1980s. Kramer, who is fighting AIDS himself, allows that activists
have had ''enormous success'' in changing the drug- approval system, but says,
''Now there's nothing in the pipeline to go through the system.''

And, he says, activists who recently took a close look at government AIDS
research will release a report in Amsterdam harshly critical of NIH. Kramer, who
wrote a foreword to the report, says it will reveal an NIH where time and money
are wasted simply because people at the 18 different institutes, centers and
divisions involved in AIDS research don't talk with one another.

''It's heartbreaking,'' Kramer says. ''Not only is there not one person in
charge, there are about 50 people who think they're in charge. It's a mess, a
total, awful mess.''

Activists at the meeting - which will attract more than 9,000 AIDS experts,
including more than 3,200 from the USA - also promise to raise a ruckus over
inattention to women with AIDS, the high cost of some AIDS treatments and, once
again, the U.S. immigration law.

Despite the foreign location, George Bush's name is sure to come up as well.

The president and his health officials have recently come under angry attack,
not only by AIDS activists, but by the National Commission on AIDS, a bipartisan
group appointed by Congress and the White House to monitor the epidemic.
Frustrated members say their calls for a more aggressive AIDS battle have been
virtually ignored by an indifferent administration. The commission's most famous
member, basketball great Magic Johnson, is so fed up he's about to leave the
group.

Bush has made occasional remarks about the need to treat people with AIDS fairly
and compassionately. He's made one speech on AIDS and has had one public meeting
with commission members. And health officials say they're doing their best with
the money available; they point out that federal spending on AIDS has grown
rapidly, from a few hundred thousand in 1981 to more than $ 4 billion this year.

AIDS activists would, of course, like more money for drug and vaccine research,
more money for treatment and more money for prevention. They say the most recent
increases barely keep up with inflation.

But, they say, what they want most is leadership - a president who talks about
AIDS more than occasionally and health officials who demand effective prevention
campaigns and efficient use of AIDS research money.

''Bush is afraid of offending part of his constituency, namely the right wing
groups who are interested in AIDS mostly because of their hatred of people with
AIDS,'' says John James, editor of AIDS Treatment News, a newsletter published
in San Francisco. ''This fear has been crippling the national response since the
beginning of the epidemic.''

AIDS activists have been encouraged by Democratic candidate Bill Clinton. He's
met with AIDS groups and endorsed many of their ideas. Two people with HIV -
including a gay man who works on the Clinton campaign - spoke at the convention
Tuesday night.

But Dan Goldberg, an ACT UP New York member, says, ''It's not as if the
Republicans are the enemy and the Democrats are our friends. There's nothing
going on in Washington, and Washington is not all Republicans.''

The real problem, Goldberg says, is that across the country, ''AIDS still is not
seen as a national issue, the way the economy is.''

And the real fear of AIDS activists is that people who do not know people with
AIDS - who have not lost a son or a friend or a co-worker - will simply become
numb to AIDS statistics, as the numbers inevitably rise.

High-profile protesting

AIDS activists are experts at making headlines. Highlights:

- April 25, 1989: Four protesters seize an office of Burroughs Wellcome Co.,
demanding the company lower the price of its drug AZT. The next September, five
activists protest AZT's cost by chaining themselves to a banister at the New
York Stock Exchange, throwing trading into confusion.

- Dec. 10, 1989: Activists disrupt Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral, throwing
condoms and chaining themselves to pews.

- June 24, 1990: Activists throw paper wads and shout down Health Secretary
Louis Sullivan before thousands attending the International AIDS Conference in
San Francisco.

- Jan. 22, 1991: Chanting protesters interrupt Dan Rather's evening newscast;
CBS goes to black for six seconds.

- Sept. 5, 1991: Seven AIDS activists climb to the roof of the Arlington, Va.,
home of archenemy Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and drape it with a 35-foot condom.

Foreign aid may help U.S. more

BYLINE: REENA SHAH

SECTION: NATIONAL; Pg. 1A

It's one of the smaller expenditures in the United States' budget, but it's one
of the most unpopular.

    Foreign aid.

    Every year, Americans demand its end. Congress fights over it.  People write
angry letters to their lawmakers and newspapers. They can't understand why the
United States gives money to foreign nations when it doesn't have enough to pay
its bills at home.

    "The budget crisis can be eliminated and a lot of our domestic problems
corrected if we stop all the foreign aid," Hazel and Ellsworth Carter of Palm
Harbor wrote recently in a letter to the editor of the St. Petersburg Times.
"Let Japan and Germany support the world "

    "Is there no one in Washington with the courage to stand up and demand the
end of foreign aid?" wrote Bob Delimon of Largo.  "Why is it that we can support
the world but not our own?"

    "How can a government forgive billions owed us by Egypt and Israel while
hounding some of its own citizens who are delinquent in their taxes?" demanded
John Harwood of Clearwater.

    Just what is foreign aid?

    The term itself is a misnomer, because in most cases foreign aid helps the
United States as much as it helps foreign governments.  Moreover, aid often
actually is a loan that will be repaid with interest.

    "People have this mistaken idea that every year, Congress sits and writes a
check for so many millions of dollars and gives it to foreign governments," says
Charles Sykes, director of CARE, an international relief agency in Washington,
D.C. In fact, the only nation that has a free hand in deciding what to do with
its money is Israel, which gets a $ 1.2-billion cash grant every year as
economic aid.

    Most of the other foreign aid money will be spent in America, buying food
and weapons from U.S. companies to be sent overseas.  And the rest will come
back because it's given in the form of credit to buy American goods.

    The foreign aid program is designed to win this country friendships and
business deals.

    This year, Congress sat down to design an aid package for 1991 that reflects
budget cuts as well as the post-Cold War world order.  But the bill it finally
agreed on is barely different from those of years past:

    As usual, there's more money in the $ 15.4-billion bill for foreign nations
to buy weapons than to help their poor.

    There are billions of dollars for well-to-do nations like Israel and Egypt
and a few million for impoverished countries.

    America's global interests rather than the poverty of foreign nations
determine who gets aid. "All forms of assistance are allocated in the context of
their contribution to the promotion of U.S. interests in a region or country,"
says an administration booklet explaining the workings of foreign aid.

    This year, nations that break the economic embargo against Iraq won't get
American aid, and population aid can't be used for abortions, even if abortion
is legal in the recipient country.  Economic aid can't be used to train people
or make products that the U.S. also sells on the world market.

    "Nowhere in the world is foreign aid allocated according to need," said
Gezahegne Bekele, a specialist on foreign aid at the General Accounting Office,
the investigative arm of Congress. Most aid from the United States and other
wealthy nations generally goes to allies and better-off nations in the Third
World because they have a greater likelihood of paying back loans and their
higher incomes make them attractive as future importers, Bekele said.

    "The benefits don't go just to the recipients. We benefit too," said Bekele.
"Sometimes we benefit more than they do."
 Who gets what


   An examination of the foreign aid bill for the coming year reveals how
America's foreign aid policy works.

    Only $ 2.8-billion will go to underdeveloped nations through programs that
vaccinate children, improve agriculture, fight AIDS and the like. Most of these
programs are tied to the purchase of American-made products or are given through
U.S. relief groups and universities.

    In contrast, $ 4.6-billion will be given to allies in the form of military
aid. In the 1970s and early 1980s, most military aid was given in the form of
loans, but as the debts of recipient nations have grown, military aid has been
switched back to grants. Nearly all this amount will be divided among six
nations: Israel, Egypt, Turkey, Greece, Morocco and El Salvador.

    In addition to military aid, more than $ 3-billion of economic aid will go
in cash and discounted imports to allies to help balance their budgets and boost
their economies. Israel and Egypt will get two-thirds of this economic aid. The
rest will go to the Philippines, Jordan, Morocco, Cyprus and Lebanon.

    Another $ 1.5-billion will be spent on food aid. But most food aid is in the
form of cheap, long-term loans to allies such as Egypt and Morocco to enable
them to afford food imports. An additional $ 2-billion will pay America's dues
to international organizations such as the United Nations and the World Bank.
The remaining $ 1.5-billion will finance the Peace Corps, the State Department's
supervision of foreign aid and give additional credit to buy U.S.  exports.

    As part of the nearly $ 4-billion Israel will ultimately get in military aid
and cash, it will get $ 45-million to resettle the 150,000 Soviet and East
European Jews expected to emigrate in 1991. Israel also has received a $
400-million loan guarantee to build housing for its new immigrants. By contrast,
the 300,000 Cambodian refugees who still are in camps in Thailand will get $
5-million.



   Ireland, a European Economic Community member whose per capita income is more
than $ 6,000 a year, gets $ 20-million a year, even though some congressional
members this year pondered the wisdom of this expense at a time of budgetary
constraints.  According to a State Department official, who spoke only on
condition he not be identified, that amount was first allocated by Tip O'Neill
before he retired as Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives and is
earmarked by Congress every year.

    "It's sometimes hard to explain to developing countries why we give aid to
Ireland," the State Department official said. "It represents a special desire of
some legislators."

    Every year, the president submits a budget request for foreign aid, listing
how much he would like to give to various nations. But Congress has the final
say. Administration officials complain that 80 percent of foreign aid is
earmarked by Congress, reserving aid for congressional favorites and depriving
the State Department of a valuable foreign policy tool.

    "It leaves us with very little flexibility to respond to events," a State
Department official said.

    For example, when new governments were installed in Panama and Nicaragua
this year, Congress had to vote a supplemental aid package to those countries,
because almost all aid for 1990 had been earmarked.

    The foreign aid bill even earmarks some direct benefits for Americans. To
pay for schools and hospitals that serve Americans who work overseas, $
29-million has been allocated. The amount equals what the U.S. will spend in
food aid to Mozambique, where a civil war has left half its 16-million people
dependent on food aid.  And $ 1.5-million of economic aid to El Salvador is to
be used by that country to investigate any murders of Americans there. Another $
10-million of economic aid has been set aside this year to cover life and health
insurance and salaries to American hostages in Iraq, Kuwait and Lebanon, and
their families.

    Although the words "foreign aid" indicate Americans give money to others,
that is hardly the case.

    "We say, "Here's $ 100,000 for you to buy a tractor, but buy an American
tractor'," said the GAO's Bekele, explaining how the business of foreign aid
works. America finds a customer, and it gets its money back years later with
interest. "It's not just we who do it everybody does. The Germans, the Japanese,
everybody."

    Although the deal may appear immediately attractive, it can end up being
more costly for the countries that get that aid, especially poor ones.

    "They can probably get a better bargain if they used their own money and
shopped on the world market," Bekele said. But aid is hard to resist. "It may
not be what you need, but there's such a big rebate, you decide to buy it."
Chris Goldthwait, an administrator at the Foreign Agricultural Service, which
oversees America's food aid program, says it is in America's interest to give
aid "because once the economies of these countries register good growth, people
are going to have more money to spend on imports." Goldthwait points to nations
that received American aid once and now import food from it: Japan, South Korea,
Taiwan and Germany.

    "It's a win-win situation," Goldthwait said. "We get a tremendous amount of
goodwill. Our past experience has also shown us that governments get so used to
dealing with us and placing orders that when they graduate as importers, they
come to us."
 Is foreign aid
 really "aid'?


   Foreign aid is becoming more unpopular. A Louis Harris poll in 1986 revealed
one-third of Americans opposed giving aid to other nations. This year, a poll
found half of all Americans against the program.

    America's own problems, like increasing homelessness, the savings and loan
crisis and cuts in domestic social services programs, have made people question
Washington's eagerness to help outsiders.

    "There's a sense that a lot of aid doesn't end up with people in need and
that it's just cash given to corrupt governments," said Marc Cohen, an analyst
at Bread for the World, a Washington group that advocates humanitarian aid.

    In the past, American aid "was based on Cold War considerations," Cohen
said. "If a government was anti-communist, we gave it aid, no matter how they
treated their own people. It was our money that kept dictators like Marcos and
Duvalier and Somoza in power."

    Others say America's foreign aid program hasn't worked because it has
pursued its own short-term military goals rather than the long-term goal of
helping people become self-sufficient.

    The United States especially has used food aid as a weapon, delaying
supplies to governments it wants to destabilize, said Jack Shepherd, author of a
book on aid to Ethiopia and a professor at Dartmouth College. Food supplies to
Zimbabwe were withheld when a junior government official embarrassed President
Carter during a 1977 visit by criticizing America's support of South Africa,
Shepherd said. And food aid was deliberately delayed to Ethiopia during the
1984-85 famine when 1-million Ethiopians died. The Reagan administration hoped
that lack of food would provoke the overthrow of Ethiopia's communist
government, which still is in power.

    "It hasn't helped us at all," Shepherd said of the use of food as a weapon.
"It's only made people hostile to us. Even when we give something like food,
they're suspicious because they think there's some catch to it."

    Despite billions of dollars poured into the Middle East, Americans are still
hated and targeted for terrorist attacks.

    "All it's done is made Egypt and Israel depend on us for that $ 5-billion
every year," Shepherd said. "It's totally ruined Egypt's capacity to feed
itself, and it hasn't helped us at all. We've been giving billions and billions
of dollars, but there's no peace in the Middle East."

    Other critics say America's aid programs subsidize U.S.  corporations,
draining taxpayers' dollars and hurting the poor in countries that get aid. For
example, millions in aid money has been loaned to American companies to set up
businesses in the Caribbean that export exotic fruits like passion fruit to
America, said Kathy McAfee, an official of Oxfam America, a private relief
agency.

    In other instances, governments are told they will get aid if they cut
spending on health or education. But they're also advised to spend more to make
their countries attractive for American investors.

    "They're constructing factories," McAfee said. "They're laying water pipes
and building power plants for American businesses, but they're told to stop
spending on schools and hospitals. It makes people very resentful."

    Although many Americans are disillusioned with foreign aid, individually
they are generous givers. Private contributions to churches and relief agencies
that have overseas programs add up to $ 12-billion every year nearly six times
more than the U.S.  government spends on the world's poor.

    "People like the idea of helping the needy. There's a general acceptance of
the fact that as a rich nation, America should help the poor and needy of the
world," said a State Department official who spoke only on condition of
anonymity. But Americans oppose the idea of their tax dollars going to foreign
governments, he said.  "People know about leaders like Mobutu and Marcos and in
their mind, they have a picture of greedy, corrupt rulers with mansions in
Switzerland. It's a pretty powerful image that stays with people."

    The amount of foreign aid Americans give has declined over the years, and is
a fraction of what they gave to Western Europe through the Marshall Plan after
World War II. At that time, Americans gave $ 3 of every $ 100 of their gross
domestic product for foreign aid, according to a report of the Congressional
Research Service. Now they give about 25 cents.

    The United Nations recommends wealthy nations give at least 70 cents of
every $ 100 of gross domestic product in aid to poor nations.

    "We spend less as a percentage of our national revenue than most western
democracies do," the State Department official said, adding that nations like
Sweden, Britain and Italy give far more.  "We're routinely criticized quite
brutally in gatherings in Paris of democracies for being too miserly."

    Japan, once a receiver of American aid, now is the world's largest giver of
economic aid, spending nearly $ 9-billion compared to America's $ 8-billion.

    "We can look at the problem (of giving foreign aid during financial
difficulty) from a domestic point of view and come up with all kinds of
misgivings," the State Department official said.

    "Or we can be a team player along with the European democracies and the
Japanese. There's no question that foreign aid has helped sustain America's
status as a powerful nation."

Foreign aid is a billion-dollar business. And a lot of our aid is outsourced to
a billion-dollar businessman. Matt Wade reveals how 80 per cent of Australian
aid money stays in local hands.

MULTIMILLION-dollar contracts, consultants on six-figure salaries,
super-technical projects, Australia's richest man and needy citizens of the
poorest countries in the world. This curious blend of people and processes is
part of the Government's effort to help the world's poor.

Billionaire Kerry Packer has become a significant player in the Commonwealth's
$1.76 billion overseas aid program through a company called GRM International.
The firm owned by Consolidated Pastoral Company, the pastoral division of
Packer's Consolidated Press Holdings had contracts to implement Australian aid
projects worth more than $142 million in 2000-01, according to official figures.

GRM International was one of an elite group of 10 companies with $1.2 billion
worth of contracts from the Australian Agency for International Development
(AusAID) that year.

AusAID which administers the Government's aid program conducts most of its
international development assistance through specialised businesses. To do this
it dishes out more than 1000 aid contracts to Australian firms each year, and at
any one time it has about 1800 contracts worth $2.5 billion in operation.

AusAID is the Commonwealth's third-largest buyer of outside services behind the
Department of Defence and Centrelink. The aid contracts cover a range of
economic development activities including public health, education, agriculture,
institutional development and infrastructure projects. It is technically complex
work often carried out in difficult Third World locations but it can be highly
profitable.

The prospect of winning a swag of lucrative AusAID contracts, some worth more
than $50 million, has spawned this unique aid management business. Aidwatch, a
non-profit organisation that monitors Australia's aid spending, estimates 71 per
cent of the taxpayer-funded program is delivered through private companies.

A further 20 per cent is channelled through international institutions like the
World Bank and Asian Development Bank (ADB). Australia's biggest aid consultants
pick up more work funded in part by the Australian Government through these
organisations. Packer's GRM International, for example, has nine contracts with
the ADB and one with the World Bank, on top of the 17 aid contracts it has with
the Federal Government.

In contrast, about 100 voluntary organisations like World Vision and
Oxfam/Community Aid Abroad will compete for less than $100 million of official
aid project money this year.

AusAID figures on business participation in the aid program in 2000-01 showed a
Melbourne-based company called ACIL Australia was the largest government
contractor, with 27 projects totalling $354 million. The South Australian firm
SAGRIC International was next with 20 contracts worth $209 million, followed by
Packer's GRM International, which is based in Brisbane (SAGRIC's sister firm
Coffey MPW got another $38 million).

Other big players include SMEC International, a privately owned spin-off from
the Snowy Mountains Scheme, the Overseas Projects Corporation of Victoria and
International Development Support Services, owned by Oxfam/Community Aid Abroad.

Private companies have always played a big role in overseas aid delivery, and
advocates for the system say specialised project management firms are the best
equipped to manage Australia's complex aid projects.

David Guy, market analyst for SMEC International, believes his firm has
developed the essential capabilities required to deliver aid successfully: "Aid
requires a unique blend of skills, especially an ability to perform technical
tasks in unfamiliar

cultural environments. Companies like SMEC can perform a useful project
management function by combining specialist expertise with an understanding of
the needs and requirements of international agencies."

AusAID claims that using private firms gives its projects access to the latest
specialist expertise, ensures value for money through competitive tendering and
lifts the profile of Australian companies and experts. There is no formal code
of conduct for these contractors, but AusAID reserves the right to assess the
financial viability of tenderers and to conduct snap audits. Australian aid
contracts are restricted to firms with headquarters in Australia or New Zealand.

AusAID says 80 per cent of official aid is spent on Australian goods and
services, creating jobs and giving local firms a boost. But the system has its
critics. Aidwatch questions whether business should be among the biggest
beneficiaries of the taxpayer-funded overseas aid effort. The group's
spokeswoman, Melita Grant, says it's an expensive system. "The Australian
Government directs aid to projects that most benefit Australian companies,
rather than those that recipient countries may need most," she says.

The Government's official line is that poverty reduction is the "central
integrating factor" of its aid program but acknowledges that the commercial
benefits to Australia are important.

Also, some insiders believe the competitive tendering system puts pressure on
firms that win contracts to save money by reducing the quality of work as it
proceeds. But an AusAID spokesman says the agency has a rigorous monitoring
system and progressive contract payments are dependent on satisfactory progress.

Those who own private aid consultancies including the Packers are not the only
Australians doing well out of AusAID contracts. An army of experts,
subcontracted by the project management firms to implement aid work, are paid
healthy fees for their services.

One experienced aid subcontractor who has worked on a number of AusAID-funded
projects says it is routine for half the project budget to be spent on
Australian consultants and related services. "We were on incredible conditions
on one project, my salary was more than the total salary bill for my 70 staff,"
the specialist says. "It makes you wonder whether you were really being
effective."

According to aid industry sources, short-term consultants on AusAID projects
have in some cases received tax-free packages of more than $1500 a day, while it
was typical for more permanent staff to have salaries well in excess of
$100,000, not including accommodation and food.

An AusAID spokeswoman says there is no standard rate for consultants working on
its projects. "The individual prices paid to consultants are the result of a
competitive tendering process, and that means market rates," she says.

Australia is not alone in contracting the lion's share of its aid program to
private firms. The commercialisation of aid is part of a global trend and
successful Australian aid contractors are using the experience gained
implementing AusAID programs to gain a bigger stake in the $56-billion-a-year
international aid industry.

SMEC, established by the Commonwealth Government in 1970 to apply the skills
developed during the Snowy Mountains Scheme and privatised by sale to the staff
in 1993, provides a good example. Having established a strong track record
implementing Australian aid projects during the 1970s and '80s, it graduated to
managing World Bank and Asian Development Bank work and this now accounts for
the bulk of its international business.

"It is fair to say that without the opportunities presented by Australian aid we
would not be in the position we are in today," says Guy. "The Australian aid
program continues to perform this role for Australian companies entering the
international market."

Some firms are also eyeing opportunities in European countries, such as Britain,
which are opening up aid tendering process to non-European firms. ACIL, the firm
with the most Australian aid contracts, has been short-listed for its first
British funded development project an HIV/AIDS program in Mozambique.

Packer's GRM has used the expertise garnered doing overseas aid projects to pick
up social development contracts with the Australian Government.

So has the commercialisation of aid gone too far? According to Aidwatch, the
stranglehold that private firms have on aid spending is inconsistent with public
backing for the program.

A Newspoll survey last year showed more than 85 per cent of voters support
overseas aid spending for humanitarian and moral reasons, and because Australia
is wealthy and can afford it.

"Australians support overseas aid for reasons pertaining to moral responsibility
rather than self-interest," Grant says. "[But] the Australian aid program is
increasingly being used to support big-business interests under the guise of
philanthropic development assistance."

The Australian Council for Overseas Aid (ACFOA) says more aid money should be
channelled through voluntary aid organisations such as World Vision, Oxfam/CAA
and TEAR Australia. These agencies have a genuine link with the public and, as a
group, received almost $300 million in donations last year, up about 6.5 per
cent. And yet voluntary agencies get less than 7 per cent of the official aid
budget well below the OECD average of 10 per cent.

The executive director of ACFOA, Graham Tupper, says voluntary agencies have
great credibility in the Australian community and many of them are well placed
to reach the poorest of the poor in developing countries. "Many voluntary
organisations provide a cost-effective and sustainable option for delivering
overseas aid specifically targeted to grassroots community programs," he says.

"There is scope for the Australian Government to increase the proportion of
funding going through these organisations." He believes the Government should at
least bring funding for voluntary aid agencies into line with other OECD
countries.

PAYING FOR THE POOR HOW THE NUMBERS LOOK

1. Since 1960, international aid has helped reduce infant mortality rates in
developing countries by 50 per cent, increase life expectancy from 46 years to
63 years, and increase primary school enrolment from 48 per cent to 78 per cent.

2. Global aid spending totalled $56 billion in 1999 - about a tenth of the
annual world arms trade.

3. Only four of the 23 aid donor countries have reached the UN target of
contributing 0.7 per cent of GNP (a measure of national wealth). Australia
contributes 0.26 per cent of GNP ($1.76 billion) and ranks 15th.

4. Australian overseas aid budget has fallen 13 per cent in real terms over the
past two years.

5. The 48 poorest countries in the world (classified by the UN) get only about
11 per cent of Australia's aid. Lower-middle income countries, especially in the
Asia-Pacific region, get 62 per cent.

6. 20 per cent of Australian aid goes to Papua New Guinea while Africa gets less
than 8 per cent (2000-01 figures)

7. The majority of Australia's aid is implemented by business contractors - the
10 biggest had $1.2 billion worth of work in 2000-01.

8. 85 per cent of Australians support overseas aid spending.

9. 50 per cent of Australians claim to have donated money or time to a voluntary
aid agency in the past 12 months.

10. Australians give almost $300 million a year to voluntary overseas aid
organisations (not including the taxpayer-funded Government aid).

HETEROSEXUALS AND AIDS: NEW DATA EXAMINED

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN

SECTION: Section C; Page 1, Column 6; Science Desk

LENGTH: 4154 words


AS the world epidemic of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or AIDS, continues
unabated, a new apprehension has begun to take hold among some medical experts.
They say their suspicion is growing stronger that the disease may now pose a
threat to the heterosexual community, though they hasten to add that this
suspicion is based on preliminary interpretations of figures collected mainly in
Africa and Haiti and on only scant data from the United States. Other health
authorities still contend, however, that the risk to heterosexuals in the United
States is so small that no new public health recommendations are warranted.

At present, the established risk groups are homosexuals, intravenous drug users,
hemophiliacs and Haitians who recently moved to the United States.

Since 1981, when the baffling disease was first recognized in New York and
California, medical researchers have made enormous strides. They have discovered
a virus believed to cause AIDS, and they have begun to unravel some of the
mysteries of the natural history of the affliction that has been diagnosed in 37
countries. Most of the cases have been reported in the United States.

Still, AIDS continues to be marked by confusion, frustration and dread. It is
usually fatal in a slow, agonizing course. There is no effective treatment for
it, and only changes in life style may prevent it. No one has learned why many
who develop evidence of infection from the AIDS virus become ill and die, while
some others do not.

The growing concern has led some experts to issue public warnings that
heterosexuals, like homosexuals, ought to avoid promiscuous sex. Others say the
threat remains too weak to justify the urging of people to change their
behavior.

Doctors quickly discovered that AIDS affected both sexes; the earliest diagnosed
cases in females were among intravenous drug users and Haitian women living in
the United States. Knowledge that the infection could be spread through
heterosexual contact first came from doctors at Montefiore Hospital and the
Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx. They reported in 1983 that
AIDS had developed among seven female sexual partners of male intravenous drug
users who had AIDS.

Initially, some Federal health workers were skeptical because they suspected the
women involved might also be drug users, but now believe heterosexual
transmission of AIDS is occurring in the United States, according to Dr. Harold
W. Jaffe of the AIDS team at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.

However, the number of cases of AIDS believed to have been transmitted
heterosexually in the United States remains small - a total of 59, or less than
one percent of the 7,981 cases reported to the Atlanta centers as of Jan. 21. Of
the 59 cases, all but five were in women and most were among female sexual
contacts of intravenous drug users. Also, of the 59 cases, 50 were reported from
New York, New Jersey, California and Florida, the states where most AIDS is
diagnosed. And the proportion of AIDS cases among heterosexuals compared to all
other risk groups has remained constant.



Equal Sex Ratio in Africa

A recent issue of the Centers for Disease Control's weekly report said that, in
contrast to the experience in the United States, data emerging over recent
months from research in several African countries show an equal sex ratio in
AIDS cases, suggesting that heterosexual transmission may be ''the predominant
mode in the spread of AIDS'' there.

Extrapolation of those findings to the United States population by some health
officials has added a new dimension to the confusion. Many doctors are puzzled
and surprised that so little heterosexual transmission has occurred in the
United States when there is so much in Africa.

Doctors do not yet know for certain if the AIDS virus being spread in Africa, or
the disease it produces, is different from the one causing AIDS in this country.
Studies are trying to determine if bisexual or anal-genital heterosexual
practices are more common in Africa, where contraceptives are not widely
available, and, if so, whether those practices might account for greater
heterosexual spread in Africa compared to the United States and Europe. Nor is
it known whether the only reason heterosexual transmission is not occurring in a
major way in the United States and Europe is because relatively few females are
infected there, and thus the chances of such transmission are low - but just for
now.



High Risk Linked to Promiscuity

So far the data hint that the risk, if it exists for heterosexuals at all, may
be greatest to promiscuous heterosexuals, particularly those who have had sex
with female prostitutes. But Dr. Jaffe said he did not know ''how important
heterosexual transmission of AIDS will become.''

Heterosexuals could now be spreading AIDS, if they are, as a result of the
introduction of the virus from contact with members of such high-risk groups as
drug users, bisexuals and Haitians.

The definition among public health workers of what constitutes promiscuity
varies widely, but generally means frequent sex contacts with many different
people, including prostitutes but not necessarily so.



Mode of Transmission Is Mystery

One of several lingering mysteries of AIDS is its mode of transmission. The
virus has been detected in sperm, saliva and blood. Epidemiological studies
indicate that intimate contact is required to transmit AIDS, and that saliva is
not an important means of spreading the virus except possibly through biting.
According to a major theory, contact with blood contaminated with the AIDS virus
may be necessary before transmission takes place. This may happen routinely in
certain homosexual practices when internal tears result, allowing easier entry
of the virus into the blood system.

Precisely how AIDS virus is spread heterosexually, if it is, is not known.
Researchers theorize that the AIDS virus could enter the blood from sperm
reaching the uterus at certain times in the menstrual cycle, but they are
perplexed in explaining how AIDS virus might be passed into the blood of a male
in heterosexual intercourse. It is not yet known if AIDS virus can pass through
intact cells in the penis, vagina or mouth to enter the blood.

Further, some researchers believe that the AIDS virus is not sufficient to cause
the disease, but requires so-called cofactors, such as repeated infections with
different organisms that affect the immune system, which might make such
individuals more susceptible to AIDS. For example, researchers have noted that
homosexuals have a much higher incidence of bowel and other infectionsCcompared
to heterosexuals and that parasitic diseases are common among Africans. Doctors
are also trying to determine if common vaginal infections enhance the ability of
AIDS virus to cause disease.



Research in San Francisco

In San Francisco, where 502 AIDS cases were reported in 1984, more than double
the 248 cases reported in 1983, AIDS has been almost exclusively a disease of
homosexual men. Of the 885 AIDS cases reported there, 853, or 96 percent, have
afflicted homosexuals and bisexuals.

But in the last year, doctors in San Francisco have diagnosed four cases of AIDS
among heterosexuals who reported no other risk factors. These cases were the
first acquired by heterosexual transmission in that area and more heterosexually
transmitted cases can be expected to occur because of the long incubation period
of the disease, Dr. Dean F. Echenberg of the San Francisco Department of Health
said. Those cases and reports of heterosexual spread in Africa led San Francisco
health officials to issue warnings to the public about the possible risks of
getting AIDS through heterosexual contacts.

''If you have had multiple sexual partners, or your partner has had multiple
sexual partners, since 1978, you should not be sharing body fluids,'' Dr.
Echenberg said.

Thus far, apparently only San Francisco health officials have seen a need for a
warning to heterosexuals who are not in one of the established risk groups and
who are not having sexual relations with anyone who is.

Even so, health officials elsewhere say they are deeply concerned because no one
can rule out the possibility that there will some day be a genuine threat to
heterosexuals not in any of the established risk groups.



Research in New York City

Some researchers in New York also have begun to speak out about the potential of
greater spread of AIDS among heterosexuals. It is their belief that it would be
better to err in alerting the public now about a threat that may never
materialize than to wait until they have confirmation. Early warnings, they say,
are needed because the incubation period of the disease can be up to five years,
far longer than for the overwhelming majority of infectious diseases.

Such ''consequences would be horrendous,'' said Dr. Warren Johnson, a physician
at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center who is studying AIDS in Haiti. ''The
public needs to know that heterosexual transmission going on,'' he said.

Because of the long incubation period, it takes time to move the virus from one
population to another. Current figures ''do not quell my anxiety that it is yet
to come,'' Dr. Johnson said. ''What harm have you done by properly explaining
that problem now compared to being tight lipped?''

Dr. Neal H. Steigbigel of the Montefiore-Einstein team that first reported the
heterosexual spread of AIDS said that ''clearly now it has to be listed in the
group of traditional venereal diseases.'' But, Dr. Steigbigel said, ''the level
of transmission is probably very low and how large a threat it will be remains
to be seen.''

Other public health workers were reluctant to make any broad recommendations
because evidence is lacking that AIDS will ever affect large numbers of
heterosexuals in the United States. Yet they said the public should know about
the new findings and recommended that homosexuals and heterosexuals be prudent
in their choice of sexual partners.



Research in Seattle

Seattle health workers recently issued stringent guidelines aimed at reducing
the risk for AIDS, suggesting that it was now ''unwise for anyone to select a
new sexual partner who has been homosexually active,'' according to Dr. H.
Hunter Handsfield of the University of Washington. ''That implies that women
should not have sex with bisexual men.''

But the Seattle guidelines did not address choice of new partners among
heterosexuals, Dr. Handsfield said, because no case of heterosexually
transmitted AIDS has been reported there and because the data did not warrant
such recommendations. Also, Dr. Handsfield said, ''the fact that in Africa
heterosexual transmission appears to be the rule is not necessarily applicable
in this country'' because so many other factors may be involved in the spread
there.

Dr. Handsfield said he doubted that ''heterosexuals, even relatively promiscuous
ones, would ever have the level of risk for AIDS that gay men do'' because
''there is something special about gay sexuality with respect to disease
transmission.''

Still, Dr. Handsfield said, more heterosexually transmitted cases of AIDS can be
expected to be reported in this country as the epidemic grows but that the
numbers will remain proportionately low compared to those reported in the high
risk groups.



Worst Fears Are Borne Out

The new concerns come at a time when the disease has borne out some of the most
dire predictions about the course it would take. AIDS has now been reported in
46 states. Of the 7,981 reported cases, 3,757, or 47 percent, of the victims
have died. The fatal nature of the disease is made more stark by examining the
cases by date of diagnosis. For cases diagnosed before January 1984, at least 64
percent died, in contrast to 84 percent for cases diagnosed before January 1982.

Because of a lag in sending reports from physicians to local to state health
departments and then to the Atlanta center, the current case count may exceed
9,000.

A better perception of the scope of those who have come in contact with the AIDS
virus is being afforded by a recently developed blood test. It shows that many
more people have developed evidence of infection with the AIDS virus than have
ever shown symptoms from it. Moreover, early test results suggest that many
people may have had AIDS, perhaps a mild form of it, and recovered.

But experts are still not certain whether a positive AIDS blood test in an
asymptomatic individual means that the individual still could come down with the
fatal symptoms in the future, or whether an individual has had exposure to a
virus unrelated to AIDS but that through nonspecific means causes a positive
test.

Early test results suggest that inapparent infection with the AIDS virus may be
30 to 50 times more common than the 7,981 cases of the illness itself. At least
300,000 Americans have already been infected by the AIDS virus, according to
estimates made by Dr. James Curran who heads the AIDS program at the Centers for
Disease Control.



Action on a Number of Fronts

As the issue about heterosexuality has risen there has been action on a number
of fronts:


- A state AIDS task force in California has just offered new grants to stimulate
researchers to study the heterosexual transmission of AIDS, according to Dr.
Merle A. Sande of the San Francisco General Hospital.


- Because studies hint that some males may have contracted AIDS from
prostitutes, other researchers have begun to test blood samples from among
prostitutes and to plan epidemiologic studies to clarify and quantify the risks
of female-to-male transmission and contact with prostitutes.


- Researchers are planning to broaden studies in Africa to include members of
the diplomatic community, Peace Corps workers, nuns and other foreigners. By
comparing the incidence of AIDS in foreigners and Africans, researchers hope to
gain important clues to understanding whether the disease is spread primarily by
sexual contact or by some as yet undetected environmental factor such as insects
bearing the virus.


- Many scientists are widening their concepts of the biological means by which
the AIDS virus is spread, some are testing new ideas, and others are hoping that
animal studies might help clarify questions about the transmission of the virus
through saliva and semen.

''We need to keep our minds open even to big surprises and to follow up on every
lead,'' said Dr. Robert C. Gallo of the National Cancer Institute and a leading
AIDS researcher.

Heterosexual transmission of AIDS has been highlighted to the public
periodically, occasionally through an unusual and powerful anecdotal case
report. One involved two of the oldest victims of AIDS, a Florida couple in
their 70's who had been married for 50 years and who reported monogamy. The wife
apparently caught the disease from her husband, a hemophiliac, one year before
he developed symptoms. The cases hinted that AIDS could be spread heterosexually
and transmitted even before a person showed outward manifestations of the
disease. However, AIDS has been uncommon among female sexual partners of
hemophiliacs.



Research in Africa

The new wave of concern about the heterosexual spread of AIDS has risen
primarily because of reports of numerous cases of the disease in several
countries in Africa. Doctors noted an unusual number of females with AIDS
compared to the experience in the United States.

European and American scientists joined with doctors in Zaire and Rwanda to
study the incidence and pattern of spread. So far, according to Dr. Thomas C.
Quinn of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease in Bethesda,
Md., and Johns Hopkins Medical School in Baltimore, the data indicate that AIDS
is more common in the former French and Belgian colonies in Africa, and less so
in former British colonies. Preliminary data suggest that the incidence of AIDS
in Kinshasha, Zaire, may be as high or higher than in New York or San Francisco,
Dr. Quinn said.

In a study of 38 patients in Zaire, 20 were males and 18 females. The mean age
of female AIDS cases was 28 years, considerably younger than the 41-year mean
for male AIDS cases, according to the report in The Lancet.

In a second study reported in the same issue of The Lancet, in Rwanda, most of
the 17 males with AIDS were promiscuous heterosexuals and 4 of the 9 females
were prostitutes. However, the Belgian, Dutch and Rwandan authors said they
could not rule out contamination during scarification rituals or poor hygienic
practices during medical procedures as possible sources of the infection.



Compelling Evidence in Zaire

In both African studies, homosexuality, drug abuse and blood transfusion did not
appear to be risk factors. The authors of the Zairian study also said that
heterosexual transmission was further implicated by unpublished data about two
clusters of AIDS involving males and females with frequent heterosexual contact.

Such clusters are the most compelling evidence of the possibility of widespread
heterosexual transmission. The reason, AIDS experts say, is that studies of
clusters in New York and California gave the earliest clues to the spread of
AIDS among homosexuals. Analyses of the American clusters also pointed to the
number of sexual partners as a key risk factor for AIDS among homosexuals. Now,
these researchers say, the clusters are pointing to the same phenomenom among
heterosexuals in Africa.

AIDS ''is starting to break out in heterosexuals in the United States but it is
primarily hitting those who are very promiscuous, and that is exactly what we
see in Africa and what initially was the most common risk factor in the
homosexual group in the United States,'' Dr. Quinn said.

Preliminary results of studies in Africa, he said, show that AIDS patients have
about 30 to 40 sexual contacts per year compared to about 10 to 20 in the
control group.

Researchers from the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda , Md., and the
Centers for Disease Control have joined with Zairian colleagues in a three-year
study of AIDS in central Africa. The study is aimed at learning more about the
natural history and spread of AIDS there and about aspects of AIDS that cannot
be studied in the United States because of the differing epidemiologic patterns.

For example, because physicians in Africa commonly use the same needle to prick
100 or more patients without sterilizing it before each jab, one point under
study is the risk of health workers spreading AIDS from common medical
practices.



AIDS Among Haitians

Shortly after AIDS was first detected, researchers noted a disproportionately
high number of AIDS cases among Haitian women living in the United States
compared to other groups. Further studies showed that Haitians who arrived in
the United States after 1977 appeared to have higher AIDS rates than Haitians
who had been in this country for a longer period. Subsequently AIDS researchers
recognized the disease in Haiti.

Now, as the data collected in a National Institutes of Health-financed study in
Haiti are beginning to be compiled, a team of American and Haitian doctors
headed by Dr. Johnson of New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center is finding
that most Haitians are not infected with the AIDS virus. Of AIDS patients in
Haiti, about one-fourth are in women.

Although bisexuality is the most common risk factor among male AIDS cases in
Haiti and blood transfusions the most common risk factor among women, Dr.
Johnson said, half the AIDS patients in the Caribbean country lacked evidence of
the risk factors found among American cases. Both male and female AIDS patients
reported more sexual activity in terms of the number of partners per year than
did their siblings or friends who served as age and sex matched scientific
controls. Although the data hints at heterosexual transmission, ''by itself it
does not say AIDS is transmitted heterosexually,'' Dr. Johnson emphasized.

Haitian AIDS patients reported receiving more intramusclar injections of
medications from health workers than did those in the control group. The
differences were statistically significant ''but the interpretation is not
simple,'' Dr. Johnson said, because the data do not necessarily mean that the
needles transmitted the AIDS virus. Among possible alternative explanations:
AIDS patients might have had more injections as treatment for venereal disease
or other conditions, or the patients might have been treated for the earliest
symptoms of AIDS without realizing they were due to AIDS.



Noncharacteristic Victims

In the United States, 308 AIDS patients, or 4 percent of the 7,886 adult AIDS
patients, did not report any of the identified risk groups and fall into what
the Centers for Disease Control calls a noncharacteristic group. Epidemiologic
investigation has raised questions about the role of prostitutes in spreading
AIDS. Of 65 of the male noncharacteristic patients, 17, or 26 percent, reported
a history of sexual contact with female prostitutes. Five of the 17 gave a
history of more than 100 heterosexual partners in the previous five years and
one of the nine noncharacteristic women interviewed claimed to be a former
prostitute. A complicating factor in studying the role prostitutes play in
spreading AIDS is that many are at risk for the disease because they are
believed to be intravenous drug users.

Although there have been cases where males may have acquired AIDS from female
prostitutes in the United States, heterosexual spread of AIDS has been primarily
from males to females, particularly among female sexual partners of intravenous
drug users. This experience contrasts to the African data that suggest
transmission of AIDS from females to males may be more common there.

''The importance of female-to- male transmission in the spread of AIDS in the
United States and the role, if any, of female prostitutes in this transmission
have not been established,'' Centers for Disease Control officials have said.
''The number of these women presently infected is likely to be small. It is not
known if such women would be as efficient as heterosexual or homosexual men in
transmitting the AIDS virus.''

Studies done by researchers at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington
and the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda have turned up further evidence
suggesting that prostitutes can spread AIDS. The data has come from exposures
that members of the United States Army have had with prostitutes in foreign
countries outside of Africa and Haiti, according to Dr. Robert R. Redfield of
Walter Reed.

Of about 45 AIDS cases in Army personnel, risk factors could not be identified
in 15, Dr. Redfield said. In about 80 percent of the 15 cases, the patients
reported having had sex with prostitutes in the United States, West Germany,
Korea and Turkey.

In a news release issued by the University of California at San Francisco, Dr.
Paul Volberding, who directs the AIDS clinic at the San Francisco General
Hospital, said that three of the four AIDS patients who are believed to have
acquired the disease through heterosexual contact were males and that they
reported having had sex with prostitutes.

Although ''it is impossible to be 100 percent certain that the four patients
developed AIDS through their sexual contact,'' Dr. Volberding said, ''it is
reasonable to assume that they did because the four had no other known risk
factors.''

New York City Health Commissioner, Dr. David J. Sencer, said that his team had
analyzed the data continuously since the Montefiore report showing heterosexual
transmission from drug addicts to their female sexual partners. Dr. Sencer said
that of the 2,848 reported cases of AIDS, 38 were sex partners of intravenous
drug users and 42 were listed in the noncharacteristic group. The proportion of
such cases had remained steady at about one percent, Dr. Sencer said, and added:
''We are concerned but we haven't seen'' a substantial or rising number of
heterosexually transmitted AIDS cases.

Hearing aid expert warns public not to pay over the odds for hearing aids;
A recent survey of hearing aid users revealed that many people paid TWICE as
much for the same aid as others

After 30 years as Managing Director of some of the UK's largest hearing aid
firms, Mark Moss knows what hearing aids should really cost. He also knows that
if you buy a cheap hearing aid without the proper advice and after-care - you
could find the aid is not so cheap after all. That's why he has now produced a
brochure to help people who are thinking of buying a hearing aid for the very
first time or considering an upgrade to a better model.

The fact is many people who suffer from hearing loss are reluctant to attempt to
buy a hearing aid because they find the whole process confusing and are not sure
where to find truly independent advice and the best prices.

Trustworthy Advice

This is unfortunate because there are many professional independent hearing aid
dispensers who take great care and pride in providing the latest hearing
solutions for your individual needs. However, one national chain is charging
twice the price for a hearing aid than you can get with other dispensers. Many
large companies who employ dispensers are owned by Hearing Aid Manufacturers
chemists and opticians have also turned to selling hearing aids.

Nothing in either ear

The market is changing and customers are getting younger, buying digital aids
for the mildest of hearing problem. Some simply want a tiny corrector that will
fit into the ear and not be noticed at all - so it is practically invisible.
Some hearing aids work without anything in the ear but by using bone conduction
through a pair of glasses. What is definite is that people want something to
alleviate their hearing loss but is so tiny that it cannot be seen.

So before you even think of buying a hearing aid - make sure you're armed with
this revolutionary new FREE Hearing Aid Guide.

Who has the best price? Dear Consumer, "" I have compiled a comprehensive list
of prices of hearing aids in the United Kingdom and offer you my opinion for the
best dispenser and service in your area.

Hearing aids are being offered at huge discount prices but you must be assured
of the right professional after-care.

There are now a wide range of aids and it is vital that you get the one that's
right for your specific needs.

At last.prices are now falling At last for the latest digital aids.

Due to consumer led pressure prices are now falling for the latest digital
hearing aids as never before.

My brochure tells you how you can get a proper aid at a decent price AND ensure
correct after care from a reliable dispenser.

UK aid money: the key datasets you need to know

BYLINE: Claire Provostguardian.co.uk

LENGTH: 994 words

ABSTRACT

Claire Provost: As David Cameron renews Britain's pledge to increase its aid
budget, we highlight the five key datasets to help understand the debates

FULL TEXT

The UK prime minister reaffirmed on Tuesday Britain's pledge to spend 0.7% of
gross-national income on aid by 2013. David Cameron's statement, at the UN
general assembly in New York, comes despite growing calls from members of his
own party to rein in Britain's aid spending.

Over the last two weeks, conservative British newspapers, including the Sunday
Telegraph and the Daily Mail, have attacked the Department for International
Development (DfID) for spending millions of British aid moneyon a group of
highly profitable consultancy firms. The drama has resurrected a long-standing
question, highlighted last year over UK aid to India, about whether donors
should spend money on middle-income countries.

Here are five key datasets to help understand the debates:

How big is the UK aid budget?

Last year, the UK spent $13.7bn (£8.57bn) on official development assistance
(ODA) - what the rest of us call "aid". Note that DfID, which spent £7.6bn on
ODA last year isn't the only government department in charge of UK aid. The
Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the UK Border Agency, for example, also
contribute towards the 0.7% target.

The UK is the world's third largest donor from countries of the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), following Germany ($14.5bn) and
the US ($30.7bn). But as a percentage of gross national income (GNI), British
aid spending was 0.56% in 2011 - far greater than the US equivalent of 0.20%.
Only five OECD countries - Sweden, Norway, Luxembourg, Denmark, and the
Netherlands - have already met the 0.7% commitment.

What does this mean for the UK taxpayer? With a population of about 62.6
million, last year's £8.57bn spend works out at roughly £137 per head.

· Get the data

Which countries get UK aid?

Last year, DfID announced that 16 countries would no longer receive bilateral
aid from Britain by 2016, as a result of the department's spending reviews.

The biggest announced increase in aid was for Somalia, with a 208% rise planned
between 2010 and 2015. This was followed by Nigeria, with an increase of 116%.
By 2015, Pakistan would receive the largest chunk of UK aid - £1.4bn, up 107%
from 2010.

Billions of aid are also spent through groups such as the World Bank, the EU,
and UN agencies. Last year, the UK spent £5bn on bilateral aid programmes and
£3.5bn on multilateral aid. Sometimes funding through international
organisations is classified as bilateral aid - the distinction depends, roughly,
on how much control the donor has over that money.

· Get the data

Health or wealth? What are Britain's foreign aid priorities?

Last year's aid spending reviews gave us headline figures on how UK aid would
concentrate on an increasingly small pool of developing countries. But it didn't
tell us exactly how money would be spent in those countries.

To get a better sense of how British aid spending would break down over the
coming years, the Guardian pulled out all the data from the country-level
operational plans published by DfID, which included tables dividing budgets
across the different sectors - from governance and security to education,
health, water and sanitation.

Health and education remain among the top areas for UK bilateral aid. But within
sectors, interesting trends are apparent. For example, according to the data,
reproductive, maternal and newborn health will consume nearly 64% of DfID's
global health funding by 2015, while the share of bilateral aid for HIV and Aids
will drop from 16% in 2010-11 to less than 6% in 2014-15.

How has UK aid spending changed over time?

The UK has a long-standing foreign aid programme. But how has the geography of
UK aid spending changed over time? Last year, the Guardian pulled out all the
data on UK aid spending since 1960 to follow the money trail.

In 1960, among the top recipients of UK aid were Cyprus and Malta. One year
later, this had already changed dramatically: in 1961, Kenya and India were top
recipients. India received the largest chunk of UK aid for most of the 1960s and
1970s. The turn of the new millennium saw an explosion in the number of UK aid
recipients.

· Get the data

Thebusiness of UK aid

The UK fully "untied" its aid budget in 2001, opening up its aid-funded
contracts to international competition. "Buy local" campaigners hoped this move
would offer developing country firms a larger share of the aid-funded business,
and bring taxes, jobs and the development of local manufacturing and expertise.

But data compiled by the Guardian shows the vast majority of DfID's contracts
are still going to companies based in the UK. Of nearly 120 major contracts and
procurement agreements (together worth almost £750m) published on the
government's contracts portal since January 2011, only nine include non-UK firms
among the grantees. An Indian company, Kran Consulting, is the only firm from a
developing country on the list to win a full contract.

Earlier this month, the shadow development secretary Ivan Lewis pressed the
department for details on how much UK aid has been spent in the private sector.
This would go above and beyond UK aid spending through consultants. In a written
response, the international development secretary, Justine Greening, said the
department didn't hold this information centrally and it "could be obtained only
at disproportionate cost".

World AIDS Day to mark those died deadly disease

SECTION: Vol. 16 No. 331

LENGTH: 446  words


The United Nations' (UN) World AIDS Day will be observed on December 1st  all
over the world including Pakistan to honour those who have died of AIDS and
those who live with HIV or AIDS and to increase awareness of these conditions.

AIDS is a condition resulting from damages done to the human immune system by
HIV. It affects tens of millions of people around the world.  The theme of World
AIDS Day 2011 is "Getting to Zero": zero new infections, zero discrimination and
zero AIDS-related deaths".

"Heading into the fourth decade of AIDS, we are finally in a position to end the
epidemic. The progress we have made so far is roof that we can realize our
vision [of getting to zero," said UN Secretary General Ban-Ki Moon in a press
release on World AIDS Day.

Earlier this year, the UN General Assembly High-Level Meeting on AIDS created
goals to reach by 2015: a 50% reduction in the sexual transmission of HIV, no
new infections in children, antiretroviral therapy (ART) for 15 million people
living with HIV, ending stigma and discrimination and closing the AIDS funding
gap.

World AIDS Day is the focal point of the World AIDS Campaign, which is active
all year round. During the days and weeks leading up to World AIDS Day, there
was a lot of coverage of the condition in the media and fundraising for AIDS and
HIV-related charities.

In addition, health education campaigns aiming to reduce the transmission of HIV
and discrimination of people living with HIV and AIDS are often launched on or
around December 1. On World AIDS Day, many community, national and international
leaders issue proclamations on supporting and treating people living with HIV
and AIDS and stimulating research into the treatment of these conditions.

Local communities hold events to remember and honour members who have died of
AIDS-related conditions or exhibitions around the subject. AIDS stands for
"acquired immune deficiency syndrome" or "acquired immunodeficiency syndrome"
and denotes a condition, which results from the damage done by HIV (human
immunodeficiency virus) to the immune system. The condition was first identified
in 1981 and the name "AIDS" was first introduced on July 27, 1982.

There has been a lot of stigma around the spread of HIV and people living with
HIV and AIDS. It has been estimated that around 33 million people around the
world have been infected with HIV and that around two million people die from
AIDS related conditions each year.

On October 27, 1988, the UN General Assembly officially recognized that the
World Health Organization declared December 1, 1988, to be World AIDS Day. World
AIDS Day has also been observed on this date each year since then.

LoGB bats for legal aid reform

BYLINE: Kevin Shereves, Cayman Net News, Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands

SECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS

LENGTH: 821 words


Oct. 23--In an attempt to reduce the escalating cost of legal aid, Premier
Designate and Leader of Government Business, Hon. McKeeva Bush, is proposing a
reform of the legal aid system in the Cayman Islands.

Speaking in the budget debate on Wednesday 21 October, Mr Bush said that
government has decided to accept a plan put forward by local attorneys Steve
McField and Theresa Pitcairn for the establishment of a Legal Services Office
with oversight by a Legal Services Committee, in an effort to reduce the
escalating cost of legal aid. This office would reduce the burden on government,
while ensuring legal aid was distributed fairly.

Mr Bush indicated that, since 1999, according to statistics, the Cayman Islands
government's expenditure on legal aid amounted to little over $13 million.

He said that, during the budget years 2008/2009, legal aid billings by various
attorneys amounted to approximately $187,000 -- which was not approved.

"Had those sums been approved, the legal aid cost to the government of the
Cayman Islands would have amounted to the sum of $2,037,714.22," he said.

Mr Bush said that the McField-Pitcairn plan to reduce this "spiraling and run
away legal aid cost to the Cayman Islands Government" is timely, prudent, and
sensible. He also said that the plan is well thought out "to put a cap on
Government's legal aid spending."

"The government, in order to reduce the escalating rise of the cost of legal aid
in the country, accepted the McField-Pitcairn plan," said Mr Bush, noting
however that such changes are subject to a revision of the existing legal aid
legislation.

He said the plan is designed to assist the Cayman Islands government in reducing
the budget during a time of local and international financial crisis.

"Moreover, the plan is designed to meet the needs of a broader area of the poor
and needy and removes the perception that there is no transparency and
accountability in the way legal aid is dispensed and delivered."

"The Legal Aid Office will render a high quality legal aid service to the many
rather than to the few," he said.

Using Canada as an example, Mr Bush noted that at least one province controlled
rising legal aid costs by means of a law that gives an independent body
responsibility for the administration of legal aid.

"In Quebec, legal aid is administered by an independent legal aid commission
responsible for administering legal aid services in Quebec. This service has
kept legal aid funding in Quebec stable," he said.

Mr Bush said that the primary reason for other governments deciding to make
legal aid services "independent and responsible" was due to the rising cost of
legal aid in those jurisdictions.

He noted that the Legal Services Office would be staffed with salaried,
qualified attorneys and support staff, as well as with Caymanian law students
and graduates. "Those law students and graduates will receive on the job
experience and training to become the future pool of Caymanian legal aid
attorneys," he said.

Outlining one of the benefits, Mr Bush said, "By involving the students of the
Cayman Islands Law School, they will have access to relevant training and
experience and should be able to complete their articles at the clinic."

Among other benefits, Mr Bush said that the proposed legal aid reform would be
"available for all areas of law subject to certain maximum expenditures and
contributions." He said that lawyers will not be paid by appearance in court but
would be salaried and that Family Law matters could be settled through mediation
instead of advancing straight to into court. He added, "The delivery of legal
aid will be more efficient and assist with a controlled budget."

Noting that legal aid recipients will be treated more like clients rather than
wards of the state, Mr Bush said that legal aid recipients will not be required
to pay the mandatory CI$750 filing fee, affording more people the opportunity to
benefit from the system while increasing democracy.

Mr Bush also stated that the plan will provide open-ended legal aid funding,
putting a cap on the amount of legal funds, while making the delivery of legal
aid services independent of the courts and dependent on a structured Legal
Services Office.

Praising the efforts of Steve McField and Theresa Pitcarin for putting forward
the plan, Mr Bush said that they are breaking new ground for low-income
Caymanians.

"They understand that we must work together towards positive change. They
understand change and we welcome it," he said.

AIDS Groups Expand Services to Other Sufferers;
Diversifying Brings Funds and Complaints

BYLINE: Jacqueline L. Salmon, Washington Post Staff Writer

SECTION: Metro; B01

LENGTH: 1293 words


Maritza Sanson, a pixyish woman with a cap of soft brown curls, broke into a
wide smile on a recent afternoon when a Food & Friends volunteer showed up at
her D.C. home with the daily delivery of food.

On today's menu: bagels and cream cheese for Sanson, 42, and her husband, Luis
Fernando Hurtado, 47, as well as fruit salad, fish sandwiches, green beans and
potatoes.

"This is fantastic," Sanson said as she unpacked the containers and stowed them
in her small refrigerator.

Just a few years ago, Sanson, who is recovering from breast cancer, would not
have been able to receive free food delivery from Food & Friends. The District
organization had provided daily meals since 1988 only to those incapacitated by
HIV/AIDS in the Washington area.

But in 2000, Food & Friends began providing six-day-a-week food delivery and
groceries to those with other life-threatening diseases, such as Parkinson's,
cancer and Alzheimer's.

Across the country, more and more AIDS organizations that have provided food,
housing, legal aid, medical treatment and other help to those infected with HIV/
AIDS are diversifying.

But the expansion has drawn concerns from those who note that 40,000 new HIV
infections occur annually in the United States and that 18,000 people a year die
of AIDS. They say that those afflicted by HIV/AIDS will be shunted aside in the
rush to diversify.

"The epidemic is not over," said Michael Petrelis, a San Francisco AIDS
activist. By diversifying, "it seems like they're spreading themselves way too
thin, especially since [AIDS] funding levels are down."

Kandy Ferree, president of the National AIDS Fund, which helps finance about 400
community AIDS groups, said she is concerned that some groups may expand into
fields where they aren't as qualified just to get more funding.

"It is absolutely critical that organizations . . . not chase dollars for the
sake of chasing dollars," Ferree said. "It's very dangerous."

But the AIDS groups that are diversifying say reduced AIDS funding and fading
interest in AIDS causes among donors are forcing them to seek other income
sources. In addition, AIDS groups say, they have a moral imperative to share
expertise developed during two decades of caring for seriously ill AIDS
patients.

"If we've created a service that's needed by people who are sick, then we should
do what we can to expand to meet their needs," said Stephen Woods, executive
director of Project Open Hand in Atlanta. "Just because we responded to a crisis
at one point in time [doesn't make it] necessary to focus only on one
population."

For Food & Friends, the result has been a dramatic change in one of the largest
AIDS organizations in the country. These days, 40 percent of people who receive
food from the group suffer from other illnesses.

Food & Friends' leader says the organization had to expand its clientele to
remain  in operation in an era when AIDS funding is shrinking, the AIDS death
rate has fallen and those infected with HIV are living longer.

"If one depended solely upon funds that are restricted to persons with AIDS, I
think there is a serious question of whether we could survive," said Food &
Friends Executive Director Craig Sniderman.

In Texas, AIDS Foundation Houston now offers housing, substance-abuse treatment
and other help to people suffering from other infectious diseases and diabetes.
The Latino Commission on AIDS in New York is helping Latino immigrants not
afflicted with AIDS apply for asylum. Project Open Hand, which formerly
delivered food just to AIDS patients, now also manages eight senior centers and
delivers food to the elderly.

"It's definitely very much a trend in the field," said Frank Abdale, executive
director of the Association of Nutrition Service Agencies, a national
organization of 120 AIDS groups. Abdale said that all of his association's large
members have expanded beyond AIDS.

AIDS groups have also turned their attention abroad, offering clinics, drug
treatment and other services to combat the international AIDS epidemic. For some
groups, diversifying has had a dramatic impact.

Miracle House, a 14-year-old charity in New York that started out offering
temporary housing to out-of-town caretakers of hospitalized AIDS patients, has
had its proportion of AIDS patients fall to just 10 percent of its clientele
since it opened to those with other ailments and their caretakers.

Miracle House Executive Director Gilles Mesrobian said the organization
broadened its mission after noticing that demand was falling because fewer AIDS
patients were being hospitalized for long periods.

"If we had not made this transition, we probably would not have survived," he
said. "A lot of smaller [AIDS] organizations have failed because they were
unable to keep abreast of change or adapt to the landscape."

AIDS groups say that expansion has helped them shore up sagging fundraising
efforts.

"There is an awful lot of donor fatigue on AIDS," said Mike Smith, executive
director of the AIDS Emergency Fund in San Francisco, which expanded to include
breast cancer patients a few years ago. Since then, it has received tens of
thousands of dollars from such groups as the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer
Foundation.

Some groups are looking abroad, where the international AIDS crisis is drawing
more attention -- and dollars -- than the domestic AIDS situation.

Next year, for example, the Children Affected by AIDS Foundation in Los Angeles
expects that its funds going to international AIDS initiatives will jump from 10
percent to 25 percent of its budget, said Executive Director Catherine Brown.

The group operates programs in Latin America and the Caribbean to work with
children affected by AIDS. It plans to expand to up to a dozen countries.

Noting that an estimated 13 million children worldwide have been orphaned by
AIDS, Brown said her group couldn't look away.

"You can't be in pediatric HIV/AIDS and have that as your mission and ignore
what's going on internationally," Brown said.

At Food & Friends, expanding its mission also caused some strife -- internally
and externally.

The local ACT UP chapter has objected to the change. Spokesman Wayne Turner said
Food & Friends' move is "an embodiment of what is happening with [AIDS]
charities around the country. These groups that were formed to meet the specific
needs of people with AIDS have become monsters."

Food & Friends' leadership also argued over the changes.

"We had some members who felt that we might be abandoning the gay community,"
said Suzanne Goldstein, president of Food & Friends' board of directors.

Since the expansion took effect, Food & Friends has prospered. Its budget has
climbed about 35 percent since 2000 -- from $4.7 million to an expected $6.3
million in 2005.

In October, it opened an $8.7 million headquarters in Northeast Washington --
twice the size of its leased facilities in Southeast Washington.

The new facility -- with a large commercial kitchen, 10 walk-in freezers and
coolers, and a covered loading area -- will allow the group to triple the number
of people to whom it delivers food to 3,000 people a day.

It now feeds 1,000 in 14 counties in the Washington area.

The diversification to other illnesses also has enabled the charity to attract
funding from organizations that wouldn't have given it a second look before,
leaders say.

The Avon Foundation has donated $1.5 million -- half for Food & Friends'
headquarters construction and half to help fund its services to breast cancer
patients.

Avon Foundation President Kathleen Walas said her organization was impressed
that the group had expanded into other illnesses after doing such a good job
focusing on HIV/AIDS victims.

Food & Friends is "an organization for others of their type to keep an eye on,"
Walas said.

More help is needed for AIDS/HIV patients and families

BYLINE: David T. Bunker

SECTION: COMMENTARY; AS I SEE IT; Pg. A11

LENGTH: 778 words

DATELINE: WORCESTER


'Jesse" was 17 when her mom and dad died, taken from their five children by
AIDS. The deaths left the teenager to try to care for herself and her younger
siblings in their Worcester-area apartment.

With no money for rent, heat or food and only each other for comfort in their
grief, Jesse did not know what to do or where to turn for help.

After a neighbor's call, AIDS Project Worcester stepped in to give Jesse the
help she needed. These children aren't infected with HIV/AIDS. They are among
nearly 5,900 Worcester County residents receiving AIDS Project Worcester
services because their lives are profoundly affected by this deadly disease.

AIDS Project Worcester immediately sent caseworkers to Jesse's home. The workers
sized up their situation and connected the children to support services:
vouchers for food, heat and necessities, and hours of counseling. Eventually,
new homes were found for the children.

For families such as Jesse's, the devastation of AIDS is on the rise. HIV/AIDS
infections will increase by as much as 8 percent this year.

In Central Massachusetts, the contagion strikes a disproportionate number of
women, with more than 70 percent infected through sexual contact with infected
men; 48 percent of our infected clients are women.

It gets worse.

The HIV/AIDS Statewide Surveillance Report says infection rates are rising at an
alarming pace. Almost half of new cases reported in 2003 are among people 29 or
younger, mainly 13- to 24-year-olds. Infection rates among Latinos and African
Americans are increasing as well.

Currently, more than 46 percent of AIDS Project Worcester's infected clients are
white; 33 percent are Hispanic; and nearly 20 percent are black.

Caught early, the deadly effects of the disease can be forestalled, sometimes
for years. "Cheryl" was the mother of two young children when she contracted HIV
from her husband. "I wondered who was going to take care of my kids," Cheryl
said later. "I thought it was an immediate death sentence for me."

With no family support, Cheryl's life became a struggle to survive. She suffered
HIV related illnesses and side effects from the medicines.

When she moved to Worcester, Cheryl joined nearly 1,400 other infected people
here who receive help from AIDS Project Worcester.

She has survived with HIV for 15 years, living a productive life and now
volunteering with AIDS Project Worcester. Just last month, Cheryl welcomed her
first grandchild into the world.

Sadly, 30 percent of all newly diagnosed cases have already progressed to AIDS -
too late for the treatments that help Cheryl. These new HIV/AIDS victims - and
their families - need our help.

"Maria," 10, is one of those survivors. AIDS took her mom last year; her dad
died from AIDS when she was just a toddler.

An AIDS Project Worcester worker helped Maria's mom arrange for her disabled
child's future before she died, the Project later helped Maria's adoptive family
deal with problems involving services and child care needs.

State budget cuts have since brought an end to the AIDS Project Worcester
program that helped Maria's mom. Since 2001 cuts have slashed funds for HIV/AIDS
Prevention and Treatment Services by 37 percent.

Other critical health and social service agencies that help prevent the spread
of HIV/AIDS have endured cuts of up to 82 percent.

That means the escalating costs of helping Central Massachusetts HIV/AIDS
victims and their families - 7,300 and rising - falls increasingly on privately
supported groups such as AIDS Project Worcester.

Please help AIDS Project Worcester to serve those already infected and affected
by HIV/AIDS and to protect our children, our neighbors and our communities from
this still deadly scourge.

David T. Bunker is president of the board of AIDS Project Worcester Inc.

Nov. 29 through Dec. 2 is World AIDS Week, focusing on local and global efforts
to combat HIV and AIDS.

AIDS Project Worcester is a comprehensive AIDS service organization.

Its primary office is at 85 Green St., Worcester. It has satellite offices in
Southbridge and Leominster.

AIDS Project Worcester services are provided without charge. The organization,
which increasingly relies on donations because of state funding cuts, is
appealing during World AIDS Week for donations and volunteer help. Volunteers
are needed now to distribute holiday food baskets. New toys are needed for AIDS
Project Worcester's 540 children.

HOW TO GET INVOLVED: To help, call volunteer coordinator Tricia at (508)
755-3773 ext. 16. Attend Art for AIDS Sake on Dec. 10 at Holy Cross College's
Hogan Center. For more information, call Merredith at (508) 755-3773 ext. 41.

'Why Should AIDS Be a Privileged Disease?'

BYLINE: Charles Krauthammer

SECTION: EDITORIAL; PAGE A15; '

LENGTH: 1005 words


AIDS is public health enemy No. 1, says President Reagan. It is on every front
page, on every candidate's lips. Everyone agrees: we need to do more. Sen.
Robert Dole has the presidential candidate's standard AIDS formulation, calling
for spending "whatever resources [are] necessary to get the job done."

"Whatever resources?" When politicians are unanimous on any issue, it is time to
pause. Sen. Al Gore has called for a "Manhattan Project" on AIDS. Why should the
fight against AIDS be the exclusive beneficiary of a massive government effort?

Because AIDS is fatal? Since 1981 AIDS has killed about 20,000 Americans. Heart
disease kills 65,000 every month. Because AIDS strikes young people in the prime
of their lives? Schizophrenia, which afflicts 1,650,000 Americans, is also a
disease of young people. It destroys their minds. (Many of the wretched homeless
are finishing long careers as schizophrenics.) Because AIDS is going to strike a
lot of people in the future? The surgeon general estimates that by the end of
1991 a total of 270,000 AIDS cases will have occurred. This year alone there
will be 965,000 new cancer cases.

It is not good politics to come out against an AIDS cure, but it is worth asking
the question: Why should AIDS be a privileged disease -- federally protected, as
it were -- while other diseases, many of which cause suffering in many more
Americans, are not?

The only possible answer is that AIDS is such an explosive threat to society
that it must be stopped now. The key to this claim is that AIDS is breaking
through to the general population. But the latest numbers from the Centers for
Disease Control indicate otherwise. AIDS remains largely confined to two groups:
male homosexuals and'IV'drug abusers. They continue to account for 9 out of 10
AIDS cases. Heterosexual transmission accounts for no more than 4 percent of
cases.

A Berkeley study presented in Washington at the Third International Conference
on AIDS demonstrates how difficult heterosexual transmission really is. It
showed that women whose partners had AIDS needed a very large number of sexual
contacts before contracting the disease. For example, of women who had sex more
than 600 times with an AIDS patient, only one in three contracted the disease.
(If 1 percent of random males is an AIDS carrier, a woman would thus need 60,000
individual sexual contacts with American males to incur a one-third chance of
contracting AIDS.)

It is true that in Africa AIDS is a heterosexual disease, but that simply is not
so in America. There is nothing odd or startling about this. Many diseases have
different epidemiologies in different parts of the world. In the United States,
AIDS remains a disease principally of two major risk groups.

Of the two, drug abusers are not organized. Gays are. Gay rights groups have
turned AIDS into a political issue. They have two principal demands on the
government: immediate cure and no testing. And they have not been reticent about
their wishes. During the Washington conference, there were many political
demonstrations. A sit-down outside the White House featured chants of "Reagan,
Reagan, too little, too late." Pamphlets distributed at the conference urged the
booing of administration officials who proposed testing. And booed they were,
despite the fact that the proposals they offered were tentative and moderate.

Vice President George Bush suggested testing aliens who seek entry to the United
States. Boo. He proposed testing prisoners. (Also reasonable: you cannot stop
all homosexual rape in prisons, but, by segregating those who are AIDS-positive,
you can prevent a rape from becoming a death sentence.) Boo again. He proposed
testing couples about to marry. (Also reasonable: it might prevent a finite
number of children being born with AIDS.) More boos.

Gays have every right, of course, to lobby for AIDS. But the general public has
an equal right to question their sense of entitlement. Other groups have other
diseases, some just as terrible, some more so. Medical claims on society, like
nonmedical claims, must be tested against each other. Yet the AIDS constituency
has been adamant in demanding special protection.

And getting it. Last August, the District of Columbia made it illegal for
insurance companies to require routine AIDS tests for people applying for life
and health insurance. Normally, insurance companies want to know whether you are
subject to a life-threatening illness. Getting insurance is difficult if you
are. The callousness of the actuarial table is an argument perhaps for national
health insurance. It is not an argument for giving a special exemption to those
carrying the AIDS virus.

Where does this sense of entitlement come from? After all, unlike, say, a brain
tumor, AIDS is preventable. We know exactly how to contract it and exactly how
to prevent it. Preventative measures are not particularly complicated. Moreover,
they are all within the power of the individual to control.

With rare exceptions, contracting AIDS is like contracting lung cancer: it
requires the collaboration of the victim. That is not true of many other
catastrophic illnesses. This does not mean that AIDS victims deserve neither our
compassion nor our support. It does mean that those who claim that AIDS victims
deserve special compassion and special support have some explaining to do. They
have not done it.

On Capitol Hill, when money is preferentially funneled to a particular disease
in the news, cynics call it the "disease of the month club" syndrome. AIDS is
turning into the disease of the decade. It is hard to speak dispassionately
about AIDS without getting booed.

AIDS deserves funding and its victims our care. But AIDS is not the pandemic its
publicists would like us to believe, nor does it merit its privileged position
at the head of every line of human misfortunes that make claims on our
resources, attention and compassion. It is a disease. You would not know it from
reading the papers, but there are others.

Agencies say famine aid is getting through

LENGTH: 516 words


Famine relief aid is reaching Africa's starving millions, according to
Australian aid agencies.

Spokesmen for Freedom From Hunger, Community Aid Abroad and World Vision
yesterday acknowledged the Marxist Ethiopian Government was preventing
desperately-need food reaching rebel-held areas where 60 p.c. of Ethiopia's
starving lived.

But they said aid channelled through private agencies was getting through.

They were commenting on a report in yesterday's Advertiser

that quoted aid experts, interviewed by the US magazine Spin,

as saying the Live Aid relief program was turning Ethiopia into a massive
Government-sponsored killing field.

They said food supplies were being used as bait to draw millions of famine
victims into massive resettlement camps in a campaign which "is killing
thousands and brutally displacing millions more".

The State director of Freedom From Hunger, Mr John Sandover, said the report "is
just echoing what Freedom From Hunger has been saying for the last year".

"We knew that the aid going through the Mengistu Government was being used in
that way," he said.

However, Mr Sandover said this represented only a small portion of the $A144m
raised by Irish-born pop singer Bob Geldof's Live Aid campaign.

"The article, while it's factually correct, is almost labelling all aid as not
getting there, which is really untrue," he said.

Mr Sandowver said much of the aid was channelled through organisations such as
Freedom From Hunger, which did not deal through governments but took aid
directly to those in need.

"If we got to an area where we could see our aid was being diverted by the
Government, we'd stop doing it," he said.

He said government agencies were obliged to give aid through the governments of
the recipient countries, which meant corrupt foreign governments could channel
the aid into other areas, such as war efforts.

"We've been advising people if they want aid to get there, then do it through
agencies like Freedom From Hunger, which makes sure it gets there," Mr Sandover
said.

A spokesman for Community Aid Abroad, Mr Brian Loffler, said all aid from CAA
was sent to voluntary aid groups in Ethiopia rather than to the Ethiopian
Government.

He said there had been reports of the Government misusing aid in the past but
CAA aid was reaching the needy.

"One of our workers has just returned from Ethiopia and he has seen that aid is
going to the right places," he said.

"CAA now concentrates on long-term aid programs rather than short-term food aid,
and this has proved to be more successful."

'Straight to the people'

World Vision's media officer, Mr Allan Ash, said people frequently claimed that
aid was being misused by the Ethiopian Government.

"It's very easy to make these claims and difficult for us to disprove them," he
said.

"We have gone to check out accusations before and in every case they have been
false.

"Government-to-government aid has been known to go astray, but everything from
World Vision goes straight to the people and does not leave our hands until it
gets there."

Now I see AIDS positively and spiritually

BYLINE: MARIO GENEREUX

SECTION: NEWS; LETTER OF THE DAY; Pg. A9


On Jan. 3 we published a letter from AIDS patient Mario Genereux, "Reach out and
touch someone who is living with the loneliness of AIDS." It was judged letter
of the month.

Instead of reprinting that letter, which is our usual practice, we are
publishing a new letter from Mario telling about his life with AIDS. He will
still receive a royal-blue ballpoint pen topped with a golden quill.

AIDS kills, AIDS harms, AIDS shatters, AIDS destroys, AIDS shames, AIDS sickens,
AIDS transforms, AIDS monopolizes, AIDS diminishes, AIDS disturbs, AIDS breeds,
AIDS generates prejudice, AIDS is high-priced.

My name is Mario Gnreux, I was born 32 years ago in Wakefield. In March 1992,
following a bout of pneumonia, I was diagnosed with AIDS while serving as a
corporal in the Canadian Forces and working in the financial field. Since then I
have spent many months in the hospital.

I count myself lucky to have the support and understanding of most of my family
and friends. I was released from the Canadian Forces on Jan. 6, with a
recognition of good service.

Today, I concentrate on talking about AIDS in the community.

I see AIDS positively and spiritually. I obtained this by reading many books and
medical articles on the subject. I believe that by facing the possibility of
dying I have gained wisdom.

Instead of letting myself die like so many other people living with AIDS I have
decided to live each day fully realizing the importance of life. I understand
the fear related to AIDS but please do not be afraid of me.

A major attitude problem for many of us is the "can't-happen-to-me" syndrome.
This denial of the risk is very commonly expressed by men and women as well as
our youth who still think this epidemic only touches gay men.

Fight fear with facts. As the virus causing AIDS, the Human Immuno-deficiency
Virus (HIV) has spread to more people and different groups, our concern as a
society has grown. AIDS can no longer be seen as a problem exclusive to small
minority groups.

So, too, has our understanding of the infection grown. Armed with this new
knowledge, we can identify the real risk, and be reassured rather than fearful,
as AIDS is not caught in most everyday situations but only as a result of
certain risk behaviors.

Knowledge, then, helps us to control our fear and channel serious concerns into
behaviours that are AIDS avoiding. As a result of my experience with my own
doctor, I note that the medical field also needs to re-evaluate its
discriminatory behavior towards AIDS patients.

AIDS for me is the quiet degeneration of my faculties, both physical and mental.
It is also the continuous attention to my health, getting sufficient rest and
keeping my surroundings sterile as germs and viruses can affect me seriously.

AIDS is monthly blood checks, taking powerful and expensive medication
(approximately $ 3,000 every two months).

AIDS is also the loss of my independence, the loss of work and financial
security, the loss of certain friendships, the loss of freedom to travel. Later,
it will mean the loss of my mobility, the loss of my privacy; it will mean
dependency on others and certain social services. Some of the diseases that can
affect me are "Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia" (PCP), a parasitic infection of
the lungs and often the first symptoms to cause a doctor to suspect AIDS and
"Kaposi sarcoma" (KS), a rare type of cancer of the blood vessels and lymphatic
system which may first appear as a blue-violet or brownish spot on the skin.

Other opportunistic infections include tuberculosis, cytomegalovirus, herpes
virus, and parasites such as toxoplasmosis or cryptosporidia.

The only positive thing I can say at this moment is that I have gained eight
hours of sunlight a day. I have had to make drastic changes concerning my
sexuality.

Like Sue Rodriguez, I am faced with my eventual incapacity and I sincerely want
to have the liberty of choosing my time to die. Being aware of the continual
deterioration of my condition, it will be eventually my wish not to be connected
to any life supporting machine or given any medication that may prolong my life.

It has been said that death is the ultimate accomplishment of life. In
conclusion, if you know someone living with HIV/AIDS just call and say "I'm
thinking of you today."

AIDS WAR SHUNNED BY MANY DOCTORS

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

SECTION: Section A; Page 1, Column 1; Metropolitan Desk

LENGTH: 1798 words


Nine years into the AIDS epidemic, most of the nation's physicians are still
failing to take part in the fight to treat and control the deadly disease, many
health experts say.

Many physicians decline to accept new AIDS patients. Others fail to take sexual
and drug histories from patients, and neglect to counsel them on how to avoid
infection. And experts say few doctors test their patients for the antibodies to
the AIDS virus, which signal infection.

Dr. June E. Osborn, chairwoman of the National Commission on AIDS, a Federal
panel, said, ''An awful lot of people are hanging back, pretending to themselves
there may be a place left in the world where you can practice medicine without
dealing with AIDS.''

Overworked Cadre of Doctors

Because of the attitude Dr. Osborn described, people in the early stages of the
disease are going undiagnosed, missing out on life-prolonging drugs at the point
when those drugs could do them the most good. Some are unwittingly spreading the
human immunodeficiency virus to new victims. And the growing number of people
infected with HIV must often compete to get treatment from the small, overworked
cadre of doctors who will accept them. Some physicians find this deplorable. ''I
know physicians who brag that they don't have a single HIV-positive patient in
their practice,'' Dr. Patricia Kloser told the National AIDS Commission when it
visited Newark recently. She directs AIDS services for University Hospital at
the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey.

With an estimated 200,000 people infected with the virus, New York City has more
AIDS cases than any other city in the world. Still, the city's Health Department
records show that 78 percent of local physicians and dentists have never done a
single AIDS test.

Shortage Grows Outside Cities

Although the city has about 25,000 physicians, the Gay Men's Health Crisis, the
largest volunteer AIDS agency, has a referral list of just 45 qualified private
AIDS specialists in Manhattan who are willing to take patients. There are only
one or two for each of the city's other four boroughs, which have half the
city's cases. Some Connecticut and New Jersey AIDS patients also rely on
Manhattan doctors.

The problem exists across the nation. Outside the major cities, the shortage of
doctors is far worse. Patients may have to drive hundreds of miles for
treatment.

Throughout the nation, doctors appear reluctant to learn more about the disease.
When an AIDS organization in Albuquerque, N.M., sent invitations to 1,300
medical practitioners for a recent seminar on important new treatments, only one
person showed up. In rural Georgia, 65 physicians were surveyed on whether they
would take an AIDS patient. Two said they would.

Obstacles to Treatment

Many doctors who do not treat AIDS patients have a number of shortcomings,
including a lack of training, fear of infection, disdain for homosexuals and
drug abusers, fear of scaring off non-AIDS patients, discomfort in discussing
sex and drugs, and failure to recognize AIDS symptoms. They may also be
reluctant to face the strain of seeing young patients die and to deal with the
intricacies of AIDS testing and confidentiality.

All those factors are obstacles to effective treatment, which are compounded for
people who lack health insurance or are poor and rely on Medicaid
reimbursements. ''Private doctors won't take people who don't have insurance and
can't pay upfront,'' Mark Harrington of the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power
said.

Such patients must usually rely on municipal hospitals for treatment. Dr. Dennis
P. Andrulis, president of the Public Health and Hospital Institute, said just 5
percent of the nation's hospitals care for half of its AIDS cases.

California's Response

Pressure is building on doctors to take a role in the fight against AIDS. Among
those sounding the call are the new United States Surgeon General, Dr. Antonia
Novello, and a growing number of state and local health officials, medical
schools and medical organizations, which have been criticized as slow to
respond.

California's Medical Association is at the forefront. Its leaders were alarmed
by a study showing that 79 percent of state residents had visited a doctor but
that AIDS was mentioned in only 6 percent of the visits. The group has
undertaken a campaign urging patients to raise the subject of AIDS if their
doctors fail to do so.

''We said we're not doing it, so you do it,'' said Dr. Mark I. Madsen, the
organization's education director. ''Physicians were waiting for patients to
bring it up, and they were waiting for their doctors to say something -
everybody was waiting for the other guy.''

New York's State Health Commissioner, Dr. David Axelrod, is writing to all
physicians in his state urging them to discuss AIDS with patients as routinely
as they talk about diet, exercise, blood pressure, alcohol and smoking.

A Warning in Dental Work

Dental work is also often overlooked as a vital early-warning system for HIV
infection. Frequently the first signs are oral, including lesions and thrush, a
fungal infection of the mouth. Chuck Partridge, an AIDS service advocate in
Manhattan, said many adults under 45 years - the most likely age group to be
infected with the virus - do not have physicians but do see dentists regularly.
A national poll of 5,800 dentists last year found that only 31 percent said they
were willing to treat AIDS patients.

With upwards of one million Americans estimated to be infected with the AIDS
virus, health experts say it is malpractice to engage in medicine or dentistry
without full knowledge of the disease. The California Medical Association is
warning doctors that they could be sued by patients or their families if they
neglect to learn about AIDS and its treatment and to use that knowledge to treat
patients.

The Physicians Association for AIDS Care, which is based in Chicago, has 600
members nationally who have treated 58,000 patients for AIDS illnesses. It has a
referral list of 2,000 doctors - a sliver of the country's 600,000 physicians
and 180,000 dentists.

Often AIDS specialists are overwhelmed with cases and emotional stress.
Frequently, one physician carries hundreds of patients. Some doctors must turn
away new clients, and some have burned out.

Added to this is the fact that the pool of AIDS doctors also shrinks
periodically because some are gay and are dying of the disease.

The urgency of involving more doctors in treating AIDS was heightened by the
discovery of drugs that slow the progression of AIDS, especially in earlier
stages. AIDS experts estimate that at least half of those infected with the
virus should be receiving treatment, and that the rest should be monitored every
few months.

Those services do not require AIDS specialists and should be delivered by
regular primary-care physicians, health experts say.

Discrimination May Be Subtle

Despite this vast need for health care in the war on AIDS, most medical
professionals remain an army in reserve. Some doctors and dentists have been
accused in formal bias complaints of refusing AIDS cases outright.

But usually the discrimination is more subtle than the outright refusal to treat
patients, AIDS organizations say. Physicians may decline to become educated
about AIDS, a disease that was discovered after most of them went to medical
school. If a case arises, they turn it over to another doctor.

''They claim they have no expertise, but they make no effort to learn,'' said
Dennis DeLeon, New York City's Human Rights Commissioner.

Doctors who are not educated about AIDS may fail to consider the possibility of
that diagnosis, especially with patients who do not fit stereotypes. Some
doctors have imperiled patients' lives by failing to properly diagnose AIDS and
to prescribe correct treatment.

''A lot of doctors are saying they're not seeing HIV disease, but that's because
they're not looking for it,'' said Dr. Iris Davis of New York Hospital.

A chilling example was cited by Dr. Tadd S. Lazarus of St. Clare's Hospital in
Manhattan. Dr. Lazarus told of a well-educated, successful businesswoman from
Westchester County who became progressively disabled in recent months. Her
doctors there could not pinpoint the cause. One suggested melancholia. Another
joked about AIDS, but no one raised the disease as a serious possibility.
Finally she went on her own for an HIV test, which was positive. Then she went
to St. Clare's, where doctors immediately diagnosed the classic symptoms of
AIDS. She is now on AZT and regaining normal functions.

Intimidating, Complex Therapies

Both the American Medical Association and the American Dental Association have
urged their members to confront AIDS, and both defend their efforts. The critics
acknowledge progress but say it has not kept up with the epidemic.

Dr. M. Roy Schwarz, chairman of the American Medical Association's AIDS program,
said he talks to many doctors who see AIDS patients. ''The internist I go to has
30 or 40 patients with AIDS, and he says virtually every physician he knows has
some,'' he said.

Dr. Woodrow A. Myers Jr., New York City's new Health Commissioner, said, ''All
physicians in this city are going to have no choice but to take care of people
with HIV and AIDS.''

Dr. Myers's predecessor, Dr. Stephen C. Joseph, said the state should require
physicians to be trained in AIDS diagnosis and treatment to remain licensed. But
some medical experts say forced education will not work as well as voluntary
programs.

Doctors across the country are tackling the problem in their own way.

Dr. Rodney Hayward of Ann Arbor, Mich., is studying the issue of AIDS education
in medical schools for the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. He said the schools
''have been slow to prepare new physicians to care for these patients - we're
really approaching a crisis.''

Frustrated by a lack of money and staff to serve 700 patients, Dr. Daniel J.
Barbaro quit as head of the public AIDS clinic at Parkland Memorial Hospital in
Dallas. Now, as a private physician in Fort Worth, he gets AIDS cases from
doctors who will not take them for whatever reasons.

''Only a select few will take them,'' Dr. Barbaro said. ''The medical society
says the only ethical obligation is to refer the patient. In the hospitals, they
don't require doctors to take AIDS patients. In the medical school, only a few
people were assigned to AIDS, and interns weren't required to go into the
clinic.''

Gordon Nary, director of the Physicans Association for AIDS Care, said such
failures pose ''a major moral and ethical dilemma.''

''We have people whose lives may be lengthened, whose lives may be saved,'' he
said, ''but who is going to take care of these patients?''

After 30 years as Managing Director of some of the UK's largest hearing aid
firms, Mark Moss knows what hearing aids should really cost. He also knows that
if you buy a cheap hearing aid without the proper advice and after-care - you
could find the aid is not so cheap after all. That's why he has now produced a
brochure to help people who are thinking of buying a hearing aid for the very
first time or considering an upgrade to a better model.

The fact is many people who suffer from hearing loss are reluctant to attempt to
buy a hearing aid because they find the whole process confusing and are not sure
where to find truly independent advice and the best prices.

Trustworthy Advice This is unfortunate because there are many professional
independent hearing aid dispensers who take great care and pride in providing
the latest hearing solutions for your individual needs. However, one national
chain is charging twice the price for a hearing aid than you can get with other
dispensers. Many large companies who employ dispensers are owned by Hearing Aid
Manufacturers chemists and opticians have also turned to selling hearing aids.

Nothing in either ear The market is changing and customers are getting younger,
buying digital aids for the mildest of hearing problem. Some simply want a tiny
corrector that will fit into the ear and not be noticed at all - so it is
practically invisible. Some hearing aids work without anything in the ear but by
using bone conduction through a pair of glasses. What is definite is that people
want something to alleviate their hearing loss but is so tiny that it cannot be
seen.

So before you even thinkof buying a hearing aid - make sure you're armed with
this revolutionary new FREE Hearing Aid Guide.

Who has the best price? Dear Consumer, "" I have compiled a comprehensive list
of prices of hearing aids in the United Kingdom and offer you my opinion for the
best dispenser and service in your area. Hearing aids are being offered at huge
discount prices but you must be assured of the right professional after-care.
There are now a wide range of aids and it is vital that you get the one that's
right for your specific needs.

At last. Prices are now falling for the latest digital aids.

Due to consumer led pressure prices are now falling for the latest digital
hearing aids as never before. My brochure tells you how you can get a proper aid
at a decent price AND ensure correct after care from a reliable dispenser.

Pakistan: World AIDS Day to mark those died deadly disease

LENGTH: 480 words

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD


ISLAMABAD, Dec. 2 -- The United Nations' (UN) World AIDS Day will be observed on
December 1st all over the world including Pakistan to honor those who have died
of AIDS and those who live with HIV or AIDS and to increase awareness of these
conditions.

AIDS is a condition resulting from damages done to the human immune system by
HIV. It affects tens of millions of people around the world.

The theme of World AIDS Day 2011 is "Getting to Zero": zero new infections, zero
discrimination and zero AIDS-related deaths".

"Heading into the fourth decade of AIDS, we are finally in a position to end the
epidemic. The progress we have made so far is roof that we can realize our
vision [of getting to zero," said UN Secretary General Ban-Ki Moon in a press
release on World AIDS Day.

Earlier this year, the UN General Assembly High-Level Meeting on AIDS created
goals to reach by 2015: a 50% reduction in the sexual transmission of HIV, no
new infections in children, antiretroviral therapy (ART) for 15 million people
living with HIV, ending stigma and discrimination and closing the AIDS funding
gap.

World AIDS Day is the focal point of the World AIDS Campaign, which is active
all year round. During the days and weeks leading up to World AIDS Day, there
was a lot of coverage of the condition in the media and fundraising for AIDS and
HIV-related charities.

In addition, health education campaigns aiming to reduce the transmission of HIV
and discrimination of people living with HIV and AIDS are often launched on or
around December 1.

On World AIDS Day, many community, national and international leaders issue
proclamations on supporting and treating people living with HIV and AIDS and
stimulating research into the treatment of these conditions.

Local communities hold events to remember and honor members who have died of
AIDS-related conditions or exhibitions around the subject.

AIDS stands for "acquired immune deficiency syndrome" or "acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome" and denotes a condition, which results from the
damage done by HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) to the immune system. The
condition was first identified in 1981 and

the name "AIDS" was first introduced on July 27, 1982.

There has been a lot of stigma around the spread of HIV and people living with
HIV and AIDS. It has been estimated that around 33 million people around the
world have been infected with

HIV and that around two million people die from AIDS related conditions each
year.

On October 27, 1988, the UN General Assembly officially recognized that the
World Health Organization declared December 1, 1988, to be World AIDS Day. World
AIDS Day has also been observed on this date each year since then Published by

ABSTRACT

Two-thirds of aid professionals said in a survey that they had moderate or
severe shortages of resources like staff, money, and technology.

FULL TEXT

Spend some time with financial-aid administrators, and you'll probably hear that
they are overworked and underresourced. Because aid professionals make those
points so often, it can be easy to dismiss them. Their professional association
hopes to change that with a new report showing that many financial-aid offices
are experiencing long-term resource shortages, which are limiting their ability
to counsel students and comply with regulations.

The report, "Findings from the 2010 Nasfaa Administrative Burden Survey," was
released on Monday by the National Association of Student Financial Aid
Administrators. It is based on 677 complete and 405 partial responses to a
survey given to member colleges in October 2010.

Two-thirds of responding aid professionals said their offices were experiencing
either a "moderate" resource shortage, affecting peak aid-processing times, or a
"severe" shortage, affecting day-to-day work. "Resource shortage" covers such
things as insufficient budgets, staff, or technology, says Justin Draeger, the
association's president.

It was a good time for the association to do such a survey, says the chairman of
the association's federal-issues committee. "What's brought some of this to the
forefront has been our own miniversion of a perfect storm in our profession,"
says Craig D. Munier, who is also director of the office of scholarships and
financial aid at the University of Nebraska at Lincoln. Mr. Munier cites
increased Congressional focus on college access, state budget cuts, growing
enrollments, and a reluctance to spend tuition revenue on administrative
overhead as components of that storm.

At Michigan State University, the financial-aid office's operating budget has
been cut over the last several years, and is now at the same level it was in
2006, says Rick Shipman, its director. In 2005, Mr. Shipman, who is also a
member of the association's federal-issues committee, had 45 full-time staff
members; he now has 39. And all this has happened at a time when many more
students are applying and qualifying for aid.

The office has made better use of technology, Mr. Shipman says, by giving
students more online tools. But that doesn't help families whose financial
circumstances have changed or those who have an unusual situation, two groups
that have grown in recent years. The office has seen an increase in job losses,
Mr. Shipman says. Then there are entirely new situations, like the families who
have two houses-not because one is a summer home, but because a parent who got a
new job in a different city could not sell the old house.

Jim White, dean of student financial services at Gonzaga University, does not
describe his office as experiencing a shortage, though its operating budget of
about $70,000 (not including salaries) has been reduced by about $5,000. The
financial-aid office saved that money by making greater use of online
communication, which lowered printing costs.

At a tuition-dependent private college like his, Mr. White says, admissions and
financial aid are likely to be the last administrative offices to face a cut. He
believes that state colleges are in a tighter spot. "We do have adequate
resources to do what we need to do," he says.

Gonzaga has seen more requests for aid, and Mr. White says his office benefited
from hiring an additional person about three years ago. Without that modest
staff increase, his office would have struggled to keep up.

Financial-aid offices are not the only offices that are experiencing resource
shortages. But, Mr. Draeger says, federal regulations require colleges to
provide enough staff to administer Title IV student-aid programs and to
adequately counsel participating students, which make shortages especially
problematic for aid offices.

The shortages aid offices confront are not just a result of the weak economy.
Increases in aid applications and reviews of special financial circumstances
were some of the main drivers identified by survey respondents. So, too, was a
greater regulatory or compliance workload, something unlikely to change as the
economy improves. Eighty percent of respondents who reported a shortage said
they expected it to be permanent.

Effect on Students

Those shortages, aid administrators reported, cut into their efforts to help
students. Of those who reported a shortage, nearly 61 percent say it had "some"
effect on their ability to meet obligations to students, and about 27 percent
say it had a "significant" impact. Face-to-face counseling, phone contact,
outreach efforts, and e-mail contact were among the areas the largest share of
respondents said were affected.

"The one thing that's been identified over and over again as having the most
positive effect of keeping students out of excessive debt is one of the first
things to be thrown out when a school is under administrative and regulatory
burden," Mr. Draeger says of student counseling. "That's why financial-aid
administrators want to be vocal about the difficulties they are experiencing."

Mr. Shipman, of Michigan State, knows exactly what he would do with more
resources: "The No. 1 thing we'd do a better job with is answering phone calls,"
he says.

During the summer, the busiest time of the year, the office receives some 9,000
calls a month. And those are just the ones that make it into its system, which
blocks new calls when full capacity has been reached. To answer those calls, Mr.
Shipman has only four staff members and however many temporary workers he can
afford to hire (last year it was seven). Sometimes the temps need help with
especially complicated calls.

In other words, his staff can't hope to answer every call, or even half of them.
"Our goal is, No matter how long a person waits to get through to us, when they
get through to us, they have the best possible experience," Mr. Shipman says.

Dan Davenport, director of student financial-aid services at the University of
Idaho, is concerned about his office's ability to help students whose financial
circumstances have changed. "The thing that worries me the most is: Are there
students out there that have that situation and give up before they talk to us?"
says Mr. Davenport, who is also on the association's federal-issues committee.
With a flat staff level and slashed operating budget at a time when aid
applications are through the roof, he says, "we've lost the ability to be as
proactive as we have to be."

A majority of aid administrators who reported a resource shortage said it cut
into their ability to stay on top of compliance-particularly keeping up with new
Title IV regulations, responding to Notices of Proposed Rulemaking, and
monitoring current Title IV regulations.

Some colleges with very small aid offices, Mr. Davenport believes, simply can't
stay on top of the regulations despite their best efforts.

Though Gonzaga has a relatively small financial-aid office, Mr. White says
compliance is easier for him than for many of his counterparts because staff in
other departments also monitor relevant compliance issues. Nonetheless,
compliance takes up about 40 percent of his time.

At Michigan State, Mr. Shipman has a staff person devoted to compliance,
something that would not be possible for most smaller offices. That staff member
must keep on top of regulations universitywide, since taking away Title IV aid
is the federal government's main stick in ensuring compliance. The university
does a good job in compliance, says Mr. Shipman, noting that there were no
findings against it in its last review.

"There are so many new regulations we have to follow, and they're so conflicted,
and, I'd say, contradictory, in many places," Mr. Shipman says.

Recently, a question arose in his office: What are the financial-aid
implications for a student with a disability that allows him to enroll part time
and have it count as full time? He and his colleagues had to turn to the
regulations for the answer. In some aid programs, they found, such a student can
get aid on a full-time basis, but not in others.

The time it takes to have such discussions is time diverted from other duties.
"When you're reading and interpreting regulations, it means you're not
processing aid, and that's the reason we're here," Mr. Shipman says.

Policy Recommendations

In response to the survey findings and previous research, the association has
made several policy recommendations. It advocates streamlining the federal
financial-aid system to one grant, one loan, and one campus-based program. The
group also suggests increasing the amount of money colleges receive to
administer the Pell Grant program.

The association wants to simplify the financial-aid application process by
allowing students and families who do not have to file taxes (because of their
low income) or who receive means-tested federal benefits to automatically
qualify for the maximum Pell Grant. It also suggests removing all non-financial-
aid questions, like those about Selective Service registration and drug
convictions, from the financial-aid application. The association suggests
creating a tool to help families estimate their financial-aid eligibility when
their children are still young. It wants students to be able to use
prior-prior-year tax data to apply for aid, which would allow more families to
populate their aid forms with IRS data. And the association suggests allowing
aid administrators to make professional-judgment adjustments for similar groups
of students, instead of only on a case-by-case basis.

In addition, the association wants to remove some regulations so aid
professionals have more time to work with students. It suggests simplifying Pell
Grant regulations, streamlining consumer-information requirements, using the
same annual loan limits for all students regardless of class standing, and
simplifying the return of federal aid for students who have withdrawn.

"There seems to be now a bipartisan agreement that overregulating can stymie
economic growth," Mr. Draeger says. "My hope is that there's some bipartisan
recognition that regulations can also stymie college access or can hinder our
efforts on college affordability."

WHEN IT SOUNDS LIKE TIME FOR A HEARING AID

BYLINE: >BY EVANGELINE MITCHELL

SECTION: LA.COM; Pg. L15

LENGTH: 1063 words


If your hearing isn't as good as it used to be, you may be thinking about
getting a hearing aid.

Then again, there's a good chance you can't be bothered, even though you find
yourself cranking up the volume on the TV set, or asking a friend sitting next
to you to speak up. If so, you are not alone.

More often than not, people put off getting a hearing aid after they first
notice it's getting harder to hear, said audiologist Leigh Kjeldsen ``People
wait an average of seven years between knowing they have a problem with hearing
and doing something about it.''

Why the wait?

``People don't know about the process and don't know where to begin,'' said
Kjeldsen, owner of Valley Audiology, which has offices in Concord and Walnut
Creek.

The first step is to get your hearing tested by a hearing professional. That's
followed by more evaluations to help the patient determine what type of hearing
aid would best fit his or her hearing needs. Once a hearing aid is selected,
there is a fitting, which involves adjusting the hearing aid to best meet the
patient's hearing needs. Often, patients come back for further adjustments after
the initial fitting.

While a hearing aid can indeed improve your life by improving your ability to
hear, they are not cheap. The cost of a quality analog hearing aid can go from
$900 to $1,200, while a digital aid can range from $1,300 to $3,000, according
to the Mayo Clinic Web site. And that's just for one.

``Some people need, one, some people need two,'' depending on their hearing
needs, said Kjeldsen.

Digital hearing aids, which are programmed by a computer, allow for more
flexibility and fine-tuning of the hearing aid so that it can be adjusted to
hearing fluctuations of the user as well as different hearing environments.

``Hearing aids -- nowadays I like to think of them as miniature computers. They
are programmed for each individual's hearing loss ... It's not one size fits
all. ... Once the hearing aid is programmed it can be reprogrammed,'' said
Robert Green, an audiologist at Alta Bates Summit Medical Center.

Today, requests for analog hearing aids are rare, said Kjeldsen.

``Just about all the hearing aids sold these days are digital,'' she said. ``I
would say in the last five years there have been incredible advances in what a
(digital) hearing aid can do.''

Hearing aids cover a wide range when it comes to prices.

``People need to know there is a very wide range of cost per hearing aid and
that all depends on the level of technology,'' said Green. Smaller, less visible
hearing aids tend to cost more than larger ones, he said.

Hearing aids may need to be replaced after several years of use to accommodate a
person's changing hearing needs. However, digital aids have more flexibility
when it comes to programming to adapt to a person's changing hearing needs.

Not only are hearing aids expensive, but Medicare won't pay for them. That means
people have to either buy a hearing aid as an out-of-pocket expense, or have
supplemental Medicare or retiree insurance to help foot the bill. Some financial
assistance programs to help people buy hearing aids may be available from
nonprofit and government agencies.

Hearing loss affects more than 28 million Americans, including nearly 6 million
children.

With baby boomers starting to turn 60 last year, the number of people with
hearing loss is expected to nearly double by the year 2030, according to the
Hearing Loss Association of America. The likelihood of losing your hearing
increases as you get older, with up to one in three people older than 65 having
some kind of hearing loss, according to the association.

Although 95 percent of Americans with a hearing loss can be successfully treated
with hearing aids, only 22 percent (or 6.35 million individuals) currently use
them.

``Hearings aids are very expensive, so a lot of people are convinced they are
not going to get value for what the are paying. There is a lot of skepticism,''
said Green.

``What is at the heart of this whole process is whether or not the person (with
the hearing problem) is actually ready for (a hearing aid). She is the one who
is going to wear it. She is the one who has to make the decision. ... It's not
something people are kind of excited about, but for a lot of people it's a
necessity.''

Mitchell writes for the Contra Costa Times.

Hearing aid help

To find an audiologist near you, go to www.audiology.org.

More information is also available from the Hearing Loss Association of America.
Go to www.hearingloss.org or call (301) 657-2248. The TTY number is (301)
657-2249.

Go to www.mayoclinic.com and type in hearing aids in the search box.

Before you buy

1. Read your sales contract carefully. Make sure you understand everything. Your
signature on a contract is your commitment to fulfill the terms of that
contract. Take someone with you to give you a second review of the contract.

2. Verify whether your hearing aid dispenser has a current and valid license.

3. A properly fitted hearing aid can amplify sound and enrich your life, but it
cannot restore permanently lost hearing, prevent further hearing loss, or cure
dizzy spells.

4. Before you complete your purchase, be certain your contract specifies the
refund and warranty provisions.

5. Financial assistance may be available. If your dispenser is unable to direct
you to a source of financial assistance, write or call your local United Way,
Department of Veterans Affairs, or the state health department.

6. Check your state laws. Some states require a 30-day warranty on new and used
hearing aids sold. Buyers may also be able to return the hearing aid for a
refund, adjustment or replacement of the hearing aid. Check your local
regulations.

Types of hearing aids

Basic analog: This conventional technology amplifies all sounds equally. Your
audiologist sets the amplification level, though it can be adjusted later. Basic
analog is the least expensive.

Programmable analog: The programmability of this technology means that your
audiologist can adjust these devices to amplify different kinds of sounds at
different levels.

Digital: With this type of technology, a computer chip converts the incoming
sound into a digital code, then analyzes and adjusts the sound based on your
hearing loss and listening needs. The result is sound that's more finely tuned
to your hearing loss.

Activists fighting apathy over AIDS

BYLINE: By LISA LIDDANE, The Orange County Register

Sylvia Mata remembers a time when AIDS was the cause du jour in Orange County.

In the late 1980s and early '90s, locals swapped stories about how horrific it
was to die from the disease. Celebrities and others with deep pockets raised
tens of thousands of dollars for local AIDS organizations. And, back then,
people in Orange County and elsewhere mistakenly thought of AIDS as only a gay
man's disease.

But now, 25 years since the government announced the first documented case of
AIDS, the local spotlight has dimmed. And Mata, chairwoman of the Orange County
HIV Planning Council, says funds for programs on AIDS/HIV prevention, detection
and quality of life are at risk.

``People are more concerned about bird flu than they are about AIDS.''

Others working to combat the disease agree.

``It's unknown how much federal money will be allocated to Orange County for
AIDS- and HIV-related efforts,'' says Alan Witchey, executive director of AIDS
Services Foundation Orange County, the largest nonprofit group in the county to
receive federal funds to fight AIDS.

Such funds have been disbursed in previous years under the Ryan White
Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency Act. The money goes to programs designed
to mitigate the burden of AIDS and HIV on the health-care system. But Congress
is slated to review revisions to the act, and may reduce the money given to
counties that demonstrate declining AIDS rates.

Whether any cutbacks will touch Orange County is debatable. New AIDS cases are
declining locally. But HIV cases continue to rise. Mata says medications are
helping people survive the disease, but not without difficulties coping with
side effects.

The uncertainty makes fundraising events such as the AIDS Walk Sunday in Irvine
more critical than ever, Witchey said.

The 20-year old annual event aims to raise at least $700,000 to be distributed
among nine local organizations, including HIV prevention public programs at UC
Irvine and AEGiS.org , a nonprofit HIV and AIDS database out of San Juan Cap
istrano.

Mata, 46, who has been living with HIV for a decade, knows firsthand how
important such programs are. ``If it weren't for funds for these programs, I
wouldn't be alive today,'' she said.

Witchey noted that local programs have evolved over the years to serve a wide
spectrum of people, reflecting the fact that AIDS affects straight and gay
people of every color, gender, racial, age or socioeconomic level.

In Orange County, Latinos and women are the fastest- growing groups infected
with HIV, according to county health reports. Since 2000, AIDS cases among women
increased 50 percent, compared with 3.3 percent for men. For the first time in
the county, Latinos in 2005 led whites in reported AIDS cases.

``There's a whole generation of kids who don't know anything about AIDS in the
'80s and the scariness of it all,'' Mata said. ``They weren't born yet.''

People have become complacent about preventing HIV transmission because they
think they can just take a pill if they get infected, she added.

``When people think of AIDS, they think of it in the global sense. But AIDS is
local. It's in our front yard.''

From 1981 to 2005, 3,393 people in Orange County with AIDS have died. 51 percent
of people with AIDS have died.

The number of people living with AIDS grew from 1,779 in 1995 to 3,278 in 2005.

There were 165 new AIDS cases in 2005, a 22 percent decrease from 212 in 2004.
Of these new cases, 146 were men, 19 were women.

There were 2,066 total HIV cases from July 2002 -- when California began
tracking HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. People are living longer with HIV
because of medications.

Of the 385 new cases of HIV infection in 2005, 335 were men, 50 were women.

In a state of AIDS denial: Epidemic of anger: Nearly one in 10 South Africans
has the virus that causes AIDS. Yet their president continues to court a fringe
group of researchers that insists the disease doesn't even exist

DATELINE: Johannesburg

When David Rasnick, an obscure California biochemist, answered his cell phone
recently, he scarcely could have imagined that the call would touch off the
world's latest -- and perhaps most bizarre -- controversy over the nature of
AIDS.

"A voice came on the line and said it was Thabo Mbeki," Rasnick recalled, naming
South Africa's president. "I didn't believe it at first. I didn't know
presidents just called out of the blue like that."

Apparently, when it comes to AIDS, Mbeki does. And for 15 minutes, the African
leader quizzed Rasnick about his work at the University of California at
Berkeley.

"He was checking me out, seeing if I was legitimate," Rasnick said. "I suppose I
passed his test, because he asked me for my personal support of his anti-AIDS
efforts and I gave it to him."

Trouble is, more than 99 per cent of the world's other AIDS experts would have
flunked Rasnick. Along with a tiny group of other so-called "dissident"
researchers, Rasnick espouses the radical view that AIDS simply does not exist.
The deadly disease the world calls AIDS is not linked to the infamous virus
known as HIV, he insists, but instead is merely a collection of more mundane
illnesses linked to recreational drug use and malnutrition.

To argue otherwise, he maintains, is to be duped by a vast conspiracy among
governments, drug firms and mainstream scientists who are milking billions of
dollars from the "AIDS industry."

News of Mbeki's quiet consultations with American AIDS skeptics earlier this
year became public only a few weeks ago, but the uproar it has sparked in South
Africa has been explosive.

Activists in South Africa and abroad have attacked Mbeki's administration for
flirting with pseudo-science instead of facing the ruinous AIDS crisis in South
Africa, where some 4 million people, or nearly 10 per cent of the population,
are infected with HIV. The scandal has plunged the nation's already troubled
AIDS policy into further confusion. And bewildered scientists worldwide are
scratching their heads over why South Africa would choose to breathe new life
into a discredited hypothesis that they fear will only hamper global efforts to
combat the dread disease.

"All President Mbeki is saying is let's listen to everybody," said Parks
Mankahlana, a spokesperson for Mbeki, who has ordered a blue-ribbon panel be
organized in South Africa to re-evaluate the evidence behind the global AIDS
epidemic.

"Let's not silence one group or another with hysterical declarations,"
Mankahlana said. "To find a solution to this thing we have to look at all
angles."

Including, evidently, those who doubt the very existence of AIDS. Peter
Duesberg, a Berkeley colleague of Rasnick and a leader of the AIDS skeptics'
camp, has been invited to attend the panel.

So far, health organizations such as UNAIDS and the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention have shunned direct comment on South Africa's wooing of
AIDS doubters. But in the past few weeks, both agencies released stinging
statements denouncing the AIDS dissidents' position, labelling it a "myth."

"I consider those guys real evil characters," said an angry World Health
Organization official in Geneva. "By denying the link between HIV and AIDS,
they're undoing 20 years of public health efforts. Why would anyone want to give
them this credibility?"

Taking into account Mbeki's actions, many scientists are weighing whether they
should stay away from the International AIDS Conference, scheduled for July in
South Africa. They fear if the AIDS doubters are included in the assemblage,
their views will be given undue credibility and world attention.

Mbeki's Long History of Stirring AIDS Controversy

Actually, neither Mbeki's apparent fascination with the more arcane scientific
debates surrounding AIDS nor the views of AIDS skeptics such as Rasnick and
Duesberg are anything new.

In 1997, when he was still deputy president, Mbeki touted an alleged South
African cure for AIDS called Virodene. The drug has quietly faded from the
public scene.

And last year, after succeeding President Nelson Mandela in the nation's second
democratic elections, Mbeki again became embroiled in controversy when he
publicly questioned the safety of AZT, an anti-retroviral drug widely used in
the developed world to block the transmission of HIV from mother to child.
Health experts say as many as 5,000 South African babies are born HIV positive
every month, fuelling the fastest-growing disease infection rate in the world.

Mbeki, who has made clear his contempt for the international pharmaceutical
industry -- "the profit takers who are benefiting from the scourge of HIV/AIDS,"
his office recently called them -- apparently stumbled into his latest AIDS
controversy while surfing the Internet.

One of the prominent AIDS dissident Web sites belongs to Duesberg, a professor
of molecular and cell biology who shares his lab with Rasnick at Berkeley.

In it, articles with headlines such as "AIDS not infectious -- but caused by
recreational and anti-HIV drugs" outline the dissident manifesto: that "various
AIDS diseases are brought on by the long-term consumption of recreational drugs
and AZT" and other drugs that treat AIDS.

In essence, Duesberg declares that despite thousands of medical studies, there
is still no conclusive proof that HIV causes AIDS.

Further, he asserts that the scientific establishment is cynically propagating
AIDS with the very anti-retroviral drugs used to treat it. And as for AIDS in
Africa, where 70 per cent of the world's people with HIV live and where almost
nobody has access to expensive drugs such as AZT, the skeptics argue the AIDS
phenomenon is caused by common ailments linked to hunger and poverty.

Duesberg's Web site points out his funding has dried up as a result of his
scientific heresy.

"I assume that the many beneficiaries of (the accepted AIDS) hypothesis are now
concerned that, for the first time, a head of state who is independent of the
U.S. government has called this unproductive and potentially very detrimental
hypothesis into question," Duesberg said of Mbeki's recent actions.

Rasnick, who has been in touch with Mbeki by e-mail well as phone, is even more
pointed.

"What's behind all these shrill attacks on Mbeki?" said the biochemist, who
belongs to an AIDS dissident group that claims 600 members. "It's thousands of
activists and scientists who fear they're going to be out of a billion-dollar
business."

What the world's AIDS community seems to be registering in this strange debate,
however, isn't so much fear as genuine bafflement.

"If these are the persons Mbeki is consulting, then it is absolutely worrisome
for South Africa," said Andrew Leigh-Brown, a pioneering AIDS geneticist at the
University of Edinburgh who challenged the dissidents' assertions a decade ago,
when they first emerged.

"What we're talking about here is a very small group of people who ... choose to
ignore the vast, accumulated bulk of scientific evidence," Leigh-Brown said.
"They're flat-Earthers. It's nonsense."

Among the studies proving the HIV-AIDS link, he cited five years of anti-HIV
drug trials that largely have emptied hospitals of AIDS patients in the
developed world. In Africa, he noted that condom use has cut AIDS rates, showing
the disease is, in fact, sexually transmissible.

So noisy has the outcry against Mbeki's contact with AIDS skeptics become, in
fact, that his office issued a terse statement this month that "the president
has never said that HIV does not cause AIDS."

"I feel truly embarrassed for my government," said Malegapuru Makgoba, an
immunologist and president of the Medical Research Council of South Africa. "It
makes us look absolutely lost, under siege."

Many in South Africa, where the debate over AIDS has become so poisoned that the
government's concrete efforts -- such as condom distribution and education
campaigns -- have been utterly eclipsed by controversy, seem to feel the same
way.

"Mbeki's panel? Who the hell cares?" said Charlene Smith, an AIDS activist who
says 75 per cent of pediatric deaths at Johannesburg public hospitals, which are
patronized by low-income families, are now AIDS-related.

"We're dying down here," Smith said bitterly. "Play all the intellectual games
you want on the Internet, but we're dying down here."

Study findings support belief that HIV is cause of AIDS

BYLINE: By DR WILLIAM REVILLE

SECTION: HOME NEWS; SCIENCE TODAY; Pg. 2

LENGTH: 1115 words


IT IS widely believed by medical researchers that the Acquired Immune Deficiency
Syndrome (AIDS) is caused by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). This
picture has been vigorously challenged by a small number of scientists
principally Prof Peter Duesberg.

Duesberg claims that HIV is a harmless passenger virus and that the primary
cause of AIDS is the greatly increased use of recreational drugs by society.
However, a recent epidemiological study of a large group of British
haemophiliacs strongly bolsters the case that HIV does cause AIDS (Nature, vol
377, page 79, September, 1995).

Our bodies are equipped with a natural defence mechanism called the immune
system, which protects us against a wide range of potentially harmful microbes
and other agents that invade the body.  If the immune system was badly weakened,
or eliminated, we would quickly succumb to infection, with fatal consequences.
In AIDS the immune system comes under attack and is severely weakened, leading
to the inevitable consequences.

It is believed that HIV causes AIDS by attacking a vital component of the immune
system called T calls. There is a long latent period, from several to many
years, between infection with HIV and the onset of AIDS. No disease symptoms are
present during the latent period.

When the immune system becomes sufficiently weakened, the body is defenceless
against infections that it normally could fight off pneumonia, diarrhoea, etc.
Cancerous tumours are common. One of these diseases eventually kills the
patient.

There is no known cure for AIDS. A person is infected with HIV when his/her
blood comes into direct contact with the blood of a carrier of HIV.

There is a considerable amount of evidence that HIV causes AIDS, and I am aware
of no evidence that AIDS is caused by any other microbe. HIV does attack the
immune system and is almost always present in cases of AIDS.

The focus of the medical battle against AIDS is to develop /discover agents that
will inactivate HIV, and, in the longer term, to develop a vaccine that will
protect against infection by HIV.

The primary purpose of all biological life is to propagate itself into future
generations. Viruses are the simplest forms of biological "life" and are
composed basically of some nucleic acid housed within a protein coat. They can
only propagate themselves by using the resources of living cells in the host(s)
they infect.

Therefore a virus that finds it difficult to infect its host, and/or kills its
host quickly before it can successfully spread itself to many other hosts, will
not survive long.

Duesberg claims that not even one of the health care workers who treated more
than 401,000 American AIDS victims over the last 10 years contracted AIDS from a
patient despite the absence of a vaccine or effective drug. He concludes that no
infectious agent that is so difficult to transmit could survive as a microbe.

Duesberg also points out that if HIV is a blood borne virus, one would expect
that recipients of HIV from transfusion would develop all AIDS defining
diseases, one of which is an otherwise rare form of cancer called Kaposi's
sarcoma. Yet nobody ever developed AIDS Kaposi's sarcoma from a transfusion.

The great majority of viruses don't cause disease, e.g., adenovirus. Such
viruses are called passenger viruses and this is how Duesberg views HIV. A
passenger virus is usually present, but may be absent during a disease.

Duesberg points to the 4,621 HIV free cases of AIDS reported in the literature.
Duesberg claims that HIV is harmless and boasts that he would inject himself
with HIV to prove the point if it could be guaranteed that the virus was not
contaminated with any other agent.  If Duesberg is right the search for a
medical cure for AIDS is aimed at the wrong target (HIV), and billions of pounds
are being wasted.

Duesberg proposes that the outbreak of AIDS in America and Europe over the last
15 years was caused by the long term consumption of illegal recreational drugs
and by AZT (a drug used to treat AIDS). He believes that long term drug abuse
gradually weakens the immune system, eventually producing AIDS.

He sees haemophilia AIDS and transfusion AIDS simply as a normal background
incidence of AIDS defining diseases, and "African AIDS" as a new name for old
diseases caused by malnutrition, infections and poor sanitation. Duesberg also
claims that death rates among HIV infected haemophiliacs in the US do not
support the theory that HIV causes AIDS. However, the recent UK study, reported
later, would seem to demolish this point.

Duesberg claims that the drug theory explains US and European AIDS precisely. He
makes the following main points (a) since 1981, 95 per cent of all American AIDS
cases have been from risk groups that have used such drugs mostly intravenous
drug users and male homosexuals (b) American AIDS predominantly affects males
because they are the principal users of drugs (c) American AIDS is new because
the drug epidemic is new e.g., amphetamine consumption rose 100 fold from 1980
to 1990 (d) only a small fraction of drug users get AIDS. The "latent period" is
the time it takes for drug abuse to sufficiently weaken the immune system to
allow AIDS to take over (e) specific drugs cause specific AIDS defining diseases
Kaposi's Syndrome is 20 times more common in male homosexual AIDS cases, who use
nitrite inhalants to facilitate sexual contacts (f) 80 per cent of paediatric
AIDS cases are born to mothers who were intravenous drug users during pregnancy.

The recent epidemiological study published in Nature offers strong evidence that
HIV causes AIDS 6,278 men in the UK diagnosed with haemophilia between 1977 and
1991 were studied 1,227 were infected with HIV (through treatment with
contaminated blood products between 1979 and 1988.

The study found that mortality among those infected by HIV increased more than
10 fold while remaining unchanged over time in those who escaped infection. Most
of the excess deaths in the HIV group were due to AIDS or conditions known to be
associated with AIDS.

There is no doubt that HIV is a marker for those at risk of developing AIDS.
However, a number of researchers have modified their original belief that HIV is
the exclusive cause of AIDS, and now propose that the virus works in conjunction
with some essential co factor(s). Only a small number of scientists accept
Duesberg's position.

It must be acknowledged that his argument strikingly highlights the concurrence
of AIDS and drug use. Nevertheless, despite Duesberg's arguments, the evidence
that HIV is centrally involved in causing AIDS appears compelling.

Ottawa to spend $129 million to fight AIDS

BYLINE: By Kelly Toughill Toronto Star

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A27

LENGTH: 776 words


   Ottawa will pour another $129 million into the fight against AIDS over the
next five years, Health Minister Jake Epp has announced.

Speaking in Winnipeg, Epp announced a new national AIDS program that will
quadruple federal spending on the battle against the epidemic.

"It is imperative that we control the progression of AIDS in the Canadian
population," said Epp, who described acquired immune deficiency syndrome as "one
of the most serious health issues facing governments around the world."

The new program comes on top of a $39-million, five-year plan that was launched
in 1986 and widely criticized by AIDS researchers and activists.

It brings federal spending on AIDS education, research and special services to
$168 million over seven years. It also calls for a national AIDS awareness
campaign.

"This means that the government of Canada is taking a much higher profile in the
battle against AIDS," Epp said later in a telephone interview. "This is a good
program, a good response for now."

More drugs

Epp said the program means the public will be better educated about the disease,
therefore better able to protect themselves against it. He said it will also
mean better care and more drugs for those who have AIDS.

AIDS researchers lauded Epp's plan.

"It shows there is a real commitment now from Ottawa," said Dr. Norbert Gilmore,
chairman of the National AIDS Advisory Committee. "The government has finally
put its money on the table and said let's get on with it."

"This is a very good boost, a very significant enhancement," said David Walters,
of the Canadian Public Health Association. "It recognizes that now is the time
to spend money to fight AIDS, instead of pouring money into the health system
down the road."

"It's a very good start, a very encouraging sign," said Dr. Cate Hankins, of
Montreal.

"However there is no way to evaluate whether it will be enough. Five years ago
we had no clue what we would need today. We don't know what we'll need five
years from now."

'Not enough'

AIDS activists were less enthusiastic about the plan.

"We are of two minds," said Phil Shaw, of the AIDS Committee of Toronto. "On one
hand we appreciate the serious nature of the commitment. But on the other, it
comes very late and it's still not enough."

The new plan includes:

* $48 million for education, including a national AIDS awareness campaign.

* $35 million for scientific research, including work on an AIDS vaccine and new
drug treatments.

* $20 million for AIDS prevention and special care for those who are ill, to be
funnelled through private organizations such as support groups and hospices.

* $10 million to train health workers, develop new ways to care for AIDS
patients and start AIDS training in the workplace.

* $10 million to run the program and develop AIDS policies.

* $6 million for international AIDS efforts.

By comparison, President Ronald Reagan proposed $1.3 billion (U.S.) for AIDS
research when he announced his 1989 budget earlier this year.

AIDS is caused by a virus that destroys the body's immune system, leaving a
person vulnerable to other infections.

In Canada, 1,775 people have been diagnosed with AIDS, of whom 993 have died. In
Ontario, 698 cases have been reported.

It is estimated that up to 50,000 Canadians carry the AIDS virus. Scientists
believe that everyone who carries the virus eventually will develop the fatal
disease.

Committee broke

Epp's announcement comes just three weeks after protesters marched through
downtown Toronto demanding the government step up its efforts against the
epidemic. One group burned Epp in effigy outside City Hall.

Leaders of the Federal Centre for AIDS recently admitted that vital research
projects were being put off for lack of money. The government's own AIDS
advisory committee hasn't met in six months because it was broke.

Michael Lynch, founder of AIDS Action Now, complained that not enough money was
set aside in the new plan for developing treatments.

"It's a very small amount set aside for treating those who are infected," he
said. "At least half the funds should have gone toward new treatments."

Epp said the program will help speed up the approval process for experimental
AIDS drugs, a key demand of many AIDS activists.

"There are no guarantees, but it will put those drugs on a fast track," Epp
said. "There will always be people who say it's not enough, but I feel I've done
the right thing."

Walters pointed out that the new initiative falls short of recommendations in a
recent study by the Royal Society of Canada.

Spending earns criticism   Group says aid begins at home

BYLINE: MICHAEL McDOWELL; GAM

LENGTH: 717 words


By  MICHAEL McDOWELL
    Foreign Aid Begins at Home reads the slogan of Citizens for Foreign Aid
 Reform.

"If Canadians feel their money is helping the really poor of the world  they
will always give." - Rev. Robert Ogle MP, New Democratic Party aid  spokesman.

Public interest in the Third World has been muted by high unemployment
 but overseas aid is still a passionate concern of figures at both ends of
 the Canadian political spectrum.

Rev. Robert Ogle, the NDP aid critic, is one such figure. A former
 missionary priest who worked for six years in remote areas of Brazil,
 Father Ogle accuses the Government of a lack of direction in aid policy:
 "Government aid policy is very vague. The act of aid is something that
 requires a long-haul commitment, longer than days or months.
    "Development doesn't come from quick results. Giving a man a dime on
 the street is a one-shot thing . . . following through on human
 development could take 30 years."
    Since he has been in Ottawa, he complains, the Canadian International
 Development Agency has had three presidents. The post was vacant from
 October, 1982, to September, 1983.

Father Ogle charges that the Government has given aid low priority,
 making it difficult to have a vigorous aid philosophy in Canada in the
 1980s.
    "Given a will by the Government, disillusion with Canadian aid can be
 turned around. I would say I have never seen a good story about CIDA. Aid
 has got to be marketed to the Canadian community as a good thing for
 Canada."
    He says CIDA has too many "troops" in its Hull "fortress," creating
 public doubts about its efficiency. "People should be in the field making
 rapid decisions - aid given quickly is aid given twice."
    On the other side of the debate is Citizens for Foreign Aid Reform - C-
 FAR - whose members include some of CIDA's most virulent opponents.
 Spokesman Paul Fromm says he became a critic of Canada's foreign aid
 policies as a reaction to the "hard-sell guilt" he accuses the churches of
 trying to arouse among Canadians in the 1960s.
    "I was revolted by the assertion that the Third World was poorer
 because we were eating steak . . . Canada has no reason to feel guilty . .
 . being a nice guy has not won us respect. Most of the Third World still
 hates us," he says.

Canadian aid should be restricted to countries with a free enterprise
 philosophy - and should never go to socialist states, he said.
    "Aid to any other type of economy is a waste because (socialist)
 economics stand in the way of development."
    Poverty, according to Mr. Fromm, is a result of "socialist government"
 in many ways.
    "In general, these countries are ideologically hostile to us. They
 don't have in place the ability to make use of the aid."
    C-FAR would confine aid to disaster relief, regardless of ideology and,
 in general terms, to nations with a free-enterprise system. The
 organization would cut all aid to multilateral bodies such as the United
 Nations because, says Mr. Fromm, "Canada should get the credit for the aid
 we dispose," and distribute aid through non-governmental organizations
 instead.

He questions whether aid has done the Third World any good at all.
 While accepting that medical aid has reduced infant mortality, for
 instance, he says it "should have been coupled with family planning."
    The dollars given in overseas aid would be better spent at home
 subsidizing mortgages or loans for small businesses and farms, he adds.

While Mr. Fromm would restrict Canadian aid to capitalist economies,
 Robert Carty and Virginia Smith, authors of a recent book on Canadian aid
 policy, advocate restricting it to popularly supported governments who
 "seriously want to eradicate poverty at its roots in a self-reliant way.
    "Development assistance should not be given to any underdeveloped
 country that maintains gross social inequalities," they write.

The only justifiable purpose in giving aid is to assist Third World  countries
in their struggle to develop, say Mr. Carty and Miss Smith, who  call on CIDA to
untie Canada's bilateral aid and drop what they describe  as its "charade of
trying to meet development and commercial objectives  simultaneously . . .
ending the hypocrisy of calling export promotion,  surplus food disposal and
public subsidization of private corporations  'aid.' "

In Texas, AIDS Struggle Is Also Matter of Money

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

SECTION: Section A; Page 18, Column 3; National Desk

LENGTH: 1627 words


As the AIDS epidemic rages in New York and California, Texas is struggling with
a less noticed but no less destructive AIDS plague of its own.

The response to AIDS in Texas has been mixed, even contradictory. In a state
that has historically ranked low in spending on social problems, much of the
burden has fallen on private groups. William W. Waybourn, president of the
Dallas Gay Alliance, calls his city, where 2,000 AIDS cases have been diagnosed
so far, ''the Calcutta of the AIDS epidemic.''

More than 8,000 cases have already been diagnosed in Texas, more than in any
state except New York, California and Florida and about the same number as in
New Jersey.

Reasons for Apparent Apathy

Yet Texas ranks among the lowest states in AIDS spending.

Some here attribute the phlegmatic response to its AIDS epidemic to the state's
conservative political bent and in part to the strength of religious
evangelicals in Texas and their often-fierce hostility to homosexuality. About
85 percent of Texans with AIDS are gay or bisexual men.

A study by the AIDS Policy Center in Washington calculated that California and
New York budgeted nearly $3 per resident for AIDS in 1989. Texas spent at a rate
of just 14 cents on state programs. Those figures do not include Federal and
local spending.

Houston, a city of nearly two million people, has recorded more than 3,000 AIDS
cases so far, ranking fourth among the nation's cities behind New York, Los
Angeles and San Francisco, according to Federal statistics reported in November.
Dallas was not far behind, in 12th place with its nearly 2,000 cases. Hundreds
more are in Austin, Fort Worth and San Antonio.

''A dark shadow is falling on Texas - we're in a very dire state,'' said the
Rev. Chris C. Steele, an Espicopalian minister in Houston. She led the State
Legislature's recent Task Force on AIDS, which called for more state spending on
AIDS treatment and prevention programs.

Better Care for Chimpanzees

In one instance Texas has even produced a curious instance of AIDS care that is
better for animals than for humans.

In San Antonio, a retirement fund of more than $1 million is being set aside for
about 40 chimpanzees infected during experiments at the Southwest Foundation for
Biomedical Research. The animals showed no ill effects, and the laboratory felt
ethically obligated to guarantee food, housing and care for the 45 years the
chimps are expected to live.

While the chimps are set for life, humans with AIDS have no matching system.
Warren W. Buckingham 3d, who directs the AIDS Arms Network in Dallas, a
coalition of private organizations, said: ''It's ironic in the extreme. They get
a hell of a lot more than we have for people with AIDS.''

Texas remains one of 24 states that outlaws homosexual intercourse. Efforts to
pass legislation protecting gay people from discrimination have failed. In
Dallas, Judge Jack Hampton was officially censured last month for saying he gave
a lighter sentence to the convicted killer of two men because the victims were
gay. In Fort Worth, the explosion of a tear gas canister abruptly ended a recent
AIDS benefit concert attended by nearly 2,000 people.

For many AIDS patients and their advocates, the paucity of medical research in
Houston, a city with a reputation for advanced cardiac care and other
sophisticated medical treatment, is particularly galling.

No Clinical Trials in Texas

No clinical trials of experimental AIDS drugs have existed for adult patients in
the state, thereby eliminating one of the few avenues to potentially helpful
treatment. This is the case even though laboratories there have received grants
for AIDS research. Only now have trials begun with DDI, or dideoxyinosine a drug
similar to AZT, or azidothymidine. AZT is the only federally approved medication
to slow the AIDS virus.

After a lawsuit prompted by the death of seven indigent patients who were
waiting for AZT at Parkland Hospital in Dallas in 1988, the drug was made more
readily available. Today about 1,700 Texans get free AZT under a program
financed jointly by the state and Federal governments.

But the program does not yet provide pentamidine, a medication that often
prevents the form of pneumonia that causes most AIDS deaths. In remote areas,
patients may have to travel 100 miles or more to clinics for such
life-prolonging therapies.

For others as well, the quality and the availability of AIDS care vary widely.
As elsewhere, those with insurance and private doctors in large cities can get
good treatment, AIDS experts say. But less fortunate patients often languish,
and this situation is aggravated in Texas by the relatively low level of social
spending.

The nation's first AIDS-only hospital, the Institute for Immunological
Disorders, opened in Houston in 1986. But because the private hospital tended to
draw poor patients who did not have their own doctors, it ran out of funds and
closed after a year.

''It was not a viable business venture, particularly in Texas, where we are
about the 48th-lowest state in Medicaid benefits,'' said R. King Hillier, the
government relations director of the Harris County Hospital District in Houston.
He said public hospitals, financed by property taxes subject to voter
referendums, are also hard-pressed to meet rising AIDS costs.

'Sad for a City This Size'

A sense of being overwhelmed pervades AIDS agencies. Omega House, a hospice in
Houston, is trying to expand from three beds to eight. The director, Karen St.
Laurent, said the need was far greater. ''We are it for indigents in Houston,
which is pretty sad for a city this size,'' she said. ''We could take care of
hundreds.''

As tenuous as AIDS care is in Texas, health officials say patients are coming
from neigboring states like Louisiana, Arkansas and Oklahoma, where there are
even fewer services.

Historically, Texas politics and religion have had a strong conservative stripe.
Adherents are often unsympathetic to AIDS needs. One legislator caused a stir
when he was quoted as saying that AIDS programs were pouring money ''down a rat
hole'' and that infected prostitutes and drug abusers should be killed.

The quest for AIDS funds has also been crimped by the state's oil bust, real
estate crash and banking collapse. In last year's session, however, the
Legislature increased AIDS allocations to a total of $18.4 million for 1989 and
1990, as against $7 million for the previous two-year period.

Yet this fell far short of the $48 million for a two-year period requested by
the Legislature's own task force led by Ms. Steele. She described a top
legislative chairman as so taken aback by the proposal that he exclaimed,
''Forty-eight million - why, that's unthinkable!''

Suits Over AIDS Abound

AIDS issues are also playing out in the courts.

A gay rights group sued a Houston music company in November after it suddenly
cut its health coverage for AIDS to $5,000 from $1 million when an employee
submitted claims. In another Houston case, neighbors are suing to stop a
proposed residence for people with AIDS.

A Texas prisoner infected with the AIDS virus, about to be paroled after serving
time for robbery, was recently resentenced to a life term after he was convicted
of attempted murder for spitting in a guard's face. And the state attorney in
September set aside a new state law requiring real estate brokers to reveal if
an apartment or house has been occupied by someone with AIDS.

The strongest response to fight AIDS in Texas has come from the grass roots. In
Dallas, the AIDS Arms Network embraces 43 private agencies and is considered a
model of cooperation.

Many efforts are undertaken by volunteers who lost friends or relatives.

When a bartender at a gay bar in San Antonio came down with AIDS, the owner,
Robert Edwards, closed the bar and turned it into an AIDS foundation, with
himself as president. Mr. Edwards, who has a long white beard and is known as
Papa Bear, said he acted because ''there was just nothing being done.''

Now the former bar is a center for counseling, testing and covert distribution
of clean needles to addicts. Next door is Casa of Care, an AIDS residence and
hospice.

Long Delays for Care

In Houston, one son of Tess Thomas died of AIDS and another has the disease. She
works for the Greater Houston AIDS Alliance, in the former Southern Pacific
Railroad Hospital. An ambulatory clinic for 800 AIDS patients opened there in
May, relieving the overcrowded public hospital where appointments are delayed up
to six hours.

Loren Allen, an energy consultant, got involved when a nephew died of AIDS
contracted from a blood transfusion.

Now on the board of the Houston AIDS Foundation, Mr. Allen is a master at
stretching scarce resources. He spotted a discarded washer and dryer for a
hospice, asked produce truckers to save leftovers, got unsold doughnuts from a
bakery, rescued a used mimeograph machine and arranged for a diaper factory to
supply AIDS babies under the care of nuns.

At Bering Memorial United Methodist Church in Houston, AIDS support groups share
space with scout troops, choir practice and Sunday school classes.

Carrying on a tradition begun in the yellow fever epidemic a century ago, the
church provides a center with free lunch, rest, socializing, entertainment and
counseling. The church converted its library into an AIDS dental clinic for
patients who had waited months for treatment at the county hospital. A bridge
for six teeth restored one man's smile and self-confidence, enabling him to get
a new job.

''To minister, a church must be sensitive to what is hurting its community,''
said the pastor, the Rev. Donald Sinclair. ''In this community, right now,
what's hurting people is AIDS.''

Because of an editing error, an article on Friday about AIDS in Texas rendered
the numbers incorrectly in a state legislator's comment on the idea of adding
$48 million to spending on AIDS programs. Apparently unable even to imagine an
increase of that size, the legislator said, ''Four to eight million - why,

DESPITE dozens of public pronouncements about the nature of AIDS and how it is
and is not transmitted, myths and fears about this fast-growing public health
menace continue to grow, accompanied at times by panic and hysteria.

While some people needlessly treat AIDS patients and carriers of the AIDS virus
as pariahs, others continue to disregard the warnings about how to prevent
further spread of the disease. With the development of a vaccine uncertain and
an effective treatment even more so, the only current hope for containing the
epidemic is to understand how the virus passes from person to person and to
adopt sensible precautions to keep yourself and others from being infected.

Based on recently accumulated information, health authorities can now offer the
most specific advice so far regarding precautions that people already infected
with the AIDS virus First of two Personal Health columns on AIDS. can take so
that they do not transmit the disease, and that the general population can take
to minimize the chances of contracting it.

AIDS occurs primarily among people in certain high-risk groups. Of the 17,000
cases diagnosed in the United States to date, more than 90 percent are from such
groups: 73 percent have been homosexual or bisexual men, 17 percent intravenous
drug users and 0.6 percent hemophiliacs who are dependent on blood clotting
Factor VIII.

Among the remaining 10 percent are recipients of blood transfusions,
heterosexual partners of AIDS carriers, emigrants from countries where AIDS is
prevalent and children born to women with AIDS. A recent study in Sweden of
patrons of an AIDS-infected prostitute has give support to the concern that the
virus may also be transmitted from women to men.

AIDS, as many health experts have repeatedly asserted, is not a very contagious
disease. It requires intimate contact, probably through the blood stream. Thus,
infected semen can spread it through intercourse in which the virus comes in
contact with broken blood vessels or lesions in the anus or vagina.
Theoretically, it could spread through deep kissing if infected saliva contacted
mouth sores or bleeding gums or through tears that land on an open wound.

How to Protect Others

AIDS can be spread not only by patients with AIDS symptoms but also by
symptom-free people who carry the virus. Once infected with the virus, people
may remain carriers for life, although they may never get sick from it. It is
assumed that people whose blood is positive for AIDS virus antibodies - a total
of perhaps one million people in the United States -harbor the live virus and
could transmit it, although future research may prove otherwise.

A person who is incubating AIDS produces more virus than someone who already has
the disease. It may take two to eight weeks before a person incubating an AIDS
infection develops antibodies in the blood, so those who know they were recently
exposed to the virus may also be contagious.

If you have AIDS or its milder form, AIDS-related complex (ARC), or if you carry
the virus, people who come into intimate contact with your blood or semen, and
possibly with other body fluids and excretions, could contract the virus. So
far, however, no cases of AIDS have been traced to exposure to infected saliva
or tears. Sweat is considered unlikely to harbor the virus because of its high
salt content. Even close ''casual'' contact with AIDS patients has not resulted
in viral transmission, as health experts have often assured the public. A study
of families of AIDS patients published this month is the best support so far for
that assertion.

No child has gotten the virus from another. Household contacts (parents and
siblings, for example) who are not sexually intimate with patients have remained
free from infection. No case of AIDS has resulted from caring for an AIDS
patient, eating foods handled by an infected person or by being coughed on or
sneezed on, casually kissing, wearing the clothes of or swimming in the same
pool as an infected person.

To prevent further spread of AIDS, these precautions are advised for everyone
known to carry the virus:

* Abstain from intimate sexual contact in which body fluids enter another
person. The use of condoms and diaphragms with contraceptive gels or foams can
greatly diminish but not eliminate the risk of transmission. Also refrain from
deep kissing. Sexual activities that do not involve the exchange of body fluids
are considered safe.

* Although the AIDS virus dies rapidly outside the body, if blood or other body
fluids are spilled, the area should be disinfected by cleansing with a solution
of one part household bleach and 10 parts water. Water temperatures of 133
degrees or higher, chemicals such as hydrogen peroxide, rubbing alcohol and
Lysol, and skin cleansers such as Betadine or Hibiclens are also effective.

* Anyone in a high risk group for AIDS, even if a screening test for AIDS
antibodies is negative, should not donate blood, plasma, semen (for artificial
insemination), organs or any other tissue. The national blood supply is now
believed to be virtually AIDS-free through the use of screening tests. Clotting
factor used by hemophiliacs is now heat-treated to eliminate the virus. There is
no risk to blood donors, since equipment is sterilized between donors, nor is
the virus spread through vaccines.

* Women who have AIDS or whose antibody test for AIDS is positive should take
precautions to avoid pregnancy and should not nurse babies. The unborn children
of women harboring the virus (even if they are symptom-free) face a 65 percent
chance of being born with AIDS, according to the March of Dimes.

* Needles pose a hazard even for people who are not drug users. Do not share
syringes, needles, rubber bulbs, ''works'' or ''cookers'' for the injection of
drugs. Do not have your ears pierced or undergo acupuncture or tattooing except
by practitioners who use sterile techniques, and do not share razors or
toothbrushes with other people.

* People whose blood tests positive for the AIDS virus should tell doctors,
dentists and eye care practitioners -and any one else who might come into
contact with their body fluids - so that proper precautions can be taken. How to
Protect Yourself If you are free of AIDS or AIDS antibodies, the United States
Public Health Service and other experts recommend these measures to prevent
infection:

* Do not have sexual contact that involves exchange of body fluids with anyone
known to have or suspected of having AIDS or who might be a carrier of the virus
or who has a positive AIDS antibody test.

* Remain sexually monogamous with a partner whom you can trust to do the same.
Never have sex with a prostitute, female or male, or with anyone who injects
drugs. Infected female prostitutes are thought to be the main possibility of
spreading the disease widely among the general heterosexual population, although
no such cases have been documented in the United States.

* Avoid anal intercourse and any sexual activity that might cause injury or
tears in body tissues.

* If you suspect that you or your sex partner may have been exposed to the AIDS
virus, use condoms in every sexual encounter and avoid oral-genital contact,
deep kissing and contact with any body fluids (semen, blood, feces, urine and
the like).

* If you are a health care practitioner, follow the precautionary guidelines
outlined by public health officials to protect yourself against hepatitis B
virus as well as AIDS. For example, dentists can wear surgical gloves and
protective eye wear. Remember, though, that no physician caring for AIDS
patients has become AIDS-positive as a result of this exposure. Indeed, only two
people out of hundreds of medical personnel who have been accidentally pricked
by needles used on AIDS patients have themselves become infected.

Poor deprived of legal aid under existing law

LENGTH: 547 words

DATELINE: Dhaka


Dhaka, Dec. 31 -- The poor are not getting legal aid properly from the 'National
Legal Aid Services Organization' under the existing law.

Supreme Court Legal Aid Committee (SCLAC) have already discussed about the
limitation of the legal aid law in a recent meeting.

They have also sent a letter to the National Legal Aid Services Organization to
bring some amendments to the law in this regard.

Those people who earn Tk One and a half lakh or less annually can get legal
assistance from the Suprme Court Legal Aid Office. This limit is one lakh at
district level courts.

Children, ethnic minorities, phisically disabled, victims of trafficking, widows
and old age allowance receivers are also considered for this aid.

Supreme Court Legal Aid Office gives aid to the poor for criminal appeal and
revision, civil appeal and revision, jail appeal, writ petition and leave to
appeal. But there is no opportunity to get legal aid for bail petition. That is
why the poor are failing to

seek bail in the Supreme Court (SC) who have been in jail for a long time
without trial.

Many people have been harassed in false cases. But they are not getting any aid
from the Legal Aid Office to file a application in the SC seeking cancellation
of the case.

Even the Legal Aid Office does not help file an application to stay any case in
the lower court filed with an false allegation. In addition, there is no scope
in the Legal Aid Law to file an application in the High Court against lower
court verdict.

Sources said that most people face the bail related problems in the courts. Many
people cannot get bail for financial crisis though they have been in jail for a
long time without any trial in false cases. So the officials have demanded
reforms of the Legal Aid Law.

Recently the Supreme Court Legal Aid Committee in a meeting discussed about the
limitation of the Legal Aid Law. Later, they also sent a letter to the National
Legal Aid Services Organization to bring some amendments in this regard.

They also suggested that income level of aid receivers should be income tax
level or less than that from Tk One and a half lakh. The committee also
requested the National Legal Aid Services Organization to reconsider the fees of
the panel lawyers of the High Court and the Appellate Division and the Advocates
on record of the Appellate Division.

Coordinator of the Supreme Court Legal Aid Office Ripon Paul Sku admitted, the
Law has some limitations. That is why they couldn't help the poor in some cases.

He said that the Supreme Court Legal Aid Office is unable to give help to anyone
to seek bail in the High Court if the bail petition is rejected in the lower
court. Even they are unable to provide any assistance in case of anticipatory
bail.

Sources said that the Legal Aid Offices have been established in 64 districts of
the country to give legal aid to the poor and the helpless people. 'Manusher
Janno Foundation', a private organization, is working as a associate
organization for legal aid. Subsequently Supreme Court Legal Aid Office is
giving legal assistance in the Supreme Court to the poor.

Foreign aid as a tool for development;
Tories initially disdained aid policy, but now link international funds to
mining and private-sector investment

BYLINE: CAMPBELL CLARK

SECTION: COLUMN; INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS; Pg. A8

LENGTH: 737 words


cclark@globeandmail.com

The Conservative revolution in Canada's foreign aid is finally here.

It's not just that the Harper government has folded the former aid agency, CIDA,
into the Foreign Affairs department, ending the flimsy pretense of separation
between politics and aid policy. It's that the money spent by Canada on aid now
reflects the Tories' view of the world, or at least the aid world.

For years the Tories have talked about changing Canadian aid, and NGOs and aid
advocates have expressed fears about what they planned. But some of the Tories'
ideas about aid were ad-hoc notions, and it's taken time for little shifts to
really change the aid portfolio - a big, lumbering thing made up of thousands of
multiyear projects. Now it has.

There's a stronger belief in development banks, aid projects built around
Canadian commercial interests in mining, and a profound faith in the power of
the private sector.

The projects funded this year, especially, show an unmistakable Tory stamp. The
Conservatives, controversially, have since last year been touting the idea of
linking aid to the mining industry, and they had already financed a few small
projects to test the waters. But the money is rolling out more this year.

Among other things: $25-million for an institute on mining and development based
at the University of British Columbia; $16-million to improve environmental
practices of Peru's mining sector, and $17.4-million to "promote economic
competitiveness" in mining regions - to help build the businesses of small rural
farmers in three areas of Peru where Canadian companies operate mines.

Beyond mining, this year's projects reflect the Harper government's inclination
to back development through the private sector and "entrepreneurship." There's
$20-million to the International Finance Corporation to back private-sector
development, $700,000 to improve entrepreneurship in Mozambique, and $20-million
to the Mennonite Economic Development Associates of Canada to back an investment
fund for small business in developing countries.

It's not just mining and the private sector. Much of the portfolio - setting
aside the emergency aid for humanitarian appeals - now reflects the little
shifts the Tories have made in aid policy.

There's a lot of food aid, and consistent backing for development banks. And
there are the ongoing funds for the maternal-health initiative that Mr. Harper
championed when he hosted the G8 - the one time he really attached his political
identity to aid.

The Conservatives came into power with little affinity for development aid, and
never made it a top priority. When deficits had to be slain, the aid budget was
first frozen, then cut. They decided they didn't want to pay budgets for aid
agencies doing "advocacy," which was seen as an effort to silence them because
the advocacy was often for left-leaning causes. Mr. Harper didn't follow the
Liberal enthusiasm for increasing aid to Africa because he associated it with
"slush funds and Swiss bank accounts," a former aide said.

But they did other things, too. Because they doubted whether many of the aid
projects under rubrics like "governance" were really worth it, they reached for
concrete, simple items - and became big backers of food aid. When the financial
crisis of 2008 and the Arab Spring of 2011 came along, Mr. Harper touted
Ottawa's increased backing of multilateral development banks as Canada's aid
response. A PM who doubted the effectiveness of aid grants believed the banks'
lending was often more efficient.

Now the Conservatives' linking of aid to mining, and focusing more development
around the private sector, makes up a major part of Canadian aid. They argue
backing the private sector is key to developing economies, and supporting
development in mining areas can help local communities and Canadian interests.

"It's a sea change. It's dramatic," said John McKay, a Liberal MP who in 2007
sponsored the Better Aid Bill, which makes "poverty alleviation" the official
goal of Canadian aid.

He insists the Conservatives have made Canadian aid a political animal, linked
to Canada's commercial interests in mining and free-market ideology, rather than
helping the poorest of the poor.

But the Conservatives, who came to power distrusting Canadian aid, have taken
the sum of their little shifts and designed a different model for Canadian aid.
And it's only now fully in place.

Proceeds from the annual Red Tie Night galas benefit the sponsoring Oklahoma
AIDS Care Fund and the 2005 party once again topped the previous year's
proceeds.

Barbara Cooper, founding chairman of the fund, announced that $503,500 has been
distributed in grants to 16 agencies. She and her husband, Jackie, founded the
Oklahoma AIDS Care Fund and inaugurated the Red Tie Night benefits after they
lost a son to AIDS.

The agencies which are receiving financial assistance from OACF and their
programs include:

* The AIDS Support Program for The Winds House, a housing project for people
living with AIDS.

l American Red Cross, Oklahoma County Chapter, for an HIV/AIDS education
coordinator and materials geared to Hispanic, African and Native Americans.

Penguin parade

The March of the Emperor Penguins now showing at local theaters is a film not to
be missed. The black and white birds, who can swim like fish, live in the
coldest region of the world, Antarctica, in temperatures which are around 56
degrees below zero in the summer and at least 60 degrees below in the winter
when the sun never shines. Actor Morgan Freeman does a magnificent job of the
commentary for the French documentary. The scenery - all ice and snow - is
spectacular. But it's the birds that make you hold your breath.

Each year, for centuries, it seems, the penguins spend the summer near water and
then move 70 or so miles to another region of Antarctica to breed and raise
their young. When they reach their traditional breeding place, they pair up,
breed and produce eggs.

The show makes the Emperor Penguins look quite large but the closing shows them
with the human photographers and one realizes they're really fairly small, maybe
three feet tall at the most.

Kool-Aid still king of the soft drinks

SOURCE: New York Daily News

BYLINE: Sallie Han

SECTION: FOOD;LIFE; Pg. B5

LENGTH: 802 words


Come summertime, Kool-Aid is king, simple as that. Or as the Kool-Aid Man, the
product's famous pitch (or pitcher) man would put it: 'Oh yeah!'

During the months of June, July and August, summer's true colours are revealed
to be watermelon-cherry red, white and raspberry lemonade ice blue.

Thirst quenching? Oh yeah!

Refreshing? Oh yeah!

Take a moment to reflect over a glass, and you will find the virtues of Kool-Aid
are many and the social significance of this soft drink is great.

Oh yeah!

The World Wide Web is awash in personal Web pages proffering paeans to Tropical
Punch or Slammin' Strawberry-Kiwi -- not to mention an entire UseNet group
(alt.drink.kool-aid) devoted to discussion of Kool-Aid's peculiar charms.

Kool-Aid is multifunctional as the Internet reveals. Have a look and you will
find recipes for Kool-Aid cookies and Kool-Aid Rice Krispies squares, tips on
how to remove Kool-Aid stains from fabrics and faces (baking soda in either
case), even suggested industrial applications of Kool-Aid, such as dyeing wool
or cleaning fish tanks.

Paul Dawson-Schmidt, the king of the Kool-Aid UseNet group, confesses to a
lifelong fascination with the soft drink. (His favourite flavours are
Sharkleberry Fin and Kickin' Kiwi Lime.)

"It's much more interesting than pop as far as flavours go," Dawson-Schmidt
explains. "It is part of growing up and it stays with you."

Think about it: Kool-Aid is always fresh. The flavour crystals never go bad or
stale as long as you keep the packets dry. And Kool-Aid's flavours, like the
times, are always a-changin'. A list of current flavours is posted at www.kool-
aid.com.

Kool-Aid is always relevant because it can change with you, your tastes and your
lifestyle.

Yesterday, you liked Grape but today, you prefer Blastin' Berry Cherry.

Yesterday, you charged 50 cents a cup at the Kool-Aid stand you set up in front
of your parents' house. Today, you are using it to dye your hair purple, blue or
green. (Three different methods are recommended on the UseNet group.)

In fact, Kool-Aid is everyday proof that change is good -- and that it is
possible.

The drink powder may not turn gray skies to blue, but it can perform another
kind of miracle: transforming two quarts of plain tap water into a boldly
coloured and brightly flavoured beverage.

The truth is, Kool-Aid is always on the edge. It gained some counterculture
notoriety when, in 1966, Ken Kesey and his band of Merry Pranksters spiked a
batch with LSD and gave it away in paper cups. That prank came to be known as
the Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test, also the title of Tom Wolfe's book recounting
the event.

For Stephen Spady, great-nephew of the drink's inventor, Kool-Aid has a
patriotic appeal.

"In a way, Kool-Aid is the American dream," he says.

In the wee years of the 20th century, an 11-year-old boy named Edwin Perkins
invented and sold through the mail a drink syrup he called Fruit Smack.

But the glass bottles sometimes broke during shipping or their cork stoppers
dried out. In 1927, Perkins developed a drink powder and started selling it.
Because it was (and still is) affordable to everyone, Kool-Aid succeeded despite
the Great Depression.

Jell-O powder was the inspiration for Kool-Aid, according to Spady, who is
himself an inventor (he develops software for Microsoft).

ON THE MAP

Originally, the product was called Kool-Ade and then Kool-Aid because government
regulations required that any drink with the suffix "ade" contain real fruit
juices -- "which Kool-Aid obviously does not," Spady adds.

Kool-Aid contains no fruit juices or fat. Its ingredients include sugar,
artificial flavour and colour and some Vitamin C.

For the folks of Hastings, Neb. (population 22,000), Kool-Aid in and of itself
is cause enough for a celebration. Hastings is where Kool-Aid was invented 71
years ago; thus they require no other reason.

GIANT KOOL-AID STAND

Next Sunday, they are celebrating the soft drink that put their town on the map
by setting up what event co-chair Todd Kirshenbaum claims will be the world's
biggest Kool-Aid stand along Interstate 80, the most heavily travelled east-west
route in the U.S.

A dozen different flavours of Kool-Aid (including perennial favorites like Black
Cherry and Lemonade) will be served free with the purchase of a commemorative
souvenir mug.

"It is kind of dorky," Kirshenbaum acknowledges. "But it is a quirky product,
and I think that is why people like it."

After all, Kool-Aid is and always was about good times and fun. Contrary to
popular belief, Kool-Aid had no part in the mass suicide at Jonestown: According
to Dawson-Schmidt of the Kool-Aid UseNet group, cult leader Jim Jones and his
followers drank grape-flavoured Flavour-Aid.

"It's the more generic brand," he claims, "and not as good."

AIDS patients wait for Ottawa to move on AZT

BYLINE: By Jennifer Gould Toronto Star

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A16

LENGTH: 383 words


   Ottawa should allow AIDS patients earlier access to AZT treatment now that a
U.S. study has shown it can curb or even neutralize the onset of the disease,
says an AIDS patient in Metro.

"Before, you had to wait to get sick before you were given the drug. Now people
will be encouraged to test for the disease sooner and take the drug to prevent
getting sick," said Wilf Galdosch.

Galdosch, 28, is an AIDS support councillor with the AIDS Committee of Toronto.

He has been tested HIV positive. HIV - human immunodeficiency virus - is what
causes AIDS.

U.S. study

The U.S. study, released Thursday, showed that AZT - azidothymidine - can help
treat people who have tested positive for the AIDS virus but who aren't showing
any symptoms.

AZT is now only available to AIDS patients in Ontario whose blood count has
dropped to a high risk level.

"It wasn't a great way to deal with AIDS," Galdosch said. "It didn't seem to
make sense to have to get sick before you could get treated."

Ottawa is still reviewing the U.S. study. However, last week U.S. health
officials said that the estimated 650,000 Americans who have the AIDS virus but
show no symptoms should begin taking AZT as soon as possible.

Ottawa should give people who have the AIDS virus the option of taking AZT, when
and if they want to, said Mariam Mayhew, executive director of Casey House,
which provides support and shelter to AIDS patients in Metro.

"The evidence suggests that the drug is potentially helpful, and I think people
with AIDS should be allowed access to it," she said. "However, ethical research
must go on.

Positive drug

"AIDS activists see this drug as positive, because they have nothing to lose,
and I'm very sympathetic to this. The debate is whether or not the research is
adequate enough to justify the cost of the drug and its potential risks," she
said.

"We don't have enough to go on," said Lesli Gaynor, a councillor with the AIDS
Committee of Toronto. "This could be a very promising change, but the big
question is the toxicity of the drug."

Studies have shown that taking AZT for a long time may produce harmful side
effects that remain unknown.

Still, Gaynor wants to see the drug available as soon as possible, leaving the
choice up to the individual patients.

LIBERALS WOULD GIVE DOCTORS AIDS CHOICE

SOURCE: QNP

BYLINE: QUINN S

LENGTH: 303 words


Liberals would give doctors AIDS choice From SUE QUINN in Canberra DOCTORS would
be allowed to refuse to treat AIDS patients under a coalition Government. The
Federal Opposition AIDS policy released yesterday would enable doctors to refuse
to treat AIDS patients and have them referred to AIDS specialists, without the
doctor being sued. The Opposition health spokesman, Mr Shack, ruled out mass
testing of the community, including hospital patients, but endorsed the right of
health care workers to know the AIDS status of patients. He said if patients
refused an AIDS test, doctors would have the right to consider them potential
AIDS carriers and be ""indemnified from any legal action in the exercise of
their medical judgment". But the policy calls for the compuslory testing of
defence force personnel, prisoners and intending migrants . Mr Shack said it was
essential that military health care workers knew the AIDS status of personnel.
He said a coalition Government would: Reserve the right to carry out selected
anonymous screening for AIDS. Implement contact tracing to identify and offer
counselling to people who might be at risk of catching AIDS. Support
anti-discrimination measures to protect AIDS carriers and health care workers.
Provide financial support for voluntary testing of people in high-risk groups.
Investigate ways to allow AIDS patients to import or obtain alternative drugs
and ensure access to the latest effective drugs and counselling services.
Provide financial assistance where necessary to AIDS carriers and promote work
practices to allow them to remain in employment. Overhaul AIDS advisory bodies
and AIDS programs. Not support legalisation or decriminalisation of heroin or
other narcotics but would support needle exchange programs and the availability
of condoms.

What Some Washingtonians Don't Know About AIDS

SECTION: EDITORIAL; PAGE B8; CLOSE TO HOME

LENGTH: 643 words


As of July 11, according to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, there
have been more than 67,000 cases of AIDS among adults reported nationwide.
Almost 38,000 of these people have died. There have been more than 1,200
reported cases of AIDS in the District of Columbia and more than 740 deaths.

AIDS victims are disproportionately black. While blacks make up 12 percent of
the population of the United States, 25 percent of all people with AIDS are
black. Furthermore, one out of every two women and six out of every 10 children
who have AIDS in the United States are black.

In an attempt to better understand people's attitudes toward AIDS, we
interviewed by telephone 489 respondents over the age of 18 living in
Washington. The survey was conducted in the winter of 1987.

The majority of Washington residents know that the primary mechanism by which
AIDS is spread is intimate sexual contact (86 percent) and that the primary
mechanism to prevent AIDS is the use of condoms with new partners (85 percent).

However, few residents identified the sharing of needles (39 percent) or blood
transfusions (33 percent) as primary mechanisms for spreading AIDS. Concern is
especially warranted given the fact that respondents without college degrees
(i.e., those who are most likely to use hypodermic needles) were less able than
other respondents to identify the sharing of needles as a source of transmitting
AIDS.

In addition, a significant number of respondents have incorrect conceptions of
how AIDS is spread (toilets -- 16 percent, drinking glasses -- 28 percent,
etc.). This is worrisome, because holding incorrect beliefs about the spread of
AIDS leads, in part, to support for repressive public policies on AIDS and its
victims.

Many respondents, in fact, did support repressive policies. These include
quarantine (27 percent), employment discrimination (20 percent) and the passing
of antihomosexual legislation (25 percent). As AIDS continues to spread to the
heterosexual community, support for these and other similar policies is likely
to grow.

People who have the most personal concern about AIDS are also more likely to
have incorrect knowledge about AIDS and are also more likely to support
repressive policies. This suggests that there is a need for intense education to
inform people about how AIDS is not spread. Presumably such activities would
lessen fear and lead to less support for repressive public policies on AIDS and
AIDS victims.

Black respondents were found to have less knowledge about AIDS and to be more
likely to support repressive policies than white respondents. (Many of the
differences between the two races' attitudes on AIDS disappeared after
controlling for differences in education.) This suggests that education in the
black community has not been successful and that a concerted effort to increase
educational outreach in that community is still needed.

The media have an important role to play in AIDS education campaigns.
Respondents who frequently watched the television news, we found, were the most
likely to believe that one could get AIDS from eating food and donating blood
and supported repressive statements on AIDS victims. Journalists need to take
much more care in writing AIDS stories.

Educational programs by themselves will probably not be sufficient to slow the
spread of AIDS. Education must be combined with individual and group counseling,
as well as widespread efforts to make prevention items (condoms, clean needles,
methadone maintenance programs, drug counseling, etc.) readily available at
nominal cost or free to the populace. Unfounded hysteria about casual contact
with AIDS victims can only be fought by increased education combined with
leadership from the community.  -- Richard Seltzer, Aisha Gilliam and Carolyn
Stroman are professors at Howard University.

Penny-Wise, Pork Foolish;
Poor Nations Need Real Development Help, Not Pet Projects

BYLINE: John Maxwell Hamilton, John H. Sullivan

SECTION: OUTLOOK; PAGE D5; INSIGHT

LENGTH: 1250 words


IN RECENT years, Republican Sen. Mark O. Hatfield won congressional approval for
a foreign-aid appropriation to send 2.5 million poplars from his native Oregon
to Nepal. Ron Paul (R-Tex.) called for an immediate cutoff of aid to the
Philippines because some of its citizens eat dogs. And the Democratic-controlled
House voted to stop aid to countries that do not provide adequate airport
security.

It is time for advocates of U.S. foreign-assistance programs to face the facts:
Foreign aid, a bright vision for promoting a world that might be, is stretched
too thin and loaded down with meaningless ornaments. It is also pitifully small.

Getting aid through Congress has become a service to the military establishment,
which wants to sell armaments overseas, and to narrow special interests.

The arguments considered necessary to secure passage have become part of the
problem, contributing to public confusion about the value of foreign aid.

Under these circumstances those who care about foreign aid have good reason to
explore ways of rebuilding the program from the ground up.

Contrary to public perception, developmental aid -- assistance designed to
foster economic growth -- accounts for a small share of the federal budget, less
than one cent out of every dollar. In real terms development assistance has
declined by more than one-half since 1961, when the Agency for International
Development (AID) was created.

Aid efforts now are on a par with U.S. government contributions abroad before
any foreign aid program ever existed. Our quick survey shows that in 1919 United
States non-military assistance amounted to at least 0.33 percent of the gross
national product (GNP).

Today non-military economic assistance equals only 0.24 percent of the GNP. That
puts the United States dead last among the industrialized countries in aid
-giving.

The growth in foreign aid has come in military aid and in economic support or
security assistance -- guns on the one hand and money paid to secure base rights
in the Philippines or support key allies like Israel on the other -- but not in
development assistance. Military aid jumped 81 percent between 1981 and 1986;
security assistance increased 66 percent. Together military and security
assistance now command two-thirds of the total $ 14-billion aid program.

Winning support for any program requires political give and take. That is part
of our process and can be healthy. But a point can be reached when horse trading
compromises the final objective and obscures priorities. Tying foreign aid to
Filipino culinary habits is one part of the problem. But even relevant ideas can
become albatrosses when they are hung indiscriminately on the foreign-aid
program.

The current foreign-aid statute lists at least 33 separate objectives, ranging
from promoting cooperatives to protecting endangered species.

Rather than spread the program over a large canvas in hopes of winning support
from special interests, we need to broaden the constituency. Americans have good
reasons to support foreign aid, if only leaders will present them.

The case for modern assistance programs has rested largely on security and
political-stability concerns -- or, more to the point, anti-communism. Although
serious leaders may argue that this is a useful goal, practically it is
unreachable through aid and sows the seeds of public disillusionment with aid
programs.

Dynamic aid programs seeking to create resilient societies must promote change,
not stability. Moreover, if aid helps countries become strong enough to resist
the blandishments of communists, then it must also create countries that can
resist the blandishments of the United States.

The success of aid should not be measured by whether countries vote with us in
the United Nations. The true measure of success should be whether countries
develop economically. Using aid for other purposes makes as much sense as eating
soup with a fork.

The humanitarian argument for aid, also a traditional rationale, is valid but,
as experience has shown, of limited utility. Moreover, it misses the point. We
cannot consider aid simply as a nice thing to do. It has become an imperative
thing to do.

Aid, properly applied, is in our self-interest.

In our interdependent world, the economic problems of developing countries are
our problems. The inability of poor countries to fight disease and protect their
environments has an impact on our own health and environment. As a result of
Third World desertification, we lose forever unique genetic material -- strains
of wheat and other grains, for example -- needed to produce higher-yielding crop
varieties in the United States.

Meanwhile, poor Bolivian farmers growing coca to feed their families cultivate
our drug problem. Hunger drives illegal immigrants into this country. And lack
of buying power and productive capacity in developing countries mean decreased
export possibilities for us and fewer jobs.

This is not to say, as aid advocates often do, that Third World growth is always
in our interest. Growth overseas creates global competitors, too.

But we cannot protect ourselves by ignoring developing countries. The way to
protect ourselves is to foster long-term relations and a stake in their
prosperity. Countries with solid development strategies can buy imports and that
cam help U.S. factories.

The key is to distinguish between long- and short-range interests.

A perennial argument advanced for aid is that 80 cents out of every dollar is
spent in the United States. That is disingenous. Those who believe in aid do not
do so for that reason. More to the point, if aid is good because some of the
money is spent in the United States, it is better if all of it is spent here on
strictly domestic projects.

Parochial arguments for aid promote selfishness rather than a broader sense of
our common interests. They also devalue aid programs in the eyes of the
recipients.

Once we see that aid is in our interest, we can stop plastering AID logos on
schools, dams and other projects funded overseas. The habit is as offensive as
putting our own initials on the Christmas presents we give away each year.
Realizing that aid is in the interest of recipient and donor alike, we can stop
thinking of it as a temporary expedient and recognize that there will always be
some other country or people whose conditions can be improved.

At the same time we can consider arrangements to make aid truly collaborative.
One dramatic change in the last 25 years is the emergence of indigenous
development institutions overseas capable of using resources effectively without
detailed American direction. We must learn to help these organizations do the
job of development.

"The folly of foreign aid since 1946," Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) said on the
Senate floor several years back, "is an alarming symptom of what is wrong with
the federal government -- and the country."

Helms, certainly no supporter of foreign aid, had a point, if for all the wrong
reasons. Until the government and the people put aid in a new perspective, not
as a parochial interest but as a true national interest, it will limp along
neither doing as well as it can nor as well as it should.

The story so far ... #13 Legal Aid

BYLINE: Paul Conroy

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 4

LENGTH: 1433 words


The human cost of legal aid cuts has deeply afflicted Australia's underclass of
defendants who cannot afford a private lawyer or qualify for legal assistance.
They now face the prospect of being denied justice in court.

In 1996, the legal profession protested to the federal Attorney-General, Mr
Daryl Williams, about changes to the funding formula for legal aid, governed by
a financial agreement with the states and the Commonwealth.

The then president of the Law Institute of Victoria, Mr James Syme, signalled
that 200 fewer people would have access to legal aid each year due to the cuts.
It appears that Mr Syme's prediction may have been understated.

Legal aid bodies across the country have since introduced draconian legal aid
guidelines, with Victoria Legal Aid among the toughest. It has never been easy
to get legal aid but it has become even more difficult. And even if funding is
granted, the money can run out during a hearing.

As a result, defendants who cannot afford a private lawyer are pleading guilty
to serious charges because they feel they cannot legally defend themselves.

The consequences of the cuts were apparent in a survey by the Federation of
Community Legal Centres released in late 1996. It found that women who had been
battered and sexually assaulted were being forced to represent themselves in the
Family Court. They were also being cross-examined by their former partners in
court.

Eroded is the safety net that once provided legal assistance to women,
immigrants, the mentally ill and those on benefits. But without a healthy legal
aid system, such applicants for legal aid are likely to become even more
marginalised. And as judges and lawyers have predicted, the result will be
travesties of justice.

A matter of justice

The Law Handbook published by the Fitzroy Legal Service describes legal aid as
the services available for people who are unable to afford the cost of the
services they need to resolve legal problems. Legal aid services include advice,
information, legal education, representation and negotiation. Legal assistance
in Victoria refers to the allocation of funds by Victoria Legal Aid (VLA) for a
lawyer to act for a person who requires legal work to be done on their behalf.

* 1973:

The Whitlam Government establishes the Australian Legal Aid Office providing
assistance to people whom the Commonwealth of Australia has a responsibility to
under the Australian Constitution and in matters arising under federal law such
as the Family

Law Act and the Matrimonial Causes Act.

* April 1978:

The federal Attorney-General, Senator Peter Durack, appoints members to the
Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission who will research financing and provision of
legal assistance.

* November 1979:

The federal Attorney-General releases a statement saying that the Commonwealth
Legal Aid Commission has failed to appreciate the need for restraint in the
expenditure of public money.

* September 1981:

The Legal Aid Commission of Victoria is established.

* June 1982:

Parents who have to travel within Australia to enforce custody orders can now
apply to the Commonwealth Legal Aid Service for travelling costs.

* November 1982:

In its first annual report the Victorian commission says its low budget has
forced staff to introduce new eligibility rules that exclude a large proportion
of Victorian residents unless in exceptional hardship or an emergency.

* November 1983:

New rules regulate the income that Family Court lawyers may earn for legal aid
work. The federal Attorney-General, Senator Gareth Evans, says they are to
restrain spiralling costs.

* December 1986:

The Federal Government sets up the National Legal Aid Representative Council and
the National Legal Aid Advisory Committee to report directly to the federal
Attorney-General. The bodies establish a new national administrative and
advisory structure to "administer, coordinate and provide advice on matters
involving legal aid".

* July 1990:

A report issued by the National Legal Aid Advisory Committee concludes that
funding is inadequate and the needs of the Australian community were not being
satisfied by the programs available at the end of the 1980s.

* October 1991:

The Victorian Legal Aid Commission's annual report shows that the commission is
rejecting one in three applications for assistance. Rises in inflation, the
recession and an increase in solicitors' fees had caused a funding shortfall.

* November 1992:

The Victorian Government cuts $2.3 million from the Legal Aid Commission. The
commission announces a $50,000 cap on legal aid in criminal or civil cases. The
capping results in the adjournment of two trials.

* April 1993:

The Victorian Government introduces legislation that exempts the state from a
1992 High Court ruling linking the right to a fair trial with the right to legal
representation. The new legislation allows judges to order the Legal Aid
Commission to fund cases it would otherwise reject. This stops cases being
adjourned but causes a greater strain on the legal aid coffers.

* November 1993:

The Victorian Auditor-General, Mr Ches Baragwanath, advises the Government to
deregulate the legal profession and reduce lawyers' fees to improve access to
legal aid.

* May 1994:

The Victorian Attorney-General, Mrs Jan Wade, announces

$1 million for Lawcare, a new legal aid fund for civil cases to supplement the
present system. Lawyers to represent clients on the basis that they will not be

Victoria Legal Aid's managing director, Mr Rob Cornall, announces legal aid will
not be granted unless there is the likelihood that a defendant will be jailed,
or will receive a suspended sentence. Legal aid will also be denied unless there
is a prospect of a fine of $1000 or more.

* August:

Federal Budget cuts $33 million in legal aid. The federal Attorney-General, Mr
Daryl Williams, later states that an outdated and inefficient legal aid system
is providing Rolls-Royce representation for a few and needs to be reformed.

* 1997 March:

About 500 people rally outside the Victorian Supreme Court as part of the
national day of action to protest against the cuts.

* May:

Legal aid review committees, comprising representatives of community and legal
groups, to be replaced by "independent reviewers" to be appointed directly by
Mrs Wade.

* June:

Mrs Wade announces that after the next financial year when the joint funding
arrangement ends (under which the Federal Government pays 55 per cent of
Victoria Legal Aid's spending and Victoria 45 per cent), the Commonwealth will
provide money only for federal cases, mostly Family Court matters.

* October:

According to a draft proposal by Victoria Legal Aid strict performance standards
will apply to those lawyers who want to be listed on panels. Victorian lawyers
are concerned they will be unable to criticise drastic changes in the system if
they want to be eligible for work.

In his annual report to Parliament, the Chief Justice of the Family Court,
Justice Alastair Nicholson, says the continuing dispute over funding cuts has
seriously affected the operation of the court and the wellbeing of clients,
including children.

* 1998 February:

A Constitutional Reference Committee into the Australian Legal Aid System begins
hearings in Melbourne.

A test case in the High Court is expected to decide whether the Family Court can
order a statutory body, such as Victoria Legal Aid, to pay for a child to have
an independent lawyer. The case, which has gone on for more than eight years,
involves an access battle between parents and grandparents of a child. Under the
legal aid guidelines put in place in 1996, payment for a separate child
representative was means tested and capped at $15,000. Justice John Faulks
ordered Victoria Legal Aid to pay an extra $9037 for future costs of the girl's
legal representatives. Victoria Legal Aid appealed to the High Court on the
basis that the Family Court has no jurisdiction over the statutory body.

* March:

Victoria's legal aid budget cut by $2.9 million after the State Government
strikes a deal with the Commonwealth to avoid a proposed $9 million cut.

* April:

Mr Rob Cornall says Victoria Legal Aid needs an extra $4.7 million in funding by
1999.

* June:

The acting Chief Justice of the Family Court, Justice Alan Barblett, says the
legal aid funding cuts have created huge problems in divorces. Lawyers were
abandoning clients halfway through cases when Victoria Legal Aid's $10,000 fee
cap for a spouse ran out. Spouses were then representing themselves.

Hodeida struggles to fight AIDS

LENGTH: 890 words


AIDS sufferers in the impoverished Hodeida governorate used to be stereotyped as
indecent people. But this unjust view is changing.

In the last few years, volunteers, organizations and different initiatives have
contributed greatly towards changing stereotypes by providing locals with vital
information about the prevention of AIDS.



Hodeida has been suffering from a spread of HIV/AIDS among its people. The
number of people living with AIDS has passed 300 and is rising, according to the
Abu Mosa Al-Ashari Association, an NGO focusing on AIDS in Hodeida.

At the same time, AIDS experts and activists say that there are many unannounced
cases, with most exposed cases being discovered by accident.

Faisal Al-Ghoshaimi, a youth activist and program coordinator at Al-Islah
Charitable Association in Hodeida, said that there were no accurate statistics
on the number of people living with HIV/AIDS in the area.

"Most of Hodeida`s locals have no information about AIDS or how it is
transmitted - even educated people do not understand the AIDS virus," he said.
"People here insult AIDS sufferers and treat them very badly. They think that
AIDS infections are caused only by sexual intercourse."

Al-Ghushaimi leads more than 200 male and female volunteers who are dedicated to
raising awareness about the prevention of HIV/AIDS among youths and children.

They have visited many areas, including rural areas, to heighten awareness about
the virus.

"We faced many difficulties in the beginning of our awareness campaign but we
convinced many people of the importance of this issue," he explained.

He indicated that because Hodeida is a meeting place for many people from
different governorates "this helps the spread of the AIDS virus."

Workers as AIDS messengers

Last month, the Abu Mosa Al-Ashari Association in Hodeida held a workshop about
AIDS and the protection of sufferer's rights. The association targeted decision
makers in Hodeida and representatives of private sectors, the national council,
media people and NGOs with the aim of raising awareness of the virus.

The workshop also aimed to reinforce existing laws that are designed to protect
the rights of AIDS sufferers but are rarely implemented, in a bid to boost
morale among victims and give them an opportunity to integrate with their
society.

Fekry Al-Qadasi, project coordinator at the association told the Yemen Times
that most of people living with AIDS struggle in a severe economic situation.


Speaking about the workshop, he said: "We chose one worker from factories,
companies, banks and public agencies to give them vital information about AIDS
and we urged them to convey this information to their colleagues.

"Now we have a messenger in many factories and companies."

Remembering the tragic story of one patient, Al-Qadasi said: "One of the AIDS
sufferers was treated badly by his neighbors and his sheikh because they
discovered that he had the AIDS virus. His only piece of land was stolen by his
sheikh and his electricity was cut off by his neighbors."

Misconception of AIDS

Me For My Country is one of the organizations that have worked effectively in
the field of HIV/AIDS awareness.

This year, the organization provided Hodeida locals with a voluntary testing
service to make sure that people don't have the virus and free advice if they do
test positive.

The organization also held two art exhibitions to highlight the AIDS issue in
Hodeida. The first featured paintings by children, followed by an exhibition by
professional artists.

Speaking to the Yemen Times, Shawqiya Al-Absi, head of Me For My Country said
that Yemeni society deals with the AIDS problem as an indecent issue.

However, she explained that societies in Hodeida have started accepting the
issue. "Volunteers and different organizations in Hodeida have made concerted
efforts to convince people about the significance of this issue," she said.

"Hodeida's locals used to be afraid of this issue. They were worried about being
tested to see whether they had the HIV virus or not," added Al-Absi.

There is a mistaken belief among Yemenis that AIDS is caused only by
intercourse, she explained. "Unfortunately, AIDS victims in Yemen are
stereotyped as immoral."

Al-Absi pointed out that the free advice offered about the danger of AIDS has
led many people to get tested.

According to Al-Absi, Illiteracy, poverty, malnutrition and a lack of child
protection have contributed to the spread of AIDS in the governorate.

But she praised the youths and volunteers who have made noticeable efforts to
educate Hodeida's teenagers and locals about the virus.

As Al-Absi said, in recent years,people in Hodeida have become increasingly
aware of AIDS. "Many people now have knowledge about the prevention of AIDS.
They are now keen to get further information about it," she said optimistically.


Al-Absi stressed the importance of raising awareness of AIDS among people in the
rural areas. She said that there are many AIDS victims there due to unprotected
sex.

"People from these areas have no any information about AIDS. Some of these areas
have special tents that used as brothels," she explained.

But Al-Absi feels confident of the ability of youths and volunteers in Hodeida
to limit the spread of the virus.

"We will do our best to fight AIDS in Hodeida," she said enthusiastically.

Pakistan: World Aids Day on Wednesday

LENGTH: 574  words

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD


ISLAMABAD, Nov. 30 -- The World Aids day to be celebrated

on 1st December over the world including Pakistan with the aim to

elevate the awareness of AIDS pandemic sources by spreading of HIV

infectivity.

World AIDS Day on 1 December draws together people from around

the world to raise awareness about HIV/AIDS and demonstrate

international solidarity in the face of the pandemic.

The Day is one of the most visible opportunities for public

and private partners to spread awareness about the status of the

pandemic and encourage progress in HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment

and care in high prevalence countries and around the world.

There are now 33.4 million people living with HIV, according

to 2008 figures released by WHO. An estimated 2.7 million were newly

infected with the virus and 2 million died of AIDS the same year.

Sub-Saharan Africa remains the region most heavily affected by HIV.

In 2008, sub-Saharan Africa accounted for 67% of HIV

infections worldwide, 68% of new HIV infections among adults and 91%

of new HIV infections among children.

The region also accounted for 72% of the world's AIDS-related

deaths in 2008.

The World AIDS Day was primary conceived in August 1987 by

Thomas Netter and James W. Bunn, both are information officers for

Global Program on AIDS at World Health Organization in Geneva,

Switzerland.

Netter and Bunn took their scheme to Dr. Jonathan Mann,

Director of Global Program on AIDS (known as UNAIDS). Dr. Mann liked

the idea, permitted it, and consent with the proposal that the

initial ceremony of the World AIDS Day ought to be 1st December,

1988.

The Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) became

equipped in 1996, it captured the preparation and endorsement of the

World AIDS Day. Before focus on single day UNAIDS made World AIDS

crusade in 1997 to focus on constant communications education and

prevention.

In the year of 2004, World AIDS crusade became a sovereign

organization. From its beginning until 2004, UNAIDS organized the

World AIDS Day operation, selecting annual topics in discussion with

other worldwide health associations.

As of 2008, every year's World AIDS Day idea is chosen through

the World AIDS Campaign's universal Steering Committee following

extensive discussion with organizations, people, and Govt agencies

occupied in the treatment and prevention of HIV/AIDS.

For all World AIDS Day from 2005 through 2010, the subject

will be "Stop AIDS. Keep the Promise" with an annual sub-theme. This

overarching topic is intended to persuade supporting leaders to keep

their pledge to achieve worldwide access to HIV/AIDS treatment,

prevention, support and care by the year 2010.

The theme for World AIDS Day 2010 is 'Universal Access and

Human Rights'. Global leaders have pledged to work towards universal

access to HIV and AIDS treatment, prevention and care, recognising

these as fundamental human rights.

Valuable progress has been made in increasing access to HIV

and AIDS services, yet greater commitment is needed around the world

if the goal of universal access is to be achieved.

Millions of people continue to be infected with HIV every

year. In low- and middle-income countries, less than half of those

in need of antiretroviral therapy are receiving it, and too many do

not have access to adequate care services Published by HT Syndication with

Untied aid is good aid and good economics

BYLINE: DON GREENLEES

SECTION: FEATURES; Pg. 19

LENGTH: 978 words


We should not forget that the essential reason we give aid is to offer
humanitarian assistance

ONE of the odd aspects of the debate about reform of the overseas aid program is
that normally strong advocates of the benefits of open competition and free
trade suddenly become protectionist at the idea of Australian companies facing
foreign competition for Australian aid dollars.

Two weeks ago, the most comprehensive review of the aid program in 13 years was
handed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alexander Downer. The report of a
three-member committee chaired by former Woolworths boss Paul Simons reached the
firm conclusion it was neither good aid nor good economics for lucrative aid
contracts to be open only to bids from Australian companies.

In doing so, it took on one of the pillars of the $1.45 billion aid program: the
"tying" of aid grants to goods and services supplied exclusively by Australian
businesses. Despite a conviction that such a policy was wrong, the report did
not seek overnight change but made three recommendations for gradual reduction
in the share of tied aid.

First, it sought a study of the economic impact of tying Australian aid. Second,
it proposed Australia join donors who support untying aid -Japan, Britain and
The Netherlands -in seeking negotiated global reductions in the level of tied
aid. Third, it wanted to untie aid for the poorest countries (about seven of the
108 recipients) and permit the procurement of goods and services from recipient
country suppliers.

There is ample evidence that tying aid reduces its effectiveness. The
Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development estimated that tying aid added costs of between 10 and 15 per
cent. A 1996 study in Britain found prices of tied aid goods were more than 20
per cent higher on average than the lowest prices available internationally. No
comparable study has been done in Australia, although the situation is, if
anything, likely to be worse because the level of domestic competition is lower.
As a bare minimum, the Government should adopt the recommendation of a study to
find out.

The Simons report took the view that the principal objective of the aid program
should be poverty alleviation. It differed from the 1984 report by Sir Gordon
Jackson, which sought to balance humanitarian, commercial and foreign policy
interests -the so-called "triple". Simons did not suggest that commerce or
foreign policy interests should have no role in the design of the aid program.

There is nothing particularly radical about saying Australia gives aid to make a
net transfer of wealth to less developed countries and that it should do so in
the most efficient manner. But to ignore economics or foreign policy in the
supply of aid is to ignore reality.

Both will inevitably have great bearing on a decision by the Government before
the 1998 federal Budget on whether to adopt the recommendations for a partial
untying of aid.

Australia ties 44.8 per cent of aid or $650 million, compared with an OECD
average of 22.1 per cent. According to the Government's aid agency, AusAID, 363
companies shared business of more than $1 billion in 1995-96 but of this the top
10 contractors alone accounted for $718.6 million. In other words, there is not
a great deal of competition for the bulk of the aid dollar. In the absence of
strong domestic competition it is likely a lot of these businesses would be
ill-prepared to take on international competitors.

  A T the press conference to launch his report, Simons, a man with an
impressive business career behind him, argued that only "invalid companies"
needed to fear reform. If aid were untied, a proportion of aid contracts could
be expected to go offshore in the short term. But in the long term, restricting
competition is unlikely to be in Australia's economic interests. The same
thinking that has driven Australia to become one of the leading champions of
free trade would logically apply to aid contractors.

The British study referred to earlier actually found there were small net
benefits to the economy from a unilateral untying. Britain has become one of a
group of countries demanding all donors untie aid -a push which may lead to an
agreement mandating untied aid under World Trade Organisation rules.

If aid contracts were freed up across the board, Australian companies would
potentially be able to bid for a share of the $16 billion in annual aid
expenditures in South and East Asia alone. It would also increase opportunities
to obtain non-aid business.

Australian companies would have to be competitive. Officials of the Asian
Development Bank, explaining why Australia failed to obtain a bigger slice of
multilateral aid work, have complained that Australian companies were terrible
at putting in bids that conformed with contract specifications. Certainly, there
are examples of companies using tied aid arrangements to showcase their
expertise and gain a successful foothold in Asia. One of the more effective
vehicles was the tied soft-loan scheme, the Development Import Finance Facility,
abolished by the Coalition last year.

While the Simons committee wants to create a new soft-loans scheme, it has
followed the international trend by seeking to do so only on an untied basis.
But the same obvious logic applies to concessional credit as to other parts of
the aid program: if Australian companies are competitive they will get the work.

It is worth bearing in mind why we give aid.

The essential purpose is humanitarian. In the short term, it involves a net loss
of wealth for the donor. But in the long term, the wealth transfer may be repaid
many times over by increased prosperity and the creation of new markets.

INSIDE THE NEWS: OVERSEAS AID: WHO DOES IT HELP?
Large-scale projects such as hydro-electric dams often receive generous funding
from western governments. But is this the right way to help? Martin Bright
examines the controversial issues.

BYLINE: Martin Bright

SECTION: THE GUARDIAN EDUCATION PAGE; Pg. 10

LENGTH: 3520 words


The Pergau dam

This involved the largest sum ( pounds 234 million) ever earmarked by Britain
for an aid project. In 1994, the High Court decided this was an illegal abuse of
the aid system because the dam, an uneconomic project, had been funded for
'wider considerations' including a major arms agreement with Malaysia.  pounds
65 million was returned to the aid budget.

The Lesotho Highlands dam

The Overseas Development Administration is helping to pay for this project which
will capture water from the Maluti Mountains of Lesotho, a small country
surrounded by South Africa. The water will help to meet increasing demand from
industry and the townships of South Africa. The electricity generated will mean
that Lesotho will no longer have to rely on importing electricity from South
Africa.

The Three Gorges dam

A project on the Yangtze river in China which is seen by many as an ecological
disaster. It will alter the ecosystems of three gorges downstream from the dam.
Around 100 towns and villages will be submerged, forcing over one million people
to leave their homes.  There is little support for this project from Western
donors, which is deemed by many to be too controversial. (See map.)

Dams

Dams provide clean water and electricity to large numbers of people. But they
are often controversial because of the vast damage they can cause to the
environment and local communities

Construction work .

Arguments against: There is a danger of corruption with vast inward investment.
A large influx of non-local and/or foreign contract workers may introduce
disease and encourage prostitution.

Arguments for: It may lead to investment in local companies and may also provide
work for local people.

Social

Arguments against: The local population suffers massive displacement. A stagnant
lake encourages the spread of waterborne diseases.

Arguments for: It supplies clean water. Provision of electricity encourages
industrial development.

Economic

Arguments against: Costs of compensation and construction can sometimes oustrip
the projected budget. Income from water and electricity does not cover costs.

Arguments for: Income is generated for the local community at each step of the
project. It provides new infrastructures for water and electricity.

Environment

Arguments against: Rivers silt up. A stagnant lake disrupts the local ecosystem.

Arguments for: Good design minimises the ecological cost, but there will always
be damage with projects of this size.

The big issues

Why has the British government decided to cut foreign aid?

Because it wants to reduce public spending. Foreign aid, like the state
education system or the national health service, is paid for by taxes. Over
pounds 2 billion is spent each year on aid. The Government believes it can save
money for the British taxpayer by reducing aid to developing countries.

What do the cuts mean?

Most cuts are in bilateral aid, the money given directly by one country to
another. These cuts will save around pounds 130 million during the year 1996/7.

A review published by the Overseas Development Administration this month
recommended that in future British aid should focus on 20 of the poorest
countries in the world. Most of these are in Africa, but two of the largest
recipients are India and Bangladesh.

Latin America, the Caribbean and South-east Asia will receive little or no aid
directly from Britain. The Government feels that Britain is paying enough to
these countries through multilateral agencies such as the World Bank, the
European Union and the United Nations.

Isn't foreign aid a moral obligation?

The United Nations certainly thinks so and sets an aid target for the countries
that give aid to the developing world. These so-called donor nations are
expected to pay 0.7 per cent of their gross national product on aid. After the
cuts are made, Britain's contributions based on current spending plans may fall
to about 0.26 per cent by the end of the century. This means that for every
pounds 100 Britain earns, 26 pence will be spent on aid.

But aid is not given for purely selfless reasons. More than one third of all
British aid is 'tied'. This means that in return for aid, the country agrees to
buy goods and services from Britain. According to government figures, Britain
earns about pounds 1.40 for every pounds 1 it spends on multilateral aid. Not
everyone feels that aid is justified - some people argue that aid interferes
with freedom of trade and merely encourages developing countries to rely on
hand-outs from the West.

What is the relationship between aid and Third World debt?

Most developing countries owe large debts to financial institutions,
multilateral agencies or other governments. While they are in deep debt,
progress towards solving their poverty is almost impossible.  The poorest, most
indebted countries use pounds 1 in every pounds 5 they earn through exports to
service their debt and by having to sell export commodities at often very low
prices.

So how is all this aid used?

Much of the government aid given to developing countries goes straight into the
treasury of the recipient country to balance its budget. Some of that money is
spent on imports, some goes to pay off debt.  The hope is that countries with a
stable economy will then be able to invest money in projects such as roads,
education and health services and in other projects which will help them to
generate their own wealth. Some aid is given to support these activities and
projects.

So who makes the decisions about how aid is spent?

This remains one of the hottest topics in the area of overseas aid. Most
governments of recipient nations feel that they should say how aid they receive
is distributed. But as the western nations have the money, they also have the
power and it is unlikely they will give it up. The western nations often put
conditions on aid, which might involve recipient nations showing they are
willing to carry out market reforms, or that they have a clean human rights
record.

The palm oil fiasco

In the 1970s and 1980s the World Bank encouraged developing countries to
increase their production of agricultural produce to sell on the world market.
The theory was that this would then produce income which could be spent on
developing manufacturing industry and internal infrastructure such as roads,
hospitals and schools.  The World Bank was particularly enthusiastic about palm
oil. Countries such as Mali and the Philippines were told that there was a gap
in the market and were encouraged to establish plantations. But trouble arose
when the World Bank told several countries the same thing and they all started
to produce palm oil with the help of development loans. This led to a fall in
the price of palm oil and the countries never gained the financial advantages
they had expected.

The debate

Robert Archer is Policy Adviser for Christian Aid

Britain gives about 31 pence in aid out of every pounds 100 of national income -
one tenth of what it spends on defence .  The latest cuts mean that by the year
2000 aid will be even lower - perhaps 25 pence. This is a mean policy to take
into the 21st century. The international campaign against poverty is one of the
great post-war achievements. Poverty is in retreat in most regions. Many
dangerous diseases have virtually disappeared. Fewer small children are dying
and more people live longer.  Aid works!

The thinking behind cuts is that governments should generally spend less and
that aid makes people dependent. It is argued that people become prosperous by
competing and it is forgotten that a country like South Korea was a principal
recipient of aid in the 1950s. Aid can make people passive - but this is true
only when they have no responsibility for how it is used.  They need additional
skills, capital and fair access to markets.

We would like the ODA to spend far more than it does on programmes that directly
reach the very poor.

'Development' is about restoring the rights of those who have none, and meeting
everyone's basic need for food and shelter and personal identity.

Baroness Chalker (right), Minister for Overseas Development

Aid is an important part of Britain's foreign policy. More than one billion
people around the world live in absolute poverty.  Aid is about finding
practical ways of removing some of the barriers to long -term development. This
means helping to bring the developing countries the basic services that we in
the West take for granted - like clean water, sanitation, education and
healthcare. It also means helping them to improve their economic performance and
increase rates of production while protecting the environment.

Last year we provided pounds 2.2 billion in aid to developing countries.
Despite a small cut in our budget for 1996/97, Britain will remain the world's
fifth largest donor at a time when countries like the US, Canada and Italy are
slashing their aid budgets.

About half of our aid goes through multilateral channels, such as the aid
programmes run by the UN, the World Bank and the European Union. The ODA also
works closely with aid agencies like OXFAM and Save The Children. Last year over
16 per cent ( pounds 173 million) of our budget was spent through
non-governmental organisations.

The agencies

The government department which deals with the distribution of aid is the
Overseas Development Administration (ODA).

Aid can be distributed in several ways:

Bilateral aid

1 Direct payments to the government of the recipient country, paid into the
treasury and used to balance the budget. In practice, this often takes the form
of debt cancellation.

2 Payments for individual, nationwide projects such as literacy programmes or
mass innoculation.

3 Localised projects in defined geographical areas, such as a slum
improvement/rehousing scheme or a water project.

Non-governmental organisations (NGOs)

Charities such as Oxfam, Action Aid, Christian Aid and Save the Children work
with governments and multilateral agencies to fund projects in the developing
world. The major aid charities in Britain are funded by supporters and public
donations and by block grants from the Government.

Multilateral agencies

The British government pays money to institutions such as the World Bank, the
United Nations and the European Union, each of which has its own aid programme.
These work with donor and recipient governments and NGOs.

Emergencies

The most high-profile aid campaigns come in times of famine or war. All aid
agencies from governments to NGOs hold special funds to pay for emergencies.

Foreign-aid foes are speaking up

LENGTH: 2149 words



The numbers of hungry, homeless and jobless Americans are growing dramatically.
Their government is spending billions of dollars in aid but not on them, they
grumble.

    The government says it can't afford programs for America's poor, but it
spends $ 15-billion a year that's $ 300-million a week to help Israel build
homes, to help Egypt buy weapons, to help Bangladesh feed its people and to send
military or economic aid to 82 other countries.

    With varying degrees of stridency, many of the country's office-holders and
presidential candidates are saying America should review its priorities.

    "Foreign aid is a dirty word these days," said Karen Donovan, a spokeswoman
for Catholic Relief Services, a Baltimore-based international relief agency.
"Whenever it's election time, it becomes time for foreign-aid bashing. It's
ritualistic, almost."

    Last fall, as presidential candidates stepped up their "America First"
rhetoric, even Congress balked. House members scuttled the $ 15.2-billion
foreign-aid bill they had approved for this year for fear of rousing public
protests. Instead, Congress passed a continuing resolution, allowing $
14-billion to be spent in the same pattern last year's foreign aid was spent.

    Even members of Congress who traditionally support foreign aid use harsh
words when comparing America's willingness to help its own or to help others.

    Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, had this to say: "The
president came to us and said, "There's an emergency in Turkey, let's help them.
Don't worry about the budget agreement.' He said the same thing with respect to
aid to Bangladesh, with respect to aid to people in Iraq, in Israel and other
places. But when it comes to Americans, the president has said, "No, no, no.' "

    Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said he was "outraged to see the first billion
dollars of the peace dividend be used for the Soviet Union.  Rural America is as
close to a depression as it's been since the 1930s."

    Diehard opponents of foreign aid, such as presidential candidate Patrick
Buchanan, use even stronger words.

    "We cannot afford to continue sending out $ 300-million every single week in
foreign aid to socialist and Third World regimes, not one of which has gotten
off Uncle Sam's welfare rolls in 20 years," Buchanan told a New Hampshire
audience. "We can't afford it."

    All these statements fuel continuing misconceptions about foreign aid: that
it is sucking out the life-blood of hard-working Americans, and this country's
citizens will be best served if they get a president bold enough to deliver them
of this burden.

    Actually, Americans spend more on building and repairing their roads in a
year and 20 times as much on defense than they do on foreign aid.

    Cutting foreign aid won't solve the domestic financial crunch. The United
States operates at an annual $ 279-billion deficit. Weeding out foreign aid
would still leave a $ 264-billion hole to fill. And America's resulting
isolation could hurt it even more.

    "Most Americans have an extremely skewed picture of foreign aid," said John
Sewell, president of the Overseas Development Council, a Washington non-profit
group that advocates better U.S.  ties with Third World countries.

    When asked to guess how much their government spends on foreign aid, surveys
have shown that people say it was 20 percent to 30 percent of the budget, or
about $ 300-billion.

    The actual amount is closer to 1 percent, and about one-third of that goes
to just two countries, Israel and Egypt, Sewell said.

    Only a small fraction, less than $ 2-billion, goes to programs for feeding
children, settling refugees, financing AIDS research and building schools and
roads in poor countries.

    It's understandable that Americans are angry, Sewell said. "Our government
has been ignoring domestic needs. But that can be fixed without pitting our
people against poor people in other countries."

    In one sense, Americans are right in guessing that special interests
dominate U.S. foreign aid. But foreign aid tends to benefit U.S.  interests,
congressional favorites and Americans themselves.

    Scan through the foreign-aid bill and you will notice:

     Israel and Egypt have continued to get at least $ 3-billion and $ 2-billion
each in military and economic aid for the last 12 years, their reward for the
U.S.-brokered Camp David peace accord.

     Israel is the only country that gets all its $ 1.2-billion economic aid as
a cash grant within one month of the foreign-aid bill's passage.  Since the U.S.
budget operates at a deficit, that means Americans borrow that amount and
transfer it in a lump sum to Israel. Israel gains an extra estimated $
80-million a year from interest earned from this early transfer.

    Israel uses economic aid to pay back past debts owed to the United States.
Congress has devised a peculiar way to make sure Israel is able to continue
paying it promptly. It requires that Israel's economic aid should always cover
the amount that country is expected to pay back in that year.

     Most food aid is spent on buying food from American farmers. By law, at
least half of food aid must be transported overseas on U.S.-flagged vessels,
even though they may not offer the cheapest rates or the fastest routes.

     $ 5-million a year is given to the Land O' Lakes corporation as part of
programs to improve nutrition. A gift from congressmen from the farm belt, the
company gets a guaranteed market to sell its cheese and a chance to get cultures
that don't eat much cheese hooked on it.

     Irish-American members of Congress and lawmakers with large Irish-American
constituencies allot $ 20-million for economic development in Ireland and
Northern Ireland.

     $ 150-million is spent on fighting America's drug war by intercepting drug
shipments and destroying crops in South American countries.

     $ 9-million is spent to insure U.S. businesses from losses due to political
turmoil in foreign countries.

    With the exception of a few grants to Israel, almost all of the $ 15-billion
allotted is spent in the United States, said Jerry Lipson, a spokesman for the
U.S. Agency for International Aid, the State Department branch that manages
economic-aid programs.

    American universities, churches, relief agencies and corporations get
contracts to implement programs in foreign countries. And military aid, with
some exceptions for Israel, requires foreign countries to buy weapons that are
made in America.

    Giving foreign aid also has helped America get political leverage in other
regions.

    "It's one of the smartest ways for America to exert its influence without
having to send its troops out," says Mark Robbins of the American Jewish
Committee in Washington. Compared to the $ 150-billion a year the United States
spends on the defense of Europe, he says, $ 15-billion for foreign aid is "a
small pittance."

    Aid provides inroads into trade. Of the major importers of U.S.  goods such
as Japan, Korea and Taiwan, 43 out of 50 were past recipients of U.S. foreign
aid, Lipson said. Every billion dollars of exports creates 20,000 jobs in the
United States.

    When the United States renovated a railroad in Tanzania recently, General
Electric got to supply the locomotives. And U.S.  telephone companies got
contracts in Thailand and Egypt when U.S. aid helped pay for better
telecommunications systems in those countries.

    "Foreign aid is not so foreign," Lipson said.

    But Americans have long been opposed to foreign aid, Lipson said.  After
World War II, there was strong public opposition to the Marshall Plan, the huge
infusion of money that rebuilt European economies. U.S. officials had to
persuade the public that if the United States didn't make its presence felt, the
region could fall under Soviet domination. Aid helped the United States reclaim
the regions politically and to find future markets for its goods.

    There is a similar scenario now. The Cold War is over, and although
Americans spent hundreds of billions of dollars arming themselves against the
Soviet Union in the past, they are reluctant to spend their money on relief for
their former enemy.

    Lipson sees it differently.

    "Think of it as having a buck-and-a-half of spending money. If you spent
less than 1 cent of it (in economic aid) and got all this back, you tell me if
it's worth it."

 Candidates' stands on foreign aid
  The presidential election is not likely to change America's distribution of
foreign aid. A president may make requests or deny parts of the foreign-aid
program, but Congress decides who gets what.

    Not all of the presidential candidates have spoken at length about foreign
aid per se.

    Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, for instance, talks about bringing American money
home in terms of the defense budget, by forcing Europe and Japan to pay more of
their own defense costs.

    Here is what some others have to say:



   BUSH: "What aid I have approved has been either for humanitarian purposes or
to advance U.S. national interests."

    He defends aid to the former Soviet Union because its republics have more
than 30,000 nuclear weapons and 2-million soldiers.

    "The purpose of our aid is to help these countries move from highly
militarized societies that pose a danger to all of us to open democratic
societies with which we can enjoy trade and economic relations."

    He asked Congress to increase foreign aid for this year to $ 27.6-billion,
to increase the U.S. contribution to the International Monetary Fund.

    BUCHANAN: would phase out most foreign aid except for such things as
disaster relief.

    "My view is that we in the United States have got to stop looking out for
the whole world, thinking we can carry the burden for the defense of the entire
West, and no one else has to help carry the burden of foreign aid to all the
countries of the world.  We've got to start looking out for America first."


   TSONGAS: Despite the rhetoric against foreign aid, it will never be
abolished, said a spokesman for Tsongas.

    "The reality of it is, it's not going to happen, no matter who's president,"
said Stephen Cohen, a Tsongas spokesman. "People in New York wake up in the
morning and need to know what happened yesterday in Tokyo. We can't isolate
ourselves from the rest of the world."

    He said Tsongas would try to reallocate the foreign-aid budget to ensure it
is better spent. Tsongas will cut military aid and aid that goes for military
bases in countries such as Turkey and Portugal, which are "leftovers of the Cold
War."

    He would divert that money toward more humanitarian aid to the former Soviet
Union and to developing countries.

    KERREY: Supports continuing foreign aid to create a secure world for America
and building fledgling economies overseas into future markets.

    "Those who urge us to "Come home, America' do not understand the post-Cold
War world," Kerrey said in a statement. "We are involved throughout the world
out of enlightened self-interest."

    CLINTON: Said in a speech at Georgetown University, "Make no mistake:
Foreign and domestic policy are inseparable in today's world. If we're not
strong at home, we can't lead the world we've done so much to make. And if we
withdraw from the world, it will hurt us economically at home.

    "We can't allow this false choice between domestic policy and foreign policy
to hurt our country and our economy."

Hill Fight Over AIDS Plan Looms;
Housing Bill Faces Further Cutbacks

BYLINE: Ann Mariano, Washington Post Staff Writer

SECTION: REAL ESTATE; PAGE E1

LENGTH: 1360 words


As the housing needs of homeless AIDS patients mounts, a fight is shaping up in
Congress over how much money should be allotted to help them.

The housing subcommittee of the House Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs
Committee slashed the proposed $ 290 million for the program to $ 150 million
last week and more efforts to scale back the measure are expected, House members
and staff said.

Rep. Marge Roukema (R-N.J.), ranking Republican on the committee, tried to shift
some of the $ 150 million earmarked for the AIDS housing into a program to care
for all ill and homeless people, including AIDS patients. She abandoned the
effort but said she will try again when the full committee considers the
legislation after the Memorial Day holiday.

Roukema is concerned that the bill would require distributing federal housing
aid based on health rather than on income, which is the standard for most
housing assistance, according to an aide. Her effort is drawing objections from
Rep. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), a sponsor of the AIDS measure.

"I'm very much against" Roukema's proposal, Schumer said. "It means AIDS housing
would be shortchanged. We probably would get no AIDS housing."

Schumer predicted a "tough fight" in the committee but said he expects to win.
"There are very strong arguments for our proposal. It ends up saving money
because many of these people are in hospital beds for $ 600 a day."

The desperation of some homeless AIDS patients was vividly described to the
housing subcommittee at hearings in March. John Overrocker, who testified before
the subcommittee, said he knows too well the need for housing. He spent the
Christmas holidays in the Washington bus station, homeless, alone and ill with
AIDS.

"In the daytime sometimes I went over to Union Station and pretended I was
waiting for a train," he recalled.

He left a homeless shelter where he had been sleeping because he was afraid of
contracting infections. For those with AIDS, already weakened by the virus, even
a minor illness can prove life-threatening.

Overrocker now lives in a home for AIDS patients operated by the Whitman Walker
Clinic Inc. in the District.

Overrocker's experience is not unique, according to those who work with AIDS
sufferers. Patients and groups that help them say that of all the burdens faced
by people with AIDS, one of the heaviest is finding a place to live in peace and
as much comfort as their illness allows.

The staggering cost of medical care quickly depletes the financial resources of
AIDS victims while the illness diminishes their earning power, said witnesses at
the hearing. People with the disease become homeless in greater numbers than
other groups and often are turned away from shelters, they said.

The National Coalition for the Homeless reported that there are only three beds
available in the state of Virginia for homeless AIDS victims. Chicago has no
housing for AIDS patients who are homeless, and in Los Angeles, only five out of
42 shelters will accept people with the disease or the virus that causes it, the
coalition said.

Government help has been slow in coming. Peter P. Smith, president of the
Partnership for the Homeless, said the Presidential Commission on the HIV
Epidemic urged the Department of Housing and Urban Development and other federal
agencies in June 1988 to take action, but the plea "apparently ... fell on deaf
ears," he said.

HUD, "assuming that AIDS is inevitably and quickly fatal, has decided that
people with AIDS are not handicapped" under the legal definition because their
impairment "is not expected to be of a long-continued and indefinite duration,"
said Virginia G. Shubert, AIDS project director for the coalition.

In other words, said House Banking Committee Chairman Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez
(D-Tex.), "people with AIDS don't live long enough to qualify" for federal
housing assistance.

HUD has no policy to deny AIDS patients housing, said Mary Brunette, assistant
to HUD Secretary Jack Kemp for policy and communications. But AIDS is not a
condition that legally qualifies its victims for federal housing aid for the
disabled, she said, although people who are handicapped as a result of AIDS are
eligible. Brunette said people may have life-threatening diseases without being
disabled.

The homeless coalition's Shubert said the government's policy means that AIDS
victims "are cut off from even the meager existing housing funds for people with
disabilities including, ironically, McKinney Act funds, named to honor a man who
died of AIDS," Shubert said. Rep. Stewart B. McKinney, the Republican
representative from Connecticut who died in May 1987, was a ranking member of
the housing subcommittee and devoted much of his time to housing legislation.

HUD's denial of funding for people with AIDS "is based on unwarranted
stereotypes," said Robert Greenwald of Harvard University's AIDS Law Clinic.
Many people with AIDS "are living with their disability" and, with new
treatments available, "AIDS is rapidly becoming a chronic illness."

Seattle's public housing agency was one of the first to help AIDS victims,
according to its director. Tired of waiting for a decision on whether AIDS
patients should be given public housing, the Seattle authority began admitting
people with the disease about a year before it got government approval, said the
director, Harry Thomas.

"We expected ... that the reaction of other residents to persons living with
AIDS would be a major obstacle," Thomas said. But public housing residents have
been "very accepting," he said.

Jim Graham, Whitman Walker administrator, said half of the people with AIDS
seeking help at the clinic last year had monthly incomes of less than $ 500.
Increasing numbers of people with AIDS have few financial resources and "as they
live longer, their need for services multiplies," Graham said.

Over the past five years, Whitman-Walker has opened several types of housing,
including group homes and a six-unit apartment building for people who can live
independently. Another facility offers interim care for patients who do not need
hospitalization but are not well enough to live alone, and Whitman-Walker plans
to open a home for mothers with AIDS or the HIV virus and their children.

The AIDS legislation "is one small step in the right direction," but "the entire
sum allocated over two years by this legislation would barely cover the existing
capital cost needs for supportive housing in New York City alone," according to
the homeless coalition's Shubert.

New York City's housing assistance program for people with AIDS "is on the verge
of collapse under the burden of just over 3,000" clients while the city
estimates that up to 10,000 New Yorkers have AIDS, she said.

The proposed AIDS housing legislation is supported by the American Hospital
Association, which recommends an additional authorization for special pediatric
grants to meet specialized boarding-care needs for children with AIDS.

An estimated 700,000 to 1.1 million Americans are infected with the virus that
causes AIDS and most, if not all, will develop AIDS within the next 16 years
unless there is a "significant scientific breakthrough," said Barbara L.
Watkins, vice president of Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas, who testified
for AHA.

AIDS patients often stay in hospitals much longer than necessary because they
have nowhere to go when they leave. In cities where a range of community
organizations assist people with AIDS, the hospital stays are shorter and the
cost of care is substantially lower, Watkins said. For example, she said, the
average length of a hospital stay in New York City in 1986 was 22 days, in
contrast to the 12-day average in San Francisco, where there are more
community-based services.

In addition to Schumer, Reps. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and James A. McDermott
(D-Wash.) sponsored the House AIDS measure.

The Homeless Prevention and Community Revitalization Act of 1990 introduced last
week by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) contains a provision that would spend $
100 million on home health services, including some for low-income people
suffering from AIDS.

AIDS preys on the underclass

BYLINE: Kim Painter

SECTION: LIFE; Pg. 1D

LENGTH: 1016 words


''For the first time in American history, government doesn't have to do anything
to get rid of undesirable people in society,'' Scotkin says.

Scotkin's implication may seem extreme. But the fact is that AIDS, which was
never really a disease only of middle- class, white, gay men, is now
increasingly a disease of poor black and Hispanic drug abusers, their sex
partners and their children - people already crippled by poor education and
abysmal health care.

At the same time, many people in the AIDS trenches sense that the public is
turning its back to the epidemic.

''Public concern and public empathy have already crested. That train has left
the station,'' says George Swales, director of AIDS education at Washington,
D.C.'s Whitman Walker Clinic.

First lady Barbara Bush addressed just that problem Wednesday when she visited a
Washington home for children infected with the AIDS virus and urged compassion
for children and adults with AIDS.  The four children she held were all born to
drug-addicted mothers.

The federal Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, reports 314 of the 447 babies
born with AIDS in 1988 were infected by mothers who used intravenous drugs or
who had drug-using sex partners.  Drug abuse was linked to 33 percent of all
AIDS cases in 1988, up from 27 percent in 1987.

The majority of drug abusers with AIDS are black or Hispanic, and the AIDS toll
among minorities is disproportionate: Blacks make up 11 percent of the
population, but 26 percent of adult AIDS cases and 53 percent of children's
cases; Hispanics make up 7 percent of the population, but 15 percent of adult
AIDS cases and 23 percent of children's cases.

Those statistics make it easy for people in the USA's heartland to dismiss AIDS
as just another distant urban plague, says Dr. Beny Primm, who was the only
black member of a federal AIDS commission that disbanded last year.

''People in Iowa and Montana and Utah are going to say, 'Why should I send my
tax money to New York where people are living on welfare and having too many
babies and dying of AIDS,' '' says Primm, director of the Addiction Research and
Treatment Corp.  ''The blacking and browning of AIDS fuels the racism that
already exists.''

Others say hostility towards homosexuals, who still account for the majority of
AIDS cases, continues to dampen public concern about AIDS.

''It's difficult to say who's more unpopular - gay men or drug users,'' says
Carisa Cunningham, spokeswoman for Gay Men's Health Crisis in New York City.
''But at least gay men were able to organize and help each other. IV drug users
don't organize.''

Government officials say they're making considerable efforts to educate all USA
residents about AIDS, but are concerned about apathy too.

''My biggest fear is that the media is going to lose interest and stop covering
it because they feel it's no longer a problem of their readership,'' says C.
Frederick Kroger, the CDC's AIDS education chief.

Many of the AIDS stories that have been published recently emphasize that AIDS
doesn't seem likely to explode among white heterosexuals.

''You can track the level of interest in the epidemic by tracking news stories
about heterosexual transmission. When they say it's not exploding, interest goes
down,'' says Carol Levine, executive director of the Citizens Commission on
AIDS, New York City.

But the commission recently released a report saying AIDS affects everyone in
New York, where 8,000 people are living with AIDS and up to 200,000 more are
infected with the AIDS virus.

Everyone feels the pinch as AIDS cases overburden health care systems and social
services, Levine says. AIDS also creates wrenching social dilemmas. Within the
next few years, she says, New York will have 10,000 orphans whose parents have
died of AIDS.

But the impact of the epidemic doesn't stop at the city limits of New York or
Miami.

Many experts fear the disease may yet come to roost in Middle America, and in a
most heartbreaking way: They believe cases may skyrocket among sexually active
young adults of all races and socio-economic classes.

''Teens are still experimenting with sex,'' says Lynn Vance of the National AIDS
Network, Washington. ''There's a potential for explosion in that population, and
that's got to be a concern for the entire heterosexual population.  The virus
can cross over all lines.''

That prospect already isringing alarm bells in urban minority communities, where
fledgling AIDS education efforts often focus on teens.

With a lot of teens, AIDS is still ''like a brand new subject,'' says Cecile
Corletto, 20, an actress in a Los Angeles theater group that teaches the facts
of AIDS to Hispanic teen-agers.

Private and public groups also are targeting adults, taking to city streets
armed with condoms, needle-cleaning tips and drug treatment information.

But minority advocates say efforts by and for minorities aren't everything they
could be, partly because government has been slow to fund education and
treatment programs and partly because many blacks and Hispanics don't want to
believe AIDS is their problem.

Unfortunately, some say, there's been no black or Hispanic Rock Hudson to get
the attention of minorities.

Max Robinson, the former network anchorman who died of AIDS in December, might
have had an impact if he had chosen to talk about his disease before his death,
says Mencer D. Edwards, executive director of the National Minority AIDS
Council.  But the posthumous reports about Robinson's disease probably had
little effect on most blacks, Edwards says.

Another problem is that inexperienced minority groups often find themselves
competing for funding and public attention with well-organized groups backed by
gay men.

''The epidemic is now much more diverse than it was in 1982, and so our advocacy
must be much more diverse,'' Edwards says.

Swales, of Washington's Whitman Walker Clinic, says, ''At the street level,
there is a great deal of effort to get something going. But at the level of
influence, among people who have resources, there's still a lot of
handwringing.''

Why Professor Hollows was right about AIDS

BYLINE: Geoffrey Barker

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 13

LENGTH: 1043 words


THE Australian AIDS lobby has responded hysterically to Professor Fred Hollows'
suggestion that people likely to introduce AIDS into Aboriginal communities
ought to be monitored or controlled.

He has been called "irrational", "dangerous", and "homophobic" for daring to say
that in rural Aboriginal Australia the containment of AIDS "may require
exclusion of infected people from some aspects of community life".

The headlong rush to condemn Professor Hollows says less about the quality of
his argument than it does about the collective mind-set of the AIDS lobby when
confronted by a serious challenge to its priorities and policies.

In fact, the argument made by Professor Hollows, a great-hearted humanitarian,
is simple, powerful, and altruistic. The response from the AIDS lobby is
unconvincing, irrelevant and self-serving.

Essentially, Professor Hollows has argued as follows: 1. At present rural
Aboriginal Australia is, to the best of our knowledge, free from AIDS.

2. Living conditions and rates of sexually transmitted disease in some rural
Aboriginal communities suggest that an AIDS epidemic would be devastating. (This
is a reference to the tragedy of alcoholism and the reality of promiscuity in
some rural Aboriginal communities.) 3. AIDS is incurable and inevitably fatal.
Medical knowledge is limited to how to contain AIDS and prevent new cases from
occurring.

4. Most current Australian AIDS sufferers are male homosexuals and
or/intravenous drug-users, but AIDS is decimating men, women and children in
African communities that are strikingly similar to Australian rural Aboriginal
communities.

5. Therefore Aboriginal communities ought to consider whether persons infected
or possibly infected with AIDS ought to be monitored and possibly excluded from
some aspects of community life. (Obvious candidates for monitoring would be
Aboriginals who had been in jails where homosexual acts and drug-use are
common.) This seems to me a strong prudential argument from public health
considerations. It is not homophobic: it reflects no fear and loathing of AIDS
carriers. It is not an argument for blanket quarantining of AIDS carriers. It is
not an attack on the civil rights of AIDS carriers. It is a proposal to protect
the rights _ and health _ of people not yet infected by AIDS.

The AIDS lobby, however, has chosen to attack Professor Hollows' argument as
counterproductive and/or ill-informed.

The "counterproductive" argument seems to be that what Professor Hollows said
might be reasonable, but that his remarks were unhelpful largely because they
might alienate homosexuals whose cooperation was essential in containing the
spread of AIDS.

Those arguing that Professor Hollows was "ill-informed" seemed to stress that
any attempt at controlling AIDS carriers might jeopardise Australia's
comparatively good record in containing AIDS by "driving the disease
underground".

BOTH sorts of arguments rely on premises and assumptions more doubtful than
those made by Professor Hollows. They assert, on slim statistical evidence, and
largely anecdotal personal testimony, that AIDS carriers nowadays are
overwhelmingly careful and responsible in their sexual behavior.

Even if true, this claim in no way affects the argument made by Professor
Hollows. He is concerned about rural Aboriginal communities where alcoholism and
promiscuity are endemic and where the impact of educational campaigns is, at
best, marginal. What might or might not mostly be the case in urban white
Australia is beside the point.

The "counterproductive" argument relies on the dangerous, if unstated
assumption, that a diplomatic silence should be maintained about some aspects of
the AIDS epidemic in order to ensure the continued cooperation of homosexuals.
(Ironically, it is the homosexuals themselves who have campaigned under the
slogan, imported from the US, "Silence Kills".) The silence desired by the AIDS
lobby seems to cover any detailed discussion about the sexual behavior of
homosexuals after learning that they are carrying the AIDS virus. Professor
Hollows inconveniently pointed out that he had two AIDS-infected nephews _ one
now dead _ who remained intensely promiscuous in the late stages of their
infection. "I have been told by people with terminal AIDS of their unprotected
orgies," he said.

Professor Hollows' critics insist that the rate of new infection among
homosexuals is low because, as Professor John Dwyer said, most infected men are
horrified that they may have infected someone. Some had even abandoned sex, he
added. Note Dr Dwyer's "most" and "some". Again that may or may not be
reassuring in white urban Australia. But Professor Hollows' point is that one
uncaring sexually active AIDS carrier in rural Aboriginal Australia may be
enough to unleash possibly genocidal devastation.

THE AIDS lobby also prefers silence about any implicitly or explicitly
judgmental view about people, especially homosexuals, whose behavior is likely
to contribute to the spread of AIDS. It was particularly outraged by Professor
Hollows' condemnation of Sydney's Gay Mardi Gras and his observation that the
late Stuart Challender should have been asked if he had practised safe sex after
being diagnosed with AIDS.

But it is not homophobic to condemn public display of, and proselytising for, a
lifestyle that carries a real risk of infection with a fatal disease. Nor would
it have been an invasion of Stuart Challender's privacy to ask him, during the
interviews he gave towards the end of his life, how his sexual behavior was
affected when he learned he had AIDS.

AIDS sufferers are entitled to compassion, understanding and access to whatever
medical care is available. But the rest of us (especially, perhaps, Australia's
rural Aboriginal communities) are entitled to know that steps to limit the
spread of AIDS are not being avoided because of pressure from AIDS activists who
demand public sympathy while refusing to acknowledge personal responsibility for
careless or compulsive behavior within their ranks.

Fred Hollows, as always, stood up for the least powerful and most vulnerable
Australians when he addressed the Aboriginal AIDS-HIV conference in Alice
Springs. He has not been diminished by the efforts of the AIDS establishment to
shout him down.

WOMEN AND AIDS: ASSESSING THE RISKS

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

SECTION: Section A; Page 16, Column 2; Style Desk

LENGTH: 1834 words


As AIDS becomes more widely dispersed in the population, more women who may once
have perceived the disease as largely confined to men are worrying about their
own risks of infection. Almost half of the nation's women with AIDS live in New
York City, and more than four-fifths of these are black or Hispanic women.
According to city health officials, as many as 1 in 15 residents may now harbor
the AIDS virus.

Scientists stress that AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is not
spreading randomly and that those who follow certain precautions face little or
no danger. The virus believed to cause AIDS has been known to spread only
through intimate sexual contact, the sharing of needles by intravenous drug
users or via blood or blood products.

Of the more than 14,000 Americans diagnosed with AIDS as of mid-October, fewer
than 1,000 were women. Male homosexuals and bisexuals, intravenous drug users
and hemophiliacs constitute the so-called AIDS risk groups and account for
nearly all the cases. The number of victims of AIDS, which causes a collapse of
the body's disease-fighting ability, is expected to double in the next year.
Half of the AIDS patients have died; there is no known cure or vaccine.

Just how frequently, and by what means, the AIDS virus is being passed among
heterosexuals remains clouded by uncertainties, but knowledge is growing month
by month as patterns are discerned in the rising number of cases. The answers
given here are based on interviews with a dozen Federal, city and academic
researchers, as well as recently published findings about women's risks of AIDS.
Q.

How many women have AIDS? A. As of Oct. 15, the cases of 916 adult women with
AIDS had been reported to the Federal Government. Nationwide, the proportion of
AIDS patients who are women has remained around 7 percent for several years;
cases are doubling annually, but there are no signs of a sudden new surge of the
disease among women.

In New York City, 447 women have been reported to have AIDS, as of Oct. 18. Of
these, a highly disproportionate 85 percent are black and Hispanic women, a
reflection of the ravages of drug addiction among minorities, city officials
say. Q. How have women contracted AIDS? A. About half the American women with
AIDS have been intravenous drug users who apparently were infected with the
virus from shared needles. Only 126 cases, or 1 in 7 of all women's cases, have
been attributed to heterosexual intercourse, and most of these involved partners
who were drug users. One in 10 women with AIDS contracted the virus from blood
transfusions, which were not screened for AIDS until last spring.

New York and northern New Jersey show an unusual concentration of AIDS in both
sexes that is related to intravenous drug use, especially among minorities. More
than 60 percent of New York City's women with AIDS have been drug addicts. Q.
How many women harbor the AIDS virus? A. Federal experts believe that for every
person diagnosed with AIDS, between 50 and 100 others, most of them still
healthy, are infected with the virus; hence, between 700,000 and 1.4 million
individuals may be carriers nationwide. In New York City, an estimated 400,000
to 500,000 - or up to 1 in 15 residents -are now infected, according to Dr.
Charles Rabkin, an epidemiologist with the city's Health Department. About
50,000 to 100,000 women around the country, perhaps 40,000 in New York alone,
may now harbor the AIDS virus.

Scientists assume that nearly all the infected men and women fall in the known
risk groups, but some who contracted the virus by transfusions or from
heterosexual intercourse may be unsuspecting carriers. Q. What does infection
with the virus mean? A. All virus carriers, whether male or female, are presumed
capable of spreading the virus, known as HTLV-III or LAV, to others through
intimate sexual contact or transfers of blood. From 5 to 10 percent of them have
developed full-scale AIDS within 5 years of infection, while another 20 percent
have developed swollen lymph glands, weight loss and other symptoms of AIDS
-related complex. Scientists believe carriers may be infected for life, but the
percentage that will remain healthy or that will ultimately develop AIDS or
other diseases will be learned only as time passes.

Infected women who have not become ill themselves have passed the disease to
their newborns, and doctors warn virus carriers against pregnancy. Q. Is AIDS
spreading among heterosexuals? A. Only 1 percent of AIDS cases in the United
States are attributed to heterosexual intercourse, and this percentage has
remained constant for years, according to Dr. Harold Jaffe, the chief AIDS
epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. The average lag
time between viral infection and development of AIDS is at least several years,
so if the virus has recently begun spreading more widely among American
heterosexuals, as some experts fear, this will only become apparent in the years
ahead.

In central Africa, equal numbers of women and men have developed AIDS, but the
patterns of transmission there remain poorly documented and the importance of
sexual intercourse versus contaminated needles and other means of spreading the
disease is unknown. Q. Are some sexual practices riskier than others? A.
Evidence indicates that a woman can contract the AIDS virus through vaginal,
anal or oral intercourse with an infected man, but that some practices may pass
the virus more readily than others. Anal intercourse often causes tearing of
tissue and, many scientists theorize, may allow more of the virus in semen to
enter the bloodstream directly. But vaginal intercourse is clearly the source of
AIDS in many women.

Federal experts advise against kissing involving the exchange of saliva with
individuals who are likely to be infected, although no cases of AIDS have been
ascribed to kissing. Most scientists consider a light peck on the cheek or lips
to be safe.

The more different sex partners a woman has, the greater the chances of exposure
to the AIDS virus. Some scientists also believe that repeated encounters with
the virus may facilitate the development of the syndrome. Q. Do condoms prevent
transmission of the virus? A. According to the Centers for Disease Control,
''consistent use of condoms should assist in preventing infection with HTLV-III/
LAV, but their efficacy in reducing transmission has not yet been proven.'' Q.
Can women transmit the virus to men? A. The evidence of female-to-male sexual
transmission of the virus remains sketchy, but Dr. Jaffe said, ''We have to
presume it occurs.'' If so, it has occured only rarely in the United States: sex
with an infected woman has been strongly implicated as the source of AIDS in
only 16 men. In scores of other unexplained cases, intercourse with women is the
suspected source. In Africa and Haiti, many men with AIDS report numerous sexual
partners or frequent visits to prostitutes.

Most scientists believe that female-to-male sexual transmission is possible but
much less ''efficient'' than the reverse. This is true of gonorrhea, which
spreads from men to women more often than from women to men. And among
homosexual men, the receptive partners in anal intercourse face the highest risk
of AIDS infection.

Federal experts assume the AIDS virus can be present in menstrual blood and in
cervical and vaginal secretions, although this has not yet been established. Q.
Are prostitutes spreading AIDS? A. Again, the evidence is scanty.

Studies have shown that some prostitutes, mainly drug addicts in American
cities, are carrying the virus, but few if any men's cases of AIDS can be
unequivocally linked to them. Studies of soldiers with AIDS who say they have
had no homosexual or intravenous drug experiences, and of unexplained cases
among civilian men, have found a frequent history of multiple visits to
prostitutes.

New York health officials note that intravenous drug use is rampant among the
prostitute subgroup known as streetwalkers, and that studies indicate at least
half of the city's addicts carry the AIDS virus. They do not believe, however,
that any men in New York have contracted AIDS from a prostitute. Doctors at New
York University Medical Center think one of their patients did.

Dr. Rabkin of the city's Health Department says the risk of a man's being
infected by rare past visits to prostitutes is ''nonexistent for all practical
purposes.'' But many private doctors say the threat of AIDS is a powerful reason
not to consort with prostitutes. Q. Is artificial insemination safe? A. While no
cases of AIDS from this source have been reported in the United States, four of
eight Australian women who received frozen sperm from a symptomless carrier of
the AIDS virus have shown signs of infection. Experts say women should insist on
frozen sperm from a company that tests donors for AIDS infection, preferably one
that does not release sperm until the donor has been tested a second time after
a few months. They generally recommend against the use of fresh sperm, although
careful screening and testing of the donor should make this safe.

The Idant Laboratories of New York, the world's largest frozen-sperm bank, says
it began testing the blood of donors for signs of the AIDS virus as soon as the
procedure was approved last spring and had refused homosexual donors long before
that. Q. How can a person find out if he or she is carrying the AIDS virus? A.
At present in New York City, the blood test for AIDS virus antibodies can only
be arranged through one's personal physician. Doctors send the blood sample,
without the patient's name, to a Health Department research program for testing.
The presence of AIDS antibodies, when confirmed by two different procedures,
indicates probable ongoing infection with the virus. City officials, concerned
that people taking the test receive proper counseling about its meaning, are
debating whether to establish anonymous testing centers like those in many other
cities. People deciding to take the test should be aware that a finding of
possible infection could be psychologically devastating and that some civil
libertarians are concerned about possible breaches of confidentiality. Q. How
can a woman reduce her risk of AIDS? A. Leading AIDS experts at the Centers for
Disease Control, such as Dr. Jaffe, advise against sex with men in the
identified risk groups - bisexuals, intravenous drug users or hemophiliacs.
Those who cannot follow this proscription should use condoms.

''It's appropriate at this point to be very careful about who you have sex
with,'' said Dr. Michael Marmor of the New York University Medical Center. ''Get
to know the person well, and talk frankly about sexually transmitted disease. If
there is any doubt about possible past exposures, both people should get
themselves tested.''

But overall, Dr. Jaffe said, ''the chances of infection for a heterosexual not
having sex with any risk-group members are extremely low.''

Abstinence, faithfulness better against AIDS than condoms

BYLINE: Susan Martinuk, For The Calgary Herald

SECTION: THE EDITORIAL PAGE; Susan Martinuk; Pg. A22

LENGTH: 856  words


The problem of Africa was a major theme of discussion at this week's G-8 summit
in Japan. The solution -- as it inevitably is when political leaders decide to
solve a problem -- was financial aid. They reaffirmed a previous commitment to
spend $60 billion over the next five years to fight AIDS and other infectious
diseases that are devastating the African continent.

According to the UN, G-8 AIDS funding reached a record-breaking $6.6 billion in
2007. The current projected figures will certainly surpass that sum to produce a
new record for AIDS spending in Africa, yet it's still not enough for global
AIDS leaders.

They say the commitment falls "short of expectations" and tossed out the figure
of $173 billion as being more realistic (which it might be if AIDS was the
world's only problem).

But even as the elites in the AIDS bureaucracy were demanding more, the
potential aid recipients were likely cringing at the thought of billions more
coming their way from the West -- because they know any aid will be tied to full
acceptance of a western agenda to stem the tide of AIDS. They also know that
agenda simply won't work in Africa (heck, it doesn't even work here).

A damning indictment of the West's attempts to save Africa from AIDS appeared in
the June 30 issue of the Washington Post. The writer was Sam L. Ruteikara,
co-chair of Uganda's National AIDS Prevention Committee, and he essentially told
the American Senate (currently debating a $50-billion AIDS relief package for
Africa) to butt out of Africa's AIDS problem and "let my people go."

He's not being ungrateful. He's being realistic in pointing out that the AIDS
prevention strategies so eagerly supplied by the western experts (who also
control the financial aid) have only served to increase HIV infections in his
country.

Although Uganda sits in the heart of sub-Saharan Africa where tens of millions
are infected and 76 per cent of the world's 2007 AIDS deaths occurred, it stands
alone as a nation that has developed a successful home-grown strategy to combat
AIDS.

From 1991 to 2002, the number of Ugandans infected with HIV dropped from 21 to
six per cent. Between 1989 and 1995, the number of men having three or more
sexual partners in a year dropped from 15 to three per cent.

By comparison, strategies in Canada have yet to demonstrate such success. It is
estimated that there were anywhere from 1,800 to 3,200 new HIV infections in
1993; by 2005, those numbers had risen to 2,300 and 4,500.

So what's Uganda got that we don't have?

It's not complicated. Ugandan leaders simply recognized -- and acknowledged --
that the main reason for the spread of HIV was people having sex with more than
one partner. So they urged people to be faithful. Their highly successful
message was ABC (Abstain, Be faithful or use Condoms).

The condom message was preached -- but only as a last resort.

The dramatic drop in HIV infections in a high-risk country was heralded as the
AIDS success story of the '90s, but it was virtually ignored by the West's AIDS
power brokers, who were obviously confounded by the simplicity of the campaign
(it cost just 29 cents per person per year) and, more importantly, offended by
the notion that the message of sexual monogamy could trump condom use.

So they quickly took hold of the principle that "if everything seems to be going
well, you have obviously overlooked something" and complained to the
international community that Ugandans were "wrong to try to limit people's
sexual freedom."

They then wielded the power of their AIDS support dollars to create a new,
westernized strategy for prevention that ignored any mention of
faithfulness/abstinence and focused instead on, you guessed it, the almighty
condom.

The strategy also "altered" statistics to suggest that the HIV infection rate
among married couples was 42 per cent instead of the 6.3 per cent determined by
previous surveys.

When the statistic was questioned, the AIDS advisers who had assumed control of
Uganda's AIDS prevention program refused to provide the source.

The result of this new strategy? Ugandan HIV rates went up.

Nicely done, international AIDS "experts." You managed to nip success in the bud
by supplanting a successful and proven prevention strategy with one that
exacerbates HIV infection rates.

For any who still question whether AIDS strategies for prevention and education
are rooted more in ideology than science, the answer is clear.

Our western commitment to foster sexual freedom at any cost is clearly at odds
with our stated goals of preventing HIV infection -- both here and in Africa.

Promoting monogamy reduces AIDS and costs pennies in comparison to the billions
of dollars we invest in AIDS prevention strategies.

This money is needed for AIDS treatment and medicine, and we are tossing it to
the wind by making our global battle against AIDS far more complicated and
costly than it needs to be.

No wonder Ruteikara derides western aid. No wonder he writes: "We understand
that casual sex is dear to you, but staying alive is dear to us. Listen to
African wisdom, and we will show you how to prevent AIDS."

'AIDS greatest public health challenge'

SECTION: Vol. 26 No. 268

LENGTH: 683  words


In connection with World AIDS Day on Thursday (today), Shaukat Khanum Memorial
Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, Chief Executive Officer and Consultant
Infectious Diseases, Dr Faisal Sultan said AIDS is still one of the greatest
public health challenges faced by low and middle-income countries.

In a statement issued on Wednesday, Dr Faisal Sultan said there are 36.7 million
individuals living with AIDS in the world. AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency
Syndrome) is the last stage of HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) when the body
can no longer fight life threatening infections. A patient is diagnosed with
AIDS when the patient's CD4 count falls below the defined threshold. The
development of Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) marks the latest advancement in the
treatment of HIV due to which HIV positive patients can now expect to lead a
long and healthy life. He shared that this potentially fatal disease exists in
almost every country. HIV is mainly transmitted through blood and sexual
intercourse. However, today, the advancement in medicine has helped in
controlling this disease to a great extent compared to the past. According to
the National AIDS Control Programme, Pakistan has about a 100,000 patients
suffering from AIDS.

Dr Faisal Sultan informed the journalists that due to the cooperation of Punjab
AIDS Control Programme facilities to provide treatment and other services to the
patients of AIDS are now available in various hospitals in Punjab. Dr Faisal
Sultan stated that the symptoms of AIDS include consistent weight loss, skin
diseases, and repeated occurrence of infections such as pneumonia. Speaking
about the preventive measures, Dr Sultan emphasised on public awareness about
the transmission of HIV such as avoiding used syringes, transfusion of blood
that is not screened, and unprotected sex.

Dr Faisal Sultan also discussed that unfortunately, a social stigma is
associated with AIDS and there is a need to create public awareness about the
fact that AIDS cannot be transmitted just by having a conversation or eating
together. We should treat AIDS patients with compassion.

In a message to the public, he said that although AIDS is not curable at this
point in time, however, treatment is available that can significantly improve
the quality of life of AIDS patients. We can control AIDS by raising awareness
about causes, symptoms, and prevention about this disease among the public.
Instead of stigmatising or getting afraid of AIDS, it is important to seek a
doctor and get treatment. AIDS Day on 1st December on Thursday (today), Shaukat
Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, Chief Executive Officer and
Consultant Infectious Diseases, Dr. Faisal Sultan said that AIDS is still one of
the greatest public health challenges faced by low and middle-income countries.

In a statement issued here on Wednesday, Dr. Faisal Sultan said that there are

Embracing First Aid Culture [analysis]

BYLINE: Martins Ifijeh

LENGTH: 1680 words


The knowledge of first aid is important for everyone in any society. But this
knowledge is lacking among many Nigerians, writes

Despite the fact that everyone wants to live a life of certainty devoid of
unfortunate incidents, life presents its own characteristics which involves the
good and predictable life we want and the ones we may wished away.

Accidents are parts of such happenings we wished never come our way, but
unfortunately, they are parts of our lives and they happen everyday, be it
natural or man made, ranging from road accidents, domestic accidents, sudden
illness, or even bomb blasts.

For instance, each year, more than 1.24 million people die in road crashes, and
about 50 million experience one form of bodily harm or the other from road
accidents, according to World Health Organization (WHO) Global Statistics.

This is just one form of accidents that happen every day and many of the deaths
and injuries occasioned by it could be avoided if people were trained in basic
first aid and were able to provide appropriate and rapid response.

According to Nigeria's Federal Road Safety Commission (FRSC), over 6,000 deaths
occur every year due to road traffic crashes in the country with about 21,000
people sustaining various degrees of injuries. Although, the WHO disagreed with
this figure, claiming that 32,000 deaths occur in the country annually,
indicating an average of 87 deaths per day due to road accidents alone.

The fact that every Nigerian should be able to provide palliative assistance
when accidents come calling, either in the home, workplace or public places,
therefore strengthens the resolve that knowledge of basic first aid is essential
for everyone.

According to experts, first aid is the assistance given to any person suffering
a sudden illness or injury with care provided to preserve life, prevent the
condition from worsening, or promote recovery. This includes initial
intervention in a serious condition prior to professional medical help being
available, such as performing Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) while
awaiting an ambulance, stopping bleeding, as well as the complete treatment of
minor conditions, such as applying a plaster to a cut.

First aid is generally performed by the layperson, with many people trained in
providing basic levels of first aid, and others willing to do so from acquired
knowledge.

THISDAY investigations revealed that majority of Nigerians have no knowledge of
how to offer first aid, either to accident victims, other persons who need
health emergency aid, their family members or even to themselves. The
investigation also showed that most homes and offices in the country have no
first aid kits.

For instance, when a business woman who owns a boutique in Lagos, Caroline, was
asked if she had knowledge of basic first aid, she explained that she has never
received any training on first aid and does not know what a typical first aid
kit contains. Caroline believes only health personnels should have knowledge of
how to use a first aid.

Also, for a 29 years old fitness centre administrative assistant, FunkeLanre,
having knowledge of first aid is thought to be exclusively for health
professionals. "I thought only health professionals like nurses and doctors can
administer first aid to people especially during accidents and other health
emergencies. Though my organisation has a first aid box at the reception, it is
controlled by the physiotherapist working with our customers. No other staff has
been taught how to use it. The only thing I know is that there are paracetamol
tablets in the first aid pack. I can't conveniently say I know about other tools
in the pack," she added.

Lanre gave a scenario in which she and some passengers were involved in motor
accidents but non could get first aid from other motorists until they all went
to a nearby hospital, which ideally should be the second line of action after
administering first aid to accident victims.

"When the bus I was traveling in had an accident, we resulted to self help even
when there where other motorists plying the road, non could come down to assist
us. Some passengers were profusely bleeding until we all went to a nearby
hospital to treat ourselves," she added.

In the same vein, Jude Idehen, a data officer who works in a media firm in
Ilupeju estate, has no knowledge of the use of first aid. "I know first aid kit
is a very important valuable to own in a home, but I have never thought of
getting one. And I'm not sure there is any one in my office, though I have not
taken the pain to find out from our admin officer. If there is, I'm sure it
would have been displayed in an open place for every one to see."

Idehen who is a father of three, admitted that his kids have at one time or the
other injured themselves while playing, both at school and at home, with no
immediate measure to treat the injuries.

For an accountant in one of the banks in Lagos, Isaac Alao, who says he has
training in the use of first aid because he was a Red Cross club member during
his National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) days, however said he does not have any
first aid kit in his home, as well as in his car.

"My office has a first aid kit stationed in an open place within the building
where any staff can go get drugs, bandages and other first aid tools needed for
an ideal office like mine. Generally, Nigerians do not have the culture of
getting trainings on how to use first aid, talk less of even getting one."

Alao believes one of the major reasons for the poor use of first aid by
individuals, families and even organizations is lack of awareness. "The way the
government has made it mandatory for vehicles, households and even offices to
own fire extinguishers has really helped in that regards. Government can make
same policy such that every office, homes and vehicles in the country will have
first aid kits," he added.

There are millions of Nigerians like Caroline, Lanre and Idehen who knows
nothing about first aid culture and perhaps feel there is no need to own one,
thereby putting their lives, that of their families and people around them in
harms way, especially when the need arise for them to use first aid. There are
as well several Nigerians like Alao who, though knows how to administer first
aid, but do not see reasons to own one in their homes or offices.

But the case was however different for Mr. Moses Ogala, who works with one of
the non governmental organizations in Lagos, he has a mini first aid kit in his
car and is knowledgeable on what to do in accident situations.

He said the organization where he work organized first aid trainings for them.
"So as it is now, I know exactly what to do during medical emergency situations.
That is also why I had to get a small kit for my self. Though it does not
contain every tool in a standard first aid box, at least there is spirit, drugs,
bandages, neurogelsics, scissors and so on. The kit is constantly in my car," he
added.

In an interview with a commandant of Nigeria Red Cross Society, Edo State
branch, Deborah Ofeinmu, she believes Nigerians generally do not have the
culture of making adequate preparations to guide against issues or challenges.

According to her, that same attitude was why majority of persons do not think of
having first aid boxes in their offices, houses or even in their cars.

"This is one of the responsibilities of the Red Cross organisation to enlighten
people on the need to be knowledgeable on how to administer first aid. We
believe it should not be the exclusive preserve of a health professional or a
Red Cross member. Every one should have it as well.

"Having it around is however a vital initial step to providing effective and
swift action that helps reduce serious injuries and improve the chances of
survival. Taking immediate action and applying appropriate techniques, while
waiting for professional help, can considerably reduce deaths and injuries in
the country," she added.

Ofeinmu said Nigerians need to attend first aid trainings as this would be
needed some day, either by themselves, relations, friends or neighbors. "There
is need for training to learn the recognised first aid practices so we can save
our lives, we need to inculcate first aid trainings to our schools, private and
public sectors, to all parastatals, groups and agencies.

"There should be a law stating that every candidate who seeks a driving license
should also be knowledgeable in first aid. Each driver would have a valid first
aid certificate which is renewed every five years."

Ofeinmu who has been a member of the organisation since 1998 said, "A typical
first aid kit should contain adhesive bandages, disinfectant, pain killers,
disposable gloves, scissors, trauma shears, emergency blanket, defibrillator and
many more equipments based on trainings and availability.

"Among the basic supplies needed to be packed in the first aid kit is adhesive
tape, aluminum finger splints, antibiotic ointment, antiseptic solution, a roll
of elastic wrap, cotton balls, bandages, instant cold packs, disposable gloves,
gauze, eye goggles, petroleum jelly or other lubricant.

The commandant, who encouraged every Nigerian to attend first aid trainings in
order to be prepared for medical emergencies when the need arise also noted that
her organisation was available for any organisation or individuals who wish to
be trained in first aid.

In an interview with the media, a surgeon at the National Hospital in Abuja, Dr
BadejoOlawage expressed concern over people's lack of knowledge of first aid.
According to him, "one of the major problem accident victims experience is the
lack of knowledge of first aid by ignorant bystanders in crisis situations.

"These people sometimes cause more damage to patients when they even attempt to
administer first aid. Outside those in medical schools and first aid clubs in
schools, the average Nigerian is not knowledgeable about basic first aid
practices. Knowledge of first aid is very essential because when attempting to
save a life, whatever a person does in the first few minutes can be very
important. He added.

China does not support rogue African states, it creates them - report

BYLINE: Mail & Guardian Africa

SECTION: AFRICA

LENGTH: 1332 words



HIGHLIGHT: Africa can expect to witness more incidences of state-sponsored
domestic violence, as Chinese aid increases, a new study shows.


 With China's flagship event showcasing how its influence has grown in Africa
set for the continent this year, the focus will inevitably be on the amount of
new aid and loans Beijing dangles at the continent. The last summit of the
triennial Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (Focac) saw President Hu Jintao put
on the table $20-billion in loans to African countries, doubling its previous
offer.   As bilateral trade volumes have grown, Beijing will be expected to
offer billions more at this year's forum in South Africa, despite its domestic
economy having cooled in recent months. Read: Teaching Mandarin at school 'will
colonise SA anew' - Sadtu However, Africa can also expect to witness notably
more incidences of state-sponsored domestic violence, both against civilians and
competitors such as rebel groups, as Chinese aid increases, a new study shows.
Authors Roudabeh Kishi and Clionadh Raleigh, of the University of Sussex's
Department of Geography, say this effect is largely because aid from China is
fungible, with its use determined by recipient countries. Their working paper,
titled "Chinese Aid and Africa's Pariah States", finds that political violence
by the state increases with receipt of Chinese aid. The same is not observed
with aid from 'traditional' or Western donors, which comes tagged with
conditions.  When money breeds bad ways
Because Chinese aid is disbursed under a "non-interference policy" that does not
seek to influence the domestic policies of recipient states, leaders have a lot
of leeway over where it is used.

"Due to the lack of obvious conditionality, African leaders can use Chinese aid
in the ways they see fit and suited to their political, economic and social
needs. In practice, Chinese aid directly supports the regimes of states," the
authors write. The same effect would be observed with any other country offering
unconditional aid, the researchers told  Mail and Guardian Africa. "Similarly,
if the Chinese model was to mimic traditional aid flows in which aid packages
were to become conditional (and could not be readily used for whatever outcome
the state chooses), then we would assume that these aid flows would result in a
similar outcome as other conditional aid flows."  Critics of Beijing's aid say
that its packages provide funding for pariah states, while undoing the
longer-term benefits from the conditions tied to the aid given by the West.
China has also been accused of only seeking Africa's natural resources, most
notably by US president Barack Obama, and cultivating ties with states accused
of poor human rights so as to rope in supporters for Beijing's own iron-fist
internal model. Surprising finding
But the study, perhaps a bit surprisingly, finds that this is not the position.
While Africa's resources are important for feeding its growth, the world's
second biggest economy also seeks new markets for its goods, and to build
international coalitions with non-Western states including those in Africa, for
pursuits such as support for its "One China" policy. Read: Zuma: China can free
Africa from 'colonial shackles As such, its aid is directed towards whichever
countries satisfy those needs, with a recipient's institutional quality or type
having no bearing on its choices.  "Hence, acknowledged pariah status is not a
pre-requisite for large Chinese aid packages," says the study, noting that aid
from Beijing flows to countries as diverse as South Africa, Ghana, Uganda,
Zimbabwe and Sudan. The only countries that have not benefited from China's aid
have been pro-Taipei Burkina Faso and Swaziland, and The Gambia until it
recently cut ties with Taiwan.  Essentially, China is an "equal-opportunity"
lender.  "Though China isn't specifically giving aid to 'pariah states', it is
making states into pariahs through providing resources to state leaders who are
unafraid to use repression as a means to quell competition," the researchers
noted. The fungibility of China's aid is cited for the "significantly" higher
rates of violence by states, both against competitors and against civilians.
This is evident when compared with aid from traditional donors, and even when
the researchers mitigated for different rates of resource exports and the
strength of the rule of law, and any other aspect of the state which may help
explain existing violence rates. "If the state has complete control over its
budget, it will use its position to bolster its capacity to repress any
potential opposition in order to secure its position," the study noted. Western
aid is not absolved of blame -- it also fuels conflicts by making the "prize" of
rebellion more attractive to insurgents, who would very much like the power to
redistribute it and support patronage networks.  The jury also remains out over
the efficacy of "tied" aid -- while its supporters claimed it had in the
post-Cold War period made African countries better governed, scholars note there
was little evidence of this.  Graph source: ACLED  The study notes that China
has successfully exploited the angst around Western donor preconditions by
leveraging on its policy of non-interference, shared colonial history and by
dangling its recent turbo-charged growth at African leaders. China shifts
And as uptake of its "few-questions" aid took off, Beijing diversified from
project-tied aid into debt cancellation, technical and personnel training help,
and humanitarian aid, even if its aid flows remain significantly less than those
of other international donors. Chinese aid is however not as no-strings-attached
as advertised, the paper highlighted. Its model poses the danger of countries
remaining dependent on resources, while increased competition has also made
African goods uncompetitive among other criticisms such as on labour and
environmental standards. To make their case, the researchers tested whether
levels of armed violence rose with increases in Chinese aid, and whether it was
specifically perpetrated by the state. They also compared the incidence of
violence under Western aid flows, and controlled for variables such as resource
dependence, GDP strength, democracy or lack of, the rule of law, populations and
existing conflict. Some of their findings included that China does not
specifically target countries with more natural resources, and that autocratic
regimes do not generally receive a higher proportion of aid.  Because Chinese
aid is meant to benefit China, they also found that countries with a weaker rule
of law get more aid as they have an environment that allows Chinese business to
flourish. Additionally, increased Chinese aid relative to a state's GDP led to
more incidences of state-supported conflict, while rebel groups or other
conflict actors were not seen to be taking up arms any more due to the
availability of Chinese aid. "In short, Chinese aid increases the ability go the
state to repress domestic competition, opposition and civilians. Compared to
traditional aid, the effect is limited to state forces and goals," said the
study.  This is true even if internal country dynamics are different, it noted,
citing countries such as Ethiopia, Uganda and Zimbabwe. "Often the strategies
and tactics for ensuring regime stability and regime longevity might be outside
the preferred conduct of Western aid donors, hence unconditional/Chinese aid is
attractive. Other scholars have noted the use of Chinese aid for 'prestige'
projects or funnelling money to allies and supporters for the same reasons," the
authors told M&G Africa. But despite this, or perhaps because of it, Chinese aid
has been particularly useful to African leaders seeking to remain in power.  And
due to its win-win relationship, the Sino-African relationship will likely
endure, suggesting traditional donors may have to think of better ways to make
their aid model attractive once again. - Lee MwitiThis article first appeared on

AIDS GROUPS TO MERGE

BYLINE:  DAVID WAHLBERG  dwahlberg@madison.com, 608-252-6125

SECTION: LOCAL; Pg. A3

LENGTH: 411 words


AIDS Network in Madison will merge with Milwaukee-based AIDS Resource Center of
Wisconsin on Feb. 1, a move that will bring a clinic and pharmacy specializing
in HIV/AIDS to Madison, the organizations said Wednesday.

AIDS Network's offices in Madison and Beloit will become part of AIDS Resource
Center, which will close its Madison office and keep open offices in Milwaukee
and seven other locations around the state.

The nonprofits serve nearly half of the estimated 8,000 people with HIV/AIDS in
Wisconsin, which sees about 250 new diagnoses a year.

AIDS Network provides dental care, behavioral health, a food pantry and social,
legal and prevention services. AIDS Resource Center will continue those services
and provide housing assistance, add a clinic and pharmacy, and expand a special
Medicaid reimbursement program to the area, said Mike Gifford, the center's
president and CEO.

"It's an outstanding opportunity for us to really increase access to care for
people living with HIV and AIDS, and hopefully improve their health outcomes and
the quality of their lives," Gifford said.

Dan Guinn, executive director of AIDS Network, will become vice president and
general counsel at AIDS Resource Center.

"It's better to collaborate than it is to compete," Guinn said. "We're going to
be able to sustain what we do and enhance what we do."

Both organizations started in 1985. AIDS Network has 25 employees and a $1.7
million budget, while AIDS Resource Center has 175 employees and a $51 million
budget. There will be no layoff s, Gifford and Guinn said.

AIDS Resource Center's clinics in Green Bay, Kenosha and Milwaukee are staffed
by the center and providers from local health systems Bellin Health and Medical
College of Wisconsin.

The clinic in Madison will have a similar arrangement, though the provider has
not been identified, Gifford said. UW Health and Dean Clinic see most area
patients with HIV/AIDS.

AIDS Resource Center owns a pharmacy in Milwaukee and plans to open one, along
with the clinic, at the AIDS Network office on Williamson Street, Gifford said.

AIDS Resource Center's other offices are in Appleton, Eau Claire, La Crosse,
Superior and Wausau.

Of the 255 new cases of HIV diagnosed in Wisconsin last year, 41 percent were
among blacks, 40 percent were among whites and 15 percent were among Hispanics,
according to the state Department of Health Services.

About 85 percent of the cases were among men, the majority of them men who had
sex with men.

Karachi tops in number of HIV/AIDS patients

SECTION: Vol. XXVII No. 577

LENGTH: 370  words


In Sindh province the largest number of HIV(human immunodeficiency virus) /AIDS
(acquired immune deficiency syndrome) patients live in Karachi, as there are
3942 HIV positive and 69 AIDS positive patients in the city, says Dr Muhammad
Munawar Khan, BCC Coordinator, Sindh AIDS Control Program (SACP).

He said Larkana stands second with 354 HIV and 3 AIDS patients. In Hyderabad the
number of registered HIV positive people is 58, while there are 3 AIDS patients.
In Dadu there are 17 HIV and 2 AIDS patients. In Mirpurkhas there are 11 HIV
positive and one AIDS patient. In Sanghar and Sukkur the number of HIV patients
is 96 and 66, respectively, while there is no AIDS patient in these districts.

He said 16 people died of AIDS in Sindh province during last three months, while
326 news AIDS/HIV patients were registered during the same period. They include
304 men, 104 women, 2 girls and one boy.

Dr Khan said during last three months no new AIDS patient was registered in
Sindh. Referring the data of registered AIDS patients with SACP, he said there
are 194 males, one boy, 30 women and one girl AIDS positive people in Sindh
province.

Dr Khan said Sindh AIDS Control Program is running 46 HIV/AIDS clinics in
government district and Taluka hospitals of the province. He said if any patient
is screened positive, he is referred to the central referral lab of the Sindh
AIDS Control Program at Civil Hospital Karachi for further costly tests. He
said; however, all these tests are performed free of cost, and registered HIV/
AIDS patients given free of cost medical care facilities including medicines.

He said in past the very name of HIV/AIDS was a taboo but now this mindset has
changed and people are visiting their clinics for HIV/AIDS screening. He said in
Sindh province unsafe blood transfusion and use of shared injections amongst
drug addicts is the major cause of HIV/AIDS; however, the activities of
professional sex workers including transgender people, locally called Hejras, is
another cause of these infections.

He said unclean tools of dentists, unhygienic surgical procedures and use of
shared razor blades in barber shops are also responsible for HIV/AIDS infection
and people must avoid them at all costs.

ANALOGUE and digital hearing aids look similar but while traditional devices
amplify electronic signals digital appliances can be precisely tuned to
individual hearing loss via a tiny computer.

Behind-the-ear (BTE) hearing aids BTE aids have an earmould that fits inside the
ear while the rest sits behind it. Some models have twin microphones which let
you switch from all round sound to a more directional setting.

BTE hearing aids with 'open ear fitting' have a small soft earpiece at the tip
of the tubing. This can be less noticeable than an earmould but is suitable only
when hearing loss is mild or moderate.

Receiver in-the-ear (RITE) hearing aids RITE or loudspeaker in-the-ear aids are
often smaller than BTE aids as part of the device sits inside the ear. They can
be easier to put in than an earmould.

There are different RITE aids depending on hearing loss and, where deafness is
severe, a device where the receiver sits in an earmould may be necessary.

RITE-style aids are not currently available through the NHS.

In-the-ear (ITE) hearing aids These fit wholly into the ear. The working parts
are either in a small compartment clipped to the earmould or inside the moulded
section. ITE aids tend to need repairing more frequently than BTE appliances.

Completely in-the-canal (CIC) hearing aids These are smaller than ITE aids and
so are less visible. They are unlikely to be suitable for those with severe
hearing loss or who suffer from frequent ear infections.

Body-worn hearing aids A small box clips to the clothes or goes inside the
pocket and connects by a lead to an earphone. The controls can be less fiddly
than those on smaller aids.

Some body-worn aids are very powerful.

Bone conduction hearing aids These devices are for people with conductive
hearing loss or for those who have difficulty wearing conventional hearing aids.
These aids deliver sound through the skull via vibrations.

CROS/BiCROS hearing aids These are for people with hearing in one ear only.

CROS hearing aids pick up sound from the side with no hearing and feed it to the
ear with normal or near normal hearing.

BiCROS aids are very similar but are made for people with no useful hearing in
one ear and with some hearing loss in the other.

China: Wen Jiabao encourages HIV/AIDS sufferers to live with hope

LENGTH: 642 words


Text of report in English by official Chinese news agency Xinhua (New China News
Agency)

[Xinhua "China Focus": "Premier Wen Encourages HIV/AIDS Sufferers To Live With
hope"]

BEIJING, Dec. 1 (Xinhua) - Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao encouraged HIV/AIDS
sufferers to live on with hope and confidence during his visit to a Beijing
hospital on the World AIDS Day, which falls on Tuesday.

At the Beijing Home of Red Ribbon in Ditan Hospital, Wen and Vice-Premier Li
Keqiang visited two AIDS patients and medical volunteers, experts.

Since China reported its first AIDS case in 1985, the world's most populous
nation had recorded 319,877 HIV/AIDS cases and 49,845 deaths by October,
according to the Ministry of Health.

Yet, the statistics only include cases reported by medical facilities. The
ministry and the UNAIDS estimate that China will have 560,000 to 920,000 living
HIV carriers, with 97,000 to 112,000 AIDS patients by the end of 2009.

Over the past six consecutive years, Premier Wen inspected HIV/AIDS prevention
and treatment work every year and even invited orphans whose parents died of
AIDS to tour Zhongnanhai, a compound of buildings for the central authorities in
the heart of Beijing.

At the Beijing Home of Red Ribbon on Tuesday, Wen put on a red ribbon, the
awareness symbol for the fight against AIDS, and shook hands with two HIV
carriers, who are also instructors there.

Wen said that attention should be paid to AIDS prevention not only on the the
World AIDS Day, but also in daily life and work.

Lao Zhao, an HIV sufferer, told Premier Wen that he was diagnosed HIV positive
in 2003 and has received medical treatment thanks to the country's policy of
"four frees, one care".

Since the end of 2003, the Chinese government has carried out the policy "four
frees, one care" including free blood tests for those with HIV, free education
for orphans of AIDS patients and free consultation, screening tests and
antiretroviral therapy for pregnant women.

Premier Wen told Lao Zhao that the AIDS patients should keep an optimistic mood,
self-confidence and persist in taking the anti-AIDS medicine and therapy.

Wen also encouraged Lao Zhao and other AIDS patients to provide psychological
counselling for their wardmates and exchange their therapy experience for mutual
encouragement.

"The efforts of the volunteers and the fellow patients will reduce psychological
pressure of HIV/AIDS sufferers and help them establish self-confidence so as to
live on with optimistic attitude and fight against the disease," Wen said.

The government's "four frees, one care" policy is meant to arouse attention to
the AIDS patients and instead of discriminating against them, create an
atmosphere that cares about AIDS patients, Wen said.

The Premier also encouraged the volunteers working at the Beijing Home of Red
Ribbon to provide more help to the AIDS patients with heart and soul.

In meeting with medical staff and HIV researchers, Premier Wen said that the
AIDS is a serious health issue as well as a social issue that the world is
facing.

Wen pointed out five measures to prevent and control the disease.

First, beeing up the prevention knowledge spread among the people and improve
medical treatment service.

Second, strengthening AIDS/HIV epidemic monitoring work to accurately learn
about the situation..

Third, further implementing the "four frees, one care" policy to ensure all HIV
carriers and AIDS patients are cared for and respected.

Fourth, enlarging the coverage of social interference concerning the disease.

Fifth, beefing up research work to improve prevention and treatment
capabilities.

Chinese President Hu Jintao pledged mobilizing the whole society to improve
AIDS/HIV control, when speaking to a gathering of AIDS prevention volunteers on
Monday, a day before the 22nd World AIDS Day.

First aid box should allow for prompt treatment

SECTION: WORKPLACE; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 456 words


What should the first aid box in the workplace contain?

This is always a difficult topic. Anyone who is a mother will have a "first aid
box" that will make any pharmacy in Timbuktu proud.

As a doctor, my emergency bag is vastly different from most people's "first aid
box".

So what should a first aid box in the workplace contain?

And what use is a first aid box if |you do not have staff trained to |use it?

The regulation is specific, stating that "an employer shall take all reasonable
steps that are necessary under the circumstances to ensure that persons at work
receive prompt first aid treatment in case of injury or emergency".

In other words, there should be staff trained in first aid to provide "prompt
first aid treatment". Therefore, employers are obliged to provide training in
first aid for staff by an accredited organisation.

When a company has trained first aid staff, a first aid box becomes an asset.
First aid boxes must be provided where there are more than five employees at a
workplace.

These first aid boxes must be easily available and accessible in case of an
emergency. Each industry has different risks and the number of first aid boxes
required depends on the type of injury foreseen, as well as the total number |of
employees.

I recommend that a company that specialises in this field assess the risk and
advise on this subject.

The minimum contents for a first aid box is listed in the Annexure at the back
of the General Administrative Regulations, Government Notice R.2245 of August 7,
1992.

A first aid box may not have any medication, such as painkillers, in it.

A first aider may not administer medicine to a patient, as they are not
qualified to do so.

As with most things in the workplace, contents in first aid boxes often
disappear. Because of this, many employers lock the first aid box.

This is not permitted, as that means the contents are no longer available and
accessible. The best option is to invest in safety tags that are numbered and
can be removed easily in case |of emergency.

This then must be followed up by regular inspections of the first aid boxes to
ensure that they contain the minimum prescribed contents and that expired
products are discarded and replaced immediately.

A first aid register for the purpose of recording all incidents where first aid
had to be provided must be kept in or near the first aid box, along with a list
of the names of certified first aiders in the company.

Contrary to what most people believe, the first aid box is not a fix for all
medical ailments in the company; it contains specific items as required by law
to treat emergencies.

China's grassroots organizations recognized for AIDS care

LENGTH: 1237 words


Text of report in English by official Chinese news agency Xinhua (New China News
Agency)

Beijing, 3 December: When Thomas Cai was counselling HIV/AIDS patients at
Guangzhou No 8 Hospital in 2001, he founded AIDS Care China, never dreaming it
would expand to four provinces with 32 full-time staff covering 2,500 patients
in five years. Based in Guangzhou, AIDS Care China operates care centres near
hospitals and clinics offering HIV/AIDS patients and their families free
accommodation and dining services, and counselling. The organization also offers
direct employment to those living with HIV/AIDS and provides training and
education, enabling them to participate in AIDS prevention and awareness
programmes.

"AIDS Care China promotes the concept that people living with HIV/AIDS should
not isolate themselves in fear of being pitied," says Cai, director of AIDS Care
China. "Rather, they should face the wider realities and embrace society, and
mobilize more resources to fight AIDS."

On the World AIDS Day this year, the organization received the Red Ribbon Award
and a 5,000-US-dollar grant from the United Nations for its crucial
community-based approach to creating a dialogue between the government health
authorities and people living with HIV/AIDS. It was the first time a Chinese
non-governmental organization had received such high-profile global recognition
for HIV/AIDS care.

"The Red Ribbon Award not only recognizes this outstanding group, but it also
recognizes the crucial role communities can play with local authorities at a
crucial time for the HIV/AIDS epidemic in China," said Khalid Malik, the United
Nations Development Programme (UNDP) representative in China, at the award
ceremony on 1 December in Beijing.

Indeed, China has seen a more active grassroots organizations in HIV/AIDS
prevention and care in recent years. Over 50 registered non-governmental
organizations working nationwide have HIV/AIDS programmes and dozens of
volunteer groups dedicated to AIDS care in community. "The government has
recognized the active and important role of grassroots organizations in HIV/AIDS
prevention and control," said Chen Xiaohong, vice-minister of health.
"Government efforts alone are not enough if China is to prevent the further
spread of HIV/AIDS."

Figures from the Health Ministry show the number of recorded HIV/AIDS cases rose
by almost 30 per cent to 183,733 in the first 10 months of this year, from
144,089 cases at the end of last year. Health experts say actual cases are
likely to be more and both the government and the World Health Organization
(WHO) estimated 650,000 Chinese were living with HIV/AIDS at the end of 2005.
"Grassroots organizations should play a more important role, especially in the
advocacy awareness campaign, care and treatment in the community," said Dr Henk
Bekedam, WHO representative in China.

Care and prevention in the community should begin with preparation of the
community by providing HIV/AIDS education and information so people know about
and understand the disease, says Cai. "This helps to create acceptance in the
community of HIV/AIDS patients and keeps their needs in mind when the community
and healthcare system work as a team in planning and solving HIV/AIDS problems,"
he says.

Tang Zhou, deputy director at Nanning No 4 Hospital in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region, where AIDS Care China has its care centre, says: "Without their help, it
is hard to imagine how we could manage HIV/AIDS patients effectively with
limited medical staff." She says 1,049 HIV/AIDS patients are being treated at
the hospital by just six doctors and 12 nurses. "As a result, we spend much
energy on medical treatment, but have no time for psychological counselling and
support."

The "Red Ribbon Centre" run by AIDS Care China in the hospital serves as a venue
for peer counselling services, community gatherings and training as well as
medical treatment. The centre also informs patients in advance of medical
appointments with software being developed by AIDS Care China that can
containing confidential contact information and medical records so the centre
can provide more individual attention to each person and assist rural patients
to arrange transport to go to the hospital.

AIDS Care China provides prevention, awareness and treatment information and
hope through its bi-monthly "AIDS Bulletin" newsletter, which has a distribution
of 3,000, its website (http://www.aidscarechina.org), which receives more than
5,000 hits a day, and a telephone hotline. They also make and distribute red
envelopes (hongbao), traditionally used to give gifts of money for Chinese New
Year, to migrant workers and university students. Each packet contains a condom,
a red ribbon and a booklet about HIV prevention.

"Grassroots organizations can bridge the gap between the patients and society.
We give care and understanding to sufferers, who need more than medical
treatment, and reduce the public stigma," says Cai.

As the war on AIDS has never been easy, so has the growth of grassroots
organizations in China. Cai recalls how residents drove him out of one
neighbourhood after his shelter for people who had contracted the disease
through drug-taking was disclosed by the media in 2002. "Sometimes we joke that
our organization is like a wild mushroom," he says. "Many people might think all
wild mushrooms are poisonous, and yes, some could be, but actually, some are
also very beneficial."

In 2003, AIDS Care China received funding from UNDP, its first official funding.
AIDS Care China now has financial and technical support from the UNDP, UNAIDS,
the International AIDS Alliance, Treat Asia, the Ford Foundation, the Barry and
Martin Foundation among others, with total donations of 1.4m yuan (175,000 US
dollars) in 2005.

AIDS Care China is working with the UNDP to support the socio-economic
empowerment of women living with HIV/AIDS through a micro-enterprise scheme in
Yunnan and Guangdong provinces with funding of 40,000 US dollars. The aim of
this project is to encourage and support women living with HIV/AIDS groups to
set up and run their own small businesses. Profits from the businesses are
channelled back into the group to fund support activities, reducing donor
dependency and increasing sustainability.

"AIDS Care China's success lies in the strong support from partnerships with
local nurses and doctors, tireless volunteers, government and private sectors,
which makes me believe that the campaign against HIV/AIDS is too formidable to
be fought alone," says Cai.

Since 2002, the government has allocated 20m yuan (2.5m US dollars) for 231
projects by non-governmental bodies and communities in 150 counties of 30
provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities. The Global Fund to Fight
against AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria has given 450,000 US dollars to 72
Chinese non-governmental organizations. About 43 per cent of the 29m US dollars
the Global Fund has pledged to China in the latest funding will support
non-government programmes.

"The government and NGOs should cooperate like the two wheels of a car and the
two wings of a bird. In HIV/AIDS prevention, grassroots organizations would play
an even greater role," said Zhang Weiqing, head of the National Population and
Family Planning Commission of China (NPFPC), at the 16th International AIDS
Conference in Toronto in August this year.

Brazil's grass-roots fight against AIDS

BYLINE: Reese Erlich

SECTION: PERSPECTIVE; Pg. 1P

LENGTH: 1006 words

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil


At first, Cleidejane Araujo didn't want to become a prostitute. But her
philandering husband had given her AIDS, and she was desperate to support her
two young children. So she reluctantly became a streetwalker in a working-class
area just outside Rio.

The doctors told her she was HIV-positive in the early 1990s, but she didn't
understand the diagnosis. Because she didn't have any symptoms, she didn't seek
treatment. Araujo says she doesn't know how many men she may have infected.

In 1996, she says, "I got all the diseases associated with HIV: tuberculosis,
herpes and pneumonia. They all came together at once."

Araujo almost died. She credits the medical staff at the Rio federal hospital
for saving her life and helping her become an AIDS activist. Today, she heads a
small nonprofit, HIV Vida, that educates poor people about AIDS prevention and
treatment.

Araujo's experiences paralleled those of many Brazilians until the mid 1990s.
AIDS was largely ignored by the government, and antiretroviral drugs were
expensive and hard to obtain. Under pressure from AIDS groups, the government
changed its policies and now provides free treatment and a full regimen of
medications to anyone who is HIV-positive.

These days, Brazilians receive better AIDS treatment than some people in the
United States, according to John Iverson, co-founder of the AIDS group ACT-UP in
Oakland and Berkeley, Calif. In some states, patients must exhibit AIDS symptoms
before they qualify for free care. As of September, 2,187 people in nine states
were qualified to receive free drugs but were on waiting lists because of a lack
of government financing.

"In Brazil, the treatment is more universal than it is in the United States,
where there are waiting lists for AIDS drug-assistance programs," says Iverson.

AIDS activists in the United States and Brazil have been exchanging information
and supporting one another's struggles to improve treatment in both countries,
he says.

In Brazil in the 1980s, as in the United States, AIDS was considered a "gay
plague," says Veriano Terto, executive director of the Brazilian
Interdisciplinary AIDS Association, or ABIA. But then Herbet de Souza, a
well-known intellectual better known as Betinho, contracted AIDS through a blood
transfusion. His two brothers, also hemophiliacs, contracted AIDS. "When Betinho
declared himself as HIV-positive, that was very important to change the
visibility of AIDS in the country," says Terto.

Betinho formed ABIA, which became one of the earliest advocacy groups. Gays and
progressive groups pressured the government to provide free AIDS drugs. Brazil
was ruled by the military from 1964-85, so the AIDS movement joined with
prodemocracy advocates. "We demanded democracy, social and political
participation in governmental decisions," says Terto.

In the 1990s, international experts told Brazilian doctors that little could be
done for their hundreds of thousands of AIDS patients. In 1992, the World Bank
wrote that AIDS cases in Brazil could reach 1.2-million by 2000. But the
combination of free health care, free medications and grass-roots prevention
campaigns defied those predictions. Since 1996, the government has reduced AIDS
mortality rates by half and reduced hospitalization for AIDS by 80 percent.

Dr. Mauro Schecter, a professor and AIDS expert at the Federal University of Rio
de Janeiro, says governments in many other developing countries have failed in
the fight against AIDS. "Our government was sensible enough to yield to the
grass-roots pressure," he says.

In Brazil today, nonprofit groups take the AIDS prevention message to schools,
youth hangouts and streets where sex workers ply their trade. Former prostitute
Araujo says female sex workers take a tough line about safe sex. "Some men want
to pay more not to wear condoms," she says, but the women say "either use
condoms or no sex." Araujo admits that transvestite sex workers present a more
difficult problem. Transvestites work the same streets as female prostitutes,
but they are less likely to use condoms, according to Araujo.

The transvestite sex workers tend to think "if I get it, I'll be treated," she
says. "They don't realize all the side effects of the drugs and treatment."

The Brazilian Ministry of Health constantly struggles to pay for AIDS
medications. Two-thirds of its AIDS budget is spent on just three drugs
manufactured by Merck, Abbott Laboratories and Gilead Sciences. Brazilian health
ministry officials have demanded that the drug companies lower their prices for
AIDS drugs. Under international law, Brazil can declare a health emergency and
manufacture the drugs as generics, paying a minimal royalty to the patent
holder.

The drug companies and the Bush administration strongly oppose such a move,
however, saying it would violate the drug companies' intellectual property
rights. The Bush administration has threatened trade sanctions should Brazil
issue such compulsory licenses.

After tough bargaining that ended in early October, Abbott Labs agreed to reduce
by nearly half the price of its AIDS drug Kaletra. Negotiations continue with
the other two companies.

American activists, following the Brazilian example, say the U.S. government
should also demand lower prices for AIDS drugs and then distribute them free.
AIDS hits U.S. minority communities particularly hard. In 2003, of the 406,000
Americans living with AIDS, 20 percent were Latino and 42 percent were
African-American.

Getting antiretroviral drugs "is a civil right," says Anne Christine d'Adesky,
executive director of the group AIDS, Medicine and Miracles. "Brazil has opened
the eyes of the world to the issue of access to medicine."

Ironically, AIDS activists in Brazil worry that their government receives too
much praise for its programs. Brazil must improve its health care system and
needs ongoing international aid, they say.

"We wouldn't say Brazil produced a model," says ABIA's Terto. "It has an
interesting experience with some good results because of the universal
distribution of antiretrovirals."

Group quits over AIDS Walk proceeds;
Says grants should be for nonprofit aid

BYLINE: LISA KERNEK STAFF WRITER

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 856 words


An argument over how to spend proceeds from Springfield's annual AIDS Walk has
prompted some anti-AIDS crusaders to quit the 10-year-old fund-raiser.

The rift was aired this month in the pages of the Prairie Flame, a
Springfield-based monthly newspaper that covers the gay community and has been a
recipient of AIDS Walk grants. Representatives of the Phoenix Center quit the
AIDS Walk steering committee in protest of a long-standing policy that allows
some AIDS Walk grants to be given to for-profit organizations - and the Prairie
Flame is the only for-profit group ever to have received the grants.

The withdrawal led to a front-page article in the Prairie Flame accusing the
Phoenix Center of having a vendetta against the newspaper - which the Phoenix
Center denies - and an editorial likening the Phoenix Center to a "malignant
growth."

The Phoenix Center promotes AIDS education among youth.

"It seemed to upset the Phoenix Center that, as a for-profit organization, I
should be able to get grant money," said Buff Carmichael, a state worker who
publishes Prairie Flame in his spare time.

The paper, founded in 1996, turned its first profit - $650 - last year,
Carmichael said.

Phoenix Center executive director Jack Bishop maintains the pullout "has nothing
to do with the name of Prairie Flame."

"It has to do with that a for-profit business received funds from AIDS Walk
Springfield," Bishop said.

Next Step Outreach, which directs AIDS prevention efforts among the
African-American community, also has quit AIDS Walk. Next Step coordinator
Michael Myles said he is fed up with the infighting.

"We're not focusing on the epidemic," said Myles, who has not attended the last
couple of AIDS Walk meetings. "I'd rather not put my energy into bickering."

And Positive Options, Referrals and Alternatives, which provides housing and
social services to people with a history of prostitution, will consider whether
to withdraw from AIDS Walk at its January board meeting, executive director Lucy
Breitung said.

"The board is taking an extremely neutral position," Breitung said.

Penny McConnell, an individual who volunteered for the steering committee, also
withdrew from AIDS Walk, but declined an interview.

Since the launch of AIDS Walk Springfield in 1994, the main requirement for
grant eligibility has been that the money be spent on promoting AIDS awareness
and prevention. Prairie Flame meets that requirement by educating readers about
AIDS. Volunteering to help plan the walk also is a requirement for receiving a
grant. A group of volunteers independent of the steering committee decides how
the grants are allocated.

In October, representatives of the Phoenix Center led an effort to change the
grant rules to restrict AIDS Walk grants to nonprofit groups, but the measure
failed by one vote. A PORA employee at the meeting was among those who voted to
restrict grant eligibility to nonprofit groups.

The Phoenix Center has since shifted its energies to Springfield Organizations
Fighting Against AIDS, a newly formed coalition of groups working year-round to
raise money for AIDS causes.

"Because we have pulled our efforts, it doesn't mean we don't wish AIDS Walk
Springfield well," the Phoenix Center's Bishop said.

Groups applying for AIDS Walk funding have been competing for a shrinking pool
of money, anyway. The event raised $35,000 its first year, but the amount sank
to only about $5,000 this year.

Prairie Flame received a $1,200 grant from the proceeds of this year's AIDS
Walk, held in May. The money was earmarked for an advice column, "Love, Danny,"
by Danny Gale, a New York free-lance writer with AIDS.

"The column's devoted to the cause," said Floyd Perkins, an attorney who is
chairman of the state attorney general's Charitable Trusts Bureau in Chicago. "I
would not consider that problematic."

AIDS Walk is organized as a charitable trust.

Meanwhile, "SARA Center had requested funding and they didn't receive it, and
that was a concern of the Phoenix Center," Bishop said.

The nonprofit Springfield AIDS Resource Association (SARA) Center provides
residential care for HIV-infected people and emphasizes AIDS prevention. Bishop
believed the SARA Center deserved an AIDS Walk grant.

SARA Center's application for $6,000 was denied because the application was not
specific enough about how the money would be spent and didn't meet the event's
criteria, according to Matt Costa, who was chairman of the May AIDS Walk.

SARA Center will continue to support AIDS Walk, said Katie Kern, the agency's
HIV testing and outreach coordinator.

"When you live in a community where funding can sometimes be competitive, stuff
like this will happen," Kern said.

Meanwhile, new volunteers showed up at this month's meeting of the AIDS Walk
steering committee. Organizers said next spring's 10th anniversary walk will go
forward despite the recent departures.

"After they all stomped their feet and walked out the door, we sort of had a
regrouping," said the Prairie Flame's Carmichael. "I think we're going to have
the best AIDS Walk we've ever had."

Corruption should not be a reason to deny aid
A review of Ireland's aid programme was launched this week. Maura Leen looks at
how the money can best be spent

SECTION: CITY EDITION; OPINION AND ANALYSIS; Pg. 14

LENGTH: 1064 words


The publication of the Ireland Aid Review could not come at a more critical
time. An international coalition to fight terror has been formed, yet a global
coalition to fight the terror that is hunger and poverty has not materialised.

Despite the commitment in 1970 by the world's richest countries to raise aid
levels to the UN target of 0.7 per cent of Gross National Product, aid flows
represent only 0.22 per cent of the GNP of OECD member countries - the lowest
level in a decade.

Irish aid as a share of GNP has gone in the opposite direction, however: from
the low level of 0.16 per cent in 1992, it is set to reach 0.45 per cent this
year and hit the UN's 0.7 per cent target by 2007.

Ireland, more than most countries, knows the value of overseas aid, a point
emphasised by Bertie Ahern in his speech to the first European Union-Africa
heads of state summit in April 2000 when he noted that "support from the EU
through its regional development and cohesion funds played a role in our current
economic success".

However, the limited aid flows from developed countries have not been focused on
the world's poorest countries. Between 1990 and 1998, aid per capita to the
poorest region in the world, sub-Saharan Africa, fell from $ 32 to $ 19. This
happened before the widely cited Assessing Aid report, published by the World
Bank in 1998, pointed out the importance that aid be targeted at high
poverty-good policy environments.

While Africa is well known for its high poverty, it is also a continent with
high levels of corruption. Yet Ireland Aid has, since its inception, prioritised
its resource allocation towards Africa. The review report recommends the
continuation of this focus on sub-Saharan Africa along with some expansion in
other parts of the world. It also endorses Ireland's commitment to investing its
aid resources in health, education and other key areas, most notably HIV/AIDS,
an issue that cuts across all aid programmes.

The Ireland Aid Review makes many sensible recommendations on managing this
growth. These include more staffing, a greater research capacity and greater
operational flexibility in the management of the programme. Stronger policies
and research capacity will assist Ireland Aid and the Minister in
contextualising their efforts to better ensure that aid allocations are not
undermined by financial or trade policies at odds with the objective of poverty
reduction.

The core challenge in all this is to maximise the effectiveness of aid in a
world where 1.2 billion people live on less than a dollar a day. The harsh
reality is that some poor countries are more capable of benefiting from aid than
others. Yet the challenge lies in building up the institutional capacity of
those countries with weak governance - and not only in picking "winners" or
helping those who are best able to help themselves. At the same time, Ireland
Aid and non-governmental organisations must not ignore the problems of fragile
states. Somalia, where Ireland Aid has supported Tr caire's work, is a stark
example of a country with no national government.

The report recognises that the thorny issue of governance - highlighted this
week in regard to Uganda - involves all areas of the aid programme. Corruption
should not be used as a reason to deny aid resources. Instead, corruption should
be tackled head on as part of a broader strategy of poverty reduction which
should involve the empowerment of poor people and the creation of efficient and
effective government.

In sub-Saharan Africa, where Ireland's bilateral aid programme will remain
concentrated, the foundations for progress are being laid. Structural reforms,
supported by aid, continue to be pursued in many countries, including Ethiopia,
Mozambique, Tanzania and Uganda.

The report also recognises the need for new and more strategic partnerships
between Ireland Aid and civil society, both at home with Irish NGOs and
missionaries and also at field level with local participation as well as Irish
personnel. There are many areas where a well-constructed division of labour
between Ireland Aid and NGOs would be desirable.

The commitment of Ireland Aid to democratisation programmes and the defence of
human rights is a case in point. Building active citizenship in developing
countries is undoubtedly one of the best bulwarks against despotism and
oppression. This is something NGOs, with their independence from governments,
have taken up. Ireland Aid also has a role to play here and has enthusiastically
contributed to voter education and election monitoring in many countries.

And aid is not the only channel for this: Ireland has a key voice at EU level
and, for the rest of this year, on the UN Security Council.

The report recommends that Ireland Aid develop more strategic partnerships with
key UN agencies - and this has been echoed by the Minister of State with
responsibility for overseas development, Ms Liz O'Donnell. Ireland Aid should
also explore opportunities to strengthen the role of the UN as a convenor and
facilitator of policy dialogue and consensus building on global economic,
financial and development issues. In particular, the UN and its specialised
institutions should play an enhanced role in identifying emerging development
issues and policy gaps.

The omens are good for the long-term impact of the Ireland Aid programme. It has
gained much experience in what makes for good aid practice. It is well regarded
by the international aid community and by the governments and peoples of the
countries it works with in the developing world. Relationships between the
official programme and the Irish NGOs are generally strong, though many NGOs
would like more dialogue with Ireland Aid on policy and strategic issues,
something promised in this report.

Ireland Aid requires a rapid expansion and upgrade of its management structures,
and this is now in preparation. The programme faces complex questions on
strategy and direction. These questions are being confronted.

And it is important to remember that Ireland, in moving towards the UN aid
target, is being held up by its developing country partners as an exemplar to
others.

This report holds out the promise that Ireland Aid will be at the leading edge,
both in terms of the quantity and the quality of its programmes.

JOIN ME IN RENEWING OUR COMMITMENT TO LEGAL AID

BYLINE: JUSTICE SIDNEY B. LINDEN

SECTION: FORUM; Pg. A11

LENGTH: 769 words


The fundamental principle of legal aid is to promote equal access to justice by
identifying and meeting the legal needs of low-income Ontarians.

The current plan of legal aid services has advanced this principle well for more
than 30 years. Despite recent cuts that were implemented to operate within a
capped budget, the commitment of legal aid professionals remained steadfast and,
in fact, proved critical to the continuation of legal aid services in this
province.

As members of a democratic society, we renewed the commitment to legal aid when
Legal Aid Ontario became fully operational on April 1 as an arms-length agency
to administer legal aid services in Ontario. My role as chair of the
transitional board of Legal Aid Ontario offered me an exciting opportunity to
advocate on behalf of legal aid and to participate in developing policy and
strategic planning. Now, we've got our financial house in order, services are
expanding, and pilot projects are underway throughout Ontario.

It's important that legal aid services be more accessible to people who need
them. Legal Aid Ontario also has a responsibility to educate and inform -- an
objective this article is intended to serve.

There is a wide range of legal aid services.

If your legal situation is urgent and serious and you have little or no money
left after you pay for necessities like food and housing, you may be eligible
for legal aid. The certificate program is the basis of legal aid. If you are
eligible, you can take your legal aid certificate to a lawyer of your choice.

Community legal clinics, duty counsel in the courtroom and The Advice Lawyer --
a program often available in public libraries and community centres -- also play
a role in providing access to justice. Check your phone book's white pages under
Legal Aid for the legal aid office nearest you.

In Hamilton, we will be expanding the role of duty counsel in the courtroom this
year. Full-time staff duty counsel will provide a broader service to family law
clients who qualify for legal aid but whose cases are not covered by
certificates. Duty counsel will also help draft documents and provided extended
advice and assistance.

ROAD MAP

The creation of Legal Aid Ontario is widely regarded as the culmination of the
first comprehensive review of the legal aid plan in Ontario and an extensive and
thorough consultation process. I consider the 1997 legal aid review -- conducted
by Professor John McCamus, former dean of Osgoode Hall Law School -- as the road
map for Legal Aid Ontario. His report indicates where we've been, where we are
now and where we're headed.

I believe we can build on the strengths of the system by renewing the commitment
to legal aid in several ways. We must identify and assess the needs of those who
are unable to afford legal services. It's a matter of providing service in
different ways and ensuring more people get better services.

The provision of legal aid services must be of consistently high quality across
Ontario. How we deliver these services should be adapted to context -- the legal
context in which services are required as well the geographic context where they
must be provided. In a province as large as Ontario with its mix of urban, rural
and remote communities, people interact with the legal system in ways that vary
from region to region.

ACCOUNTABILITY

I think we have an appropriate accountability framework in place to demonstrate
that legal services can be provided in a cost-effective manner. Legal Aid
Ontario has a guaranteed budget of $230 million for each of the next three
years. This gives us the opportunity to begin our work within a stable funding
platform and to take advantage of a three-year planning cycle.

My involvement with legal aid predates the start of the plan in 1967.

TREATED EQUALLY

Over the last 30 years -- as a pro bono lawyer, defence counsel providing legal
aid services, member of legal aid's governing body and as a judge -- I have seen
how important it is that people are treated equally by the justice system. And
in 1987 I helped establish Canada's first prepaid Legal Services Plan on behalf
of the Canadian Auto Workers and the auto firms.

I do not view legal aid as exclusively a social program. I consider it a
fundamental, essential part of the justice system. Ontarians can be proud of the
role that legal aid has played in our history. And I invite you to join with me
in renewing the commitment to legal aid.

Justice Sidney B. Linden is chair of the transitional board of Legal Aid
Ontario. He is on leave from the Ontario Court of Justice.

Impact of AIDS at the workplace

BYLINE: By Ambi Kun; Hasniza Mohd Zaferi

SECTION: Appointments; Pg. 9

LENGTH: 1613 words


THE business impact of AIDS is now visible in workplaces in many parts of
the world, and is a major worry for managers. AIDS takes its toll in the
workplace in a number of ways; the loss of experienced personnel,
absenteeism as a result of AIDS-related illness to care for others and to
attend funerals, and increased recruitment and training costs.

In many developing regions, finding qualified top-level management and
skilled workers to replace those who die or can no longer work can be
extremely difficult. Productivity suffers during the time it takes to
replace workers, particularly skilled ones. Also, it often takes weeks for
new employees to become as productive as those whom they have replaced.

Other costs to the developing regions include increased healthcare
expenditure (including medical and insurance), death benefit and pension
payments.

The impact of AIDS in the Malaysian work-place is uncertain, but judging
from the increasing number of recorded cases, the problems will soon
surface here. Ministry of Health statistics in July show that the
cumulative number of reported HIV cases was 26,549. On average, the number
increases by 300 every month. Out of this, 1,804 have developed AIDS and
1,425 have died.

HIV/AIDS is not merely a health issue. HIV/AIDS can adversely affect the
economy, particularly those of developing nations in the following ways:

HIV/AIDS infection reduces the supply of labour. It affects mostly
youths and adults in the most productive periods of their lives. In a
developing country, the average lifespan of a person with HIV/AIDS is
shorter than in a developed nation because of fewer opportunities for
treatment. Families lose breadwinners and women and children are forced to
work. Diseases caused by AIDS also increase the infant mortality rate;

The more likely impact on the labour force is a decline in quality.
HIV/AIDS reduces the number of skilled and expensively trained workers,
which delays economic development. Also families with a HIV/AIDS patient
will spend less on education; and

Domestic savings may decline as the public sector uses more funds to
cope with the impact of the epidemic.

Thus, employers need to implement proper and effective AIDS programmes
in the workplace. HIV/AIDS can adversely affect the productivity level of
an organisation in the following ways:

Loss of experienced and talented staff;

Loss of productive time as co-workers grieve the loss of colleagues,
family members and friends;

Increased rate of absenteeism and training costs in finding
replacements for personnel who have passed away or left the workforce due
to AIDS-related illness;

Increased healthcare, medical and insurance costs, and death benefits;
and

Unwarranted fear and ignorance of the disease would disrupt work and
productivity at a time when the competitive global marketplace demands
nothing less than total efficiency and outstanding performance.

In order to devise a suitable programme for Malaysian companies, a
number of factors have to be taken into consideration, including the
diverse cultures of the workforce, people's perception of HIV/AIDS, level
of knowledge and awareness about AIDS and religious beliefs of the
employees.

Effective workplace programmes can be introduced at a fraction of the
current costs of AIDS to business. Companies should not wait for the
Government or the health sector to take action. Programmes can be
introduced now which will vary according to the size of the company, its
resources, structures and employee culture.

Objective of workplace AIDS programme
IT is important to establish objectives for a work-place AIDS programme
which could consist of the following:

To minimise workplace disruption and lost productivity. Employees who
know the facts about HIV infection and AIDS are less likely to react
negatively to a co-worker's illness, whether that illness is actual or
supposed;

To reduce healthcare costs for employees by helping to prevent new
infections. By establishing open communication about AIDS, employers can
encourage employees already infected to seek early care and treatment,
which reduces hospitalisation and lowers costs significantly over the
course of their illness;

To demonstrate clear concern for the wellness of employees and their
families;

To improve the reliability of the medical and human resources
departments with up-to-date sources of information. This will allow the
company to learn more about the impact of AIDS in the workplace and help
manage it more effectively;

To ensure that employees infected with or affected by HIV receive
appropriate counselling, medical and social support through company
resources. Company-provided benefits and programmes have an important role
in preserving the dignity of these employees by helping them maintain
normal, productive lives for as long as possible.

The recommended components of an AIDS programme are as follows:

A policy statement should be drafted and disseminated. It should be
informative and educational so as to provide guidance for employees.

A comprehensive policy statement could read: "The company will not
discriminate against employees living with or affected by HIV or AIDS. The
company will treat HIV infection and AIDS the same as other illnesses in
terms of benefits and leave.

"Employees living with or affected by HIV/AIDS will be treated with
compassion and understanding, as are employees with other disabling
conditions. Co-workers" concerns will be handled in an educational
fashion.

"Supervisors and managers are encouraged to contact the Human Resources
Department for assistance in providing employees with information and
help. Recognising the need for all employees to be accurately informed
about HIV infection and AIDS, the company will make information and
educational materials available.

"Co-workers are expected to continue working relationships with any
employee who has HIV infection or AIDS. Co-workers who refuse to work
with, harass or otherwise discriminate against an employee with HIV
infection or AIDS will be subject to the same disciplinary procedures that
apply to other forms of misconduct.

"Information about an employee's medical condition is private and will
be treated in a confidential manner."

Education and seminar programmes: To conduct these programmes, the
human resources department should appoint a health co-ordinator on a
permanent basis. His or her duties could include educating and enhancing
understanding among employees about various health problems especially
HIV/AIDS and other diseases.

The education should cover topics such as "What is AIDS?", "How is
HIV/AIDS transmitted?", "How is HIV/AIDS not transmitted?" and "How can
HIV transmission be prevented?". It should also cover other issues on AIDS
and illnesses and diseases that employees should know about.

Collaboration with the Malaysian Aids Council and Malaysian Pink
Triangle in arranging the above programmes.

Checking with the human resources department to ensure that known AIDS
victims are not discriminated against in terms of rights and benefits.

A voluntary HIV testing programme could be offered to employees.

The voluntary testing programme should be accompanied by a counselling
programme for staff members and their families. Counselling could focus on
medical, psychological and spiritual aspects.

The counsellor must be always available and approachable.
Confidentiality must be assured. The company could train any member of its
staff in counselling techniques or the services of a consultant could be
offered to the staff.

Adequate funds must be provided. Funds will be necessary to pay for
the voluntary testing; an in-house medical kit, expenses for the education
and seminar programmes and funeral.

Prevention programmes may also include the following:

General first-aid equipment. Employers should ensure that standard
first-aid equipment is available to their staff.

The kit must have waterproof plasters, disposable gloves, sterile
dressings and suture equipment. Employees must be given training in first-
aid.

Condoms may be made available in vending machines at a nominal price.

Employees must be informed about sensible precautions. Such
precautions are helpful in the prevention of a number of other blood-borne
infections such as hepatitis B. They should avoid direct skin contact with
blood. If this occurs, thorough washing with water is recommended.

Whenever assistance to injured persons is given, the wearing of
disposable rubber gloves is recommended. Soiled dressings should be safely
treated and disposed of.

Any spilled blood should be mopped up using household bleach or
detergent. In case of serious bleeding, professional help must be sought.

The employer should ensure continued employment of AIDS victims until
such time as they are declared medically unfit for the job. Where fitness
is impaired by HIV/AIDS-related illness, reasonable alternative work
arrangements should be made as for any other illness.

The effectiveness and sustainability of work-place HIV/AIDS programmes
are enhanced if they are periodically monitored, re-evaluated and updated.
Protection of human rights and the dignity of HIV-infected persons,
including persons with AIDS is essential to the prevention and control of
HIV/AIDS.

Workers with HIV infection who are healthy should be treated the same as
any other worker with an illness.

Ambi and Haniza expect to graduate in the near future from the Mara
Institute of Technology with an MBA.

WHY WE SHOULD DISMANTLE AID

BYLINE: JAMES SHEEHAN

SECTION: EDITORIAL PAGES, Pg. 6A

LENGTH: 890 words


President-elect Bill Clinton has a unique opportunity to set a new direction for
foreign aid in the post-Cold War era.

The Agency for International Development (AID) once served a useful purpose by
strategically disseminating foreign aid in order to contain the spread of
communism. In recent years, however, the absence of a clearly defined mission
has generated a hopelessly tangled bureaucracy. Instead of inventing a new
justification for AID's existence, Mr. Clinton should dismantle the entire
gency.

Following two and a half years of controversy and scandal, Ronald Roskens
resigned his post as head of AID on Nov. 18. During his tenure and even
preceding it, AID has been the target of dozens of investigations and studies by
the General Accounting Office, the Inspector General and even a presidential
commission.

Mr. Roskens himself was the target of an investigation by a congressional
subcommittee for billing the government for personal travel expenses and
accepting honoraria from agency contractors. His departure may symbolize the
swan song of waste and corruption in America's increasingly unpopular foreign
aid program.

Many proposals to modify or redefine AID would salvage its continued existence,
but fail to address the crux of the problem. In the absence of the Cold War, AID
has searched in vain for a new mission to perpetuate its $ 7 billion in annual
expenditures.

It typically has done this by tailoring aid projects to special interests at
home. Powerful lawmakers have attached numerous amendments to foreign aid
legislation benefiting pet projects in their own congressional districts. In
this manner, foreign aid has had no real global purpose except doling out pork
to domestic special interests.

One purpose AID has tried to serve is "export promotion." This scheme involves
offering financial incentives for American corporations to invest abroad.
Theoretically, this should spur increased trade with developing nations.

During the presidential campaign Sen. Al Gore chastised AID for exporting jobs
by "using our tax dollars to subsidize the recruitment of U.S. companies to move
overseas." Mr. Gore's rantings were somewhat misplaced; the issue isn't the
number of job losses. The real error AID made was to assume that bureaucrats
have sufficient knowledge to predict which exports and industries will be
successful. AID generally guessed wrong, and taxpayers were forced to pay for
its mistakes.

One AID program in Mozambique has drawn criticism from Sen. David Boren, D-
Okla., chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Of the $ 68 million in aid
dispensed there, 81 percent of the funds were used to finance the purchase of
foreign-built trucks, tractors, and other equipment.

Sen. Boren is now pushing for AID to revise its programs so that only
American-made equipment may be purchased. But that proposal would not change the
underlying motivations for foreign aid as a vehicle to promote domestic special
interests. Sen. Boren's proposal would simply create many new supplicants to the
federal government with a direct interest in lobbying for increased foreign aid.

Some have also suggested that AID make a transition to protecting the global
environment. This objective will be tempting in an administration in which Al
Gore is a prominent player.

Proponents would have AID support education and training programs to teach
foreign government officials how to implement stringent environmental
regulations. AID has already increased its funding for foreign projects with an
"environmental" rationale by more than $ 150 million over the last five years.
Currently, its funding for such projects has reached $ 400 million a year.

Like other export promotion schemes, this one is susceptible to manipulation by
political forces which have little real concern for the environment. U.S.
manufacturers of environmental control technologies, for instance, have a vested
interest in promoting "environmental" foreign aid.

The main purpose of environmental foreign aid appears to be securing more aid.
One AID environmental project description lists such amorphous objectives as
"policy analysis, formulation, implementation and the evaluation of crucial
environmental problems." Another goal is "institutional strengthening," a veiled
reference to creating bigger bureaucracies that depend on foreign aid.

Proposals to reform foreign aid ignore one of the developing world's most
critical problems: the prevalence of restrictions on trade because of tariff and
non-tariff barriers. Trade protectionism costs developing countries some $ 40
billion every year, according to William Draper, administrator of the United
Nations Development Program. That figure is beginning to approach the level of
foreign aid the developing world receives in total from the industrialized
nations.

Instead of using AID to develop trade in ways approved by the government,
reducing these barriers would be cheaper and more equitable.

All of the excuses for AID's continued existence also are excuses for continued
waste, mismanagement and corruption. If international development is truly a
worthy goal, then this bureaucracy is an illogical candidate to promote it.
Rather than continuing to waste money on ineffective programs, Bill Clinton
should simply abolish AID.

Best "antidote' for AIDS: Knowing you have it

BYLINE: SUSAN BENESCH

SECTION: NATIONAL; Pg. 4A

LENGTH: 1289 words



An outright cure for AIDS is probably still many years away, but enough progress
has been made treating it that AIDS patients are now living much longer than the
first victims of the disease a decade ago.

    And there is hope that the longer they live the better chance they will have
to receive new treatments that will help them live even longer.

    One of the changes is that people such as Magic Johnson are being diagnosed
much earlier, because HIV testing has become more widespread. Early diagnosis
improves one's chances, said Jeffrey Nadler, a University of South Florida (USF)
professor of medicine and expert on AIDS.

    "That's the beauty of Magic Johnson's coming forward," he said.  Nadler
hopes it will persuade others to be tested. "If we start treatment early enough,
we can delay (the advanced stages of AIDS) significantly."

    "There are now long-term survivors," said Paul Arons, the medical director
of Florida's Health and Rehabilitative Services (HRS) AIDS program. "There are
people who are living after the diagnosis of an AIDS-defining condition five
years and longer."

    Johnson is not in that category yet, his doctors say. An "AIDS-defining
condition" is one of a long list of diseases to which HIV-positive people fall
prey because the HIV virus wrecks their bodies' natural defenses. Johnson is
apparently free of such conditions now.

    The virus cripples a person's immune system by killing white blood cells
called T-helper cells. AIDS victims die of one or more of those "opportunistic"
diseases, not of HIV itself.

    That means there are several ways to try to fight AIDS. The first is to
interfere with the HIV virus, so that it cannot wreck the body's immune system.

    The second is to try to decrease the effects of the diseases that most
commonly afflict AIDS patients after HIV has already taken effect.

    "An increasing amount of the research budget of the National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Diseases (which dispenses government money for AIDS
research) is being allocated to research opportunistic infections. There's an
increasing focus on facilitating a better quality of life and a longer life for
people who are HIV-infected," said Arons, the HRS official.

    The most common opportunistic disease in AIDS patients is Pneumocystis
carinii pneumonia (PCP). It is also the disease that kills most AIDS patients.
But several antibiotics, especially one called pentamidine, have helped to fend
off the pneumonia @ According to a study by the San Francisco Department of
Health, this treatment has prolonged many AIDS patients' lives. In the first
four years of the AIDS epidemic, the median survival time for patients with PCP
was only 10 months. It gradually grew to 22 months, according to the survey.

    And a new drug, foscarnet, which was recently approved by the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA), has extended by an average of four months the lives of
AIDS patients who have a serious eye infection called CMV retinitis.

    The best-known AIDS drug, AZT or azidothymidine, works against the AIDS
virus itself, not the opportunistic diseases. AZT prevents the AIDS virus from
multiplying, by inhibiting an enzyme that the virus needs to reproduce its
genetic material.

    But in many AIDS patients AZT works only awhile, and then the virus somehow
manages to thrive. So scientists have worked to develop different drugs that
work on the same principle. Last month, the FDA approved one called DDI
(didanosine or dideoxynosine). Yet another drug, DDC, soon may be approved.

    There is still one more way to fight AIDS, and that is to search for a
vaccine. It is an especially difficult area, even for AIDS research, but at
least 40 different vaccines are being tested in laboratories, and at least seven
have already been tested in clinical trials.

    Most of the vaccines are made from only parts of the HIV virus, and they are
not intended to immunize a person against AIDS. It would be too dangerous to
test a general AIDS virus in uninfected people, because of the chance that some
of them might come down with the disease.

    Also, AIDS researchers are testing for antibodies to the disease. So someone
who had been vaccinated would likely test positive for AIDS.

    Other vaccines can be used to try to stimulate the body's own immune
defenses, even after it has been infected with HIV. These are also being tested.


    It may be possible to be HIV-positive and never get AIDS, but nobody knows.
There are people whose blood samples from the 1970s show HIV infection, and who
are still HIV-positive but have not developed AIDS, Arons said.

    "If you take the average incubation period from the date of infection until
you get AIDS that's 10 years, in gay guys," said Ronnie Massey, director of the
communicable diseases service of the Pinellas County Health Department. "We
really don't know what happens after we're only 10 years into this epidemic,
which  is one incubation period."

    All of this means that AIDS is still fatal as far as anyone knows, since
there are no known cases of people who have been definitively cured of the
disease, but it is possible to live a long time with it, and in relatively good
health for at least part of the time.

    "At this point I'm really talking about extending life span," said Nadler,
the USF professor. "But we're not only talking about letting them live longer
with full-blown AIDS, but preserving their immune function so that they are
reasonably well and able to function."

     Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) experts say there are five
specific stages to the progressive disease:
    1. Acute retroviral syndrome. This lasts a few weeks or a few months after
infection with the virus. Testing is usually negative, even though the body is
already infected. About 40 percent of people develop flu-like symptoms which are
generally not diagnosed at the time, and from which they recover.

    2. Asymptomatic HIV infected stage, or incubation period. No symptoms. Magic
Johnson is probably in this stage. It now lasts an average of 9.7 years.

    3. Early symptomatic HIV disease. This is what used to be called AIDS
-related complex or ARC. The patient's immune system is sufficiently damaged to
cause symptoms like intermittent diarrhea, fevers, swelling of the lymph nodes,
and fatigue. There may be mild symptoms of infections such as vaginitis, thrush
(a yeast infection of the throat), yeast infection of the fingernails, shingles,
or unusual herpes infection of the mouth. This stage typically lasts two to five
years.

    4. Late symptomatic HIV disease. More profound state of immunosuppression.
Opportunistic infections and tumors develop in this stage and in the fifth
stage, such as: toxoplasmosis, a fungal infection of the brain or other organs;
Kaposi's sarcoma (tumors of the blood vessels, often in the mouth); pneumocystis
pneumonia, which gives a hacking cough and shortness of breath, cytomegalovirus
(in the retina, liver or gastrointestinal system); cryptococcal meningitis,
another fungal infection.

    5. Advanced HIV disease. When the immune system is so damaged that it is
susceptible to particularly agressive infections that are difficult to treat and
lead to death. It can be marked by wasting disease, an unexplained condition
that causes extreme weight loss, as if the body were melting away. This stage
lasts up to two years.

Landlord agrees to settle   AIDS discrimination costs $9,000

BYLINE: ANDRE PICARD; GAM

LENGTH: 395 words


BY  ANDRE PICARD
 The Globe and Mail
    An Ottawa landlord who reneged on a lease when he learned his building
would be visited by people with AIDS has agreed to pay $9,000 to resolve a
discrimination complaint filed with the Ontario Human Rights Commission .

David Hoe , executive director of the AIDS Committee of Ottawa , said
the decision is important because it will open doors to AIDS patients who
are seeking accommodation.

He said that, because of misconceptions about the illness, landlords
are wary of renting to AIDS patients, and now people with AIDS and their
friends will have a powerful weapon to fight back with.

"There are two important precedents here: The Ontario Human Rights
Commission has accepted that AIDS is a disability that falls within the
terms of protection of the law and it is wrong to discriminate against
AIDS patients who want accommodation, either offices or living quarters,"
Mr. Hoe said.

Raj Anand, the commission chairman, said he hopes the settlement will
contribute to educating the public about AIDS, and send a strong message
that people with AIDS are protected by Ontario law.

"Persons with AIDS, AIDS-related complex or HIV infection are
frequently confronted with, and subject to, abusive treatment based on
misinformation and insensitivity," he said.

"Clearly, having AIDS and wanting to rent or lease premises have
nothing to do with each other. Settlements such as this one are a
necessary first step in educating the people of Ontario to differentiate
between the myths and realities relating to AIDS," Mr. Anand said.

In the case before the commission, the landlord, whose name cannot be
revealed, and the AIDS Committee of Ottawa signed an offer to lease but
the landlord backed out of the deal when he realized people with AIDS
would frequent the premises.

The landlord told the AIDS committee that it would have to install
separate washrooms in its offices and guarantee that none of its clients
would use the public washrooms.

AIDS is not passed on through casual contact and cannot be contracted
from a toilet seat.

After negotiations mediated by the human rights commission, the
landlord agreed to pay the AIDS committee $8,000 and an additional $1,000
to Grant McNeil, the group's former executive director, who was forced to
operate the group out of his home. Mr. McNeil will also receive a letter
of apology for the discrimination he suffered.

AIDS education in the workplace Disease casts a shadow on industry because it
hits most those aged 20-49 - the workforce's strength

BYLINE: By Lillian Newbery Toronto Star

SECTION: INSIGHT; Pg. B6

LENGTH: 1106 words


   About a year ago, the 650 employees at the head office of Imperial Life on
St. Clair Ave. W., received an information sheet about AIDS in the workplace and
an invitation to see a video about AIDS.

Those who went to watch the video, shown on company time, also got their first
look at the company's new policy on AIDS.

Although a great deal of education and policy-making has gone on in public
sector workplaces, Imperial Life was among the earliest Canadian employers in
the private sector to draw up an AIDS policy and educate employees about the
syndrome.

It has killed more than 800 Canadians. Another 50,000 are believed to be
infected with the virus that transmits AIDS.

The likelihood that management and employees will have to deal with AIDS
directly because of an individual on staff is increasing, says Dr. David
McKeown, medical officer of health for East York.

Other companies that have taken the initiative include IBM Canada Ltd., Bell
Canada and Guaranty Trust Co. Ltd.

At the first session at Imperial Life, medical director Dr. Tom Porter
introduced a video called An Epidemic Of Fear: AIDS And The Workplace, made by
the San Francisco AIDS Foundation.

QUESTION PERIOD

Then the workers were given five minutes to read the company's policy on AIDS,
drawn up in consultation almost word by word with the Ontario Human Rights
Commission. Afterward, Porter and Gordon Stewart of the personnel department
answered questions.

Basically, the policy says Imperial Life will not discriminate by refusing to
hire a person who has or is suspected of having AIDS, although he will not be
eligible for life insurance. Employees who develop AIDS may continue to work as
long as they can with all their benefits. The company believes it's not possible
to catch AIDS in the workplace from non-sexual contact, but if working with
someone who has the syndrome causes problems for a co-worker, "this will be
dealt with like any other performance problem."

"The goal was to have a base of knowledge in the staff before we have a case, so
if we get one we can remind them that we had told them the facts before and that
they haven't changed," says Porter.

This preparation avoids anxiety, possible work disruptions and inappropriate
personnel decisions, says Dr. David Walters, head of the of the Canadian Public
Health Association, AIDS Education and Awareness Program.

"AIDS casts a giant shadow on industry because it is most prevalent in those
between the ages of 20 to 49 - the very strength of the workforce," Dr. Frank
Young, U.S. Food and Drug Administration commissioner, told the annual meeting
of the World Economic Forum in Switzerland last month.

Imperial Life employees who attended the education session at their head office
liked the fact the sessions were frank, Porter says.

Porter says he received help preparing the session from Anne Boulby, consultant
with the Ontario Public Education Panel on AIDS. Imperial Life already had a
policy of hiring the disabled.

While some people felt comfortable asking questions about topics like anal sex
in front of their co-workers, others came up to him later to inquire about the
risks of oral sex or to ask if he was really sure that AIDS is hard to get.

Because of demand, the session had to be repeated twice last spring and again in
the fall. "About 40 per cent have been to the session and they're selling it to
the others."

Imperial Life subsequently made its own video, incorporating Porter's
introductory remarks, an updated version of the San Francisco video and more
information about company policy. It's been shown at other branches, where some
managers have made viewing compulsory, and is available for employees to take
home to show their families.

And because AIDS educators say people may need to hear the facts about AIDS up
to five times before they absorb them, the company this year gave out a
pamphlet, AIDS - The New Facts Of Life, from the Canadian Public Health
Association, different from the factsheet, AIDS In The Workplace, produced by
the Ontario Public Education Panel on AIDS.

FRANK PAMPHLET

Last April, David Skene, vice-president of personnel at Guaranty Trust Co. of
Canada, sent a memo to nearly 2,000 employees. Enclosed were Ontario's AIDS
workplace factsheet in English or French and a frank pamphlet from the AIDS
Committee of Toronto or a French-language one from a Montreal AIDS committee.

Skene says the company had two objectives: "First we want everyone to have
adequate, accurate information available to assist them in avoiding the
possibility of contracting the disease. Second, we want to ensure that any
employee who does contract the disease is treated with compassion and
understanding by co-workers during a very difficult period of their life."

Resources are available to businesses that want to get involved in AIDS
education but don't have the expertise, East York's David McKeown says. Public
health units and community AIDS groups will provide experienced speakers and
videos can be rented or borrowed.

When labor groups have concerns about AIDS transmission, a third party can be
helpful, he adds.

About $65,000 has been added to the East York health unit's budget for AIDS
education in the community and much of this will go toward workplace education
in some of the borough's 950 businesses.

BRUSHFIRE OF ANXIETY

Joan Anderson, former chairman of the AIDS Committee of Toronto, recently hired
to work on the East York project, says even though education is provided to
employees, when the first case actually becomes known, a company may still face
a "brushfire" of anxiety.

"I don't think one-shot deals are enough," Anderson says. There are layers you
have to work through, first the basic information about contagion, concerns
about casual transmission. Then the deeper layers, such as how people feel
around the sexual issues, that in Canada AIDS affects so many gay men. These
attitudes may be quite separate from the factual information. With health
workers, we have found you have to give the information four or five times,
although others may not need that."

IBM Canada Ltd., whose education program started this year, has a policy that
employees with AIDS are treated the same as any individual with any illness,
says Norm Gordner, senior information representative.

"Basically we do not believe AIDS is a threat to anyone in the workplace."

Bell Canada has sent a pamphlet produced by its health department to 50,000
employees in Ontario, Quebec and the Northwest Territories.

A New Round For Legal Aid and Giuliani

BYLINE: By JAN HOFFMAN

SECTION: Section 1;   Page 41;   Column 5;   Metropolitan Desk;   Second Front

LENGTH: 1052 words


A month after Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani crushed a short, furious walkout by
Legal Aid Society lawyers, he has proposed budget cuts that the society says
could force layoffs of 25 percent of its staff and set off costly, trickle-down
chaos within the criminal-justice system.

But even as judges and some politicians joined Legal Aid's doomsday view, a city
official said that the society could well afford to lose some fat and still
maintain its current caseload.

And from those two polar opposite starting points, negotiations over Legal Aid's
future as the city's primary defender of the indigent are to resume this week
between Katie Lapp, the city's criminal justice coordinator, and Michael
Iovenko, the president of Legal Aid.

To fulfill the requirements of its contract with Legal Aid, the city gave the
lawyers formal notice last week that it would cancel the contract in 90 days.
Ms. Lapp and Mr. Iovenko are to discuss Legal Aid's new relationship with the
city, under the constraints of a reduced budget.

Whatever the final layoffs and budget cuts, Mr. Iovenko and Ms. Lapp agreed that
management-heavy Legal Aid would have to fundamentally change how it runs
itself.

But another consensus seemed to be emerging as well: that at the end of a
tumultuous month that saw the collapse of a strike by angry Legal Aid lawyers in
the face of the Mayor's threat of the organization's early death, Legal Aid's
solid 28-year relationship with the city has been irrevocably weakened, as has
its standing as a voice for the poor on a spectrum of issues.

On Tuesday, the Mayor announced in his package of cuts that he would shrink the
city's annual payments to Legal Aid's criminal defense and appeals divisions by
$12.5 million from a total of $79 million, a 16 percent reduction. Through cuts
to other programs, Legal Aid's services for people facing eviction would lose
$760,000.

Legal Aid officials calculate that since four months of the fiscal year have
already passed, the cut is equivalent to nearly $19 million from an annual
budget.

Legal Aid lawyers handle about 226,000 cases a year, or about 60 percent of the
overall caseload. Up to 158 of Legal Aid's 632 criminal-defense lawyers may be
laid off, its officials say.

As Legal Aid's secretaries, supervisors and junior lawyers brace themselves for
pink slips, which Legal Aid officials say could come by mid-November, some
judges predict that the cuts will not only cost the city millions of dollars but
also strain overcrowded courts and jails, forcing the early release of some
dangerous prisoners whose cases have languished.

In short, said Judge Burton B. Roberts, the chief administrative judge of Bronx
Supreme Court, "The impact on the criminal justice system would be devastating."

And, judges and Legal Aid officials say, the cut is lopsided -- budgets for the
city's district attorneys' offices were untouched. At the same time, arrests are
jumping, largely because of the Mayor's insistence on a crackdown of "quality of
life" crimes. For the first nine months of 1994, misdemeanor arrests rose 28.9
percent over the same period in 1993, about 17,000 cases more, according to
Detective Lisa Guerriero, a Police Department spokeswoman.

But Ms. Lapp, the city's criminal justice coordinator, defended the falling ax
and said fears of huge layoffs and resulting mayhem were overblown. Legal Aid,
she said, could keep its current caseload and not have to lose lawyers.

If Legal Aid could afford to give its managers a raise and offer union members a
bonus, Ms. Lapp said, referring to events last summer and earlier this month,
then certainly fat could be cut from its budget: "It's consistent with what the
Mayor said during the strike," she said.

She also disputed the conventional wisdom that Legal Aid lawyers are desperately
overworked. But should some layoffs be necessary, she said: "I am not confident
that they need all the staff they have, to do the amount of work that is out
there. The caseload carried by these attorneys is very, very low."

In Manhattan and Brooklyn, a Legal Aid lawyer carries 40 pending cases on
average -- roughly 9 felonies and 31 misdemeanors. Bronx and Queens Legal Aid
lawyers average 10 more cases each.

Robert M. Baum, the chief of Legal Aid's criminal defense division, said that in
some boroughs, Legal Aid lawyers had as many or fewer cases than private lawyers
assigned by judges to represent the indigent.

But Mr. Baum said that respective caseloads did not tell the full story. He said
studies had shown that Legal Aid lawyers moved their cases up to 40 days faster
than private assigned lawyers, and so saved the city money in prison costs.

Speculation has run high that if Legal Aid must make the cuts it has forecast,
30,000 of its cases will be turned over to assigned lawyers, who the Mayor said
this summer were costing the city far too much.

Patricia Bath, a spokeswoman for Legal Aid, said that transferring those cases
to lawyers in the Assigned Counsel Plan would ultimately cost the city $31.6
million.

Another judge who said he was concerned about the proposed cuts, James A. Yates,
Acting Supreme Court Justice, said that something was being lost in all the
number-crunching: the value placed on the quality of representation that Legal
Aid offers. While not discrediting the lawyers in the Assigned Counsel Plan, who
are mostly solo practitioners, Judge Yates said that Legal Aid provided clients
with investigative services, interpreters, social-service liaisons, an appeals
division and class-action litigation, as well as a hierarchy that trains new
lawyers.

And while those young lawyers are indeed inexperienced, they are essential to
the vaunted idealism of Legal Aid, said Michael Z. Letwin, the president of the
Association of Legal Aid Attorneys, which represents nearly 1,000 staff lawyers.

"There's a lot to be said for the new blood -- they're the most effervescent and
that's what they bring to clients," he said. They will be among the first to be
laid off.

Ms. Bath said that the 1994 class of 64 Legal Aid fledglings had been plucked
from about 2,400 applicants. Forty percent are minority lawyers and 60 percent
are women.

And recruiting at law schools for future classes has stopped. "We have nothing
to offer them," said Ms. Bath.

Flaws in Health Care System Emerge as Epidemic Rages

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

SECTION: Section A; Page 1, Column 5; National Desk

LENGTH: 1878 words


The changing AIDS epidemic is exposing gaps and weaknesses throughout the
nation's health care system as growing multitudes of patients need a wider array
of services.

''AIDS highlights all the flaws in American health care: the lack of preventive
medicine, primary physician care, long-term facilities, home care, universal
insurance and drug treatment,'' said Dr. Jo Ivey Boufford, president of New York
City's Health and Hospitals Corporation.

As the epidemic enters its ninth year, the impact of AIDS on health care and the
availability of services varies drastically by region and economic class.

Although many AIDS patients are getting good care, cities with high caseloads
are strained, health officials say. Poor patients without health insurance in
places with sparse services are the most deprived, but even middle-class
patients are often forced into penury and reliance on Federal Medicaid to pay
their enormous medical bills.

''We've got big holes in our safety net,'' said Dr. Lonnie R. Bristow, a
spokesman on AIDS issues for the American Medical Association.

In cities with large caseloads, like New York, hospitals are increasingly filled
with AIDS patients who could receive less expensive and more humane treatment
through other kinds of institutions, like nursing homes, hospices and home care
services. Yet such alternative forms of care are vastly inadequate to meet even
the current need, let alone the burgeoning number of patients projected in the
years ahead.

As of Jan. 30, about 85,000 AIDS cases had been reported; more than 36,000
patients were alive and in potential need of care and services. The greatest
challenge, though, lies ahead. The Centers for Disease Control projects that
102,000 patients diagnosed with AIDS will be living by the end of 1992.

By that year, these Federal experts project, 205,000 to 440,000 Americans will
have developed AIDS.

More than 25 percent of new patients today are drug addicts, their sex partners
and babies - the groups most likely to need public assistance. These groups,
mainly blacks and Hispanic people from the inner city, account for a gradually
rising share of the nation's cases and a majority in some cities including New
York.

Cases of full-fledged AIDS are only part of the problem. Access to public funds
and services is tenuous for those suffering from illnesses caused by the same
virus but not technically defined as AIDS cases, medical experts say. And little
is being done so far to help most of the estimated one million Americans who
have the AIDS virus but who are not yet sick and may not even know they are
infected. They could benefit from early care, according to health experts.

A Crucial Role For Insurance

The quality of AIDS care depends on many factors, and private health insurance
is often crucial. Many patients get adequate treatment, especially if they have
insurance and personal physicians in cities with sophisticated care.

But many other AIDS patients do not get proper care, health experts say. The
epidemic spreads increasingly among the poor, who become charity or Medicaid
cases and sometimes get second-class medical treatment. Many typically show up
in emergency rooms with little time left to live.

Even those with insurance can lose it, fired because of sickness or
discrimination from jobs that provide insurance. Federal authorities estimate
that 60 percent of AIDS patients end up on Medicaid. That could increase as
insurance companies seek to bar AIDS patients from individual policies.

City Hospitals Hit

Municipal hospitals are especially hard hit, according to the National
Association of Public Hospitals. New York's flagship city hospital, Bellevue, is
swamped with AIDS patients, who occupy 27 percent of its general beds.

Another problem is limited health care for the indigent in many Southern and
Western states that have chosen to limit their participation in the Medicaid
program. AIDS organizations cite instances of patients dying helplessly in the
streets.

''There are not enough beds - hospitals don't want you unless you have insurance
- and people are thrown on the streets,'' said Harry Livesay, a case manager for
the AIDS Foundation of Houston.

Most of the nation's health care institutions are coping with the influx of AIDS
patients without severe disruption. But some have simply avoided dealing with
AIDS. Nursing homes, for example, have accepted hardly any AIDS patients.
Alternative services like hospices and home care are scarce.

An Epidemic's New Needs

The epidemic's changing dynamics are creating needs for more and different
services.

With improving treatment, some patients are surviving longer. Although no magic
cure or vaccine is in the offing, AZT sometimes prolongs lives.

AIDS is emerging as an episodic illness. Patients may be bedridden during
relapses, then recover to a normal routine. Many patients gradually weaken,
requiring help in daily life but not, in most periods, acute hospital care.

''The good news is people are living longer, but that means more services,''
said Paul Kirchgraber of the nonprofit AIDS Project in Los Angeles. John S.
Mortimer, the group's government affairs director, said: ''AIDS is becoming more
an issue of living than dying. If someone has only two months to live, you can
ignore a lot of things and get by. But if they're living two years, you can't
ignore their needs.''

Voluntary agencies like the AIDS Project and the Gay Men's Health Crisis in New
York have sprung up to help meet needs like home food delivery and assistance
with wills. But such groups are much less advanced among the inner-city patients
whose numbers are rising.

Trying to Plan How to Pay

What worries planners most, given the current patchwork of local, state and
Federal programs, is preparing for the impending waves of patients.

''The AIDS agenda for 1989 is carved right in the wall: How to pay for
compassionate care for those who need it now and in the future,'' said June E.
Osborn, the University of Michigan's dean of public health.

Analysts estimate the average lifetime cost of AIDS treatment at about $60,000,
with wide regional variations. California finds spending per case in Los Angeles
is double the cost in San Francisco, which relies on volunteer agencies and
nonhospital care whenever possible.

Earlier forecasts that AIDS would bankrupt insurance companies, hospitals and
governments have not materialized. It is estimated that AIDS care will cost $3
billion this year, half a percent of the nation's health bill. But that share
will grow as the cases rise.

The burden has fallen unevenly on big cities and the leading AIDS states of New
York, California, Florida, New Jersey and Texas. AIDS officials frequently
complain that money is hard to come by.

Strictly defined AIDS cases represent only a small part of the epidemic. AIDS
programs show glaring omissions for those who do not qualify as AIDS patients
but suffer from related illnesses caused by infection with the AIDS virus. The
number of these is not recorded, but researchers believe it is many times the
total of outright AIDS cases.

''People with AIDS-related complex may be just as sick but don't automatically
qualify for disability; we all realize that's a problem,'' said Richard
Chambers, intergovermental affairs director for the Federal Health Care
Financing Administration. In New York City, people with AIDS-related complex are
denied housing assistance available to those diagnosed with AIDS.

Still more significant are those who are infected but do not show symptoms and
the absence of a comprehensive program to get them counseled, tested and
medically monitored.

''If everybody who is positive got tested, there wouldn't be anywhere near
enough doctors to handle them,'' said Paul Wychulas, executive director of Body
Positive, a group of New Yorkers who have the virus.

The Points Of Strain

Compared to the rest of the nation, New York's AIDS crisis stands in a class by
itself, burdened with the largest caseload at a time when its hospitals are
perilously jammed.

AIDS is only one cause. The others include a state cutback in beds, lack of
public funds, increasing burdens related to the crack epidemic, and shortages of
housing and nursing homes for discharged patients.

''We just don't have enough beds and nurses to take care of everybody, AIDS or
not,'' said Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital
Association.

There are other weak links. In states with limited Medicaid, poor patients with
AIDS and other illnesses sometimes go without services, said Samuel C. Matheny,
associate administrator of the Federal Health Services and Resources
Administration.

''People are burning logs in pans to keep warm,'' said Mr. Livesay in Houston.
''People who have lost control of their bowels or urinary function and can't get
out of bed are living in their own filth. I have seen this. Ambulatory people
with dementia, there's no facility for them. They walk in front of cars or
through glass windows.''

Even San Francisco, hailed as the model for services, feels strained. Some
officials say further AIDS spending will jeopardize other city services.

Politics and Prospects

Agitating for more money and helping to fill the service gaps, nonprofit AIDS
organizations continue to proliferate, from 400 to 580 last year alone, says the
coordinating National AIDS Network. These agencies say they have trouble keeping
abreast of needs.

From city halls to Washington, officials have pleaded for more AIDS services. In
the past year, a Presidential commission proposed a national program, San
Francisco and New York issued local AIDS plans, and others are following suit.

But these proposals come at a bad time, when all levels of government are
grappling with deficits. In California, Gov. George Deukmejian has proposed cuts
in state funds for AIDS.

''Ultimately, the most difficult questions surrounding AIDS can be resolved only
by money,'' said Thomas B. Stoddard, director of Lambda Legal Defense and
Education Fund, a gay rights group.

Bitter Competition Feared

As AIDS patients compete with others for health care, Dr. David E. Rogers, a New
York AIDS official, fears ''the possibility for bitter social conflicts, with
racial overtones.'' Gaining support for AIDS-related funding may become even
more difficult as the disease is increasingly associated with poor minorities.

Advocates look to the Bush Administration with hope and uncertainty, after eight
years of faulting President Reagan. The new President's tone has appeared to be
decidedly more sympathetic, but there is no guarantee that will translate into
more funds.

A new national AIDS commission, mandated by Congress, is being formed to seek
enactment of last year's commission report. But like the old commission, the new
one does not have the power to order action.

Public health experts offer glum assessments of how well the nation is meeting
the growing challenge of AIDS.

''We will take a hell of a beating -we already are,'' said New York City's
health commissioner, Dr. Stephen C. Joseph. At the University of Michigan, Dr.
Osborn said, ''We are running a desperate race against some awful projections.''

FEARS ON AIDS TERMED LARGELY WITHOUT CAUSES

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

SECTION: Section B; Page 3, Column 1; Metropolitan Desk

LENGTH: 1588 words


Fear and misinformation about AIDS are pervasive in the nation and, in recent
days, have been particularly evident in New York City, where there has been
intense debate over whether children with the disease should be allowed into the
classroom.

AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, destroys the body's ability to
fight disease. Now incurable and believed to be always fatal, the disease has
stricken more than 13,000 Americans, already killing more than half, and the
number of victims is expected to double in the next year.

The cases have been largely confined to homosexuals, users of intravenous drugs
and recipients of contaminated blood transfusions, those in the so-called
high-risk groups.

Medical authorities say that although the threat of AIDS is serious, many of the
fears people have expressed about how the disease can be transmitted are
unfounded. These are the answers of leading medical scientists to commonly asked
questions about AIDS.

Q. What bodily secretions carry the AIDS virus?

A. The virus is known to be transmitted only through blood and sexual
secretions. It has also been isolated in some instances in saliva and tears,
though in extremely low levels, but not in perspiration, urine or feces. Federal
officials suggest caution in handling any of these substances from infected
people, but say transmission by them has never been demonstrated and is
extremely unlikely. Q. How contagious is AIDS?  A. Strong evidence indicates
that large quantities of such infected materials as blood or sexual discharges
must enter the body to spread the disease, according to Federal experts.
Materials that could theoretically carry the virus in small amounts, such as
saliva sprayed in a cough or a sneeze or left on a drinking glass, have not been
implicated as the cause of any case.

The virus cannot pass through skin and apparently must enter through the mouth,
mucous membranes, open wounds or other openings. Apart from newborns who got the
disease from infected mothers, the transmissions have apparently been limited to
sexual contacts, the sharing of hypodermic needles and blood transfusions.

Q. Can AIDS spread through nonsexual personal contact?

A. Not a single case of AIDS has been attributed to nonsexual contact with
infected individuals. Apart from infants born to infected mothers or sexual
partners of infected patients, not one family member of the more than 13,000
victims reported to the Federal Centers for Disease Control has become infected
with the virus, despite what in many cases was years of close contact with an
infected person, including hugging, kissing and sharing of tableware and
bathrooms.

Q. Is it safe to allow children with AIDS to attend school?

A. The Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta recommend that decisions be
tailored to the individual case. But it asserts that ''casual person-to-person
contact, as would occur among schoolchildren, appears to pose no risk'' of
transmitting the AIDS virus. It adds that most children with AIDS should be
allowed in classrooms.

For prechool children or those who lack control of their body secretions,
display biting behavior or have uncoverable, oozing lesions, the agency said,
''a more restricted environment is advisable until more is known about
transmission in these settings.'' But the centers say there is no evidence that
AIDS has been spread through bites or contact with saliva, urine or cuts.

Q. How have children become infected with AIDS?

A. The majority of the 164 children under the age of 13 reported with AIDS as of
last Monday acquired the virus from mothers with AIDS, usually while in the
womb, although some have been infected from mother's blood during delivery, and
transmission via breast milk may be possible.

About 20 percent of the children with AIDS were infected by transfusions of
blood or blood products. Teen-age victims have acquired the disease through such
''adult'' routes as sexual contact, transfusions and the use of contaminated
needles.

Q. What could happen if you help an AIDS victim clean up a bleeding cut?

A. Viruses in the victim's blood could in theory infect another person if they
had a means of bodily entry such as an open wound. But ''if you get a spot of
infected blood on you, that's not going to give you AIDS,'' said Dr. Martha
Rogers of the Centers for Disease Control, who stressed that large quantities of
the virus seemed to be necessary for the infection's spread. No cases of
transmission via cuts have been recorded.

Q. What could happen if a child is bitten by another with AIDS?

A. No cases have been attributed to biting, and the amount of virus, if any, in
the saliva of AIDS patients is considered too slight to transmit the infection.
Repeated tests of the siblings of children with AIDS have found no transmissions
of the virus.

Because of the theoretical possibility the virus could be in saliva and enter a
cut, officials suggest keeping infected children known to have a tendency to
bite others out of classrooms. But if a bite by an AIDS victim did occur, ''we
wouldn't be particularly worried,'' Dr. Rogers said.

Q. Can AIDS be spread in swimming pools?

A. Chlorine kills the virus and, in any case, any infectious secretions would be
so diluted they would be harmless, experts believe.

Q. Does an AIDS-infected food handler or waiter pose any threat?

A. Experts say there is no reason to think the virus can be transmitted by an
infected person handling food. This has not happened within close family
environments. Many AIDS patients have worked in restaurants, and officials say
that if the disease could be transmitted by food handling, such cases would have
been discovered by now.

Q. Can AIDS be spread on surfaces in restrooms and locker rooms?

A. Officials say there is no evidence AIDS can be caught from toilets, showers
or other surfaces in restrooms or locker rooms. The Centers for Disease Control
recommend using a water-diluted bleach solution, which kills the AIDS virus,
when cleaning up spilled blood, vomit or other matter from AIDS patients.

Q. Can AIDS be transmitted through heterosexual contact, and do prostitutes pose
a special hazard?

A. About 1 percent of the American AIDS cases appear to have resulted from
heterosexual contact, usually with a partner who was an intravenous drug user.

The evidence indicates that the virus can be passed during intercourse both from
men to women and from women to men, although many scientists suspect that
transmission occurs less easily from women to men.

Officials say that because many prostitutes are drug addicts, and some have been
found to have the AIDS virus in their blood, men consorting with prostitutes are
increasing their risks of exposure to AIDS.

Q. How safe are blood transfusions?

A. According to Dr. Harold Jaffe of the Centers for Disease Control,
transfusions are now extremely safe. The number of potentially infectious donors
has been greatly reduced since members of high-risk groups have been urged not
to donate blood, and all donated blood is now screened for the AIDS virus with a
very sensitive test.

The test is at least 95 percent reliable, according to Dr. Jaffe, but the risk
of infection through blood transfusions was very small to begin with; only a few
hundred cases of AIDS were spread by transfusions.

Q. Does medicine have any tools for fighting AIDS?

A. Researchers are trying to find ways to stimulate the body's AIDS-weakened
immune system, the system that the body uses to fight disease, and are
experimenting with drugs that inhibit growth of the AIDS virus. But neither
approach has succeeded in curing patients. Although research on a potential
vaccine against AIDS is pressing ahead, key questions about how the virus might
be countered have not been answered, and scientists cannot predict when they
will succeed.

Q. What about the long incubation period of the AIDS virus before it causes
disease? Isn't it possible that cases transmitted through other forms of contact
will show up in future years?

A. The lack of AIDS among family members of AIDS victims provides powerful
evidence against modes of transmission other than those already identified.
Studies indicate that adults who develop AIDS become ill, on average, about two
years after infection with the virus, children one year later. Thus, many family
members of recent AIDS victims spent years interacting closely with infected
individuals before knowing about the presence of the disease, but none showed
evidence of the AIDS virus in their blood as a result.

Q. Is the United States experiencing an AIDS epidemic?

A. Federal authorities call the current outbreak of AIDS an epidemic, a term
technically used to describe any unexpected increase in the incidence of a
disease and often used to describe any seriously increasing health threat.

Q. Why do Federal officials seem to vacillate when they describe the
transmission routes of AIDS, saying, for example, that infection via saliva
''has not been documented'' and that no cases ''are known to have been
transmitted'' in schools? Why can't they make a conclusive statement?

A. ''It's very difficult to prove that something never happens,'' Dr. Rogers
said. Even after many additional years of observation, scientists will be
reluctant to make absolute statements about AIDS transmission processes they do
not fully understand. ''But we obviously believe,'' Dr. Rogers said, ''the
evidence thus far indicates that transmission by casual contact will never
occur.''

ARTICLE: COMMISSION NOTICE ON THE ENFORCEMENT OF STATE AID LAW BY NATIONAL
COURTS

NAME: Christodoulos Kaoutzanis  n1

LEXISNEXIS SUMMARY:
 ... The present notice is largely based on the 2005 Commission State Aid Action
Plan ("the SAAP") and on a study that demonstrates there has been an increase in
state aid disputes in national courts of the individual Member States, and comes
to replace an earlier one from 1995 on the same topic.  ... State aid has direct
effect in the Member States, and as such is directly applicable without
incorporating legislative actions from the Member States.  ... In the lifeline
of a particular state aid scheme, the role of national authorities is also
important.  ... In the first instance, the national government creates the
scheme of assistance.  ... Initially, lawsuits arise when Member States decide
not to ask for the Commission's approval of a plan.  ... AREAS OF PRIMARY
CONCERN The notice covers three interrelated areas: the relevant limits for
bringing a state aid claim (i.e. the issue of standing), the role of national
courts in recovery of illegal state aid, and forms of cooperation between
national courts and the Commission in the field of state aid.  ... Significant
Limits on Standing for a State Aid Claim The main limits placed upon the powers
of a national court have to do with standing of individual challenges.  ... In
Regie Networks , the ECJ opined that in case of doubt as to the direct and
individual involvement of a person in the state aid scheme, the ambiguity should
be resolved in favor of granting standing to that person, even if the prescribed
period, which consists of two months after person has knowledge, has expired.
... This situation is clearly illustrated by the "CELF" case, in which the aid
granted by the French government in violation of the standstill principle was
afterwards approved and the national court deemed it unnecessary to order the
recovery of the given sum.  ... First, the state court may ask the Commission to
transmit relevant information in its possession, subject to the Commission's
guarantee of professional secrecy and independent functioning.  ... The notice
emphasizes the crucial role that national jurisdictions have in the
decentralized enforcement scheme of Community state aid rules.

TEXT:
 [*7]  On February 25, 2009, the EU Commission issued the Notice on the
Enforcement of State Aid Law by National Courts.  n2 The purpose of the notice
is to aid national courts in state aid disputes and provide other relevant
parties with a user-friendly manual on this issue. The present notice is largely
based on the 2005 Commission State Aid Action Plan ("the SAAP")  n3 and on a
study that demonstrates there has been an increase in state aid disputes in
national courts of the individual Member States,  n4 and comes to replace an
earlier one from 1995 on the same topic.  n5

In reality, the Commission does not propose any procedural or substantive legal
departure. Instead, relying heavily on the EC Treaty  n6 and relevant case law,
it merely aims to support national courts and potential claimants of domestic
state aid challenges by elucidating the process.

Amid the current financial crisis and the urgent measures adopted by a multitude
of European capitals, the Commission's clarification and reiteration of the
applicable law appear to be opportune. National courts have been significant
fora for the settlement of state aid claims, which include, for example,
lawsuits by competitors against parties receiving state aid or lawsuits by
parties defending against the imposition of allegedly discriminatory tax
measure. State aid is defined in Article 87 EC as "any aid granted by a Member
State . . . which distorts or threatens to distort competition."  n7 Such aid is
considered to be incompatible with the common market.

   I. STATE AID LIFE-CYCLE

National authorities play a paramount role on the domain of state aid. State aid
has direct effect in the Member States, and as such is directly applicable
without incorporating legislative actions from the Member States. As a result,
national courts are obliged to enforce the state aid provisions of the EC Treaty
directly in any action on this issue.

 [*8]  In the lifeline of a particular state aid scheme, the role of national
authorities is also important. It can be broken down into four procedural
phases. In the first instance, the national government creates the scheme of
assistance. This assistance does not have to be monetary payments, as other
amenities (such as tax breaks) amount to state aid. Second, if the Member State
understands that the proposed plan is or might be state aid, it has to request
the Commission's approval before implementing it. Alternatively, if the Member
State believes that the plan is not state aid it can proceed to its
implementation. Third, the Member State acts according to the Commission's
response, which is based on an investigation conducted at the community level. A
negative decision by the Commission does not preclude the Member State from
altering a rejected plan and asking for a de novo approval. Last, once an
assistance plan is in place, the Member State has to make sure that the payments
and the due dates are followed according to the Commission's approval.

All state aid actions may give rise to civil action in the national courts of
the Member State. Initially, lawsuits arise when Member States decide not to ask
for the Commission's approval of a plan. In such a case, an individual may bring
suit in the national courts for a violation of the standstill principle,
according to which a Member State may not implement a state aid scheme prior to
the Commission's approval. Alternatively, at this point an affected party may
notify the Commission of the plan's existence, hoping that the Commission will
condemn the plan, which will lead to recovery.

Despite their overall broad authority, national courts are precluded from
dealing with actions that challenge the Commission's approval of the state aid.
Such lawsuits have to be brought in front of the ECJ, which is the only court
competent to review the Commission's decision.

In case a state aid scheme is rejected by the Commission and aid has already
been granted, the aid given out under its auspices is to be recovered. Recovery,
as discussed below, may often be an issue, as Member States may violate the
standstill principle and grant aid before notifying the Commission.

   II. MAIN REASONS

There are two guiding purposes behind the Commission's action. First, the notice
aims to inform all relevant parties about the available remedies in case of a
breach of the EU state aid rules. This objective targets a wide array of actors,
as the affected parties in state aid issues encompass national courts and anyone
directly and individually involved in the scheme,  n8 which expands the category
well beyond the state-aid-granting authority and the recipient. Second, the
notice purports to give the national courts guidance on the practical
application of the state aid rules, since these courts have proved to be of
central importance in the enforcement of community state aid rules, which
includes proceedings regarding the recovery of illegal state aid. As a result,
the Commission provides explicit methods of help to national courts.

 [*9]  III. AREAS OF PRIMARY CONCERN

The notice covers three interrelated areas: the relevant limits for bringing a
state aid claim (i.e. the issue of standing), the role of national courts in
recovery of illegal state aid, and forms of cooperation between national courts
and the Commission in the field of state aid.

   A. Significant Limits on Standing for a State Aid Claim

The main limits placed upon the powers of a national court have to do with
standing of individual challenges. Standing refers to the right of an individual
to bring forth a certain legal action. The notice highlights that, on the issue
of state aid, national courts are only competent to determine whether a
particular plan falls under an approved aid scheme and have no power to deal
with the validity of a Commission decision.

Under Article 230 EC, the Commission's decision can be challenged only by the
addressees of the Commission's decision or persons, real and legal, directly and
individually concerned by the state aid scheme.  n9 The latter category has
received significant elaboration by the ECJ case law, culminating in the recent
decision of the "Regie Networks" case.  n10 In Regie Networks, the ECJ opined
that in case of doubt as to the direct and individual involvement of a person in
the state aid scheme, the ambiguity should be resolved in favor of granting
standing to that person, even if the prescribed period, which consists of two
months after person has knowledge,  n11 has expired.  n12 This recent decision
consists of an important broadening of judicial power in the field of state aid,
as it significantly modifies the "Deggendorf" case, which denied standing to
parties that did not bring their claim within the prescribed period of two
months.  n13

Persons who have locus standi under Article 230 EC must bring challenges to the
Commission's decision directly to the ECJ.  n14 These persons cannot challenge
the validity of the Commission's decision through the preliminary ruling
procedure under Article 234 EC.  n15

   B. Recovery of State Aid

The national courts possess significant power in ordering the recovery of
unlawful aid and interest accrued thereon. Indeed, the notice spells out how the
national courts are central in enforcing decisions adopted under Article 14 (1)
of the Procedural Regulation  n16 when the Commission has assessed that the
grant is unlawful and incompatible with the common market. Due to the direct
effect of Article 88 EC,  n17 national courts have to ensure that the recovery
of  [*10]  unlawful aid is immediate. As such, the power to order recovery has
its basis in directly applicable community law and does not require further
actions at the level of the European Union. For the recovery determination, the
notice underscores that the Community, and hence the national courts, applies a
very strict standard, and that a beneficiary of unlawful aid cannot assert the
creation of an expectation's interest since a diligent enterprise would have
sought to clarify the lawfulness of the aid before depending on it.

An additional area of primary responsibility highlighted in the notice is the
"standstill" principle. Accordingly, under Article 88(3) EC  n18 and the
relevant case law,  n19 aid of which the Commission has not been notified or
which have been implemented before the Commission's approval is unauthorized. As
such, national courts have to, in most cases, proceed to its recovery.

Recovery, however, has some narrow limits. Under the "SFEI" case, exceptional
circumstances can make recuperation inappropriate.  n20 Furthermore, under the
"CELF" case, the national court's obligation to order full retrieval ceases the
moment that the Commission has already decided that the aid is compatible with
the common market.  n21 On the contrary, the notice interestingly clarifies that
a national court's obligation to order recovery and protect individual rights
under Article 88(3) EC remains unaffected where the Commission has not yet taken
a decision, regardless of whether a Commission procedure is pending or not.  n22


Apart from repossession of the given amount, the national court may also
properly order the recovery of interest. When the national court orders the full
recovery of the given sum, interest needs to be added. However, even if the
entire sum should not be recovered (for example, when the aid has been ex post
approved by the Commission), "CELF" allows for a national court to recover the
interest after a positive decision by the Commission when doing otherwise (not
regaining the accrued interest) would distort the common market.  n23 This
situation is clearly illustrated by the "CELF" case, in which the aid granted by
the French government in violation of the standstill principle was afterwards
approved and the national court deemed it unnecessary to order the recovery of
the given sum. The court, however, ordered the recovery of the accrued interest,
as it opined that the latter acted proactively in favor of the recipient in
violation of the free market during the years preceding the Commission's
approval.  n24

   C. Community Cooperation

In two ways, the Commission is trying to help national courts in making
decisions on the issue of state aid. First, the state court may ask the
Commission to transmit relevant information in its possession, subject to the
Commission's guarantee of professional secrecy and independent  [*11]
functioning. Second, the national courts may ask the Commission for an opinion
concerning the application of state aid rules.

Both measures are meant to help national courts with an ever-increasing docket
on state aid issues, while not sacrificing the Commission's neutrality and
objectivity as a guarantor of the public interest of the Union. Indeed, while
the Commission appears ready to participate in the national procedure with the
goal of facilitating the state aid procedures at the Member State level, it
remains bound by both the duty of professional secrecy and the safeguard of its
own functioning and independence.  n25

IV. CONCLUSION

The notice issued by the Commission is a document of significant importance. It
comes at the appropriate time, as state aid schemes appear attractive again to
many Member States in the midst of the global economic downturn.

The notice emphasizes the crucial role that national jurisdictions have in the
decentralized enforcement scheme of Community state aid rules. It not only
accomplishes a considerable legal synopsis of current EU law on state aid, but
it also extends the field of inter-institutional cooperation, notably between
the Commission and the national courts.  n26

State aid for businesses lives on despite new regional rules

SECTION: BUSINESS; Business

LENGTH: 704 words


Our love affair with EU funding is at an end, but there are more fish in the sea

IT DELIVERED more than  1.7bn to Irish regions between 1992 and 2005, so it's
hardly surprising that 'regional aid' enjoys a rather special place in the Irish
psyche.

For decades the crude instrument allowed the Government to pump squillions into
companies in regions throughout Ireland, along with achieving other regional
objectives.

But now that fairly epic love affair is coming to an end. New EU guidelines that
came in at the start of this year mean that companies in Dublin and the Mid East
are no longer eligible for any regIonal aid at all, while other areas can get a
declining level of regional aid.

Fall-off

Eight months on, however, the dreaded fall-off in State aid has yet to
materialise.

John Dunne, head of Chambers Ireland, says his organisation's 13,000 businesses
aren't particularly concerned about the recent state aid developments.
Enterprise Ireland, which gives aid to Irish companies on behalf of the state,
says the new regional aid guidelines will have only a minimal impact on their
activities. And the IDA, which gives aid to international companies based here,
stresses that regional aid makes up just a small part of the portfolio of
different aids on offer.

Indeed, the ones most excited by the recent developments seem to be the lawyers.
Jonathan Branton, of Matheson Ormsby Prentice is keen to stress that the
regional aid changes should not herald the end of State aid for businesses.

"What we're saying about it is that if you're a bit creative and thoughtful
there are still any number of ways in which the state can pump prime the economy
without having to resort to regional aid rules," he says.

That horse, it would seem, has already bolted.

Pat Kelly, who manages Ireland's state aid policy for the Department of
Enterprise, says the level of state aid given to businesses is not set to
dwindle, despite the ongoing demise of regional aid.

"It's not that we'll necessarily spend less money, just that it will just be
spent in different ways," he says. "We'll certainly see the regional aid reduce,
but we'll expect to see more aid spent in other areas."

Attractive

New guidelines for environmental aid are currently working their way to
Brussels. "At present we don't have much in terms of environmental schemes, but
the new rules are something the agencies would certainly be keeping a close eye
on," said Mr Kelly. "Something like environmental is certainly more attractive
in the Irish context now you can't give investment aid in some regions."

Another area being looked at is Research, Development and Innovation. The
Government, through its agencies, already offers a wide variety of incentives
for R&D. Mr Kelly said the Department had now applied to Europe to create a new
scheme which will also encompass aid for Innovation.

"For the first time the Commission has recognised innovation as a function
within companies which they're prepared to give aid for, so that's something
we're keen to bring in here," he said. "The way it will work is that companies
must use the money to buy specific service, it's not just free money."

Chambers' Mr Dunne said his members would welcome any aid for innovation, but he
stressed that the new State aid policies were a radical departure from the older
way of doing things.

"Traditionally the idea was that if a factory arrived, then the factory got aid,
" he says. "Or if I said I wanted to do something then I'd get aid for that.

"Now the aid seems to be much more driven by what the public policy objective
is. If you align yourself with that public policy objective then you'll get aid.
"

While the Government is planning to keep spending on State aid to business
constant, the shift in focus will be problematic for businesses.

The State agencies handling aid are predictably keen to downplay any impact, but
Enterprise Ireland admitted that larger companies in the Dublin and Mid East
regions planning investment and job creation packages would be hit. "It is
crucial to note that large companies in all regions will continue to be eligible
for research and development and management development projects," the agency
added quickly.

Foreign aid data automation round the corner

LENGTH: 585 words

DATELINE: Bangladesh


Bangladesh, Oct. 11 -- Automation of Bangladesh's database on foreign aid is now
at the final stage as the government is looking to ease the data entry and
reporting process of its digital aid portal, officials concerned said.

Once completed, the country will have the world's first automated Aid
Information Management System or AIMS, the officials noted.

Economic Relations Division (ERD), the nodal agency for foreign aid in
Bangladesh, is leading the automation process.

"The automation will enable automatic importing of Bangladesh's foreign aid data
from the global aid data repository of the International Aid Transparency
Initiative into the Bangladesh AIMS", ERD Additional Secretary Monowar Ahmed,
told FE.

"Such an automatic process will help significantly reduce the data entry and
reporting works and will also ensure greater accessibility and transparency of
foreign aid data", he added.

Although Bangladesh receives a significant amount of foreign aid each year,
up-to-date information on aid flows in the country, however, was only available
off line until recently.

Against this backdrop, ERD earlier embarked on a scheme to develop an Aid
Information Management System to provide a single entry window for all foreign
aid- related information in Bangladesh and to properly track and manage the aid
flows.

Aid Information Management System or AIMS, as it is often called, is a software
application that records and processes information on development activities and
related aid flows in a given country.

AIMS database can capture project-level information on commitments,
disbursements and expenditures of foreign aid by donor, implementer, sector and
geographic location.

Different kinds of AIMS software such as Development Assistance Database (DAD)
and Aid Management Platform (AMP) have already been deployed in more than 40
countries.

However, Bangladesh is one of the few countries to deploy a homegrown system as
its Aid Information Management System was developed through support from a local
software company called TechnoVista Limited.

The aid database is publicly accessible through ERD website and it is already
capturing almost 95 percent of the country's foreign aid data, ERD sources said.

A total of 46 development partners working in Bangladesh have already registered
on this database, a vast majority of which are already providing their aid data
into the system, they informed.

Nevertheless, it has often been observed both from the government and the
development partners' side that the present manual data entry procedure for the
AIMS system can be a time-consuming and cumbersome process.

In view of that, ERD later decided to go one step further and to automate its
aid information management system.

"The automation of AIMS will significantly reduce the time and effort currently
needed to enter the aid data in the AIMS system", said an official of a major
donor agency.

"If implemented properly, this can ensure better accuracy and consistency of
Bangladesh's aid data", he added.

"AIMS can go a long way in ensuring better coordination and stronger alignment
of foreign aid allocations with national priorities", Monwar Ahmed said.

"Easy access to comprehensive aid data will also make the government's planning
and budgeting more efficient", he added.

Senior Focus: Choosing the right hearing aid

BYLINE:  SENIOR FOCUS o Michael Valente > Washington University

SECTION: HEALTH; Pg. B2

LENGTH: 429 words


Baby boomers who rocked out at concerts are now finding themselves looking into
purchasing hearing aids.

One in three people older than 65 have hearing loss. Typically, the chief
complaint of these patients is, "I don't hear well in noise."

Hearing aid manufacturers have been working on technologies to address this
complaint, and significant advances have been achieved. Most hearing aids today
contain a microcomputer that is more sophisticated in responding to noise in the
environment, so people don't get background noise.

The new generation of hearing aids also automatically softens sounds that come
from behind and from the side to control feedback, or a high-pitched squeal.
Equally important to the successful use of hearing aids is how hearing aids are
fitted.

Just like eyeglasses, hearing aids require a prescription that is unique to each
person and ear. Often, it's not the brand or model of hearing aid that make a
difference but rather the manner in which the hearing aid is fitted.

According to current best practices, it is extremely important that audiologists
fitting hearing aids perform real ear measures (REM). This is a simple procedure
using software that measures the effectiveness of a hearing aid while in a
patient's ear. REM measures whether the hearing aid is providing ample
amplification across frequencies.

Unfortunately, audiologists do not use REM in approximately 75 percent to 80
percent of hearing aids fitted. Instead, they use software that fits hearing
aids using manufacturer guidelines.

Many of these guidelines reduce the amplification in the frequencies most
important for understanding speech and make the hearing aids ineffective.

If you visit an office to inquire about hearing aids, the first question to ask
is if REM is used.

Finally, every hearing aid style has different features. As you add more
features, both the benefits and costs increase. Some current hearing aids are
virtually automatic. Some also use Bluetooth technology to connect wirelessly to
cellphones, MP3 players, TVs, computers or radios.

Other hearing aids automatically can be adjusted for different listening
situations (quiet, noise, TV, music, telephone) or use a remote control to
change programs or change volume.

To find the hearing aid that works best, patients may have to try more than one.
Ask your audiologist if you can have a trial period. You and your audiologist
can collaborate to find the best hearing aid for you.

Taoiseach to press EU to tackle HIV, AIDS crisis in Africa

BYLINE: By MARK BRENNOCK, Political Correspondent

SECTION: CITY EDITION; HOME NEWS; Pg. 7

LENGTH: 749 words

DATELINE: CAPE TOWN


The Taoiseach has pledged to press the European Union to take concerted action
to tackle the rapid increase of AIDS in Africa, saying it is the biggest problem
facing that continent.

Speaking to reporters last night at the end of a five-day visit to southern
Africa, Mr Ahern said the extent of the AIDS crisis was the issue that had
struck him most forcefully during his trip. "Africa's biggest problem is the
AIDS problem. They are crying out for help," he said.

Mr Ahern said he believed his visit had been helpful towards boosting trade,
good bilateral political relations and the profile of Ireland Aid abroad. The
greatest assistance Europe could provide Africa, however, was in dealing with
AIDS, and he would ask the Irish EU Commissioner, whose responsibilities include
public health, to examine whether the EU could take practical measures to deal
with the issue.

He said there had been "no concerted campaign to deal with the situation where
10 per cent of the African population is infected".

Everyone he had met in Lesotho and South Africa had mentioned the AIDS issue to
him as their first or second priority, yet there had been little discussion at
EU level on the issue. "I haven't heard it discussed in any form, and then I
come down here and find out that it's the biggest problem."

He said there were powerful medical research interests in Europe, and he
believed they could be doing more about the AIDS problem in Africa.

In his own mind he had associated AIDS with "drugs and cities" and it was a
shock to go to rural drug-free parts of Lesotho "to see 40 per cent of the
people with it, and 50 per cent of those aged 18 to 35. I don't think the world
can just sit back and watch the figures get worse," Mr Ahern said.

He would also seek to help South Africa win the implementation of a (pounds) 4.8
billion trade and aid deal with the EU, currently being blocked by Italy and
Greece in a dispute over the branding of alcoholic products.

He expected a new document from the EU on the issue to be given to the South
African government shortly, possibly this weekend.

Jamie Smyth adds: In Dublin it has been learned that strategy to support the
prevention and to reduce the impact of HIV/AIDS in Africa will be made public by
the Department of Foreign Affairs at the end of this month. It is expected to
increase substantially the level of Ireland Aid financial support for HIV/AIDS
activities.

The plan outlined in An HIV/ AIDS Strategy for the Ireland Aid Programme, a
strategy document seen by The Irish Times was developed by the Irish Aid
Advisory Committee, in conjunction with African advisers working for Ireland Aid
who visited the Republic late last year.

The document notes that sub-Saharan Africa, the main focus of Ireland Aid
support, has taken a "disproportionate toll" of the disease. At the end of 1998,
67 per cent of global AIDS cases were estimated to be in the region. The
programme will support HIV/AIDS programmes in Ethiopia, Lesotho, Mozambique,
South Africa, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Ghana.

The health adviser to the Department of Foreign Affairs, Dr Vincent O'Neill,
said no specific financial package had been agreed for the programme, but it
would involve a substantial increase in funding.

The plan sets six key priority areas for Ireland Aid in the next three years.
These include significantly increasing the level of support for HIV/AIDS
sufferers, contributing to consciousness-raising and developing the capacity of
personnel at facilities supported by Ireland Aid.

On a practical level it will involve nominating a focal person at regional or
country level to co-ordinate Ireland Aid's response to HIV/AIDS.

There will be increased support at a multilateral level through organisations
such as UNAIDS, the World Health Organisation and the EU for activities focusing
on HIV/AIDS. The strategy will explore how Ireland Aid can integrate HIV/AIDS
programmes into its support for other aspects of its programmes and those of
indigenous and international NGOs.

The plan sets out the three strategic goals to which Ireland Aid can contribute
as institutional, broad-based and specific responses. It should improve the
awareness, responsiveness and effectiveness of Ireland Aid to HIV/ AIDS as a
development issue, protect existing social and economic development gains from
the adverse effect of HIV/AIDS and support sectoral policies, programmes and
activities that impact on the national, community and individual level.

Target aid where it will do good

BYLINE: Joseph Stiglitz; Joseph Stiglitz is senior vice-president and chief
economist of the World Bank in Washington DC

SECTION: FINANCE; Pg. 16

LENGTH: 764 words

HIGHLIGHT: Donors are giving up on aid, but Joseph Stiglitz argues that it can
benefit countries that are well-run


FOREIGN aid is at an all-time low.  More than 50 years after the "aid era" began
with the Marshall Plan in 1947, development assistance has tumbled to less than
a quarter of 1 per cent of major donors' gross national product, the smallest
share ever.

Among the reasons for this drop, one stands out: the assumption that aid does
not work very well.

It is true that aid has been an unmitigated failure under some conditions, but
it has been a spectacular success in others.

A new World Bank report, Assessing Aid, aims to show how development assistance
can be used more effectively, by understanding why aid works well in Bolivia or
Uganda, for example, but has little or no impact in Nigeria or Zambia.

Rather than starting with the question "does aid work?", Assessing Aid begins
with "when does aid work best?" The answer is needed urgently.  Despite great
strides in poverty reduction in the past 50 years, more than a billion people
still live in extreme poverty -- on less than $ 1 a day.  Even more lack basic
services such as clean water, sanitation, electricity and schooling.

This new focus on the circumstances under which aid works changes the nature of
the debate.  Rather than arguing for more aid or less assistance, Assessing Aid
suggests that donors should concentrate on providing more effective aid.

Assessing Aid finds foreign aid has the strongest impact on growth in developing
countries with sound policies and institutions -- for example, macroeconomic
stability, openness to trade, secure property rights, absence of corruption, to
name a few important ones.  In countries with poor policies -- that is, with
poor incentives for production -- financial aid has a much weaker impact.  To
maximise poverty reduction, financial aid should favour countries such as India,
Ethiopia and Uganda, which are poor and have sound economic policies.  Because
nearly 7 per cent of the world's poor live in countries with sound policy
environments, targeting assistance to these countries would have a tremendous
impact on global poverty.

Yet in 1996 donors gave only small amounts of assistance to countries with good
policies.  Reformist countries such as Ethiopia or Uganda received less aid per
capita than poor countries with weak policies.  Rather than rushing in alongside
policy reforms, aid seems to taper out as reforms are adopted.

Opponents of foreign aid may argue that Assessing Aid, by exploring how to use
aid more effectively, gives license to donors to decrease their aid budgets.  In
fact, the report encourages donors to contribute more aid where it will have the
most impact.  Increasing aid to countries which can use it effectively has very
real consequences for the poor.  For example, allocating $ 10 billion in aid
under the current system would lift about 7 million people per year out of
poverty.  But if the same amount of money were targeted at poor countries with
sound economic policies, the number of people to leave the ranks of the poor
would be about 25 million.

So why don't countries end foreign aid to poor countries with bad policies?  One
reason is that donors hope that aid will induce policy reform.  Unfortunately,
money has proved to be ineffective in generating reform.  Zambia is a typical
example.  Foreign aid increased steadily -- reaching 11 per cent of real GDP in
the early 1990s.  Policy, however, got worse throughout this period.  Despite a
series of loans from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, there
was no real improvement in policy until a new government came to power in the
early 1990s.

In these difficult environments, effective assistance must encompass more than
just money or projects.  It must also focus on ideas or knowledge creation.  The
ideas side of aid is critical for helping countries reform and helping
communities provide effective public services such as education, health, and
water.

Vietnam is one success strory.  It initiated a homegrown reform programme in the
1980s.  Sweden and the United Nations Development Programme provided policy
advice and by 1998 the poverty rate had fallen to 30 per cent of households from
55 per cent in 1992.  The country's experience is part of a worldwide trend in
the 1990s toward economic reform that has enabled a large number of countries to
use financial assistance to reduce poverty.

When aid is used to champion reform at the local and national level, to create
the knowledge necessary for effective development and to engage civil society in
the reform process, it can dramatically improve the lives of the poor.

Death toll from AIDS accelerating around world: Memorial services held in
atmosphere of renewed vigour

SOURCE: The Canadian Press

SECTION: CANADA & WORLD; Pg. B4

LENGTH: 666 words


World AIDS Day was marked with renewed vigour around the world yesterday, after
a UN agency reported an accelerating death toll.

Almost one-quarter of the 6.4 million AIDS deaths to date have occurred in the
last year.

In 1996, 3.1 million people were infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS,
bringing the total number of people with HIV or AIDS to 22.6 million, UNAIDS
said.

To mark the day, Health Minister David Dingwall announced several projects will
be funded under Canada's National AIDS Strategy.

They include:

- $100,000 to the Persons Living with HIV-AIDS Network of Saskatchewan to link
the services of the agency with caregivers and families.

- $202,665 to the Council of Ministers of Education Canada for a national study
on school-based and linked programs, policies and services related to HIV-AIDS,
sexually transmitted diseases and sexuality.

Elsewhere in Canada, MuchMusic broadcast the documentary A Time for Mercy.
Produced by AIDS Calgary, the film tells the story of three teenagers affected
by HIV-AIDS. TVOntario, Vision TV and the federal government launched a video
entitled Breaking the Silence about the impact of HIV-AIDS on girls and women.

OPEN HOUSE

The Community AIDS Treatment Information Exchange in Toronto celebrated its
first anniversary with an open house.

In Winnipeg, a memorial walk to the Manitoba legislature and a special service
were planned.

In China, activists posted photos of an emaciated AIDS victim in Beijing's
central Zhongshan Park, along with posters that read: "The risks of careless sex
and lifestyle hygiene."

Health officials warned more than one million Chinese -- 10 times the estimated
current number -- could be infected with HIV by 2000 if preventive measures are
not taken.

In Thailand, a hotbed of prostitution, gas stations distributed three million
condoms to customers with the warning: "Be careful of AIDS when feeling
naughty."

The Health Ministry and state-owned Petroleum Authority of Thailand sponsored
the program. An estimated 800,000 of Thailand's 60 million people have HIV and
50,000 more have died of AIDS.

In the Philippine capital Manila, about 250 government officials, activists and
at least four HIV patients joined in the First National AIDS Walk.

In Taipei, a Taiwanese AIDS-awareness group displayed memorial quilt patches to
honour victims of the disease.

Photo exhibitions carried the message in India, which volunteer organizations
said has Asia's worst AIDS epidemic, with an estimated one million or more HIV
cases. Charity organizations sponsored marches in Bombay.

More than 400 people gathered in Tokyo for the lighting of a tree bearing 12,000
red ribbons, symbol of the fight against AIDS.

EPIDEMIC

In Paris, several hundred AIDS activists marched with signs reading: AIDS: The
Epidemic Isn't Over and Zero Equals the Number of AIDS Survivors.

In Rome, two taxi companies distributed AIDS information leaflets to passengers
and included similar messages on their telephone-answering service. Some players
in Italy's top soccer league wore red ribbons on their uniforms.

Dozens of candles were lit at Madrid's Puerta de Alcala monument in memory of
the estimated 5,000 AIDS victims to have died in the Spanish capital since 1981.

In South Africa, retired Anglican archbishop Desmond Tutu, who won the Nobel
Peace Prize in 1984 for his fight against apartheid, appeared in a TV
advertisement to warn: "Our wonderful country faces a major crisis with HIV and
AIDS spreading so fast. Please use a condom!"

Most of Africa ignored World AIDS Day. Nearly 65 per cent of the world's AIDS
cases live in Africa, believed to be the original home of the disease.

Those trying to fight AIDS in Africa say their work is hampered by ignorance and
deep-seated beliefs about sex.

"A lot of our work is trying to destroy myths and misconceptions," said Andrew
Hobbs, a volunteer with an AIDS project in Zambia.

AIDS has cut life expectancy by 10 years in Uganda.

After years of no news and bad news in AIDS research, the field is suddenly
alive with new developments and breakthroughs.

The most powerful drugs to date ---protease inhibitors ---came on the market in
the past 12 months. More drugs are in the works, and new tests have been
developed that plot more precisely the progress of HIV, the AIDS virus, in the
body.

The Internet has a vast array of sites that help in keeping up with study
findings, medical conferences and policy matters. A good place to start is the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National AIDS Clearinghouse. As a
government site, it doesn't delve into advocacy issues such as patients' rights
or high drug prices, but it is the most reliable source of accurate and
up-to-date information about AIDS research.

Click on "treatment information" for a chart of every drug on the market to
treat HIV or AIDS-related infections and complications. There's an essay on
"Quackery and AIDS," and a history of AIDS developments, compiled by the Food
and Drug Administration.

The AIDS Daily Summary has the day's AIDS-related articles from publications
around the nation and an indexed catalog of thousands of articles dating back
several years.

The site also outlines CDC's "Business Responds to AIDS" campaign, designed to
teach employers how not to discriminate against people with HIV/AIDS and how to
educate employees about the disease. And there's a poster gallery, made to look
like a museum, with color displays of educational posters that can be ordered
online.

Several nongovernmental AIDS organizations around the country have reputations
for publishing information that is as accurate as "official" information. For
years, groups such as the Gay Men's Health Crisis in New York have published
newsletters that distill information from medical conferences and medical
journals, and those are also available online. Project Inform, out of San
Francisco, also has a site, as does the newsletter "AIDS Treatment News," and
Poz, a magazine for HIV-positive people. For people with AIDS interested in
finding out about clinical trials, there are two good sites: The most useful is
the National Institutes of Health site. Click on "HIV/AIDS" for details of
ongoing and upcoming studies and phone numbers to call if you're interested in
enrolling. The AIDS Clinical Trial Information Service offers basic information
on what a clinical trial is.

World AIDS Day is Sunday, and there are several sites pertaining to it. The CDC
has a history of the event and what's going on this year. There's also
information on the event at the National AIDS Clearinghouse site. If you want to
take note of World AIDS Day in cyberspace, there's a drive to get people to turn
off graphics on their Web sites on that day.

Push AIDS education

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 10A

LENGTH: 321 words


The world's struggle against AIDS begins at home, and it should start young.

Two reports issued for World AIDS Day today - from the World Health Organization
and The Global AIDS Policy Coalition - stress prevention as key in keeping AIDS'
grim worldwide reach from getting worse.

One approach looks like it's beginning to pay off: aiming prevention education
at young people.

A recent survey of ninth- through 12th-graders from the Centers for Disease
Control found 83% learned about AIDS in school in 1991, up from 54% in 1989. And
81% vs. 54% had talked about AIDS with an adult at home.

At the same time, the percentage of teens who had had sex fell for the first
time in two decades, from 59% to 54%.

That's good news. Abstaining from sex is the best protection against contracting
AIDS. But for sexually active teens, the lessons aren't getting through.

AIDS cases among teen-agers are growing at an alarming clip: up 77% in the past
two years, according to the CDC. More than 9,000 are infected nationwide. In
addition, many of the 44,000 ages 20-29 who now have AIDS were infected in their
teens.

AIDS is now the sixth leading cause of death among those ages 15-24.

To reach this group, AIDS education needs to be explicit about the risks and how
to avoid them. That means providing graphic information about condoms, now used
by fewer than half of sexually active teens, and making the condoms themselves
available in schools.

Contracting AIDS is a cruel way to learn a lesson that could have been taught in
class.

What teen-agers say about AIDS

In a survey of 2,100 high school seniors, the percent saying:
  -- Students with AIDS should be allowed in school    89%
-- Condoms should be available in school             81%
-- Should be AIDS testing in school                  49%

How Much Does Uncle Sam Spend on AIDS?;
It All Depends on How You Play the Numbers

Don Colburn, Washington Post Staff Writer

SECTION: HEALTH; PAGE Z7

LENGTH: 1292 words


Does the federal government spend more money on AIDS than on cancer -- or much
less? Or about the same amount? The answer, in this political season, is: Any of
the above, depending on how the numbers are calculated and spun.

During the first presidential debate, President Bush was asked, in light of
recurrent demonstrations outside the White House and the angry resignation of
AIDS Commission member Magic Johnson, "Where is this widespread feeling coming
from that your administration is not doing enough about AIDS?" Bush attributed
the criticism to "the political process" and then cited some AIDS funding
figures.

"We have increased funding for AIDS," Bush said. "We've doubled it on research
and on every other aspect of it. My request for this year was $ 4.9 billion for
AIDS, 10 times as much per AIDS victim as per cancer victim."

But both the total spending figure the president cited and the comparison he
drew with cancer have been challenged by AIDS experts and advocacy groups. Asked
to explain where the president's figures came from, the White House referred the
question to the Bush-Quayle reelection campaign, which in turn referred it to
the Department of Health and Human Services.

The $ 4.9 billion figure represents a lump-sum estimate of total federal
spending on AIDS in the Bush administration's fiscal 1993 budget request. It
includes not only funds for AIDS research and prevention but every federal
dollar spent on treatment of AIDS patients covered by so-called "entitlement"
programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and other health, disability and veterans
benefit plans.

For example, if a veteran with AIDS goes to the hospital, the health benefits he
or she receives as a veteran are counted in the Bush AIDS spending estimate. But
if the same veteran goes to the hospital for treatment of cancer, those health
benefits are not counted in the federal cancer budget. They are simply part of
the Veterans Affairs budget.

AIDS is the only disease the Bush administration has tallied in this way. There
is no comparable figure for total federal spending on cancer or heart disease or
diabetes or any other illness -- no number to measure directly against the $ 4.9
billion Bush cited as total federal spending on AIDS.

"It does not exist at this time. No one collects that data yet," said Donald C.
Poppke, chief of the public health branch in HHS's division of health and social
services budget analysis.

Federal agencies have been asked to come up with comparable figures for other
diseases, Poppke said. "We're hoping to have that by January."

In the meantime, some AIDS experts say it is misleading for Bush to use the $
4.9 billion figure when spending for no other disease is calculated that way.

"It has no precedent," said June E. Osborn, dean of the University of Michigan
School of Public Health who chairs the National Commission on AIDS. "It's a
numbers game that has a very troubling side to it."

Other leading killers -- heart disease, stroke, many forms of cancer -- show a
slight decline over the past decade, Osborn said, because "three or four decades
of research in those fields is now beginning to pay off."

But the AIDS epidemic, barely a decade old, is "out of control," she said. "A
vaccine is years away. There's no cure in sight. Treatments are inadequate.
[Any] idea that we've done enough on AIDS -- that whole line of reasoning is
very troubling. We wouldn't have said that about polio three years before the
Salk vaccine."

As for the president's statement that the federal government spends 10 times as
much "per victim" on AIDS as on cancer, Osborn said she opposes "the
disease-specific approach" to health care. What needs more attention, she said,
are the common problems that many chronically ill Americans share, whether they
are sick from AIDS, cancer, diabetes or stroke. Chronic, primary and preventive
care is "the part of our health care system that is most ragged," Osborn said.

Comparing one disease with another in terms of the amount spent on it is fraught
with difficulty, HHS's Poppke said. It tends to assume that all diseases are
more or less equal in terms of their impact on public health.

AIDS differs from other diseases in several key respects. It is a relatively new
disease that is spreading at an alarming rate. It is overwhelmingly a disease of
young people and also strikes minorities and the poor disproportionately. It is
incurable, though an infected person may not develop symptoms for a decade and
may survive for years after diagnosis. It is an infectious, sexually transmitted
disease whose spread can be prevented by precautions such as use of condoms by
the sexually active and clean needles by those who inject drugs.

It is those kinds of differences that policy makers must take into consideration
when deciding how much to spend on a given disease and how to target that
spending, Poppke said. The onslaught of AIDS over the past decade has put a huge
new burden on already strapped public health budgets in Washington and around
the nation.

"There are people on both sides of the issue who feel very strongly -- and for
valid reasons," Poppke said.

Cancer is expected to kill about 520,000 Americans, about 1 percent more than
last year. AIDS is projected to kill one tenth as many -- between 45,000 and
57,000 -- but the toll is doubling every few years.

Since about 10 times as many Americans will die of cancer as of AIDS this year,
the "per victim" research budget would differ by 10-fold even if the total
budgets for the two diseases were the same. The administration's 1993 budget
requested $ 1.95 billion for cancer research and $ 1.31 billion for AIDS
research. If the administration calculated total federal spending on cancer the
way it has on AIDS, the cancer total would dwarf the AIDS total.

"We think all diseases -- not just AIDS -- ought to get more money," said
Jeffrey Levi, director of government affairs for the AIDS Action Council, a
lobbying group representing more than 800 AIDS service organizations from around
the country. "We're not saying cancer is getting too much money. Nothing is
gained by these comparisons."

President Bush said his administration had doubled funding for research on AIDS
"and on every other aspect of it." But most of the increase has come in
entitlement programs such as Medicaid and Medicare, whose spending rises
automatically with increased demand. The more AIDS patients, the more demand.

The AIDS Action Council notes that the administration's 1993 request for AIDS
research at the National Institutes of Health was $ 873 million, an increase of
3.8 percent over the previous year -- not enough to keep up with the biomedical
inflation rate of about 5 percent. During the four years of the Bush
administration, the council said, discretionary spending on AIDS -- research,
prevention and treatment -- has risen from $ 1.6 billion to $ 2.1 billion, while
spending on AIDS research alone has risen 17 percent.

The federal research effort against AIDS has been massive. But because of the
complexity of the AIDS virus, a magic-bullet vaccine remains a long shot, while
more and more patients need care in the front lines of the war on AIDS.

The very increases in AIDS spending cited by President Bush are turned against
the administration by its critics as evidence that the war is being lost.
"Entitlement spending reflects our nation's failure to prevent the transmission
of HIV, and our failure to find workable treatments," said Daniel T. Bross,
executive director of the AIDS Action Council, in a statement issued after the
first presidential debate.

"The reason it's doubling, of course," said the AIDS Commission's Osborn, "is
that so many people have AIDS."

Editorial;
Firms Must Help Combat AIDS

SECTION: Pg. 6

LENGTH: 561 words


The spread of AIDS is accelerating rapidly in Japan. The AIDS Surveillance
Committee of the Health and Welfare Ministry reported that there were 226 new
cases identified this year through June; the total for all of last year was 238.

Considering that only about 10 percent of this year's cases had been previously
reported as carriers of the virus that causes AIDS, the actual number of people
who have the disease or carry the virus may be 10 times greater than the number
of cases reported.

Japan cannot afford to take the disease lightly. Individuals have the
responsibility to take precautions to prevent themselves from contacting AIDS,
but at the same time the nation must promote education about the disease and
develop remedies to stop its spread.

Japanese businesses that send employees abroad are already taking
countermeasures.

Variety Of Responses

The Tokyo Chamber of Commer-ce and Industry has established a 20-member AIDS
committee of medical professionals and business executives to study the
initiatives taken by various firms. The committee has met several times and
found that different firms have taken a variety of measures. Some companies give
lectures on AIDS to employees who are being posted abroad. Other firms give out
disposable needles and condoms. Some companies are doing nothing because they
feel that AIDS is a personal matter.

The committee plans to produce a manual about AIDS and distribute copies free to
Japanese companies.

The first step in fighting AIDS is to inform employees about AIDS, including
telling them how the virus can and cannot be spread. All employees, even those
not going abroad, should learn how the virus can be passed from one person to
another.

Dealing With AIDS Patients

Secondly, employees should be taught not to panic if one of their colleagues is
found to be infected with the AIDS virus or to have developed AIDS. Company
presidents, and executives in charge of personnel and health care should
introduce AIDS-infected people or virus carriers to medical institutions and
give advice on their work situation.

According to Yukihiro Matsuya-ma, committee member and a researcher at Sumitomo
Life Insurance Research Institute, for several years after the disease was first
diagnosed, those known to be affected by AIDS or the virus became segregated,
even in the United States. In one case, 500 company employees quit, one after
the other, when it became known that one employee had been diagnosed with AIDS
and the company's business was affected. But later a law to protect AIDS
patients and virus carriers was enacted and the court has ruled in support of
the AIDS patients in a number of cases. As a result, few AIDS patients have been
forced to quit or have been transferred to other work places.

At an international AIDS conference in the Netherlands in July, there were 1
million new cases of virus carriers in the first half of this year. The AIDS
epidemic is rapidly spreading, particularly in Asia. We hope that companies that
have plants overseas or those that send employees abroad will cooperate fully
with local authorities to prevent the spread of AIDS.

Companies must take steps to fight AIDS, not only to prevent the loss of
valuable employees, but also to display a positive attitude and to help the
world fight AIDS.

Place responsibility for AIDS where it belongs

BYLINE: Charles Krauthammerdisease; health; care; personnel; tests; regulations

SECTION: EDITORIAL; SECTION A; PAGE 19

LENGTH: 557 words


Washington - Kimberly Bergalis, 23 years old and dying of AIDS, came to
Washington last week on a crusade. She contracted AIDS from her dentist and
wants Congress to impose mandatory AIDS testing for medical workers.

Kimberly's story is moving. But mandatory testing is a terrible idea. In the
entire history of AIDS there is but a single case of a doctor giving AIDS to his
patients (Kimberly's dentist). A million Americans carry the HIV virus. Five got
it from medical workers. (All from Kimberly's dentist.)

The American Hospital Association estimates that it would cost $ 250 million
every year to test American health-care workers. To save five patients per
decade? However heartbreaking Kimberly's story, this is insane public policy.

Kimberly's crusade is so obviously misguided that her story risks being
dismissed as a mere tragic aberration. But there is a far deeper meaning to Ms.
Bergalis: It has to do with taking responsibility for the spread of AIDS.

Ms. Bergalis is the first politically incorrect AIDS victim. Instead of hurling
"J'accuse" at George Bush or Cardinal O'Connor or a bigoted citizenry, she
hurled it at another AIDS victim and, by implication, at the entire AIDS
community: You killed me.

Which is why she has been shunned by mainstream gay-rights and AIDS activists.

In the public mind, the allocation of blame for AIDS has seen three stages. When
the cause of AIDS first became known, AIDS patients were seen as victims of
their own appetites. Then, with Ryan White, the young hemophiliac, they began to
be seen as victims of fate. Now, AIDS activists are trying to portray AIDS
patients as the victims of society: of an indifferent majority, of public
silence, of government inaction, of drug-company avarice.

Ms. Bergalis reminds the country that for every person who gets HIV, there is an
HIV carrier who gave it to her. Generally, the transmission is unwitting. But
not always. A study of HIV carriers published in the current issue of the
American Journal of Public Health found that 52 percent of those who were
sexually active had concealed their condition from a sexual partner.

Some epidemics can be laid at the feet of government and some cannot. In a free
society, government can do little to influence the spread of a behavioral
epidemic, and AIDS is the quintessential behavioral epidemic.

In a country where the right to choose and the right to privacy are singularly
cherished, it is absurd to blame government for a disease that spreads through
the most private of acts in the most intimate of settings.

The main role of government is to protect the civil rights of AIDS sufferers and
to try to find a cure. The rest depends on the private decisions of individual
citizens and of the only ones in a position to spread AIDS: HIV carriers.

Kimberly's case brought home a truth as biologically obvious as it is
politically unfashionable: HIV is spread by people who already have HIV.

Thus, in the absence of effective treatment, the most effective curb on the
spread of AIDS is an ethic of responsibility among HIV sufferers. Reveal or
refrain: Either reveal one's status to those one might infect or refrain from
any behavior that might lead someone else unwittingly to contract it.

Mr. Krauthammer writes for The Washington Post.

The ins and outs of sound systems; Hearing aids; Health

SECTION: Issue 63319.

LENGTH: 715 words


According to the Institute of Hearing Research in Nottingham, one in 11 adults
(3.9 million) in Britain have a hearing loss which could benefit from hearing
aids. One dispenser of hearing aids claims that the figure is closer to seven
million. Approximately 1.5 million people currently have hearing aids; recent
surveys show that 30 per cent of users rarely wear their aids.

All hearing aids contain the same basic components a microphone which converts
sound to electrical signals, an amplifier, an earphone to convert the signals
back to sounds, battery and volume control, plus, on post-aural aids, a vinyl or
acrylic ear mould connected to the ear piece by a plastic tube. Last year
200,000 post-aural aids were issued to new patients by the National Health
central purchasing centre. Approximately 20 per cent of hearing aids are bought
privately, with 80,000 sold last year (up to 70 per cent were in-the-ear
devices).


Hearing aids are made specially for the NHS by manufacturers which also supply
the private sector. Fourteen different models for different degrees of hearing
loss are supplied by the NHS. One advantage of private aids, according to Brian
Grover, head of Scientific and Technical Services at the RNID, is the
availability of a wider range of adjustments and facilities such as audio-input
and automatic volume control. However, it is debatable how many of these
adjustments, a great selling point in the private sector, are actually needed by
the majority of users.

Post-aural aids are supplied to the NHS at a cost of about Pounds 25 each.
Equivalent aids bought privately cost over Pounds 300. The NHS does not supply
in-the-ear hearing aids. If it did bulk buy in-the-ear aids, one which cost
Pounds 500 to buy privately might not cost much more than about Pounds 50.
Bought privately, a Pounds 500 hearing aid would probably cost the dispenser
between Pounds 100-Pounds 150. Most dispensers sell an average of three hearing
aids a week.

There are about 650 dispensers (who fit and sell hearing aids) in this country,
who have to be registered with the Hearing Aid Council. The Hearing Aid Council
Amendments Bill was drawn up by MPs Ieuan Wyn Jones and Jack Ashley and proposed
to Parliament last Friday; an objection by Barry Porter, MP for Wirral South,
and parliamentary adviser to the Hearing Aid Association, stopped its progress.
The Bill aims to change the balance of the Hearing Aid Council to equal
representation for consumers (at present there are six trade members to five
consumers); it also wants to increase the disciplinary powers of the council and
to make a breach of the code of practice a disciplinary offence.

While researching the Bill, Wyn Jones received more than 200 complaints relating
to sales techniques involving coupon advertising and doorstep salesmen. These
doorstep sales techniques contravene the industry's own code of conduct, under
which the potential customer should not be visited within 10 days of sending off
the enquiry coupon, and should be given the opportunity to refuse a visit.

Hearing aids bought privately cost between Pounds 300 and Pounds 1,000 each.
They need to be replaced every three to five years, and batteries only last a
week or two. Health insurance does not cover private hearing aids. National
Health hearing aids are technically 'on loan', but if they break down they are
serviced, or replaced. Batteries are supplied free.

Advantages of in-the-ear models are largely cosmetic. Though in general they are
only suitable for mild to moderate losses, Grover considers that their acoustic
qualities may be slightly better because the sound does not have to travel down
a plastic tube as it does in the post-aural aid. The most popular kind of
in-the-ear aid is made to fit the individual ear, whereas some of the very tiny
ones are a standard fitting which may not suit everybody's ear canal: if a
hearing aid does not fit snugly it will cause acoustic feedback (a high

A modular in-the-ear aid which has the electronics in a standard casing fitted
to an individual ear mould is popular in Europe. Grover believes this type would
be practical if the NHS were to consider offering in-the-ear aids. But, for the
moment, the NHS seems to have no such plans.

Reinventing Foreign Aid

LENGTH: 812  words


Reinventing Foreign Aid. Edited by William Easterly. The MIT Press. 537pp, £
48.95 and £ 22.95. ISBN 9780262050906 and 550666. Published 25 July 2008

Sixty years after it started, foreign aid has become a debating matter once
again. As sharply as ever before, opinion is deeply divided about whether or not
aid works. For the optimists, aid is viewed as the necessary means for
transforming the world's poorest and most backward economies, ultimately making
global poverty history. For the sceptics, however, the record of aid over the
past six decades of its existence has been disappointing.

One of the greatest problems with knowing which side of the intellectual divide
is right is the absence of any comprehensive evidence about whether aid works or
not.

As is well known, this is because of the familiar counterfactual problem -
knowing what would have happened in particular countries if aid had not been
given. As this book claims, however, the absence of such evidence should make us
cautious in making over-grandiose claims for aid or building over-optimistic
expectations about what it can achieve. The book is edited by the renowned aid
scholar and author Bill Easterly, with a foreword by Nancy Birdsall, president
of the Centre for Global Development in Washington, and chapters written by a
wide range of mostly American scholars and practitioners.

In the opening chapter, Easterly distinguishes between two intellectual schools
in the aid debate - the "planners" and the "searchers". The planners are defined
as those who place great confidence in the ability of aid to transform countries
and who set bold, predetermined goals for channelling large financial resources
into these countries within the framework of a big plan, and accompanied by a
large administrative apparatus. The searchers, on the other hand, are defined as
those who adopt a more cautious, piecemeal approach, trying to find particular
solutions to specific problems by means of trial and error and the feedback of
information.

The early chapters of the book contain an appeal for more evidence-based
policymaking in the development field. More specifically, the case is presented
for making more use of randomised controlled trials to identify aid
interventions that work and are cost-effective.

The authors see this as an attempt to mimic the trials that are carried out on
new drugs before they are put on the market for sale to the public. In short,
before vast sums of money are committed to a particular aid programme, we need
to gather evidence about what works - a seemingly obvious requirement but one
that is mostly ignored in aid-giving.

As a later chapter argues, however, one of the problems with a rigorous approach
to evaluating different forms of aid giving is that aid donors may have a vested
interest in concealing the results of such an exercise. Indeed, a log-rolling
process may even develop where different aid-givers enter into an informal
agreement not to subject each other's programme to rigorous evaluation. This may
explain why such evaluations are rare.

Another important issue in the current debate about aid effectiveness concerns
the relationship between the aid donor and the recipient state. Where good
governance is absent in the recipient country, aid givers may be tempted to
bypass the government of the recipient state and funnel aid directly to the
targeted population. While this may result in aid more effectively reaching the
people it is designed to help, it may undermine the sovereignty of the host
government and hold back the development of the state.

This is all linked with the role played by aid-giving in the process of
state-building in poor countries. Far from aid bringing about improved
governance, aid may merely serve to reinforce patrimony, patronage and
rent-seeking. A culture of aid dependency is created and sustained by the
relationship that grows up between aid donors and government officials in the
local state. Governments in recipient states become dependent on aid for
revenues, leading to reduced accountability of the governing elite and
underperformance in policy.

The purpose of this book is not simply to criticise aid-giving over the past 60
years. Rather, it aims to make it more effective. This means avoiding
comprehensive blueprints, which reduce the solution to the problem of poverty to
single-shock therapy. It means trying different measures to see if they work,
but not assuming that the same approach will work equally well in all countries.
As Easterly claims, this is the language of what the great philosopher Karl
Popper called "piecemeal democratic reform" in contrast with "utopian social
engineering".

There is a lot in this book for all those involved with development issues to
absorb and think about.

Radical group takes over AIDS conference; Protesters say government assistance
limited to creating a bureaucracy

BYLINE: KATE DUNN; GAZETTE

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A3

LENGTH: 402 words


Blowing whistles and storming the stage, the radical AIDS activist group ACT-UP
took over a government-sponsored AIDS conference yesterday to demand the
resignation of the province's senior AIDS bureaucrat.

About 17 ACT-UP members rushed onto the stage. A black ACT-UP banner was
unfurled while a group member, Daniel Begin, read the group's manifesto. Denise
Laberge-Ferron, director of the Quebec Centre for AIDS Co-ordination, stood
stoically behind Begin on the platform as he called for her resignation. Begin
said not enough is being done to prevent the spread of human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV).

In an interview, he called Laberge-Ferron "a government lackey."

"All the government has done in responding to the AIDS epidemic is to create a
new bureaucracy," he said.

Yesterday was World AIDS Day.

After the ACT-UP demonstration, Laberge-Ferron told the audience about the
centre's efforts at training health and social workers in AIDS prevention.

In an interview, she said a new government program will provide free or
subsidized drugs to 83 per cent of Quebecers with AIDS.

ACT-UP (Aids Coalition to Unleash Power) wants the province to pay for all drugs
and protein supplements needed by people with HIV/AIDS.

Last Thursday Health and Social Services Minister Marc-Yvan Cote announced $ 11
million in funding to cover the cost of a number of AIDS drugs. As well, people
with AIDS-related cancer or tuberculosis will qualify for an existing program
that subsidizes drug costs to keep patients relatively healthy and and out of
hospital.

ACT-UP member Michael Hendricks said the $ 11 million drug program is only for
people with AIDS, not those with HIV, which is linked to AIDS. People with the
virus can use expensive drugs to stem the decline in their immune systems that
leads to AIDS.

"The drugs prolong life and keep people out of the hospital," said Hendricks.
"If you can't afford the drugs but don't have full-blown AIDS, which would allow
you to qualify for free drugs, you'll go on welfare because welfare provides the
drugs for free."

Laberge-Ferron said the drug program does apply to people with HIV. However, the
minister's press release mentions only people with AIDS.

As of November 15, there were 1,789 cases of AIDS in Quebec, said Dr. Robert
Remis, chief of infectious diseases for a coalition of community health
departments in the Montreal region.

Belinda Mason, 33, U.S. Panelist And Bush Adviser on AIDS Policy

BYLINE: By PHILIP J. HILTS,  Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 9


Belinda Mason, a member of the National Commission on AIDS who pleaded with
President Bush in a letter in August not to support proposed Federal policies
that she said would further stigmatize AIDS sufferers, died this morning at
Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville. She was 33 years old.

She died of AIDS-related pneumonia, a spokesman for the commission said.

Ms. Mason was infected with the virus that causes AIDS when she received a blood
transfusion in 1987 while giving birth to her second child. Hospital workers had
not tested the blood she received, but later found that it was contaminated with
the AIDS virus.

Before she became infected, Ms. Mason worked as a reporter for two weekly
newspapers, The Ohio County Times-News in Hartford, Ky., and later for The
Appalachian News-Express in Pikeville, Ky. She also wrote short stories.

When she learned she was infected with AIDS, she became an advocate for better
medical and social treatment of people with the AIDS virus. Ms. Mason founded
Kentuckiana People With AIDS Coalition, the first Kentucky-based advocacy
organization for those stricken with AIDS.

'An AIDS Poster Child'

She later became president of the National Association of People With AIDS and
was appointed by President Bush to the National Commission on AIDS in 1990.

"I have become the disease," she said in an interview six weeks ago. "When
people talk to me now, they see the disease first. Nobody talks to Belinda Mason
the short-story writer anymore. My previous identity has dissolved. I've become
an AIDS poster child."

In her letter to Mr. Bush on Aug. 2 she said she had no ill will toward
health-care workers even though she contracted the disease through their lapses.
She also said she opposed widespread compulsory testing of such workers. Nor,
she wrote, did she want people with AIDS to be barred from entering the United
States. Both proposals are being considered in Washington.

"Mr. President, doctors don't give people AIDS -- they care for people with it,"
she wrote. "The blanket screening of health-care workers will create the false
illusion that people with AIDS are a threat to others."

Ms. Mason is survived by her husband, Stephen Carden, and their two children,
Polly, 8, and Clayton, 4. She will be buried on their Kentucky farm.

Advances In Treatment Change Face Of AIDS

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN

SECTION: Section C; Page 1, Column 1; Science Desk

LENGTH: 2032 words


THE array of infections that strike people with AIDS is undergoing a profound
shift that will affect patients, their doctors and the ability of the health
care system to cope with the rising number of AIDS cases.

In gains already made against the disease, drugs are helping people live months
or even years longer and are gradually controlling the pneumonia that was
originally the most devastating infection to strike AIDS patients.

But this progress has led to a new plateau of complications. During the precious
extra time granted them, more people with AIDS are now falling prey to several
cancers and a bewildering array of secondary infections that most victims in the
earlier stages of the epidemic did not live to get. Most of these infections
were seen in some patients early in the epidemic but are now emerging in greater
force. However, some infections are taking on puzzling forms that pose a wholly
new challenge to the medical profession.

Since AIDS first appeared in 1981, a lung infection, pneumocystis carinii
pneumonia, or PCP, has been the initial condition upon which the diagnosis of
AIDS was usually made. PCP is also the leading cause of death from AIDS.

Now the drug regimens of AZT, aerosolized pentamidine and Bactrim that health
officials have recommended in the last year are staving off many cases of PCP.
When AIDS is now diagnosed, there is a greater chance it is based on a wider
variety of complications.

They include a number of cancers; secondary infections that have a predilection
for patients with weakened immune systems; muscle weakness; nervous system
disorders, and striking levels of wasting. Cytomegalovirus infections of the
eye, which can cause blindness, for example, rose from 0.2 percent as the
initial symptom of AIDS in 1983 to 2.4 percent in 1989, the Federal Centers for
Disease Control in Atlanta said. Wasting increased from 6.6 percent in 1987 to
19.7 percent in 1989.

Pneumocystis and other infections are also changing the way they cause illness
by appearing in unusual patterns and sites in the body.

''AIDS has changed dramatically in the last few months because the strategy of
prescribing prophylactic drug treatment against PCP is working for those who
start treatment early enough,'' said Dr. Merle A. Sande, chief of medicine at
San Francisco General Hospital. ''AIDS is a different disease than it was last
year.''

The new clinical face of AIDS has important implications for patients, doctors
and the health care system. For patients, it is yet another hurdle to overcome
in battling a lethal disease. There is more suffering as some AIDS patients have
developed two or more types of cancer. For doctors, diagnoses can be more
difficult. Sometimes what looks like a spreading infection on X-rays turns out
to be a cancer. The change also has costly implications for the health care
system. The chief factor now complicating treatment of AIDS is an upsurge in
cancer. Nineteen experts interviewed said Kaposi's sarcoma, lymphomas (cancers
of the lymph system) and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin were an important
and growing problem in AIDS.

''AIDS-related cancers are being seen in increasing numbers,'' said Dr. Samuel
A. Broder, head of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Md. ''Cancer is
emerging as the biggest new challenge in the treatment of AIDS.'' He said a
fresh research approach was needed to find effective treatments for the tumors.

Longer Hospital Stays

Patients with AIDS-related cancers and other complications are often very ill
and require prolonged treatment in hospitals with combinations of toxic drugs
that often make them sicker. Many require the skills of teams of specialists in
oncology, infectious disease and other fields.

Thus the AIDS related cancers are likely to lead to more and longer hospital
stays. Such a development will dent, if not reverse, the trend of shorter stays
and increased out-patient treatment that has followed development of improved
therapies for many complications of AIDS.

Dr. David E. Rogers, head of the New York State AIDS Advisory Council and the
Mayor's AIDS Task Force, said the larger number of patients surviving from AIDS
and needing such care was likely to further strain an already overburdened
health care system.

Precise statistics on the incidence of the AIDS-related infections and cancers,
and costs of treatment, are not available because only recently have researchers
begun studies to determine what proportion of AIDS patients develop such
complications.

No one knows, for example, how many people with AIDS also have Kaposi's sarcoma.
Studies show the proportion of Kaposi cases leading to an AIDS diagnosis has
declined since the epidemic began. In New York City, the percentage of Kaposi's
cases among gay men dropped from 49 percent in 1982 to 14 percent in 1989. In
San Francisco, the percentage of lymphoma cases at the time of initial diagnosis
of AIDS rose from 1.3 percent in 1983 to 4.6 percent this year.

Yet none of the experts interviewed could cite any study that determined the
percentage of AIDS patients who had developed Kaposi's sarcoma by the time of
death.

There is a lack of similar data about other complications, including the long
list of AIDS-related opportunistic infections. Among them are bacterial
infections like tuberculosis and mycobacterium avian intracellulare; parasitic
infections like toxoplasmosis, cryptococcosis and histoplamosis; and viral
infections like herpes and cytomegalovirus.

The regimens needed to keep bacterial, fungal and viral infections in check
become more complex every year. ''Juggling the regimens gets more and more
complicated as the immune system fails and the patients develop more of the
opportunistic infections and cancers,'' Dr. Sande said.

A precipitous drop in the frequency of pneumocystis pneumonia as the initial
condition found in AIDS patients was uncovered in a small study begun last year
by Dr. Philip C. Hopewell at San Francisco General Hospital. Of 220 AIDS
-infected people in the group, 21 had developed AIDS by last month. In only 2,
or 10 percent, was pneumocystis pneumonia the initial symptom, as against 60
percent in the past.

A similar but less dramatic decline in pneumocystis pneumonia has occurred
elsewhere in San Francisco, said Dr. George Lemp, an epidemiologist with the San
Francisco Health Department. The percentage of AIDS patients with pneumocystis
pneumonia as their first symptom dropped from 58 percent in 1986 to 42 percent
this year.

But Dr. Lemp said he could not determine what proportion of the decline was due
to success of prophylactic drug treatment and what proportion to changes in the
official definition of an AIDS case in 1987.

Pneumocystis infections remain the leading killer of AIDS patients largely
because many do not receive prophylactic treatment in time because of lack of
access to medical care. The prophylactic regimen fails in about 10 percent of
cases.

PCP Decline in New York

In New York, there has been a drop in the proportion of PCP among all AIDS cases
since 1987, from about 60 to 50 percent, said Dr. Pauline A. Thomas, an
epidemiologist at the New York City Health Department.

Nationally, the frequency of PCP as the first symptom among white homosexual men
has dropped from 62 percent in early 1988 to 52 percent for the first quarter of
1990, said Dr. Ruth L. Berkelman, an AIDS epidemiologist at the Centers for
Disease Control.

Several experts said they were astonished by the way the clinical pattern of
certain infections, including pneumocystis pneumonia, was changing to mimic
other conditions.

Until recently, pneumocystis infections were confined to the lungs and usually
appeared as scattered patches on X-rays of the chest. Now such infections are
occurring outside the lungs. At Northwestern University in Chicago, Dr. John P.
Phair said about 10 percent of the recent cases of pneumocystis infections his
team treated affected organs other than the lungs. The pneumocystis microbe now
sometimes forms the type of cavities that are more typical of tuberculosis.

Several doctors in Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston and Minneapolis say some
pneumocystis infections are not responding to treatment as quickly as they did
in the past. Dr. Jerome E. Groopman, an AIDS expert at the New England Deaconess
Hospital in Boston, said doctors were asking whether strains of the organism
were becoming resistant to antibiotics. But doctors elsewhere said they had not
seen a similar change. Although cancers have been linked to AIDS from the
beginning of the epidemic, experts believe they are now occurring more often in
later stages of the disease.

In San Francisco, Dr. Sande says, ''we were amazed'' to find that cancers
exceeded pneumocystis pneumonia as the initial AIDS symptom. The 10 cases of
Kaposi's sarcoma and 5 of lymphoma led the list. Despite the declining
percentage of Kaposi's sarcoma among AIDS patients, there are more cases of the
cancer now because the total number of AIDS cases is much larger and the Kaposi
cases that develop are often difficult to treat. Dr. Kenrad E. Nelson said many
of the Kaposi cases his Johns Hopkins team was treating were aggressive and
responded poorly to chemotherapy.

Kaposi's sarcoma produces purplish skin lesions that can sometimes fester and be
the source of secondary infections. Because of the inability to control the
infection, such problems have occasionally led to amputations of a leg. Kaposi's
lesions can also damage the lungs and other organs.

Dr. Broder, the Government's chief cancer expert, said, ''About 10 percent of
AIDS patients develop lymphomas, and the numbers will grow as more people
survive longer with the disease.'' He estimated that AIDS-related lymphomas
account for about 10 percent of the 36,000 cases of lymphoma diagnosed in the
United States each year.

But the AIDS-related lymphomas do not behave the way most doctors have been
taught because they appear in and spread to unusual sites. The usual types of
lymphomas typically affect the nodes in the lymph system. But the AIDS-related
lymphomas, known as non-Hodgkins lymphomas, tend to appear anywhere in the body,
including the brain.

''They can be a real diagnostic challenge, requiring a high level of medical
skill,'' Dr. Broder said.

Drugs as Suspects

Some doctors have questioned whether anti-AIDS drugs are contributing to the
development of AIDS-related cancers. Dr. Broder said researchers were looking
into the issue, though he doubted that there was a link.

''We have known for years that chronic immune destruction is a predisposing
factor that provides the soil in which lymphomas can grow, and that is the most
likely explanation,'' Dr. Broder said. Such tumors have been reported among
patients with congenital immune deficiency disorders and recipients of
transplanted kidneys and other organs.

But Dr. Broder added, ''You cannot rule out the possibility that there is a
carcinogenic effect from the AIDS drugs.''

Dr. Groopman, the Boston expert, said that until a link between AIDS drugs and
lymphomas is made, ''it would be a mistake for AIDS-infected individuals to
avoid taking AZT on the supposition that they might get lymphoma in 5 to 10
years.''

The challenge to develop new treatments for AIDS-related lymphomas is
particularly difficult because these cancers do not respond as well to the
combination of drugs used to treat other cancers of the lymph system. One reason
for the poorer results is that such patients have two lethal diseases: AIDS and
the lymphoma.

One new strategy being tested is to use smaller amounts of chemotherapy to help
reduce the serious toxic reactions. Another is to add new drugs so they can
promote the growth of blood cells to help the bone marrow make larger numbers of
infection-fighting cells that AIDS patients need to take to combat the AIDS
virus and complications from the disease. Many toxic reactions destroy white
cells and thus limit the amount of anti-cancer drugs that can be given and thus
their effectiveness.

Over all, Dr. Bernard of Memorial Sloan-Kettering said: ''We see progress. But
the bottom line still is not a happy one.''

Why is foreign aid an easy target?

LENGTH: 891 words

DATELINE: Dhaka


Dhaka, March 29 -- There was a sense of deja vu among Australians watching the
news of U.S. President Donald Trump's plan to slash funding for the U.S. Agency
for International Development and United Nations.

Just as Trump promised voters that foreign spending would take a back seat, so
too had Tony Abbott, who won the 2013 election for prime minister with a vow to
chop Australia's foreign aid budget. Over the next two years, 11 billion
Australian dollars ($8.3 billion) was cut from Australian support for programs
in developing countries.

In Australia, the development sector has been strong in their opposition to the
cuts. In the U.S., the development sector is beginning to fight back. But will
it be enough?

Parallels between Australia and the U.S. reveal that for many voters, foreign
aid is an easy cut. Devex reveals why and the important role nongovernmental
organizations will play in creating change.

Australia's aid cuts were justified by former Treasurer Joe Hockey as necessary
to build a stronger nation. "We can't continue to fund a massive increase in
foreign aid at the expense of investment in the Australian economy," he told
media at the time. NGOs and supporters of aid spoke out against Australia's
cuts, but on the whole, Australian voters remained largely silent. Budget talk
largely focused on issues associated with public health, housing affordability,
cost of living and social welfare.

"Charity begins at home" was a common cry heard from supporters of cuts at the
time, and a 2015 survey by Essential Media found that Australians on the whole
believed too much was being spent on foreign aid. For U.S. voters calling to
"make America great again," foreign aid could similarly be an easy and obvious
budget cut.

Gaps in aid awareness

Research in both Australia and the U.S. demonstrate that cuts play off a
fundamental lack of awareness and education on foreign aid.

In 2011, research from the Lowy Institute found that the Australian public
massively overestimated what proportion of the federal budget went to the aid
program. On average they guessed that 16 percent of the budget is spent on aid,
when at the time it was just 1.3 percent.

And a survey conducted last year on aid spending by the Campaign for Australian
Aid revealed the public still overestimated aid spend, multiplying its true
share of the federal budget (0.9 percent) by approximately 14 times.

For the U.S., the story is similar. Last year research by the Henry J. Kaiser
Family Foundation found that on average respondents assumed that 31 percent of
the budget was spent on foreign aid. Only 3 percent correctly guessed that less
than 1 percent is spent on aid.

Improved communication and engagement with the public, both by the aid program
and aid program partners, is a critical step that needs to be taken to reduce
the severity of future cuts.

Australia's aid program was targeted for heavy budget cuts several years ago
under the Tony Abbott government. Here are some lessons that international NGOs
learned during the process - and how partners of the U.S. Agency for
International Development can start to prepare now.

Australia's aid program appears to be seeing the light at the end of the tunnel
- slight increases are predicted for future budgets in line with total spending.
But Australian politicians still questioning the value of aid today create
further issues in public education.

Foreign Minister Julie Bishop and Senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells,
Australia's minister for international development and the Pacific, are strong
supporters of aid's role in creating regional and global stability and they
recognize the importance of public support for aid stability and growth.

To gain public support, their strategy is to link the work of the aid program to
home.

Bishop and Fierravanti-Wells are encouraging both the aid program and its
partners to communicate stories of aid success. By linking aid activities as
direct responses to Australian concerns of terrorism, disease and economic
prosperity, advocates hope they can sway the Australian public in favor of
foreign aid spending.

Their success may be seen in the May 2017 federal budget.

How should NGOs respond to the aid cuts?

While some may argue that doing good and providing international leadership
should be enough to justify foreign aid spending, this still needs to be
communicated to U.S. voters who may be facing personal economic hardship. And
for Americans who believe almost one-third of the federal budget goes to aid,
there are clear misconceptions that need to be addressed.

Linking aid to individual security, health and prosperity is possibly the
easiest argument to make. The problem for the U.S. is identifying a strong
leader in the current administration who will push to educate and create
awareness. If not, NGOs will need to take leadership on this responsibility.

There is no doubt the road ahead to change perception and create broad public
support for foreign aid will be a long one. It is still a battle Australian NGOs
are fighting and will continue to fight. The U.S. should be no different.

State aid: Commission turns state aid modernisation into action and calls for
better cooperation with Member States to boost growth

LENGTH: 717  words

DATELINE: Brussels


European Union has issued following press release:

The European Commission has for the first time approved state aid evaluation
plans for two different aid schemes in the Czech Republic and the United
Kingdom. It will enable both countries to provide aid of more than [#x20ac]6
billion in total to spur investment and development. The aid schemes can now run
until 2020 without requiring further Commission approval. This was made possible
by the new General Block Exemption Regulation (GBER), which as part of the
Commission's State Aid Modernisation (SAM) Initiative, greatly extended the
scope of aid exempted from prior notification to the Commission.

Commissioner in charge of competition policy, Margrethe Vestager, said at the
High Level State Aid Forum with Member States today, "Evaluating the impact of
large state aid schemes will provide part of the groundwork for designing better
state aid measures. We need to promote good aid, stamp out bad aid and ensure
transparency of where the money goes and what its impact is." Please see the
Commissioner's full speech here.

Evidence collected for the 2014 State aid scoreboard shows that a growing
percentage (now over 80%) of compatible aid measures are going through the GBER,
and can therefore be implemented by Member States immediately, without having to
seek prior approval by the Commission. At the same time, the tailor-made
evaluation plans for large aid schemes ensure that taxpayer money is well spent
on smart aid measures, which contribute to economic growth and do not harm fair
competition.

There is no cause for complacency. As Commissioner Vestager said: "Changing the
state aid rules is only half the battle. One of the key challenges of my mandate
will be to see that State Aid Modernisation is implemented in practice." Today,
the Commissioner proposed a new approach on how the Commission and Member States
can work better together: They should cooperate to ensure that greater
flexibility for Member States to implement aid is balanced by better
cooperation, diligent national controls and more transparency:

The Commission will work with Member States on how to select and design aid for
infrastructure projects with the greatest impact on growth. A working group on
State Aid and infrastructure projects will be set up to share best practice on
designing such projects.
    Member States are invited to present proposals for strengthening national
systems to ensure better State aid compliance, not only through formal checks
but also through pro-active assessment of national measures in fields such as
tax and on sectors in need of restructuring.
    Member States are invited to work with the Commission on a roadmapto improve
transparency to inform citizens where their money has gone. If greater
transparency makes it possible, the Commission would also consider further
reductions in reporting obligations.


Background on State aid evaluation

According to the GBER, aid schemes with an annual budget of more than
[#x20ac]150 million are initially exempted for six months. To be prolonged,
Member States must submit evaluation plans taking into account the specifics of
the individual schemes and in line with clear principles (e.g. on planning, data
collection, evaluation methodologies, evaluator and involvement of
stakeholders). If they fail to do so, they have to notify the scheme for a state
aid assessment by the Commission after expiry of the six-month period. Results
of the evaluations will help design better future schemes. Please see the
Frequently Asked Questions for further information on State aid evaluation.

The Commission assessed the evaluation plans according to principles published
in the Staff Working Document on State Aid Evaluation. An introduction to State
aid evaluation is available in a dedicated Competition Policy brief.

More details on the evaluation plan for the EUR 2.8 billion Czech "Investment
Incentives" and UK ''Regional Growth Fund'' aid scheme (with a preliminary
budget of at least GBP 3.2 billion) can be found on the websites of the Czech
authorities and the UK authorities. The final evaluation reports for both
schemes have to be submitted to the Commission by 30 June 2020.

Kurtis Rahn, 40, AIDS activist

BYLINE: Cato Bass

SECTION: LOCAL NEWS; Pg. 07C

LENGTH: 476 words


Kurtis James Rahn, 40, of Atlanta was a founder and former executive director of
the metro AIDS Survival Project and worked tirelessly on behalf of Atlanta AIDS
service organizations.

The memorial service for Mr. Rahn, who died Saturday of complications from AIDS
at Grady Memorial Hospital, will be held at 7 p.m. May 17 at 191 Howard St. in
Decatur. The body was cremated. Wages & Sons Funeral Home is in charge of
arrangements.

Mr. Rahn was diagnosed with HIV in 1985.

In 1988, he helped found the Atlanta chapter of the AIDS Survival Project,
formerly the National Association of People with AIDS. Mr. Rahn advocated AIDS
patients working to help each other at a time when such ideas were considered
novel.

"Kurt had a unique vision, creating a model for peer support," said Jeff Graham
of Atlanta, executive director of the project.

"At the time, his concepts were considered radical and revolutionary, especially
when few people were willing to openly discuss HIV status."

Mr. Rahn worked to strengthen anti-discrimination practices among employers who
have workers with HIV and AIDS. He testified before the U.S. Senate in support
of AIDS research and treatment and shared the microphone with such celebrities
as Elizabeth Taylor, according to a close friend, Sandra Kolka of Marietta,
finance chairman of ArtCare, an Atlanta group that holds fund-raising art
auctions for AIDS service organizations.

"Kurt pushed himself beyond what was humanly possible," said Ms. Kolka.

A computer graphics designer, Mr. Rahn donated his services to Atlanta AIDS
service organizations. He created art for fund-raisers, such as the 1994 AIDS
Cure Project Art Show at the King Plow Arts Center and the 1990 Atlanta College
of Art's AIDS Art Action.

Mr. Rahn was the first person with AIDS to serve on the board of AID Atlanta and
served on a drug treatment review committee for the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention and the AIDS Research Consortium of Atlanta, which has brought
new drug trials to Atlanta.

He volunteered for Project Open Hand and the Atlanta chapter of the Names
Project, which exhibits quilts around the country bearing the names of those who
died of AIDS complications.

One of Mr. Rahn's closest friends was his hound dog, Eli, who turned up at his
doorstep one day as a puppy. Mr. Rahn believed that the companionship and
support that dogs can provide AIDS patients was important, and he was a
supporter of Pets Are Loving Support, an AIDS service organization that helps
pay food and veterinary bills for dogs belonging to patients.

Survivors include his mother, Francis Campbell of Huntsville, Ala., and a
sister, Leslie Gaidjunas of Alpharetta.

In lieu of flowers, it is requested that contributions be made to Pets Are
Loving Support, 1438 West Peachtree St., N.W., Atlanta, GA 30309-2955.

A RACIAL DISPUTE OVER 'AIDS RIDE' FUNDS IS RESOLVED< A BOYCOTT OF THE
PHILADELPHIA-TO-D.C. EVENT WAS CALLED OFF.< MORE MONEY WILL GO TO MINORITY
PROGRAMS.

BYLINE: Huntly Collins, INQUIRER STAFF WRITER

SECTION: CITY & REGION; Pg. B03

LENGTH: 784 words


A racial dispute that threatened to disrupt a Philadelphia-to-Washington, D.C.,
bike ride to raise money for AIDS has been settled.

The settlement, to be announced today, clears the way for the 250-mile trek to
begin June 21. Organizers hope to raise a total of $5 million for AIDS
organizations in the two cities.

The agreement, brokered by City Health Commissioner Estelle Richman, gives 25
percent of the net proceeds in the Philadelphia area to the Greater Philadelphia
Urban Affairs Coalition, a nonprofit umbrella group.

The coalition, in turn, plans to distribute its share to grassroots AIDS groups
that target programs to minorities. Those groups will have to bid for the funds
on a competitive basis.

James Roberts, the executive director of the Minority AIDS Project of
Philadelphia and Vicinity, said the agreement meets his concerns that a fair
share of the proceeds go to AIDS organizations headed by minorities.

As a result, he said, a threatened boycott of the "AIDS Ride" - and its
corporate sponsor, Tanqueray - has been called off.

Roberts called the agreement symbolic of a new era in AIDS funding. He said it
put minority groups "on a level playing field with other AIDS organizations."

"The sad part is we had to go through all of this to reach a resolution," he
said.

Also getting 25 percent of the proceeds each are the three original
beneficiaries of the ride: ActionAIDS, the AIDS Information Network and
Philadelphia Community Health Alternatives.

The three groups' initial lock on proceeds from the AIDS Ride had been condemned
by Roberts, who said the groups did not adequately represent the city's
minorities with AIDS.

The three groups all have white executive directors. However, a majority of
their clients are minorities, reflecting the demographics of the city's AIDS
epidemic.

"The important thing is that the ride goes on," Richman said. "It will bring
important dollars into the system. We want to encourage as many people as
possible to sponsor someone who is riding."

Ennes Littrell, the executive director of ActionAIDS, the city's largest AIDS
service organization, said she was pleased by the outcome.

"Since last fall, the three beneficiaries have been looking for an equitable
method of distributing a portion of the funds to other AIDS service
organizations, and we are pleased to have reached our objective," she said.

ActionAIDS and the other beneficiaries were concerned that all minority groups
have access to the money, not just the Minority AIDS Project.

The Minority AIDS Project is an umbrella group that includes about 30
minority-led AIDS organizations that regard themselves as grassroots groups.

But the city's two largest minority AIDS groups - BEBASHI, which works in the
African American community, and the CONGRESO, which works in the Latino
community - are not part of the project.

In stinging criticism of the AIDS Ride this month, Roberts contended that the
Minority AIDS Coalition had been shut out of proceeds from the fund-raising
event. He said it was part of a pattern in which minority-led groups were
shortchanged in funding for AIDS.

Figures released by the city Health Department yesterday, however, indicate that
minority groups get most of the AIDS funding in Philadelphia.

Currently, Philadelphia gets about $15.3 million in public money - federal,
state and local - to finance AIDS services. Of that, $10.1 million goes to
minority agencies, health officials said.

The officials said they based their analysis on the federal definition of a
minority agency - one in which racial minorities constitute a majority of the
board of directors or a majority of the staff, including paid staff and
volunteers.

Overall, the Philadelphia area, including the city's Pennsylvania and New Jersey
suburbs, receives about $17.7 million in public AIDS dollars.

Because of the controversy surrounding the AIDS Ride, one original beneficiary -
For All Walks of Life, an umbrella group that runs the city's annual "AIDS Walk"
- pulled out of the event. The agency had planned to distribute its share of the
proceeds to other groups.

Despite the settlement of the funding dispute, there are still questions about
the overhead costs of the bike ride.

Pallotta & Associates Inc., a Los Angeles consulting company that will run the
ride, says that 20 percent of the gross proceeds will be used to feed, house and
care for the estimated 3,000 riders and that an additional 20 percent will cover
administrative costs and fund-raising efforts.

The money includes a flat fee of $180,000 in Philadelphia and another $180,000
in Washington for Pallotta to produce the ride.

Racial rifts emerge as AIDS shifts

BYLINE: LISA FREDERICK

SECTION: TAMPA BAY AND STATE; Pg. 3B

LENGTH: 1356 words

DATELINE: TAMPA



Carl DeVine's words become slow and agonized when he talks about two of the
friends he lost to AIDS last year.

His friends, Gwen Jenkins and Anthony Hayward, founded the People of Color  AIDS
Coalition four years ago with the goal of educating black people about  the
disease and improving the services offered to minority AIDS patients.

Based in two drafty, old converted homes in St. Petersburg, the coalition  is an
organization DeVine is fighting hard to keep afloat after its founders'  deaths.

He is battling meager financing and the nagging feeling that the odds are
stacked against him.

"I'm tired of seeing my friends die. I'm tired of seeing my relatives  die,"
DeVine says, his voice suddenly gaining strength and speed. "I'm tired  of
knowing that so many more of us are going to die because of greed and
selfishness and insensitivity."

DeVine is not alone in his frustration. Several people who work with  agencies
that provide AIDS education and patient services in the black  community say
they aren't getting their fair share of AIDS funding.

"Black organizations are collectively concerned that, as in so many other
things, we are being shut out of the process," says Walter Niles, a health
specialist with the Tampa Urban League.

It's a scenario that has played out in other cities nationwide, often  bitterly
and always emotionally, as the tug of war for dollars has turned  allies
fighting a common battle into fierce rivals.

The rifts are the result of the changing demographics of the disease.

A decade ago, AIDS primarily affected gay and bisexual men, so most AIDS
organizations, and the money that supported them, were focused on those  groups.
Today, the rate of new HIV infections is highest among heterosexual,
intravenous drug users and sexual partners, many of whom are minorities.

Yet, critics say, most AIDS programs are still being administered with gay
white men in mind.

Perhaps the most acrimonious example of the developing schism over AIDS  money
took place in Washington, D.C., last year.

The chief of the district's Agency for HIV/AIDS, a white lesbian, was fired
after an internal investigation concluded she had improperly attempted to  steer
money away from a clinic that has ties to the Nation of Islam, a black
religious sect.

The incident caused already simmering tensions regarding AIDS funding to  boil
over in that city.

Locally, activists such as DeVine will tell you there is no all-out "war"  over
money here.

But there soon could be unless something concrete comes from the emerging
dialogue and the new strategies recently created to address the problem.

Which agencies get what

   Most of the initiatives are being headed by the Suncoast AIDS Network, the
agency that coordinates health care and services for people with AIDS in a
multicounty area including Hillsborough and Pinellas.

A review board of SCAN officials ranks programs to decide which should get
federal and state money. The board decides, for example, how much money needs
to be set aside for pediatric AIDS cases or other specific populations.

Once organizations apply for federal dollars through SCAN, a review board  of
local officials and AIDS experts - none affiliated with SCAN - evaluates
applications and decides which will be financed.

Because of concerns expressed by DeVine and others, SCAN recently created a
Minority Affairs Committee, and this year tentatively has earmarked $ 163,000
for minority-run AIDS programs.

Black officials concerned about AIDS financing disparities say  discrimination
isn't the only cause for their financial difficulties. They  concede that other
organizations have an advantage simply because they've been  around a lot
longer.

It's hard for all private, non-profit organizations to get established. In
order to get grants, you already have to have something in the pot, Williams
said.

The National Commission on AIDS reported last year that racial and ethnic
factors play a big role in the nation's AIDS epidemic. Almost half of the
people in America with AIDS are black or Hispanic, the commission said.

As of March 1, there were 1,581 reported AIDS cases in Pinellas County.
Nineteen percent, or 304, were black, county health officials said. Blacks
account for 8 percent of the population in Pinellas.

Officials say part of the reason for the disproportionate numbers is that  AIDS
education still has trouble reaching some black neighborhoods.

"The black community is 13 years behind the white community when it comes  to
AIDS awareness," DeVine said.

But black AIDS activists bristle at suggestions that any resistance to
confronting the disease justifies the problems they have in getting money for
programs.

"The process is wrong and was designed to keep us out," DeVine said.

Different views, same problem

     When AIDS first came to public attention more than a decade ago, the gay
white men who were its primary victims rallied in the face of the crisis. Much
of the public awareness about the disease is due  to their efforts.

Whether it's institutional discrimination or fervent emotion, officials  agree
there is a problem.

"Discrimination was there before the AIDS epidemic," said Steven  Kindland,
spokesman for the state Department of Health and Rehabilitative  Services' AIDS
programs.

   While it may be intolerable, discrimination usually isn't fatal. Except  when
it comes to AIDS money.

"It means we have to try even harder here," says Chuck Kuehn, executive
director of the Tampa AIDS Network and president of SCAN's board of directors.
"Discrimination in this means people will die sooner."

Kuehn says SCAN has tried to prevent the infighting over money that has  torn
apart AIDS organizations in other cities.

The Tampa AIDS Network has had a black and a Hispanic resource worker on  staff
for some time now, and Kuehn estimates that 30 percent of the agency's  clients
are black. The organization recently opened an office in the heart of  Tampa, at
29th Street and 29th Avenue, partly to better serve those clients.

And while it would seem that black activists would applaud the network's
satellite office, many have mixed feelings about it.

They applaud the agency's commitment to providing AIDS services to  everyone,
but find it galling that worthy black organizations haven't been  able to do the
same thing because of money problems.

"(The AIDS network) is doing a lot of what we should be doing," says the  Rev.
Elliott Johnson, who ran an AIDS education program in Tampa's public  housing
complexes. His three-year $ 600,000 federal grant ran out last summer.

DeVine says the Tampa AIDS Network's presence in the heart of a black
neighborhood symbolizes the paternalistic "I know what's best for you"  attitude
many well-meaning white people have traditionally shown toward black  people.

"We aren't allowed to figure out what's best for us," he said.

Kuehn says criticism about the AIDS network's efforts in inner city Tampa  isn't
justified.

"We waited for many years for the African-American community to take
responsibility for AIDS in the African-American community. Then we couldn't
wait any longer," Kuehn said.

Black officials counter that it just makes sense that they should be the  ones
to design and carry out AIDS programs in black neighborhoods.

"Generally, people are more comfortable getting information from people  who
look most like them," Niles, of the Tampa Urban League, says.

Black heterosexuals who contract the disease through unprotected sex or
intravenous drug use may not be comfortable going to agencies they associate
with gay white men, DeVine said.

Clients, many of them drug users, quietly venture into Rainbow House, the
headquarters of People of Color AIDS Coalition, at all hours of the day for
advice and information. DeVine seeks them out in the dark corners and
alleyways.

"We can go where the white agencies cannot," he said. "It's time for us  to be
our own role models."

AIDS awareness funding cut back

BYLINE: EARLE KIMEL

SECTION: COMMUNITY TIMES; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 1206 words

DATELINE: TAMPA



When Project Save's $ 600,000 federal grant expired in July, the program
director, the Rev. Elliot Johnson, knew his AIDS education program was on its
deathbed.

But worse, he said, is the impact of its demise on Hillsborough's minority
residents.

Project Save provided AIDS education materials to residents in 10 public
housing complexes in Tampa. It sponsored eight-week AIDS prevention courses  for
at-risk minority youths.

"We have given our young people a death sentence," Johnson said. "It's  criminal
how any governmental body could keep on doing their business every  day and put
money in anything else, and overlook this."

Statistics compiled by the state's Florida AIDS program show that from July
1991 to July 1992, black people accounted for 32 percent of the 225 cases of
AIDS charted in Hillsborough County.

That's almost three times greater than the percentage of black people in
Hillsborough's total population.

Hispanics accounted for 12 percent of the AIDS cases, which is about the  same
as their percentage of the county's total population.

Dr. Luis Villanueva, director of HIV research at the University of South
Florida, said doctors aren't seeing as many new AIDS cases involving
homosexuals, a high-risk group since the virus began spreading in the late
1970s.

"They've already got the message," Villanueva said. "Now we are seeing  more
cases in IV drug users and Hispanics."

But even as the need grows, money for AIDS education has been disappearing.

Project Save lost its three-year grant from the Centers for Disease Control  on
July 14. That same day, Project HOPE, an AIDS education program aimed at  drug
abusers, lost its $ 600,000 federal grant.

The Hillsborough County Health Department can afford only two AIDS  educators,
one to work with black residents, and one to work with both  Hispanics and
whites.

Walter Niles, an official with the Tampa Urban League, blames the federal
government for the cutbacks.

"As in many other issues, the African-Americans seem to take a back seat  and
tend to be the last to be identified," Niles said. "It didn't take that  much
effort to get the information out in the white community. Why is it such  a
monumental task to get the information out in the black community?"

Chuck Kuehn, executive director of the Tampa AIDS Network, a regional
organization that provides prevention, support and advocacy services for  people
affected by AIDS, said his organization has been trying to reach more
minorities, and would like to open additional offices.

But 84 percent of TAN's $ 1.2-million budget comes from government grants,
Kuehn said. And because of grant restrictions, only $ 147,000 of that can go to

 AIDS education.

An official at a national organization that supplies AIDS prevention  materials
to churches said AIDS education frequently has to take a back seat  to the
problems of everyday life.

"You can't look at AIDS without looking at homelessness," said Jacquelyn
Wilkerson, program director for AIDS advocacy in African-American churches for
the AIDS National Interfaith Network. "You can't look at AIDS without looking
at lack of health care."

Because of health care shortages, black people frequently don't discover  they
have been infected with HIV until after it has turned into full-blown  AIDS,
said Henry Carley, president of the Tampa branch of the NAACP.

Carley said the NAACP has been working with the AIDS Coordinating Council  of
Hillsborough County in an effort to get the word out that early detection  is
critical.

The Coordinating Council, which has no budget, is made up of citizens and
government officials. Members began meeting in January 1990 to develop
strategies to address AIDS.

So far, the council has started a pilot project to find housing for AIDS
victims, and developed a program to provide AIDS education in the workplace.

A myth all AIDS educators are fighting is the idea that the disease strikes
only homosexual men and intravenous drug users.

"Black people and Hispanic people are real non-trusting and feel like  it's not
going to happen to them," said Gwen Jenkins, president of the People  of Color
AIDS Coalition in Pinellas County. "A lot of people think the white  man
introduced this to kill us."

The only thing educators can do is keep knocking on doors, said Margie  Shannon,
an official with the Southern Christian Leadership Conference/Women's
Organizational Movement for Equality Now national AIDS awareness program.

In 1990, SCLC/WOMEN started a program that coordinates AIDS education  through
churches. There are programs in Atlanta; Tuscaloosa, Ala.; Dayton,  Ohio; Kansas
City, Mo.; and Los Angeles.

Shannon could not say what bringing one to the bay area would cost. There  is no
SCLC chapter in Tampa. Seville Brown, president of the Pinellas County  chapter,
was unavailable for comment.

At first, Shannon said, ministers in the Atlanta area wanted no part of the
SCLC's program.

"Then all of a sudden the face of HIV and AIDS changed," she said.  "Women and
children and members of their congregation were becoming infected  and dying."

The Rev. Lacy Harwell, pastor of Maximo Presbyterian Church in St.  Petersburg,
said ministers often talk about AIDS prevention. But they're  preaching to the
wrong flock.

"Who's at risk? The hip-hop generation is at risk," said Harwell, who  helped
found the Suncoast Community AIDS Network, the umbrella organization  for most
AIDS-related funding in the Tampa Bay area. "Who are the hip-hop  generation
listening to? The rappers."

Villanueva said outreach programs work only with the right messengers.

Niles, who used to work with the Hillsborough County Health Department as  the
sexually transmitted disease surveillance supervisor, has a simple way to
increase the number of black people working to spread the word against HIV
infection.

"You go ahead and hire them," he said.

AETNA OFFERS ITS SUPPORT IN BATTLE AGAINST AIDS

BYLINE: (AP)

SECTION: INSURANCE, Pg. 9A

LENGTH: 417 words

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Conn.


Aetna Life & Casualty is among the largest corporate supporters of the fight
against AIDS, but company officials say the commitment is also a function of
self-interest.

How AIDS is handled "has a bearing on our business. The goal is to improve the
climate in which our employees live and work," said Stephen T. Moskey, head f
the company's AIDS philanthropy program.

Although several Hartford-based insurers have given thousand of dollars to AIDS
programs, the Aetna Foundation has made the biggest financial commitment to
fighting the disease.

In 1988, the Aetna Life and Casualty Foundation's AIDS philanthropy gave $
361,075 in grants to national and local organizations providing help to people
with AIDS.

"The foundation's response to AIDS is consistent with its response to other
significant social issues," Mr. Moskey said.

The ominous prediction that the disease will have struck close to 400,000
Americans by 1993 makes it crucial for foundations, including those of the
insurance industry, to address AIDS squarely, Mr. Moskey said.

In 1986-87, the latest years for which figures are available, the insurance
industry paid out $ 779 million in AIDS claims.

The Society of Actuaries has estimated that life insurance claims related to
AIDS could reach $ 50 billion by the year 2000, said Robert Waldron, an industry
spokesman.

Aetna earmarks its money for care and services of ill people, often donating to
small, underfinanced groups of volunteers.

Recent contributions have gone to the Connecticut AIDS Residence program of New
Haven, AIDS Project Hartford, the House AIDS foundations, the Village Nursing
Home of New York City and a pilot project, also in New York, aimed at juvenile
offenders whose drug and sexual habits put them at risk to AIDS.

This spring the insurance industry as a whole unveiled a three-year $ 16.2
million AIDS-finance campaign.

Besides Aetna, other Hartford-based insurers have also gotten into the act.

In 1987, the Connecticut Mutual Life Foundation underwrote a production of a
play about AIDS with the proceeds going to AIDS Project Hartford. Last year it
gave $ 2,000 to AIDS Ministries of Connecticut and $ 5,000 to AIDS Project
Hartford.

So far this year, Connecticut Mutual has contributed $ 7,000 to the state's AIDS
media campaign and $ 18,000 to the Hartford Foundation for Public Giving for a
study of AIDS education in high-risk communities, according to Astrida Olds, the
foundations assistance vice-president.

Ontario boosts funding for AIDS

BYLINE: By Kelly Toughill Toronto Star

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A3

LENGTH: 484 words


   Ontario will dramatically expand its program to fight AIDS, funding three new
out-patient clinics and a treatment centre that is the first of its kind in
Canada, the health minister has announced.

"AIDS is the public health challenge of a generation," Health Minister Elinor
Caplan said yesterday. "This is a forward-looking plan that will help meet the
needs of the future."

The new clinics announced yesterday include a special psychiatric clinic at Mt.
Sinai Hospital in Toronto and general-care clinics at St. Joseph's Hospital in
London and Chedoke McMaster Hospital in Hamilton for people infected with the
AIDS virus. There are already six AIDS clinics in Ontario, including five in
Toronto.

In all, provincial funding for the fight against AIDS will be boosted by $7.4
million this year, Caplan said.

The new plan includes more than $500,000 to fund Canada's first treatment centre
for aerosolized pentamidine, an inhaled antibiotic taken to ward off a form of
pneumonia that is the most common killer of people with AIDS.

The plan also includes an additional $2 million for 10 non-profit AIDS
organizations, including the AIDS Committee of Toronto. It also includes another
$3.1 million to fund AIDS-related activities by local boards of health.

Plan applauded

Several top AIDS activists applauded the new plan yesterday, although others
booed Caplan when she was asked about a law requiring officials to collect the
names of people who are infected with the virus that causes AIDS.

"There is never enough money, but this is certainly a big increase," said Tom
Nash, executive director of the Toronto PWA (People With AIDS) Foundation.
"Ontario is setting a standard for funding of community-based organizations."

"There is no question that Ontario is the national leader on this issue," said
Stephen Manning, executive director of the AIDS Committee of Toronto.

More people have been diagnosed with AIDS in Ontario than in any other province.
According to federal health officials, 1,079 people have been diagnosed with
AIDS in Ontario, of whom 702 have died.

AIDS is caused by a virus that gradually destroys the body's immune system,
leaving people vulnerable to other infections, such as the unusual form of
pneumonia that is treated with aerosolized pentamidine. The virus is found in
blood and semen and is most often passed during intercourse and the sharing of
needles by infected drug users.

Under Ontario law, doctors can be compelled to reveal the names of patients who
are infected with the virus, and health officials are supposed to track down the
sexual partners of those patients to warn them they may have been exposed to the
virus.

Activists have protested the law, saying people avoid being tested for fear
their names will slip out of public health files and that somehow their employer
or neighbors will find out.

Minimizing AIDS danger trendy but short-sighted

BYLINE: By Abigail Trafford Special to The Star

SECTION: LIFE; Pg. C1

LENGTH: 1485 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON


   WASHINGTON - First came the media wave of fear and scenarios of Armageddon,
as though AIDS were the Space Age cousin of Black Death, which ravaged Europe in
the 14th century.

Now, the anti-hype backlash has started, and it's trendy in some places to
minimize the AIDS epidemic.

Columnist Michael Kinsley of New Republic magazine writes that "a year from now,
no one will be talking much about AIDS any more." Pulitzer prize-winning
columnist Charles Krauthammer is convinced, "AIDS is not the pandemic its
publicists would like us to believe."

In the sometime-fickle fashion of medical news, it could seem that AIDS is
destined to become just another "disease of the week," following in the wake of
previous high-profile health "crises" such as drug abuse, herpes and nuclear
winter.

But if press coverage has changed in the last month, the reality of AIDS has
not.

"People shouldn't lose sight of the fact that the prediction of a quarter of a
million cases in the United States is coming true," says Nobel prize winner
David Baltimore, director of the Whitehead Institute in Cambridge, Mass., and
co-chairman of the National Academy of Sciences report on AIDS. "We have a major
problem, and no amount of wishing is going to make it go away."

Hospital beds

More than 110 countries around the world have reported cases. In the AIDS-belt
countries of Africa, the World Health Organization estimates that 25 to 30 per
cent of all hospital beds are filled with men and women who have AIDS. In New
York city, AIDS is the leading cause of death in men ages 25 to 44 and in women
25 to 34.

The "no problem" contingent notes that North Americans are much likelier to die
of something else: Heart attacks claim nearly 600,000 American and Canadian
lives a year; cancer, 509,000. Well over one million suffer from Alzheimer's
disease. Why should there be all this fuss - and resources - devoted to AIDS?

There are several reasons why AIDS deserves what Krauthammer too archly calls
"its privileged position" in the realm of diseases.

It's new. Unlike cancer, drug abuse or other high-profile medical problems, AIDS
is an entirely new disease. The first case was reported in 1981. The earliest
evidence of the AIDS virus has been traced to a 1959 blood sample taken from a
tuberculosis patient in Africa.

It's virtually 100 percent fatal. This is typical of the early stages of any new
infectious epidemic. In contrast, there are effective therapies for heart
disease and certain forms of cancer, and significant numbers of patients live
for many years after the diagnosis. In terms of terribleness, AIDS might more
aptly be compared to the incurable genetic disorder of Huntington's disease,
which also hits people in middle age and destroys the mind and body. The
difference is that Huntington's disease is not infectious and remains relatively
rare. AIDS has already jumped from 183 cases in the United States in 1981 to
nearly 40,000 cases today and is expected to reach 270,000 over the next four
years. There are 1,205 reported cases of AIDS in Canada.

High-risk groups

AIDS is political. Last week, U.S. President Ronald Reagan made his first visit
to AIDS patients - children being treated at the clinical centre at the National
Institutes of Health. The president likened AIDS to smallpox and polio, and
introduced members of his new AIDS advisory panel.

Throughout the world, AIDS has become highly politicized, raising concerns that
AIDS angst might unleash a wave of discrimination and even violence against
patients and high-risk groups. "AIDS has unveiled thinly disguised prejudice
about race, religion, social class and nationality," says the World Health
Organization's Dr. Jonathan Mann.

Overshadowing all this is scientific uncertainty. Despite advances in isolating
the virus and developing experimental drugs, AIDS experts do not have answers to
the big questions: How did AIDS start? How fast is it spreading? (Actual cases
reflect the spread of the virus five years ago - not the extent of infection
today.) How bad is the epidemic going to get?

It is this uncertainty about AIDS that causes the pendulum to swing back and
forth in the public's perception of the disease.

"People want simple, straightforward answers," says Dr. Harold Jaffe, chief AIDS
epidemiologist at the Centres for

Disease Control in Atlanta. "Is the housewife in Cedar Rapids at risk? If no, we
don't want to hear about it. If yes, then let's go all out and do extreme
measures like quarantine. The problem of AIDS is more complex than that," he
says.

A key issue in the United States right now is whether AIDS is going to "break
out" into the so-called "mainstream" heterosexual community. Scientists know
that the virus can be transmitted through heterosexual intercourse. In Africa
and Haiti, the disease affects both men and women - yet in the United States and
Europe, AIDS is primarily a disease that strikes homosexuals and drug abusers.
Why is this?

"I don't think we really know," says Jaffe.

There are a number of theories: different sexual lifestyles in parts of Africa;
higher rates of venereal diseases there, such as genital ulcers thought to
increase the risk of contracting infection; lack of screening blood for
contamination; more frequent use of transfusions and sharing of unsterilized
needles in medical practice; as well as the burden of malnutrition and other
diseases that weaken the immune system.

Centres for Disease Control officials say that, at the moment, the risk of
heterosexual spread is confined to intravenous drug abusers and their sex
partners and the sex partners of bisexual men. These scientists believe that
there will not be the explosive increase among other heterosexuals that has been
seen among homosexuals and drug abusers.

Infected animals

Yet some say it is only a matter of time. Even if AIDS in the United States
never becomes as widespread as it is in Africa, many researchers predict a slow
and steady increase among heterosexuals so that in 10 or 15 years, a sizable
proportion of the general population will be affected. "At that time, people
will start to panic," says Dr. Myron Essex of Harvard's School of Public Health.

Just as uncertain as the heterosexual spread question - and as politically
touchy - is the question of how and where AIDS began. One theory is that the
virus changed from a harmless agent into a killer. Viruses are known to mutate -
the constantly changing flu virus is one example. Another theory is that the
AIDS virus "jumped" from animals to human beings. A similar virus has been found
in monkeys, but does not cause disease in infected animals. One hypothesis is
that the method of catching and trapping monkeys in Africa causes so much
bleeding in the animals and the trappers that the virus could be passed along in
blood.

But any scientific speculation on the origins of AIDS quickly translates into
political tension. African nations are very sensitive about being blamed for
starting AIDS. After Dr. Robert Gallo of the National Cancer Institute announced
at the Third International Conference on AIDS in June that he had isolated yet
another AIDS virus from Nigerian patients, that country protested the report. In
Africa, meanwhile, people were led to believe that the disease came from
American military advisers sent to Africa - or was a plot of chemical warfare.

Public policy

The medical and political confusion over AIDS is reminiscent of the first
syphilis outbreak in the late 14th and early 15th centuries. "Fantastic
theories" at the time, according to Hans Zinsser, author of Rats, Lice and
History, said the epidemic "was started by the intercourse of a man with a mare
. . . (or) a similar relationship with a monkey." The French called syphilis the
"Neapolitan disease;" the Italians named it the "French affliction." To this
day, scientists haven't been able to figure out if the New World Indians gave it
to the Europeans or the other way around.

It is likely that many of the questions about AIDS will remain unanswered as the
disease continues to spread. In this environment of uncertainty, public policy
must be made: How, for example, will hospitals handle the increased load of
cases? Who will pay - the government? Private insurance?

This same uncertainty also fuels the current chic to play down AIDS. In the
absence of new information, the public is tired of hearing about AIDS. The
concern is that this genre of denial may mask a more disturbing political trend
- that of ignoring AIDS because it doesn't seem to pose a threat to white
middle-class heterosexuals, who make up the majority of voters.

But AIDS is not a disease that will respond to benign neglect. As the National
Cancer Institute's Gallo puts it: "Until we have a vaccine, this virus is not
going to go away. It's going to be here forever."

AIDS AND THE STUDENT BODY

BYLINE: ANNE V. HULL

SECTION: FLORIDIAN; Pg. 1F

LENGTH: 2379 words

DATELINE: TAMPA



Francine Brandt, a 21 year-old communications major at the University    of
South Florida in Tampa, tells a joke about screening men before she    dates
them - "I check their health cards."

     Stephanie Stone, a 21 year-old USF senior, says the fear of AIDS    has
tempered the sex lives of college women. "Sex is definitely with    people you
know," she says. "I think one-night stands are going out    of business."

     Cheryl Hartsough, a 27-year-old dietician at USF, is engaged to a    man
she has been dating for more than two years, but the fear of AIDS    still
lingers in her mind. "In any relationship, you think about a    person's past.
Now with AIDS, something can really come back to haunt    you."

     The fear of AIDS among female college students has squelched any    notions
about free love left over from the sexual revolution of the    '60s. Though AIDS
remains a mystery to most college women, the virus    has made them scrutinize
their sex lives. It has added fear and doubt,    and taken away spontaneity.
Through educational programs or dormitory    gossip, college women are finding
out that sex with the wrong man can    be deadly.

     Both USF students and a few of Florida's health educators    reluctantly
predict that more heterosexuals will have to die before the    straight world
takes AIDS seriously. Though young women are going about    their sex lives with
a new caution, few seem anxious to question their    partners about sexual
histories. Many of them admit they are unclear on    exactly how a person can
contract the AIDS virus.

     "The idea before was, 'If I'm a heterosexual female, I am not at    risk
for AIDS'," says Gwen Ritter, the health educator for student    services at
USF. "Now women are finding out they could have had one    encounter five years
ago and been infected."

     Ritter, a 26 year-old graduate student, counsels and instructs USF
students about drugs, sex and other health-related issues. Because AIDS    has
reached epidemic proportions in this country, Ritter is also    responsible for
advising the university's faculty and staff members on    AIDS issues.

     Ritter senses a new caution in the sexual practices of female    students.
She says some of the wiser women who have casual sex have    taken a cue from
the gay community about safe sex - "AIDS has brought    back the condom," says
Ritter.

     In October, in a public health report on AIDS requested by    President
Reagan, Surgeon General Everett Koop reported that the condom    is "the best
protection against (AIDS) infection right now, barring    abstinence."

     There is no known cure for AIDS, which has already claimed the    lives of
more than 15,000 people in the United States. The virus that    causes AIDS -
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome - is spread through    intimate contact with
a carrier's bodily fluids, such as blood and    semen. The virus attacks the
immune system, which normally acts on its    own to fight sickness and disease.
Not all infected persons develop    AIDS.

     When the AIDS virus first began to appear in 1981, it was thought    to
predominantly afflict promiscuous gay men and hypodermic needle    (intravenous)
users. Now, it is thought that the AIDS virus is a    potential threat to any
person who is sexually active. Though    homosexual men and IV drug abusers are
still at the most risk of    contracting the virus, heterosexuals are not
immune.

     The AIDS virus may be passed from one heterosexual to another    through
intercourse or oral sex if one of the partners is actively    carrying the AIDS
virus. A heterosexual can contract the virus through    IV drug abuse or an
infected blood transfusion, although receiving    infected blood is a rare
occurance. A heterosexual woman may also    contract the virus by having sex
with a bisexual male who is carrying    the AIDS virus.

     The federal Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta reported    that
as of Dec. 2, 1986 there have been 1,094 heterosexual cases of    AIDS in the
United States. In most cases, these are people who have had    heterosexual
contact with a virus carrier - a bisexual, IV drug abuser,    prostitute or
heterosexual who has contracted the virus.

     The CDC predicts that heterosexual AIDS cases will comprise nearly    10
percent of all AIDS cases by 1991. Currently AIDS cases transmitted    through
heterosexual contact comprise 4 percent.

     In a recent Glamour magazine survey, which polled 800 women about    topics
ranging from health issues to career goals, almost half of the    women admitted
they have changed their sexual habits because they are      afraid of
contracting AIDS.

     At the University of South Florida, which has more then 29,000    students,
this fear of AIDS among women is evident.

     Cheryl Hartsough says AIDS has made women really think about their
partners' sexuality. "Are they bi (sexual)? Have they slept with
prostitutes?" she asks. Though Hartsough has been involved in a    monogamous
relationship with a man for a couple of years, she expresses    some concern
about their individual sexual histories.

     During a past relationship, a former boyfriend of Hartsough's had    slept
with another woman. "And this girl was sleeping with    everybody," says
Hartsough. "So anything that girl did, I was doing,    too. It was in my body. I
was worried."

     The AIDS virus can remain dormant in a person for more than five    years.
Also, a person may carry the virus without developing any    symptoms yet still
be capable of transmitting it. "This is death,"    says Hartsough. "You can't
just take a couple of pills to get over    it."

     Francine Brandt says there has been a backlash of homophobia - fear    of
homosexuals - as a result of the hysteria over AIDS. She says she    worries
when a good-looking boyfriend of hers, who lives in Fort    Lauderdale, goes
near a beach frequented by gay men.



   When Brandt was a resident assistant for a women's dormitory last
semester, a survey about AIDS was distributed in her hall. One of the
questions asked if a student would share a bathroom with someone who    had
AIDS. "They all said 'no way,"' says Brandt. "They were    completely against
having anything to do with someone who has AIDS."    (Medical experts agree that
in order for the AIDS virus to be    transmitted, intimate contact with a
carrier's blood or semen must    occur.)        The fear of AIDS has made her
scrutinize the men she dates, she    says. "I remember something my mother told
me a long time ago: Don't    be fooled to think that most men don't have some
kind of a homosexual    tendency."

     The Kinsey Institute, a sexual behavior research center, reported    in
1948 that 37 percent of white American males have had a homosexual    encounter
that resulted in orgasm at least once. The institute still    relies on that 37
percent figure when studying human sexual behavior    today.

     But men who have one homosexual experience are not considered to be    at
high risk for AIDS, just as a man who has one experience with a    prostitute is
not likely to contract the virus - unless that contact is    with an AIDS virus
carrier. It's a game of odds. The more times a    person has sexual contact with
someone in a risk group, the greater the    chance for meeting up with the
virus.

     Jennifer Dawson, 22, a public relations major at USF, says that
                because she has a steady boyfriend, AIDS doesn't directly affect
her    life. "I'm just not that wild and crazy anymore," says Dawson.    "Today
I was thinking, usually when you see AIDS, you associate it    with homosexuals.

 But this could get out of hand. Then what do you    do?"

     According to Nikki Economou, the situation is already out of hand.

 Economou, (pronounced Ee-ka-no-mu), is the Health and Rehabilitative
Services (HRS) AIDS coordinator for 15 counties in Florida, including
Hillsborough and Pinellas. Economou, an epidemiologist, says she has    seen a
dramatic change in the type of person with the AIDS virus.

     When she first began working at the Immunodeficiency Clinic at the    USF
Medical Clinic about four years ago, the majority of people coming    in with
symptoms of the AIDS virus were Haitians and gay male    prostitutes and
hustlers who had sex on the average of six or seven    times a day. (Researchers
later found that most of the Haitians were    either bisexual, homosexual or IV
drug abusers.)

        That was four years ago. Before Economou left the clinic six    months
ago to become the AIDS coordinator for HRS, she was noticing a    new type of
AIDS virus sufferer. She saw female prostitutes, women who    were wives of IV
drug abusers and wives of bisexuals. She also saw    straight, non-drug abusing
men.

     "These men were coming to us with the virus and they were going    nuts,"
says Economou. "These guys said we were crazy. They'd say,    'I'm not queer and
I don't shoot up."'        Economou said that when she asked the men about their
sexual    habits, they said they had gone to "nice clubs" and had sex with
"nice girls."

     "The bottom line was, these guys didn't know these women had    previously
had sex with other men who were either bisexual or IV drug    abusers."

     Economou says the national number of homosexual AIDS cases is    doubling
every 12 to 13 months, while the number of heterosexual AIDS    cases is
doubling every five to six months.

     Dennis Ledford, an immunologist and assistant professor at USF,    doesn't
see AIDS spreading into the general sexual populace. Though he    agrees with
the CDC that by 1991 10 percent of all AIDS cases could be    heterosexuals, he
thinks the number is misleading. Of those    heterosexuals, Ledford says, many
of them will be IV drug abusers or    will have had sex with an AIDS carrier
such as an IV drug abuser,    prostitute or bisexual. Ledford says the majority
of AIDS cases he sees    are still gay men. Of the AIDS cases he's seen, he
says, "straight men    who don't use drugs are rare." Ledford points out,
though, that    bisexuals may be more common than physicians know because
bisexuals    sometimes deny homosexual experiences.

     "AIDS is a sexually transmitted disease," says Ledford. "Know    your
partners and have fewer partners."

     That is the advice most health officials give, yet it is perhaps    not
explicit enough for college students. Gregory Graham, a USF senior,    says
there is a dangerous lack of information on AIDS available to    students on
campus.

      "When someone gets AIDS who lives in the dorm, it's going to be    mass
hysteria," says Graham, a former member of the USF student    government and the
USF Gay and Lesbian Coalition. Last semester, as the    Minority Affairs
Advocate for student government, he tried to get    funding for an AIDS
Education Program, which would include passing out    safe-sex brochures on
campus and an AIDS hotline for students. Student    government said no.
Says Graham, "I feel like Noah predicting the flood and no one's    listening to
me, let alone giving me the wood to build my ark."        David Matthes, the
student government president at the time of    Graham's proposal last semester,
was against the AIDS Education    Program. "I threatened to veto it if it came
up for a vote," says    Matthes. He says the program would be a duplication of
existing    AIDS-related services available for students. Matthes said Graham's
    program would cost about $ 5,000, and that money would have come from    the
$ 2.2-million annual budget for student activities and services.

     "He's a homophobe," says Graham, who disagrees with Matthes'    argument
that the AIDS Education Program would be a duplication of    services.      "We
(student government) don't have any problem with    homosexuals," says Matthes.
"We don't condone them or condemn them."

 He agrees that AIDS information should be available for all USF    students,
but says it is already available through other university    organizations.

     According to Gwen Ritter, the USF health educator, much of the AIDS
education on campus is being done by members of the Gay and Lesbian
Coalition. The USF coalition, established in 1974, is the largest and    oldest
organized group of gay students in Florida. Each semester at    USF, members of
the coalition speak to health and psychology classes    about homosexuality.
According to one member who frequently speaks in    classrooms, the students
were very cloudy on their AIDS facts.

     "Last semester, the situation we found was one of extreme    ignorance,"
says Suzanne Connelly, co-chairperson of the coalition who    spoke to about 25
classes. "They thought it was just a gay issue."

 But, she adds, "seeing babies, women and straight men with AIDS, they    are
slowly realizing they could be affected, too."

     Julie Brown, a student at USF, says that AIDS has been the most
important factor in changing the way women of this decade feel about    their
sexuality. "It has made girls cautious about their sexuality,    about one-night
stands, about getting to know people before sex," says    Brown.

     "I think it has turned the sexual revolution around a little bit,
emotionally and physically."

The national AIDS conference: Australia begins search for;
drug to combat AIDS

LENGTH: 846 words


SYDNEY - Australia has begun searching for its own anti-viral drug to combat
AIDS at a time when a United Nations authority has warned that we might not have
grasped the extent of the crisis posed by the disease.

The UN expert said AIDS threatened to deplete the young adult population in some
countries to an extent not matched by world wars.

The Second National AIDS Conference, held here at the weekend, was told that
CSIRO scientists in Melbourne were working with staff at Fairfield Hospital to
try to find an anti-viral drug for people with Acquired Immune Deficiency
Syndrome.

But the CSIRO dismissed allegations that research progress had been halted by
lack of funds.

A group of AIDS sufferers has claimed that drugs being developed by the CSIRO
could be more effective than AZT, the breakthrough treatment revealed in the US.

The claim was given credibility when it was included in a key speech to the
conference by the head of the National Advisory Committee on AIDS, Ms Ita
Buttrose.

However, it prompted sharp denials from AIDS task force chairman, Professor
David Penington, and one of the CSIRO's chief research scientists, Mr George
Holan.

Both denied that the research had gone any further than basic laboratory work
and they said there was no question of being denied Government money for the
project.

At the AIDS conference, the World Health Organisation's AIDS control chief, Dr
Jonathon Mann, said he was worried that Australia's public health leaders were
failing to explain fully the AIDS threat.

He said experts should not back away from giving the full grim picture of AIDS.

"People here strike me as being afraid to say it the way it is," he said. "The
realities are not good and I get frustrated when I see people soft pedalling on
the realities."

Dr Mann said too few people realised that heterosexual activity was now the most
common way of spreading AIDS.

Ms Buttrose said she supported the idea of educating school children about the
disease.

She said she would provide State education departments with information on which
to base AIDS courses for children.

Ms Buttrose acknowledged that the issue could be controversial but said the
threat of AIDS should be enough to warrant its becoming part of the sex
education curriculum.

She said the Federal Government would launch a new $2m education campaign on
AIDS in February. Part of the market research for the program would be a survey
of Australian youth to discover what they know and what they needed to know
about the disease.

One of the world's leading virus researchers, Massachusetts General Hospital
virology research director Dr Martin Hirschtold, told the conference that human
trials of an AIDS vaccine could begin within a year.

But he said the only animal on which vaccine tests could be performed
effectively was the chimpanzee, which was an endangered species and few were
available for research.

The director of NSW Prison Medical Services, Dr Frank McLeod, told the
conference that the NSW Government was considering an AIDS screening program for
prisoners.

He said mandatory AIDS testing, as happened in Queensland, had been ruled out
but all prisoners in NSW may shortly be offered the test in a Government effort
to halt the spread of the virus.

He said the biggest AIDS problem in the State's gaols was from drug users using
syringes.

The spokesman for the Australian Federation of AIDS Organisations, Mr Greg
Tillet, claimed dozens of AIDS projects were facing possible closure because
State governments had failed to pay grants.

He said grants should have been paid three months ago, but governments had so
far not kept their side of the bargain.

"The consequence of these delays will be that the effort to stop the spread of
AIDS will be impaired. If this situation continues, programs will have to stop
and as a result there will be more AIDS cases," he said.

Mr Tillet said States affected were New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia,
Western Australia and the ACT.

He said they should have paid their contributions shortly after the Federal
Budget, in September.

In ADELAIDE the SA Health Commission's co-ordinator of AIDS programs, Dr Michael
Ross, said yesterday he was "mystified" by Mr Tillet's claims.

All funding for AIDS projects in SA had been made promptly.

"I personally authorised cheques for $10,000 to the AIDS Council of SA and the
Gay Counselling Service for ongoing expenses a couple of months ago," he said.

(The AIDS Council of SA is the local affiliate of the Australian Federation of
AIDS Organisations and last fiscal year received about $50,000 in funding
through the State Government.)

Dr Ross said SA was still awaiting advice from the Federal Government on a State
Government application for a 66 p.c. increase in funding towards AIDS-related
projects.

Some of the concern about funding might have arisen over the State Government's
maintaining funding at "previous rates" until it received Federal Government
advice of what it had approved for 1986-87.

NEW YORK PLANS TO TURN HOSPITAL INTO AIDS CENTER

BYLINE: By RONALD SULLIVAN

SECTION: Section A; Page 1, Column 2; Metropolitan Desk

LENGTH: 989 words


St. Clare's Hospital in Manhattan would become New York City's first hospital to
treat only AIDS and related illnesses under plans disclosed yesterday by state
and Federal health officials.

The hospital's president said he was ''bitterly opposed'' to the plan because he
wanted the institution to continue treating both AIDS and general-care patients.
But health officials said the plan did not need his approval.

St. Clare's, with 250 beds, would be the largest hospital in the nation devoted
to AIDS.

The Institute for Immunological Disorders in Houston, affiliated with the
University of Texas, was created last year for the exclusive treatment of AIDS.
It has space for 150 beds but officials of the struggling institution said
yesterday that on an average day only 13 patients were hospitalized there.

In the past few years, St. Clare's, a small Roman Catholic hospital at 426 West
52d Street, has transformed itself from a small, general-care community
hospital, which the state wanted to close a few years ago as medically unneeded,
into a hospital serving one of the largest numbers of AIDS patients in the
country.

With 50 or so AIDS patients hospitalized on any given day, St Clare's now has as
many as Bellevue Hospital Center, the city's largest AIDS treatment center, and
about 20 more than San Francisco General Hospital, one of the nation's leading
AIDS centers.

The New York Health Systems Agency, the federally sponsored organization that is
empowered by the State Department of Health to draft an overall hospital plan
for the city, recommended the move. Raymond Sweeney, director of the New York
State Department of Health's Office of Health Systems Management, said yesterday
that his office would approve it. #60 Beds Set Aside The president of St.
Clare's, Richard N. Yezzo, assailed the plan, although the hospital has already
been designated by the state as an AIDS center and has allocated 60 of its beds
for the specialized care of AIDS patients.

Ten of the 60 beds are in a guarded unit that treats AIDS patients from the
state prison system.

To gain state designation as an AIDS center, which carries a higher rate of
patient reimbursement income, St. Clare's was required to provide a wide range
of comprehensive inpatient and outpatient services. They include social services
and housing for AIDS patients from their first siege of illness to the day they
die.

In addition to St. Clare's, eight municipal hospitals have applied for
designation as AIDS centers. So have seven private hospitals in the city,
including Presbyterian, New York, Montefiore, St. Luke's-Roosevelt and St.
Vincent's.

President's Concern

Mr. Yezzo said in an interview that news reports of an expanded conversion of
St. Clare's into a hospital treating only AIDS would ''destroy'' its ability to
continue to attract other medical and surgical patients to its 155 general-care
beds.

Mr. Yezzo said he had ''ruled out'' any expansion of service to AIDS patients
beyond adding 35 beds this year to the 60 now devoted to AIDS.

But Mr. Sweeney said the hospital had submitted plans with the state that would
convert 175 beds to the specialized treatment of AIDS and AIDS-related
illnesses. He said the plans included opening a new self-care unit for homeless
AIDS patients, long-term nursing and hospice units and beds for the treatment of
drug and alcohol abuse by people at risk for AIDS.

Mr. Sweeney also said St. Clare's had requested state permission to transform 20
general-care beds into psychiatric beds for the care of dementia in AIDS and
AIDS-related cases.

Rationale for Regulation

In any event, the changes will be made within a year or so, Mr. Sweeney said.

''It makes a lot of sense to make St. Clare's totally dedicated to AIDS,'' he
said. ''They are well along in that direction.''

Both the state and the Health Systems Agency contend that the city has too many
hospital beds and that any new AIDS specialty beds should come from the existing
35,000 general-care beds in private and public hospitals.

The executive director of the Health Systems Agency, Daniel McGowan, said its
overall strategy in the city for dealing with the expanding AIDS epidemic
includes a recommendation that St. Clare's be converted into an ''AIDS
hospital.''

At the same time, he said that he understood the serious problems the plan posed
for the hospital and that he expected any conversion to be done ''piece by
piece'' to ease disruption of the hospital's medical staff and its workers, and
of the surrounding community.

Reaction by Doctors

Dr. Debra Spicehandler, head of AIDS services at St. Clare's, said the
hospital's physicians ''were very supportive'' of the hospital's expanding AIDS
programs. But she said she did not know of any plans to transform the hospital
exclusively to an AIDS hospital and thus had no way to know how doctors would
react.

According to Dr. David Axelrod, the State Health Commissioner, the AIDS epidemic
has reached such proportions in New York City that more than 700 AIDS patients
are hospitalized on any given day. By 1991, he said, that number would more than
double, causing a ''medical catastrophe'' that would cost $1 billion in annual
hospital costs alone.

More than 10,000 cases and 6,000 deaths have been reported in the city since
1981. Dr. Axelrod predicted that there would be 40,000 cases and as many as
30,000 deaths by 1991.

AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is regarded as the nation's
leading public health concern and is the leading killer of men between the ages
of 25 and 29 in New York City.

The illness is caused by the HIV virus, which is transmitted almost exclusively
through intimate sexual contact or by contaminated needles and syringes. The
virus attacks the body's immune system, leaving victims prey to a variety of
fatal illnesses.

The major risk groups are sexually active homosexuals and intravenous drugs
users.

Can Mali be weaned off aid?

BYLINE: Jonathan Glennieguardian.co.uk

LENGTH: 1036 words

ABSTRACT

Jonathan Glennie: Mali relies on aid for about 50% of its public expenditure.
Perhaps it's time to look at how to end this dependence

FULL TEXT

I was in  last week talking to donor and government officials, and then to NGOs,
about ending aid dependence. Slightly hopeful, you might think, given how
incredibly poor and aid-dependent Mali is, but the person organising the donor
group's annual away-day thought it was time to get the issue on the table.

The traditional way for countries to exit from aid is simple: economic growth.
With more money in the economy (and therefore the exchequer) there is less need
for external help. Countries like South Korea and Botswana graduated from aid in
this way in the 1970s, and quite a few countries are now moving in this
direction, from Bolivia to Vietnam to Ghana.

But why would a country that is still struggling economically, like Mali, want
to consider reducing the amount of aid it receives rather than seek to bring in
as much as it possibly can (which is, by most accounts, the Malian government's
present strategy)?

Because over time, after long periods of high aid dependence, the negative
institutional impacts get very serious, as governments lose their ability to
lead on policy, and as their accountability to citizens is eroded. Rather than
develop, state institutions can be retarded. The impacts of donor conditionality
(such as the insistence, in Mali's case, on privatising everything in sight), an
integral part of the aid deal, can also be damaging for development and poverty
reduction.

While efforts to mitigate this problem, including the Paris Declaration's
emphasis on ownership, are , the problem has proved to be fairly intractable
over the years. Ultimately, he who pays the piper calls the tune.

Might high levels of aid actually be part of the problem, rather than the
solution? Countries need to weigh up the negative consequences of aid dependence
against aid's very positive impacts, such as schools built and children
vaccinated. Ravi Kanbur, formerly the World Bank's chief Africa economist, put
it well when he said: "A reduced volume of conventional development aid to
Africa [is] a price worth paying for reduced aid dependence."

Mali relies on aid for almost 50% of its government expenditure. If aid goes up
as promised, this figure will reach about 60% by 2015. Is that the future
Malians want, or are there alternatives? (I have discussed this in a little more
detail .)

How were these reflections received in Mali? Overall, I came away even surer
that the issue of aid dependence is crucial to a serious analysis of aid and
deserves to be a regular part of the debate in donor and recipient countries.
All the donor agency and NGO representatives (national and international)
emphasised this, with some commenting on a "culture" of aid dependence,
something I had not discussed. Malian government representatives were evenly
split between those who agreed and those who thought that some of us were
overstating the problem.

What about a strategy to end aid dependence? Views were evenly split on this.
While everyone acknowledges that there are alternative financing mechanisms to
aid (mostly treading water in the UN's under-appreciated Financing for
Development process) people disagree on how politically feasible they are and
how helpful they would be in a case like Mali.

At lunch I sat next to two senior Malians who agreed with my analysis, but who
had contrasting views on what strategy to pursue. One, who works for a large
donor agency, agreed with my view that it is time to put more emphasis on other
forms of finance and deliberately to start to reduce aid in the coming years.

Countering this was a presidential adviser who thought we were failing to grasp
the political realities. It's all very well to talk about more taxes, better use
of savings through banking reform, stopping capital flight etc, but if these
measures were politically possible they would already be in train. The reality
is that aid is the only serious option open to the government to pay for half
its annual expenditure. He regretted this, but saw no alternative.

It was an interesting discussion, which was repeated along fairly similar lines
with the NGO community the next day. Both groups were pleased to have an
opportunity to discuss these issues, which were not a frequent topic of
conversation, and will be continuing the discussion in their forthcoming
meetings.

So what did I take away from the visit? First, policy analysts working on aid
should devote more time to thinking about institutional aid dependency and the
ongoing impacts of conditionality. There was clear agreement on these issues in
the Mali discussions.

Second, a strategy to reduce aid apart from the traditional one of waiting for
growth to take off will be as challenging as it sounds. But opening the
discussion in a sensible way (ie getting away from the phoney "pro-aid" v "anti-
aid" debates), and in particular putting more effort into developing a "beyond
aid" agenda, which highlights domestic resource mobilisation and a reduction in
outflows, is long overdue.

A couple of years ago, talk of helping the poorest countries to reduce aid in
the medium to long-term was seen as eccentric in much of the aid industry. It
seems to me more and more people are realising that an agenda to reduce aid
dependence is not in conflict with efforts to make aid more effective. In fact,
it is a vital complement to it. (And it does not mean reducing aid overall, as I
argued .)

People in donor and recipient countries are keen to know what the aid exit
strategy is. It is possible that they understand the problem more instinctively
than the aid professionals themselves (although the head of France's development
agency spoke before me in Mali along broadly similar lines). Rather than
undermining the case for development co-operation, introducing a discussion of
exit strategies makes it more dynamic and urgent.

Good news, then, that - according to what I've been told - the issue of aid exit
strategies will be on the agenda of the next big international meeting on the
Paris agenda for aid effectiveness (HLF4) in South Korea in November.

Poverty not reduced by foreign aid

BYLINE: Hristos Doucouliagos. Hristos Doucouliagos is a professor of economics

Poverty is one of the largest problems facing mankind, and all developed
countries give foreign (development) aid in an attempt to reduce poverty in less
developed countries.

Indeed, the Australian government has promised to increase its share of
development aid to 0.5 per cent of gross national income by 2015. This raises
the hope of a better world.

But when the empirical literature on foreign aid is examined, a clear and
uncomfortable pattern emerges: after 40 years and billions and billions of
dollars, the evidence shows that aid has not been effective at alleviating
poverty.

Development aid programs, begun during the 1960s, were meant to generate
development. Instead they have generated a large body of academic literature on
foreign aid.

It has been widely known for years that if one looks at the raw data, foreign
aid has had no impact on economic growth. Consequently, rather than search for
more effective ways to employ development aid and reduce global poverty,
numerous studies have been conducted to demonstrate that aid has some benefit.

But the results from our analysis of 97 studies are disappointing. The effect of
aid on its prime objective - to stimulate national investment and economic
growth - is small and of little economic significance.

Both aid agencies and recipients have now had more than 40 years of experience
so you would expect the processes of learning by doing and/or trial and error
should have improved their ability to effectively use aid to reduce poverty.
However, with the accumulation of more data, the case for foreign aid has
gradually grown worse.

Most religions advocate giving aid to the poor, along with idealists such as
Bono and Jeffrey Sachs. Helping the poor is generally considered to be good in a
hard and often unequal world. So it is a tragedy if aid doesn't work.

The evidence does not suggest that aid harms developing nations, and many
projects have improved the welfare of specific communities. However, at the
national level there is no evidence that aid has actually benefited developing
nations.

Sellers tend to polish their goods to make them as shiny as possible to attract
customers.

Considering the issues involved, it is not surprising that many studies claim
that aid works. Many donors want to believe this. However, such claims and
beliefs may reduce the urge and urgency to search for better ways to use aid
money and better ways to eradicate poverty.

Development aid has proved difficult to get right. When something is difficult,
it is of paramount importance that it is transparent - that it is done by
simple, clear and easily controllable rules. But the allocation of development
aid is surrounded by complex politics. Even if it would cost some support in the
short term, accepting that foreign aid has failed might contribute to the
development of more effective ways to employ development aid and reduce global
poverty.

It's easy to hear what you've been missing

BYLINE: EVANGELINEMITCHELL McClatchy Newspapers

SECTION: LIFE; Pg. 1C

WALNUT CREEK, Calif. - If your hearing isn't as good as it used to be, you may
be thinking about getting a hearing aid.

Then again, there's a good chance you can't be bothered, even though you find
yourself cranking up the volume on the TV set or asking a friend sitting next to
you to speak up. If so, you are not alone.

More often than not, people put off getting a hearing aid after they first
notice it's getting harder to hear, said East Bay, Calif., audiologist Leigh
Kjeldsen "People wait an average of seven years between knowing they have a
problem with hearing and doing something about it."

Why the wait?

"People don't know about the process and don't know where to begin," said
Kjeldsen, owner of Valley Audiology, which has offices in Concord, Calif., and
Walnut Creek, Calif.

The first step is to get your hearing tested by a hearing professional. That's
followed by more evaluations to help the patient determine what type of hearing
aid would best fit his or her hearing needs. Once a hearing aid is selected,
there is a fitting, which involves adjusting the hearing aid to best meet the
patient's hearing needs. Often, patients come back for further adjustments after
the initial fitting.

While a hearing aid can indeed improve your life by improving your ability to
hear, they are not cheap. The cost of a quality analogy hearing aid can go from
$900 to $1200 while a digital aid can range from $1,300 to $3,000, according to
the Mayo Clinic Web site. And that's just for one.

"Some people need one, some people need two," depending on their hearing needs,
said Kjeldsen.

Digital hearing aids, which are programmed by a computer, allows for more
flexibility and fine-tuning of the hearing aid so that it can be adjusted to
hearing fluctuations of the user as well as different hearing environments.

"Hearing aids nowadays I like to think of them as miniature computers. They are
programmed for each individual's hearing loss ... It's not one size fits all.
... Once the hearing aid is programmed, it can be reprogrammed," said Green.

Today, requests for analog hearing aids are rare, said Kjeldsen.

"Just about all the hearing aids sold these days are digital," she said. "I
would say in the last five years there have been incredible advances in what a
(digital) hearing aid can do."

Hearing aids cover a wide range when it comes to prices.

"People need to know there is a very wide range of cost per hearing aid, and
that all depends on the level of technology," said Robert Green, an audiologist
at Alta Bates Summit Medical Center. Smaller, less visible hearing aids tend to
cost more than larger ones, he said.

Hearing aids may need to be replaced after several years of use to accommodate a
person's changing hearing needs. However, digital aids have more flexibility
when it comes to programming to adapt to a person's changing hearing needs.

Not only are hearing aids expensive, but Medicare won't pay for them. That means
people have to either buy a hearing aid as an out-of-pocket expense or have
supplemental Medicare or retiree insurance to help foot the bill. Some financial
assistance programs to help people buy hearing aids may be available from
nonprofit and government agencies.

Hearing loss affects more than 28 million Americans, including nearly 6 million
children.

With baby boomers (those born between 1946 and 1964) starting to turn 60 last
year, the number of people with hearing loss is expected to nearly double by the
year 2030, according to the Hearing Loss Association of America. The likelihood
of losing your hearing increases as you get older, with up to one in three
people older than 65 having some kind of hearing loss, according to the
Association.

Although 95 percent of Americans with hearing loss can be successfully treated
with hearing aids, only 22 percent (or 6.35 million individuals) currently use
hearing aids.

"Hearings aids are very expensive, so a lot of people are convinced they are not
going to get value for what the are paying. There is a lot of skepticism," said
Green.

In California, consumers can obtain hearing aids from three kinds of hearing aid
dispensers: hearing aid specialists, dispensing audiologists or a physician
licensed as a hearing aid dispenser.

All three types of hearing aid dispensers have to be licensed and pass written
and practical examinations related to their field.

Audiologists are required to have at least a master's degree related to
audiology (an educational requirement that is in the process of being upgraded
to a doctoral level). To become a licensed hearing aid specialist requires a
high school degree and working under the supervision of a licensed hearing aid
dispenser for at least three years.

When choosing a hearing aid dispenser, it's good idea to get recommendations
from friends. Senior citizens might want to check with a local senior club.
Also, check with your local Better Business Bureau to see if any complaints have
been filed.

Many hearing aid sales are the result of referrals made by primary care doctors
or a friend or family member that has come to Valley Audiology, said Kjeldsen.

But there are also times when a person with a hearing problem is brought in by a
spouse or child who will say "'she just can't hear any more,"' said Green.

"What is at the heart of this whole process is whether or not the person (with
the hearing problem) is actually ready for (a hearing aid). She is the one who
is going to wear it. She is the one who has to make the decision. ... It's not
something people are kind of excited about but for a lot of people it's a
necessity."

10 ways you can 'talk' about AIDS

SECTION: Pg. 42

LENGTH: 421  words


FRIDAY is World AIDS Day, and Australians are being asked to ''talk about HIV/
AIDS'' to help reduce stigma and discrimination against the more than 13,000
Australians who are living with HIV/AIDS. Here are 10 things you can do to
observe World AIDS Day this year:

Buy a Red Ribbon

The Red Ribbon has been the international symbol of AIDS awareness for 15 years.
If someone asks you about your Red Ribbon, tell them why you're supporting
people living with HIV/AIDS on World AIDS Day.

Get informed

Every minute, 10 people are infected with HIV around the world. Learn more about
HIV/AIDS by visiting www.worldaidsday. org.au . Use the links on the website and
spend some time surfing the net to find out how HIV impacts on peoples' lives in
Australia and across the globe.

Join the global conversation

Make a personal promise at www.worldaidscampaign.net and join people from around
the world who have joined the global conversation about HIV/AIDS and taken
action.

Talk about it!

Once you're armed with some facts, start to talk about it. More than 40 million
people live with HIV/AIDS worldwide. Ask your friends if they know how many
people have HIV/AIDS around the world. Talk to your family, friends and work
colleagues openly about HIV, AIDS and safer sex.

Contact your local AIDS council

Support your local HIV/AIDS organisation with a donation or show your support by
volunteering your time.

Ask a younger person what they think

According to the United Nations, at the end of 2004 there were an estimated 2.2
million children under 15 years living with HIV/AIDS. Ask your teenage kids, or
your younger brother or sister what they know about HIV/AIDS. Encourage them to
talk openly about HIV/AIDS and educate them about how to protect themselves.

Attend AIDS Awareness event

There are many World AIDS Day or AIDS awareness week events. If there isn't an
event nearby, why not organise your own fund-raising event and get a group of
friends together for a barbecue or lunch. Check www.worldaidsday.org.au or
contact your local AIDS council for event details/ ideas.

Use what you know

Use the information you have found to help break down the stigma and
discrimination surrounding HIV/AIDS. Remember HIV doesn't discriminate. Do you?

Use a condom

If you are sexually active, the best way to stop HIV being passed on is to use a
condom.

Write to a politician

Take a minute to write to your mayor or councillor, State or Federal MP, and ask
him or her to wear a Red Ribbon during AIDS Awareness Week or to lobby for
greater funding for HIV/AIDS.

Yes, Jews have AIDS

BYLINE: VIVA SARAH PRESS

SECTION: FEATURES; Pg. 18

LENGTH: 4927 words



HIGHLIGHT: Is Israel doing enough to stop the spread of the deadly disease? 'If
you say you have cancer, people will pity you. But if you say you have AIDS, not
only will people not accept you, they'll discriminate against you.' Three boxes
at end of text.


Two years. That's the insurance policy Tel Aviv resident Orit Levy (not her real
name) took out for a washing machine she recently purchased. While to most, this
undertaking may sound trivial, for Levy it was a giant step.

Levy is an Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) carrier. When she was
diagnosed with the illness 15 years ago, she thought her days were numbered.

"I was shell-shocked when told I was positive," recalls Levy, a teacher. "I
thought I was handed a death sentence."

Today, her close friends and colleagues know she's infected. But many Israelis
still believe AIDS only affects risk groups such as homosexuals, drug users,
Third World immigrants and prostitutes.

From dentists who refuse to treat HIV patients to hospitals that single out AIDS
patients with a bio-hazard sticker on their beds, the situation in Israel proves
that AIDS is not only a physical disease but also a social one.

"Unless I'm accepted by society as an equal, I am not disclosing my status. I
have a right to live like any other person," says Levy, in an interview at her
Tel Aviv apartment. "I have to live in this country, and unless I'm accepted
fully, I don't feel as though anyone has the right to say I have to disclose my
status. It's called the law of privacy."

Jony Jerusalem (his web tag) is one of the most outspoken AIDS activists in the
country. He has publicly documented his battle with the illness on Web sites,
through Internet forums, and has lectured in schools. He protects his true
identity because he knows his job and daily life would be in danger if his AIDS
status was known.

"In 2005, Israelis still see AIDS as leprous. I've chosen whom to tell and whom
not to tell. Society isn't ready for AIDS carriers to be open," says Jerusalem,
a clerk in the capital. "You can say you have cancer and people will pity you.
But if you say you have AIDS, not only will people not accept you, but they'll
discriminate against you. They see you as different, not as an equal."

The first case of AIDS in Israel was diagnosed in 1980, and 25 years later, the
mention of the virus is still an anathema.

In Israel, AIDS has been relegated to a once-a-year issue.

"We have a problem in Israel that there's only one day where we publish AIDS
information and have a national campaign [December 1, World AIDS day]. And if
there are other political events on that day, nobody will pay attention to the
AIDS issue," says Dr. Dan Turner, director of the AIDS Center at Tel Aviv
Sourasky Medical Center. "When you talk to people in Canada or the US or Europe,
AIDS has a much bigger impact. For example, if you go to the theater there, at
the end of the evening, it's standard for theatergoers to be asked to fund an
HIV organization. You won't see that in Israel. The society isn't ready."

"APATHY IS LETHAL" is the slogan for the United Nations Program on AIDS.

It's a motto that frightens those connected to the Israel AIDS community. Many
point to the "cocktail" therapies as a reason for the growing lack of concern
about the disease. The "cocktail" is usually a mixture of three medications that
have helped change AIDS from being an automatic death sentence to a chronic
disease.

"Nothing much has changed for the simple reason that Israelis believe 'it won't
happen to me.' The average person on the street says, 'I don't need to use a
condom, it's not going to happen to me, and if I get it, there's medication,'"
explains Levy, who has lost many friends to the disease.

"Well, the cocktail is not vodka and Red Bull. The cocktail is a concoction of
medications, each one more potent than the other. They all have side effects.
They all have to be taken at certain times. You never can forget it. It's like
living with bottles of antibiotics that never finish."

Side effects of the cocktail include nerve damage, weakened bones, an
accumulation of fat in the neck and abdomen and diabetes. Many people also
develop dangerously high levels of cholesterol and other lipids in the blood.

Today, the terms HIV and AIDS are used interchangeably. HIV (human
immunodeficiency virus) is the virus that causes AIDS. AIDS is the disease
characterized by a weakening of the immune system, and the development of
certain infections.

When the illness first came to light, HIV and AIDS carriers were separated by
how long they had to live. As soon as a patient was diagnosed by doctors as
having AIDS, he had an average of two years to live, explains Turner. Today,
medical treatments prolong the lives of HIV/AIDS carriers.

"People think HIV is safer than it is," says Turner. "People in Israel are not
aware enough about the dangers of HIV. When you talk to people, many of them
tell you, 'I was not afraid because I know there's treatment now for HIV.' While
before, people were really afraid, now when I give a positive answer, they don't
take it so hard because they think there's a treatment. And that's a big
problem."

Global statistics for HIV/AIDS are ominous: More than 40 million people
currently live with the virus. According to UN statistics, last year another
five million people became HIV-infected. Anywhere between 4,300 and 20,000
people in Israel are infected with the HIV virus and/or AIDS.

The Health Ministry puts the official number of AIDS sufferers at 4,300.

"All HIV testing that's positive is confirmed at Tel Hashomer AIDS Center. We
have to trust these results," says Turner, who performs 6,000 AIDS tests a
month. "The problem is that there's a belief that if you have 4,000 people who
are diagnosed as HIV positive in Israel, you might consider maybe another 4,000
aren't diagnosed yet. It's very difficult to come to conclusions."

But Levy thinks these numbers are too low.

"The only way you're going to get accurate figures from any country is if you
mandatory test a whole population. The other way you're going to get estimated
figures, which are probably correct, is if you have anonymous testing and
voluntary testing of a population," she explains. "If there's anonymous testing,
everybody feels free to get tested at any time. In most Western countries, half
the population regularly gets tested so the figures are multiplied by two for an
estimate."

There is no government-run anonymous AIDS testing (see box) in Israel. The
Israel AIDS Task Force offers anonymous tests, but they cost up to NIS 100.
Health Ministry- approved clinics and health funds offer confidential tests for
free. However, one must hand over his or her ID number when taking a test.

"While nobody can see that someone did an HIV test, I'm sure some people are
afraid to come because they think the system is not secure enough," says Turner,
who is in favor of anonymous testing.

"Some 80 percent of the population have never been tested and will never be
tested because they're terrified [of giving their ID number]," says Levy. "So,
if you have 80% of a population that have never been tested, you must multiply
the number of those tested by five."

Levy says the number of HIV carriers in Israel is likely near 20,000.

Meanwhile, according to the Israel AIDS Task Force, the United Nations AIDS
statistics for Israel stand at 12,000. Dr. Gideon Hirsch, chairman of the task
force, charges that the Ministry of Health "releases data in an obscure way so
that it's difficult to know if AIDS is on rise."

Jony Jerusalem says the Health Ministry's official statistics are correct. By
the same token, he says, "There is no doubt there are thousands of other
Israelis who don't know they're HIV positive and for sure have the virus."

"It's difficult to say whether AIDS is on the rise, but one thing for sure is
that the disease is not on the decline. In Israel, in the last years we've
discovered between 300 and 400 new HIV cases every year - which means an average
of one patient a day," says Turner, who has been treating AIDS patients since
1991. "However, proper conclusions cannot be made until the end of the year
because sometimes a lot of people will come in a month and then almost no one
will come the month after. Therefore, it's difficult to set statistics. What is
certain is that AIDS in Israel is not decreasing."

FOR THE last few weeks, every week, Turner has had to say "positive" to at least
three people who came for an AIDS test at Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center.

It is deplorable that in a country known for its brain power, be it in
scientific or technological achievements, AIDS cases in Israel are not
decreasing. Some say the Ministry of Health should be held responsible for its
deficient funding and lack of awareness campaigns, others blame the Education
Ministry for its lax policy of teaching about the disease in the schools (see
box), and still others say it is Israelis themselves who deserve reproaching.

Unofficially, the Ministry of Health (figures could not be authoritatively
corroborated) allocates NIS 120-140 million towards AIDS care and prevention.
That sum includes the amount of money paid to health funds to cover the costs of
AIDS carriers' medications.

Hirsch notes that in most countries in the West, as well as in Thailand and
Mexico, one third of the national expenditure on HIV and AIDS is used towards
prevention.

"In Israel, it's a terrifying ratio of less than one percent of the HIV/AIDS
budget," says Hirsch. "It costs $1 million for a lifetime treatment of an AIDS
carrier. Therefore, every person educated about the illness and thus rescued
from infection is $1 million saved."

Turner and Levy note that medications for HIV sufferers come to NIS 4,500-7,000
per month. The health funds foot this bill.

The Ministry of Health annually finances a national awareness day to coincide
with World AIDS Day on December 1.

Health officials admit that the incidence of AIDS is on the rise among
heterosexuals, especially teenagers. Turner says Israeli youth play a kind of "
AIDS roulette" in that they regularly have sex without using a condom.

"The figures point to a dangerous trend," he says.

Shosh Zimmerman, acting head of the sexual education department at the Education
Ministry, admits that for the past few years the ministry has been laidback
about promoting AIDS education.

"We see there's a need to update the way AIDS is being taught in schools and
make it more relevant," she says, noting the ministry is currently putting
together a new lesson plan for teachers.

"We know there's a huge difference between what students know and what they do.
A lot of youth know it's right to use a condom but when it comes to it, they
won't insist on using one. We're working on an education format that will narrow
this gap."

Zimmerman notes that this year, the ministry will require all schools to earmark
a week around World AIDS Day in which to teach about the disease. The ministry
is also devising a program of study on "respecting HIV carriers," Zimmerman
added.

"No Israeli student should be devoid of the right to learn about AIDS," says
Hirsch of the Task Force. "The infected are getting younger and younger. We [the
Task Force] have excellent prevention and education workshops that should be
compulsory in the school curriculum."

Zimmerman points out that the Ministry of Education publishes a letter for ninth
to 12th grade students telling them about their right to an AIDS test, even
without their parents' knowledge. These letters are sent to school principals
with a missive explaining how best to hand out the letters. However, there is no
penalty for schools that do not deliver these letters.

FIVE YEARS ago, the Israeli view of AIDS could have shifted dramatically. Many
believe the late singer Ofra Haza could have been Israel's Magic Johnson. But
while the basketball legend pushed AIDS awareness to the forefront of American
consciousness, Haza pushed it further into the closet.

Johnson took it upon himself to clear up misconceptions surrounding HIV and
AIDS, and most importantly, to show it's not "a gay person's disease." Haza did
the opposite.

Haza's "untimely death" was never officially attributed to AIDS, but there's
little doubt this is what killed her. Had she admitted publicly that she was
suffering from HIV, the stigma of the disease could have changed.

"The Israel AIDS Task Force as well as doctors try very hard to change the
Israeli attitude to AIDS, but it's very difficult," says Turner.

"I think that the Israeli population accepts she died of AIDS but they look at
her as a victim. She was in a situation where Israelis say she died of shame.
She was in the closet until the day she died. And therefore Israelis look at her
pityingly," explains Levy.

When Levy told her children that she was a carrier, they were stunned. Over the
years, they've learned tolerance.

"My goal in life is that they accept me for who I am," she says. "I am foremost
a woman, secondly I'm a mother, thirdly I'm both of those living with HIV. As
much as I try and accept them, they have to learn to accept me. I do not have to
ram it down their throats every day, but it's something they have to live with,
just as it's something I have to live with.

"If Haza would have said 'I'm a woman, a singer, someone talented, I'm like
anybody else and it happened to me,' it would have hit the Israeli population,"
says Levy. "The whole thing of her dying of shame was very useful to the Israeli
population. She became something they cannot identify with, she was a victim,
and she was a one-off. It's the ostrich approach - burying heads in the sand. It
is easy to say there was only one person, it was Ofra Haza, and there are no
other women in this situation."

Levy, one of the co-founders of the Israel AIDS Task Force, says Haza was a
missed opportunity.

"She could have done miraculous things in this country. She could have helped
the women in the country face it rather than deny it. Unless there's going to be
another celebrity like her, Israelis are going to carry on putting their heads
in the sand. With Israeli society, unless it happened to you or someone close to
you, it isn't your problem."

AT THE end of July, the Israel AIDS Task Force initiated a modest campaign aimed
at the local homosexual community. It featured a controversial advertisement
with the torsos of two men and the slogan, "Every week, three gay men are
infected with AIDS." The campaign didn't make a huge splash in the mainstream
media. However, Y-Net news did allocate a spot in its health section to the
debut of the ads. The article was just a few paragraphs long, but more than 220
people posted responses.

The headline of the article insinuated that AIDS was only on the rise in the gay
community. Tying the ad campaign, and by proxy the report, to the gay community
irked all readers.

For some, it was so-called evidence that the gay community was to blame for the
disease.

"Strange that davka the gays, who are so involved in how they look, don't care
enough about their lives to put on a condom. And not only that, but afterwards
my tax money goes to paying for their medicines because of their
irresponsibility," wrote a reader called 'one.'

For others, the ad and report were blatant bigotry.

"I don't know from where they acquired the figures of three gay men getting
infected in a week, but even the Health Ministry agrees they're incorrect. There
are no such statistics," says Jony Jerusalem, irate at the damage caused to the
homosexual community. "This report says gays are responsible for AIDS. They
unjustifiably put a huge stigma on the community. AIDS is not a gay disease."

The report led with the gay nugget. A few sentences later, it revealed that
homosexual men make up just one quarter of all AIDS carriers in Israel today.

A number of readers took offense at the typecasting.

"What a homophobic headline, why not write 75% of new AIDS carriers are
straight?" questioned one reader. "Instead of highlighting the fact that 25% of
new instances are gay, and making it seem as if AIDS is a gay disease, take note
that three-quarters of new cases are heterosexuals."

"Get real, why not be a little more anti-homosexual?" wrote another reader.
"What about addressing the 75% of AIDS carriers who are not gay?"

The Task Force said its ad was not meant to fuel the gay stereotype but rather
to warn the community of recent global trends. The Task Force runs campaigns
throughout the year, aimed both at specific groups as well as at the general
public.

"We thought there's an urgency to bring back the crisis of gay AIDS," explains
Hirsch of the Task Force's decision to launch its summer campaign to the gay
community. "We thought the most rapid increase in the number of new infections
happens in the gay community. There was an over 100% rise in infections between
the years 2003 and 2004. Doctors from AIDS clinics reported unofficially that
they were seeing large numbers of young gay men come for testing."

Jony Jerusalem admits that "there is some irresponsibility" but that the report
and advertisement made it seem "like everyone who is gay is reckless, and that
only gays get AIDS. It's easy to attack the gay community and so that's what
happens."

"AIDS in Israel has to be treated like a gay disease, otherwise the straight
community has to do something about it," says Levy sarcastically. "They're going
to have to start using condoms and behave rationally, and they're not. It's much
easier to say 'it's not us, it's them.' Nothing much changed for the simple
reason that Israelis believe 'it won't happen to me.' It's much easier to say,
it's still only the risk groups."

WHEN LEVY and Jony Jerusalem were first diagnosed with HIV, they were mortified.

For Levy it was 1990. Divorced from her husband of 20 years, she had an 18-month
relationship with a man she met through work. He infected her with HIV, the
precursor to AIDS.

"The way I felt at the time was a punishment from God. A total death sentence.
People who had AIDS died. You didn't live with HIV, you died with AIDS in 1990.
[I felt] a shame. I couldn't disclose to anyone that I had AIDS. It was
something that nobody spoke about. It was only the three risk groups -
prostitutes, drug users and homosexuals - who had AIDS in 1990."

Levy does not fall into any of the risk groups. She is a heterosexual mother of
three. She does not look ill. She is sprightly and agile. And save for the
cocktail of medications she must take daily, she leads a normal life.

It took Levy 15 years to see a future beyond one day.

"I'm planning ahead for the first time since 1990. Years ago, three months ahead
was a long time. I want to be here, I want to enjoy."

WHEN JONI Jerusalem found out he was an AIDS carrier three and a half years ago,
he didn't want to share his news with anyone else.

Jerusalem had been sick for some time. He first had a skin ailment and then
respiratory problems.

"At first I wanted to die when I heard what it was," says Jerusalem, who was
still closeted about his sexual preference when told he was an AIDS carrier.

Today, he runs the israelpositive.com Web site and co- hosts an AIDS forum on
Tapuz.co.il.

"When I was infected I went to the Internet for information and understood only
that I was on my way to dying," says the well built, stylishly dressed
42-year-old over coffee at a Jerusalem cafe. "It is important for me to offer
others information about the disease and what it's like to live with it so they
know dying is not the only option." And today there are a lot more people living
with AIDS.

"Today's it's termed a 'chronic' illness and not a 'terminal' one despite the
fact that there's no cure," says Levy. "In 1990, you died of AIDS. You didn't
have to think about it, you died of it. Today you have to live with it. And it's
very difficult because you have to have family that accept you, you have to have
a support system, you have to work, you may want a partner, you may even want
kids. It's living with it.

"Living with AIDS is somehow much harder than dying of AIDS."

While in other countries, huge billboards carry AIDS awareness messages, Turner
says that putting "a big picture of a condom or something like it in a bus
station is a problem here because of religious sensitivities." He adds: "It's
very difficult to talk about HIV in Israel. It's not only the government, but
the interest of the media and the people. The issue doesn't interest Israelis or
Jewish people. And that's the big problem."

(BOX #1) What teens know

'I think teenagers know about AIDS," says Shosh Zimmerman, acting head of the
sexual education department at the Education Ministry.

To see if that was the case, this reporter drafted an unofficial, anonymous
six-question survey and handed it out to random high-school teens between the
ages of 14 and 19.

AIDS education in Israel is a suggestion as opposed to a requirement. The
Ministry of Education instructs schools to include information about AIDS when
teaching sexual education, but there is no penalty should schools not comply.

"Most schools abide by our strategies but we can't force anyone to follow our
guidelines. Schools are supposed to teach about safe sex, and within that
program there's a section on AIDS," says Zimmerman. "We offer an education
package on how to teach these issues."

According to this reporter's survey, 60 percent of the youth noted that they had
never learned about AIDS in school. All knew that AIDS is a deadly virus - 90%
cited the virus has no cure and 10% believed a blood transfusion from a healthy
person could cure the disease.

At the same time, 10% noted AIDS is a virus that only affects the gay community.

"Most of the infected people in Israel are not gay. It's very dangerous to say
this is a gay disease and it doesn't concern the rest of us. People are not
aware and they don't take precaution," says Dr. Dan Turner, director of the AIDS
Center at Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center.

According to the survey, only 50% of youth know how AIDS is transmitted (through
blood, breast milk, having unprotected sex, sharing needles). The myth that AIDS
can be transferred through mosquito bites is still believed by 20% of
respondents; while 10% said drinking from the same glass as an AIDS carrier
could cause infection.

From the Israel AIDS Task Force to medical professionals, all note that AIDS
awareness in this country is lacking. Respondents to this questionnaire proved
at least part of the AIDS message is sinking in: 90% knew that the color of the
AIDS campaign ribbon is red.

(BOX #2) No cure

It is not uncommon for Israeli researchers to be behind medical breakthroughs.
Nanotechnology, gene-based diagnoses, cancer research, dental implants, and stem
cell innovations are all some of the disciplines of local expertise.

The No. 1 subject of research in the medical field today, according to Dr.
Turner of the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, is HIV. And Israel is not at the
top of the charts.

"Israel is a bit behind in AIDS research. It could be much more in front because
there are very good scientists here and Israel is well known as an advanced
medical authority. But AIDS is not considered a 'Jewish disease,'" says Turner.

While Israel's AIDS centers and universities are all involved in research
projects, Turner notes the magnitude of the projects cannot compare to the ones
abroad. Many research projects in Israel are funded by foreign donors.

"It's very difficult to get funds from Jewish people for HIV. They will donate
money for cancer, security in Israel, etc., but when you talk about AIDS, Jewish
communities outside Israel turn their backs," says Turner, who recently returned
from a stint as a research fellow at McGill University AIDS Center. There he
worked with Dr. Mark Wainberg, director of the AIDS center and former president
of the International AIDS Society, on HIV resistance to medications.

As a visiting Israeli physician to Montreal, Turner, who is also an infectious
disease specialist, had many opportunities over the past two years to address
Jewish communities about medical matters. But every time the mild- mannered
physician was invited to speak, he was told to lecture about his research on
infectious diseases, and forgo any mention of AIDS.

"Because it still has the connotation of a sexual disease or that of IV drug
users, and is thus not considered 'Jewish,'" he says.

That is possibly set to change and Israeli research in AIDS could now be on its
way to the forefront. The Finance Ministry recently set up a tender committee to
find a scientific institution to create a vaccine against the virus. An active
pharmaceutical ingredient (API), discovered by a local team of scientists, is
believed to constitute a revolution in creating an AIDS inoculation and
medications for patients.

The API was discovered by chance by a team at the Ministry of Agriculture
Veterinary Institute which was trying to rehabilitate the immune system, and
prevent and treat skin diseases. According to a Globes report, the researchers
carried out animal tests in which the API "protected cells against penetration
by the AIDS virus, blocking its propagation." The Israeli government owns patent
rights to the API.

Jony Jerusalem is one person who could benefit from better funded local research
projects. The medicine cocktail he is currently taking is starting to wear off.

"Overall, I feel fine but I'm not reacting to the medications properly. It
scares me a bit. It looks like I have to change medications," he says, pausing
between sentences.

"I don't look too far ahead, I live as if there's no tomorrow. Maybe it's
severe, but that's how I live. I know I feel fine now but I also know there's no
cure."

(BOX #3) The test

Nearly every one of my friends abroad has had an AIDS test. Of my Israeli
friends, I would say less than half have undergone the check.

The AIDS test ranges in cost from free to NIS 100.

It's free if it's done at one of the nine HIV Test Centers throughout the
country or at a Ministry of Health Sexually Transmitted Infections Clinic. It'll
cost NIS 60- NIS 100 if done at the Israel AIDS Task Force.

So why would someone pay when it can be done for free? The answer is that only
at the Task Force is the test anonymous. At the clinics and heath funds, one
must hand over his or her ID number and though medical staff promise details are
kept confidential, many people prefer full anonymity.

"By law you have to give an identification number because if someone is
positive, we have to find him," says Dr. Dan Turner of the Tel Aviv Sourasky
Medical Center. "Personally, I would prefer that the test be anonymous. While
nobody can see that someone did an HIV test, I'm sure some people are afraid to
come because they think the system is not secure enough. In other places in the
world, anonymous testing is done."

About 20 people get tested at the AIDS Center at the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical
Center every day. In late November-early December (campaigns for World AIDS Day
on Dec. 1) that number jumps to 30 people a day. By the same token, the Task
Force sees 20-30 people a day on a regular basis and when campaigns are at a
high, up to 50 people.

Moreover, one must be an Israeli citizen to obtain the free test - which
excludes foreign workers as well as tourists.

For research purposes, this reporter decided to have an AIDS test. I chose to go
to the Task Force because, I believe, a true AIDS test should be anonymous.
Moreover, I had visited the testing room at the AIDS Center at the Tel Aviv
Sourasky Medical Center when I interviewed Dr. Turner. Although more welcoming
than other departments on the hospital grounds, the AIDS Center still had an
institutionalized feeling.

The Task Force is located in the commercial Montefiore neighborhood of Tel Aviv.

Going for an AIDS test is not an enjoyable experience.

The Task Force staff has tried to make the atmosphere as casual as possible,
with couches in the waiting area, yet there's a certifiable tension in the air.
The magnitude of the seriousness of the disease jumps out at you from the AIDS
awareness posters and pictures on the walls.

One at a time those here for a test are called into a counselor's office. Here
you're given a one-on-one question-and-answer session. It turns out many people
ask how the disease is transmitted.

"A lot of people don't realize that you can't get AIDS by drinking from the same
cup as someone with AIDS," the counselor tells me. "Others know there's a danger
of the disease and even though they might not be fully sexually active, because
they don't know how it's transmitted, they come in for a test."

The Task Force has tested people as young as 15.

The only details you're asked to give are your age and sex. You're then given a
piece of paper with a number on it, a test tube with the same number on it, and
directed to the blood testing room.

The blood test takes about two minutes. Results are given three days later - and
not by telephone.

"I believe because of the heavy stigma still burdening AIDS diagnosis in Israel,
people are reluctant to come and do the Health Ministry tests in which they have
to give over their ID," says Dr. Gideon Hirsch, Chairman of the Israel AIDS Task
Force. "In Israel, when you come to have an AIDS test, it's as if you're
admitting something you might not be proud of, that you're an IV user, that
you're gay, or that you're a nymphomaniac. At least in the initial steps, people
want to feel that they own this piece of information of whether they're positive
or not."

The Israel AIDS Task Force is in favor of the anonymous test, preceded by
counseling.

"We don't have a clear statistic about how many Israelis are tested and how many
are not. We know approximately 200,000 tests are done in Israel every year. Of
the sexually active population, the number of people being tested is too small a
fraction."

China awakes belatedly to AIDS epidemic
Thousands are dying, thousands more are orphaned. Corrupt blood bank schemes are
to blame. The government appears to be finally listening. Mark Godfrey reports
from Beijing

SECTION: CITY EDITION; WORLD NEWS; Pg. 12

Shuangmiao is a remote village in central China's Henan province. "It's a poor
town. We have a big population but not much land," says Zhu Longwei, a village
leader and AIDS activist. Each year however there are fewer people to farm the
village's land.

Nature hasn't been kind to Shuangmiao but an official act of criminal
recklessness was much crueller. A blood collection scheme organised by the local
government a decade ago has left hundreds of villagers infected with HIV/AIDS.

Mr Zhu laces the tale with black humour. "From 1994 to 1995, our county set up
several blood donation stations. Everyone followed government's call by getting
up at four or five in the morning and rushing to the blood donation stations in
the city. Local people used to think they did not have to do anything but
stretch out their arms, by which they could make 45 yuan (E4.40) each time. In
fact, quite a number of families were able to pay for their basic needs, their
children's tuition fee and family planning fee if they'd had more than one
child. The scheme helped the government to pick up a lot of overdue bills."

Many poorly-managed blood donation stations neglected to do a required liver
exam or HIV test on donors, says Mr Zhu. "There was no disinfection. One blood
donation station in a farmer's yard was in fact an illegal blood donation
station banned by the government back then."

Ten years on, HIV carriers in Shaungmiao village of Zhicheng county have set up
a mutual help group to care for sufferers. "We originally wanted to prevent the
spread of AIDS in the communities. We wanted to eliminate discrimination and
show more love to HIV positives."

Henan health authorities reported 11,844 HIV-positive cases in March this year,
a huge jump on the 2,200 patients it reported in February 2003. Of the current
total 6,310 have full-blown AIDS. Seventy-five per cent of the primary school
students in Wenlou village are victims of HIV/AIDS and rely on care from
relatives, charities and government orphanages. Of Wenlou's 3,172 residents, 100
people have already died from AIDS and 900 people are infected with HIV.

Members of Mr Zhu's self-support group learn about AIDS and basic family nursing
knowledge from books donated by charities and government agencies. They learn
about other ways to prevent AIDS too and some educate locals about the
transmission of HIV and how to control the disease with medicine. Patients are
educated about the importance of taking HIV-control medicines, when the
medicines are available. Leaflets on AIDS prevention from non-governmental
organisations are handed out. Most recently, the group has begun helping AIDS
sufferers' families with financial aid and work in agricultural co-operatives.

The recklessness of what happened haunts Mr Zhu. "None of the staff members
there were real doctors, the facilities were not clean enough, let alone
disinfection. Our village had over 1,000 blood donations every day. In the same
year, 90 per cent of all the blood donors were tested HIV positive. You can
imagine how many were infected in the whole county. There are now more than 700
HIV positives in Shuangmiao. About 200 died between 2000 and 2003. Many people
don't want to do the HIV test. Most of the infected are young men who have lost
their work ability, and now death is approaching them day by day. Their
families' situation is much worse. Children are unable to go to school. The most
urgent problem is the treatment of children HIV positives."

Mr Zhu wants more medicine and help from the government. "There are no anti-HIV
medicines suitable for children and funds for poor children's living expenses
and tuition fee. There's a severe fear of AIDS/HIV and not enough education.
Condoms aren't publicised."

Prodded by Beijing, local governments appear to have owned up to the seriousness
of the AIDS problem. The country's first law on AIDS prevention came into effect
in Yunnan province on March 1st. Under the law, Yunnan, a southerly province
bordering Vietnam, will support needle exchange programmes, make condoms
available for free and promote public awareness of AIDS. The state's police are
also allowed more powers under the new legislation to curb prostitution and drug
use. The law has made HIV/AIDS control a specific legal obligation of the
provincial government. Also badly hit by AIDS, Yunnan with a population of 42
million, has reported 14,905 HIV-positive cases and 907 AIDS patients, the
highest figures of any province in China.

The turning point in China's fight against AIDS was undoubtedly Premier Wen
Jiabao's much-photographed visit to AIDS patients in Beijing on International
AIDS Day earlier this year. Unlikely allies too have been roped into the central
government's fight against AIDS. Outspoken AIDS activist Dr Gao Yaojie was
selected as one of state television's 10 most influential people of 2003, even
though hitherto she'd been black-listed by state-controlled media for her
efforts to inform and educate people about HIV/AIDS in Henan. Vice-Premier and
Health Minister Wu Yi met Dr Gao for three hours late last year.

Well-respected and China's only senior female leader, Ms Wu has been selected to
head the government's new AIDS Prevention Committee. At the committee's first
meeting in February Ms Wu emphasised the need for urgency and called for a
publicity campaign to fight prejudice against AIDS sufferers. She also promised
free AIDS treatment for farmers and urban poor, as well as free, anonymous blood
tests in areas hit by AIDS. AIDS orphans meanwhile will be allowed free
education, while pregnant women in AIDS-hit areas will get free treatment to
reduce mother-to-child transmission.

In another well-publicised move by the government, scores of Henan provincial
officials have been placed for a year in 38 villages. The same 38 villages have
been handed cash to build new roads, schools and orphanages, according to the
government-published Health News weekly.

The change in attitude towards AIDS sufferers isn't ubiquitous, however. A
non-governmental AIDS orphanage in Henan was recently closed by the Ministry of
Civil Affairs because its founders hadn't gone through government approval
procedures. AIDS campaigners were angered earlier this year when several Beijing
schools rejected four orphans of AIDS-infected parents, even though the children
themselves didn't carry the virus. The barring of the children was reported
unusually forthrightly by the Beijing News, which warned that public perceptions
of AIDS wouldn't change without government intervention. The article urged the
government to launch awareness campaigns which would help the public "abandon
prejudices and . . . respect people with disabilities".

Zhu Longwei's village volunteers plan to build a small library in the next two
years. "We want to popularise knowledge of AIDS/HIV prevention and infection. We
want to promote scientific knowledge, and make use of modern technology to help
HIV-positive people to help themselves. We need to provide more prevention
knowledge for young people . . . they must be the main force in preventing HIV
and AIDS."

Mr Zhu's group also plans to make a film about some of the village's AIDS
patients. "We need to use language that is easy for local people to understand
and the forms that they love to hear and see to promote the prevention and cure
of AIDS and HIV. This will eliminate the fear and discrimination. People should
care about AIDS patients and help HIV positives. That will not only prolong HIV
positives' life, but also increase their life quality and greatly reduce the
spread of AIDS/HIV among people."

AID Atlanta's chief delivers on vow to shake up agency;
Jane Carr said the process would be painful as she focused on getting the
organization back to serving people with the disease.

BYLINE: Holly Morris; STAFF WRITER

Jane Carr promised to pry AID Atlanta "out of its ivory tower" and get it back
to work serving people with AIDS when she took charge of the state's oldest and
largest AIDS agency in December.

Like the no-nonsense public health nurse she is, she warned her staff the
process wouldn't be painless. She was right.

Jeff Graham, a former street AIDS activist who has been one of AID Atlanta's
harshest critics, is impressed. "What I think she's trying to do," he said, "is
completely reinvent the organization."

Already, Carr has laid off four middle managers to offset a $ 200,000 revenue
shortfall. She fired the agency's outside public relations firm, which she felt
was ineffective. This week, a pink slip went to Miller/Zeichik, the Los
Angeles-based firm that produced Atlanta's AIDS walk, the major fund-raiser for
AID Atlanta and other local AIDS service organizations.

Saying Miller/Zeichik's fees were too high - 40 percent of the $ 1.2 million
raised last year went to the firm - Carr battled mightily to convince her
anxious board of directors to drop the slick consulting firm.

"Craig Miller (of Miller/Zeichik) . . . got the income up but couldn't get the
expenses down, and he didn't really want to work with us too much on that," Carr
said.

This year's AIDS walk, to be held in October, will be run in-house "with an eye
on the bottom line," Carr said. On Tuesday, Carr met with AIDS service providers
who formerly regarded AID Atlanta with suspicion and hostility, to work on ways
to make the walk a joint project.

In another move to build community confidence, Carr made public the 13-year-old
agency's budget for the first time.

"The bottom line is that she is willing to admit that there are problems and no
one has been willing to do that ever at AID Atlanta," said Graham, newly
appointed executive director of the AIDS Survival Project.

Over the past two years, AID Atlanta's reputation and sense of mission had
become weakened by internal conflict, senior staff resignations and loss of
volunteer support.

People complained that AID Atlanta was white-run when the AIDS population was
becoming increasingly black; that it was "prissy" in the way it talked AIDS
prevention to teens; that it was tying its own hands by accepting grants with
ultra-conservative strings attached. AID Atlanta's directors had made a policy
of not commenting on AIDS-related controversies.

But Carr advocates a carefully monitored trial needle distribution program for
drug users.

explicit safe-sex pamphlets aimed at the gay community, that slowing the AIDS
epidemic is going to mean plain talk about sex.

She plans to open satellite offices outside the perimeter and wants to expand
AID Atlanta's counseling, education, referral and health services throughout the
state.

"I think a regular person could buckle under all these pressures, but I don't
think Jane's a regular person," said Michael Bailiff, who left Childkind, an
organization for children with AIDS, to work with Carr.

Rich seek savings from aid budgets; The Third World will have to pay the price
of Western donors' desire to cut costs

BYLINE: RICHARD DOWDEN, Africa Editor

SECTION: INTERNATIONAL NEWS PAGE; Page 13

LENGTH: 733 words


AID from the rich world to the poor world is set to decline - perhaps
drastically - despite pleas from every global and humanitarian institution
working in the poor world for an increase in the flow of aid.

In Britain, an opinion poll of MPs published today shows that more than 50 per
cent of Conservative MPs believe that aid should be increased, but the Overseas
Development Administration is rumoured to be facing a 20 per cent cut in
bilateral aid in the November budget.

Cuts are expected also in the United States aid budget of $ 11.2bn (pounds
7.2bn). Usaid - Washington's foreign aid arm - is having its overseas offices
reduced from 105 to 50 and its overall budget will also probably be cut as part
of President Clinton's attempt to reduce the budget deficit. Other rich
countries are also cutting back. According to a recent survey by the aid agency
Action Aid, eight of the top 12 donors are expected to cut their aid budgets.
Only Japan, France, Spain and Denmark among the top 12 donors are likely to
increase their aid budgets.

Aid to the poorest countries in the world is the easiest for the rich countries
to cut. Television pictures of starvation and destitution have channelled funds
to emergencies, even though there might be more needy or productive cases
elsewhere. For political reasons Eastern Europe and in the future, Palestine and
South Africa, will absorb increasing proportions of aid. A spokesman for Usaid
in Washington said yesterday that it was not known yet whether Washington's
contributions to the multi-million dollar empowerment plan, as part of the
Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement, will come from a special congressional
grant or be drawn from funds earmarked for Africa and Asia. Next April, after
its elections, South Africa will make similar demands on the aid budgets of the
industrialised world.

Africa, the continent with the greatest need but a diminishing lobby in Western
capitals, will suffer the worst. In its report on Africa in 1989, From Crisis to
Sustainable Growth, the World Bank called for an increase in official
development assistance of 4 per cent a year. That target is far from met. Latest
estimates are that total aid to Africa increased modestly in 1990-1991 but since
then has levelled off and is set to fall.

Next week's annual World Bank report is expected to say that Africa has had a
disappointing year - reaching a growth target of less than 2 per cent - half
what the 1989 report called for.

In Britain, the Minister for Overseas Development, Baroness Chalker,
successfully fought off attempts to cut the aid budget, and the Treasury
projection froze aid at pounds 1.9bn until 1996. That projection is now under
threat. The freeze means a 5 per cent loss in real terms and if, as seems
likely, the government cuts another 5 per cent, then 10 per cent will be lost.
That 10 per cent will have to come from bilateral aid because Britain has
already committed funds to the multilateral agencies.

Bilateral aid - aid given directly to poor countries and not channelled through
the EC or United Nations agencies - is the most effective component of British
aid and takes nearly half the budget. In recent years Conservative aid ministers
have defended the paucity of British aid by emphasising its quality. Baroness
Chalker has stressed that Britain's bilateral aid is targeted at the poorest. If
the ODA budget is reduced, it is bilateral aid that will be cut and, as
Christian Aid said this week, that means cutting aid to the poorest people by as
much as 20 per cent.

A survey of MPs however, conducted in July by Action Aid, shows strong support
for doubling the British aid budget. Nearly three quarters of the 100 MPs
interviewed thought British aid should meet or exceed the UN target of 0.7 per
cent of gross national product. This target was also supported by 53 per cent of
the Conservative MPs interviewed.

Britain's aid amounts to 0.31 per cent of GNP and if it is frozen at pounds
1.9bn until 1995 it will then only represent 0.26 per cent of GNP. British aid
fell in the 1980s and by 1989 was worth only 77 per cent of the 1979 figure. To
reach the UN figure it would have to more than double. John Major said a year
ago that Britain aimed to reach the UN target, but he gave no timetable and has
shown little zeal in trying to reach it.

Bill Seeks to Coordinate NIH Research on AIDS;
Skeptics Fear Proposal Could Slow Progress

David Brown, Washington Post Staff Writer

SECTION: FIRST SECTION; PAGE A4

LENGTH: 1229 words


Can better strategic planning, coordination and prioritizing bring the AIDS
virus to its knees?

It is an appealing notion, and one the National Institutes of Health appears
ready to try as the AIDS epidemic enters its second decade.

The Senate last week passed a bill that would strengthen NIH's Office of AIDS
Research and make its director, if not a "czar," then at least a person with
unprecedented influence over how the goverment spends money studying the disease
and searching for a cure.

Under the bill, the office would prepare an overall budget for AIDS research and
eventually acquire major influence in the decisions of what scientific questions
will be most studied -- and funded.

The office would have no AIDS researchers of its own. Laboratory experiments,
epidemiological surveys and clinical trials would still be done by NIH's 21
institutes or by NIH-funded academic researchers.

NIH's AIDS research budget for this year is about $ 1.1 billion. The largest
amount -- about $ 458 million -- goes to the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases, whose director, Anthony S. Fauci, now heads the Office of
AIDS Research.

The proposed change, which is supported by the Clinton administration,
represents a victory by several AIDS activist groups that believe current
research efforts are hampered by duplication, disorganization and a problem in
recognizing quickly what new scientific questions are the most important.

"AIDS is very complicated, and someone needs to see that there is an appropriate
balance between the various fields, such as basic science, clinical research,
drug discovery, behavioral issues," said Mark Harrington, a member of the New
York-based Treatment Action Group, which spearheaded the proposal to give the
AIDS research office more power.

Many researchers, however, are skeptical that central planning will produce
better science and are fearful that a revamped AIDS coordinating office will add
a thicker layer to the NIH bureaucracy and possibly slow the pace of research.
Furthermore, they argue, the current system has produced an enormous amount of
knowledge since the AIDS epidemic was first detected in 1981, and does not
warrant tampering with.

The idea that AIDS research could benefit from a strategic plan was first
mentioned several years ago in a report by the Institute of Medicine, an
organization similar to the National Academy of Sciences, which studies medicine
and health policy.

The idea got a further boost last summer when the Treatment Action Group
presented an analysis of NIH's 1991 research program at the international AIDS
conference in Amsterdam. The study outlined deficiencies that its authors
believed could have been prevented by better planning.

The proposal to route all of NIH's AIDS research through a single office came to
the attention to Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), who wrote it into the Senate
version of the NIH Revitalization Bill. A House subcommittee will consider a
similar bill on Tuesday; an amendment enlarging the authority of the Office of
AIDS Research is expected to be added as an amendment.

Under the Senate bill:

The Office of Aids Research would have a full-time director with no other
responsibilities at NIH and an advisory council of scientists and lay people.

The director of the office, with help from the council and the heads of NIH
institutes, would formulate a long-range plan addressing, among other things,
what is the best balance of basic and applied research and how much should be
done inside and outside NIH. The plan also would set research objectives and an
estimate of how much time and money would be needed to meet them.

Neither the head of NIH nor the secretary of Health and Human Services could
alter the AIDS budget request, which would go directly from the AIDS research
office to the president. The final appropriation would be disbursed to NIH
institutes by the director of the AIDS research office, according to the
strategic plan.

In its first year, the office would control only about 20 percent of the AIDS
budget. This is because the director could not take money away from multi-year
projects funded by NIH but being done by outside researchers, or from ongoing
experiments by the institutes' own scientists. But as those projects ended, more
of NIH's AIDS budget would come under the aegis of the director of the Office of
AIDS Research, although probably never all of it.

If NIH's total AIDS budget rises, the director of the AIDS research could use 25
percent of the increase to pay for emergency research or help fill gaps in
existing programs.

No one can say for certain that scientists would know more about AIDS and its
treatment today if there had been more central planning from early in the
epidemic.

But Harrington, a coauthor of the Treatment Action Group's critique of NIH,
cited three examples of areas he thinks have been overlooked in recent years:
HIV-related cancers (for human immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS), the
syndrome of extreme weight loss experienced by many AIDS patients and certain
questions about the immunology of the virus.

Some activists say an empowered Office of AIDS Research could streamline
research.

Derek Hodel, of the AIDS Action Council, last week questioned whether NIH needs
nearly a dozen "clinical networks," which are groups of HIV-infected persons in
treatment trials. He suggested the groups could be merged for patient studies,
saving administrative costs.

Proponents of the bill have sent some members of Congress a list of 78
researchers who favor the proposed changes. Among the scientists skeptical about
the reforms, however, are the heads of 22 institutes and centers at NIH, who
sent a letter to NIH Director Bernadine P. Healy last month saying, in part,
that the "additional bureaucratic layer . . . will have the effect of impeding
the progress of AIDS research and, at the same time, having negative effects on
non-AIDS research." Several institute directors would not discuss the Senate
bill, and Healy was unavailable for comment.

Other groups critical of the Office of AIDS Research's proposed power to
allocate research funds include the independent advisory council of the National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the Infectious Diseases Society
of America.

Some of the changes envisioned in the Senate bill are not without precedent at
NIH. Since the Nixon administration declared a "war on cancer" in the 1970s, the
National Cancer Institute has had a budget that is submitted directly to the
president, bypassing the NIH hierarchy.

AIDS research, however, cuts across more fields than cancer research, which
would make the director of the AIDS research office uniquely influential over a
highly visible field of scientific inquiry.

John Bartlett, an AIDS researcher and the head of infectious diseases at Johns
Hopkins Hospital, said last week that although he does not have strong feelings
about the bill, he doubts that changes in the research bureacracy are a key to
progress in AIDS.

"On the surface, this kind of organizational control has an intuitive
attractiveness that can be overly simplistic and actually turn out to be
destructive rather than constructive," he said. "Life is a lot more complicated,
and I don't think this should necessarily be viewed as a step forward."

Aid machine struggles with ecology issues

On June 19, foreign aid officials in Japan -- now the world's top development
assistance donor -- did something they have almost never done before.  They
admitted, albeit indirectly, that they had made a mistake.

In their list of loans for India this year, unveiled at a Paris meeting of aid
donors, the officials conspicuously omitted funds for the controversial Sardar
Sarovar Dam on western India's Narmada River.

This formalized what had widely been known since March: Japan, which had helped
get construction started with a Y2.85 billion aid loan, would bow to pressure
from environmentalist and human rights activists and reverse its support for the
dam.

The government had been forced into an uncomfortable choice.  On the one side,
the environmentalists claimed the dam would displace 100,000 people, mostly
ethnic tribesmen, and submerge 13,744 hectares of forest land.  On the other
side was an Indian government eager to see the dam constructed.

But, conceded a Foreign Ministry official, "The main issue was relocation, which
in a broad sense is an environmental issue."

Indeed, growing concern about the environment both inside and outside Japan has
prompted a number of environment-related concessions and initiatives in aid
policy.  During last week's state visit by Mexican President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari, for example, Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu announced a Y69.33 billion
loan for an oil desulfurization project in Mexico City.

Still, many observers question whether Japan's aid policy machinery, which has
changed little since it began with war reparations 35 years ago, can put
together the policies expected of the country that surpassed the U.S. in 1989 as
the world's top development aid donor.

"I believe their rhetoric.  I believe they're sincere.  The question is whether
they're willing to break through the institutional mess and work out a policy,"
says Robert Orr, an aid specialist and assistant professor of political science
at Temple University Japan.

Orr and other observers say this "mess" will not be easy to clean up.  Among
their complaints:

* All aid loans must be approved by three frequently squabbling ministries, plus
the Economic Planning Agency.

* No project can be considered for aid unless it has been officially requested
by the recipient country.

* Budget requests, environmental assessments and other data are not disclosed to
the public or the Diet until after a project is approved.

* Japan lacks a basic aid law to provide a legal basis for aid policy decisions.

* Aid agencies lack the personnel to do proper project evaluations.

The joint control of aid decisions by four separate entities is particularly
troublesome, observers say.

No single policy, for example, is likely to satisfy the Finance Ministry's
preoccupation with fiscal responsibility, the Ministry of International Trade
and Industry's bias toward business interests and the Foreign Ministry's
diplomatic concerns.

As a result, aid decisions often reflect inter-ministry wheeling and dealing
rather than consistent policy goals.

The reliance on requests from aid recipients is another institutional quirk that
allegedly keeps Japan from pursuing environmental and other policy objectives --
even if it were inclined to.

"Developing countries don't give much priority to the environment," acknowledged
a MITI official.  "But we're not going to scrap the request-based system.  We'll
hold dialogues with the recipient governments to increase their awareness of the
environment's importance."

But critics also charge that the request basis can give the local offices of
Japanese companies an inside line into aid projects.  By cultivating connections
with the local bureaucracy, they can create opportunities to have their own
ideas for projects submitted to Japan.

Complaints aside, Japan has shown a marked interest in environmental aid in the
past year.  At last July's Paris summit, for example, Tokyo committed itself to
a three-year, Y300 billion environmental aid package for the developing world.

Today, the government says it gives more development aid to environment-related
projects -- roughly 10% of the $ 9 billion disbursed in 1989 -- than any other
aid donor.

This last claim, however, finds few believers outside the government.  And even
government officials concede they may have stretched the definition of
environmental aid.

A report by Japan's aid loan agency, the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund
(OECF), includes in this category numerous water supply projects and even a Y2.5
billion loan approved in 1988 for Beijing subway construction.

The report claimed the subway will "reduce pollution from motor vehicles," but
one aid expert predicted an opposite effect.

"Subways cause more pollution than bicycles do," he said, claiming that the
subway will use electricity from burning fossil fuels while the bicycles so
common among Beijing commuters burn only calories.

Environmentalists' top priority however, is not the funding of more
environment-related projects, but rather ensuring that Japan does not support
other projects that harm the environment.

"Reforestation projects are meaningless if the Japanese are still cutting down
too many trees," says Jun Nishikawa, professor of economics at Waseda
University.

Critics argue that in places like Sarawak, the Philippines, Brazil and
elsewhere, Japan's aid has provided the infrastructure -- roads, electricity,
water -- needed for logging operations, industrial plants and other projects
that destroy the environment in developing countries.

Japanese aid officials counter that such projects are not likely to recur.

The nation's two chief aid agencies, the grant-giving Japan International
Cooperation Agency (JICA) and the yen-lending OECF, have both adopted or begun
developing environmental guidelines for new projects.

But here, too, critics are skeptical.  They note, for example, that the agencies
lack adequate personnel to carry out such studies.

JICA's Office for Environmental Affairs, for example, has only three members.
The agency plans to make use of consultants, local government officials,
international financial institutions and others for much of its assessment work.

The OECF, for its part, has decided to rely on environmental assessments from
the recipient governments, who would be generally less than eager to uncover
environmental drawbacks to their aid proposals.

Many experts say a better solution would be to make greater use of "outsiders,"
including experts from foreign and non-profit organizations and the local
staffers at overseas aid offices.

"The U.S. brings a lot more people from the recipient countries into the
planning process, especially the local hires," says Temple University's Orr.
"In Japanese aid offices, local hires push tea carts."

And while the Foreign Ministry has recently begun including a handful of U.S.
aid experts in its project evaluation teams, it continues to rely mostly on its
own officials or "government-friendly" organizations which one government
official conceded, on condition of anonymity, "won't or can't say anything
negative."

Most Japanese aid scholars agree that a number of key reforms, such as enacting
a basic aid law, consolidating the aid agencies and opening up the
decision-making process, will be essential if Japan is to develop a solid aid
policy.

But these reforms will not be easy to come by.  Most will require that the
bureaucracy yield some of its authority on aid policy to "outsiders." And this
is likely to prove even more painful than admitting to past mistakes.

Black Churches Allying Against AIDS;
Columbia Congregation Working With Md. on Help for Minorities

BYLINE: Veronica T. Jennings, Washington Post Staff Writer

SECTION: METRO; PAGE B1

LENGTH: 1252 words


The mother and daughter bull sessions between Gwendolyn Clark and her daughter
Erika covered a smorgasbord of interests from schoolwork to fashions to
premarital sex.

But when the 17-year-old said she wanted to learn more about AIDS, her mother
said she was floored. Not because the subject was taboo, but because Clark's
daughter said she knew little about AIDS at a time when Clark was an analyst for
AIDS education programs.

"I thought we had been talking about the issue. But she really didn't
understand," Clark said. "If my daughter didn't know and I'm involved every day
with AIDS, can you imagine what others don't know?"

Clark told her minister about the problem and the church decided to become
active in AIDS education, propelling their Columbia church, St. John Baptist, to
the forefront of a slow but growing movement of churches around the country that
are educating minorities about AIDS.

Although churches traditionally have been among the most influential
institutions in the black community, they generally have been reluctant to lead
the fight against AIDS, shunning discussions about homosexuality, premarital sex
and illegal drugs, religious and health experts said.

However, as blacks increasingly have been stricken with the disease, which shuts
down the body's immune system, public health experts have stepped up calls for
black churches to use their influence to educate their communities about AIDS
and comfort its sufferers.

In the past year, some black religious leaders in the Washington area and across
the country have started using their pulpits to talk about AIDS. But Columbia's
St. John Baptist, in the boldest step so far by a local congregation, is going
beyond the pulpit to train volunteers to teach blacks in the county about AIDS,
counsel people with the disease and develop an AIDS education program for the
state.

"We're a black church and a disproportionate number of AIDS patients are blacks
and other minority people. Yet there is very little education focused on
minorities," said the Rev. Herbert H. Eaton, the church's pastor. "We felt that
gap needed to be closed."

Recently, St. John Baptist won a $ 60,000 state grant to develop a model AIDS
education program to be used throughout Maryland, the only church to receive
such funding. A church-sponsored AIDS seminar last month attracted about 35
local leaders, including ministers, physicians and government officials.

Erma Perry, Maryland's AIDS coordinator for ethnic communities, said a recent
national survey found 13 percent of blacks knew nothing about AIDS, compared
with 7 percent of whites. Those statistics, Perry said, come as AIDS is
increasingly becoming a scourge of the urban poor, minorities and intravenous
drug users who transmit the virus to sexual partners and unborn children.

Nationally, blacks, who make up 12 percent of the U.S. population, account for
27 percent of the 94,280 AIDS cases, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control in Atlanta.

Although the AIDS epidemic is less severe in Howard County, where 25 cases have
been diagnosed since 1981, the number of cases probably will escalate because of
the county's proximity to Baltimore and Washington, said Anne Simmons of the
county health department. County AIDS statistics do not include racial
breakdowns, Simmons said.

In the District, blacks, who make up 73 percent of the population, account for
the largest segment of AIDS cases. Of the 1,712 reported cases, blacks represent
56 percent of the total, according to city figures.

More than half of the 1,752 reported AIDS cases in Maryland involve blacks, who
make up 22.7 percent of the population, according to public health figures. In
Virginia, where blacks represent 19 percent of the population, 28.4 percent of
the 1,127 AIDS cases involve blacks, according to state officials.

Concern about the growing threat of AIDS locally mobilized the 526-member St.
John Baptist congregation, Eaton said. Parishioners at the 18-year-old church
are "very, very upwardly mobile people who have an appreciation for leadership
on social and religious issues," he said.

AIDS educators said the public awareness campaigns have languished in black
communities because of the churches' lack of involvement.

At the St. John Baptist's seminar one recent Saturday, a minister told a story
he said reflected some black churches' response to AIDS. The family of a man
dying of AIDS asked a minister to come to the hospital and comfort their
relative. Instead of visiting the relative in his hospital room, the minister
donned a pair of rubber gloves and a hospital gown, and stood outside the
patient's door and prayed.

"The church must be willing to take risks," the Rev. Wendell Phillips, pastor of
Baltimore's Heritage United Church of Christ, said at the seminar. "We're the
only institution that can give a glimmer of hope. We must de-mythologize this
thing called AIDS. We must get out and educate folks."

"The black church is 100 percent critical," said Cheryl Nesbitt, the Virginia
Health Department's AIDS coordinator for the Northern Virginia region. "The
church is where the movers and leaders are. Those are the people the community
looks up to. AIDS education will not work without the church."

In the past two years, black churches have become more open and responsive about
AIDS because the disease is touching church members and their families, Nesbitt
said. Increasingly, churches are sponsoring AIDS workshops, walkathons and
counseling outreach programs, health officials said.

But the real breakthrough, Nesbitt said, comes when ministers personally take a
stake in the AIDS fight. Last month, for example, nine churches in New York City
held special services on the AIDS issue. Metropolitan AME Church in Northwest
Washington, relying on a one-year grant of $ 43,000 from the U.S. Conference of
Mayors, recently set up Operation Faithworks to counsel patients at D.C. General
Hospital's adolescent clinic on AIDS awareness and prevention.

Religious leaders said black churches long shunned the AIDS fight because public
health officials refused to include moral and biblical teachings in the
presentations. "We [churches] can't say condom use is first and foremost like
health organizations want, but we can say abstinence is first and foremost
because of the theological base," said the Rev. Roderick Lewis, pastor of the
District's Miles Memorial Christian Methodist Episcopal Church.

Lewis just completed a nine-month project with the District's Office of AIDS
Activities that resulted in a 276-page, culturally sensitive AIDS education
curriculum to help train clergy and volunteer AIDS counselors nationally. The
project was underwritten by the Congress of National Black Churches, a coalition
of six denominations representing 60,000 churches with a membership of 15
million people.

The Columbia church's project, Eaton said, won't duck controversial issues. "We
will speak to the issue of condoms," he said. Homosexuality will also be
discussed, Eaton said, but only in the context of morality and biblical
teachings.

Clark said St. John Baptist hopes to train 40 church members as AIDS educators,
who then will conduct culturally relevant workshops at about 25 churches in
Howard County.

The Columbia AIDS project will be watched closely by area churches and public
health officials, Nesbitt said. Clark said some churches may refuse to
cooperate, but if they do, "we'll go back and have another talk with them."

AIDS   MONTREAL CONFERENCE   Canadian policy held up to ridicule

BYLINE: ANDRE PICARD; GAM

LENGTH: 997 words


ANDRE PICARD
 The Globe and Mail
 When Prime Minister Brian Mulroney addressed delegates to the Fifth
International Conference on AIDS last Sunday, he spoke eloquently of the
need for an all-out effort to tackle the AIDS crisis.

"I appeal to Canadians and to people everywhere. This fight knows no
frontiers. This fight is everyone's fight. Let us meet danger with courage
and dignity. Let us meet ignorance with education and information. Let us
meet suffering with compassion and tolerance.

"And let us all unite, citizen and government, expert and volunteer,
developed country and developing and defeat this appalling adversary."

To many Canadian scientists, social workers and people with AIDS, his
words rang hollow. A decade after acquired immune deficiency syndrome was
identified and given a name, the federal government still has no coherent
strategy for dealing with the disease, the money dedicated to research and
treatment is paltry, and the system for distributing that money is in
chaos, says Dr. Norbert Gilmore, former chairman of the National Advisory
Committee on AIDS.

"The whole world's watching. Mulroney, you've left us to die," a gourp
of poeple with AIDS chanted as the Prime Minister left the stage.

The next day, scientist David Suzuki took up the theme. "The failure of
the federal and provinical health ministries to deal with the subject of
AIDS in a straightforward and blunt way, and to provide proper health care
to AIDS patients, is nothing short of criminal," he said.

Mr. Suzuki said that, although the number of people with AIDS is
growing exponentially, the government has come up with only "Band-Aid
solution.

As of June 5, the day the international conference opened, 2,736
Canadians had been diagnosed with AIDS, and 1,564 of them had died. An
estimated 50,000 more Canadians carry the human immunodeficiency virus, a
precursor to AIDS. The number of people with AIDS is doubling every 18
months and is expected to exceed 10,000 by 1992.

The federal government annnounced a $39-million AIDS budget in 1986,
and last year boosted spending by $129-million over five years. This
includes $48-million for education, $35-million for research, $20-million
for communuity-based groups, $10-million each for health and social
services and the Federal Centre for AIDS in Ottawa. Spending on
international efforts has been increased by $6-million, bringing Canada's
contribution to fighting the AIDS epidemic in the Third World to about
$60-million.

"I think the response has been very adequate," Dr. Alastair Clayton,
director-general of the Federal Centre for AIDS, said in an interview. "Of
course, there is never enough money to do everything, particularly when
you're dealing with a syndrome that has no cure and no vaccine.

"The frustration of dealing with that situation makes people angry and
they want to blame someone, so they blame the government."

Richard Burzynski, executive director of the Canadian AIDS Society in
Ottawa, said that while money is a major problem, even more serious is the
lack of planning. "The government has absolutely no strategy, no vision
for dealing with AIDS in the long term," he said.

"The challenge today is to figure out where we're going. Frankly, it's
something that should have been done eight years ago."

The government said last year that there would be a national AIDS plan
starting in 1989, but nothing official has been put in place yet. "We know
where we're going," Dr. Clayton said, "but we also know the constraints."

Mr. Burzynski, after years of pessimism, has recently become more
hopeful. The source of his optimism is Perrin Beatty, federal Minister of
Health and Welfare. "Mr. Beatty has earned our respect by not
showboating,' Mr. Burzynski said. 'He said privately that Canada has
failed to deal properly with AIDS and that we have no plan. I think he is
very sincere and very concerned."

Since his appointment, Mr. Beatty has unveiled a policy on AIDS in the
workplace, an anti-discrimination plan that is the envy of many countries.
He has promised to add people with AIDS to the national advisory
committee, and to work to make experimental drugs available more quickly.
He has hinted that the government will compensate hemophiliacs who
contracted AIDS from tainted blood products.

On Friday, he vowed that the government's long-awaited strategy would
be in place by the end of the year.

Donald de Gagnee, director of the Vancouver Persons with AIDS Society,
said people working at the grassroots level "are tired of hearing these
lovely words about collaboration and commitment. We want to see some
action."

He said Mr. Mulroney's speech about the civil rights of people with
AIDS and HIV was hypocritical because they can be refused permission to
enter Canada. (The rule was lifted for 10 days to allow delegates to
attend the conference.)
   "It is morally offensive, at the very least, to make persons with AIDS
the outcasts of the twentieth century,' the Prime Minister said. 'It is
also inhuman, the sort of blind ignorance associated with medieval times,
an ignorance which should make us thoroughly ashamed." He added that
"education is a pre-condition of tolerance and respect" of people with
AIDS.

Mr. de Gagnee agreed, but called the federal education program a "sick
joke." He called for Canada to adopt explicit and wide-ranging education
campaigns like those of Holland and Australia, and he said more support
services are needed for people with AIDS and HIV.

The Federal Centre for AIDS estimates that the health-care system will
require more than $500-million a year by 1992 to deal with AIDS patients.
Yet there are no provisions to build housing and long-term care facilities
that would keep people with AIDS out of hospitals.

"We don't just want to be patients or statistics out of the blue.
People with AIDS want to be part of the process of education, improving
the quality of life and finding a cure,' Mr. de Gagnee said. But, "we
need the Canadian government to play an important part. They've done their
talking, now it's time they opened the wallet."

Answering questions about AIDS

BYLINE: Ontario Ministry of Health

SECTION: LIFE; Pg. B7

LENGTH: 874 words


   More than 50,000 cases of AIDS have been reported worldwide, 1,302 of them in
Canada. There have been many misconceptions about how this fatal disease is
transmitted. Following is a fact sheet from the Ontario Ministry of Health that
answers the most commonly asked questions about acquired immune deficiency
syndrome.

1. What is AIDS?

AIDS is a disease caused by a virus called HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus).
The virus destroys part of the body's immune system. People who have AIDS cannot
fight off unusual infections and cancers, and they usually die.

2. Does everyone who has the virus have AIDS?

No. Many people are infected with the virus but have no signs or symptoms of
illness. Once a person is infected with the virus, it can take anywhere from a
few months to 10 years to become ill. Many people who have the virus will get
sick. Some may never get sick.

3. Who gets AIDS?

Anyone can get AIDS. Most people in North America who have AIDS are men. In
Africa, as many women as men have AIDS. The virus can be passed from man to man,
from man to woman and from woman to man.

4. How can you know who has the virus?

You can't. Many people have the virus but look and feel perfectly healthy. They
may not even know themselves that they have the virus. But they can still pass
the virus on to others.

5. How is the virus spread?

The virus is carried in blood, semen and vaginal fluids and can be passed from
one person to another through:

* sexual intercourse with someone who is infected;

* sharing needles or syringes that contain blood infected with the virus.

The virus can also be passed from an infected woman to her baby in the womb.

6. How can I protect myself from the AIDS virus?

By understanding how the virus is spread, and avoiding the activities that put
you at risk. To be safe:

* Be monogamous. Have only one sexual partner.

* Don't have sexual intercourse with anyone who has had a number of other sexual
partners.

* If you have sexual intercourse with someone whose past you're not sure of, use
latex condoms. To be extra careful, women should use a spermicidal foam along
with condoms. Use a foam that contains the ingredient nonoxynol-9; if the condom
breaks, the foam will help kill the virus.

* Don't use illegal needle drugs. If you do abuse drugs, don't share needles or
equipment. Don't have sexual intercourse with anyone who has used needle drugs.

7. Can I get the virus from touching or being near someone who has the virus?

No. AIDS is not spread by ordinary, everyday contact with people. You can't get
the virus from:

* telephones;

* toilet seats;

* swimming pools;

* whirlpools;

* hugging;

* sharing glasses or dishes;

* buses and subways.

8. Can I get AIDS from mosquitos?

No. The AIDS virus is not spread by insects.

9. I've heard the AIDS virus is in saliva. Can I get AIDS from kissing?

Very small traces of the AIDS virus have been found in the saliva of infected
people. However, of the more than 50,000 cases of AIDS reported worldwide, not
one has been caused by simple kissing. Kissing is okay, but don't bite. It's
blood you have to worry about, not saliva.

10. I have lived with the same person for the last seven years and we've both
been faithful. Do I have to worry about AIDS?

No. If you've been with only one other person since 1980 - and neither of you
has used drugs - you don't have to worry about the AIDS virus.

11. I am not yet in a long-term relationship. Do I have to worry about AIDS?

Yes. AIDS is a sexually transmitted disease. You should be careful. Find other
ways - besides intercourse - to express your affection for people. If you are
having intercourse, always use a latex condom.

12. I had a blood transfusion about five years ago. Do I have to worry about
AIDS?

A small percentage of AIDS cases were caused by blood transfusions given before
1985, when scientists did not know the virus could be spread by blood. If you
received a transfusion between 1980 and 1985, there's a slight chance you may
have been infected with the virus. If you are concerned, you should see your
doctor.

13. I am going in for surgery and will receive a blood transfusion. Do I have to
worry about AIDS?

No. Since November, 1985, the Canadian Red Cross has been testing all blood
donations. Blood that contains signs of the virus is never used for
transfusions.

14. Can I get AIDS from donating blood?

No. Needles used to take blood are sterile. They are used once and then thrown
away.

15. What should I do about people who have the virus or who have AIDS?

You may not yet know anyone who has the AIDS virus but someday you might. Don't
be afraid. Be understanding. That person is going through all the pain and fear
of anyone who has a deadly disease. He or she will appreciate your kindness and
caring.

16. Everything keeps changing. Nobody seems to know all the facts about AIDS.
How can I know for sure?

Some things about AIDS do change - such as developments in research and the
number of people who have the virus. But other things have not changed since the
beginning - such as how you get AIDS and how to protect yourself from AIDS.

AIDS: The New Phase of Denial;
After the Hype, a Backlash Obscures the National Debate

BYLINE: Abigail Trafford, Washington Post Staff Writer

SECTION: HEALTH; PAGE Z8; HEALTH POLICY

LENGTH: 1437 words


First came the media wave of fear and scenarios of Armageddon, as though AIDS
were the Space Age cousin of Black Death, which ravaged Europe in the 14th
century.

Now, the anti-hype backlash has started, and it's trendy in the press to
minimize the AIDS epidemic.

Columnist Michael Kinsley of New Republic magazine, writing in this newspaper,
tells us that "a year from now, no one will be talking much about AIDS anymore."
Pulitzer prize-winning columnist Charles Krauthammer is convinced, "AIDS is not
the pandemic its publicists would like us to believe."

In the fickle fashion of medical news, it would seem that AIDS is destined to
become just another "disease of the week," following in the wake of previous
high-profile health "crises" such as drug abuse, herpes and nuclear winter.

But if press coverage has changed in the last month, the reality of AIDS has
not.  ?  ?  ?

"People shouldn't lose sight of the fact that the prediction of a quarter of a
million cases in the United States is coming true," says Nobel prize winner
David Baltimore, director of the Whitehead Institute in Cambridge, Mass., and
cochairman of the National Academy of Sciences report on AIDS. "We have a major
problem, and no amount of wishing is going to make it go away."

More than 110 countries around the world have reported cases. In the AIDS-belt
countries of Africa, the World Health Organization estimates that 25 to 30
percent of all hospital beds are filled with men and women who have AIDS. In New
York City, AIDS is the leading cause of death in men ages 25 to 44 and in women
25 to 34.

The "no problem" contingent notes that Americans are much likelier to die of
something else: Heart attacks claim 540,000 lives a year; cancer, 483,000. One
million Americans suffer from Alzheimer's disease. Why should there be all this
fuss -- and resources -- devoted to AIDS?

There are several reasons why AIDS deserves what Krauthammer too archly calls
"its privileged position" in the realm of diseases.

It's new. Unlike cancer, drug abuse or other high-profile medical problems, AIDS
is an entirely new disease. The first case was reported in 1981. The earliest
evidence of the AIDS virus has been traced to a 1959 blood sample taken from a
tuberculosis patient in Africa.

It's virtually 100 percent fatal. This is typical of the early stages of any new
infectious epidemic. In contrast, there are effective therapies for heart
disease and certain forms of cancer, and significant numbers of patients live
for many years after the diagnosis. In terms of terribleness, AIDS might more
aptly be compared to the incurable genetic disorder of Huntington's disease,
which also hits people in middle age and destroys the mind and body. The
difference is that Huntington's disease is not infectious and remains relatively
rare. AIDS has already jumped from 183 cases in the U.S. in 1981 to nearly
40,000 cases today and is expected to reach 270,000 over the next four years.

AIDS is political. Last week, President Reagan made his first visit to AIDS
patients -- children being treated at the clinical center at the National
Institutes of Health. The president likened AIDS to smallpox and polio, and
introduced members of his new AIDS advisory panel.

Throughout the world, AIDS has become highly politicized, raising concerns that
AIDS angst might unleash a wave of discrimination and even violence against
patients and high-risk groups. "AIDS has unveiled thinly disguised prejudice
about race, religion, social class and nationality," says WHO's Dr. Jonathan
Mann. ?  ?  ?

Overshadowing all this is scientific uncertainty. Despite advances in isolating
the virus and developing experimental drugs, AIDS experts do not have answers to
the big questions: How did AIDS start? How fast is it spreading? (Actual cases
reflect the spread of the virus five years ago -- not the extent of infection
today.) How bad is the epidemic going to get?

It is this uncertainty about AIDS that causes the pendulum to swing back and
forth in the public's perception of the disease.

"People want simple straightforward answers," says Dr. Harold Jaffe, chief AIDS
epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. "Is the housewife
in Cedar Rapids at risk? If no, we don't want to hear about it. If yes, then
let's go all out and do extreme measures like quarantine. The problem of AIDS is
more complex than that," he says.

A key issue in the U.S. right now is whether AIDS is going to "break out" into
the so-called "mainstream" heterosexual community. Scientists know that the
virus can be transmitted through heterosexual intercourse. In Africa and Haiti,
the disease affects both men and women -- yet in the U.S. and Europe, AIDS is
primarily a disease that strikes homosexuals and drug abusers. Why is this?

"I don't think we really know," says Jaffe.

There are a number of theories: different sexual life styles in parts of Africa;
higher rates of venereal diseases there, such as genital ulcers thought to
increase the risk of contracting infection; lack of screening blood for
contamination; more frequent use of transfusions and sharing of unsterilized
needles in medical practice, as well as the burden of malnutrition and other
diseases that weaken the immune system.

CDC officials say that at the moment the risk of heterosexual spread is confined
to intravenous drug abusers and their sex partners and the sex partners of
bisexual men. These scientists believe that there will not be the explosive
increase among other heterosexuals that has been seen among gays and drug
abusers.

Yet some say it is only a matter of time.  Even if AIDS in the U.S. never
becomes as widespread as it is in Africa, many researchers predict a slow and
steady increase among heterosexuals so that in 10 or 15 years, a sizable
proportion of the general population will be affected. "At that time, people
will start to panic," says Dr. Myron Essex of Harvard's School of Public Health.
?  ?  ?

Just as uncertain as the heterosexual spread question -- and as politically
touchy -- is the question of how and where AIDS began. One theory is that the
virus changed from a harmless agent into a killer. Viruses are known to mutate
-- the constantly changing flu virus is one example. Another theory is that the
AIDS virus "jumped" from animals to human beings. A similar virus has been found
in monkeys, but does not cause disease in infected animals. One hypothesis is
that the method of catching and trapping monkeys in Africa causes so much
bleeding in the animals and the trappers that the virus could be passed along in
blood.

But any scientific speculation on the origins of AIDS quickly translates into
political tension. African nations are very sensitive about being blamed for
starting AIDS. After Dr. Robert Gallo of the National Cancer Institute announced
at the Third International Conference on AIDS in June that he had isolated yet
another AIDS virus from Nigerian patients, that country protested the report. In
Africa, meanwhile, people were led to believe that the disease came from
American military advisers sent to Africa -- or was a plot of chemical warfare.
The medical and political confusion over AIDS is reminiscent of the first
syphilis outbreak in the late 14th and early 15th centuries. "Fantastic
theories" at the time, according to Hans Zinsser, author of "Rats, Lice and
History," said the epidemic "was started by the intercourse of a man with a mare
. . . [or] a similar relationship with a monkey." The French called syphilis the
"Neapolitan disease"; the Italians named it the "French affliction." To this
day, scientists haven't been able to figure out if the New World Indians gave it
to the Europeans or the other way around.

It is likely that many of the questions about AIDS will remain unanswered as the
disease continues to spread. In this environment of uncertainty, public policy
must be made: How, for example, will hospitals handle the increased load of
cases? Who will pay -- the government? Private insurance?

This same uncertainty also fuels the current chic to play down AIDS in the
media. In the absence of new information, the public is tired of hearing about
AIDS. The concern is that this genre of denial may mask a more disturbing
political trend -- that of ignoring AIDS because it doesn't seem to pose a
threat to white middle-class heterosexuals who make up the majority of voters.

But AIDS is not a disease that will respond to benign neglect. As NCI's Gallo
puts it: "Until we have a vaccine, this virus is not going to go away. It's
going to be here forever."

AUST MAY CUT AID TO PNG BY $150M

BYLINE: GREG AUSTIN Foreign Affairs Correspondent

SECTION: NEWS AND FEATURES; Pg. 10

LENGTH: 536 words


CANBERRA: Australia may cut aid to Papua New Guinea by $150 million per year
within 10 years to about half its current level, according to an Australian
Government official appearing before a parliamentary committee.

The director of the PNG section of the Australian International Development
Assistance Bureau, Mr Lawrence Engel, said the cut in aid would result from the
phasing out by Australia of direct payments ($275 million this financial year)
to PNG consolidated revenue.

He was appearing before the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and
Trade.

Mr Engel suggested that more money would be given for development projects but
only half as much as was cut.

Australia had no intention of replacing every dollar of budget support aid
currently given to PNG, Mr Engel said. The cut in total aid might be as high as
$100 million or $150 million, he said.

Australia and PNG announced agreement in 1990 to look at phasing out budget
support by the year 2000.

The statement by Mr Engel is the first indication of the scale of any reduction
in total aid associated with the change from budget support to project aid.

Direct financial payments to PNG's consolidated revenue, budget support, is the
main form of Australian aid to PNG.

Total project aid to PNG this financial year will be $31.8 million. The
Australian Government only began project aid to PNG in 1987, Mr Engel said.

Australia also pays $16 million from the aid budget in retirement benefits to
PNG residents who were former employees of the Australian administration in PNG
from 1916 to 1975.

It is understood the overall size of Australia's aid to PNG by the year 2000
will depend on how much PNG earns from its new mineral development projects
(estimated at $600 million by the middle of the decade).

Australian aid levels will also be determined by the amount other countries,
such as Japan, are willing to give in aid.

Mr Engel and senior officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs were quick to
point out to the committee that the estimated cut to PNG aid of $150 million by
the year 2000 was very much a notional figure.

Project aid for 1993-94 is budgeted at $35 million. If the estimated cut in
total aid of $150 million turned out to be accurate, the value of project aid by
the year 2000 would be $170 million. This would be almost six times the current
level of project aid but just under half of the current aid allocation.

The Department of Foreign Affairs also suggests in its written submission that
the timetable for the transition from budget support to project aid may need to
be speeded up.

"If we are to develop a more substantial aid program to take the place of budget
support - we need to begin building up the program now and enhancing the
capacity of both countries to handle it," the submission says.

A more rapid expansion of project aid (and reduction of budget support)would
accommodate projects for which plans already exist but for which no aid money is
available, the submission says.

The written submission of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade says
Australia does not foresee the need to increase aid money for security
assistance.

This amounts to $37 million for defence aid and $14 million for police aid in
1991-92.

Many With AIDS Said to Live In Shelters in New York City

BYLINE: By GINA KOLATA

SECTION: Section B; Page 1, Column 4; Metropolitan Desk

LENGTH: 2101 words


Despite a longstanding New York City policy to provide housing other than
shelters for homeless AIDS patients, hundreds of people suffering with symptoms
of AIDS are living in such shelters, according to the city's top health official
and doctors and social workers in the shelters.

Many of these people have fallen through the cracks of a health system in which
hospitals have failed to make a proper AIDS diagnosis. Others are unaware that
they are sick or are hiding it for fear of being beaten or verbally abused by
other shelter residents.

Had the homeless AIDS patients been properly diagnosed or had they chosen to go
public with the fact of their disease, it was uncertain where they would have
ended up since there was a significant shortage of city housing other than
shelters for such patients. Most then, live lives of misery and quiet
desperation in the shelters, alone, waiting to die.

''No one would dispute the fact that there are many people - many, many people -
in the shelters'' who are infected with the AIDS virus and showing symptoms of
the disease, said Dr. Stephen C. Joseph, the city's Health Commissioner. ''It's
a horrible story.''

Hounded by Other Residents

Suspected AIDS sufferers have been taunted and hounded by other shelter
residents, according to social workers. ''They are subject to being beaten up
almost immediately if they tell anyone that they have AIDS,'' said Joseph
McCarthy, an administrator with the AIDS Resource Center, a nonprofit agency
that tries to find housing for homeless people with AIDS.

Shelter life is also ''a danger'' to people infected with the AIDS virus, Dr.
Joseph explained, because their immune systems have difficulty fighting off
infections and they are constantly exposed to potentially deadly diseases. But,
with a dearth of other housing, ''where else could they go?'' he asked.

The city pays all housing costs for only 181 AIDS patients and helps pay the
rent on apartments for another 596.

Dr. Joseph's view was underscored in interviews with doctors and social workers
who estimated that there are hundreds and perhaps as many as 1,000 people who
would meet all the criteria for an AIDS diagnosis in a shelter system that
housed 10,000 single men and women.

In addition, the shelters have a considerable concentration of drug-users and
members of other groups considered at a high risk of developing AIDS.

Dr. Paul Perowsky, the director of ambulatory care at Woodhull Hosptial in
Brooklyn, estimates from his own experience as a shelter doctor that 15 to 20
percent of shelter residents, or 1,500 to 2,000 people, are infected with the
AIDS virus and have such symptoms as diarrhea, weight loss, chronic fevers and
pneumonia.

About half of them met all the criteria for an official AIDS diagnosis, Dr.
Perowsky said. Those criteria have been designated by the Centers for Disease
Control in Atlanta and include a variety of specific symptoms, some of which can
only be determined by expensive and time-consuming diagnostic procedures.
However, many, if not most, of the shelter residents who meet the criteria are
never officially diagnosed with AIDS, according to Dr. Perowsky and others.

Dr. Joseph said that the official diagnosis of AIDS ''is increasingly
irrelevant'' because many patients who had not been diagnosed were just as sick
as those who had been. Some were infected with the AIDS virus and were diagnosed
with AIDS-related complex, a different set of symptoms. Others were infected
with the virus and had a disease such as tuberculosis.

Although AIDS patients have only recently appeared in significant numbers in the
shelters, some experts predict their presence will become increasingly common.

While Dr. Joseph maintains that homeless people infected with the AIDS virus are
forced to live in shelters, the city's Human Resources Administration, which
runs the shelters, questions such assertions, in part because of its strict
definition of AIDS. Suzanne Trazoff, a spokeswoman for H.R.A., said that under a
longstanding city policy, people in shelters who suffer from AIDS were referred
to single-room-occupancy hotels, apartments or Bailey House, the city's only
residence for AIDS patients.

'Referred Elsewhere'

''Our policy is that anyone known to have AIDS is referred elsewhere,'' she
said. ''If Dr. Joseph knows of anyone with AIDS living in one of our shelters,
he should let us know.''

And as a result of that policy, shelter workers said, there were no special
services such as medical clinics and nursing assistance for people with AIDS who
live in the shelters.

Ms. Trazoff said the city had no such services because ''people with AIDS are
not supposed to be in shelters.''

But in actuality, the workers said, homeless AIDS sufferers - who were among the
poorest, least educated and most troubled members of society -did live in the
shelters and tried to hide their condition. They may continue to share needles
and have homosexual relationships, further spreading the disease.

Bureaucratic Maze

Those who seek help for their symptoms, according to the workers, often find
themselves caught in a bureaucratic maze in which doctors are reluctant to make
a formal diagnosis.

Under State Health Department rules, once a person diagnosed as having AIDS is
admitted to a hospital, he cannot be released to a shelter and must remain in
the hospital until other housing can be found.

Dr. Jerome Ernst, chief of pulmonary and infectious diseases at Bronx-Lebanon
Hospital, said that hospitals were overwhelmed by AIDS patients who had no place
to go when they were ready for discharge. They waited an average of six months
for housing, and more than half died in the hospital while waiting.

AIDS advocacy groups have been urging the city to create more housing for AIDS
patients. The Koch administration was expected to announce shortly a plan for
''a significant increase'' in such housing, Dr. Joseph said. But, he went on,
''I don't think it will make the problem disappear. There are going to continue
to be large numbers of people'' who have AIDS ''on the street and in the
shelters.''

Hard to Get AIDS Diagnosis

In interviews, several doctors confirmed that it could be difficult for a
homeless AIDS patient to obtain a proper diagnosis. Social workers cited
instances of patients who went to hospitals and returned to shelters without an
AIDS diagnosis.

''It is very hard to get a diagnosis of AIDS if you are a shelter resident,''
said Eleicer Valencia, a social worker with Community Support Services and a
staff member at Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx who worked at the Franklin
Avenue Shelter in the South Bronx.

Suzanne Halpin, a spokeswoman for the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation,
said, however, that it was contrary to agency policy for doctors to avoid
diagnosing AIDS in homeless patients.

''If we were to be made aware of any physician who did that, we would pursue it
very, very aggressviely,'' she said, adding that such failure to make a proper
diagnosis could be grounds for dismissal.

Home of Last Resort

For some who have AIDS, a city shelter is the home of last resort.

Robert Rodriguez, who has AIDS and lives at the Franklin Avenue Shelter, said he
learned he was infected last August when the city offered free blood tests. The
tests disclose signs of infection with the AIDS virus. He said he suspected he
might be infected, in part, because his wife was a longtime intravenous drug
user. When the 47-year-old Mr. Rodriguez tested positive for the virus, his life
began to fall apart. He was so shocked that for a month he was dazed, depressed
and unable to work at his job as a plumber's helper. He lost the job, became
estranged from his wife, watched as his two-year-old daughter was stricken with
AIDS, lost his apartment and became increasingly ill.

In February, with nowhere else to go, Mr. Rodriguez said, he moved to the
Franklin Avenue Shelter. His cheeks flushed and his frame shrunken, Mr.
Rodriguez said his symptoms make it increasingly difficult for him to live in
the shelter, where the rules require him to stay outside all day. Among the
symptoms he detailed were a fever, yeast infection of the mouth, swollen lymph
nodes, loss of feeling in his hands and feet and a 50-pound weight loss.

'Very, Very Rough Environment'

''This is no place for somebody that is sick, I can tell you,'' he said.

The 600 men who live in the Franklin Avenue Shelter have no hot water, seldom
have hot meals and have access to only one doctor who is there just two
half-days each week. The men sleep on cots about a foot apart on the first floor
of the building, an old armory that takes up an entire block.

Dr. Ernest Drucker, the director of community health at Montefiore Medical
Center, said that the shelters ''are a very, very rough environment. There are
gangs, and illness is a vulnerability. Add to that the stigma of AIDS and you
get a volatile situation.''

Like Mr. Rodriguez, many AIDS patients in the shelters lost jobs and apartments
when they became ill and ended up homeless. Others, however, developed AIDS in
the shelters or in prisons, where drug use was common and homosexual encounters
were frequent.

Chilling Stories

The Rev. Julio Torres, an Episcopal priest and a psychologist and program
director of Community Support Services at the Franklin Avenue Shelter, recently
interviewed all the residents there. He said that although only 4 to 5 percent
said they were exclusively homosexual, as many as 50 percent had homosexual
relationships. Mr. Torres also said that 20 to 30 percent were currently using
intravenous drugs. Others used drugs intravenously in the recent past, he said.

Social workers tell chilling stories of what it is like to have AIDS and be
homeless. Diane Strom, a social worker at Bronx-Lebanon Hospital, says AIDS
patients in shelters ''are very easily identifiable. They are very thin and many
have oral thrush. In general, they are a very sick-looking group of people.''

When shelter residents suspected that another resident had AIDS, Ms. Strom said,
''They are very frightened. They may have shared needles with him and there is a
fair amount of homosexuality in the shelters.'' Therefore, she explained, the
other residents ostracized AIDS patients and made ''the brunt of physical and
emotional abuse.''

''One person would go up to a caseworker and just cry. The other residents were
really making him a pariah,'' Ms. Strom said. ''I worked with one patient who
was a friend of an AIDS patient who was abused. The other residents beat his
friend up, and he would try to help. He referred to himself as 'The Great
Protector.'''

Dementia and Debilitation

L. Synn Stern, a research assistant in the social medicine department of
Montefiore Hospital, told of a 23-year-old man she had counseled at the Franklin
Avenue Shelter who died of AIDS last year.

The man had been homeless for seven years, was a prostitute and had used
intravenous drugs. He developed AIDS in 1986 and became demented and very
debilitated. Although he was admitted to hospitals three times, he was never
officially diagnosed with AIDS so he had to return to the shelter.

The other shelter residents realized what was wrong with this man and they
''were terrified,'' Ms. Stern said. They threatened him and told him they wanted
him to die. A group of residents cornered Mr. Torres on a deserted stairwell,
jabbed him and demanded that the patient be gotten out of the shelter. The man
himself was ostracized and verbally accosted.

''People said really abusive things: 'Why can't you just die,' and, 'Go outside
and die somewhere else,''' Ms. Stern said. ''I feel that if he lived longer, he
would have been killed.''

Many shelter residents who think they have AIDS try to keep their disease a
secret. ''People in shelters are very afraid to let others know they have AIDS,
'' said Mr. Torres. He has seen shelter residents transferred to hospitals where
they died a few hours later, all the while denying they had AIDS.

Mr. Rodriguez said he had kept his condition a secret from other residents at
the Franklin Avenue Shelter. ''People are violent,'' he said. ''Fights break out
here. This is like a zoo, like a holding pen.'' He was once an inmate in prison,
where he learned ''how to survive,' and ''if it wasn't for that, I'd be dead
now.''

Mr. Rodriguez wanted his story told in an effort to help others who have AIDS
and were forced to live in the shelters. ''I have nothing to fear,'' he said,
''and I would feel good if I could help one person.''

much for the same aid as others

After 30 years as Managing Director of some of the UK's largest hearing aid
firms, Mark Moss knows what hearing aids should really cost. He also knows that
if you buy a cheap hearing aid without the proper advice and after-care - you
could find the aid is not so cheap after all. That's why he has now produced a
brochure to help people who are thinking of buying a hearing aid for the very
first time or considering an upgrade to a better model.

The fact is many people who suffer from hearing loss are reluctant to attempt to
buy a hearing aid because they find the whole process confusing and are not sure
where to find truly independent advice and the best prices.

Trustworthy Advice

This is unfortunate because there are many professional independent hearing aid
dispensers who take great care and pride in providing the latest hearing
solutions for your individual needs. However, one national chain is charging
twice the price for a hearing aid than you can get with other dispensers. Many
large companies who employ dispensers are owned by Hearing Aid Manufacturers
chemists and opticians have also turned to selling hearing aids.

Nothing in either ear

The market is changing and customers are getting younger, buying digital aids
for the mildest of hearing problem. Some simply want a tiny corrector that will
fit into the ear and not be noticed at all - so it is practically invisible.
Some hearing aids work without anything in the ear but by using bone conduction
through a pair of glasses. What is definite is that people want something to
alleviate their hearing loss but is so tiny that it cannot be seen.

So before you even think of buying a hearing aid - make sure you're armed with
this revolutionary new FREE Hearing Aid Guide.

Who has the best price?

Dear Consumer,

" I have compiled a comprehensive list of prices of hearing aids in the United
Kingdom and offer you my opinion for the best dispenser and service in your
area.Hearing aids are being offered at huge discount prices but you must be
assured of the right professional after-care.There are now a wide range of aids
and it is vital that you get the one that's right for your specific needs.

At last.prices are now falling At last.Prices are now falling for the latest
digital aids.

Due to consumer led pressure prices are now falling for the latest digital
hearing aids as never before.My brochure tells you how you can get a proper aid
at a decent price AND ensure correct after care from a reliable dispenser.

Exaggerated fear

Due to discrimination and poor understanding of AIDS/HIV, some people suffer
from AIDS phobia but find it hard to get professional treatment. Photo: Li

"I was a very outgoing guy before, but after I became embroiled in this vicious
circle, I became gloomy. I couldn't make myself interested in anything, not my
work, friends or family," the 26-year-old man surnamed Wu said. "Every day was
tough." Wu was talking about his experience with AIDS phobia. Not to be confused
with AIDS itself, AIDS phobia is the irrational belief that one has AIDS even
though medical professionals have ruled it out.

It is also manifested in the belief that one is destined to catch AIDS.One
evening in May, Wu had a one-night stand with a colleague after getting drunk.
Despite wearing a condom, after he woke up, he grew anxious and began to believe
he had contracted AIDS/HIV.Since then, Wu has had several tests from different
hospitals, but the results all came back negative."I grew up in the shadow of a
hospital, in a family of physicians. Since I was very young, sometimes I would
hear from them that patients must do AIDS/HIV detection tests before surgery to
avoid infecting the doctors," said Wu. Irrational panic"There are several
different ways of thinking about AIDS phobia, or as it is sometimes referred to
particularly in China as AIDS panic, or kongai zu. Basically these are people
who are excessively anxious that they have already caught AIDS or that they
might catch it so they do things which interfere with their lives like excessive
demands for AIDS testing (despite repeated negative findings) or excessive
avoidance of people and places where in fact that avoidance doesn't bring about
any extra safety from AIDS and is irrational," Dr. Raj Persaud, a consultant
psychiatrist in Harley Street, London and emeritus visiting Gresham Professor
for Public Understanding of Psychiatry, told Metropolitan by e-mail.Experts
interviewed by Metropolitan all said that there were many factors behind the
phenomenon of AIDS phobia, and highlighted public ignorance of the ways AIDS/HIV
is transmitted. They also pointed out that the discrimination and social stigma
facing AIDS patients are contributing factors.While therapy can help remove this
phobia, the dearth of professional psychologists who are familiar with both
basic medicine and psychology is contributing to the problem, according to
experts.

behavior with repeated AIDS detection tests due to the fear for AIDS/HIV. Photo:

Ongoing nightmareDespite being given a clean bill of health, Wu feels he is
trapped and he cannot tell anyone. "It is unlike hepatitis or diabetes. If you
get AIDS, people will think that you must have done some dirty sexual practice,
something that tarnishes your character. I would rather end my life in a car
accident than let my family feel that shame," said Wu, who once thought about
suicide, fearing that his imagined condition would cause humiliation for his
family.This July, Wu stumbled onto an organization called the Chengdu Fear of
AIDS Intervention Center (CFAIC), in Sichuan Province. He joined a QQ group for
AIDS-phobic people, which has over 1,100 members. After several counseling
sessions with Zhang Ke, psychological counselor and the head of the center over
a period of more than one month, Wu's fears were gradually eased. "As a student
majoring in the sciences, I need scientific analysis and logical reasoning to
persuade myself. After the analysis, I began to calm down and realized that I do
not need to panic over it because I evidently had not caught AIDS/HIV," said
Wu.Raising awarenessSince it was founded in 2009 as an NGO providing
psychological assistance to AIDS-phobic people, CFAIC has provided psychological
assistance to over 6,000 people, according to Zhang."There are no statistics on
the specific number [of AIDS-phobic people] in China, but it has had massive
growth according to our statistics," said Zhang, adding that among all the
respondents, men accounted for around 60 percent, and most were aged between 19
to 29 years old. Zhang said that Wu's case demonstrated a number of factors that
are common among AIDS-phobic people. They are typically afraid that they will be
discriminated against and tend to demonize AIDS/HIV sufferers due to
misunderstandings.For example, a lot of people incorrectly think that they can
catch it from just shaking hands with people who might have AIDS."I think the
social stigma about AIDS is the major reason. In foreign countries, there are
not so many people suffering from this phobia because they consider it to be a
normal infectious disease [and understand its limitations], but AIDS is
exaggerated in China," said Zhao Xudong, director of the Department of
Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychiatry at the Shanghai East Hospital. "People
have attached certain cultural biases to this disease and link AIDS patients
with negative associations." Persaud also pointed out that one theory states
that China's media and government are worried about AIDS, so have pushed a lot
of stories about the subject, which has distorted people's awareness of the
likelihood of catching AIDS. Persaud said, relatively speaking, hepatitis and
tuberculosis are much bigger problems in China in terms of the number of people
affected. But the media coverage on the two diseases is dwarfed by that of AIDS.
The Chinese public seems to be unaware that they are at a greater risk of
contracting the two diseases compared to AIDS, Persaud suggested. Zhao noted
that people should not panic over the outbreak of AIDS phobia. "The situation is
much better compared with the 1990s. Now more people have a rational attitude
toward AIDS. There just needs to be a process to reduce discrimination, just
like the acceptance of hepatitis."Zhao also pointed out that there are also
phobias about other health conditions, with those suffering from AIDS phobia
comprising roughly 10 percent of the total number of people with health-related
phobias.Challenges of therapyLi Qiang (pseudonym), a man in his 20s, has been
living in "darkness" due to fear of AIDS/HIV since last August, when he engaged
in activities which he thinks might have made him susceptible to contracting
AIDS, though he refused to give details about what those activities were. Now he
is even fearful of the words "hospital" and "drawing blood." "Especially when I
am alone, when night falls or the days become colder, I am gloomy all day,
feeling that there is no hope," said Li, who now tries to avoid work or
socializing with friends. Afraid of telling anyone, Li instead tried to find
advice on online message boards, but if anything, they reinforced his fears and
prejudices. "Now my only concern is whether the testing method used on me is
scientific or not, after I saw a piece of news saying that it is not accurate.
If there is no problem with the testing method, then I will be relieved of the
phobia," said Li.Zhang pointed out how extreme the problem can be. "AIDS phobia
can have a severe impact on the sufferers. It can influence their work and
personal lives, and some will find their personalities suddenly change. Some
even hallucinated about bleeding profusely from injections."Li underwent
psychological counseling twice this year, and was momentarily relieved after
talking with the doctors. But several days after the therapy, he returned to his
depressed state."Those who have not engaged in activities that put them at a
higher risk of contracting AIDS find it easier to recover after some
misunderstandings are corrected," Zhao said. "But for the smaller group who have
participated in high risk behaviors, the symptoms can be recurrent.""Having the
symptoms return is normal, but we still think this can be cured," said Zhang.
"Cognitive therapy is the most commonly recommended course, which can give them
personalized intervention based on their own personality and environment. If
they have severe mental disorders, we will transfer them to psychiatrists."Zhang
also noted online sources can often be inaccurate, and cross-counseling using
online and offline sources can cause conflicting answers and increase their
anxiety. "Also, try to distract your attention rather than falling into the
inertia of focusing on the website. Finally, you must trust in your counselor
once you choose one." Lack of professionals After a recent counseling session,
Li still decided to have another test. "I don't know where I can get help from,"
he said, adding that very few medical resources are available."I once posted a
Weibo message saying that I was fed up with the phobic people who came to me for
help. One even called me at midnight. I told them not to panic, but they do not
believe me," said Liu Yunlong, who was infected with HIV in 2006. "Mental
therapy for AIDS phobia is an interdisciplinary subject which demands both
preventative medicine and also psychology. But professionals with these two
backgrounds are rare," said Zhang.Wu is now a volunteer with CFAIC. "After
recovering from AIDS phobia, I got better and have a more rational understanding
of it and I know what phobic people are really afraid of. So after receiving
training, I want to provide help for these people, who have limited options for
treatment," Wu said.

State aid: Commission approves regional aid map 2014-2020 for Bulgaria

LENGTH: 667  words

DATELINE: Brussels


The European Union has issued the following news release:

The European Commission has approved Bulgaria's map for granting state aid
between 2014 and 2020 within the framework of the new regional aid guidelines
adopted by the Commission in June 2013 (see IP/13/569). The new guidelines set
out the conditions under which Member States can grant state aid to businesses
for regional development purposes. They aim to foster growth and greater
cohesion in the Single Market.

Commission Vice President in charge of competition policy Joaquín Almunia said:
"Bulgaria´s new regional aid map allows the Bulgarian authorities to promote
investment throughout the country and further economic growth and cohesion in
the Single Market. It also provides a basis for an easier and targeted use of
regional development programmes co-financed by the European Structural Funds."

Under Bulgaria's regional aid map, the entire territory of Bulgaria will be
eligible for regional aid under Article 107(3)(a) of the Treaty on the
Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) that allows Member States to grant aid
in areas with a standard of living below EU average or high unemployment. The
map will be in force from 1 July 2014 to 31 December 2020.

The map also defines the maximum aid intensities for large companies carrying
out projects in the country at 50% of the total investment cost in five of
Bulgaria's regions and at 25% in the Yugozapaden region. The proposed maximum
aid intensity is for projects with eligible expenditure below [#x20ac]50
million. These percentages can be increased by 20 percentage points for
investments carried out by small and 10 percentage points by medium sized
enterprises.

Five regions in Bulgaria have a GDP per capita lower than 45% of the EU average
and one - the Yugozapaden region - between 60% and 75% of the EU average. Under
the regional aid guidelines 2014-20, areas with a GDP per capita below 75% of
the EU average are eligible in priority for regional investment aid, as the main
purpose of regional aid is to foster the development of the less advantaged
regions of Europe. In comparison to the previous map, the overall aid intensity
remains the same (50%) for all Bulgarian regions except for the Yugozapaden
region where it drops to 25%, in line with the guidelines' principle to
prioritise providing support to the most disadvantaged regions. The population
coverage remains the same.

Background

The regional aid guidelines set out the rules under which Member States can
grant state aid to companies to support investments in new production facilities
in the less advantaged regions of Europe, or to extend or modernise existing
facilities. The ultimate purpose of regional state aid is to support economic
development and employment. The regional aid guidelines contain rules on the
basis of which Member States can draw up regional aid maps valid throughout the
guidelines' period of validity. The maps identify in which geographical areas
companies can receive regional state aid and at what proportion of the eligible
investment costs (aid intensity). Eligible costs are the part of the total
investment costs that may be taken into account for the calculation of the aid.
On the basis of the guidelines, the Commission adopts a regional aid map for
each Member State.

Article 107(3)(a) of the TFEU allows Member States to grant state aid to promote
the economic development of areas where the standard of living is abnormally low
or where there is serious underemployment. The regional aid guidelines define
these as regions with a GDP per capita below 75% of EU average and outermost
regions.

The non-confidential version of today's decision will be made available under
the case number SA.38667 in the State Aid Register on the competition website
once any confidentiality issues have been resolved. New publications of state
aid decisions on the internet and in the Official Journal are listed in the
State Aid Weekly e-News

Partnership in legal aid

LENGTH: 440  words


THE celebration of National Legal Aid Day on April 28 each year is a perfect
time to take stock of the progress that has been made and the various ways by
which legal aid can reach more and more of the poorest of the poor.


We acknowledge the commitment of the government through the Ministry of Law,
Justice and Parliamentary Affairs, and the National Legal Aid Services
Organization (NLASO), in their efforts to expand legal aid services in the
country. The creation of legal aid committees at the upazila and union level had
been authorised in 2011. In that same year, the provision for appointment of one
legal aid officer for each district had been stipulated. These legal aid
officers not only have the power to provide litigation support, but also
alternative dispute resolution services such as mediation. Finally, the creation
of special legal aid committees to support the Labour Courts and the Chouki
courts in the hard to reach areas has also been mandated under the latest
amendments to the Legal Aid Services Act.
However, the gap between law and practice remains as wide as it is challenging.
In a recent survey it is found that 91 % of people surveyed are not aware of the
legal aid committees. Also, 65% of people with legal issues do not do anything
about them, much less seek legal aid or go to the police.
Truly, the task of providing legal aid cannot be left to the government alone.
The private sector, more specifically, the civil society organisations need to
assist the government in their efforts to provide quality legal aid to the poor.
We seek to create a viable partnership with the NLASO through the following
concrete means:
Ensuring the active participation of NGOs in the legal aid committees at various
levels;
Activating the legal aid committees at the upazila and union levels. The survey
also confirms that people seek justice from people who are most accessible. The
closer the legal aid committees are to the people, the more effective the legal
aid services will be;
Creating awareness of the law, human rights and the availability of legal aid;
Using the legal aid committees as a platform for monitoring the quality of
service of the panel lawyers. It is our experience that it is not sufficient to
assign cases to panel lawyers. It is also important to ensure that the lawyers
are providing quality service, and this can be secured through feedback from the
clients.
If well implemented, legal aid can truly provide access to justice for the poor.
Let us all join hands in the celebration of National Legal Aid Day, and remember
the long road ahead in making legal aid truly meaningful to the people.

David Cameron's 'aid for military' comments slammed by range of NGOs

BYLINE: Liz Fordguardian.co.uk

LENGTH: 772 words

ABSTRACT

Deep concern over risks to aid workers among NGOs, which reiterate international
obligations to spend aid on cutting poverty

FULL TEXT

Diverting more of Britain's aid budget to military spending could put lives at
risk and be counterproductive, NGOs warned on Thursday.

Following David Cameron's announcement that he is open to spending more aid on
peacekeeping and security operations, Christian Aid said any such move could
have long-term implications.

"We would be deeply concerned about any moves to link aid with military spending
in fragile states, not least because of the risk it can pose to aid workers on
the ground. Aid diverted to 'security, peacekeeping and demobilisation' could
have long-term implications. The blurring of the lines between military action
and aid delivery could mean that aid workers become associated with those
forces, meaning they are not only put at risk, but find it hard to gain the
trust of the people they are trying to help," Christian Aid said.

"As an organisation that works through local partners, any link between aid
delivery, which should be undertaken solely on the basis of need rather than any
political agenda, and military intervention would make this relationship very
difficult."

Ashley Jackson, research fellow in the Overseas Development Institute's
humanitarian policy group, agreed. She said: "We need to be very careful to
avoid blurred objectives. The military exist for our national security, aid
workers work to alleviate poverty. Just because one may benefit from the other
doesn't mean that we should be getting them to share their jobs - let
professionals stick to what they are best at.

"We know from research into the Taliban that they justify attacks on aid workers
precisely because they were seen to be working with the army. Providing aid to
those who desperately need it is no longer seen as neutral. This is something we
need to avoid, not encourage."

Adrian Lovett, Europe executive director of the advocacy group ONE, said cutting
international aid to bolster the defence budget "would be counterproductive and
is not the answer. The UK's investment in fighting global poverty is needed now
more than ever and must be focused on the needs of the poorest."

Responding to a question on the final day of his visit to India, the prime
minister reiterated the importance of security in the UK's development agenda in
a nod to critics of the ringfenced aid budget within the Conservative party. He
said he was open to "building on" the government's "conflict pool", a funding
mechanism for conflict prevention activities, jointly managed by the Department
for International Development, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the
Ministry of Defence.

The pool, set up in 2000-01, covering Africa, the Middle East, south Asia,
Europe and Afghanistan, was criticised last year by the UK aid watchdog for its
lack of impact and poor management. The government's 2011 building stability
overseas strategy, which outlines the cross-department approach to security, is
expected to help reform the pool.

However, Jackson said aid spending on stabilisation efforts "is proven to be one
of the least effective ways of spending aid", adding: "If we are looking for
value for money and impact then we should focus on programming that has a proven
track record of effectiveness."

Any shift in Britain's aid spending would have to comply with international
rules laid out by the Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (pdf). Money can only be defined as aid -
or official development assistance - if it promotes economic development or the
welfare of recipient countries.

Aid can't be spent on military equipment or services, but can pay for the
delivery of humanitarian aid by forces. In terms of peacekeeping, aid can only
be used to carry out UN-approved operations, such as election monitoring, the
rehabilitation of demobilised soldiers, weapons disposal and mine clearance.
Police training is acceptable, as long as this doesn't nudge into anti-terrorism
activities.

"It is enshrined in law that UK aid must be spent on poverty reduction and there
are internationally agreed definitions on this. We expect that the government
will continue to adhere to these guidelines and not divert any aid funding to
military expenditure," said Ben Jackson, chief executive of Bond, a body that
represents NGOs.

Since the coalition government came to power in 2010, it has intended to
increase the proportion of aid spent in "fragile" states. The UK has committed
to spend 30% of aid in fragile and conflict-affected states by 2014-15.

Sindh inhabits 4500 HIV patients :SACP

LENGTH: 373  words

DATELINE: KARACHI


In Sindh province the largest number of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) /AIDS
(acquired immune deficiency syndrome) patients live in Karachi, as there are
3942 HIV positive and 69 AIDS positive patients in the city, says Dr Muhammad
Munawar Khan, BCC Coordinator, Sindh AIDS Control Program (SACP).

He said that Larkana stands second with 354 HIV and 3 AIDS patients. In
Hyderabad the number of registered HIV positive people is 58, while there are 3
AIDS patients. In Dadu there are 17 HIV and 2 AIDS patients. In Mirpurkhas there
are 11 HIV positive and one AIDS patient. In Sanghar and Sukkur the number of
HIV patients is 96 and 66, respectively, while there is no AIDS patient in these
districts.

He said that 16 people died of AIDS in Sindh during the last three months, while
326 news AIDS/HIV patients were registered during the same period. They include
304 men, 104 women, 2 girls and one boy. Dr Khan said that during the last three
months no new AIDS patient was registered in Sindh. Referring the data of
registered AIDS patients with SACP, he said there are 194 males, one boy, 30
women and one girl AIDS positive people in Sindh province. Dr Khan said that
Sindh AIDS Control Program is running 46 HIV/AIDS clinics in public district and
Taluka hospitals of the province. He said that if any patient is screened
positive, he is referred to the central referral lab of the Sindh AIDS Control
Program at Civil Hospital Karachi for further tests. He added that "all these
tests are performed free of cost, and registered HIV/ AIDS patients are given
free medicines and medical facilities.

He said that in the past the word; HIV/AIDS was a taboo but now this mindset has
changed and people are visiting their clinics for HIV/AIDS screening. He said
that in Sindh unsafe blood transfusion methods and use of shared injections
amongst drug addicts is the major cause of HIV/AIDS; however, the activities of
professional sex workers including transgender people, locally called Hejras, is
another cause of these infections.

He concluded that unclean tools of dentists, unhygienic surgical procedures and
use of shared razor blades in barber shops are also responsible for HIV/AIDS
infection and people must avoid them at all costs.

ANALOGUE and digital hearing aids look similar but while traditional devices
amplify electronic signals digital appliances can be precisely tuned to
individual hearing loss via a tiny computer.

Behind-the-ear (BTE) hearing aids

BTE aids have an earmould that fits inside the ear while the rest sits behind
it. Some models have twin microphones which let you switch from all round sound
to a more directional setting.

BTE hearing aids with 'open ear fitting' have a small soft earpiece at the tip
of the tubing. This can be less noticeable than an earmould but is suitable only
when hearing loss is mild or moderate.

Receiver in-the-ear (RITE) hearing aids

RITE or loudspeaker in-the-ear aids are often smaller than BTE aids as part of
the device sits inside the ear. They can be easier to put in than an earmould.

There are different RITE aids depending on hearing loss and, where deafness is
severe, a device where the receiver sits in an earmould may be necessary.

RITE-style aids are not currently available through the NHS.

In-the-ear (ITE) hearing aids

These fit wholly into the ear. The working parts are either in a small
compartment clipped to the earmould or inside the moulded section.

ITE aids tend to need repairing more frequently than BTE appliances.

Completely in-the-canal (CIC) hearing aids

These are smaller than ITE aids and so are less visible. They are unlikely to be
suitable for those with severe hearing loss or who suffer from frequent ear
infections.

Body-worn hearing aids

A small box clips to the clothes or goes inside the pocket and connects by a
lead to an earphone.

The controls can be less fiddly than those on smaller aids.

Some body-worn aids are very powerful.

Bone conduction hearing aids

These devices are for people with conductive hearing loss or for those who have
difficulty wearing conventional hearing aids. These aids deliver sound through
the skull via vibrations.

CROS/BiCROS hearing aids

These are for people with hearing in one ear only. CROS hearing aids pick up
sound from the side with no hearing and feed it to the ear with normal or near
normal hearing.

BiCROS aids are very similar but are made for people with no useful hearing in
one ear and with some hearing loss in the other.

Win a first-aid kit for your car

SECTION: CARSGUIDE; Pg. C02

LENGTH: 607  words


MANY Queenslanders are programmed to remember the sunscreen and insect repellent
when packing the car for summer getaways but what about a first-aid kit?

According to St John Ambulance, Australia's largest first-aid services provider
and trainer, a well-stocked first-aid kit is essential to treat people when
injuries occur.

As summer temperatures soar we spend more time outdoors. Activities like driving
holidays, camping, marine activities and barbecues increase and so do the risks
of an accident occurring.

''Being equipped with a suitable first-aid kit and knowing basic first aid will
ensure efficient treatment of injuries and may reduce the severity of an
injury,'' says Max Mills of St John Ambulance Queensland.

''A first-aid kit should provide useful sterile materials to treat minor
injuries, such as abrasions and cuts. In addition, it should contain materials
for major trauma injuries including severe bleeding,'' he said.

St John has a range of four Home and Leisure first-aid kits -- personal, small,
medium and large. The kits have practical compartments that ensure easy access
to a variety of first-aid supplies. Made of durable water-resistant fabrics, the
kits also feature handles for easy transportation.

The Small Leisure and Medium Leisure Kits are the most popular choices for the
car. The Small Leisure Kit is ideal for the glove box and is suitable for
treating a range of minor injuries. The Medium Kit has additional first aid
supplies, making it popular with families especially when holidaying.

St John kits also contain a first-aid reference guide to help address common
first-aid situations. Management of wounds, choking and burns are some of the
topics covered.

A resuscitation chart for emergencies such as drowning and heart attack is also
included. These references jog the memory of people who have learnt first aid
and inform those who haven't.

Remember that accidents can happen anywhere, any time, any place -- keep a
first-aid kit in the car (as well as the home) and think seriously about doing
first-aid training.

St John first-aid kits are also available at BCF stores across Queensland.

For your chance to be in the running to win one of 17 St John Ambulance first-
aid kits simply email your name, address, postcode and contact number to
competitions@the couriermail.com.au with FIRST AID KITS in the subject line by
midnight Sunday.

Competition closes midnight Sunday and drawn Monday.

Only one entry per email address will be accepted. Winners will be notified by
mail and published on news.com.au/couriermail on Monday 22/01/07. Total prize
value $1219.15. This information is being collected by QN for the purpose of
this promotion only.

Handy health hints

* Never use cotton wool as a first-aid material, the cotton fibres can cause
complications in wound healing.

* Never put a lotion on a burn. Correct first-aid treatment for burns is to run
the injured part under cold running water for 10 minutes (and seek medical aid
if the burn is larger than a 20 piece).

* Ensure your kit has large universal dressings and pads for severe bleeding.

* When you use items from your first-aid kit replace them.

* Keep the kit in a location where it is accessible.

* If your first-aid kit is accessible to children ensure you keep your
medications in a location out of reach of children.

* Ensure your kit is dustproof and easy to identify.

* Dispose of materials that have passed their use by date.

* Learn first aid. First aid is a practical skill; a person's ability to render
first aid is aided hugely by learning first aid from a trained first-aider.

ACTIVISTS TURN TO UNITED STATES AND HOPE

BYLINE: Lisa Livermore Post-Dispatch Washington Bureau

SECTION: NEWSWATCH; Pg. B4

LENGTH: 1117 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON


AIDS AND AFRICA

NEWS: As President Bush attends the Group of Eight meeting in France, AIDS
activists hope he can persuade allies to contribute to the fight against the
disease.

ANALYSIS: While some critics are heartened by the United States' contribution of
$15 billion to combat AIDS and HIV, many question Bush's dedication and fear he
could offend allies who are already paying more in terms of the GNP.

AIDS activists are looking to President George W. Bush to take the lead in
pulling together a now-disjointed international effort to fight AIDS when he
travels to a summit for leaders of the world's wealthiest nations Sunday and
Monday.

But some observers are skeptical about whether the president will be able to
prod the United States' international partners to open their pocketbooks and
question whether the president's own commitment to combating the disease that is
ravaging parts of the world is strong enough.

On Tuesday, as he signed a bill contributing $15 billion to combat AIDS around
the world, the president said: "In the face of preventable death and suffering,
we have a moral duty to act, and we are acting."

A week earlier, Bush signaled his intent to push for AIDS funding at the Group
of Eight meeting in France.

"When I travel to Europe next week, I will challenge our allies to make a
similar commitment which will save even more lives," Bush said. "I will remind
them that the clock is ticking. . . . I will urge our European partners, and
Japan, and Canada, to join a great mission of rescue, and to match their good
intentions with real resources."

Susan Rice, a former assistant secretary of state for African affairs under
President Bill Clinton, sees Bush's approach as a high-handed one that could
hamper his fund-raising efforts overseas.

"It was frankly obnoxious from the European perspective to suggest we're the
only ones with the morality and the vision to care about Africa," Rice said.

Humanitarian benefits

Part of the U.S. bill targets the AIDS epidemic in African and Caribbean nations
where the disease is taking a particularly devastating toll.

In St. Louis, Maryville University's Linda Lindsay said Bush should stress the
humanitarian benefits of donating to the AIDS effort, and discuss how the
disease can affect communities around the world.

Lindsay, a professor who specializes in global health and women's issues, said
she often stresses the similarities between how AIDS is spread in Africa and how
it is spread locally.

Women in St. Louis, for example, are infected the same way women in Africa are,
Lindsay said. In each region, women contract AIDS from husbands or boyfriends
who bring the disease into the home.

"They have parallel stories," she said. "Just because the target AIDS-infected
group happens to be in sub-Saharan Africa, it doesn't mean it won't happen to
women around the world. It's not remote anymore."

At the end of 2002, an estimated 42 million people were infected with HIV or
living with AIDS; more than 75 percent live in Africa or the Caribbean.

AIDS activists said Bush will use some of the funding in the AIDS authorization
bill as a bargaining tool to convince wealthy countries to contribute to the
Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.

The bill requires that the United States give no more than 33 percent of all
donations to the fund, which means it must leverage money from other countries
to commit aid itself.

Bush's effort might have had an early payoff. On Friday, Britain promised an
additional $80 million to the fund. That raises its commitment through 2008 to
$280 million.

The fund manages and distributes donations to poor countries in the form of
grants and other programs.

Level of contribution

In determining whether to view the United States as a credible leader on AIDS,
Europeans will take note of how much the United States gives in foreign aid,
said Paul Zeitz, executive director of the Global AIDS Alliance, an advocacy
organization based in Washington.

The United Nations recommends that 0.7 percent of the gross national product of
wealthy nations go to foreign aid, though the United States gives 0.1 percent,
Zeitz said. Germany, France and Italy are much closer to the mark - giving 0.3
to 0.5 percent of their GNP to foreign aid.

"They say to the U.S., 'When are you putting up your fair share of GNP?" Zeitz
said. "The world is looking for the U.S. to use its wealth for poverty
reduction."

Though Zeitz acknowledged that the president's initiative to commit $15 billion
in five years to fight AIDS could accelerate the battle, he said Bush has failed
to budget enough in actual spending for the initiative that he's promoted.

Bush called for $1.6 billion in AIDS spending in his fiscal 2004 budget
proposal, though the AIDS bill passed by Congress authorizes $3 billion.

"Is this a phony promise, or will appropriations live up to the word of the
bill?" Zeitz said.

Members of the AIDS alliance said they have been targeting Sen. Christopher
"Kit" Bond, R-Mo., as a key player in securing AIDS funding because he is a
member of the Senate subcommittee on spending for foreign operations.

A spokesperson from his office said the senator supports fully funding the AIDS
initiative, especially because it's a priority for the president and Senate
leaders.

Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., criticized Bush for stripping other foreign aid
programs to pay for increases in HIV-AIDS spending. To name a few, Leahy said
International Disaster Assistance would be cut by nearly 20 percent and other
global health programs would be cut by 14 percent.

"His other initiatives rob Peter to pay Paul." Leahy said last week.

Jamie Drummond, executive director of DATA, one of the only orga nizations that
lobbies for AIDS funding both in the U.S. and internationally, said the group
has been lobbying world leaders to follow America's lead and reinvigorate the
fight against the disease.

He said it was important for countries to agree on how to fight and fund AIDS
treatment and prevention because fractured efforts can overburden poor
countries.

"One of the problems with AIDS - it's been poorly coordinated. If you have a war
going on, you want to know where your troops are," he said.

Drummond said the United States and France could use the AIDS issue as an
opportunity to demonstrate cooperation - after they butted heads on whether to
go to war with Iraq earlier this year.

"We think partly as a result of the passage of the AIDS bill and partly a result
of a renewed French desire to cooperate - and the passage of time and the fruits
of our campaign - we could deliver something on AIDS," Drummond said.

Church focuses spotlight on AIDS

BYLINE: By Virginia Culver, Denver Post Religion Writer,

SECTION: DENVER & THE WEST; Pg. B-05

LENGTH: 553 words


People with AIDS 'have become invisible in mainstream  America' because most
Americans believe the AIDS crisis is over,  said Steve McCeney, a Denver
psychologist who has had the illness  for six years.

Far fewer people are dying of AIDS-related illnesses, but the  number of people
contracting the incurable disease is still  rising, McCeney said.

He said high-powered drugs such as AZT are keeping people  alive, but that very
fact has kept many younger gay people from  being careful in sexual
relationships.

'They think they don't have to be careful because there are  drugs,' McCeney
said.

McCeney, 44, will speak Friday at a World AIDS Day observance  at Park Hill
United Methodist Church, 5209 Montview Blvd.

It will be his first public address about his 'life  transforming' experience.

Open to the public

Friday's event, from 9:30 a.m. to noon, also will feature the  Rev. Julian Rush,
director of the Colorado AIDS Project; Imani  Latifi, director of Prevention,
Colorado AIDS; and Joretta  Marshall, associate professor of pastoral care at
Denver's Iliff  School of Theology. It is free and open to the public.

Rush will discuss the Colorado scene, Latifi will discuss AIDS  in the minority
communities, and Marshall will discuss  congregational responses to AIDS.

McCeney has suffered more from the AIDS medications than from  the actual
illness and is on leave from his counseling practice  because of extreme fatigue
and gastrointestinal problems.

When AIDS 'was the hot issue' in the 1980s, more attention  was paid to AIDS
sufferers, but now that the illness is less in  the public spotlight, 'there is
more alienation and loneliness for  those of us who have it,' he said.

Because Americans can afford the medicine (he spends from  $ 800 to $ 1,000 a
month on medication), people have put the problem  out of their minds. 'But this
is dangerous,' he said, because  doctors tell AIDS patients that they can't take
the medicines all  their lives without long-term health consequences.

In addition, Americans seem immune to the global problem of  AIDS, he said.

'AIDS is raging globally,' said the Rev. Donald Messer,  interim pastor at Park
Hill Methodist.

7 million infected in India

'One in four adults in Zimbabwe has HIV. There are 400,000  orphans there'
because their parents have died of AIDS, said  Messer, who planned the Friday
conference. More than 7 million,  perhaps as many as 20 million people, are
infected with the virus  in India, said Messer, who attended last July's World
AIDS  Conference in Durbin, South Africa. Many people in poorer  countries are
lucky to 'get an aspirin, much less AZT,' said  Messer, former president of
Iliff.

Nevertheless, 'AIDS is not the highest item for Christian  attention. With our
aversion to talking about homosexuality, AIDS  has never been a prominent
subject of our compassion or concern,'  Messer said.

McCeney lost his life partner in 1994 to AIDS and said the  grief AIDS patients
feel over loss of many friends adds to the  trauma. He received a lot of support
from Unity Church of Denver  when he attended, and still relies on his own
spirituality, as  well 'as tremendous support of family, friends and God,' he
said.

Hearing aid displeasure

BYLINE: NANCY PARADIS

SECTION: FLORIDIAN; ACTION; Pg. 2F

LENGTH: 932 words



I paid Beltone Hearing Aid Center in Seminole $ 1,000 for a hearing aid that
caused me great pain. It was replaced with one that sounded like Rice Krispies
crackling. When I asked for a refund I was told I couldn't get one because 30
days had passed. I have five people who can verify that I did not have the aid
in my possession for the whole month.

I have worn an aid for some 25 years or more and know what to expect from having
one. The salesman came to my home Feb. 10 and wanted to adjust the new aid, but
I do not want to go through the hassle after two tries.

Could you please see what can be done? Mary Roy

Response: Richard Kastel, hearing aid specialist with Beltone Hearing Aid
Centers, said you purchased one hearing aid from him Nov. 23. It was delivered
to you Dec. 10. When he visited you Dec. 18, you said your ear was sore. Kastel
modified the ear mold and you said it seemed better. He said he called you the
following day and you told him the soreness was mostly gone and that you were
adjusting to the new hearing aid.

On Dec. 28, you called and said the ear was sore again. Kastel said he took a
new impression Dec. 29 to remake the hearing aid. He delivered the remake to you
Jan. 21 and in the presence of your son, Jim, you said you were hearing well and
there was no soreness. Kastel said he followed up with a phone call the
following day and you said everything was okay and thanked him for being so
attentive to your needs.

You called the office again and Kastel said he went to see you on Feb. 10. That
is when you said you wanted to return the hearing aid. At that time the 30-day
period during which you had the right to return the hearing aid had expired. He
said you would not tell him what was wrong, only that you wanted to return it.
He offered to make whatever adjustments were necessary, but you refused his
help. Kastel said he still does not know what your complaint was, given that you
are aware you have a severe to profound hearing loss and that no hearing aid
will restore your hearing to perfection.

Kastel said he is willing to make whatever adjustments may be necessary to help
you, but that you no longer have the right to return the hearing aid for a
refund.

You did not send us a copy of the reverse side of your purchase order, which
contained the warranty details and other information regarding Beltone's credit
return policy. However, we can tell you what Florida law requires.

In July 1997, the state Board of Hearing Aid Specialists changed the rule
governing hearing aid refunds to allow their return for any reason. Up until
then, consumers were required to prove that the hearing aids had not
significantly improved their hearing.

According to the new rule, Florida Statute 484.0512, consumers must be given a
written 30-day trial period and money-back guarantee, less certain costs. You
said you did not have the hearing aid for the full 30 days. The only dates we
have are those supplied by Kastel, and according to them, you had a hearing aid
from Beltone for 39 days: 19 days for the original aid, 20 days for the remade
aid.

There is one other way a consumer can receive a refund for a returned aid. This
is addressed in Florida Statute 484.0513. The purchaser must consult a physician
who is board certified in otolaryngology or internal medicine, or a licensed
family practitioner. That physician must certify in writing that the purchaser
has a hearing impairment that hearing aids won't help or a medical condition
that would discourage the use of a hearing aid. The contract may then be
canceled by the purchaser, and a full refund, less 5 percent, must be made. The
purchaser must return the aids to the seller in original condition, less normal
wear and tear.

Unfortunately, this provision won't help you either, since the law gives you 60
days from the date of receiving the aids to notify the seller in writing, by
certified mail, return receipt requested, of your intent to rescind the
transaction. That time has also elapsed. In addition, you already have
successfully used a hearing aid for 25 years.

Given Kastel's willingness to work with you, we suggest that you give him the
opportunity to make whatever corrections are necessary to your hearing aid.

Took trip, wants deposit

In October we went to Orlando for a three-day, two-night package for which we
had to send a $ 50 refundable deposit to Air-Land-Sea Reservations.

As soon as we returned home we sent the necessary paperwork asking for our
refundable deposit. Hearing nothing, I called and was told it would take six to
eight weeks.

Then we got a letter offering us a home satellite system in lieu of the deposit.
We returned the lower portion of the letter saying we wanted our $ 50.

We have yet to receive it. Can you help? Mrs. C.H. Maquet

Response: Janett Cooper, refund clerk for Air-Land-Sea Reservations in Fort
Lauderdale, apologized for the inconvenience caused by the delay in refunding
your money. The company merged with another one at the end of 1998 and this
caused delays in processing credits. Cooper's letter ended by stating that your
account has been credited. We hope this means a check has been processed and
mailed. Let us know if this is not the case.

If you have a question for Action, or your attempts to resolve a consumer
complaint have failed, write: Times Action, P.O. Box 1121, St. Petersburg, FL
33731, or call 893-8171 or, outside Pinellas, (800) 333-7505, ext. 8171, to
leave a recorded request for Action. Names will not be omitted except in unusual
circumstances. Letters may be edited.

An agency beyond reform

BYLINE: BY BRYAN T. JOHNSON

SECTION: EDITORIAL/OPINION; Pg. 6A

LENGTH: 789 words


As Congress begins its work on the federal budget, one item sure to receive
intense scrutiny is foreign aid. Despite the overwhelming evidence that suggests
foreign aid does more harm than good, the Clinton administration has submitted a
budget that calls for a $1.4 billion increase in foreign aid spending.

Why would the administration ask for more aid money when the agency responsible
for most aid programs - the Agency for International Development - remains mired
in fraud, waste and abuse? According to several recent audits by AID's own
inspector general, the agency wasted as much as $70 million from April 1, 1995,
to Sept. 30, 1996, alone.

AID has a long-standing reputation as one of the worst-run and most poorly
organized federal agencies. In 1989, for example, a task force report co-
authored by Reps. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., and Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., concluded
that AID was poorly managed and in dire need of reform - possibly even
elimination as an independent agency.

Skepticism over AID's performance has been met with intense lobbying by its
bureaucrats. AID's top official, J. Brian Atwood, recently acknowledged that,
""in the past three years, we have seen major management reforms change AID's
image as well as its operations. As one of the lead agencies of the National
Performance Review, our agency has been one of the most ambitious in all of
government in trying to do what we do better.''

Mr. Atwood's claim of progress, however, is at odds with other reports released
by AID's own inspector general. According to these reports, AID is managed no
better today than it was almost a decade ago. The inspector general's office is
required by law to provide Congress with semiannual reports summarizing its
audit findings. These audits reveal a picture far different from that painted by
Mr. Atwood. Consider the following:

* AID is required by law to develop a management system that ""adopts methods of
comparing actual results against those anticipated when the programs and
projects were undertaken.'' According to the inspector general, however, ""AID
(does) not yet have fully effective systems for measuring results.''

Although AID has developed a new management system, the most recent IG report
concludes that ""as of September 1996, none of the eight NMS (New Management
System) subsystems was fully operational and less than 1 percent of the agency's
normal monthly volume of obligations . . . was being entered into the new core
accounting system.'' Thus, 99 percent of all AID spending is man- aged by
outdated accounting systems, and AID has given no assurance that most of its
spending is achieving stated objectives.

* AID spends about $300 million each year to bring foreign students to the
United States for a variety of educational training programs. This includes
support for foreign graduate students. Yet the inspector general found that
about 36 percent of the agency's graduate participants attended schools with
tuition ranging from $8,001 to $20,000, although the average cost of a graduate
school nationwide is $7,206.''

* A major purpose of the U.S. foreign aid program in Haiti is to provide
substantial food aid to Haiti's citizens. A recent audit, however, found that
the food program has ""incurred substantial commodity losses due to theft . . .
Specifically, AID could not account for 2,732 metric tons of commodities valued
at $1.1 million.

* A considerable number of AID's projects are performed by U.S. companies that
contract with the agency. Although some proponents of foreign aid argue that
such contracting cuts down on fraud and waste, recent audits by the inspector
general have found otherwise.

For example, a Pennsylvania company was hired by AID to help refurbish an
Egyptian industrial plant. The company then hired non-U.S. citizens to perform
the work, paid minimal wages, and billed AID for $98,999.05 more than it had
paid these workers, just as if it had paid them the higher wages.

* AID often provides money to less-developed countries to stimulate credit for
borrowers. One such project was provided to the Egyptian National Bank for
Development in 1994. The inspector general found that $1.02 million of the $3.47
million AID gave to the bank was of a ""questionable'' nature and that almost
one-third of the funding for the entire project had been wasted.

Supporters of the agency argue that these are only isolated cases, but the
pattern of waste, fraud and abuse cannot be denied. Despite numerous attempts to
reform it since the end of the Cold War, this federal agency remains unreformed.

It is time to admit the obvious: AID is beyond reform. It is time to abolish the
agency and most of its functions.

CITY FACES;
AIDS Legal Project's caseload keeps growing;
But its free services could disappear as funding fades

BYLINE: Patti Puckett; STAFF WRITER

SECTION: EXTRA, Pg. 2D

LENGTH: 424 words


Chip Rowan was just a few years out of law school when he decided to help poor
people with AIDS.

In 1988, Rowan launched the AIDS Legal Project, a free program within the
Atlanta Legal Aid Society.

The AIDS Legal Project's first client, a woman with AIDS who lost her job as a
food service worker, got back pay and compensation from her employer. Since
then, Rowan has helped Fulton County prisoners with AIDS get medicine. And he
helped a Clayton County hospice get a zoning permit despite opposition from
neighbors, one of several of his cases that made headlines.

He met clients who were discriminated against by landlords, employers and
insurance companies.

In 1994, Rowan, three other lawyers, two paralegals and a few volunteers managed
1,300 cases. The demand for their services continues to increase, said Rowan,
34, a resident of Inman Park.

But the AIDS Legal Project's future is uncertain, Rowan said. Federal programs
that fund most of its $ 330,000 budget are in jeopardy.

For now, Rowan and his staff continue to accept clients. They set up information
tables at a clinic on Ponce de Leon Avenue and at a home for people with AIDS on
Briarcliff Road. Each outreach visit leads to several more cases.

Rowan has represented women with HIV who are worried about who will have custody
of their children and people with AIDS who have been denied coverage by
insurance companies.

"Law is a craft you develop over time," said Rowan. "What's important to me is
to be a better lawyer."

Rowan is proud of a case he won for a dentist who was denied disability and had
to give up his practice because he was HIV-positive.

"Insurance companies are intimidating," Rowan said. "You have to show you can be
just as aggressive."

Mark King, a consultant specializing in workplace AIDS issues, has turned to
Rowan for help several times. "He is a mentor in terms of legal issues," said
King, former director of the AIDS Survival Project, an advocacy organization.
"He's unswerving in his sense of what's right and wrong."

Rowan, an Alabama native, taught special education before attending law school
at Emory University. Later as a corporate lawyer, Rowan spent his days drafting
long real estate documents.

He soon took a giant pay cut and joined the family law staff at the Atlanta
Legal Aid Society. Two years later he formed the AIDS Legal Project.

Rowan said he has seen most every kind of case that applies to poor people and
AIDS.

"But there's always something new to keep me on my toes," he said.

AIDS ward used for private patients

BYLINE: By ANDY CLARK

SECTION: NWS; Pg. 3

LENGTH: 386 words


A HOSPITAL isolation ward set up to deal with a feared increase in the number of
AIDS victims is treating private patients.

Concerned AIDS groups now intend to question the practice at the Queen Elizabeth
Hospital.

AIDS Foundation, AIDS Concern and independent AIDS spokesman Mike Sinclair said
they were unaware the unit existed even though it was completed in March.

The specialist ward can cope with up to 15 people. Although it was established
to deal with all kinds of infectious diseases, hospital managers admit a major
part of the thinking was for it to cope with the expected growth in AIDS cases
over the next few years.

''At the moment there are few AIDS cases, the demand is quite low, but I am sure
in a few years' time there will be more of a need,'' said hospital chief
executive Dr York Chow Yat-ngok.

''It was not our intention to set up the ward as a totally dedicated ward for
AIDS treatment but it was set up with a view to coping with increases in the
future.''

''At the moment we have to prioritise those rooms. We have to decide whether
they be used for AIDS patients, for infectious diseases or whether they are used
to provide private rooms.

''Because they are being used as private rooms does not mean AIDS patients are
not being treated. They are being treated in various wards whenever necessary,''
he added.

The unit was established during a $ 400-million overhaul of the hospital.

Graham Smith, a spokesman for AIDS Concern, said he was amazed that no one at
the hospital had contacted the group about the unit.

''The issue of specialised units for AIDS sufferers is a delicate one as there
is always the worry of creating a negative stigma. But if a unit is set up to
cope with increases it would be normal within the network of people who work
with HIV and AIDS to know something about it,'' said Mr Smith.

AIDS Foundation chief executive Frederick Tong Kin-sang said: ''We will make
inquiries to see what has happened here and find out why we have not been told.

''At one stage it was our policy to be set against specialised units but now
there are arguments on both sides and we will have to examine this further.''

Dr Chow said publicity was not given to the ward as the hospital wanted to avoid
any possible stigmatisation of AIDS patients.

DATELINE: HARTFORD, CONN.


Those attending an AIDS forum Saturday night expected to hear Arthur Ashe's own
account of his fight with AIDS, but instead the panel discussion became

the setting for the tennis champion's last public words.

"I'm sorry that I was unable to attend in person the Connecticut Forum on AIDS.
But I did want to make this tape to bring a few messages to you as you

are assembled to talk about this vital subject," Ashe said in the 15-minute

videotape.

Ashe planned to be part of a panel of nationally known AIDS experts and

activists at the Connecticut Forum on AIDS at the Bushnell. But he canceled

his appearance because of failing health.

"I have known of course that I have had AIDS since September 1988 and

lived a relatively free life with very few opportunistic infections until just
recently," Ashe said.

Ashe died Saturday at 3:13 p.m. of AIDS-related pneumonia at 49. The only black
man to win the Wimbledon championship and the U.S. Open, announced last April
that he contracted AIDS from an unscreened blood transfusion during his second
open heart surgery in 1983.

Ashe since became an activist and a national spokesman for AIDS awareness. He
formed the Arthur Ashe Foundation to raise money for AIDS-related projects and
to increase public education. He also joined the boards of the Harvard

AIDS Institute and the UCLA AIDS Institute.

"Arthur handled all of this with such grace and dignity," said Boca

Raton's Mary Fisher, a friend of Ashe and a forum panelist who founded the

Family AIDS Network, Inc. after she found out she was HIV-positive.

"He made a difference in my life and so many others by talking, by

educating and by loving," she said. "It's my hope that we all as a nation

listen to what Arthur said-- that we must fight AIDS.

"I am so sad," Fisher said, wiping away her tears before returning to

the forum.

Among the other panelists were Dr. Robert Gallo, who helped discover HIV, Larry
Kramer, playwright and AIDS activist, Jeanne White, whose son, Ryan,

captured national attention during his battle with AIDS.

Some members of the audience said they were stunned by the Ashe's death.

"It was perfectly quiet and you couldn't help but cry. A complete hush

fell over the audience," said Shirley Jefferson, a volunteer with AIDS

Project Hartford. In the video, "he talked about how he was too sick to be

here tonight. He said he was too weak."

"I am stunned," said Manuel Magaz, the executive director of Latinos

Against AIDS, a group that cares for those infected with AIDS and provides

preventive education. Magaz has the AIDS virus.

"I'm real surprised by the obvious shock I have seen here tonight. People who
never met him were crying," he said. "If we'd acted this way when the

first people died, perhaps we wouldn't have had the amount of deaths that we

do today.

"It's a shame that it takes the death of a famous person to get a

response from society," Magaz said. "Most people who have AIDS aren't famous

and they died unnoticed and unmourned."

But some people at the forum said that Ashe's contributions would go a

long way to advance AIDS education.

Mara Lejjer, 17, said she volunteered to work at the forum from the AIDS

club at the Watkinson School, a private school in West Hartford, to learn more
about AIDS from Ashe.

"I was looking forward to meeting him today," Lejjer said. "I wanted to

learn more about AIDS and how I could help the community. His death has an

impact because (young people) are able to relate to him and what he has

accomplished-- whatever we do in life.

"As awful as it is," Lejjer said, "his death raised the awareness 100

percent that AIDS kills."

Environment: Hungry for action, begging for change - Food aid can lead to
environmental devastation and human suffering. It can also work for good. As
Western leaders discuss aid to the Soviet republics, Simon Maxwell and Hans
Singer discuss the lessons both sides must learn from past mistakes

BYLINE: By SIMON MAXWELL and HANS SINGER

LENGTH: 1089 words


WITH Western leaders falling over themselves to propose food aid to Eastern
Europe and the republics of the former Soviet Union, the casual observer may be
surprised to learn that this is the most vilified form of overseas aid, indicted
by a coalition which ranges from academics and voluntary agencies to politicians
and development campaigners.

When it comes to developing countries, British policy is unequivocal: food aid
may be appropriate in extreme emergencies of the kind found in Ethiopia or
Sudan, but is otherwise a second best form of aid and should be discouraged. An
official evaluation of the Dutch food aid programme, published only a few weeks
ago, concludes in similar terms, referring to the 'minimal effectiveness and
efficiency of food aid as a development instrument'.


The case made against food aid is that it has more to do with disposing of
embarrassing surpluses than with development.

Critics argue that food aid often takes the form of commodities which are
unfamiliar to the recipients: wheat, for example, to people whose normal diet is
based on maize or sorghum. And they guess this can bias tastes to create a
dependence on foods that cannot easily be grown in recipient countries. Food aid
sold into the markets of these countries, often at cheap prices, benefits urban
consumers more than the rural poor.

It can also have the effect of depressing the prices that local producers
receive: the so-called disincentive effect. Furthermore, governments can find
themselves dependent on food aid and the budget revenue that sales provide.
Finally, the critics allege that recipients neglect agricultural policy and live
at the political mercy of a few large surplus producers.

The US provides around 55 per cent of the 10-12 million tons of grain supplied
as food aid each year, the European Community another 25 per cent and Canada
around 10 per cent.

Their critics make a serious case. But experience shows that the negative
effects of food aid can be avoided. If the new recipients seek models for the
successful use of food aid, they could usefully begin with Europe itself.

It is not often remembered that of Marshall Aid, which helpedEurope recover from
the effects of the second world war, more than 40 per cent or over Dollars 5
billion at 1948-51 prices, consisted of food, feed and fertilizer.

Far from causing a disincentive effect or long-term dependence, food aid to
Europe in the late 1940s contributed to the reconstruction of a dynamic
agricultural sector which is now (thanks largely, of course, to subsidies) a
substantial exporter. Not the least achievement of food aid under the Marshall
Plan was the contribution to government budgets made by selling food aid to
consumers. The European countries wrested control of the so-called 'counterpart
funds' from the US Government and thereby re-established fiscal and monetary
control over their own economies.

In later times, the story has been perhaps more patchy, but there have been
undoubted food aid successes. Greece, Turkey and Israel were early recipients
who graduated rapidly to self-reliance.

In the developing world, India and South Korea can make similar claims. Indeed,
it is sometimes argued that the Green Revolution in Indian agriculture was made
possible because American food aid under Public Law 480 provided new aid
resources.

The most familiar form of food aid is for emergency use in times of famine or
other natural disaster. But 80 per cent of food aid is used for development
purposes, either for sale to generate a counterpart fund or for direct
distribution to vulnerable groups. In these forms, it is always a difficult and
potentially dangerous development tool. But it is also one that can make an
important contribution to faster growth and greater food security.

What, then, can the new recipients learn from nearly half a century's experience
with large-scale food aid?

First, the new players need to remember that, even in the face of a winter
'famine', the rich will not go hungry. Only the poor starve: food aid needs
careful targeting to provide an effective safety-net. At the same time, there
should be no nonsense about delivering individual food parcels to needy
families. The best use of food aid is to sell it in the market and use the cash
thus raised to provide the poor with the means to acquire food with dignity and
self-respect, perhaps through public sector employment schemes or social
security benefits.

Secondly, food aid must not substitute for vigorous attention to domestic
agricultural production and marketing. It would be a tragedy if newly-privatised
farms across Eastern Europe were to find their markets undermined by massive
supplies of Western food aid.

The best defence against the disincentive effect is simultaneously to expand
demand through employment creation or welfare payments. But agricultural
investment and research and marketing are all important areas that governments
neglect at their peril. Food aid provides resources to build infrastructure and
establish new marketing channels in a liberalising economy.

Thirdly, food aid must not become a fiscal drug. In Bangladesh, selling food aid
has provided up to 40 per cent of the government budget and become
indispensable. The new recipients need to keep careful control over the
counterpart fund so as not to become aid dependent.

Donors can help, by guaranteeing to substitute financial help for food aid when
food is no longer needed, and by insisting that a good part of the counterpart
fund be spent on helping countries distribute their own food.

Finally, the experience of developing countries suggests that there are great
advantages to both sides in using multilateral channels for the delivery of food
aid. There are economies of scale in delivering commodities, it is easier to
match total food aid supplies to import needs and the risk of politically
motivated fluctuations in aid flows is reduced. It is also possible to buy food
in one aid-receiving country (Poland?) for supply to another (Russia?). Is there
a new role here for the UN's World Food Programme?

Food aid to Eastern Europe is already the fastest growing sector of food aid
worldwide and with the Soviet republics now entering the lists, the volumes are
bound to grow still faster. The new recipients will do well to learn from
others' past experience.

Studies, University of Sussex.

AIDS Tests: Do It Yourself?;
FDA's No-Home-Testing Policy is Endangering Everyone

BYLINE: Elliott J. Millenson

SECTION: OUTLOOK; PAGE C5; INSIGHT

LENGTH: 1055 words


IN AN ARTICLE following the Third International Conference on AIDS held in June
1987, Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer observed that gay-rights
groups "have two principal demands on government: immediate cure and no
testing." Since then, AIDS activist group pressure on federal AIDS policies has
helped bring about significant results in developing treatments for AIDS, as
evidenced by recent announcements on AZT and progress on such promising drugs as
DDI. Yet, disturbingly, far more people may be harmed by activist group
opposition to testing than will be helped by their pressure on government to
accelerate research for an AIDS cure.

Voluntary testing for the presence of the HIV virus, the virus which causes
AIDS, is a vital way to help prevent the spread of the disease. According to the
U.S. Centers for Disease Control, more than a million Americans may be infected
with the HIV virus. Yet, the vast majority are unaware of their infection
because they look and feel healthy. That's because the median time between
infection and the onset of symptoms is 9.6 years, according to a recent
University of California at San Francisco study.

Testing is the only way during that long incubation period that someone can
determine HIV infection so that steps can be taken to avoid infecting others and
to seek life-prolonging treatment. In fact, a recent New England Journal of
Medicine article vigorously recommended HIV testing "to all U.S. adults under
the age of 60 regardless of their reported history."

Despite the benefits of AIDS testing, AIDS activist groups have strongly opposed
its use since reliable tests were first developed five years ago. While
activists raised many concerns -- from test reliability to the potential
emotional trauma of receiving a positive result -- the primary opposition has
centered on the fear of potential discrimination against those testing positive.
Additionally, many AIDS activists have taken the well-meaning position that
there is no benefit to infected people of knowing their infection status since
no cure for AIDS exists.

Many other Americans, however, see the benefits to AIDS testing and would like
to get tested. But they are reluctant to do so using current testing
alternatives. The main reasons for not wanting to visit a doctor or public
testing clinic are fear that results will not be kept confidential, and a
concern about lack of anonymity, according to several research studies. Even
doctors, fearful that results will not be kept confidential, sometimes
recommended that their patients not get tested for AIDS. One research study
showed that a third of those who wanted to be tested for AIDS would be willing
to be tested by using a home AIDS test.

A test for AIDS which can be taken in the privacy of the home can dramatically
increase access to AIDS testing by providing a readily-available, confidential
testing alternative. In 1987, University Hospital Laboratories Corp. (UHL)
became the first company to successfully develop a reliable home AIDS test.
UHL's product differed from traditional home-tests, such as those for pregnancy,
which test specimens entirely in the home. Instead, to ensure laboratory-test
quality, people would use the test kit to collect a blood specimen onto special
paper containing a unique code number, and then send that sample via a prepaid
overnight mailer to UHL's laboratory. Specimens would be tested using a method
identical to that used by doctors and hosptials -- the ELISA screening and
Western Blot confirmation. Results, counseling and follow-up referrals would be
provided over the telephone by UHL staff trained in AIDS counseling, crisis
interventon and telephone counseling. After conducting clinical trials, UHL
submitted a premarket approval application to the FDA in December 1987. The data
demonstrated that a representative sample of people could follow test
instructions and safely obtain a specimen providing results identical to
specimens obtained in a doctor's office or hospital. In March 1988, the FDA
responded to that submission by announcing that it simply would not accept any
home AIDS test applications. As justification for this unprecedented policy of
refusing even to study the evidence, the FDA cited concerns raised by "advisory
groups and interested parties." Translation: Since AIDS activists oppose home
AIDS testing, we won't allow the test on the market even if it works. Don't
confuse us with the facts.

The number of AIDS cases in the United States has doubled since 1987. Yet the
FDA continues to adhere to a policy, based on the misguided, parochial views of
a powerful special interest, which adversely affects all Americans. Rather than
encourage testing, the federal government continues to encourage the mistaken
belief that there is such a thing as "safe sex." For instance, although condoms
can help prevent the spread of AIDS, using condoms when one partner is infected
can pose the same risk as Russian roulette -- a study reported on in the New
England Journal of Medicine showed a 17-percent incidence of infection when
condoms were used and one partner was infected. It is interesting that even the
Public Health Service recommends "alternative forms of sex," not "safe sex,"
when one partner is infected.

The number of Americans who have died from AIDS has now surpassed those killed
in Vietnam. And for every one who has died of AIDS, several dozen more are
infected with the HIV virus and don't know it. Without a readily available AIDS
testing alternative, such as a home AIDS test, many more thousands of people
will die needlessly. Several weeks ago, the Gay Men's Health Crisis, a
high-profile AIDS activist group, endorsed testing for the AIDS virus. Their
change in position was based on just-published reports which concluded that AZT
can postpone the onset of AIDS. It is not yet clear whether AIDS activists are
ready to change their stance on home AIDS testing.

In any event, the time is long overdue for the government to move beyond
politics and establish sensible AIDS policies which protect all Americans. Like
the search for a cure, home AIDS testing needs to be expedited, not delayed.

and chairman of University Hospital Laboratories Corp.

Media: Reports that foster ignorance about Aids: Angus Finney on how the British
press fails its readers in an area where accuracy, not sensationalism, is needed

BYLINE: ANGUS FINNEY

LENGTH: 1017 words


ON Sunday, 28 May this year, the News of the World ran a story headlined: 'The
house that died of shame'. Subtitled 'Star Aids mansion is destroyed', the
'exclusive' read: 'The spectre of Aids-ravaged film legend Rock Hudson is
finally being exorcised from the mansion he once used as a gay pleasure palace.'

Public health educators dread this kind of tabloid newspaper story, which
included references to 'workmen wearing protective clothing', and demolition
crews being 'careful not to cut themselves'.


They argue that stories like this foster the myths, confusion and misinformation
surrounding Aids in the public mind.

Margaret Jay, the director of the National Aids Trust, the UK's largest Aids
charity, stresses the importance of distinguishing between the quality
newspapers, which have an interest in reporting Aids responsibly, and the others
who do not. 'Our tabloid press has its own peculiar agenda, and as a result, its
own way of reporting Aids.'

Officially endorsed homophobia is a major problem. For example, a Daily Star
editorial has called for 'leper-like colonies' because 'the human race is under
threat from promiscuous homosexuals', who 'are by far the biggest spawning
grounds for Aids' (2 December 1988).

Dr Vernon Coleman's column in The Sun is still 'banging away at his anti-gay
drum,' says one health official, despite evidence that shows Aids steadily
moving into the heterosexual population, she says.

When the Health Education Authority launched its heterosexual anti-Aids campaign
in the spring of 1988, the Daily Express, Daily Mail, The Sun and Sunday
Telegraph all attacked the effort as misguided.

'Spreading the false message of Aids,' wrote the Express, which asked who the
HEA was 'trying to kid'? The Mail wrote that a campaign directed at
heterosexuals was 'a lie, a waste of funds and energy and a cruel diversion'.

Health educators are concerned that Aids is now perceived by the Press to have
long passed its 'flavour of the month' period. News editors are consequently not
giving the story the consideration the health educators feel it deserves.

One problem is that traditionally, news journalism by definition requires new
information to report. The difficulty is that Aids is incompatible with this
formula because it presents a long-running, subtly changing story, rather than a
front-page headline every day.

Inconsistent coverage is further undermined by mistakes and misinformation in
stories and headlines. The Equality Council of the National Union of Journalists
has recently updated its original 1984 guidelines for the reporting of Aids. It
stresses the importance of correct terminology when reporters and sub-editors
write about Aids.

The most common mistake is the failure to distinguish between the Human
Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Aids.

Aids is not a disease as such, but a collection of numerous medical conditions,
which tend to emerge as the result of damage to the body's immunological
defences caused by HIV.

Mistakes often stem from journalism's desired economy of words. 'Journalists
say: 'I've got to write 'Aids test', because it's too long to write 'HIV
antibody test',' says Lynne Walsh, the senior press officer at the HEA.

Other common faults include the ' 'high-risk group' way of looking at Aids,
which implies that if you're a gay man, you're inevitably at risk, and if you're
not, you'll be OK. The really important thing is to look at people's behaviour,'
she explains.

References to the 'Aids virus', 'Aids carriers' and 'Aids victim' also remain a
barrier to public understanding, says Simon Watney, who co-edited the recently
published Taking Liberties - AIDS and Cultural Politics. This reporting also
encourages the mistaken belief that there is an 'Aids test' - 'as if a single
blood test could possibly be sensitive to, or predict the possible onset of all
the various conditions characterised by Aids, as well as the presence or absence
of HIV'.

Problems with Aids and language are not limited to the tabloids. Irregular
coverage in some of the quality press has also confused people, says Nick
Partridge, spokesman for the Terrence Higgins Trust, the UK's largest self- help
Aids charity. He says that sub-editors often write misleading or irresponsible
headlines for otherwise accurate reports. For example, The Independent recently
ran a news brief headlined: 'Aids victims' (11 July 1989, p2), when reporting
the Government's latest total of people with HIV.

'The Observer has sensible stuff, and then runs the Richard Ingrams column - the
most homophobic in the UK. The Times has an excellent science column, but
leaders and other columns have been appallingly inaccurate,' says Mr Partridge.

One possible solution is that adopted in the United States, where journalists
are now being placed on specialist 'Aids beats' on major metropolitan
newspapers.

Margaret Jay points to the depth and level of consistency found in the American
press's reporting on Aids as an example to the UK press. 'It's not good enough
to say that's just because Aids in the States is further developed (in numbers
of deaths) than here. We should be studying and learning from their advances.'

Carefully co-ordinated campaigns in the Netherlands, Switzerland and throughout
Scandinavia are examples of how Aids can be handled by the Press as a
containable epidemic, says Mr Partridge. Through professional attention to the
latest medical information, use of language and the avoidance of stereotyped
labels, journalists have contributed to their country's Aids education
campaigns, rather than undermined them.

Margaret Jay believes the fact that the British press was 'terribly
under-represented' at the recent Montreal Conference on Aids is indicative of
the overall problem.

'What we're seeing is a peculiarly British phenomenon - a collective denial
syndrome. Aids is a really difficult subject that addresses many taboos. That
makes it even more important that national editors are brought together and
forced to confront it.'

Metro hospice planned for AIDS patients

BYLINE: By Lillian Newbery Toronto Star

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A2

LENGTH: 579 words


   A Toronto group is planning to set up a hospice for patients with AIDS, says
the chairman of the AIDS Committee of Toronto.

Professor Tom Alloway told a forum on AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome)
at the Ontario Science Centre yesterday that a move to get a hospice - a
residence for the terminally ill - has just got under way.

In an interview later, Alloway said he couldn't give details about the proposal
but a private group is planning the project. The AIDS Committee of Toronto,
which provides support services for AIDS patients, their companions and
families, has been asked to send members to a proposed board for the hospice.

Alloway, a professor of psychology at the University of Toronto's Erindale
campus in Mississauga, said a hospice is needed because "a lot of AIDS patients
really have nowhere to go, except to stay in hospital," even when they don't
need to be in hospital.

"Many don't have anyone to help care for them."

Little support

Earlier, he told the forum that homosexual men, who account for 90 per cent of
AIDS patients in Ontario, often have "rather strained relations with their
families." When they are sick with AIDS, they are unable to count on support
from their families.

Dr. Norbert Gilmore of Montreal, chairman of the National Advisory Committee on
AIDS, said later the hospice idea is "great" but is not the single answer to
caring for AIDS patients, whose treatment needs include home care facilities and
many health care resources.

The forum was held to answer the public's questions about AIDS. There are 309
cases of AIDS in Canada, including 18 children; and 153 people have died of the
disease, which destroys the body's ability to fight infections. In Ontario there
have been 128 AIDS cases, of whom 52 have died.

The panel told the audience of about 120 that the virus is not passed on toilet
seats, in hot tubs, swimming pools or lakes and is not transmitted by normal
household or social contact.

Mosquito bites

One man in the audience wanted to know whether AIDS could be transmitted in a
mosquito bite.

Dr. John Clayton, head of the Laboratory Centre for Disease Control in Ottawa,
said mosquitoes don't tend to carry viruses in North America. Gilmore said
experience in Africa suggests that the virus is not borne by mosquitoes. If so,
there would be a "widespread pandemic" among the people there. The virus is
usually spread by sexual contact.

Another man asked whether rescue workers such as ambulance attendants,
firefighters and police officers should be concerned about being "splattered
with blood" as part of their jobs.

Clayton said in general a person who acquires AIDS has had "a lot of contacts"
with people with the virus.

Long incubation

Gilmore said studies of health care workers who have actually stuck themselves
with a needle when treating AIDS patients show that none has developed AIDS,
AIDS-related illness or even the antibody to the virus.

But Dr. John Derrick, chairman of the AIDs project for the Canadian Red Cross,
said that, because the virus has a long incubation period, rescue workers should
do resuscitation using cautious methods being taught and wash their hands or
body parts that have been splattered with blood, no matter whose blood it is.

He said the next strategy at the federal level is to involve and co-ordinate
groups such as AIDs committeees, public health organizations and others in an
effort to educate the public.

Legal Aid Cannot Sue on Contracts

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

SECTION: Section B;  Page 4;  Column 1;  Metropolitan Desk

LENGTH: 504 words


Saying that the statute of limitations had expired, a state judge yesterday
dismissed a lawsuit by the Legal Aid Society that had sought to block the
Giuliani administration from turning over nearly a tenth of its cases to new
legal organizations.

Justice David B. Saxe of New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan ruled that
the Legal Aid Society, which provides legal services to the poor, had missed its
deadline for filing the lawsuit by three months. Legal Aid officials found out
last November that the city would not permit them to bid on contracts to keep
the disputed cases, and the judge ruled that under the law they had four months
from that date to challenge the city in court.

The Legal Aid Society filed the suit last week, seeking to prevent the city from
going ahead with contracts with three new nonprofit legal organizations to
represent poor defendants. The new groups, which are run by lawyers who used to
work for Legal Aid, are to receive slightly less than a tenth of the more than
200,000 cases handled each year by Legal Aid.

Legal Aid officials had contended that the Giuliani administration was
reassigning a portion of its caseload as retribution for a four-day strike by
Legal Aid lawyers in 1994. They argued, too, that the city had violated its own
rules by refusing to allow the Legal Aid Society to compete for the contracts.

City officials said, however, that the contracts were intended to create an
alternative to Legal Aid, in part so that other lawyers would be available in
the event of another strike. And Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani accused Legal Aid of
filing the suit to preserve what he called its "monopoly" on legal services for
the poor.

Justice Saxe, while throwing out the suit on the technical grounds, said that he
would have ruled in the city's favor on the lawsuit's substantive issues as
well.

"This is a complete vindication of the city's position that the Legal Aid
Society wants a monopoly over indigent criminal defense services," Colleen A.
Roche, press secretary to Mr. Giuliani, said.

Lawyers representing Legal Aid had argued that the city violated state laws by
failing to get the City Council to approve changes in the city's existing system
for defending the poor. They also said the city broke its own bidding rules when
it failed to hold a formal hearing before declaring Legal Aid ineligible to
compete for new contracts.

But the judge said that the Mayor had the authority to apportion some of Legal
Aid's cases to other nonprofit legal agencies and that the city had the right to
exclude Legal Aid from the bidding for contracts designed specifically to create
alternatives to Legal Aid.

"The city has reached the conclusion that multiple awards were indeed necessary
for continued adequate service, as well as to forward other objectives such as
encouraging the creation of small businesses, and this court sees no basis to
find otherwise," Justice Saxe wrote in a six-page decision.

Legal Aid officials said they would appeal.

Sexual tolerance helps prevent AIDS

BYLINE: BY SARA HENLEY REUTERS NEWS AGENCY

SECTION: LIFE; Pg. D1

LENGTH: 603 words

DATELINE: AMSTERDAM


Sexual tolerance may be helping the Netherlands curb the spread of AIDS,
researchers say.

The easy-going approach to people whose lifestyles expose them to greatest risk
of AIDS infection - homosexuals, drug-takers and habitues of Amsterdam's Red
Light district - might suggest the Dutch have an especially serious problem with
the disease.

"Not so," said Frans van den Boom, joint co-ordinator of a recent official
survey of AIDS in the Netherlands. "In fact, the reverse may be true."

Scientists say the Dutch approach has actually helped curb the spread of AIDS,
which the World Health Organization expects will infect 40 million people
worldwide by 2000.

In the decade since the first Dutch AIDS case, the country has reported fewer
AIDS victims per million people than Spain, Switzerland, France, Italy and
Denmark.

"We are quite simply convinced of the importance of a liberal, tolerant policy
in AIDS and drug use," said Wouter de Jong, a researcher at the National
Committee on Aids Control.

Posters remind the Dutch public that "a little understanding never gave anyone
AIDS."

Hard drugs are illegal, but a 10-year plan to provide clean needles to addicts
has cut the spread of AIDS among drug users. While about a third of European and
nearly a quarter of American AIDS patients were infected by dirty needles, fewer
than one in 10 Dutch AIDS victims caught the disease this way.

The Dutch are building on a long tradition of consensus.

"There is unique co-operation here," said Wiebe van der Woude also from the Aids
Control committee.

"Since the epidemic began everyone has been sitting down together - doctors,
homosexuals, drug users and prostitutes."

AIDS has spread more slowly in the Netherlands than expected. In 1987, experts
predicted 3,500 cases by 1991. In fact there have been just over 2,000 to date,
though the worst of AIDS will emerge only in the next decade.

Prevention policy among homosexual or bisexual men - who make up nearly 80 per
cent of Dutch AIDS victims - has focused on helping them inform one another
about safe sex.

The Netherlands' reputation for tolerance has attracted many homosexuals. Once
here, they find an advanced and powerful network which also serves as a channel
for unembarrassed, professional information on AIDS prevention.

"There's still a whole taboo around AIDS, to do with guilt and sex," said Rob de
Waal of the HIV-Vereniging, a Dutch support group for people infected with the
AIDS virus.

The more a person is ashamed of their sexuality, the greater their risk of
exposure to AIDS by not using a condom for sex, Dutch researchers recently
concluded.

This applied not only to gay men but also to prostitutes and their clients.

A survey of condom use among Dutch prostitutes - prostitution has been legal in
the Netherlands for years - showed 81 per cent of them and 75 per cent of their
clients use condoms routinely.

But Dutch scientists are far from optimistic about the future.

Although AIDS has spread more slowly than expected, between 8,000 and 12,000
people - nearly one per cent of the population - are thought to be infected with
the HIV virus which leads to AIDS.

Total AIDS cases are expected to quadruple by 2000.

There are signs that some people, especially the young, are becoming complacent.

"We have an absolute problem with teenagers," said Van der Woude. "They know the
risk, but only half ever use condoms."

About 12 per cent of Dutch adults still shun safe sex.

"It's amazing how people seem to believe they can just forget a disease as
terrible as this," Van der Woude said.

FEAR SLOWS AIDS FIGHT IN SUBURBS

AIDS, until recently seen mainly as a disease of the cities, has become a
serious and growing problem in the communities surrounding New York, according
to health officials.

The growth in the number of people with AIDS in the suburban communities is
straining already thin resources. the officials said. And suburban residents'
fear and denial that the disease is spreading in their communities has slowed
development of the kind of resources to help AIDS victims that have long been in
place in cities, they added.

But one of the most disturbing aspects of the situation, the officials said, is
that the number of suburban people with AIDS is widely believed to be much
greater than officially reported.

AIDS Victims Returning to Suburbs

This is so, they said, because increasing numbers of people contract the disease
in urban areas and, unable to support themselves, return home to their families
in the suburbs. Those people are in addition to the growing number of AIDS cases
contracted in the suburbs.

Some officials said the disparity between actual and reported cases was allowing
suburban communities to continue to deny that AIDS was a problem for them,
thereby slowing the delivery of care and education.

''People in the suburbs don't want to be touched by things like homosexuality,
like substance abuse,'' said the executive director of the Mid-Hudson Valley
AIDS Task Force in White Plains, John E. Egan. ''And people protect themselves
from things that are threatening them by denying that they exist. People are
afraid of this. They don't want AIDS in the community. But unfortunately, they
don't have a choice.''

Statistics from several suburban counties in New York, New Jersey and
Connecticut show a substantial increase since the early 1980's in the number of
people diagnosed as Bergen County in New Jersey, for example, the total number
of AIDS cases has risen from 7 in June 1983 to the current figure of 100. In
Fairfield County in Connecticut, 96 cases have been reported since 1980. #308
Cases Reported on L.I.

Long Island, with 308 reported cases, is the nonurban area with the largest
group of people with AIDS in the country.

The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation of Princeton, N.J., which recently pledged
more than $17.2 million for AIDS care and education, has recognized the need for
increased care for AIDS patients in the suburbs, said the director of the
Foundation's AIDS Health Services Program, Dr. Mervyn F. Silverman.

The foundation awarded a $1.6 million grant to a consortium of Long Island
groups - the only suburban group to share in the program - to improve the
delivery of AIDS services and to foster the development of a ''national suburban
model'' for AIDS care. The foundation also awared money to New York City and
made a joint award for Newark and Jersey City.

''Suburbia is unique because it is unsuspecting,'' Dr. Silverman said.

'We Have to Teach People'

''We have to get people to understand that it could happen to them,'' said Gail
Barouh, executive director of the Long Island Association for AIDS Care, which
is based in Huntington. ''We have to teach people that it is a problem that can
affect everybody.''

Though the majority of AIDS patients around the country continue to be
homosexual or bisexual men and intravenous drug users, health officials warn
that the disease is beginning to affect other groups, including heterosexual
women. In the United States, AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is
believed spread primarily through anal intercourse and through shared needles by
drug users.

Health care professionals and sociologists said the intensity of the AIDS
problem was recognized in the cities long ago. But they said such recognition
has been lacking in the suburbs, largely because most people are unaware of how
many people with AIDS actually live in their communities.

In the mid-Hudson area, including Westchester, Rockland, Orange, Putnam, Ulster,
Dutchess and Sullivan Counties, more than 150 AIDS cases have been reported
since 1981, said Mr. Egan. ''But the actual number of cases in the area is at
least twice that much,'' he said. ''Perhaps it's even 10 times as many.''

In addition to the disparity in numbers, ''there is a great reluctance to
believe the scientific information,'' said a professor of science, technology
and society at Cornell University, Dr. Dorothy Nelkin, who is a member of a
Federal panel of that studied AIDS. ''People are afraid, they are less familiar
with the problem.''

Even when forced to deal with the problem, families in the suburbs are often
overwhelmed with fear that their neighbors, co-workers or even other family
members will learn of their situation. This differs from many cities, where
tightly knit homosexual communities often support and care for people with AIDS,
their partners and families.

Ms. Barouh of the Long Island association recounted a recent experience she had
in a bereavement group with six families whose children had died of AIDS. The
group - which she called a good representation of the AIDS cases the
organization must handle - included the parents of a woman who contracted the
disease through heterosexual sexual relations, two parents of male homosexuals,
one brother of a homosexual, and parents of male and female drug abusers.

''They all turned to me and said they were unhappy with how AIDS is being
treated in the suburbs,'' Ms. Barouh said. Her response was harsh.

Group Faced With AIDS Issues

''Only two of you count in Long Island statistics, the rest of your chidren came
from the city or California,'' she recalled saying. ''And none of you will admit
publicly that one of your loved ones even died from AIDS.''

''Why should it be any different until you stand up,'' she continued. ''Each one
of them just looked at me and said, 'I'm really scared.' ''

Dealing with that fear can make providing AIDS care extremely difficult. ''It
leads to difficulty in getting widespread community support for AIDS programs,''
Mr. Egan said. ''There are no medical or social services, no housing. It's been
very difficult to provide services to our clients. It's been an uphill battle.''

In New Jersey, where more than half the AIDS cases have been attributed to
intravenous drug use, primarily in urban areas, the state ''has really been very
derelict in providing services for AIDS,'' said Margaret E. Nichols, the
executive director of the Hyacinth Foundation, a group that recently received a
contract from the New Jersey Department of Health to provide services to people
with AIDS.

Intravenous Drug Users

New Jersey is the only state in the country where more than half of its AIDS
patients are intravenous drug users, But recently the state has experienced a
growing problem in its suburbs, particularly in the northern counties of Bergen
and Essex. In those areas, ''70 to 80 percent of the cases involve gay men,''
Dr. Nichols said. ''In that way, the demographics are much more like the rest of
the country.''

Richard J. Russo, an assistant commissioner in the State Department of Health,
agreed that more AIDS services were needed throughout New Jersey, but he said
the state was beginning to succeed in ''setting up a continuum of care for AIDS
patients.''

''But we have a unique situation in developing community-based care,'' he said.
''IV drug users do not have a community buddy system, they are more street
people.''

Dr. Nichols is blunt in assessing New Jersey's record with AIDS patients,
especially those in the suburbs. ''If you have AIDS,'' she said, ''you are
better off if you don't live in New Jersey.''

But New Jersey is certainly not alone in having problems working with AIDS
patients in the suburbs, where community-based care is much more difficult to
develop than in the cities.

Such community-based care plays the major role in the ''national suburban
model'' envisioned by the Long Island Association for AIDS Care and the Robert
Wood Johnson Foundation.

The model - according to Ms. Barouh and Dr. Bruce D. Agins, director of the AIDS
program at the Nassau County Medical Center - would include the hiring of a
visiting physician and full-time housing, education and volunteer coordinators.

The volunteer program, which has been used effectively in New York City and San
Francisco, involves finding people to serve as buddies or companions for people
with AIDS, to work the AIDS hotlines or to handle support groups. The Long
Island association now has 85 volunteers, Ms. Barouh said, a substantially
increased and continually growing number.

Premier Li Keqiang inspected Beijing You'an Hospital and visited AIDS patients,
volunteers for AIDS prevention and medical staff on Nov 28, just before the 27th
World AIDS Day, which falls on Dec 1 every year.

The hospital is one of the earliest medical institutions offering services for
AIDS patients. It has made outstanding contributions to AIDS epidemiological
investigation, clinical treatment, drug development, medical training,
international cooperation and publicity.

When talking with AIDS patients, experts and representatives of international
organizations at You'an Hospital, the Premier said that the government should
shoulder the major responsibility of fighting AIDS. Li said that the
government's investment into fighting AIDS cannot be reduced.

He said the government must help anti-AIDS organizations cope with the fall in
funding after international organizations pulled back from providing special
funds for AIDS.

The Premier said AIDS patients and their families need more respect and care.
Societal attitudes toward AIDS patients reflects the level of a society's
civilization and progress. The old attitudes of fear surrounding the topic of
AIDS must be abandoned and AIDS patients need more care.

Aids takes its toll on industries;
zz R2.4bn paid out in insurance claims, while employers foot the premiums

SECTION: BUSINESS REPORT; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 628 words


The Mining, transport, heavy construction, agriculture and fishing industries
are bearing the brunt of Aids-related deaths, which triggered a total R2.4
billion in insurance claims this year. The costs pass directly through to the
employers in the premiums they pay for group life insurance benefits.

According to the Department of Health, 5.7 million people are infected with HIV
and about 1 million receive antiretroviral (ARV) drugs from the state.

But companies have not left the fight against the spread of HIV/Aids to the
government. They have initiatives to assist employees and their families in
dealing with the disease.

Internal wellness programmes include voluntary counselling and testing (VCT),
awareness campaigns and support structures. These include allowing workers to
take time off from work in order to recuperate without forfeiting their
salaries, even in cases where employees have exhausted their sick leave.

The chairman of the Actuarial Society task force on retirement reform, Colin
Dutkiewicz, said the amount could have reached R3 billion had it not been for
the country's current ARV rollout programme.

"This means there are now fewer death claims from insurance companies and fewer
people being absent from work."

The health industry's Aids-related death costs have reached 1.1 percent of
salary costs, while non-Aids deaths are 0.8 percent, totalling 1.9 percent for
the sector.

Retail and education's Aids-related death costs stand at 1.6 percent and non-
Aids deaths at 1 percent, reaching 2.6 percent in total.

Transport's Aids-related death costs were 2.4 percent and non-Aids deaths were
1.3 percent, totalling 3.7 percent.

Heavy construction's Aids-related death costs were 3.4 percent, while non-Aids
deaths were 2.5 percent, totalling 5.9 percent.

Mining's Aids-related death costs were 3.4 percent, while non-Aids deaths were
2.8 percent, totalling 6.2 percent.

Aids-related death costs in agriculture and fishing were 2.9 percent and non-
Aids deaths were 1.2 percent, totalling 4.1 percent.

Corporate efforts that have been effective include Standard Bank's wellness
programme introduced in 2001. Peter Philip, the bank's head of corporate health,
said the programme looked at a number of infectious diseases and trauma
counselling, but it also had a strong focus on HIV/Aids.

"It makes business sense because anything that affects our staff will impact
productivity."

Standard Bank estimates that for every year that a senior staff member remains
productive, it saves about R300 000 and this rises to R750 000 for middle
managers.

Anglo American's HIV/Aids response has focused on having everyone know their
HIV/Aids status. "Eighty percent of our southern African employees now
participate in VCT compared with less than 10 percent in 2002. Over 6 000
employees are enrolled in HIV disease management programmes," said Pranill
Ramchander, Anglo American's spokesman.

Fergus Marupen, the chief of human resources at Absa, said the bank had spent
R75 million on its wellness programme over the past three years. "Regular
employee engagement sessions are held where industry and medical experts are
invited to present to staff on HIV/Aids management," he said.

Medical aid companies have designed specific programmes to assist members,
especially those living with the disease.

Fedhealth has a managed health care programme in place for people living with
HIV. The scheme currently has 2 313 beneficiaries who are registered on Aid for
Aids programmes, 81 percent of whom are receiving ARVs.

Bonitas' Aid for Aids programme educates members about both the prevention and
management of the disease.

Discovery Health conducts HIV/Aids education and prevention campaigns including
annual VCT. It also offers HIV/Aids management programmes to all its schemes.

ABSTRACT

By taking on the red tape of financial aid, the Connecticut Community Colleges
system hopes to help its campuses spend more time on counseling.

FULL TEXT

Financial aid can go a long way toward meeting the cost of attending community
colleges, but it is notoriously difficult to get students to apply. The
Connecticut Community Colleges system has hit on a process that helps.

About a decade ago, the system created a centralized student-aid office to cut
down on bureaucratic tasks at its 12 campuses and free up their staffs to work
more with students. Since that change in the 2000-1 academic year, the system
has seen the number of students applying for aid more than double, at a time
when enrollment has grown about 25 percent. And at least one other state system
is considering the model.

Marc S. Herzog, the Connecticut system's chancellor, saw an opportunity to
create the central aid office when the system moved its data onto SunGard Higher
Education's Banner software. At the time, each college's financial-aid staff was
responsible not only for packaging and distributing student aid, but also for
keeping up with regulations and policy changes, verifying student financial
information, and handling audits. A typical office at one of the system's
colleges had a financial-aid director, two other aid professionals, and
work-study employees. And in an increasingly technology-dependent field, some of
them were still pushing paper. "You are asking these offices to do an incredible
amount of work," Mr. Herzog says.

So Mr. Herzog, himself a former student-aid director, created a bureau in the
system office that took many of those routine tasks out of the individual aid
offices. He could do that because the system decided to run the software
centrally, rather than on each campus. The decision saved the system in
licensing fees, but more importantly, prevented it from having to hire 12
associate directors in charge of technology on the campuses, says Tom Bradham,
director of financial-aid services for the system.

The bureau, staffed by three student-aid and two information-technology workers,
provides support to the colleges' aid offices. Mr. Herzog estimates that the
staff members' salaries run about half-a-million dollars a year. If the system
hadn't created a central aid office, Mr. Herzog says, it would have had to add,
conservatively, two or three staff members per campus to handle student aid
under the new data system. He estimates that those salaries would have cost
about $2.4-million a year.

The service bureau handles all the upgrades and technical issues for the
student-aid aspects of the data system. It ensures compliance with federal and
state regulations and handles government audits. The bureau automatically
uploads student-aid applications into the software each night and sends the aid
offices the files they need in the morning. And its staff provides an
easy-to-reach resource for policy and technical questions.

The new data system allowed the colleges to automate some routine tasks, says
David J. Welsh, director of financial-aid services at Tunxis Community College.
This, he says, "leaves us more time to deal with real problems" like helping
students understand and take advantage of financial aid.

At a community college, many students are "a bit overwhelmed by the whole
college process," Mr. Welsh says. In many cases, his staff meets with students
in person to help them apply for aid. All of the college's entrance counseling
is done in person. And the staff also does outreach at area high schools. These
tasks are important but time-consuming, and making other parts of the job more
efficient has freed up more time for them.

The increase in staff time devoted to counseling, Mr. Welsh says, is one reason
the system has seen so many more students applying for aid. Since 2000-1, the
system has had a 111-percent increase in the number of students applying for
aid, and a 102-percent increase in students receiving it. In the 2008-9 academic
year, 63 percent of the system's students applied for aid. By comparison, 42.5
percent of all community-college students applied for aid in 2007-8, according
to an analysis by the Institute for College Access & Success of the most recent
data available from the National Postsecondary Student Aid Survey.

Before 2000, "we were very bad in getting students financial aid," says Mr.
Bradham. He was the financial-aid director at one of the system's campuses,
Asnuntuck Community College, from 1977 to 1998, until Mr. Herzog brought him in
to lead the software implementation and then run the service bureau. Back when
he was a financial-aid director, Mr. Bradham says, staff members in some of the
colleges' financial-aid offices still had to type a student's name and Social
Security number on a piece of paper and walk it to another office. And the
workload was tremendous: "At my office, I was director of cooperative education,
career services, and financial aid all at the same time."

The service bureau exists to support student-aid directors, he says. "We've
taken the mundane financial-aid tasks away from them," he says, but "what we
haven't taken away is the judgment. From the system, we have not given $1 of
financial aid to any student." That key task is still done at the campus level.

But the system's board did set some guidelines for packaging aid, changes that
coincided with the creation of the service bureau.

The first priority is covering all students' direct costs: tuition and fees,
books and supplies. Those costs now total $4,200, and the board's policy is to
cover any need a student has up to that amount in grants.

The colleges are also instructed to treat everyone as a full-time student.
Generally, more aid is available to students who attend full time, and the
college wants to make clear the maximum amount each student qualifies for. Doing
so, they think, encourages more students to attend full time -which makes
students more likely to stay in college, make good grades, and complete a
degree. Students are also given an explanation of full-time status. And the
colleges don't list loans as part of a student's award, although they do award
federally backed loans.

A Possible Model

For Connecticut, the new infrastructure has proved beneficial. "There's no way
we could handle our volume today if we didn't do what we did with our system
office," Mr. Bradham says.

And the service bureau has at least one fan outside of the state. "It's a very
impressive system in a number of ways," says Glenn DuBois, chancellor of
Virginia's community-college system, who went to Connecticut last summer to see
how the colleges' center operates firsthand. "I would say it's liberated them,
really, to do the counseling piece and the recruitment piece."

Mr. DuBois plans to do something similar in his own system. He just finished a
big software project for the system's finances, is currently working on human
resources, and will deal next with financial aid. Virginia uses PeopleSoft much
the way Connecticut uses Banner, so the system should be able to design a
similar center.

Community colleges operate differently in various states, but Mr. Herzog thinks
even those without a state system should find ways to work together to
centralize some of their student-aid functions. In addition to all its other
benefits, it should save some money. And who isn't looking to do that these
days?

Aid for AIDS

BYLINE: By DR MUIRIS HOUSTON

SECTION: CITY EDITION; HEALTH; MEDICAL MATTERS; Pg. 13

LENGTH: 884 words


Yesterday was World AIDS Day and the latest figures show that 60 million people
throughout the world have been infected with HIV since 1980. Some 20 million
have died from AIDS - 18 million of whom lived in Africa. Despite these grim
statistics, it is sobering to realise that we are still in the early stages of a
global AIDS epidemic.

The full name for AIDS is Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome. It is an incurable
but preventable disease carried by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). AIDS
is the late stage of HIV infection; as the immune system becomes overwhelmed,
the body loses its ability to fight off opportunistic infections. Untreated,
AIDS develops five to 10 years after infection with HIV. AIDS is not curable,
but by taking the latest antiviral drugs it can become a chronic rather than a
fatal condition.

Statistics just released by the National Disease Surveillance Centre (NDSC) have
confirmed 157 new cases of HIV infection here in the first six months of 2002.
Two people in the State have died from AIDS during the same period. Further
analysis of these figures found that 73 per cent of heterosexuals diagnosed with
HIV infection here were born in sub-Saharan Africa. In a statement emphasising
how widespread the disease is in developing countries, the NDSC said: "It is
important to remember that people from sub-Saharan Africa . . . include
students, immigrant workers, refugees, economic immigrants and asylum seekers."

No matter what aspect of AIDS/HIV you consider, the developed versus developing
countries axis comes sharply into focus. The West has transformed AIDS into a
chronic disease through intense research into novel treatments. The cost of
these drugs is not an issue, nor are the extensive facilities and health care
teams required to look after AIDS patients and their families. Prevention and
health education are well funded.

The most recent edition of AIDS, the official journal of the International AIDS
Society, shows just how much HIV prevention efforts have curbed the US AIDS
epidemic. Researchers from the Centre for AIDS Research at Emory University
posed two fundamental questions. Roughly how many lives have been saved because
of investment in prevention and have these HIV prevention efforts resulted in
cost savings? Using complex statistical modelling, Dr David Holtgrave and his
team came up with a number of routes the AIDS epidemic might have taken had
there been no prevention efforts.

Their findings are quite explicit: between 204,000 and 1,585,000 HIV infections
have been averted over a 20-year period, saving the US health system between $
56,000 and $ 195,000 per infection.

The fact that the US can afford the cost of this type of analytical research
emphasises the huge gulf between it and those states in Africa hit by the AIDS
epidemic. We in the West can afford the luxury of adopting a consensual and
human rights approach to HIV infection. Africa is still crying out for an
effective public health response to a problem that threatens the very existence
of sub-Saharan states. Teachers are dying at a faster rate than they can be
trained, industrial efficiency is declining and family incomes have been
severely hit. The UN estimates that six out of every 10 adolescents will be
infected with HIV in countries such as Zambia and South Africa. 12 million
children in Africa have been orphaned by AIDS.

But some good news is beginning to filter though. The prevalence of AIDS in
Uganda has dropped from 14 per cent of the population in the 1990s to just over
6 per cent this year following early and sustained action against HIV. According
to Dr Vincent O'Neill, lead adviser at Ireland Aid at the Department of Foreign
Affairs, the price of a course of AIDS treatment has dropped from US$ 18,000 to
US$ 600 in developing countries. This follows world trade negotiations and other
initiatives aimed at making pharmaceutical products more readily available in
poorer states. And in fairness to a Government under criticism for its "slash
and burn" approach to public spending, the Taoiseach yesterday reiterated a
commitment to allocate E30 million to help fight AIDS in poorer nations. As part
of World AIDS Day, he launched a booklet outlining the Government response to
HIV/AIDS in the developing world. This money helps support AIDS vaccine research
and covers contributions to a new global fund for AIDS, TB and malaria.

The international community has finally woken up to AIDS, with a five-fold
increase in funding for HIV projects compared with three years ago. But just as
progress is being made in Africa, there is growing concern that AIDS is
spreading rapidly in China, Russia and Eastern Europe. In the case of Russia the
spread is fuelled by a growth of HIV in the prison population and the collapse
of the health system since the break-up of the USSR.

Finally, I cannot write about HIV/AIDS without paying tribute to my friend and
colleague, Dr Fiona Bradley, who died last Monday. One of the Republic's best
medical educators and foremost primary care researchers, she gained an
international reputation in the study of HIV among prisoners. She will be sorely
missed.

phone recently, he could not have imagined that the call would touch off the
world's latest - and perhaps most bizarre - AIDS controversy.

''A voice came on the line and said it was Thabo Mbeki," Rasnick says, naming
South Africa's president. ''I didn't believe it at first. I didn't know
presidents just called out of the blue like that."

Apparently, when it comes to AIDS, Mbeki does. And for 15 minutes, the African
leader quizzed Rasnick about his work at the University of California at
Berkeley.

''He was checking me out, seeing if I was legitimate," Rasnick says. ''I suppose
I passed his test, because he asked me for my personal support of his anti-AIDS
efforts and I gave it to him."

Trouble is, more than 99 per cent of the world's other AIDS experts would have
flunked Rasnick. He is one of a tiny group of so-called ''dissident" researchers
who argue that AIDS simply does not exist.

The deadly disease is not linked to the virus known as HIV, Rasnick says. It's
merely a collection of more mundane illnesses associated with recreational drug
use and malnutrition.

And to believe otherwise, he insists, is to be duped by a vast conspiracy
involving governments, international drug companies and mainstream scientists
who are milking billions of dollars from the ''AIDS industry."

News of Mbeki's quiet consultations sparked an uproar in South Africa and has
many scientists there and abroad weighing whether they should stay away from the
2000 International AIDS Conference, scheduled for July in South Africa.

They fear that if AIDS dissidents are included in the assemblage, their views
will be given undue credibility and world attention.

Activists have attacked Mbeki's administration for flirting with pseudo- science
instead of facing the ruinous AIDS crisis in South Africa, where some 4 million
people - nearly 10 per cent of the population - are infected with HIV.

The scandal has plunged the nation's already troubled AIDS policy into further
confusion. And bewildered scientists throughout the world are scratching their
heads over why South Africa would choose to breathe new life into a discredited
hypothesis that they fear will only hamper global efforts to combat the dread
disease.

''All President Mbeki is saying is let's listen to everybody," said government
spokesman Parks Mankahlana after Mbeki ordered a blue-ribbon panel be organized
to re-evaluate the evidence of a global AIDS epidemic.

''Let's not silence one group or another with hysterical declarations. To find a
solution to this thing, we have to look at all angles."

Peter Duesberg, a Berkeley colleague of Rasnick and one of the U.S. leaders of
the AIDS-skeptics' camp, has been invited to attend the panel.

So far, health organizations such as UNAIDS and the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention have shunned direct comment on South Africa's wooing of
AIDS doubters.

But both agencies have released stinging statements denouncing the AIDS-
dissidents' position and labelling it a myth.

''I consider those guys real evil characters," said an angry World Health
Organization official in Geneva. ''By denying the link between HIV and AIDS,
they're undoing 20 years of public-health efforts. Why would anyone want to give
them this credibility?"

Actually, neither Mbeki's apparent fascination with the more arcane scientific
debates surrounding AIDS nor the views of AIDS skeptics such as Rasnick and
Duesberg are anything new.

In 1997, when he was still deputy president, Mbeki touted an alleged South
African cure for AIDS called Virodene. The drug has quietly faded from the
public scene.

And last year, after succeeding Nelson Mandela in the nation's second democratic
elections, Mbeki again became embroiled in controversy when he publicly
questioned the safety of AZT, an anti-retroviral drug widely used in the
developed world to block the transmission of HIV from mother to child.

Health experts say that as many as 5,000 South African babies are born HIV-
positive every month, fuelling the fastest-growing disease infection rate in the
world.

Mbeki, who has made clear his contempt for the international pharmaceutical
industry - ''the profit takers who are benefiting from the scourge of HIV/AIDS,"
his office recently called them - apparently stumbled into his latest AIDS
controversy while surfing the Internet.

One of the more prominent AIDS-dissident Web sites belongs to Duesberg, a
professor of molecular and cell biology who shares his lab with Rasnick at
Berkeley. His site is devoted to spreading the dissident manifesto, that
''various AIDS diseases are brought on by the long-term consumption of
recreational drugs and AZT" and other drugs that treat AIDS.

In essence, Duesberg declares that despite thousands of medical studies, there
is still no conclusive proof that HIV causes AIDS.

Further, he asserts that the scientific establishment is cynically propagating
AIDS with the very anti-retroviral drugs used to treat it.

As for AIDS in Africa, where 70 per cent of the world's people with HIV live and
where almost no one has access to expensive drugs such as AZT, he and other
dissenters argue that the AIDS phenomenon is caused by common ailments linked to
hunger and poverty.

Duesberg's Web site points out that his funding has dried up as a result of his
scientific heresy and he claims the U.S. government has tried to silence him
with bribes.

Says Duesberg of Mbeki's recent actions: ''I assume that the many beneficiaries
of (the accepted AIDS) hypothesis are now concerned that, for the first time, a
head of state who is independent of the U.S. government has called this
unproductive and potentially very detrimental hypothesis into question.

''The current AIDS orthodoxy may be forced at last to prove its case."

Rasnick is even more pointed.

''What's behind all these shrill attacks on Mbeki?" asks the biochemist. ''It's
thousands of activists and scientists who fear they're going to be out of a
billion-dollar business."

But what the world's AIDS community seems to be registering in this strange
debate isn't so much fear as genuine bafflement.

''If these are the persons Mbeki is consulting, then it is absolutely worrisome
for South Africa," says Andrew Leigh-Brown, the pioneering AIDS geneticist at
the University of Edinburgh who challenged the dissidents' assertions a decade
ago, when they first emerged.

''What we're talking about here is a very small group of people who for whatever
reasons chose to ignore the vast, accumulated bulk of scientific evidence.

''They're flat-earthers. It's nonsense."

Among the studies proving the HIV-AIDS link, Leigh-Brown cites five years of
anti-HIV drug trials that have largely emptied hospitals of AIDS patients in the
developed world. In Africa, he notes that condom use has cut AIDS rates, showing
that the disease is, in fact, sexually transmissible.

As for the dissidents' assertion that poverty is responsible for AIDS-like
illnesses, medical experts point out that in countries such as Botswana, where
poverty has eased, the incidence of the killer disease nonetheless has rocketed.

''I feel truly embarrassed for my government," says Malegapuru Makgoba, an
immunologist and president of the Medical Research Council of South Africa.

''I don't think anyone knows where this thinking is coming from. It makes us
look absolutely lost, under siege."

Makgoba is one of several high-profile South African scientists who have not
been invited to join the government's AIDS panel. But if the panel's agenda
includes discussions about the HIV-AIDS link, he says he wouldn't participate
even if he had been invited.

It's a sentiment shared by others in South Africa, where the debate over AIDS
has become so poisoned that the government's concrete efforts - such as condom
distribution and education campaigns - have been utterly eclipsed by
controversy.

''Mbeki's panel? Who the hell cares?" says AIDS activist Charlene Smith, who
notes that 75 per cent of pediatric deaths at Johannesburg public hospitals are
now AIDS-related.

''We're dying down here. Play all the intellectual games you want on the
Internet, but we're dying down here."

Let's start facing Aids and stop fearing its victims

                               December 15, 1998

Alan John


PADDY Chew has Aids, and now that he has stepped forward to let everyone know
that, you can expect to see a lot more of him.

On Saturday, he broke free of the anonymity behind which every person with HIV
and Aids exists, when he spoke at Singapore's first Aids conference.

The next day, he was on Page One of The Sunday Times. In future he expects to
feature prominently in Aids awareness publicity, and hopes to write a book too.

At last Singapore has a real face for a disease that has shattered families and
shows no sign of abating.

At last, reporters will not have to start their stories saying: "David (not his
real name) has Aids."

Paddy Chew is a brave man for stepping out of the shadows, and in my books, he
is a hero. But while I salute him, I also worry for him.

Stepping out to address the audience at a conference was one thing. It is quite
another matter now for him to step out of his home, have a cup of coffee in a
kopitiam, ride the MRT, go to the movies, or sit on a bench near a children's
playground.

Will Singaporeans react to him with warmth, or do they now have a face to shrink
from and avoid?

As a journalist, I had long hoped for the day when someone with Aids would say,
Look At Me, and not insist on being photographed in silhouette.

But a year ago I became an Aids volunteer and began to understand why nobody
with the human immunodeficiency virus or Aids had previously dared to go public
here.

Every person with HIV and Aids whom I have met in the past year has had a
powerful story to tell, and if it were told, would help others to avoid making
mistakes that could lead to HIV infection.

But as a volunteer, I have also felt an intense protectiveness for the people
with Aids I have met.

They are vulnerable individuals, and in telling their stories openly, risk a
great deal for themselves and the people closest to them, because there is still
too much ignorance and unnecessary fear surrounding HIV and Aids in Singapore.
CHANGING AIDS KALEIDOSCOPE

SINGAPORE'S first HIV infections were discovered in 1985, and since then a lot
has changed -- not least that Aids ceased long ago to be a "gay plague"
afflicting homosexual men primarily.

With rising statistics of HIV infection and Aids through the 1990s, heterosexual
men now make up the clear majority of infections, contracted mainly from sex
with prostitutes here and abroad.

Most of the people with HIV and Aids are men in their 20s and 30s, and there is
a clear band of infected older men in their 50s and 60s.

A large proportion are married men, and that has begun to alter the Aids picture
yet again. We end this decade seeing women with HIV and Aids, mostly married
women, including faithful wives infected by husbands who strayed. When women
have HIV, their babies can get infected, and Singapore has begun recording these
too.

At Saturday's Aids conference, Health Minister Yeo Cheow Tong highlighted the
concern about this new and rising trend of women and children with HIV and Aids,
and urged pregnant women to opt for HIV screening that is now easily available
here.

It is bad enough when families lose their breadwinner prematurely when a man
gets Aids. The tragedy worsens a thousand-fold when both father and mother die,
making orphans of children, or when children are themselves infected.

Ten years ago, nobody predicted that by the year 2000, Aids would target
heterosexual men, women and children here. What will the picture look like 10
years from today? Are we going to see many more women with Aids?

Will we have growing numbers of Aids children who, with treatment, will be able
to go to school where they will learn and play alongside other healthy children?
ACCEPTANCE OR CONDEMNATION?

PADDY Chew's coming out, and how Singaporeans respond to him, will give us an
idea of how society will accept or reject people with HIV and Aids, and which
directions Aids education and awareness-raising must take.

Some people who read his story on Sunday and noted that he was a man who partied
hard and had sex with both men and women, will come away saying he deserved his
fate.

People with Aids know only too well that, because they contracted HIV from risky
sex, there are those who will see Aids as "punishment" for their wrongdoing.

When married men go to prostitutes and bring HIV home, they will face anger and
rejection from those closest to them, and condemnation from others who find out.

We remain a society in which talking about sex openly makes people
uncomfortable. Parents avoid it, teachers prefer that their students would just
read the chapter rather than discuss it.

Sex is black or white for believers of religions with strict rules which say sex
is for marriage only, not before or outside of it.

But Aids cuts across religions, and tells us that people of even the strictest
religions break the rules.

Doctors, social workers, counsellors, teachers and clergy know that there is a
lot of sex happening well before marriage, and outside of it.

BUSTING THE MYTHS

ARE we equipping young people with the knowledge they need to make good choices
in life, and protect themselves from HIV?

UNAids official Werasit Sittirai, the keynote speaker at Saturday's conference,
recalled what a teenage girl dying of Aids once told him.

If only she had been taught the right stuff in school, she said. If only she had
been given the information which would have helped her to live, not die young.

There is reason to worry in Singapore, if what a social worker told the
conference is anything to go by. She said that teenagers at a recent camp for
students from Jurong schools had a session when they were asked to write down
questions and comments about sex.

Many were obviously curious and already experimenting, despite having less than
adequate information.

Like the girl who wrote that she and her boyfriend were already having sex, but
she was confident she would not get pregnant because they always did it standing
up.

Young people need access to better information, and early enough, to avoid
becoming part of the HIV statistics in their 20s.

We now know that HIV spreads in very specific ways, through unprotected sex with
an infected person, when drug abusers inject drugs, share needles and syringes,
through blood transfusions, and from mother to child.

For the majority of people who will not get Aids because they do not engage in
risky sex with strangers, do not have multiple partners, never pay for sex, and
do not inject drugs, it is important that we now also know more about the ways
in which HIV does not spread.

You do not get HIV by being in the same room as an infected person, sitting next
to him on the bus, shaking hands, holding or even kissing him.

You do not get HIV by drinking out of the same glass, using the same fork and
spoon, or using chopsticks to dip into the same dish.

If an infected colleague, classmate or army buddy sneezes or coughs at you, you
might catch a cold from him but you will not get HIV. And the list goes on.

But do people know this?

FUNERALS OR BODY BAGS?

A STUDY of 1,500 doctors and dentists here last year found that misconceptions
about HIV and Aids prevail even among health professionals.

Many still believed wrongly that Aids hits homosexuals hardest here, and that
you can get infected by sharing eating utensils.

If doctors and dentists are mistaken about such basic information, imagine what
misconceptions must hold among the rest of the population.

As a volunteer, I have been at the bedside of a man dying of Aids, holding him
close to me, while his family members kept their distance, some staying rooted
at the door of his room.

I came closest to appreciating why such needless fear of Aids exists when a man
I knew died, and I witnessed the rush to get him cremated within 24 hours.

My friend's body was washed, dressed, put into a thick plastic body bag,
zippered shut and kept in a fridge until the funeral, when the bag went into a
casket and was taken directly from the mortuary to the crematorium.

As someone who cared deeply for him, I found it truly awful. To see my friend
one last time, I fumbled with gloved hands to unzip his body bag.

For every family member, friend, or curious stranger who witnesses any part of
this mad dash to the crematorium or cemetery whenever someone with Aids dies,
the message is plain that Aids is something to fear mightily and stay away from.

The treatment of people who die of Aids is unnecessarily terrible and only
serves to reinforce and perpetuate the fears, misconceptions and prejudices of
those who are ignorant or do not care to know about HIV and Aids.

Health authorities explain the rush by saying morticians need to be protected
from infection and Singapore is in the tropics, where dead bodies rot fast.

But morticians can be trained to take precautions when embalming Aids corpses,
and this will be an important step towards according people with Aids the right
to proper, decent wakes and funerals.

In some other countries, this has already changed. The bodies of people with
Aids are embalmed, kept in open caskets at wakes which allow family and loved
ones time to grieve, to touch the dead, to say goodbye.

We will start to remove so much needless fear the day the existing rules on
disposal of Aids corpses are changed.

After all these years too, so many people with Aids die in hospital when they
ought to spend their last days in a hospice.

Is fear of Aids standing in the way of Singapore having an Aids hospice or
having dedicated wards at any of our hospices?

If it is, then those who fear it need educating. For what it is worth, I know at
least 20 volunteers who would be willing to serve in an Aids hospice, if one is
set up here.

When Paddy Chew's time comes, will he spend his last days in a hospice? Will he
have a proper funeral, or will he get the body bag treatment?

For now though, the question is, will he help Singaporeans to start seeing
people with HIV and Aids as deserving of compassion and continued friendship and
love, not of blame and rejection?

Paddy Chew is the first man out, but his is not the only face of Aids in
Singapore. We need more brave people like him to step forward and help everyone
grasp the facts on HIV and Aids, and to show that Aids is something to guard
against, but not fear.

How he is treated from now on will say less about him than about us all. (The
writer is News Editor of The Straits Times.)

Foreign aid dwindles as the pressure mounts;
TOKYO OBSERVED

Japan is in danger of losing its status as the world's largest provider of
development assistance aid as its Government succumbs to fiscal pressures and
growing community scepticism of foreign aid's effectiveness.

Further cuts in Japan's foreign aid or changes to its structure may impact on
several Asian countries, including Indonesia and the Philippines, which have
benefited from a fixed share of Japan's grant aid for more than decade.

The trends observed in Japan are no different from those in other industrialised
nations that have been progressively cutting foreign aid in response to the need
for fiscal consolidation.

Other reasons for cuts in concessional assistance to developing countries have
been the declining strategic and military importance of development aid since
the end of the Cold War and weak public support for aid in some major donor
countries, according to the World Bank.

In its latest report on global development finance, the World Bank said foreign
aid had fallen in nominal terms from $US43.9 billion ($67.13 billion) in 1990 to
$US37.3 billion in 1997.

The picture is even worse when viewed in inflation-adjusted terms. In constant
1990 US dollars, foreign aid has fallen more than 28 per cent since 1990 to
$US31.6 billion.

As a percentage of the gross national product of member countries of the OECD's
Development Assistance Committee, foreign aid has shrunk to 0.25 per cent in
1996, its lowest level since the United Nations adopted a target of 0.7 per cent
of GNP in 1970.

Australia's foreign aid has fallen from more than 0.4 per cent of GNP in 1986 to
an estimated 0.27 per cent in 1997-98. Europe's Maastricht Treaty is likely to
be a further constrain upon real increases in foreign aid flows.

Japan is the single largest cause of the sharp decline in foreign aid in 1996.
Its contribution fell by $US5 billion because of the decline in the value of the
yen and budget cuts.

Pressure for more budget cuts will rise as the recession in Japan cuts into tax
revenues, thereby boosting the budget deficit - already one of the highest in
the industrialised world.

The World Bank points out that the decline in development assistance in the
1980s has not been accompanied by any decline in the need for aid. The number of
people in low-income countries rose from 2.4 billion in 1980 to 3.2 billion in
1995.

The number of people living on less than $US1 a day in developing countries rose
from 1.2 billion in 1987 to 1.3 billion in 1993.

However, public opinion against foreign aid has been increasing, most notably in
the US, which has halved the ratio of net foreign aid to GNP since the
mid-1980s.

Opinion polls show continued public concern over the funds devoted to foreign
aid, the World Bank said.

In Japan, foreign aid is suffering a credibility problem because of a lack of
transparency about its distribution and the entrenchment of vested interests.

Foreign aid in Japan is controlled by 19 ministries and agencies, making the
system incomprehensible from the outside and complicating the effective
dissemination of funds.

A review of Japan's foreign aid, conducted by the Japan Forum on International
Relations and delivered to the Government in March, found that vested interests
in various ministries and in the recipient developing countries were hindering
the country's foreign aid program.

The review found that since 1981, there had been no change in the ratios of
funding for technical co-operation, grant aid and payments to international
organisations, which showed that foreign aid policy decision had had little
impact on the budgeting process.

In Asia, the Philippines and Indonesia had continued to receive from Â¥5 billion
to Â¥15 billion each year in grant aid, despite their access to private capital
flows.

The review said Japan's foreign aid needed to be be dispensed from a more
diplomatic and strategic standpoint to support efforts towards economic
self-reliance.

"While there is no need to imitate the US and conduct 30 to 40 per cent of
bilateral relations within an overall policy context, assistance unequivocally
provided on the basis of foreign policy considerations will receive more active
support from the

Japanese public than is currently seen," the review committee said.

A key recommendation of the committee designed to garner taxpayer support for
Japan's foreign aid is that a new guiding principle be added to the existing
four principles: "Attention will be paid to a country's record of using ODA
[foreign aid] in any form of political corruption."

The review committee said that even with a reduced budget, Japan's foreign aid
could be made more effective. One way of achieving this would be the creation of
an international assistance agency that would be an external organ of the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

More effective use of foreign aid has been a goal of the World Bank for some
years, but developing countries have shown little inclination to reduce the
amount of net concessional aid going to countries with access to private capital
flows.

In fact, while aid assistance to countries with access to private capital flows
has remained static since the mid-1980s, the share of foreign aid going to
low-income countries has been declining in the 1990s.

AIDS and comfort; Gwinnett helping-hand group gets office

BYLINE: By Gail Hagans STAFF WRITERdeaths; organizations; aid; care; medicine;

SECTION: EXTRA; SECTION J; PAGE 01

LENGTH: 489 words


Dorothy Martin of Buford sounds as if she's talking in secret code as she speaks
of PWAs, DDI, AZT and HIV.

But it all comes together when people realize what she's talking about -
A-I-D-S. PWAs are "people with AIDS," DDI and AZT are antiviral drugs, and HIV
stands for the human immunodeficiency virus that causes the disease.

Mrs. Martin is an organizer of AID Gwinnett, a 2-year-old support group that
finally has found a home at 240 Oak St. in Lawrenceville. AID Gwinnett plans to
open its first office there in January.

"I hope we can educate Gwinnett about AIDS, because there are so many people in
this county who have never been near or known anybody with AIDS," Mrs. Martin
said. She lost her son, Bob Martin, to the disease 2 1/2 years ago.

When Peggy Terrell's son died of AIDS, she went to Athens for help because there
wasn't a local counseling group. Now she works with AID Gwinnett and hopes to
make the quest for help easier for other Gwinnett residents.

"If you're in need, you don't want to drive 40 miles to have someone listen to
your problems," Mrs. Martin said.

In 1989, AID Gwinnett assisted six local families. This year, about 100 people -
families, friends and PWAs all over the county and in Lithonia and Monroe - work
with the group, Mrs. Terrell said.

Rehabilitation and group counselor Jeff Erwin meets with AIDS patients and their
families and friends four evenings a week. He works at the Grady Memorial
Hospital Infectious Disease Clinic during the day.

"We try to focus on the emotional issues," Mr. Erwin explained. "The biggest
issue is usually the fear of suffering and dying for the PWAs.

"They're very afraid of that prospect, along with financial suffering, lack of
independence, job security and being alone."

He hears an earful of questions at his sessions: "How do I tell my child? How do
I make people understand? How long do I have to live? How am I going to continue
my life? What about sexual relations?"

One of AID Gwinnett's biggest challenges is making people understand that AIDS
is not just an urban disease. Although more than 166 cases of AIDS have been
reported in Gwinnett, Rockdale and Newton counties, Mr. Erwin believes some
suburbanites still don't understand how widespread the disease is.

"I think people here don't always realize that it could touch their lives. Th
ey're not as aware as they should be," Mrs. Terrell said.

Because of that difference in attitude, AID Gwinnett's approach is different
from that of urban outreach groups, said Ken Lewis, director of the group.

"AIDS is more readily accepted in some areas, but we've had to start 10 steps
behind AID Atlanta," he said. "People out here just don't realize that real
people can get AIDS."

Mr. Lewis added, "It's not about it being a gay disease or a drug addict's
disease - it's about everyone coming together and realizing that it's a human
disease."

Debate on AIDS Research Spending Should Focus on Broader Benefits

BYLINE: MICHAEL SCHRAGE

SECTION: FINANCIAL; PAGE F3; MICHAEL SCRAGE

LENGTH: 1142 words


The question may be curious or hostile, but it's increasingly being asked: Are
we spending too much money on AIDS research relative to other diseases?

On the surface, this question seems reasonable. In reality, it's useless. That
this question is part of the AIDS debate and the inspiration for an emerging
AIDS funding backlash is potentially tragic.

The responsibility -- the fault -- for this rests squarely with the biomedical
research community and AIDS activist groups. They have done a truly lousy job of
articulating the extraordinarily broad range of medical breakthroughs and
benefits that AIDS research can yield. Instead, they have consistently opted to
position AIDS in the policy arena purely as a "special interest" disease
requiring extraordinary measures and an equally extraordinary budget.

No one can rationally argue that combating AIDS doesn't require extraordinary
efforts. But as AIDS-related research consumes a rising portion of the federal
biomedical budget, it's increasingly clear that we need to explore aggressively
the impact of this research beyond AIDS. Although AIDS and its HIV virus is an
infuriatingly elusive and deadly disease, it is not something wholly separate
and distinct from other diseases.

The biomedical research establishment must start viewing AIDS research as more
of a gateway into the nature of viruses, the immune system and molecular
biology. AIDS activists must start building up coalitions with other segments of
the disease research community -- and not just building up budgets.

"The constituents and advocates in HIV research are just now starting to realize
the more global aspects of HIV research," says Dr. Anthony Fauci, who runs the
nation's war on AIDS as director of the National Institute for Allergy and
Infectious Diseases. "We've reached the point that we're not going to be able to
say, 'We need more for AIDS' and get more; we have to be able to show other
benefits."

Although Fauci personally has pointed to spinoff benefits of HIV research, he
acknowledges that the research community has been so consumed in AIDS research
itself that there have been few formal efforts to transfer AIDS-gleaned insights
to other fields. An Office of Technology Assessment survey published earlier
this year confirmed the obvious: Researchers believed that there would be
significant spinoffs from AIDS research. Unfortunately, there's consistently
been a "take it for granted" and "by the way" quality to the discussion of
spinoffs.

"AIDS is such a lightning rod," says Fauci. "Spinoffs get lost in the commotion
and smoke of all the controversy."

But it is Fauci's responsibility -- and the responsibility of the AIDS activist
community -- to see that they do not. It is in no one's interest to define the
impact of AIDS research narrowly.

The Nixon administration's war on cancer failed to generate a "cure" for cancer.
Instead, it spawned the knowledge infrastructure of molecular biology that made
biotechnology possible and put us in a position to begin to deal with diseases
such as AIDS.

The fact is that diseases are not all tucked away in neat, discrete
compartments. Fundamental structures and interactions make medical research more
interdisciplinary today than at any other time in history. Precisely because we
are investing so much in AIDS research, we must take every step possible to make
sure that the results have as far-reaching an impact as possible.  "Virus
research in general has become completely dominated by HIV," says David
Baltimore, the Nobel Prize-winning molecular biologist who is president of
Rockefeller University. The research "has given us a much more precise
understanding of viral interactions with cells. ... The one area where it may
drive technology is in drug design and vaccine design."

What's more, Baltimore says, the research is "almost certain to tell us that
there are types of genetic controls in normal cells that we have never
imagined."

"We still have a lot of spadework to do in basic research," Fauci says. "We have
to understand a lot more: the expression of the viral gene and the interaction
with the cellular gene function."

That kind of basic research has the broadest possible implications. It's like
learning how to read: Once you can read a short story, learning to read poetry
or novels is less of a challenge. Fundamental insights into the HIV virus and
the immune system should be directly transferable to insights into other
diseases. Fauci argues that AIDS research can't help but offer insights into
degenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis and autoimmune diseases such as
lupus. The opportunistic infections that attack people with AIDS also attack
people who aren't infected with the HIV virus.

The point is simple: AIDS has become the engine for critical biomedical research
in this country. The issue isn't, "Are we spending too much on AIDS research?"
We could ask that of any budget for any serious disease, be it lung cancer or
Alzheimer's. It is, "Are we getting the maximum return for the maximum number of
people?"

As Dr. Leroy Hood, the Bowles professor of biology at California Institute of
Technology and director of the National Science Foundation's Science and
Technology Center in Biotechnology, says: "If we're going to spend this much
money on AIDS research, the mission should be a very broad one." Hood and other
researchers want to see AIDS money set aside for developing new technologies to
enhance viral diagnostics and intervention.

None of this should reduce the primary focus on AIDS. On the contrary, a flow of
spinoffs should consolidate this society's willingness to commit resources.
Fortunately, even the most radical segments of the AIDS activist community are
beginning to understand that it can acquire more resources to fight AIDS by
stressing the uniqueness of the disease less, and emphasizing the insights it
offers for all.

"The real bottom line is that we're going to have to make common cause with
those other [disease lobbying] groups to enhance all of the biomedical budget,"
asserts Mark Harrington, a member of the treatment and data committee of the
AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power.

"The need to institutionalize the AIDS research process and transfer it to other
efforts is clear," says Jean McGuire, who runs the AIDS Action Council in
Washington. "It is a necessary part of building support."

People who challenge the level of AIDS research funding should appreciate that
an investment in AIDS research isn't an investment in a special interest group
but an investment in the public health.

It's time for the National Institutes of Health, Congress, the Bush
administration and AIDS activists to encourage aggressively a wide array of
research spinoffs to reinforce that.

SECRET TESTING FOR AIDS PLANNED

SOURCE: QNP

BYLINE: KENNEDY N

LENGTH: 583 words


Secret testing for AIDS planned By NICK KENNEDY HOSPITAL patients could soon be
tested for AIDS without knowledge of the test or the results. Blood samples
taken to help diagnose a patient's illness could be tested for AIDS if the
Federal Government approves a request by the National Council on AIDS. It has
been an offence in Queensland since 1984 for an AIDS patient knowingly to infect
another person. Other States have enacted similar legislation. Secret AIDS
testing is common in the United States and the United Kingdom, where it began
about four years ago. The NCA was formed earlier this year to replace the
National Advisory Committee on AIDS and the AIDS Task Force. Prof. Tony Basten,
chief adviser to the council, said it was a case of the health of the nation
versus the rights of the individual. ""It is the best way we have of finding out
how many people have AIDS," he said. ""We support voluntary testing but the
overall statistics don't give a true picture of the problem. ""We feel anonymous
testing is the best way to test for AIDS," said Prof. Basten, who is chief
federal adviser on medical and scientific aspects of AIDS. Prof. Basten was
speaking to delegates to the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons' general
scientific meeting in Brisbane. Queensland AIDS Council president Mr Bill Rutkin
criticised the proposal and said patients should know what was happening to
them. ""It is far less traumatic for the individual if they know what is
happening to them," he said. Prof. Basten said the official AIDS figure of 813
known cases was more than five years old. ""All the diagnosed cases were
contracted at least five years ago. It is vital to our research and to the
Government that we know how many people in the next five years will need special
treatment. ""Then the Government will know how much money is needed to help cope
with the problem," he said. ""If we knew how many people have AIDS now, instead
of how many contracted it five years ago, we would be able to handle the
situation a lot better and anonymous testing would help us do that." He admitted
that rights of the individual could be breached by anonymous testing, but said
the health of the nation was at risk. He said health care establishments had to
improve their level of infection control to beat AIDS and infection controls
should be upgraded. ""I'm sure there is room for improvement and now is the time
it must be done," he said. Prof. Basten said he wanted health care
establishments to put in place infection control guidelines based on those of
the former AIDS task force. He said they had to accept their legal and ethical
responsibilities to staff and patients. ""That includes compensation to staff
who accidentally become infected with the AIDS virus. Those who get AIDS also
have responsibilities, including notifying health workers of their infected
status," he said. AIDS carriers had to consent to undergo tests for communicable
diseases which would assist in further management, he said. ""Governments have
to accept that communicable diseases, including AIDS, are a public health issue,
as well as a social one. They have to endorse the infection control measures,"
he said. The State Health Department was told of three more confirmed carriers
of the AIDS virus in Queensland last month. The Health Minister, Mrs Harvey,
said this brought to 535 the number of people who had contracted the disease in
Queensland. Fifty have died. Saliva may block AIDS virus, Page 11.

AIDS exposure forecast at 21 cases each day

BYLINE: JOAN BRECKENRIDGE; GAM

LENGTH: 578 words


BY  JOAN BRECKENRIDGE
 The Globe and Mail
  Over the next 18 months, an average of 21 people a day are going to be
exposed to the AIDS virus in Toronto, according to Councillor Jack Layton,
the chairman of the city's board of health.

However, only about five people a day will test positive for AIDS
antibodies and be reported to the medical officer of health because people
are choosing not to take the acquired immune deficiency syndrome test, Mr.
Layton said at a one-day conference in Toronto on AIDS in the workplace.

Statisticians believe that for every reported positive test for AIDS
antibodies, there are at least five more people who have been exposed to
the virus but do not know it. Many people are afraid to be tested because
they think a positive test equals a death sentence.

If the health department's projections prove to be correct, the number
of people in Toronto who have been exposed to AIDS will increase by about
11,500 by the fall of 1989. At least one-third, or about 3,800, will
develop AIDS.

Currently, 2,820 people in Toronto have tested positive for AIDS
antibodies.

Although there has been an average of 30 reports each week since 1985,
the number rose to a new high of 111 cases last week, Mr. Layton said.
"That's a staggering amount."

Mr. Layton said he finds it disturbing that the slow progression of
AIDS into the heterosexual population seems to be making heterosexuals
complacent about the illness.

Among the reported cases of exposure to AIDS in Toronto are 43
heterosexual women who contracted the disease from men who had engaged in
high-risk behavior. Most of the rest are gay men.

Mr. Layton said heterosexuals must not forget that AIDS is entering
their group through bisexuals or men who engage in homosexual activities
and then go home and have sex with their wives.

Although Canada has only a small number of intravenous drug abusers
with AIDS, the experience in the United States has shown that "once it
takes hold in the drug-using community, it races through (it) at an
unprecedented rate," he said.

Dr. Tom Porter, medical director for Imperial Life Assurance Co. of
Toronto, said that as the number of AIDS cases increases, corporations
must implement AIDS policies before an employee with AIDS throws the
company into turmoil.

In the fall of 1986, Imperial Life put together a comprehensive AIDS
education and policy package for the staff. No employee with AIDS or a
positive antibody test will be fired, Dr. Porter said.

Although none of the company's employees has AIDS, Dr. Porter believes
that when the time comes there will be no panic. He does not anticipate
demands that the employee be fired or anger against the company for not
being prepared to deal with the situation.

"The company's prepared to let go of the person who can't cope with
working with the AIDS patient," Dr. Porter said.

Connie Nakatsu, a lawyer who has represented people with AIDS, said
that companies that decide to be less than benevolent and fire employees
with AIDS will probably not be subjected to long, drawn-out court battles.

Most people with AIDS settle out of court or drop the case entirely
because "going through litigation is a tiring, consuming process," she
said, adding that people with AIDS realize they may die before the case is
tried.

There have been 1,608 cases of AIDS reported in Canada and about 50 per
cent of the people have died. About 50,000 people are believed to have
been exposed to the virus. The Federal Centre For AIDS is predicting 7,000
AIDS cases by 1991.

New focus on foreign aid solutions

BYLINE: GREG SHERIDAN FOREIGN EDITOR, EXCLUSIVE

SECTION: THENATION; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 653  words


FOREIGN Minister Julie Bishop will today introduce a revolutionary new aid
policy that will radically transform the aims and methods of Australia's $5
billion annual program.

As part of what it will label the "new aid paradigm", the government will
establish a Development Innovation Hub within the Department of Foreign Affairs
and Trade that will draw on experts and creative thinkers from the private
sector to work on the most intractable problems in aid and development.

The government will fund this hub with $140 million over four years. Ms Bishop
is using the Stanford Business School's course on entrepreneurhship as her
operational model. In this course, students are given problems to solve and the
most effective solutions are then scaled up commercially.

Ms Bishop is determined to inject new thinking into the aid process and to
involve the private sector as never before.

As part of this, Australia will be a founding participant in the Global
Development Innovation Ventures program, which is also supported by the US and
Britain.

In a move likely to upset aid traditionalists, the Abbott government will
strongly emphasise aid for infrastructure development. This flows from the
government's conviction that aid itself is not an answer to poverty, and that
economic development is the only long-term solution to poverty.

Traditional aid groups have frowned on aid support for innovation as the money
goes mostly to private sector companies.

In last month's federal budget the government cut the aid Continued on Page 6
Continued from Page 1 program by $650 million and stabilised the aid budget at
$5bn a year for two years. It will rise in line with the Consumer Price Index
after that. This figure makes Australia one of the top 10 aid donors within the
OECD.

The aid budget will still carry a heavy emphasis on health and disease
prevention, and the empowerment of women and girls. However the government will
move away from the direct provision of services to aid recipient states and try
to work to empower aid recipient governments to deliver their own services.

This is designed in part to avoid long-term aid dependency.

As part of this, the aid budget will devote $30m a year to fund medical
research. Some of this research can take place in Australia, provided it is
directly concerned with an aid task.

The government also envisages supporting research in the Asian region, at
medical research centres and hospitals that can carry out research directly
related to local conditions. In time it is envisaged that the University of
Papua New Guinea could receive funds under this program.

The government hopes that some Pacific medical institutions could enhance their
reputation and performance to the extent that they will more easily attract
overseas doctors and researchers.

A key element of the new aid paradigm is accountability. The government will set
out stringent performance benchmarks for aid programs. If an aid program is
consistently failing to meet the benchmark then the government will acknowledge
failure and move on, cancelling the aid project concerned and devoting that aid
money to a different project.

The government believes that too many aid projects are funded in perpetuity
despite continually failing to achieve their targets.

The Abbott government is determined to create an entirely different culture
around the Australian aid program. It will reduce and consolidate the number of
programs to make evaluation and delivery smoother and to enable it to keep
better track of what money is being spent and how effective this is.

More than 90 per cent of the aid budget will in future be directed toward the
Indo-Pacific region. This reflects the government's view it should specialise
more, with Europe taking more responsibility for Africa and the Middle East and
Australia making its contribution overwhelmingly in Southeast Asia, South Asia
and the South Pacific.JULIE BISHOP P14

AusAIDs Aids team visits WHP

BYLINE: By MAL TAIME

SECTION: HIGHLANDS POST; Pg. 16

LENGTH: 456 words


PAPUA New Guinea is losing the battle against the spread of HIV/AIDS and this is
a serious problem that needs to be squared up to make sure we win the battle to
save the lives of innocent people.

Parliamentarian HIV/AIDS chairman and Anglimp/South Wahgi MP Jamie
Maxtone-Graham said this in Minj, Jiwaka Province, last week.

Mr Maxtone-Graham said if Papua New Guinea continued to lose the battle against
the spread of HIV/AIDS, the virus would wipe out the bulk of the population and
it would destroy this beautiful resourceful country.

He was in his electorate with Aus-AIDs PNG AIDS office including Australian
Ambassador on HIV/AIDS, Aus-AID deputy director general Margaret Callan, PNG
AIDS Program co-ordinator Anne Malcolm and Donna Jean Nicholson to visit and see
what is happening to tackle the spread of HIV/AIDS.

The high powered delegation led by Mr Murray Proctor were in the province last
week to learn firsthand information about the impact of HIV/AIDS epidemic in the
province and met with key partners who were part of the response team.

Mr Maxtone-Graham said as Parliamentary HIV/AIDS chairman he would make sure he
talked strongly on the floor of National Parliament to ensure the Government
increased the budget for HIV/AIDS.

He said public servants, especially health workers, were not submitting the
right information to the Government, and that was why the government had cut its
budget for HIV/AIDS.

Mr Maxtone-Graham said he was giving privilege to his district to support the
program for HIV/AIDS to address the issue.

He said the best way to control and fight against the spread of the virus was to
empower the rural community and he had taken the task to built community
resource centre to empower his people.

We must think positive of what is going to happen to us and not to sit idle
because the HIV/AIDS virus is becoming one of the silent killer and once it
infect the people we are surprise but this is too late, we must at least wake up
and beware that HIV/AIDS is around to kill us and we must do something and
prepare ourselves to win the battle against HIV/AIDS, Mr Maxtone-Graham said.

He also approved K10,000 for Kinimkinim Wikep Tingim Laip centre to upgrade its
facilities to benefit the people.

Australian Ambassador to HIV/AIDS Murray Proctor said HIV/AIDS was a major
problem in the countryand the Australian Government was trying to help in many
ways it can to minimise the spread of AIDS.

Mr Proctor said he was impressed with people working at all levels to decrease
HIV/AIDS infected rates and this was very important.

He said HIV/AIDS was a problem to PNG and it needed to work hard to educate
young people on prevention, testing and also educate mothers not to pass the
virus to their unborn babies.

Children 'forgotten victims' of disease

BYLINE: DOUG WARD; VANCOUVER SUN

SECTION: NEWS; VANCOUVER AIDS CONFERENCE; Pg. A15

LENGTH: 466 words


Children are the forgotten victims of the global AIDS epidemic, especially in
the Third World, speakers said at a post-AIDS conference symposium Friday.

The United Nations estimates that more than 1.5 million children under the age
of five are infected with the AIDS virus while another 8.7 million under the age
of 15 have lost parents to HIV infection.

"They tend to be very invisible in the struggle. They are quite forgotten,"
Rebecca Sutherns, a policy officer with World Vision Canada, said.

Sutherns was a participant in a Vancouver symposium on the issue of children
affected by AIDS. Many of the participants were delegates to the international
AIDS conference, which ended Thursday.

She said that children have no independent voice and are outside the mainstream
AIDS movement.

"Unlike most other AIDS-affected groups, children can not be part of the
identity politics which characterizes AIDS activism."

Sutherns also said that the politics of AIDS activism could be working against
children.

"AIDS activists have long rejected, with some success, the dichotomy of innocent
versus deserving victims of HIV/AIDS.

"Yet children epitomize innocence and perhaps embracing their cause may raise
fears within AIDS service organizations of revitalizing the prejudice which
leads to the guilty/innocent victim construct.

"It also introduces another player into the competition for already scarce
resources."

Sutherns said the problem of AIDS orphans is massive in African countries. "The
closest thing I can compare it to is what it must have been like living through
the black plague.

"You're driving through villages where there are freshly dug graves in virtually
every household."

Sutherns compared the epidemic to a slow-motion catastrophe, which demands a
relief operation.

Yet most Third World aid groups have shifted away from relief operations,
Sutherns said, preferring to spend money on projects that lead to long-term,
sustainable development.

So children's aid falls to the bottom of the agenda.

"It is often seen simply as well-meaning but misguided charity and is not given
the legitimacy of other approaches such as human rights, gender or the
environment."

Dr. Geoff Foster, a pediatrician from Zimbabwe, also said that AIDS orphans are
not a high priority for international aid groups.

"Donors and agencies see it as a bottomless pit. It's a widespread disaster
without the epicentre of an earthquake. And it doesn't have an end in sight."

Foster said that about one-fifth of Zimbabwe's adult population is infected with
HIV.

"We've got over 25 per cent of children losing a parent within 10 to 15 years
time. So we have to put programs into place to support children where they are
in their families and communities. "

Poll Finds Knowledge About AIDS Increasing

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. KAGAY

SECTION: Section C; Page 5; Column 3; Science Desk

LENGTH: 465 words


AMERICANS show improved knowledge about AIDS as well as increased personal
acquaintance with victims of AIDS, and half of all adults now say they have
acted to avoid getting AIDS themselves, according to the latest New York
Times/CBS News Poll.

Forty-nine percent of the 1,347 adults interviewed June 1 to 3 answered "yes"
when asked, "Is there anything in particular you have done to avoid getting
AIDS?" The nationwide telephone poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or
minus three percentage points.

When respondents were asked what steps they had taken, three answers dominated
the list: limiting the number of sexual partners, having safer sex and
abstaining from sex.

Some groups were particularly likely to report taking steps to avoid AIDS: 72
percent of single people under 45 years of age, 70 percent of blacks and 60
percent of people living in large urban areas.

The poll also showed that a growing number of Americans are personally
acquainted with someone who has died from AIDS (26 percent), someone who has
AIDS (16 percent), or someone who has tested positive for H.I.V., the virus that
causes AIDS, but has not yet developed AIDS (10 percent). One-third of American
adults (34 percent) know at least one person who fits one of those categories.

Self-professed knowledge about AIDS has also increased. In 1985 only 11 percent
said they knew "a lot" about AIDS. That increased to 31 percent by 1989, 40
percent by 1991 and 45 percent in the latest survey.

Understanding Transmission

The poll also showed gains in the public's understanding of particular ways AIDS
is or is not transmitted. For instance, 79 percent now say correctly that
someone cannot get AIDS by drinking from a glass just used by a person with
AIDS; in 1985 only 34 percent gave that answer. In the latest poll, 89 percent
said correctly that someone could not get AIDS from a toilet seat; in 1985 only
49 percent gave that answer.

Ninety-six percent know someone can get AIDS by having sex with a member of the
opposite sex, and 98 percent know someone can get AIDS from a blood transfusion.

But the poll showed that some people are confused about whether donating blood
poses any danger to the donor. While 67 percent said someone could not get AIDS
"when they donate their own blood to a blood bank," 28 percent said someone
could get AIDS from doing that.

This misperception could be related to needles, said Diane Colasanto, president
of Princeton Survey Research Associates. "In 1989 we recorded a big increase in
public worries about getting AIDS from giving blood at a time when there was
media attention to reducing the spread of AIDS by reducing the use of shared
needles," she said. "We speculated people might be connecting AIDS with any use
of needles."

Ethnic communities to receive information in native languages

IN ETHNOCULTURAL communities, there's no such thing as a simple AIDS awareness
and prevention program. In the Punjabi language, for example, there are no words
to describe certain sexual practices such as anal intercourse, which can lead to
the transmission of the human immunodefiency virus.

There's more than just language problems.

Health and community activists recognize that in addition to dealing with
homophobia and AIDS-phobia, ethnocultural communities are also caught in a
public-health feedback loop: Since no AIDS-prevention information has been aimed
at them, AIDS isn't perceived as their problem but as one affecting only white,
gay men.

As well, many deny AIDS exists in their community because they feel the stigma
associated with it would further add to their marginalization as immigrants and
refugees, said Guninder Mumick, multicultural health-education consultant for
the city's health department.

"There has been so much denial that gays exist or that the gay lifestyle exists.
In our communities, there is a perception that there are no gays or that it is
only a disease of white, gay men," she said.

But the silence about AIDS and HIV transmission is about to change.

In the past year, various health professionals and community activists have been
working on public-education programs for various ethnocultural groups.

Printed AIDS information in five languages may be available for general
distribution throughout immigrant-settlement agencies as early as next month,
said Mary Regester, senior instructor at the school of nursing at the University
of B.C.

Regester has been working on a federally and provincially funded multicultural
AIDS prevention package for more than a year.

It involves a series of two- and three-minute culturally appropriate video
vignettes about HIV transmission in Vietnamese, Punjabi, Spanish, Cantonese and
English (for the Jamaican community). Designed for public viewing and workshops,
the video package's manual also addresses homophobia and how various
ethnocultural communities can learn from the gay community's response to AIDS.

The lack of attention directed at immigrant-refugee communities about HIV
transmission and AIDS isn't only the result of denial.

Al-Qamar Sangha, a social worker involved in HIV education in the Indo-Canadian
community, pointed to a program guide for the coming sixth annual B.C. AIDS
Conference sponsored by various provincially funded institutions.

Not one panel or workshop deals with how HIV or AIDS affects immigrants and
refugees.

"The message is that AIDS and HIV are not an issue within the immigrant/refugee
communities," Sangha said.

"Information and images about HIV and AIDS for ethnocultural communities on
safer sex, how HIV is transmitted and general AIDS awareness just don't exist in
Vancouver. As a Canadian-born South Asian, HIV and AIDS awareness in the
community is a big issue for me."

For the Chinese-Canadian community, a big breakthrough occurred in April when
the recently formed Asian-Support AIDS Project took part in an Asian health fair
at Sunset Community Centre.

It was the first time an Asian-Canadian group had distributed in Vancouver AIDS
information in languages spoken by many Chinese-Canadians.

The sixth annual Walk for Aids around the Stanley Park seawall starts at 9:30
a.m. Sunday, with registration at Ceperley Park near Second Beach. The actual
walk begins at 11 a.m.

Registration forms and pledge booklets are available at Starbucks Coffee
outlets, Little Sister's Book Emporium, North Shore Credit Union, and the Walk
for AIDS office at 1107 Seymour Street. Completed pledge books can also be
dropped off prior to the walk at any North Shore Credit Union and B.C. Teachers
Credit Union. For more information, call Walk for AIDS '92 at 893-2254.

How Fafsa's New Reliance on Older Tax Data Could Affect Colleges

BYLINE: Beckie Supiano

SECTION: ADMINISTRATION; News

LENGTH: 1549  words

ABSTRACT

The chance to apply for aid earlier, using so-called prior-prior-year tax
records, is widely seen as a win for students, but much will depend on how
colleges and states respond.

FULL TEXT

[[photo id="73376" crop="landscape_650x433" align="right" size="half-width"
class=""]]The change in the federal student-aid application process that the
Obama administration announced last month may at first sound arcane. Students
will be able to apply earlier for aid, and to use older tax data, a practice
with the requisite wonky name "prior prior year" or PPY.

But the change, observers say, could have big implications - and not only for
financial-aid offices.

The change won't take effect until around this time next year, so no one knows
for sure how it will play out. Here's what we can tell you so far:

What exactly is changing?

Currently, the Free Application for Federal Student Aid becomes available on
January 1, and students and families fill it out using the financial information
on their taxes from the previous year. That timing is awkward and inconvenient
because most people have not yet filed the prior year's taxes. Families can try
to file their taxes early, hold off on applying for aid until later in the year,
or apply using estimates and correct their information later.

That's going to change next fall. The application will be available earlier, in
October. And instead of using information from the previous year's taxes,
students and families will use their financial information from the
"prior-prior" year.

How has this announcement been received?

Using prior-prior year tax data is widely seen as a win for students and has
been a mainstay of recommendations for improving the financial-aid system for
years. "It finally gives us the opportunity to have the cost conversation sooner
in the process," says Chris George, dean of admissions and financial aid at St.
Olaf College.

But not everyone who'll be explaining PPY to families is completely up to speed.
A survey conducted this past May and June by the National Association for
College Admission Counseling found that 9.8 percent of admission officers were
"very familiar" and 47.2 "somewhat familiar" with PPY.

How will prior-prior year benefit students?

The famously frustrating process of applying for aid should become much easier
for many students and families. Because nearly everyone will have filed their
taxes for the year in question, families won't have to worry about estimating
their income and correcting it later.

The switch to prior-prior year will also enable many more applicants to take
advantage of the Internal Revenue Service's data-retrieval tool, which they can
use to transfer information from their taxes to the Fafsa form. That leaves
applicants with fewer relatively straightforward questions to answer.

Prospective students will also be able to learn their expected family
contribution (a figure that drives need-based aid from the government and most
colleges) the fall before they enroll.

Those benefits are certain, but advocates of PPY hope there will be others,
since the change will enable colleges to send out financial-aid awards earlier
in the admissions process.

What would earlier aid awards mean for applicants?

Applicants would have more time to consider what their various college options
would cost before deciding where to enroll. As it stands, that key part of the
decision process lasts only a few weeks for many applicants. With more time to
make an informed decision, the thinking goes, students will be less likely to
overborrow, or to enroll in a college that's such a financial stretch that they
later drop out.

Will students file their Fafsas earlier?

Just because families can apply for aid as early as October doesn't mean that
they will, says Sandy Baum, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute. "We know
lots of people procrastinate in filling this form out," she says, for reasons
that go beyond its timing and complexity.

But even if families don't file any sooner, colleges could still send out
earlier awards under PPY, says Phillip Asbury, deputy director of the office of
scholarships and student aid at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
That's because right now some families complete the form using estimated tax
information, and some colleges won't award aid until they've updated it with
real numbers. Eliminating that two-step process will help speed things along.

Are colleges actually going to send aid awards earlier?

Some have already committed to moving their aid processes up - the National
Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators has a list. Many others are
waiting to see what their competitors decide to do, says Justin Draeger,
president of the association.

How easily colleges can change their timing depends on some other players. The
software vendors most colleges rely on to package aid will have to receive and
incorporate updates from the federal government more quickly, for one thing. And
colleges that use the College Board's CSS Profile form to award their own aid
are still waiting to hear if it, too, will be switching to prior-prior year
data.

Need-based aid hinges on two variables: what students are deemed able to pay,
and the college's cost of attendance. Colleges don't package aid for all
applicants - only those who've both filed for aid and been accepted for
admission. So one big question is if some colleges that follow the traditional
calendar will change the timing of their admissions decisions. Colleges that
have rolling admissions, though, may already be well poised to pair admissions
offers and aid awards under PPY.

There's also the matter of cost of attendance. Many colleges don't finalize
tuition for the coming year until sometime in the spring semester. Setting
tuition earlier would be a big undertaking, but some college officials say they
are at least considering it. Even if tuition is not yet finalized, colleges
could send out estimated aid awards. Some already do that for students admitted
under early-admissions programs. And public colleges sometimes send estimated
awards because state budgeting issues have delayed decisions about tuition or
state grant programs, or both.

Speaking of state grants, how will the switch affect them?

The National Association of State Student Grant and Aid Programs supported the
push for PPY, but it's also grateful that states have a year to figure out how
to make it work, says Frank Ballmann, the group's director of federal relations.
"For a lot of states, the more problematic issue is not the switch to prior
prior," Mr. Ballmann says, "but the earlier application."

States have to balance their budgets, so they don't have bottomless pools of
grant aid. To ration, some states award fixed grants on a first-come,
first-served basis, while others provide a variable amount to everyone who files
by the deadline. That means adjusting the timing could change the mix of which
students receive state grants. One troubling possibility in some states is that
there could be less money available for community-college students, whose
admissions process tends to unfold closer to the start of the academic year, Mr.
Ballmann says.

Are there other possible drawbacks for students?

Several enrollment managers wondered whether the Fafsa change might encourage
more colleges to consider applicants' ability to pay in their admissions
decisions. Colleges don't necessarily send all of their financial-aid awards out
at once. Some might be inclined to send packages to less-needy applicants as
quickly as possible, says Scott Friedhoff, vice president for enrollment and
college relations at the College of Wooster, and to wait to award or even admit
high-need students until they have a firmer sense of their aid budgets.

What about for colleges?

Moving to PPY is one of several changes on the horizon that could make it even
more difficult for colleges to predict enrollment. Some admissions and aid
professionals also expect that going out with earlier aid awards will result in
a longer season of families' trying to bargain for more aid - whether the
college thinks they need it or not.

Will this mean more work for financial-aid offices?

The amount of work probably won't change, says Eileen O'Leary, director of
student financial assistance and assistant vice president for finance at
Stonehill College, but the kind of work will. Presumably, the fact that more
Fafsas will be completed with real tax data from the IRS could reduce the need
for colleges to verify the information on the applications, though aid offices
are still waiting for official word on that.

If they do in fact get to spend less time correcting students' data, aid
administrators could spend more time helping students with unusual circumstances
and providing counseling - the type of work most would rather be doing.

UNIVERSAL ACCESS TO AIDS TREATMENT, PREVENTION AND CARE

LENGTH: 1690  words

DATELINE: Sri Lanka


Sri Lanka, Dec. 1 -- Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) has now become a
threat to men, women and children in all parts of the world. Human
Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) causes AIDS. Estimates prepared by the United
Nations indicate that there are 33.4 million people in the world who had been
infected with HIV. Out of this 2.1 million are children. In 2008 2.7 million
people had become newly infected with the virus. As many as 2 million people had
died from AIDS despite recent improvements in access to anti retroviral
treatment. Around half of them had become infected with HIV before reaching the
age of 25 years and they had died before they were 38 years of age.
Approximately ninety per cent of those infected with HIV and AIDS live in lower
and middle income countries. However, HIV is a threat to men, women and children
in all parts of the world.

Declaration of the World AIDS Day

In a bid to tell the world that nothing much had been done to stop AIDS and that
there is much yet to be done December 1 was declared as the World AIDS day in
1988 by the United Nations. An independent organization known as the World AIDS
Campaign (WAC) took over the responsibility of organizing the World AIDS Day.

World AIDS Themes

Since the declaration of December 1 as the World AIDS day in 1988 it was
observed under various themes such as "Communication" (1988), "Youth" (1989),
"women and AIDS" (1990), "Sharing the Challenge"(1991), "Community Commitment"
(1992), "Act" (1993)," AIDS and Family" (1994), "Shared Rights, Shared
Responsibilities"(1995), "One world , one hope"(1996), "Children Living in a
World with AIDS"(1997), "Force for Changed world AIDS" (1998), "Listen, learn,
live. World AIDS Campaign with children and Young people "(1999)"AIDS Men make a
difference (2000) "Sigma and discrimination" (2002 to 2004), "Stop AIDS keep
promise" (2005, 2006, 2007).

"Stop AIDS- Keep Promise" was an appeal to governments, policy makers and
regional health authorities to ensure that they meet many targets that have been
set in the fight against HIV and AIDS and especially the promise of Universal
access to HIV treatment, Care, Support and Prevention Services by this year,
(2010).The campaign ran until now with a related theme chosen for the World AIDS
day each year. The campaign called on not only the governments but also all
sectors of the society such as families, communities and civil society
organizations to make initiative and provide leadership in the struggle to stop
AIDS.

HIV infection in Sri Lanka

The first case of HIV infection in Sri Lanka was reported in 1986 and the
cumulative total reported at the end of 2004 was 614. Of this number 362 were
males and 251 were females. By the end of 2004 the reported number of deaths due
to AIDS was 131. These figures represent only those who had been admitted to
hospitals and hence the numbers of infected persons and the number died are very
likely to be much more. As such the number of persons who had been infected with
HIV during this period is presumably around 3,500.

The spread of the virus in Sri Lanka

It is believed that the heterosexual contact had been the mode of transmission
in more than 85 % of HIV infection. Eleven per cent of the reported HIV
infections were due to homo sexual, bi-sexual transmission. Transmission also
happens from infected mothers to their babies. Since homo-sexual behavior is
illegal intervention targeted at this group is limited. Behavioral factors that
facilitate the spread of the infection are prevalent in Sri Lanka. There is a
large number of sexually active youth between the ages of 15 to 24 and an
increasing number of sex workers in the country.

Overseas migration is another way of transmission. Women employees in factories
in free trade zones, persons seeking foreign employment, workers in the
plantation sector and fishing communities have been identified as other
vulnerable groups. Incidence of infection by injecting drugs is very rare in Sri
Lanka because of precautionary measures such as the screening of the donated
blood in the Central Blood Bank in Colombo and in the blood banks attached to
hospitals in the other parts of the country.

Commercial industry in Sri Lanka

Numbers of women and boys working in the commercial industry in Sri Lanka are
approximately 50,000 and 15,000 respectively. The risk of HIV /AIDS spreading
among sex workers is presumably high due to the low condom use by them and there
is a high prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases which makes a person more
susceptible to contracting HIV/AIDS. A significant number of sex workers are
located near the beach. There are "beach boys" and women who are involved in the
sex trade with tourists.

Sexually transmitted diseases

According to estimation in 1991 about 200,000 cases of sexually transmitted
diseases had occurred annually. Evidently the number should be much more because
the majority of the cases seeking treatment from private practitioners are not
included in the estimate. Presumably only about 15% go for any treatment at
government clinics. HIV prevalence is higher among those who are migrating
within the country and those who are migrating to the middle East and to our
neighbouring country- India. In most cases the occurrence of transmitted
diseases is unavoidable as this migration is necessary for the Economic survival
of many house holders in both rural and urban areas.

Vulnerable cases

Women constitute about 80 % of workers in Free Trade zones. The vulnerability of
these women is indicated by the high rate of unwanted pregnancies and high
prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases. About 1.2 million Sri Lankans work
in the Middle East and 79% of unskilled migrants are women. A large number of
female migrants are reportedly infected with HIV. Further the awareness and
knowledge about HIV/AIDS in less privileged communities is drastically low. For
example only about 40% of the women working in rural tea estates have even heard
of HIV/AIDS. Hence most of them get infected with HIV/AIDS very often without
their knowledge.

Children orphaned by AIDS

Some children are born to parents who had died of HIV infection before they were
grown up. Some of them have lost both parents and there are some who had lost
one of them. Children orphaned by AIDS are therefore defined as people under 18
years of age who are alive and have lost one or both parents having become
infected with HIV/AIDS.

The need to make the general public aware of the ways and means of getting rid
of AIDS

The general public should be made aware of the national response to the call of
the world AIDS Campaign and the action taken at the national level and what is
expected from the people individually and as social groups.

In 1992 the government of Sri Lanka initiated the national AIDS control
programme through which efforts were taken for the prevention and control of
HIV/AIDS. This programme implemented in collaboration with the provincial
directors of Health Services, clinics and the national blood transfusion
service. The national controlling body is the national AIDS Committee. It is a
multi sectarian body comprising different government ministries and institutions
and some key NGOS. Health ministry secretary is the chair person. The National
AIDS Control programme office located within the Ministry of Health functions in
principle as the Executive Secretariat of the NAC. The overall responsibility
rests with the full time programme coordinator.

A national AIDS plan was endorsed by the Ministry of Health in 1994. The
approach was multi sectarian with particular attention for sexually transmitted
diseases. Social sector NGOS play an important role in the campaign.

Two research centres specializing in HIV Law and Ethics for South East Asia
namely the centre for Policy Research and Analysis and the human rights centre
are based at the Colombo University. The Ministries of Education, Planning,
Tourism, Labour and Youth Affairs are the partners of the National Programme.

Attention should however be paid regarding the outcome of the Government
programme. In the first instance reliable data should be collected to make the
policy and the programme management decisions effective and the collection and
dissemination of reliable data is critical for the preparation of a national
programme and its implementation to halt the spread of HIV/AIDS by 2015 in
keeping with the millennium development goals in which Sri Lanka is a signatory.

Difficulty to collect reliable information related to HIV/AIDS

It should be noted that it is extremely difficult to collect reliable
information related to HIV/AIDS because of the fact that those who are affected
very rarely divulge the truth about themselves due to sociological reasons. Very
often those who collect the data have to depend on the information recorded in
government hospitals and other government institutions. As mentioned earlier
many seek medical assistance from private medical institutions and the
information is kept secret.

Organizations which have come forward to wipe out HIV/AIDS

In spite of all such limitations, there are organizations which have come
forward with determination to wipe out HIV/AIDS from the whole world and
especially from our country. Save Lanka Kids plans to go all out to commemorate
World AIDS Day .Rise for Equality, Act for Hope is the first ever National Youth
conference on HIV/AIDS organized by Save Lanka Kids (SLK) to help , educate and
empower youth participants from all parts of the country and makes them change
agents in their respective communities. "Be HIV Positive campaign will be the
highlight of the programme as it will open peoples' eyes literally and
metaphorically) to be Positive about Education, educating each other about HIV/
AIDS. This is to be Positive about Awareness on the AIDS epidemic in their
communities and Positive about support -reaching out to people living with and
affected by HIV/AIDS. Published by HT Syndication with permission from Daily

India to create central foreign aid agency

BYLINE: Nishika Patelguardian.co.uk

ABSTRACT

Nishika Patel: India is to set up a new central agency to manage foreign aid in
a bid to curb corruption and prevents delays in aid delivery

FULL TEXT

India is to set up a central foreign aid agency to prevent funds from being
misused and delays in aid delivery .

India's aid commitments have soared in recent years as the country seeks to
improve its strategic, political and economic clout on the world stage,
especially as China extends its hand.

The agency will reportedly be called the Indian Agency for Partnership in
Development, overseeing $11.3bn (Rs 50,000 crore) over the next five to seven
years.

The move has been welcomed by policymakers who say a central agency will halt
leakages, curb delays, slash operation costs and prevent projects being rushed
through by individuals misusing their discretionary powers. Furthermore, aid
would no longer be driven by territorial divisions and regional interests,
making way for a cohesive aid strategy.

Rajiv Sharma, secretary general of the  (FICCI) said: "The creation of an aid
agency is a recognition by the Indian establishment that India has arrived as a
global player with strategic interests. In the past we have ducked this issue
because we were one of the largest recipients of aid."

Gopalaswami Parthasarathy, a former diplomat and member of the  said an agency
is urgently needed, as one person currently handles aid to Bangladesh, Sri
Lanka, Maldives and Burma. "How can you have one joint secretary to deal with
aid to some of our biggest recipients? He would have political and diplomatic
work to conduct too," he said.

The agency will have to ensure quick decision-making and insulate aid from
political considerations if it is to deliver aid effectively. Experts say that
India's legal framework monitoring government procurement should be strengthened
to boost accountability and to prevent it from falling prey to corruption.

The concerns over aid management are timely. Earlier this year, the government
auditor revealed that $22.6bn (Rs 1 lakh crore) in  due to poor planning by
various ministries.

The creation of the aid agency, believed to be modelled on the US international
development agency, , raises the question of whether India should be dishing out
aid at all when it still receives international aid and suffers from rampant
poverty and poor development. But supporters of India's foreign aid programme
say aid helps the country's domestic agenda indirectly by opening economic
doors, ensuring regional peace and boosting business opportunities in recipient
countries.

Gurpreet Bhatia of the  said: "Aid will pacify India's neighbours and change
their perception about us, sending out a message that we are here to help and
protect them."

Aid has already helped foster India's interests in countries such as
Afghanistan, Bangladesh and some African countries including Somalia and
Ethopia. Pakistan and India have long been jostling for influence in
Afghanistan, and, in May 2011, India pledged $500m to Afghanistan in addition to
its existing commitment of $1.5bn, acquiring considerable goodwill. Also in May
this year,  to reach its development goals, following an injection of $5.4bn in
2008 for infrastructure development. Africa provides widescale business
opportunities to India as well as China, which is also vying for a slice of the
continent's economic resources. In January 2010, India announced a $1bn line of
credit for Bangladesh, the highest one-off amount to any country from India as a
reward for its co-operation in dealing with terrorism and insurgency.

AIDS New Brunswick, the Global Network of People living with HIV/AIDS - North
America (GNP NA) and St. Thomas University hosted the 27th annual International
AIDS Candlelight Memorial on May 27 at the STU chapel, followed by a reception.

James Lord-Edwards, president of AIDS New Brunswick, said the AIDS Candlelight
Memorial is an open community event held to remember, honour and celebrate the
people who have died of AIDS-related illnesses and provides an opportunity to
support and encourage all people living with and/or affected by HIV/AIDS.

The evening's program included guest speaker Claudia St-Pierre, who provided a
mother's perspective on the loss of a child to HIV/AIDS, a spiritual message
from Father Donald Savoie, a lighting of the candles ceremony and Deanna Dugas
shared her personal journey living with HIV/AIDS.

The candle lighting has many functions during the memorial. It serves as a
symbol of hope for the future and represents the awakening on an individual and
community level to education and awareness about HIV/AIDS.

Ted Gaudet, national co-ordinator of the memorial program and one of the
organizers, spoke on the epidemic on a provincial, national and international
level, pointing out that nearly 60,000 Canadians are living with HIV/AIDS and
that 2,500 new infections occur annually in Canada. Globally, 25 million people
have died from AIDS-related illnesses since 1983.

In his closing remarks, Nick Scott, executive director of AIDS New Brunswick,
said that the memorial also serves to raise general public awareness and serves
as a call to action in the continuing fight to end HIV/AIDS and to challenge the
stigma and discrimination associated with HIV/AIDS in our own and other
communities locally, nationally and globally.

The International AIDS Candlelight Memorial was established by the Global Health
Council in 1983 to honour the memory of those lost to HIV/AIDS, show support for
those living with HIV/AIDS, raise awareness of HIV/AIDS and mobilize community
involvement in the fight against HIV/AIDS.

A 2-Year-College System Streamlines Student Aid So Campuses Can Focus on
Counseling

BYLINE: BECKIE SUPIANO

LENGTH: 1207 words


Financial aid can go a long way toward meeting the cost of attending community
colleges, but it is notoriously difficult to get students to apply. The
Connecticut Community Colleges system has hit on a process that helps.

About a decade ago, the system created a centralized student-aid office to cut
down on bureaucratic tasks at its 12 campuses and free up their staffs to work
more with students. Since that change in the 2000-1 academic year, the system
has seen the number of students applying for aid more than double, at a time
when enrollment has grown about 25 percent. And at least one other state system
is considering the model.

Marc S. Herzog, the Connecticut system's chancellor, saw an opportunity to
create the central aid office when the system moved its data onto SunGard Higher
Education's Banner software. At the time, each college's financial-aid staff was
responsible not only for packaging and distributing student aid, but also for
keeping up with regulations and policy changes, verifying student financial
information, and handling audits. A typical office at one of the system's
colleges had a financial-aid director, two other aid professionals, and
work-study employees. And in an increasingly technology-dependent field, some of
them were still pushing paper. "You are asking these offices to do an incredible
amount of work," Mr. Herzog says.

So Mr. Herzog, himself a former student-aid director, created a bureau in the
system office that took many of those routine tasks out of the individual aid
offices. He could do that because the system decided to run the software
centrally, rather than on each campus. The decision saved the system in
licensing fees, but more importantly, prevented it from having to hire 12
associate directors in charge of technology on the campuses, says Tom Bradham,
director of financial-aid services for the system.

The bureau, staffed by three student-aid and two information-technology workers,
provides support to the colleges' aid offices. Mr. Herzog estimates that the
staff members' salaries run about half-a-million dollars a year. If the system
hadn't created a central aid office, Mr. Herzog says, it would have had to add,
conservatively, two or three staff members per campus to handle student aid
under the new data system. He estimates that those salaries would have cost
about $2.4-million a year.

The service bureau handles all the upgrades and technical issues for the
student-aid aspects of the data system. It ensures compliance with federal and
state regulations and handles government audits. The bureau automatically
uploads student-aid applications into the software each night and sends the aid
offices the files they need in the morning. And its staff provides an
easy-to-reach resource for policy and technical questions.

The new data system allowed the colleges to automate some routine tasks, says
David J. Welsh, director of financial-aid services at Tunxis Community College.
This, he says, "leaves us more time to deal with real problems" like helping
students understand and take advantage of financial aid.

At a community college, many students are "a bit overwhelmed by the whole
college process," Mr. Welsh says. In many cases, his staff meets with students
in person to help them apply for aid. All of the college's entrance counseling
is done in person. And the staff also does outreach at area high schools. These
tasks are important but time-consuming, and making other parts of the job more
efficient has freed up more time for them.

The increase in staff time devoted to counseling, Mr. Welsh says, is one reason
the system has seen so many more students applying for aid. Since 2000-1, the
system has had a 111-percent increase in the number of students applying for
aid, and a 102-percent increase in students receiving it. In the 2008-9 academic
year, 63 percent of the system's students applied for aid. By comparison, 42.5
percent of all community-college students applied for aid in 2007-8, according
to an analysis by the Institute for College Access & Success of the most recent
data available from the National Postsecondary Student Aid Survey.

Before 2000, "we were very bad in getting students financial aid," says Mr.
Bradham. He was the financial-aid director at one of the system's campuses,
Asnuntuck Community College, from 1977 to 1998, until Mr. Herzog brought him in
to lead the software implementation and then run the service bureau. Back when
he was a financial-aid director, Mr. Bradham says, staff members in some of the
colleges' financial-aid offices still had to type a student's name and Social
Security number on a piece of paper and walk it to another office. And the
workload was tremendous: "At my office, I was director of cooperative education,
career services, and financial aid all at the same time."

The service bureau exists to support student-aid directors, he says. "We've
taken the mundane financial-aid tasks away from them," he says, but "what we
haven't taken away is the judgment. From the system, we have not given $1 of
financial aid to any student." That key task is still done at the campus level.

But the system's board did set some guidelines for packaging aid, changes that
coincided with the creation of the service bureau.

The first priority is covering all students' direct costs: tuition and fees,
books and supplies. Those costs now total $4,200, and the board's policy is to
cover any need a student has up to that amount in grants.

The colleges are also instructed to treat everyone as a full-time student.
Generally, more aid is available to students who attend full time, and the
college wants to make clear the maximum amount each student qualifies for. Doing
so, they think, encourages more students to attend full time -- which makes
students more likely to stay in college, make good grades, and complete a
degree. Students are also given an explanation of full-time status. And the
colleges don't list loans as part of a student's award, although they do award
federally backed loans.

A Possible Model

For Connecticut, the new infrastructure has proved beneficial. "There's no way
we could handle our volume today if we didn't do what we did with our system
office," Mr. Bradham says.

And the service bureau has at least one fan outside of the state. "It's a very
impressive system in a number of ways," says Glenn DuBois, chancellor of
Virginia's community-college system, who went to Connecticut last summer to see
how the colleges' center operates firsthand. "I would say it's liberated them,
really, to do the counseling piece and the recruitment piece."

Mr. DuBois plans to do something similar in his own system. He just finished a
big software project for the system's finances, is currently working on human
resources, and will deal next with financial aid. Virginia uses PeopleSoft much
the way Connecticut uses Banner, so the system should be able to design a
similar center.

Community colleges operate differently in various states, but Mr. Herzog thinks
even those without a state system should find ways to work together to
centralize some of their student-aid functions. In addition to all its other
benefits, it should save some money. And who isn't looking to do that these
days?

Cash donations best way to help world's hungry

BYLINE: Jennifer Clapp

SECTION: INSIGHT; Pg. A11

LENGTH: 837  words


In a world where natural disasters and other emergencies now seem to occur on a
regular basis, food aid is an important form of humanitarian assistance. It
helps to feed those in dire situations and supplements food supplies in food
deficit countries.

But it is important to remember that food aid is also very much a trade issue,
and one that is highly political. Tied food aid -- that is aid tied to donations
of food grown in donor countries -- has gained much attention in recent years
because of its potential to distort trade.

The currently stalled trade talks at the World Trade Organization, which look
set to be re-launched at Davos this week, provide an opportunity to address some
of the longstanding critiques of in-kind food aid. But the main players, the
United States and the European Union, have been at odds over the issue.

From its inception in the 1950s, food aid was conceived as a foreign policy tool
with multiple objectives. By giving food in-kind, donors aimed to benefit both
the donor and the recipient.

But it hasn't been that simple in practice. The impact of food aid over the past
50 years has been uneven. Extensive research has highlighted the persistent
problems with in-kind food aid.

A key problem is that in-kind food aid can distort markets. It can take months
for a food aid shipment to arrive where it is needed. There is a long list of
cases where food aid arrived during the local harvest. When this happens it
depresses prices in the recipient country, which hurts local producers. In-kind
food aid can also displace commercial trade. When given a choice, some food aid
recipients would purchase food within the local economy, or from a country other
than the food aid donor country. Such transactions can get food to where it is
needed more quickly, and minimizes trade distortions.

It is also very costly to deliver food aid in-kind compared with cash donations
to support food purchases. Studies have shown that it costs on average 50 per
cent more to deliver food aid in-kind than it would if cash were provided to
purchase food locally. And in-kind food aid costs one-third more than if it were
purchased from a third country. Cash has the potential to provide more food for
those in need, and ultimately save more lives.

In-kind food aid also limits food choices for those facing food shortages. Food
preferences might include a desire to consume non-genetically modified food.

Food aid shipments to southern Africa in 2002-03, for example, were rejected by
some countries because they contained genetically modified maize. In recent
months, an unapproved variety of genetically modified rice made its way into
food aid shipped to West Africa, sparking concern.

The problems with relying solely on in-kind food aid have been highlighted by a
number of studies by non-government organizations and intergovernmental bodies
alike. Calls have been made for replacing or at least supplementing in-kind food
aid with a cash-based system which would be less market distorting, less costly,
and allow for countries to express food preferences.

The European Union, Australia, and Canada have responded to these critiques.
They have moved over the past decade to reduce in-kind food aid and implement at
least some cash-based food assistance as part of their food aid programs.
Canada, for example, changed its policy in 2005 to allow up to 50 per cent of
its food aid to be purchased in developing countries.

But the United States, by far the world's largest food aid donor, providing over
50 per cent of all food aid, has held onto its in-kind system. Although the Bush
administration suggested last year that the U.S. should also move toward more
cash-based food assistance, the U.S. Congress bowed to heavy pressure from the
grain producers, processors and shippers, to "keep the food in food aid."

In the WTO trade talks, the EU has claimed that in-kind food aid is an unfair
subsidy to U.S. producers, and that it distorts trade. In its view, in-kind food
aid should be disciplined by WTO rules. In the negotiations, the EU has said it
will only reduce its own agricultural subsidies if the U.S. makes major changes
to its food aid system.

The strong position taken by the EU may well be part of its strategy to enhance
its own bargaining position in the trade talks. But if its tactic is successful
in getting the U.S. to change its food aid program to a more cash-based system
which is in line with the other major donors, it would be a step in the right
direction. The academic literature has pointed out the problems with in-kind
food aid for years. The current WTO negotiations may be a unique opportunity to
bring about a change in practice.

Jennifer Clapp is the chair in international governance at the Centre for
International Governance Innovation in Waterloo, and is an associate professor
in the environment and resource studies department at the University of
Waterloo.

Dr. Clapp will deliver a free lecture on food aid tonight, beginning at 7 p.m.,
at CIGI, 57 Erb St. W. in Waterloo.

U.N. Session Begins to Tally The Perils of Being Young

BYLINE:  By SOMINI SENGUPTA

LENGTH: 864 words

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, May 8


"We are street children. We are the children of war. We are the victims and
orphans of H.I.V./AIDS."

So declared the small but unshakeable voice of Gabriela Azurdy Arrieta, a
13-year-old from Bolivia this morning at the opening session of the United
Nations General Assembly Special Session on Children.

It was the first time children were allowed to speak in such august chambers. So
Gabriela, along with Audrey Cheynut, 17, from Monaco, both reciting a message
drafted by a 300-member children's delegation to the meeting, did not squander
the opportunity.

"We want a world fit for children," Gabriela said, her head barely peeking up
from behind the lectern, "because a world fit for us is a world fit for
everyone."

The three-day meeting, the first General Assembly session to be devoted to the
world's youngest citizens, is intended to assess the plight of the world's
children over the last 12 years, when the United Nations first set concrete
goals to improve children's lives.

The record spoke for itself: Some gains had been made in health and education,
but 10 million children still die every year from preventable diseases and 120
million are not in school. Such a record prompted the secretary general, Kofi
Annan, to reproach his peers.

"To the adults in this room, I would say: Let us not make children pay for our
failures any more," he said in the opening remarks this morning to heads of
state and children from more than 180 countries. "We the grown-ups must reverse
this list of failures."

The conference is to produce a new list of goals for 2015 on everything from
protecting children from war to caring for those orphaned by AIDS to offering
children simple life-saving tools like measles shots. It drew 60 heads of state,
3,000 members of non-governmental organizations and hundreds of children.

But if the halls of the United Nations were awash with pledges about uplifting
children, they were also riven with significant debates over their rights and
desires.

Members of the United States delegation, noting their disappointment with the
draft conference document, said today they would ask for abstinence to be
included as part of the sexual education portion of the document.

"As President Bush has said, abstinence is the only sure way of avoiding
sexually transmitted disease, premature pregnancy and the social and personal
difficulties attendant to nonmarital sexual activity," Tommy G. Thompson, the
Bush Administration's Secretary of Health and Human Services and the head of the
United States delegation, told the General Assembly.

"Our efforts include strengthening close parent-child relationships, encouraging
the delay of sexual activity, and supporting abstinence education programs."

At a briefing with reporters later in the day, members of the United States
delegation said they were also concerned that, among other things, the
conference document did not include sufficiently strong language on protecting
children under 18 from prostitution and pornography.

Disappointment aside, members of the American delegation said, this conference
is nothing like the Conference on Racism in Durban, where the United States
walked out. They said they were optimistic about reaching a consensus.

Conference documents, particularly on children's issues, are usually reached by
consensus, rather than by a vote. The United States, like any other member
nation, has the option of spelling out its reservations on specific provisions
but accepting the conference document as a whole.

The American delegation has also urged that references to the phrase
"reproductive health services" clearly exclude abortion. An American official
contended that delegates from other countries had agreed privately that the
phrase did not refer to abortion, but that they had not yet agreed to spell it
out.

The question of how to handle abortion is a constant thorn on the side of United
Nations conferences. Because "reproductive health services" can mean different
things in different countries -- in some countries, abortion is part of the menu
of options; in other countries it is illegal -- previous United Nations
conferences sidestepped the dispute by leaving it to individual nations.

Many other countries, including most of Europe, want to leave it that way. "It
should be up to countries if and to what extent abortion should feature as an
element within the constellation of reproductive health services," said a member
of a delegation from a European country; he did not want to be named for fear of
jeopardizing the negotiations.

The other sticking point for the American delegation is the degree to which the
conference document can refer to a landmark 1989 treaty on children's rights.
Along with Somalia, the United States is the only country that has not ratified
the so-called Convention on the Rights of the Child. The treaty prohibits
countries from using the death penalty against criminals under age 18, a
practice permitted in many American states.

The treaty spells out a host of political, economic and cultural rights of
children, and many children's advocates here said they hoped it would be the
standard on which this conference document would be based.

MINORITY COALITION TARGETS 'AIDS RIDE'< A BOYCOTT WAS URGED. PHILADELPHIA
GROUPS, ALLEGING RACISM,< SAY THEY HAVE BEEN CUT OUT OF THE FUND-RAISER.

BYLINE: Huntly Collins, INQUIRER STAFF WRITER

SECTION: CITY & REGION; Pg. B01

LENGTH: 1022 words


A long-simmering dispute involving allegations of racism has threatened to
disrupt a Philadelphia-to-Washington, D.C., bike ride aimed at raising $5
million for six AIDS groups in both cities.

The controversy, within Philadelphia's AIDS community, involves a power struggle
over which AIDS groups will share in proceeds from the June 21-23 ride.

A coalition of some AIDS groups headed by minorities maintains that it has been
cut out of the fund-raiser by white-run AIDS groups. The coalition, which has
scheduled a news conference for tomorrow, has called for a boycott of the ride.

Underlying the boycott is an argument made by minority-headed groups that they
can more effectively fight the city's AIDS epidemic, which is concentrated among
African Americans and Latinos, than AIDS groups run by white people.

However, the AIDS organizations being challenged say that most of their clients
are African Americans and Latinos. Furthermore, they say their boards and staffs
include members of minority groups.

Such race-related bickering is nothing new to the city's AIDS service groups,
most of them private, nonprofit organizations.

But a recent loss of $1.8 million in federal funds to fight AIDS in Philadelphia
has helped bring the fight to a head as the groups compete for both public and
private dollars.

"We've never had anything like this happen to us in any other city," said Dan
Pallotta, the president of Pallotta & Associates, a Los Angeles consulting firm
that is organizing the "AIDS Ride."

The for-profit firm has run AIDS Rides in San Francisco, New York, Chicago and
Boston. They are elaborate productions with catered meals, massage therapists
and live stage entertainment at night.

For its work, the firm commands 40 percent of the proceeds - a slice that
critics contend is too large.

Controversy about the local ride erupted this week when the Minority AIDS
Coalition of Philadelphia and Vicinity called for the boycott. The coalition is
the advocacy arm of the Minority AIDS Project, an umbrella group of about 30
minority-led AIDS service providers.

The coalition has also asked people to boycott Tanqueray, the top-shelf English
gin that is corporate sponsor of the ride.

Coalition leaders, who yesterday put out a flier titled "Stop the Ride! The AIDS
Ride is Racist!" have also threatened a "die-in" at the Civic Center, where the
ride will begin.

James Roberts, the executive director of the Minority AIDS Project, said ride
organizers had refused to let his groups share in the proceeds.

He called that decision racist and contended that the four local AIDS groups to
benefit from the ride were taking advantage of the AIDS epidemic among
minorities to "enrich" themselves.

Bike ride beneficiaries strongly disputed the allegations.

Ennes Littrell, the executive director of ActionAIDS and spokeswoman for the
four groups, called Roberts' allegations "disgusting."

"I don't see anyone sitting around thinking about enriching their organization
unless it is the Minority AIDS Coalition thinking about their own organizations
being enriched," she said.

Besides ActionAIDS, the other Philadelphia groups to benefit from the ride are
Philadelphia Community Health Alternatives, the AIDS Information Network and
From All Walks of Life.

From All Walks of Life, which runs the city's annual "AIDS Walk," plans to
distribute its share of the proceeds to its 60 beneficiary organizations,
including some of the groups planning the boycott.

The three other groups to benefit from the ride provide a wide range of AIDS
services - counseling and testing for the AIDS virus, access to medical care and
social services, food banks and AIDS prevention.

But Roberts and other minority critics contend that having white-run groups
fight the AIDS epidemic among minorities was like having a male-run group
working on women's issues.

Roberts said he had been rebuffed by both Pallotta and the four local
beneficiaries. "We want to be a full and equal sponsor," he said.

The four local AIDS groups said Pallotta decided who was to benefit from the
AIDS Ride.

Pallotta said Roberts approached him too late to be included in the bike ride,
which has been in the planning since the summer.

"I invite James Roberts to call me and for us to design an event that taps
specifically into the power of the African American community," Pallotta said.

He said he selected ActionAIDS and the other local groups because of their track
record in providing AIDS services. He said he was impressed by the fact that the
clients of those groups were mostly racial minorities, which reflected
Philadelphia's AIDS epidemic.

"We were not sensitive at that point as to whether an organization was African
American-run or not," Pallotta said.

He said Tanqueray, in exchange for getting its logo on T-shirts and other bike
ride items, had agreed to put $100,000 into the event.

Schieffelin & Somerset Co., the New York company that distributes the imported
gin, could not be reached for comment yesterday.

Pallotta rebuffed criticism from Roberts and others that his consulting firm
would take too large a bite of bike ride proceeds. "We organize the event from A
to Z," he said.

His company, which has 160 employees, handles all the marketing, advertising and
logistics of the ride, Pallotta said. He said about 20 percent of the gross
proceeds go for fund-raising and administrative costs, and 20 percent go to
rider support such as mobile showers, kitchens and medical support.

So far, 965 people have registered for the AIDS Ride, according to Pallotta's
firm. Each person who rides pledges a minimum of $1,400.

Two AIDS groups in Washington - the Whitman-Walker Clinic and Food & Friends -
are also to get part of the proceeds.

Currently, the Minority AIDS Project receives $670,000 in government grants.
Among the groups involved in the ride, ActionAIDS gets $1.3 million in
government money; Philadelphia Community Health Alternatives, $366,000; and the
AIDS Information Network, $470,000, according to the city Health Department.

U.S. Surgeon General Antonia Novello released an AIDS report Thursday that

includes a new focus on the dangers AIDS poses for women and, for the first

time, explicit instructions on using condoms.

The report, aimed at educating Americans about AIDS risks and prevention

methods, documents a rise in the heterosexual spread of AIDS in the United

States. It notes that in 1992, 39 percent of reported AIDS cases in women were
attributable to heterosexual contact, an increase of 42 percent since 1990.

It warns women that AIDS can be passed to infants through breast milk, and
advises infected women to use infant formula. It provides precise directions

on how to wash needles and syringes to avoid spreading AIDS through shared

needles.

"It's done in a way that's non-judgmental, just factual," Novello said

in an interview. Work on the Surgeon General's Report on AIDS began in 1991,

but it languished under the Bush administration, she said.

The Clinton administration and Health and Human Services Secretary Donna

Shalala made the report a priority, Novello said.

"Secretary Shalala said, `I understand there is an AIDS report. Where is

it? Let's get it out,' " Novello said. The 26-page report was released at a

news conference at the Ninth International Conference on AIDS.

It will be distributed to the American public through state and public

health agencies and community groups.

Its release comes at a time when the Clinton administration is under fire from
AIDS activists for failing to honor a campaign promise to appoint an AIDS "czar"
to oversee federal AIDS research and public health programs.

The report includes scientific information and recommendations to prevent the
spread of AIDS.

Novello said a key point is the report's warning that spermicides and

other forms of birth control do not protect against AIDS.

"A latex condom, when used correctly and consistently, offers the best

protection against HIV," the report says. Human immunodeficiency virus, or

HIV, is the virus that causes AIDS.

The report also underscores the dangers AIDS poses to women, children and
teenagers, Novello said.

"Between 1990 and 1991, cases reported among women increased 17 percent,

while cases in men increased only 4 percent," she said.

When AIDS was first identified, it was infecting 11 men for every woman.

That ratio has dropped to 8-1, Novello said.

"Among teenagers with AIDS, the (male-female) ratio is less than three to one,"
she said.

Cases of AIDS attributed to heterosexual transmission of HIV have more

than doubled since 1989 among men and women, she said. AIDS is also spreading to
rural areas, she said.

By the end of 1992, 253,448 cases of AIDS had been reported in the United
States, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Who will pay cost of AIDS? // Nearly everyone will bear part of growing burden

BYLINE: BOB PORT

SECTION: NATIONAL; Pg. 1A

LENGTH: 2564 words



The names in this story are real. But in the interest of privacy, only    the
first names of the people with AIDS have been used.



    Every day, Alan drives to Tampa General Hospital for six hours of
intravenous drug treatment. He has AIDS. In five months, he has run up    $
17,000 in medical costs, even as an outpatient.

     Alan has no health insurance and quickly reached the $ 1,000 limit    on
outpatient care set by the government Medicaid program. Since then,    the
hospital has been absorbing the costs. It will try to make up the    money from
a government donation or from its other, paying patients.

     "I need this treatment," said Alan, 34. "I really don't know    what would
happen if they refused."



    Another AIDS patient, also named Alan, is a middle-level manager at    a
Pinellas County electronics firm, where he is covered by an employee    health
plan. Even now, his treatment costs $ 174 per month, and those    bills are
virtually certain to increase as the disease progresses.

     The group insurance plan, and ultimately the other employees    covered,
pay 80 percent of the costs. "A few hundred dollars when you    have this
disease is nothing," explained Alan. "You go through that    in the first week."




    Besides the human suffering caused by AIDS, or acquired immune    deficiency
syndrome, it is clear that the disease is bringing steadily    increasing costs
that everyone will have to pay. Taxes and medical    insurance premiums are the
only sources of money to treat this disease.

 And most people pay both.

     Even if you don't know anyone with AIDS, even if your family and    circle
of friends escapes the widening circle of victims, you will    still feel the
effects of AIDS in your wallet.

     By a conservative estimate, the United States will be spending    $
4-billion a year on medical care for AIDS patients by the early 1990s.

 That's about what the government has been spending on space flight,
including the shuttle.

     All that for an epidemic that did not exist 15 years ago, an    epidemic
that is adding, in geometrically increasing numbers, mostly    young names to
the list of those who get sick and die.

     The costs, while increasing, can be managed. Even with the worst
predictions, more than 90 percent of Americans who die through the    1990s will
die of something other than AIDS.

     Still, AIDS in four to five years will be surpassed only by heart
disease, cancer and strokes as a cause of death. It will surpass    diabetes,
suicide, and all accidents as a cause of death.

     Dr. Lois Nixon, a professor at the University of South Florida    College
of Medicine and a member of the Hillsborough County Hospital    Authority,
summed it up: "What we have is a sort of catastrophe in    slow motion. It's
going to be a test of all of us."

     It is impossible to be precise about AIDS' financial effects, but:
An industry study predicts life and health insurance claims from    AIDS in the
United States will rise from $ 296-million last year to    $ 3.2-billion by 1995
- a tenfold increase - and about $ 8-billion in    2000. Blue Cross/Blue Shield
of Florida vice president Judy Discenza    said AIDS accounts for about $ 3 per
thousand of the price for her    company's group health coverage. By the early
'90s that could go to $ 25    per thousand, she said.

     One recent study by life insurance actuaries predicts that    companies may
have to increase premiums on new policies by as much as    11 percent to
compensate for early claims they didn't anticipate.

     Insurance, however, covers less than half the costs of AIDS    treatment.
Medical costs for the typical AIDS patient now run about    $ 80,000. About 40
percent of that cost for AIDS patients in Florida is    paid by Medicaid, a
state and federal program. Last year, that bill    came to $ 21-million and is
predicted to reach $ 200-million by 1992.

 That's an amount roughly equal to the cost of St. Petersburg's    redevelopment
plan for a downtown shopping district.

     When AIDS patients exhaust their Medicaid coverage, what's left is
charity. But charity isn't free; it's provided by public hospitals,    like
Tampa General, which are supported by more tax dollars.

     The money to treat AIDS patients has "got to come from    somewhere," said
Warren Greenberg, a Howard University professor who    has studied insurance
premiums and AIDS. "There's no free lunch in    this. It's got to come from
somewhere ... the government or insurance    firms."

 The toll

   With every reason to be worried, insurance executives recently    completed
their first assessment of AIDS cases and their likely effect    on insurance
claims in the United States through 1999.

     The report was prepared by actuaries from the industry's two major    trade
groups, the American Council of Life Insurance and the Health    Insurance
Association of America. A copy was obtained by the St.    Petersburg Times.

     Like many such studies, it looks at three scenarios: worst case,    best
case and something in between. It has caveats: It does not    contemplate new
drugs that may treat AIDS, nor does it envision that    AIDS will spread widely
among heterosexuals.

     Even under the most optimistic scenario, AIDS deaths would peak in    1995
at 58,000 per year. The most pessimistic scenario forecasts a    continually
growing death toll through the turn of the century, with    168,000 dying in the
year 2000.

     The middle scenario assumes that the virus can hide in the body for    10
years before breaking out into the disease. That scenario predicts    more than
50,000 deaths in 1992. The death toll would peak in 1999 with    more than
86,000 deaths annually.

     Based on such projections, deaths from AIDS will easily surpass    leukemia
deaths this year, and probably will surpass deaths from breast    cancer within
two to four years.

     For the Tampa Bay area, which has accounted for just under 1    percent of
AIDS cases nationally, the middle scenario would mean more    than 500 AIDS
deaths annually in just three years. By 1999, AIDS would    kill more than 800
people a year. That's two or three AIDS funerals    every day.

     The effects of AIDS are pronounced in the Tampa Bay area because    people
who get the disease somewhere else may come here for treatment    or to be near
their families.

     Donald, for example, had a successful wholesale cookies and cakes
business in New York City when he started showing signs of infection    with the
AIDS virus. After he tested positive, he sold his business and    moved here,
for the weather and to be near a relative, he said.

     Now, Donald has applied for Social Security disability income and
Medicaid here. "Where are you going to find a job?" he asked.

     Although Florida consistently has ranked third among states for new
diagnoses of AIDS cases, the Sunshine State has for the past two years    been
No. 1 as the source of AIDS-related life insurance claims.

     Life insurance companies paid just under $ 2-million on 337 AIDS    cases
from Florida in 1988, more than the combined claims from    California and New
York, according to a survey of 33 large life    insurance carriers.

     "People are coming here to die," said Miriam Gray, a nurse
epidemiologist at Morton Plant Hospital in Clearwater. She noted that    Morton
Plant has seen AIDS patients from New York and Michigan.

 Insurance

   David, of Tampa, knew he was infected with the AIDS virus last year    when
he noticed an insurance offer with his monthly Citicorp MasterCard    statement.

 The policy would pay him $ 75 a day while he was in the    hospital. The
application didn't ask about AIDS infection. He took the    coverage. It made a
nice addition to health insurance he acquired    through a former job.

     Later, David was diagnosed as having AIDS itself. He pays his    premiums.
Like other AIDS patients who have insurance, he expects the    insurance company
to pay.

 The costs

   As the disease progresses, AIDS patients may be in and out of the    hospital
several times. The cost of a typical two-week stay can exceed    $ 12,000. AZT,
a drug that can slow down but not cure AIDS, can cost    $ 800 a month.

     So far, AIDS costs aren't noticeable in insurance premiums. A    survey of
insurers last year found that AIDS accounted for only 0.6    percent of health
claims and 1.4 percent of life claims.

     Those figures seem sure to grow. The same insurance study    predicting
AIDS deaths also predicts insurance claims. The study    doesn't attempt to
predict the effect on premiums.      "AIDS has the potential, in the absence of
effective    countermeasures, to have a very significant adverse effect on life
and    health insurance companies in the next decade," the report says. "All
of the projections indicate a very significant increase in the level of    life
and health claims due to AIDS."

     The report advises insurers to cut costs or raise rates if they    have
"experienced a rapid growth in business," particularly in urban    areas.

     Finally, the report warns that AIDS could reverse a long downward    trend
in the price of life insurance, and cause a "significant    increase" in health
insurance prices. "The insurance industry has the    wherewithal to manage the
financial impact of AIDS, as long as future    experience is not materially
worse than our projections indicate."

     The biggest increases in claims costs is projected for group health
policies late in the 1990s. "An undetermined but very large share of    this
cost is going to be passed right on to the employers," said    Charles Eby, a
public policy analyst with the Health Insurance    Association of America.

     Most insurers have not begun to seriously predict the impact of    AIDS
beyond the next few years, when by any measure the impact is still    small. "We
haven't focused at all on what actions we will take," said    Discenza of Blue
Cross/Blue Shield of Florida. "That isn't to say that    we're not thinking
about it and worried about it."

     Insurers could try to avoid AIDS-related price increases by    limiting
their coverage. For instance, companies might refuse to sell    policies in some
cities, Discenza said. Still, recent mortality    predictions suggest that AIDS
could raise many health premiums by    several percentage points within a
decade, she said.

     "Costs of things like this never sound like they are incredibly    high,"
Discenza said, "but it's just one of those little niches that    begins to make
insurance unaffordable."

     Medical tests, or at least insurance application questions about    AIDS,
could become more common prerequisites for insurance. Florida has    allowed
testing since last July, while also prohibiting insurers from    excluding
coverage for AIDS-related claims, once coverage is granted.

     A test for the AIDS virus already is a requirement for anyone    buying a
lot of life insurance.

     "I would say without a doubt now that most companies will test for    $
100,000 and over," said Douglas Breitenbach, a lobbyist for the    American
Council of Life Insurance. Some companies are starting to    require testing at
$ 50,000, he said.

 Medicaid and charity

   Sharon, a waitress in her 30s, gave up working at a Pinellas County
restaurant last month. Her AIDS case was worsening. She had never    needed
disability pay or Medicaid before, but without insurance, she    needs all she
can get.

     Last month, she waited in line to apply. "I came home and I cried    all
day long," she said.

     Medicaid is the single biggest source of money for treatment of    AIDS
patients.

     In Florida, Medicaid is available to adults who are poor or    impoverished
by large medical bills, or who are declared disabled by    the Social Security
Administration. There are AIDS patients in both    categories. Medicaid is
financed 45 percent by the state and 55 percent    by the federal government.

     Right now, Medicaid spending on AIDS is a problem that politicians    can
ignore because the number of patients is relatively small - 755 as    of last
October. But state officials predict their spending on    AIDS-related care will
increase tenfold in three years. By 1992,    Medicaid will have to support more
than 8,600 AIDS patients. That's    when the predictions end, and five-digit
numbers of AIDS patients will    begin.

     Nationwide surveys suggest that teaching hospitals and public    hospitals
like Tampa General are likely to see more than their share of    AIDS patients.
Hospitals rely on the state to provide reasonable    payments for needy
patients. Unfortunately, Medicaid sometimes doesn't    meet the needs of AIDS
-infected patients.

     A typical AIDS patient in the Tampa Bay area moves in and out of    the
hospital and sometimes needs special equipment at home. In Florida,    Medicaid
won't pay for more than 45 hospital days a year or more than    $ 150 in durable
medical supplies, like home IV equipment.

     Melinda Bridges, a Tampa General social worker, recalls one AIDS    patient
who could not walk but who was ready to go home. Medicaid's    $ 150 wouldn't
pay for a wheelchair. The patient was stuck in Tampa    General, where the
hospital Medicaid charge today is $ 679 a day.

     "It took a lot of phone calls to find some way to pay for it, but    that's
what it always seems to come down to - money," Bridges said.

     Tampa General, the No. 3 hospital in Florida for Medicaid claims,    has
seen steadily increasing numbers of AIDS patients since 1986. As of    March,
the hospital had issued bills totaling $ 5.9-million involving    5,350 hospital
days for AIDS patients.

     Only $ 3.3-million was covered by Medicaid, insurance, county taxes    or
other sources. That leaves $ 2.5-million in unreimbursed care.

 Records show that most of the unpaid bills can be traced to    tax-supported
patients, mostly Medicaid patients.

     Who pays when Medicaid or insurance won't pay?

     "I would say, ultimately, it's going to be the taxpayers of    Hillsborough
County," said Rochelle Moore, a vice president for    finance at Tampa General.
As a public hospital, Tampa General turns to    its home county to pay for
indigent care.

     "Ultimately," Moore continued, "it's going to be the hospitals    that are
hit with the cost of AIDS ... and all of us."

Experimental AIDS drugs to be tested on humans

BYLINE: By Kelly Toughill Toronto Star

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A32

LENGTH: 558 words


   Testing of five new experimental AIDS drugs has been approved by federal
officials.

Details have not been worked out, but Dr. Alastair Clayton, director of the
Federal Centre for AIDS, said he expects some of the tests on humans may start
in a couple of months.

"No one knows what they will turn up, or if any of them will work," he said in
an interview yesterday.

How long the drugs are tested, and whether they are eventually approved for use
on all AIDS patients, will depend on how well they work in human trials, he
said.

Ribavirin, dextran sulphate, EL10, trimetrexate and fluconazole are the new
drugs. They join three other anti-AIDS remedies being tested in Canada: AT,
interferon and aerosolized pentamidine.

The announcement of the tests was hailed by AIDS activists, many of whom have
criticized the federal government for failing to sponsor more trials of
promising anti-AIDS drugs.

'Very good news'

"It's wonderful, absolutely wonderful," said Jeff Braff, chairman of the
Canadian AIDS Society, an umbrella group for 30 AIDS organizations.

"It's very good news," added George Smith, of AIDS Action Now.

Smith's group staged a rowdy protest last spring to voice its frustration over
the lack of experimental drugs available to people with AIDS in Canada.

Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that destroys the
body's immune system, leaving people vulnerable to other, often fatal
infections.

The virus is found in body fluids such as blood and semen and is most commonly
spread during sex, the sharing of needles by infected drug users and from
pregnant mother to child.

As of yesterday, 1,983 cases of AIDS had been reported in Canada from the first
case. Of these, 880 are alive, 1,103 have died.

In the United States, dozens of drugs are being tested on people with AIDS, yet
fewer than half a dozen have been tried so far in Canada.

Last spring federal officials blocked the sale of dextran sulphate when they
learned the drug's Scarborough manufacturers planned to market it as a food
supplement to help fight the AIDS virus.

Clayton pointed out that Canada has relatively few people with AIDS, therefore
manufacturers are less interested in sponsoring trials of their drugs here than
in the United States, where there are 31,000 people with AIDS.

Dextran sulphate and EL10 will be the first drugs tested, said Clayton. Both
have been shown to kill the AIDS virus in laboratory tests.

Ribavirin is an anti-viral drug effective in treating some types of tropical
fevers caused by virus.

Trimetrexate is an anti-fungal drug that will be tested for its ability to treat
a form of thrush, a disease in which blisters form in the mouth and throat.
Thrush often plagues people with AIDS.

Fluconazole will be tested to see if it can control a form of pneumonia that is
the most common form of AIDS.

CORRECTION

A report Wednesday on experimental drugs approved for testing in the fight
against AIDS incorrectly reversed the nature and roles of two of the drugs -
trimextrate and fluconazole. Trimextrate is a drug effective against a type of
pneumonia most common to AIDS patients. Fluconazole is an anti-fungal agent to
be tested against a mouth and throat disease.

AIDS workers A roller coaster of emotions

BYLINE: By Virginia Corner Toronto Star

SECTION: LIFE; Pg. K1

LENGTH: 1608 words


   It breaks social worker Shirley Reeves' heart to see "the face of AIDS."

Where once there was a vigorous human being, with many of the same hopes and
dreams as she, there is now nothing but a shrunken shell of skin and bones.

Alone in a room with a dying AIDS patient, Reeves may find herself having to
block out the smell and sounds - the incessant sneezing and coughing - of this
"messy, dirty disease."

"No one deserves to die of AIDS," says Reeves, grimacing at the memory of the
men who have come and gone in the four years that she has been working
exclusively with homosexual AIDS patients at St. Michael's Hospital.

"No one deserves to die of any disease, but no one deserves to die of AIDS."

Reeves was "scared" the first time she met someone who had AIDS. Acquired immune
deficiency syndrome is a fatal condition that breaks down the body's immune
system, affecting its natural ability to fight disease. As of Monday, 1,497
cases of AIDS had been reported in Canada. Of these 691 people are alive and 806
have died.

Reeves trusted what the medical profession had to say about not being able to
"catch" AIDS from casual contact but "the fears about the unknown" at that time
were still with her.

Every AIDS worker, from doctors and nurses to social workers and visiting
homemakers, feels the same way at first, says Toronto psychiatrist Dr. Stephen
Woo.

The 30-year-old head of the Clinic for AIDS-Related Concerns at Mount Sinai
Hospital remembers the awful apprehension he felt the first time an AIDS patient
came into his office.

"After he left, I suddenly realized that I was feeling very anxious, and
wondered whether I should wipe the chair down or not," he recalls.

Woo knew he wasn't going to get AIDS from shaking the man's hand or sitting in
the same room with him. (AIDS is spread through certain kinds of sexual contact;
sharing contaminated needles or syringes; transfusion of infected blood or blood
products, and from an infected mother to an infant in the womb.) But his natural
response was still one of cold fear.

Though the fear disappears as experience in dealing with AIDS patients grows,
Woo says many who care for AIDS patients continue to feel "alone and isolated."

"All people working with AIDS . . . have felt the same sort of stigmatization
that people with AIDS themselves have felt," Woo says. "So it becomes easy to
respond in the same way as AIDS patients themselves: feeling put upon, feeling
isolated, feeling somehow excluded."

AIDS workers like Woo say there's still so much ignorance, even among the
medical profession, about how the AIDS virus is spread and so much homophobia -
fear of homosexuals - that it makes their job far tougher.

For example:

* One visiting homemaker interviewed by The Star wouldn't allow her name to be
used because her other clients don't know she works with AIDS patients "and they
might not be too thrilled."

* A nurse at a downtown hospital says she doesn't know of any nurses in the city
who would object to working with AIDS patients, but in the suburbs, where there
are fewer AIDS cases, there's still "a very major fear. They tend to give relief
nurses AIDS patients, because they don't really have much say in what patients
they get."

* A general practitioner refused to examine a woman who had the flu because her
tenant had been exposed to the AIDS virus and the doctor thought "she may have
contracted the virus."

Woo, who has seen 130 AIDS-related cases in the 18 months since Mount Sinai's
clinic opened, says the last story discourages him more than dealing with
somebody with AIDS.

"When I see somebody who's coming in, I feel that I can do something that might
help, that this person is suffering through no fault of their own," Woo says.
"It's a different situation when a colleague, who you would hope would know
better, responds that way."

As a social worker caring for AIDS patients, Reeves strives to be accepting,
non-judgmental, a good listener. And she sees no harm in hugging AIDS patients.

"A person who is sick is entitled to health care," Reeves says. "I don't do
hands-on . . . but I do hug."

Reeves, who sees AIDS patients go back and forth between home and hospital until
they're too weak to move any more, sometimes feels as though she's on ''a roller
coaster ride" and the only way to get away from the stress is to "go fishing or
for long walks."

An AIDS patient will come in and she knows he's going to die; but that might be
three to five years down the road. That's hard on Reeves, too.

"Hopefully, they will sort of recover from whatever the disease is doing right
now," she says. "They will be able to live in the community and carry on to the
best of their ability until it strikes again. In another form, perhaps, or the
same form."

The greatest shock for Reeves is "the wasting process," the huge weight loss
many AIDS patients experience, she says.

"It's like looking at the stories you see of people who are starving. You just
can't imagine.

"One man said to me, 'I looked in the mirror and I was scared to death because I
did not know who was looking back at me.' "

Reeves herself didn't recognize one man who lost 25 pounds. "He is in a
remission stage and is out living in the community," Reeves says. "He has gained
back, maybe, 15 pounds. But he can relapse again. . . . Trying to build the body
up from that wasting process - every pound they put on - is so important."

Reeves usually goes in to see her patients once a day. Sometimes, they want to
talk to her. Sometimes, they don't. They can be in tremendous crises, depressed
about dying, or abandoned by a lover perhaps. In which case, Reeves says, "it's
just a matter of talking about it." Or they may be in a lighter mood. Like the
patient who told her he couldn't wait to get home "to cook up something really
worth eating."

Still on a positive note, Reeves says enough praise can't be given to the nurses
at her hospital, and to Metro's homosexual community, which is rallying behind
AIDS patients and "burying the men with dignity."

Besides battling ignorance, an AIDS worker also has to cope with the pressure of
constantly seeing people die. It's not something one learns in nursing school,
says Diana Speelman.

"It's certainly cause for tear sessions, even before they pass away," says
Speelman, a 24-year-old nurse at Mount Sinai Hospital. She works on the 17th
floor, where there are usually two or three AIDS patients.

Hands-on nursing of AIDS patients - even cleaning up vomit, feces and urine -
isn't risky, Speelman says.

"So long as you're properly protected through gloves, gowns and masks, if
necessary, there's really no risk for you at all."

The real risk, Speelman contends, is emotional. It's what AIDS workers give of
themselves in time and care for the patient that can be really draining; like
sitting and talking in the middle of the night with a lonely AIDS patient.

"We know the expected outcome," she says. "We know they'll die. Then you get
attached, and you know you're going to have to go through the grieving process
with them."

Some of her AIDS patients were "special people" Speelman became close to in the
hospital. When they died, she bemoaned the fact there is no cure for the deadly
disease.

"When you've given that intimate care to them and you've been a part of dealing
with their anger and their frustrations, and you've sat with them . . . or with
a friend when he was really depressed, you become intertwined. Like a family.

"It's not easy . . ."

In order to cope with the deaths, AIDS workers say they have to make an extra
effort to take care of themselves emotionally, through joining a support group
and taking vacations.

"It helps to know that you're not alone, that the same sorts of frustrations
aren't just unique to me," says Woo, referring to the value of a support group.

At his hospital, the AIDS workers survive by being a team. "We turn to each
other for support," he says.

Furthermore, Speelman and the other nurses she works with have an agreement to
call her at home - "just to let me know" - if one of her AIDS patients dies
while she's off-duty.

"I want to know so I have a chance to grieve properly," Speelman says. "If I
can, I try to go to their funerals. Just to have a final farewell."

It goes without saying that AIDS workers can't simply dismiss their patients
from their minds at the end of the day.

"Everyone tries not to bring work home with them, but it's hard if you've been
close to some men," says Reeves. She treasures the many thank-you notes she
receives from friends and relatives of AIDS patients. "It means you've done your
job," she says.

Knowing someone has had a proper funeral can help ease the pain of death, but
that's something Amelia, a 31-year-old employee of the Visiting Homemakers
Association, rarely finds out about.

"I just know I've been reassigned, so I'm assuming they've died," says Amelia,
who asked that her real name not be used.

Her own mother doesn't know she goes into AIDS patients' homes, usually twice a
week for up to four hours a day, and she's afraid to tell her because "I don't
know how she'd take it."

Amelia earns $6.35 an hour, helping AIDS patients with housekeeping and grocery
shopping, and talking to them, because "one or two of them have been really
depressed."

"I know AIDS isn't contagious, and I know they're short of homemakers, so why
not?" she says.

Moreover, Amelia has a selfish reason for doing her job: Her own brother-in-law
is a homosexual.

"You never know, I may be facing that (AIDS) in my own family soon."

Lawyers dissatisfied with legal aid fee schedules

BYLINE: GAIL LEM; GAM

LENGTH: 1249 words


By  GAIL LEM
   Toronto criminal lawyer Rebecca Shamai takes for granted that half of
 the cases she will work on during her career will be paid for by legal
 aid.

"If I were out to make money, I'm sure I wouldn't be doing what I'm  doing," she
said.

Miss Shamai is one of about 12,000 lawyers across Canada who handled
 roughly 350,000 legal aid cases in the 1979-1980 fiscal year.

Although legal aid plans vary from province to province, the
 participation of the private bar is always voluntary. But Miss Shamai said
 that for her, "and I think that here I can speak on behalf of most
 criminal lawyers, there's not an option.
    "In my own practice, which is 95 per cent criminal work, I do not have
 any quota for legal aid certificates. If you want to practice criminal
 law, your clientele doesn't include very many wealthy people."
    The first official legal aid plan in Canada was enacted by Ontario in
 1967. All provinces and territories now provide legal aid in most criminal
 cases to eligible persons who might be imprisoned or lose their livelihood
 if convicted. Varying amounts of assistance also are given in civil cases.

The principle behind legal aid - that the courts should be accessible
 to everyone, regardless of financial status - is one with which few
 lawyers would argue. But they are upset with fee schedules that lag so far
 behind costs and inflation some lawyers say they lose money when they take
 a legal aid case.

Federal funds are channelled into the plans, but the largest
 contribution comes from the provinces, which have jurisdiction over legal
 aid.

Some plans rely on the participation of the private bar, while others
 mainly use government-salaried lawyers. Some provinces provide a
 combination of the two.

Financial eligibility for legal aid runs the gamut from a means test in
 Alberta, where income is the main criterion, to social assistance
 standards in Prince Edward Island and a needs test in Ontario, which
 considers the financial commitments of the applicant as well as income.

But no matter what the system, legal aid lawyers across Canada face a
 common problem, said James Chadwick, chairman of the legal aid committee
 of the Law Society of Upper Canada.
    "With the recession, all of the provinces have been faced with
 restraint, all of the provinces have been reassessing their social welfare
 programs. And all of the provinces have given legal aid less priority than
 other social programs."
    Robert O'Reilly, director of the National Legal Aid Research Centre in
 Ottawa, established in 1977 to provide information about legal aid and
 research for legal aid services, said lawyers generally "don't do too well
 with legal aid because the fees they get are lower than in private
 practice."
    With the notable exception of Ontario, where legal aid is almost
 exclusively on a fee-for-service basis, most provinces "have revised their
 tariffs within the last two years," Mr. O'Reilly said. "But the tariffs
 are always structured so that they are substantially lower than the normal
 lawyers' fees."
    The Law Society of Upper Canada, which regulates legal aid services in
 Ontario, has requested a 30 per cent increase in the fee schedule this
 year and has asked the provincial Government to review the tariff
 annually. There have been two increases in the rate - 20 per cent in 1973
 and 25 per cent in 1979 - since the plan was established.

But the Ontario attorney-general's office "is looking very closely at
 legal aid expenditures and would like to find ways of cutting costs or at
 least restraining increases in costs," Mr. O'Reilly said.
    "All the legal aid plans are under severe restraint. It has come at a
 time, however, when some people least able to defend themselves find
 themselves in more trouble because of the economy."
    Quebec, for example, proposes a user fee, "one way of both earning some
 income for legal aid and to some extent reducing the demand for service,"
 Mr. O'Reilly said.

Individuals awarded legal aid certificates would have to pay a fee,
 probably between $20 and $40, said Yves Lafontaine, chairman of the
 Commission des services juridiques. Exceptions would be made for persons
 receiving social assistance or who would qualify for social assistance.

In Nova Scotia, all government services are facing restraint and "we
 don't know what the cuts are going to be," said Ross Archibald, chairman
 of the Nova Scotia Legal Aid Commission. Earlier this year, the Nova
 Scotia Government indicated funding would be cut back about 10 per cent,
 he said.

Toronto criminal lawyer Dianne Martin said "there is a real problem
 with making a living on legal aid, there's no doubt about that at all."
    Although she feels "very strongly that I should and must take legal aid
 cases," whether a prospective client's legal fees will be paid by legal
 aid is a factor she has to take into consideration.

Legal aid cases account for 60 to 80 per cent of her cases. "It's
 certainly not 100 per cent. There aren't too many lawyers where it would
 be.
    "Even at my rates, which are quite moderate, no lawyer has a choice but
 to keep an eye on legal aid . . . because you do fall into a rob-Peter-to-
 pay-Paul situation because your better-paying clients subsidize the legal
 aid cases."
    Although successful corporate and tax lawyers are able to command hefty
 incomes generally in excess of $60,000 a year, "the lawyer who is in the
 public mind - the criminal lawyer or family lawyer - is not making that
 kind of money," Dianne Martin said. "And interest rates have creamed
 lawyers as much as anyone else because most of us have been operating on a
 line of credit from our bank because our income is very erratic."
    Legal aid does not allow interim billing, so payment comes in a lump
 sum after the case is over, which could be several months or even a couple
 of years. Meanwhile, lawyers still have to pay their rent and salaries of
 office staff. There also is an ongoing concern that senior, experienced
 lawyers take fewer and fewer legal aid cases, because they are not
 lucrative enough.

Frances Kiteley, a Toronto civil lawyer who specializes in matrimonial
 cases, said junior lawyers fresh out of law school take on a large number
 of legal aid cases "because it's better to do that than starve."
    But Miss Kiteley said she has "reached a point where I'm very careful
 about whether I take on a legal aid certificate, more particularly since
 I'm very aware of what the overhead is. You actually, in my view, lose
 money when you take a legal aid case."
    Miss Kiteley charges private clients $85 an hour and tells them they
 can expect to spend $1,000 a day in court. On a legal aid case, "I can
 charge only $54 an hour, and out of that $54, I have to take out 25 per
 cent, $13.50 an hour, which is supposed to be my contribution to legal
 aid."
    Ontario and New Brunswick require lawyers to contribute to legal aid 25
 per cent of the fees they receive under the plans. "It totally overlooks
 the fact that we're already contributing the difference between $54 and
 $85," Miss Kiteley said.

But the real frustration for lawyers who take on legal aid cases is the
 paperwork the system requires, she said. Every step in the judicial
 process has to be authorized by the legal aid office.

Although she agreed payments drawn from the public purse should be
 monitored, Miss Kiteley said this could be done more efficiently by
 extending to the legal aid system a provision that requires lawyers in
 private practice to justify accounts questioned by clients.

Director of State AIDS Institute Says She Is Resigning in Protest Over Pataki
Policies

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO

SECTION: Section B;  Page 8;  Column 1;  Metropolitan Desk

LENGTH: 670 words

DATELINE: ALBANY, Nov. 22


Denouncing the Pataki administration's AIDS policies, the director of the
state's AIDS Institute said today that she is resigning to protest anticipated
budget cuts that she said would "dismantle H.I.V. care in New York State."

The director, Dr. Nilsa Gutierrez, who has led the agency for the last two
years, said in an interview that aides to Gov. George E. Pataki have told her to
find ways to cut the institute's $180 million budget by up to 20 percent next
year, or about $36 million. In the institute's 12-year history, its budget has
never been cut.

Dr. Gutierrez, who was appointed by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, said that a spending
cut of that magnitude would force the institute to eliminate or reduce state
grants to hospitals and community organizations that provide AIDS treatment and
prevention services.

She also said that Mr. Pataki is strongly considering giving local governments
far greater control over state health and social service spending through the
use of so-called block grants. Such a policy could lead to uneven standards
across the state for AIDS programs and would jeopardize the existing network of
AIDS services that the institute has built over the past decade, she said.

"I will not be an accomplice to a process that dismantles H.I.V. care in New
York State," Dr. Gutierrez said. "I cannot participate, in the face of rising
numbers of people with H.I.V., in a process of finding a rationale to justify
this cut."

Diane Mathis, a spokeswoman for Dr. Barbara A. DeBuono, the State Health
Commissioner, said no final decisions have been made about either budget cuts or
block grants. But Ms. Mathis said Dr. DeBuono believes that there has been a
lack of "fiscal controls" over spending by the AIDS Institute and that its
programs could be run more efficiently.

Referring to Dr. DeBuono, Ms. Mathis said: "She has treated AIDS patients. She
is not going to allow the dismantling of the AIDS program in New York State. And
no way does the Governor want to dismantle the AIDS program. If Dr. Gutierrez is
saying this, she is very misinformed."

Dr. Gutierrez's resignation, which takes effect Dec. 31, comes at a time of
growing friction between the institute, which is a part of the Department of
Health, and Mr. Pataki's inner circle.

In recent months, officials in the institute have been at odds with Mr. Pataki
and his aides over an array of issues, including budget cuts, an AIDS curriculum
for public schools and legislation that would require the state to release
results from H.I.V. tests on newborn babies.

Since September, six high-ranking officials in the institute, not including Dr.
Gutierrez, have been dismissed or transferred to other offices.

The institute, created in 1983 by the Legislature, has 350 employees and is the
largest state agency in the country devoted to developing and managing AIDS
programs and policies. In addition to administering tens of millions of dollars
in state grants, it trains AIDS educators, tracks the spread of H.I.V. and
provides technical expertise to the Health Department in developing AIDS
policies and legislation.

About 28,000 New Yorkers have AIDS, and 125,000 to 253,000 more are infected
with H.I.V., according to state statistics.

Dr. Gutierrez, 42, joined the institute in 1989 and became its medical director
in 1992. She was appointed by Mark Chassin, the former Health Commissioner, to
be director in February 1994 after her predecessor, Dr. Nicholas A. Rango, died
of AIDS,

Dr. Gutierrez said cuts in state AIDS spending next year would come at a
particularly bad time because both Congress and New York City, which has the
majority of the state's AIDS cases, are also talking about curtailing AIDS
services.

She said that if the state disburses AIDS money in block grants to local
governments with few or no strings attached, the state will lose much of its
power to monitor and direct AIDS services. The result, she argued, will be a
patchwork of programs, or worse, no programs at all in some areas.

Sex Is Leading Cause of AIDS in Women

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN

SECTION: Section A; Page 12; Column 4; National Desk

LENGTH: 903 words


For the first time, more women have developed AIDS as a result of heterosexual
intercourse than intravenous drug use, Federal health officials said yesterday,
reporting on figures from 1992.

Nearly 60 percent of those women had been sex partners of men who were
intravenous drug users, and most of the remaining sex partners were bisexual
men.

The number of men and women who have become infected with AIDS through
heterosexual intercourse with members of the opposite sex and who have no risk
factors for AIDS "is very low, but not zero," said Dr. John Ward, an AIDS
official at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. He said
the C.D.C. did not have any numbers for such transmission, but he added that
there was no evidence that the numbers were large.

Until last year, most women diagnosed with AIDS had become infected through
intravenous drug use, the C.D.C. said in its weekly report.

Growing Incidence

As the AIDS epidemic continues into its 13th year, women continue to constitute
a growing proportion of people with AIDS in this country. The number of AIDS
cases among women jumped 9.8 percent in 1992, while the number of cases
involving men rose 2.5 percent. More than half the cases among women were
reported from 10 metropolitan areas, with New York City the leader by far.

The pattern of how AIDS was spread among women varied with the region of the
country. In the Northeast, more women became infected with AIDS as a result of
intravenous drug use. But transmission through heterosexual intercourse was more
frequent among women with AIDS in the South, Midwest, West and the United
States' territories, the Federal agency reported.

The rates of AIDS cases involving women were higher for non-Hispanic blacks and
Hispanics than for non-Hispanic whites.

Overall, in 1992, the number of AIDS cases reported in the United States rose
3.5 percent, to 47,095 from 45,499.

AIDS remains chiefly a disease affecting men who have homosexual sex or who are
intravenous drug users. Last year, 51 percent of the cases of AIDS involved men
who are homosexual or bisexual, the C.D.C. said. Another 29 percent involved men
who used intravenous drugs. The report identified 14.1 percent of the patients
as women.

Early Warning Sign

Dr. Ward said the Federal agency intended its report to be an early warning sign
of the heterosexual AIDS threat. But he said the numbers did not show a sharp
change in the epidemic.

Beyond giving an update on AIDS data, the report is also intended to underscore
the need for a greater emphasis on education to prevent the further spread of
AIDS among heterosexuals, Dr. Ward said. Men and women need to know the sex and
drug histories of their partners before having sex with them, the report said.

Dr. Ward added that since women who become infected with H.I.V., the virus that
causes AIDS, can pass the virus to their babies, the increase in AIDS cases
involving women is even more significant.

Transmission of H.I.V. to infants around the time of birth ranked second, behind
heterosexual spread, as the largest proportionate increase in AIDS cases last
year. The perinatal transmission increase was 13.4 percent; the increase for
heterosexual contact was 17.1 percent.

The trend toward increasing numbers of women and babies with AIDS is expected to
continue in the next several years, and the increasing rates should be a
national concern, Dr. Ward said.

The C.D.C. report said that its categorization of women who became infected with
AIDS through heterosexual sex and intravenous drug use was approximately
correct. In 1992, 10.2 percent of men and 23.5 percent of women who reported
using intravenous drugs also reported having had heterosexual sex with someone
at risk for H.I.V.

In the case of people who have more than one risk factor for AIDS, the Federal
agency classifies the origin of exposure hierarchically, with intravenous drug
use ranked higher than heterosexual sex. So the report said that some women
classified as contracting the disease through intravenous drug use may have
acquired AIDS through heterosexual sex. And some women whose AIDS was attributed
to heterosexual sex may have had an unreported risk factor, such as intravenous
drug use.

One of the challenges of AIDS surveillance is the accurate identification of
cases attributed to heterosexual transmission, Dr. Ward said.

Checking Causes

To check on such accuracy, the C.D.C. has conducted a pilot study in South
Florida, re-interviewing people whose AIDS had initially been reported as due to
heterosexual transmission, Dr. Ward said. In that small study, 14 percent of the
cases involving women attributed to heterosexual sex were reclassified because
the women acknowledged another risk factor. In the same study, 40 percent of the
men initially reported as heterosexual cases were reclassified.

The Federal agency plans to extend the study to six cities, including New York,
Dr. Ward said.

At an international meeting on AIDS in Berlin last month, experts warned about
the increase in H.I.V. infections among teen-agers. In its report yesterday, the
C.D.C. said heterosexual transmission accounted for a greater proportion of AIDS
cases among women 20 to 29 years old than among women 30 and older. This
increase among the 20- to 29-year-olds is primarily attributed to the number of
girls and women infected as teen-agers.

Rockers' famine plan ends with mixed success

BYLINE: Akwe Amosu and Julian Ozanne

SECTION: SECTION 2, SPECTRUM; Pg. 19, REPORT FROM THE FINANCIAL TIMES OF LONDON

LENGTH: 1708 words

DATELINE: London,England


  After Band Aid, nothing would ever be the same.

The multimillion-dollar fund-raising effort to fight famine in Africa that
galvanized public support in 1984 had given new meaning to the concept of a
global conscience. The future - for donor and recipient - would be different.

Almost five years later, all the money has been allocated and the Band Aid
machine has begun to wind down.

Band Aid was born in the aftermath of the devastating famine that swept through
Ethiopia, Sudan and the rest of the Sahel five years ago.

Bob Geldof, an Irish rock star with a few hits to his name, was moved to action.
He raised US$10 million in less than six months with a troupe of pop stars
singing Do They Know It's Christmas?

Another US$80 million was raised six months later with Live Aid, a 16-hour
transatlantic rock concert. A rash of other events brought the total to US$140
million.

It was an act of unprecedented generosity, bridging the global north-south
divide. But Band Aid was more than raising money.

Many rejoiced at the sight of ''St. Bob'' - one minute in Addis Ababa, the next
in Brussels - criticizing diplomats and attacking bureaucracy. Perhaps a
political change could be also be achieved.


MIXED RECORD

Did it all succeed? Geldof, who got Band Aid off the ground, is sure it did.

The record, however, is mixed. There is a constant threat of a repeat of the
fatal Sahelian famine, and the organization was responsible for both successful
and disastrous development projects. Geldof is also conscious there has been
little change in the political realities in Africa that exacerbate famine.

Band Aid set out to save as many lives as possible, but funds were also
allocated for long-term development to prevent a repeat catastrophe.

The plan was to have minimum-cost effort for maximum gain. Geldof was determined
Band Aid would be a temporary organization responding to a crisis, rather than a
permanent fund-raising institution.

Father Angus Finucane of the Irish charity Concern says there can be no doubt
Band Aid saved thousands of lives. Other relief workers agree. Anthony Nedley,
Oxfam's national relief co-ordinator in Sudan, was working on a relief
monitoring project in Juba in 1986 and was short of funds.

''Band Aid leapt in straight away. They can move faster than any other donor in
getting money to an emergency,'' Nedley says.

Band Aid purchased relief goods; paid for their shipment to Ethiopia and Sudan;
purchased, fueled and maintained fleets of trucks in both countries; and funded
other agencies that were making airlifts. In total, US$67.5 million has been
used for emergency expenditure since early 1985.

Many aid workers, however, found Band Aid's inexperience a frustration. One,
from an agency that was one of Band Aid's largest beneficiaries, recalls painful
meetings sitting on the floor in ramshackle offices and being ''preached at
about your own business'' by people with little experience of famine relief.

HUGE SUMS

In turn, Band Aid was critical of the huge sums of money spent by aid agencies
on personnel and administration. Tony Vaux of Oxfam, the British aid agency,
believes problems may have been caused by Band Aid's refusal to have a formal
administrative capacity.

In the early days, Geldof's organization was reluctant to give funds and wanted
to buy and distribute the goods itself. But Band Aid was clogging up its own
system with purchasing deals it did not have the administration to control.

Band Aid was forced to soften its position on this issue, but other agencies
also learned something. Vaux says: ''Maybe Band Aid has shown us that a lot can
be done without admin costs. They did make tremendous use of free donations in a
way that agencies like Oxfam don't any more. But you need a Bob Geldof to
attract the donations in the first place.''

Band Aid's change of emphasis to long-term aid emerged in July, 1985, after the
Live Aid concert. By October, a committee of experts had been formed under the
chairmanship of Brian Walker, of the International Institute of Environment &
Development, to assess the applications for aid pouring in. Field staff were
also recruited.

The projects had to take risks where others could not, or would not. The
beneficiaries would have to be the poorest of the poor who could co-design the
project along with the agency offering it.


The benefits also had to be sustainable. Favored projects strengthened ''coping
mechanisms'' - the way those on the ground dealt with droughts, floods and other
problems.

The committee - which some saw as too heavily weighted with academics, rather
than aid practitioners - met roughly once a month and by the end of last year
had assessed and discussed more than 1,000 projects. It recommended funding just
189.


The projects funded have included sinking wells, making dams, starting market
gardens and supporting agro-forestry projects. Soil conservation, immunization,
truck repair workshops, bee-keeping and school textbook-making have all been
backed.

Band Aid's development project work in Sudan was controversial, and some aid
agencies resented its ''holier-than-thou'' attitude. Some aid workers also felt
the stress on minimal costs was dangerous.

Each project eventually allocated funds had to go through a laborious process of
assessment, with the project's London-based selection committee vetting
proposals for waste and excessive costs. Some relief work was held up because
applicants could not meet Band Aid's demands for information.

Says Iain Macdonald, Sudan's director of Euro-Action Accord 1985-1988: ''They
concentrated too much on not wasting money and missed a lot of high-risk, but
high-need projects. It got to the point that to get money out of them you had to
know someone inside or spend months gathering detailed information and going
through their process.

''Band Aid contributed to the myth that a little bit of money could solve the
problem. Any approach which raises hope in the short run and is based on emotion
is ultimately nonsustainable. Geldof aroused a whole new section of the
population. Like a pied piper, he led them off into the desert and left them
there.''

Paradoxically, Band Aid was also criticized for its apparent determination to
disburse its funds too quickly. Penny Jenden, Band Aid's director overseeing the
allocation of the last few dollars, regrets it is all finally coming to an end,
even though many months more distribution and monitoring remain.

To keep costs low, Band Aid delayed setting up a Khartoum office for two years
and ran a one-man show out of a bedroom in a small hotel.

In Sudan, says Oxfam co-ordinator Anthony Nedley, ''they employed human dynamos
with no secretarial support, who ran around the country promising the earth but
couldn't deliver because they had no logistics back-up. It was far too
temporary, makeshift and lacking in structure to be really effective.''

Inevitably, money was ill-spent. The Band Aid representatives were swamped with
proposals they could not properly vet, but they claim the organization has
retrieved misappropriated funds.

EYES AND EARS

One area where the Geldof team broke new ground was in its encouragement of
local nongovernment committees in the countries where it was funding projects.
The committees are Band Aid's eyes and ears on the ground. Of the four set up,
those in Niger and Chad have effectively collapsed, but those in Burkina Faso
and Mali are operating successfully.

Now Band Aid has given money to these last two so they can fund projects
directly, rather than sending their recommendations to London. Funds are
channeled via the local committees rather than the governments. The change
represents a potential shake-up in the aid industry.

A criticism leveled at Band Aid has been was that its view of progress is too
narrow. Vaux says: ''The image one retains is of Bob Geldof standing on a dam
and saying, 'this is progress.' It isn't. The dam in Eritrea, for instance, is
in a war area, and has not been usable.''

And the political problems remain. Hopes that Band Aid was so influential it
might induce political changes in famine areas were not realized.

Band Aid does not believe it has a mandate to make grand statements about the
politics of Africa's crisis. But during his tours of drought-affected areas,
Geldof made no secret of his anger at politicians. He is still angry.

The ''endless militarization of the continent'' must stop, he says. He despairs
of what he describes as the battle in Ethiopia between ''two second-hand
European ideologies, capitalism and socialism.''


Geldof thinks a relatively declining commitment to aid by governments is a
global problem. Only the Scandinavian countries pay the UN-recommended aid
minimum.

''There should be a moratorium on Africa's foreign debt,'' he says. ''It is an
irrelevance to the global economy; but it's crippling them.''

In the end, any assessment of Band Aid's operation is likely to be inconclusive.
On the relief front, Band Aid saved lives as it intended. But Ethiopia, despite
all aid efforts and good rains in 1988, is still in crisis.

''They are heading for a famine now as surely as they were in 1983,'' Vaux says.
''It will only take one bad year and Ethiopia will be back where Band Aid
started.''

The World Food Program estimates 221,000 metric tons of food will be needed, but
there are only 13,000 metric tons in store. Ironically, the good rains last year
lulled the donor community into a false sense of security. This is the first
time the aid pipeline has been empty since 1985.

In the final accounting, Band Aid has spent about 50% of its funds on relief. It
has something more lasting to show with the other 50%. One close observer
speculates up to 30% of the development projects it funded are worth repeating.
Others are bound to prove failures, often for reasons outside project
organizers' control.

But the less tangible developments are more interesting. Band Aid's moves to get
African agencies more closely involved in the development of their own backyard,
as in Burkina Faso and Mali, are in tune with the times.

EMPLOYERS FACE UP TO AIDS

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, March 11


Despite the soaring number of AIDS cases around the nation, most big companies
have yet to confront the disease and the problems it brings to the workplace,
health industry consultants and other experts say.

''The average company is doing nothing,'' said Dr. Alan Emery, a clinical
psychologist and business consultant with the San Francisco AIDS Foundation, a
leading provider of educational materials on acquired immune deficiency
syndrome. He estimated that less than 10 percent of companies in the United
States have an AIDS program or policy.

But here in San Francisco, which has a large homosexual population and probably
the highest incidence of AIDS per capita in the country, a number of major
companies have decided that AIDS can no longer be ignored. The companies -
including Levi Strauss, BankAmerica, Pacific Telesis and Wells Fargo - have all
introduced ambitious health and information programs designed to help employees
with AIDS while allaying the fears of their co-workers.

''It has probably saved me one million words and a lot of anxiety,'' said Nick
Latham, an employee with AIDS at the San Francisco office of Towers, Perrin,
Forster & Crosby, a consulting concern that has a similar program.

A Leader in the Movement

Levi Strauss, the jeans maker long known for its unusual commitment to its
employees and for its philanthropic activities, is considered a leader in the
movement. At least a dozen of Levi's 1,500 employees here have contracted the
incurable disease, and several have died, said Larry Holmes, a member of a
homosexual employees' group at the company.

Levi has responded with a program that apparently appeals both to AIDS victims
and their co-workers at the company's offices here. While the program has
encountered resistance at some of Levi's other operations, particularly in the
South, it is seen as a model for companies still trying to determine what they
should do about the disease, most of whose victims have been homosexual men and
intravenous drug abusers. The program includes these key features:

* The company prohibits discrimination against employees with the disease. That
means treating AIDS victims - in terms of benefits, medical coverage and their
right to work - like any employee with a life-threatening illness that cannot be
transmitted in the normal course of work.

* Levi offers home health care as well as hospice care for the terminally ill,
in addition to regular hospital coverage. Such outpatient treatment, said Robert
D. Haas, the company's president and chief executive, not only is often more
humane than long-term hospitalization, but is less costly as well.

* It encourages employees with AIDS to stay on the job as long as they can.
Whenever possible, flexible work schedules or part-time jobs are made available.

* While it favors openness about the disease itself, Levi is very protective of
employee confidentiality.

'The Pioneer'

''Levi Strauss is the pioneer in creating a responsible, ethical and humane AIDS
program,'' Dr. Emery said To be sure, a growing number of companies in other
cities are becoming active in dealing with AIDS. In New York, CBS, Citicorp, the
New York Life Insurance Company and Nynex are among those given high marks.
Nonetheless, the efforts by Levi and others here appear to stand out, at least
in part because of the homosexual community's unique status in San Francisco.

''It is difficult to be gay in corporate America anywhere, but less difficult in
San Francisco than in New York,'' said Benjamin Schatz, director of the AIDS
civil rights project of the National Gay Rights Advocates, a San Francisco-based
group. ''Gay people in San Francisco are now part of the power structure. We
didn't have to fight to have the AIDS crisis recognized the way people did in
other parts of the country, including New York.''

With health experts predicting that the number of AIDS cases will rise
dramatically in coming years, Levi's Mr. Haas warned that the disease would
become a much more serious problem for business. Some 31,000 cases have been
reported in the United States since 1981, when AIDS was first identified, with
the San Francisco area accounting for about 3,100 and New York 8,700.

Mr. Haas predicted that ''the law is going to force employers to do some of the
same things we have done'' to keep employees with AIDS on the job. The
California Fair Employment and Housing Commission recently prohibited employers
from discriminating against workers with AIDS. And last week, the United States
Supreme Court ruled that recipients of Federal money may not discriminate
against people who are impaired by contagious diseases. While the case involved
an employee suffering from tuberculosis, it could benefit many people with AIDS.


Started in '82

Mr. Haas's personal involvement in the AIDS cause dates back to 1982, when some
employees requested permission to distribute AIDS information in the lobby of
the company's headquarters. To allay these employees' fears that co-workers
would assume they were homosexual or had AIDS and would shun them, Mr. Haas and
other senior executives took turns manning the information booth.

About the same time, Levi suddenly got a taste of how misunderstandings about
AIDS can disrupt the workplace. A frantic manager called the company's Employee
Assistance Program fearful that she might catch AIDS from a subordinate just
because he was homosexual.

''That said to us that we had to provide educational materials to all
employees,'' said Yvonne Ellison-Sandler, head of the assistance program, which
provides health information and counseling to employees. She also heads Levi's
AIDS Task Force, an interdepartmental committee whose mission is to advise the
company on how to respond to AIDS-related issues.

The Key Fact

In the last five years, Levi's stand has been that it is in the best interests
of both the employees and the company that all workers understand the facts
about AIDS. And that includes the key fact that the AIDS virus is transmitted
sexually or intravenously, meaning that it cannot be caught in the normal course
of work.

''As employers, we have the responsibility to maintain an open and informed
working environment that at least combats unwarranted employee fears and
prejudices,'' Mr. Haas said.

Levi is using a variety of means to spread the word. It has taken pains to train
its managers and personnel staff. It also employs everything from a videotape
featuring medical experts and AIDS victims to brochures, lunchtime lectures and
articles in its Health and Fitness newsletter.

In interviews at Levi, most co-workers of AIDS victims strongly endorsed the
program.

James A. Bliss, controller of Levi's information resources department, recalled
that he had requested help to prepare his group for the return of a co-worker
who had contracted AIDS. Any trepidation that the workers might have had was
greatly diminished by the educational materials they were given, Mr. Bliss and
several others in the department said.

'They're Accepted'

''If a fellow employee is diagnosed and comes back, they're accepted,'' said Mr.
Holmes, the member of the homosexual employees' group. ''And the educational
program is a key reason why that's true.''

But one Levi employee confessed to having mixed feelings, expressing concerns
that the company would become ''a haven for gays - that's how good the program
is.''

And Levi officials acknowledge that getting employees to listen can be
difficult. That is especially true in the South, where the company has many of
its production facilities.

''We've had some struggles out in the field,'' said Robert H. Dunn, vice
president for corporate communications and community affairs.

In reaction, Levi says it might come out with a ''Southern edition'' of the AIDS
videotape. The new version would include AIDS victims who are not necessarily
homosexual. $100,000 in Donations With AIDS rapidly becoming a national crisis,
Levi has also felt compelled to play an active public role. The company and its
employees have donated more than $100,000 to a variety of AIDS projects,
including a hospice and a public education program.

Mr. Haas also persuaded the Business Leadership Task Force of the Bay Area, a
group of 14 chief executives of major corporations, to take up the AIDS cause.

Last year, the group played host to a conference on AIDS in the workplace
attended by representatives of 100 companies. It has also financed the
development of training and educational materials.

'By the end of 1991, an estimated 270,000 cases of AIDS will have occurred with
179,000 deaths . . . Work sites should have a plan in operation for education of
the work force and accommodation of AIDS or ARC (Aids Related Complex) patients
before the first such case appears at the work site.'

C. Everett Koop, U.S. Surgeon General
  October 1986

Corporate Pioneers
The following companies are among the pacesetters in addressing AIDS by
initiating and funding education programs:

* A.T.& T.
* BankAmerica
* Chevron Corp.
* Levi Strauss
* Pacific Telesis
* Transamerica Life Companies
* Wells Fargo

TEXT:
 On November 29, the ASIL hosted an informative briefing on "World AIDS Day: The
AIDS Epidemic and International Law and Policy." The briefing, a part of the
ASIL's series of briefings under its Outreach Program sponsored by the Ford
Foundation, was presented by Robert E. Stein, a Washington, DC attorney who is
an expert on HIV law.  Stein is also an adjunct professor of law at Georgetown
University where he teaches a seminar on HIV Law, Policy and Dispute Resolution.

   This briefing was timely since December 1 was World AIDS Day and top
officials from 42 countries met in Paris to consider international policy issues
in the AIDS epidemic.  The U.S. delegation was led by Health and Human Services
Secretary Donna Shalala.  Stein said that during this meeting a Declaration
would be approved, but that this was only a first step in coordinating
international action to deal with the AIDS crisis.

   Stein gave alarming statistics concerning the growing numbers of people
globally who are infected with HIV and who have AIDS.  He said that the World
Health Organization (WHO) predicts there will be 40 million people infected with
HIV by the end of the century, with 90% of those infected living in developing
countries, and that approximately ten million children will lose their parents
to AIDS.  The AIDS epidemic has caused and will continue to cause economic
problems in many countries, where the problems range from countries losing the
most productive workers, young adults, to AIDS to not being able to afford
research and treatment for AIDS patients.

   International law has lagged behind in setting rules and standards pertaining
to the AIDS epidemic.  Stein said that while the UN General Assembly and the
World Health Organization have started to deal more readily with the AIDS
crisis, more needs to be done.  He spoke about a few issues that need to be
specifically addressed.  One issue is that of women's rights to protect
themselves against AIDS.  In many countries, women who have contracted the
disease from  their husbands have no rights to protect themselves, and what laws
there are are biased against women.  Another issue is that of the safety of the
blood supply around the world.  Stein said that many countries have unsafe blood
supplies and that there is a need for an international standard to be set to
make blood supplies safe.

   Stein spoke about the issue of discrimination against those with AIDS in the
workplace, and commented that some international organizations are providing
educational materials to their employees about AIDS.  All organizations should
follow suit.  Another issue that needs to be addressed is immigration and travel
restrictions for those with AIDS.  Over forty countries currently have laws
disallowing those infected with AIDS to travel or immigrate into their country.
Some countries allow only certain groups, or allow them to stay only a certain
amount of time.  Finally, he said, there are problems in drug and vaccine
development.  He spoke about the international implications of AIDS research and
the question of whether there should be national or international standards for
developing and testing vaccines.  He discussed the legal questions about testing
and distribution that could arise if a successful vaccine is found.

   Stein made suggestions for ways to more effectively deal with the AIDS crisis
in the future.  He suggested that equality, privacy and knowledge about AIDS be
developed in the workplace and that more information on AIDS be made available
to the general public.  In conclusion, he argued that: travel restrictions for
those with AIDS should be reduced, women's rights should be supported, human
rights resolutions should be looked at again to see how they include people with
AIDS, and work should be expanded for screening blood supplies.  The world is,
he said, in the very early stages of this epidemic and international law
inevitably will play an important role in the AIDS epidemic.

What makes a country dangerous for aid workers?;
The attack on Kunduz hospital in Afghanistan suggests that humanitarian work is
becoming more perilous, but new research reveals the full picture is more
complex

BYLINE: Jason Miklian, Kristian Hoelscher and Håvard Mokleiv Nygård

LENGTH: 1121 words


On 3 October last year an AC-130 gunship operating for the US Air Force made
five bombing runs over a nondescript hospital in the city of Kunduz,
Afghanistan. Typically loaded with Gatling cannons, howitzers and Hellfire
missiles, the AC-130  hit and destroyed the hospital's emergency wing.

It quickly became clear that this wasn't a military success, but one of the
worst attacks on humanitarian aid workers in history. Médecins Sans Frontière
(MSF) reported that 14 of their staff members were killed, along with at least
24 patients and four caretakers.  MSF called the attack proof of the global
erosion of the rules of war, and many decried the event as evidence that the
lives of aid workers are ever-more threatened.

The number of aid workers globally has tripled since 2000, and per capita
attacks have actually fallen slightly.

Incidents like Kunduz appear to show that humanitarian aid work is an
increasingly dangerous occupation - and not only in hot wars like Afghanistan
and Syria. Even countries previously considered safe, like Bangladesh, have seen
extremist groups begin to target aid staff. And threats of sexual violence and
widespread mental health concerns add to the myriad risks aid workers
experience. With aid organisations increasingly working in riskier environments
to reach those most in need, 2013 was the deadliest year on record for aid
workers, with nearly 500 attacks.

But digging deeper into the data is important. While any increase in attacks is
concerning, the number of aid workers globally has tripled since 2000, and per
capita attacks on aid workers have actually fallen slightly over this period.
Reflecting this ambiguity, Abby Stoddard, partner at Humanitarian Outcomes,
cautions against oversimplifying the nuanced data. For agencies, there is little
systematic information about which underlying environments actually place aid
workers in greatest danger, and why.

Yet data collection efforts over the past decade have begun to make progress in
understanding such underlying trends. To try and decipher these puzzles, we
studied national-level data on aid worker attacks, conflicts, security issues
and development indicators between 1997 and 2014.

Related:  Guardian research suggests mental health crisis among aid workers

Our research uncovered five key characteristics about the countries where aid
workers are assumed to be most at risk.

1. Countries at war are more dangerous

This one wasn't a surprise. Our findings show that aid workers are much more
likely to be attacked in countries hosting conflicts than those at peace. Also,
more violent conflicts see more aid worker attacks. High-intensity conflicts
(more than 2,000 deaths each year) see roughly twice the number of aid worker
attacks as medium-intensity conflict (around 400 deaths per year). The lesson is
clear: conflicts increase risks for field staff; and the more intense the
conflict, the greater likelihood of attacks. Unfortunately, these are often
precisely the places where aid workers are needed most.

2. Whether combatants follow the "rules of war" has little impact

While risks to aid workers have been linked to broader issues of civilian
protection, and a disrespect for international law, we found no evidence that
conflicts where combatants actively target civilians pose a greater risk for aid
workers. This surprising finding may help to encourage a more sustained presence
for aid agencies in such countries, where local vulnerabilities and needs are
often the greatest.

3. Criminal violence doesn't influence risk of attack

Some suggest that general insecurity can increase risks for humanitarian staff.
However our findings suggest that the national homicide rate (a reasonably good
measure of social violence ), the presence of criminal groups and other
"everyday" threats to aid workers is unrelated to aid worker attacks. This could
be good news for aid organisations. Either countries with elevated violence are
no riskier for operations or the additional precautions that aid actors take
when deploying to these countries have been effective.

4. An international military presence isn't riskier - but UN peacekeeping forces
might be

Some assume that a large foreign military presence might increase the incentives
for insurgents to attack humanitarian workers. Yet we find that where Nato
deploys forces, there are just as many (or as few) attacks on aid workers as
where Nato is not present. If anything, our results suggest countries with Nato
forces may in fact see fewer attacks on aid workers.

However, countries with UN peacekeeping operations have more attacks against aid
workers - and this risk increases with the size of the operation. The type also
matters. Countries hosting peacekeeping operations with traditional mandates
(observing truces or peace agreements, or policing buffer zones) are more risky
for aid workers.

5. More developed states are safer

As expected, economic and political development usually coincide with lower
levels of risk to aid workers. More developed countries (as measured in terms of
GDP per capita) see fewer aid worker attacks; and more democratic countries also
see fewer attacks than autocracies. Yet, interestingly, "transitional
democracies" - countries that are neither fully autocratic nor democratic and
are often at greater risk of political and criminal violence - are no more
dangerous for aid workers than established western-style democracies.

While tragedies like that in Kunduz are highly visible reminders of the dangers
of humanitarian work, our findings show that aid worker threats evolve from a
wide range of factors. With agency security protocols increasingly scrutinised
as they undertake a wider variety of development and peacebuilding tasks than
ever before, a better understanding of the parameters of humanitarian risk is
essential. Country context is vitally important to see where and why aid workers
are most at risk and it is crucial the industry gains a better understanding of
this. Only then will we be able to start working towards making a safer and more
predictable global environment for aid workers.

Complacency forces Aids back into the shadows

Complacency forces Aids back into the shadows

laments the world's waning commitment to 'disease of the poor'

The great social movements risk becoming extinct

STARTING today, thousands of activists, scientists and government officials will
troop to Melbourne, Australia, to partici-pate in the 20th International Aids
Conference.

Melbourne, where Aids is largely an academic issue because most people who live
with HIV are on treatment. Melbourne, which has a first-world health system.
Melbourne, 10000km from Africa, where tens of thousands still die of Aids.
Melbourne, 9088km from China, where Aids activists are harassed, threatened and
imprisoned.

Once, the activist response to Aids changed the world. Now, it seems the world
is trying to change the response to Aids again.

In the early 2000s, Aids was an issue that evoked our common humanity. Across
the world, Aids mobilised people regardless of race, class or sexual orientation
to stand up for people's equal rights to life and dignity. Aids taught us to
understand sexual orientation as a matter of choice to be celebrated, not
castigated.

A truly global movement for the treatment of Aids helped to establish the idea
that access to life-saving medicines was a human right that should be protected
by law against voracious companies that sought to make huge profits from illness
and the fear of death.

Today, Aids is fast becoming just another disease of the poor, criminalised and
marginalised. It is just another manifestation of global complacency about
poverty and inequality.

Aids is slinking ashamedly back into the shadows, where many think it should
always have been, like tuberculosis.

The antiretrovirals (ARVs) we fought for are now one more hard-to-come-by
necessity of life, one more insecurity based on the reliance on governments that
cannot give them jobs, quality education or dignified and effective public
health services.

Once upon a time, Aids brought out the best in us. Today it reflects the worst.
Aids, like apartheid, once helped privileged people to see the need to get out
of their comfort zones and discover their shared humanity with the poor.

Aids helped middle-class people, with the best of intentions, to dip their toes
in the dark lives of the poor, sometimes even keeping them there for a few
chilly years.

But, as the movement has receded (as social movements do), they have pulled
their toes out again, moved on with secure living, leaving the shadow poor once
more to fend for themselves in the shadowlands.

Aids points fingers at academics who romanticised and theorised about "social
movements" when they were on the rise, but deserted them when they began the
difficult days of staying alive.

Aids rebukes media houses who brought Aids to light and now help to put it back
in the shadows, as well as journalists who found heroes, but now ignore the real
ones because they are poorer or darker.

Aids reviles editors who place something in the past when it is still in the
present.

In South Africa today, defending the rights of people with Aids to access ARVs
has fallen back on the same organisation that struggled to make it an issue in
the first place, the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC).

Last week, the TAC was forced to embark on another civil disobedience campaign
in the Free State, a province in which too few people are on ARVs due to a
collapsing health system and weak management.

The TAC is refusing to go back to its place in the shadowlands.

Finally, be aware that the great social movements that once rose to fight Aids
risk becoming extinct.

For example, in a world awash with money, the TAC is struggling to get the funds
it needs to keep activism alive.

It seems as if the TAC is an organisation that stands for an ethic and an image
that are no longer valid currency in the donor "market" - human rights, equality
and political accountability.

In this context, Aids should force you to question the duplicity of
international aid, the donors who rode on Aids while it was a badge they could
use for self-gratification, but whose short-sightedness and lack of enduring
commitment to poor people's health is once more plain to see.

Aids also makes us doubt many philanthropic foundations that one year get on
their highly educated, untouchable, unquestionable horses and dispense alms to
rising social movements - and the next year criticise them when they try to do
the much more difficult, much less visible, less sexy task of holding a
government to the implementation of its policies.

Aids makes us see sexy aid, not shadow aid.

You might well ask what we owe to those movements that campaigned to save
millions of lives and still have a job to save millions more.

You might well ask when societies will invest in their own democracy.

If you don't ask these questions, by the time you get to the 21st International
Aids Conference, which will take place in Durban in 2016, the TAC may be

Hearing aids go high tech with the help of an iPhone

May 06--It used to be that hearing aids carried the weighty stigma of old age.

The devices were bigger and bulkier. If you had a pair in your ears, it was a
sign you were getting older, or maybe losing your edge.

But over time, technology has improved so hearing aids are sleeker, less
noticeable and even better at helping people take in the world around them, said
Mindy Brudereck, an audiologist and co-owner of Berks Hearing Professionals,
which has offices in Birdsboro and Wyomissing.

But what if hearing aids could be fun and even cool?

"The stigma to some degree is lessening every year," Brudereck said. "We can
make them smaller and make them less visible. To make them cool is another
level, because we're connecting them with technology that most people haven't
even seen yet. It makes you say, 'Oh my gosh, look what my new hearing aid can
do.' "

Two Minnesota-based companies -- GN ReSound, and Starkey Hearing Technologies --
recently designed hearing aids made specifically to connect with Apple products
such as the iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad. They allow patients to do all sorts of
things, such as stream music directly from their phone to the hearing aids or
take a call using Bluetooth technology.

"I think we're all pretty amazed by what they can do," Brudereck said.

Brudereck talked about the new made-for-iPhone hearing aids and what they could
mean for those with hearing loss.

What are some of the things these new devices can do?

For the last month, Brudereck has been working with Starkey's Halo hearing aid,
which was designed to connect with the free Apple app called TruLink.

She said the app allows patients to adjust their hearing-aid levels to
accommodate noisier or quieter settings. Using the GPS on an Apple device, the
app can automatically change those noise settings depending on whether a person
is at home, a noisy coffee shop, a nightclub or a crowded restaurant.

Users can also stream audio from music, video and FaceTime calls directly from
their iPhone to the hearing aid. If they want to hear someone speaking at the
other end of the room, they just need to put the phone in front of that person.

"If we were in a noisy situation like a restaurant, I could hand you my iPhone
and it would pick up the voice directly to the hearing aid," she said.

The app even has a signal detector that can help users find their lost hearing
aids.

Brudereck said other companies have developed technology that can connect phones
to their hearing aids, but they usually require extra accessories to make that
connection happen.

"I think this is something we're going to see more and more of," she said. "The
other hearing-aid manufactures are doing something similar, but they don't have
direct connection between the phone and hearing aid."

What's the feedback from patients?

Over the last month, Brudereck has heard from patients who were impressed by the
new hearing aids. She said one of the key things is the ease with which patients
can adjust the noise settings to a adjust for any situation.

She said hearing-aid manufacturers are always looking to improve the
"signal-to-noise ratio," and the new aids can help improve the ability of
patients to hear speech over the background.

"The more we can improve patients signal-to-noise ratio, the more we can improve
their ability to hear over background noise, the better and the happier they
are," Brudereck said.

She said eliminating the other hearing-aid accessories is another plus.

Does the new technology reduce the old hearing-aid stigma?

Brudereck said the prominence of people like Derrick Coleman, a fullback in the
NFL who is deaf, has helped convince people to look at hearing aids in a new
light. She said seeing people of prominence using hearing aids helps tell others
that hearing aids are not a negative thing.

"That serves to lessen the stigma," she said.

Even with the new technology, the direct iPhone connections and the sleeker
designs, Brudereck said people are also ranking their ability to communicate
with others ahead of those old concerns.

"Communication is a huge part of our life," Brudereck said. "I think more and
more people would rather communicate and do it well. People are smarter about
the value of communication."

multiplied by its
2.28transition factor; plus (2) its city revenue need calculated under the
formula in paragraph
2.29(b) multiplied by the difference between one and its transition factor. For
purposes of this
2.30paragraph, a city's "transition factor" is equal to 0.2 multiplied by the
number of years that
2.31the city's population estimate has been 2,500 or more. This provision only
applies for aids
2.32payable in calendar years 2006 to 2008 to cities with a 2002 population of

number of
3.19jobs per capita in the city, and (3) its population. For cities with a
population less than
3.205,000, the city jobs base is equal to zero. For a city receiving aid under
subdivision 36,
3.21paragraph (k), its city jobs base is reduced by the lesser of 36 percent of
the amount of
3.22aid received under that paragraph or $1,000,000. No city's city jobs base
may exceed
3.23$4,725,000 under this paragraph.
3.24    (b) For calendar year 2010 and subsequent years, the city jobs base for
a city, as
3.25determined in paragraph (a), is multiplied by the ratio of the appropriation
under section
3.26477A.03, subdivision 2a, for the year in which the aid is paid to the
appropriation under
3.27that section for aids payable in 2009.
3.28    (c) For purposes of this subdivision, "Jobs per capita in the city"

Economic
3.31Development, for the most recent calendar year available as of May 1, 2008
November 1 of
3.32every odd-numbered year, divided by (2) the city's population for the same
calendar year as
3.33the employment data. The commissioner of the Department of Employment and
Economic
3.34Development shall certify to the city the average annual number of employees
for each
3.35city by June 1, 2008 January 15, of every even-numbered year beginning with

it had under
4.2this subdivision for aids payable in 2013. A city may challenge an estimate
under this
4.3paragraph by filing its specific objection, including the names of employers
that it feels
4.4may have misreported data, in writing with the commissioner by June 20, 2008
December
4.51 of every odd-numbered year. The commissioner shall make every reasonable
effort to
4.6address the specific objection and adjust the data as necessary. The
commissioner shall

4.15highest city population reported in a federal census from the 1970 census or
later. "Peak
4.16population decline" shall not be less than zero.
4.17EFFECTIVE DATE.This section is effective for aids payable in calendar year
4.182014 and thereafter.

4.19    Sec. 6. Minnesota Statutes 2012, section 477A.013, subdivision 8, is

formula aid for a
4.21city is equal to the sum of (1) its 2013 certified aid and (2) the product
of (i) the difference
4.22between its unmet need and its 2013 certified aid and (ii) the aid gap
percentage.
4.23    (b) For aids payable in 2015 and thereafter, the formula aid for a city
is equal to
4.24the sum of (1) its city jobs base, (2) its small city aid base, and (3) the
need increase
4.25percentage multiplied by the average of its unmet need for the most recently
available two
4.26years formula aid in the previous year and (2) the product of (i) the
difference between
4.27its unmet need and its certified aid in the previous year under subdivision
9, and (ii)
4.28the aid gap percentage.
4.29No city may have a formula aid amount less than zero. The need increase aid
gap
4.30 percentage must be the same for all cities.
4.31    The applicable need increase aid gap percentage must be calculated by
the
4.32Department of Revenue so that the total of the aid under subdivision 9
equals the total
4.33amount available for aid under section 477A.03. Data used in calculating
aids to cities
5.1under sections 477A.011 to 477A.013 shall be the most recently available data
as of

5.10    (b) For aids payable in 2013 and 2014 only, the total aid in the
previous year for
5.11any city shall mean the amount of aid it was certified to receive for aids

be less than the
5.22amount it was certified to receive in 2013. For aids payable in 2010 2015
and thereafter,

With 10 per cent of the population suffering from hearing loss, the hwaring aid
market may be growing but buyer beware, there is a lot of money at stake, writes
JOHN CRADDEN.

EVER SINCE glasses lost their label/image as medical aids or devices, and with
it the stigma once strongly associated with wearing them, some have hopefully
predicted that hearing aids will go the same way.

It s even mooted that just as some fashionistas with perfect sight will wear
designer label specs with plain glass, a trendy design of fake hearing aid could
someday become a must-have accessory. According to a biography of 1980s English
rock band The Smiths, frontman Morrissey once wore a fake hearing aid to support
a hearing-impaired female fan who was ashamed of using one.

All the same, there has been a huge growth in the private hearing aid market.
Over the past five years the number of private hearing aid shops or clinics in
Ireland has almost doubled, according to the Irish Society of Hearing Aid
Audiologists (ISHAA), which represents most of the private hearing audiologists
in the Republic of Ireland.

The large optician chain Specsavers entered the hearing aid market in late 2006
with its first  hearing centre  in Limerick. It now has hearing aid shops in 12
other locations around the State   though not in Dublin. Hidden Hearing, another
UK firm, has 50 clinics throughout the island of Ireland and has plans for more.

It s almost impossible to say accurately how many deaf and hard of hearing
people there are in Ireland, but it s generally agreed that at least 10 per cent
of the population have some form of hearing loss, according to Deafhear
(formerly the National Association for Deaf People), which means more than
400,000.

This figure is widely expected to rise in the future because of our rapidly
ageing population as well as ear damage caused by constant exposure to high
levels of noise at work or music at rock concerts or nightclubs.

What this means is a potentially huge market for hearing aids, limited only by
the continuing stigma associated with them, or by large numbers of people who
don t know (or don t believe) they have a hearing loss.

But if you suspect you have a hearing loss and might benefit from a hearing aid,
your first port of call should still be your GP and not a hearing aid shop, says
Jean Hegarty, chairwoman of the Irish Society of Audiology (ISA), which
represents audiologists working for the HSE and other professionals in the field
of audiology.

The GP can at least rule out some temporary causes of hearing loss, such as
excessive earwax, any infections, discharge, etc. If your GP suspects you have a
hearing loss, they can refer you to a reputable private hearing aid clinic, she
says.

Only those with a medical card can be referred by the HSE to a public audiology
service in their local health board area, and avail of free hearing aids if
required.

Unfortunately, there is widespread evidence of people being sold hearing aids
from private shops staffed by unqualified dispensers who sell hearing aids worth
thousands of euro that may turn out to be totally unsuitable.  People are being
stung every day of the week,  says Hegarty.

Unfortunately, what can happen is that having been attracted to a fancy media
advertisement promising  miracle hearing , an individual can be exposed to high
pressure selling from someone with minimum training and end up committing
themselves to a purchase of a very expensive hearing aid without any proper
medical examination at all,  says Jim Sharkey, former president of the ISHAA and
senior audiologist with Advance Hearing in Dublin.

Trying to return a hearing aid, if unsatisfactory, can be made quite difficult,
as the dispenser would lose out on a hefty commission.

The ISHAA also strongly recommends consulting a GP first, and if a hearing aid
is suggested, then it recommends that the audiological assessment should be
carried out only by a properly qualified hearing aid audiologist.

The association, which has 84 members, estimates that there are currently up to
40 private hearing aid dispensers working in Ireland who are not properly
qualified or have done  questionable  internet courses.

The profession of private hearing aid dispensing is still not regulated in
Ireland, despite EU rules that came into force here in 1998. In the UK, hearing
aid dispensers have been regulated by the Hearing Aid Council (HAC) since 1968.
It is an offence to sell a hearing aid without being registered with the HAC,
including in Northern Ireland.

Sharkey says he and former ISHAA secretary Peter Ferguson wrote several letters
to the Minister for Health, Mary Harney, and had a meeting with the then
Minister of State Brian Lenihan in 2005, putting the case for an official
register of qualified hearing aid practitioners. But they have yet to receive a
definite answer   from the Department of Health.

On the positive side, work is ongoing on the development of an EU voluntary
standard for hearing aid professionals in private practice, involving experts
from throughout the EU.

The National Standards Authority of Ireland has been co-ordinating the input
from the Irish professional associations, including the ISHAA, the ISA, as well
as the Department of Family and Social Affairs (DSFA).

In the meantime, the closest thing to regulation is the DSFA s official register
(of sorts) of private hearing aid clinics. The department administers a
treatment benefit scheme (TBS), which provides for 50 per cent of the cost of
hearing aids up to a maximum of EUR 830 for each aid. This is a significant
grant and helps to offset the high cost of digital hearing aids.

Anyone with enough PRSI contributions under their belt can qualify for this
grant. The one condition is that you purchase your hearing aid from any one of
the department s list of registered hearing aid dispensers.

To qualify for inclusion on this list, the DFSA says that under the relevant
social welfare legislation, an audiologist must be a member of any one of the
following: the ISHAA, the BSHAA (British Society of Hearing Aid Audiologists),
BSA (British Society of Audiology) or BAA (British Academy of Audiology) or a US
organisation called the International Hearing Society (but only with a National
Board for Certification in Hearing Instrument Sciences qualification obtained
from the US).

This means that if you decide to shop around different private hearing aid
clinics, you should check if they are registered with the DSFA. You can find the
list on its website. If you go to a shop that is not, the chances are it is
staffed by unqualified dispensers and, therefore, not recommended.

It may also be worthwhile to cross-check the dispensers on this list with those
of the ISHAA, which is available from www.ishaa.ie. Unlike the DSFA list, which
lists the firms only, each member on the ISHAA is listed individually,
irrespective of whether they work for a large retail company, family practice,
small partnership or one-person business.

It must be stressed that because a firm employs one of our members it does not
necessarily follow that all the persons employed by that firm are ISHAA members
or hold a qualification,  the ISHAA s website states.

However, the ISHAA does not recognise the International Hearing Society s
qualification.

Why the high price tag?

It is almost universally acknowledged, both in Ireland and elsewhere, that
hearing aids are not cheap. Prices for a modern, digital hearing aid range from
about EUR 700-EUR 3,000 each, as there are many different types and levels of
sophistication.

It really is a case of  buyer beware , but if a person is sensible and shops
around, they will find that the majority of dispensers offer a good choice,
says Jim Sharkey, former president of the ISHAA (Irish Society of Hearing Aid
Audiologists).

It is generally advised to talk to two or three hearing aid users regarding
which supplier to choose.

While digital hearing aid technology has come a long way in the past few years
and has filtered down even into the cheapest hearing aids available today,
dispensers say that the cost of providing the service itself adds considerably
to the cost of buying a hearing aid, regardless of how cheap or expensive the
hearing aid is.

A good audiologist, it is argued, needs to take time with the selection and
fitting process, which includes testing, ear impressions, programming the aid,
follow-up appointments and dealing with drop-ins when problems occur. There are
more potential issues that they may have to deal with than for an optometrist
dispensing a new set of glasses, in other words.

College embraces HIV/AIDS fight

BYLINE: James Fuller, Daily Herald Staff Writer

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 8

LENGTH: 991 words


It's been nearly three years to the day since U2 lead singer Bono rocked
students and faculty at Wheaton College with the message that they have a moral
obligation to battle HIV and AIDS at home and abroad.

Thursday, the 18th World AIDS Day, the message was the same, but the faces
behind it were both more local and more international.

On a grassy patch known as "The Quad" in front of the science building,
photographed faces of a few dozen AIDS orphans stared out at passers-by in hopes
that some would stop, read the stories and "adopt" one of them.

In the science building behind the photos, Kristen Page took a gathering of
students and staff through AIDS 101. Page is a disease ecologist and fielded
questions about life expectancy, drug costs and treatments, and the history of
the disease.

Her lecture trod into some sensitive territory for the conservative Christian
college. Homosexuality, the use of condoms, multiple sex partners - none of them
are the hallmarks of the beliefs taught at the school.

But no one seemed to be judging. In fact, the school is tackling the HIV/AIDS
crisis as a campuswide project in some senses.

Page said college faculty members are looking to integrate AIDS education across
various subject areas to provide students with a well-rounded understanding of
the disease.

Associate Professor Christine Gardner will teach the college's first class
solely dedicated to the disease next fall. It will be titled "The Rhetoric of
AIDS."

It could serve many of the students well in the near future.

Many students are involved locally with Canticle Ministries, a group dedicated
to HIV/AIDS care and education in DuPage County. Thirty-two new HIV cases and 23
new AIDS cases were diagnosed in the county in the first eight months of 2005,
both increases over the same time period last year.

Students will host a Christmas party for some of those patients in a couple of
weeks.

Even more, some Wheaton College students will soon head off to Africa for
various internships and service projects.

One of those students is David Peyton Jr., who is most likely headed to Rwanda.
But Thursday, Peyton was occupied with spreading information about HIV/AIDS and
firing up fellow students to take action. He is president of the campus' Student
Global AIDS Campaign organization.

By 10:45 a.m., a board that started with the names of nearly 50 Chicago-area
AIDS orphans looking for adoption for the holidays has only two names remaining.
All 2,400 students, and most of the cooking staff in the cafeteria, had received
red AIDS ribbons to wear for the day.

They are signs that the college has embraced the AIDS cause as a shared mission,
Peyton said.

"The students tend to really support what we're doing," he said. "The college is
handling it in a responsible way. I don't think we could ask for a more
supportive administration. Today is about bringing people together to fight this
despite any differences."

How much do you know about AIDS?

It's a global health problem the likes of which humanity has seldom seen, an
incurable disease spreading quickly around the world killing millions each year.

It's AIDS.

Around the globe, leaders, activists and victims used World AIDS Day Thursday to
send the message that stronger action is needed in the battle against this
devastating disease.

It also may be a good time to check your own AIDS awareness.

Q. How bad is the global AIDS epidemic?

A. The disease kills 8,000 people every day worldwide or about 2.9 million per
year.

Q. How does that compare with cancer?

A. Cancer deaths average about 7 million worldwide each year.

Q. How many people have HIV now?

A. In 2005, more than 3 million people acquired HIV, which means there are now
more than 40 million people living with HIV and AIDS.

Q. I've heard HIV is worst in Africa. Is that true?

A. Yes. The latest U.N. estimates say 26 million of the 40 million people
infected with HIV worldwide live in Africa.

How the disease really spreads

World AIDS Day was marked by countries around the globe Thursday. Here are some
frequently asked questions about AIDS and the HIV virus.

Q. What is the difference between HIV and AIDS?

A. HIV stands for Human Immunodeficiency Virus. This is the virus known to cause
AIDS, Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. If someone is HIV-positive, it means
they have been infected with the virus. Those infected with HIV do not have AIDS
until the virus seriously damages their immune system, making them vulnerable to
a range of infections, some of which can lead to death.

Q. Is HIV easily spread? Can I get if from a kiss or casual contact?

A. You can get HIV in four ways: unprotected sexual intercourse with an infected
partner (the most common); sharing needles or other contaminated injection or
skin-piercing equipment; blood and blood products through, for example, infected
transfusions and organ or tissue transplants; transmission from infected mother
to child in the womb or at birth and breastfeeding.

Q. I'm HIV positive. Where can I go for information about treatments?

A. The CDC National AIDS Hotline can offer practical information on maintaining
health and general information about a wide variety of treatments, including
antiretrovirals and prophylaxis for opportunistic infections. The hotline
numbers are (800) 342-2437 (English), (800) 344-7432 (Spanish), and (888)
480-3739 (TTY). The CDC National AIDS Hotline can also provide referrals to
national treatment hotlines, local AIDS Service Organizations and HIV/AIDS-
knowledgeable physicians.

Q. Do the new drugs I hear about cure you?

A. The new drugs are a class of anti-HIV drugs known as protease inhibitors.
There is no cure for AIDS, but these drugs are helping to prolong the lives of
many people with AIDS and delaying the onset of AIDS in many people with HIV.
There is no standard treatment for everyone. A health care provider will discuss
individual options.

NEW AIDS CASES IN POLK INCREASES IN 2002; HIV AND AIDS CASES INCREASE THROUGHOUT
STATE, FLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SAYS.

BYLINE: ROBIN WILLIAMS ADAMS The Ledger

SECTION: News; Pg. A1

LENGTH: 926 words


LAKELAND -- Ninety-six new AIDS cases were reported in Polk County in 2002, a
noticeable increase from the low of 74 in 2001 and slightly higher than in
either 2000 and 1999.

Newly reported HIV cases in Polk County decreased to 83 in 2002, however, down
from the 116 in 2001. Those numbers include some patients identified with HIV
who developed AIDS before the year ended. The county has had 1,408 confirmed
AIDS cases in adults and teenagers since the disease began being reported in the
1980s.

Statewide, the Florida Department of Health reports an increase in both HIV and
AIDS.

The numbers alarm some local public-health workers and advocates for AIDS
services, who said there's increasing complacency about the disease.

Gloria Barnes, who monitors HIV/AIDS statistics for the Polk County Health
Department, said she saw that lack of concern when she joined outreach workers
at a neighborhood effort to persuade people to get tested.

"There was so much complacency it blew my mind," she said.

"It's the younger people who have the potential to increase greatly the spread
of the disease because they have more (sexual) partners."

During 1999-2001, the number of people who had newly diagnosed HIV infection
increased 10 percent among heterosexuals and 14 percent among men having sex
with men, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

That was in 25 states that have had HIV reporting since 1994. Florida began
reporting HIV cases in mid-1997.

"The general public doesn't see AIDS as scary anymore," said Cathy Robinson
Pickett, a local woman living with AIDS who is a co-founder of Friends Together,
an AIDS empowerment group.

"Clients also have become more complacent."

While powerful drugs keep the disease in check for many people, they don't cure
it, said Virginia Culbert, former director of Polk, Hardee, Highlands AIDS
Services and Education.

"It's still a deadly disease," she said. "It still has the possibility of making
people very sick or dying."

Patients develop resistance to the combination of medicines they take and some
aren't as careful as they should be about taking them faithfully, said Dr.
Daniel Haight, director of the Polk County Health Department.

"I've seen a number of things that have made me worry," he said.

Population growth in Polk may be another reason for the increase in locally
reported AIDS.

"I'm wondering if we are becoming more of an urban (area) where people feel more
comfortable living in our county and getting their care here," Haight said.

Spencer Lieb, epidemiologist with the state's HIV/AIDS bureau, has been
monitoring cases for the past few years to determine significant trends.

"Those numbers are always something that concern us," he said. "We want to see
if they show a trend."

The increase in reported HIV cases statewide is more significant than the one in
new AIDS cases, he said, because the increase is larger.

Florida's 5,119 AIDS cases newly reported last year were 65 more than the total
for 2001, Lieb said, while the 7,144 new HIV cases were 623 more, almost a 10
percent increase.

AIDS continued to hit black communities disproportionately.

More than half of people newly diagnosed with AIDS in Polk County last year --
57 of Polk's 96 new cases -- were black.

Blacks were 59 percent of new AIDS cases in Polk and 55 percent in Florida.
Fourteen percent of Polk's population is black.

Whites were 31 percent of Polk's AIDS cases, 30 of the 96. The eight Hispanics
diagnosed with AIDS in Polk were 8 percent of the total.

Statewide, whites were 28 percent and Hispanics 16 percent of 5,118 AIDS cases.

"How much more can we do in the black community?" said Barnes, who is black.

"I don't know. We're always looking for something new to get more people tested.
But there are deep-seated traditions against it."

In recent years, some black churches and social organizations in Polk County
have increased their efforts for AIDS awareness and education.

AIDS is one of the main initiatives this year, on a national level, for the
National Coalition of 100 Black Women. The Polk County chapter will do AIDS
awareness events in October, said Adrienne Darby, the chapter's program
chairwoman.

People familiar with AIDS issues said more must be done to raise awareness and
break through denial.

"The stigma behind the disease is terrible, especially in the African American
community," said a black man, who didn't give his name, at a recent support
group meeting for people infected or affected by HIV/AIDS.

Activists warn PM to spend on AIDS

BYLINE: By Donna Jean MacKinnon Toronto Star

   Prime Minister Kim Campbell's ability to win her own riding will depend on
her response to AIDS issues, activists say.

"Kim Campbell's riding has the highest incidents of AIDS in Canada," said Wayne
Dennis, a director of Positive Youth Outreach, an AIDS organization that focuses
on teens.

He added that the People With Aids Society in Vancouver Central, the Prime
Minister's riding, has more than 1,400 members.

"Each one has co-workers, friends and family who aren't going to vote for Kim
Campbell if there is not more funding for AIDS research," Dennis told a news
conference yesterday. "She only won by a slim margin of 274 votes last time."

Although the federal Conservatives last March committed $42.2 million for AIDS
"strategy" over five years, the AIDS community maintains this isn't nearly
enough.

AIDS activists admit the government currently gives a higher percentage of
funding to AIDS than other diseases but say that, if more research money isn't
found soon, it's going to cost far more in the future because of the rapid
spread of the affliction.

According to the activists, AIDS medication currently costs about $1,200 a month
and treatment costs about $100,000 per individual from the time of diagnosis to
death.

The AIDS groups represented at the news conference said approximately 40,000
people in Canada have AIDS or have tested HIV positive and this number is
increasing at an "alarming rate," especially among teens.

At a two-day national AIDS treatment forum held in Toronto last weekend, the 42
participants drew up a list of demands for government, including:

* Improving basic science research in Canada.

* Encouraging the development of innovative AIDS therapies.

* Allowing the Canadian HIV Trials Network to provide non-industry sponsored
trials.

* Encouraging small creative pharmaceutical and biotechnical firms.

* Providing accessible, cost- effective treatments for victims.

EPIDEMIC OF APATHY AIDS IS FAR FROM BEING CONTROLLED IN THE UNITED STATES, ;
EXPERTS WARN

SECTION: EVERYDAY MAGAZINE; Pg. 1D

LENGTH: 1775 words


EARLY IN this century, tuberculosis killed about 100,000 Americans a year,
infecting members of all socio-economic groups. Even so, most people believed
they were safe from the disease, that it was primarily a problem of the poor.
Tuberculosis was stopped by antibiotics 30 years ago, then quickly forgotten.
Today, AIDS - a far more deadly infection than TB - is public-health enemy No.
1.  Yet history is repeating itself: Most Americans believe that AIDS is an
illness that does not affect them, that it is a disease of gay males and
intravenous drug abusers, experts say.  Denial of the danger of AIDS infection,
however, only will ensure its relentless spread, doctors and public health
experts warn.  AIDS was first reported 11 years ago. Today, the epidemic is
raging out of control in Africa, Asia and Latin America, researchers say, and is
far from being controlled in the United States - despite the nation's much
greater medical resources.  Earlier this month, Dr. Jonathan Mann of Harvard
University's International AIDS Center tried to blast away some of the apathy
that surrounds AIDS. He called for ''a new global strategy'' for the AIDS
epidemic.  After questioning 40 experts, Mann projected that by the end of the
decade, 25 million people will have full-blown symptoms or cases of AIDS and 120
million more will be infected with the AIDS virus. (After infection with the
virus that causes AIDS - human immunodeficiency virus, known as HIV - it takes
about 10 years for full-blown AIDS symptoms to develop.) Top officials of the
World Health Organization (WHO), while not disputing the danger, say Mann's
predictions - and his call for new tactics - are off the mark. The health group
has its headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland.  The more conservative prediction
methods used by WHO show a lower incidence of AIDS. Worldwide, 40 million
people, including 10 million children, will be infected with the AIDS virus by
the year 2000, WHO officials believe.  These projections are sufficiently
serious, they say. Cooperative action, rather than a battle of predictions, is
needed to slow the epidemic, WHO officials say.  ''We are only at the beginning
of the AIDS epidemic, however, and which projections you believe isn't
important,'' Dr. Dorothy Blake, deputy director of WHO's Global Program in AIDS,
said in a telephone interview last week.  ''The focus should be to make sure
that none of the projections turns out to be true.'' AIDS infection rates can be
slowed down, even stabilized, if they are targeted at groups most susceptible to
infection, Blake said.  ''You must start with the fact that more than 90 percent
of AIDS is transmitted by sexual contact,'' Blake said. ''For example, you can
make an impact on the epidemic if you sustain educational efforts for groups at
greatest risk of infection - those who have several sexual partners, and drug
addicts who share needles.'' One effort is to persuade sexually active people to
use condoms, she said.  ''In Zaire, we've been promoting the use of condoms, and
the marketing of them has been extremely effective,'' Blake said. ''Before the
educational campaign, AIDS had been increasing rapidly, but now it has
stabilized at 6 to 7 percent of population for the last three years.'' Yet Blake
and other experts admit that education has yet to signficantly slow the sprea d
of AIDS on a global scale. One problem is that governments often fail to sustain
their educational programs on how to avoid AIDS infection. Once that happens,
rates of infection rise, they say.  In some nations bordering Zaire where
education has been spotty at best, as many as one in three residents may be
infected with HIV.  The lack of sustained educational programs affects the
United States as well as Third World nations, experts say. In some ways, the
AIDS epidemic in this country is beginning to resemble the way the disease is
spreading worldwide - especially in inner cities and low-income rural areas,
doctors say.  Health officials here and elsewhere in the United States gave
these statistics to reveal disturbing new trends in the AIDS epidemic: There is
a parallel between U.S. and Third World nations, where AIDS is now devastating
poverty areas. In recent years, the fastest-growing number of HIV infections has
been among blacks, many of whom live in poor areas of the inner cities.  The
rate of new HIV infections among heterosexuals is growing slowly but steadily.
Nationwide, heterosexuals are lulled into complacency because only actual AIDS
cases, not infections, are reported.  Unlike the global AIDS epidemic, the total
number of new AIDS cases annually in the United States has leveled off a bit in
the last two years. But these figures are misleading, experts here say.  Dr.
William G. Powderly directs clinical trials of experimental AIDS drugs at
Washington University Medical School. ''A great issue that rarely comes across -
not even in the Magic Johnson revelation - is the big difference between AIDS
and new infections of HIV,'' he said.  ''It takes about 10 years for AIDS
symptoms to develop after a recent HIV infection, but in all the publicity about
Johnson, the media kept referring to the current AIDS incidence among
heterosexuals as being only 2 to 3 percent (of all people infected with AIDS).
''But the truth is that 7 to 10 percent of new HIV infections are among
heterosexuals - much higher than we expected. In five years, nearly 12 percent
of all AIDS cases will be heterosexuals.'' Another issue that isn't widely
acknowledged is the recent and rapid growth of AIDS and HIV infections among
blacks, Powderly said.  ''So far in 1992, 30.7 percent of AIDS cases in Missouri
have occurred among blacks, and 36.5 percent of new HIV positive tests were
among blacks (11 percent of the state's population is black). So a
disproportionate number of blacks are being infected here, and the same trend is
going on throughout the United States.  ''We don't have the incredibly
out-of-control spread that's happening in Africa and Asia, but the epidemic is
getting worse in the United States.'' As far as diagnosed AIDS cases are
concerned, ''the epidemic is leveling off, but there are 100,000 new HIV
infections each year in the United States - if this rate keeps up, the situation
could be similar to TB at the turn of the century,'' Powderly said.  ''Sure as
hell, AIDS is not being controlled well. The Centers for Disease Control
projects that by 1994, AIDS will be the leading cause of death in men in the
20-44 age group, and by the end of the decade it will be the leading cause of
death among women in that age group.'' Dr. William C. Banton II, chairman of the
Missouri Advisory Committee for the Elimination of Tuberculosis, agreed. ''In
the early 1900s, TB was overwhelming, and AIDS will be the same if it continues
at current rates, '' he said.  Banton pointed out that TB was much more easily
spread - by invisible, airborne droplets coughed up by people with the disease.
''With HIV and AIDS, however, someone has to do something much more directly,
such as have sexual intercourse with an infected individual, or be stuck with a
needle contaminated with the AIDS virus.'' Ironically, TB is one of several
''opportunistic'' illnesses that infect AIDS patients. In addition, more TB is
occurring nationwide because of the large homeless population - making
eradication of TB a more distant goal.  With no curative medicines or vaccines
for AIDS, the key to curbing the epidemic is changing specific behavior, said
WHO's Blake.  ''No matter whether you are in developing nations or the United
States, AIDS will touch all sectors, poor and rich, as long as people are
practicing unprotected sex and abusing intravenous drugs,'' Blake said.  Another
major focus in preventing AIDS is to seek out and treat people with other
sexually transmitted diseases, such as genital warts, syphilis, genital herpes
and chlamydia, she said. Individuals with such venereal diseases are about 10
times more likely to contract AIDS if they have sexual relations with someone
infected with HIV, she said. One reason is that the skin lesions of these
diseases are additional ways by which HIV can be transmitted.  ''If health
services make sure these people are treated (for their venereal diseases), 95
percent of them can be cured with drugs and they also can be educated about how
to avoid HIV infection,'' she said.  Two reasons AIDS is spreading rapidly in
Africa is that many people have the above venereal diseases and many
impoverished women sell sex in order to feed their hungry children, Blake said.
East central Africa has the greatest rate of infection - an estimated one in
five individuals is carrying HIV, she said. ''In Africa, actual AIDS cases total
about 1 million men and women and about 500,000 children,'' she said.  Only
rough estimates exist for Latin America and Asia because HIV infections have
mushroomed there in recent years, Blake said. ''In only the last two or three
years, we estimate there are 1 million HIV infections in Latin America and
another 1 million in Southeast Asia. That's a frighteningly rapid buildup of
infections in areas of the world that have 40 percent of the world's
population,'' she said.  ''Unfortunately,'' says Dr. Linda A. Fisher, chief
medical officer for the St. Louis County health department, ''some Americans
find it easier to worry about AIDS infections in distant countries, but the fact
is that AIDS continues to be a significant problem in the St. Louis area.  ''Of
course our situation remains somewhat different than in Third World nations,
where poverty is more extensive. But this year we've seen an explosion of 850
cases of syphilis in St. Louis and St. Louis County - compared to only 100 cases
five years ago. We look at this statisic and realize that people aren't limiting
their sexual activity, despite all the publicity. Because of the ongoing crack
cocaine epidemic, people are exchanging sex for drugs. So both syphilis and HIV
are being spread for these reasons.'' In the St. Louis area through May 6, there
have been 1,070 AIDS cases and another 2,000 positive HIV tests, she said. These
are cumulative numbers, compiled since the first AIDS reports in 1982, and since
HIV tests were reported here two years ago. Missouri is one of the few states
that report positive HIV tests, and the federal Centers for Disease Control has
a rough estimate that 1 million Americans are infected with HIV.  ''We have no
reason to be complacent,'' Fisher said. ''Based on federal studies, I estimate
that three out of every 1,000 residents in the St.  Louis area are HIV
positive.''

THE LANGUAGE OF AIDS CONFUSION ABOUNDS,LINGUIST DISCOVERS

BYLINE: Robert Manor Of the Post-Dispatch Staff

SECTION: EVERYDAY MAGAZINE; Pg. 1D

LENGTH: 1854 words


A MEDICAL linguist at the University of Illinois says that the public's view of
AIDS is a shifting mosaic largely formed by jargon, prejudice and euphemism,
much of it perpetuated by public health officials, physicians and the media.
The linguist, Paula Treichler, says perceptions about AIDS can have an impact on
policy.  ''The way that you talk about something can influence how you respond
to it in material terms,'' she said in a recent interview.  Among the factors
complicating understanding of AIDS are racism, sexism, hatred of homosexuals,
and a generally held revulsion toward people who inject drugs, says Treichler,
who has several appointments in departments at the Champaign-Urbana campus and
is studying under a fellowship at Cornell University.  Treichler said AIDS is
generating diverse meanings at an extraordinary pace. In a recently published
article, she cited a variety of meanings of AIDS as given by different sources:
According to Sen. Jesse Helms, AIDS is a creation of the media, which have
sensationalized a minor health problem for their own profit and pleasure.  (The
federal Centers for Disease Control says 50,000 people in this country have died
of AIDS.) According to one science writer, AIDS is an unstoppable ''Andromeda
strain'' with the transmission efficiency of the common cold. (All medical
authorities agree the AIDS virus cannot be transmitted by casual contact, as
colds and influenza are.) According to a Haitian political organization, AIDS is
an imperialist plot to destroy the Third World. (The greatest number of reported
AIDS cases are in the United States, says the World Health Organization; the
disease is prevalent in Haiti and Africa but rare in Asia.) According to a
Kenyan newspaper, AIDS is a capitalist scheme to create new markets for
pharmaceutical products. (The drugs used to treat AIDS and its complications are
so expensive they're limited primarily to wealthy Western countries.) According
to a popular science magazine, AIDS is the price of anal intercourse, but
vaginal intercourse presents little danger. (Research in the United States and
Africa has shown the AIDS virus can be transmitted by vaginal intercourse.) In
all, Treicher has identified 38 different meanings people have attached to AIDS.
''You hardly ever get to see that happening right before your eyes,'' she said.
''It is a whole series of metaphors. Its meaning is very diverse.  ''One effect
is that it helps explain why, when people are given what seem to be simple
messages, they don't immediately change their behavior. They don't seem to
understand. If you want to do an educational campaign, you have to take into
account that people are hearing things on different channels.'' For example, the
writer for the science magazine suggested that heterosexuals were at little risk
because the vagina was inhospitable to the AIDS virus while the anus was much
more vulnerable. The author suggested that AIDS is ''largely the fatal price one
can pay for anal intercourse'' and that heterosexuals had little to fear.  It
was a reassuring theory, at least for heterosexuals who don't have anal
intercourse.  It also was untrue. Female infection through vaginal intercourse
is an established fact. More than 2,000 American women have been infected by
AIDS - the majority of them now dead.  Treichler says that the perceived role of
women in the transmission of the AIDS virus is distorted. Despite the fact that
women and men in Africa are developing AIDS in equal numbers, the scientific
literature describes women as ''incompetent'' transmitters of the virus, unless,
as Treichler puts it, the women are: Prostitutes, who are regarded ''as so
contaminated that their bodies are virtually laboratory cultures for viral
replication.'' African, ''whose exotic bodies, sexual practices or who knows
what are seen to be so radically different from those of women in the U.S. that
anything can happen in them.'' Health authorities are responsible for some of
the replicating meanings of AIDS, Treichler says.  Experts at health
departments, for example, have urged people ''not to share body fluids.'' The
phraseology was, perhaps, chosen for reasons of prudery. Health officials may
have felt uncomfortable talking about semen, one of only two body fluids known
to transmit the AIDS virus. The only other way AIDS can be transmitted is
through the exchange of blood contaminated with the virus.  But the public was
left with the impression that sweat, tears and saliva pose a risk. There are no
documented cases of infection from these fluids.  The imprecision of language
and multiplying perceptions of AIDS inevitably find their way into the popular
press, Treichler said.  One paragraph in a story published in a major
metropolitan daily read: ''So far, there has been no indication that AIDS is
spreading explosively among the general heterosexual population. But the story
is different among poor people who live amid rampant drug addiction.'' ''That's
a bizarre distinction,'' Treichler said.  She noted that the writer was saying -
wit h no accuracy - that poor people are not part of the general population,
that the general population is heterosexual in makeup, and that people who live
in the vicinity of drug addicts are apt to become infected.  Treichler also
objects when newspapers, including the Post-Dispatch, refer in headlines to ''
AIDS victims.'' Some others agree that the term ''AIDS victims'' is a pejorative
cliche.  Jody Powell, former White House press secretary, recently wrote that
''people with AIDS are not victims; they are people struggling to live normal
lives in the face of a fatal disease.'' And the Names Project, which seeks to
memorialize the names of people who have died of AIDS, says that the term ''AIDS
victims'' is dehumanizing.  ''More than that, the use of the word 'victim'
creates the false impression that people with AIDS are distinct from everybody
else,'' according to the Names Project in a recent statement.  In her writings,
Treichler says perceptions differ about AIDS because of the medical
establishment's use of the term ''risk groups.'' Homosexuals and intravenous
drug users, for example, are defined by the federal Centers for Disease Control
as being groups at risk of developing AIDS. For heterosexuals, the perception is
that they are not affected by AIDS - that it's happening to someone else.
Actually, homosexuals are at no risk whatsoever of infection if they do not
engage in unsafe sex. People who inject themselves with drugs are not in danger
of AIDS - if they never share a syringe and never have unsafe sex.  And
everyone, from the celibate to the newborn, can be profoundly affected by AIDS.
Treichler cites statistics that homosexuals, drug injectors, hemophiliacs and
their lovers total an estimated 10 million people in the United States.  That is
one out of every 25 people in the country. When heterosexuals who engage in
risky sexual behavior are added, the number rises even higher.  Separation of
those said to be in high-risk groups from those in the general population ''is
no longer possible,'' Treichler concluded.

2 Hospitals May Start AIDS Units;
Inpatient Facilities Would Be 1st in D.C.

BYLINE: Michael Abramowitz, Washington Post Staff Writer

SECTION: METRO; PAGE C1

LENGTH: 898 words


Two of Washington's largest teaching hospitals are considering setting up what
would be the area's first inpatient units specializing in care for AIDS
patients, hospital officials have disclosed.

Officials at George Washington University Medical Center and at Washington
Hospital Center said the proposals to centralize activities dealing with
acquired immune deficiency syndrome could improve treatment of patients and
raise the quality of medical student education. The Washington area ranks fifth
in the nation in reported AIDS cases, according to federal statistics.

The two hospitals, the area's largest providers of AIDS care, now treat AIDS
patients in rooms scattered throughout the institutions. Under the proposals,
centralized AIDS units would be established with specially trained teams of
nurses and health care workers.

However, Michael M. Barch, administrator of the 501-bed GWU facility, and Dunlop
Ecker, president of the 851-bed Washington Hospital Center, indicated that final
decisions on the proposed AIDS units will not be made for several months, and
said the hospitals may eventually reject the idea.

The issue has set off intense debate at the hospitals. Several factors weigh
against the concept, administrators and physicians said, including the
difficulty of adequately staffing any AIDS unit and the potential for health
care workers to "burn out" from the high stress involved in caring for patients
with the fatal disease.

In addition, sources said, hospital administrators fear that the two
institutions might become stigmatized as "AIDS hospitals" -- a label that could
drive away patients and staff members.

"Most people in my field think it is a good idea," said Dr. John G. Bartlett, an
infectious-disease specialist who directs an AIDS unit at Johns Hopkins Hospital
in Baltimore. "The people who think this is a bad idea are people in hospital
administrations who don't want the publicity of AIDS associated with the
institution."

Bartlett said that by establishing AIDS units, hospitals invite possible
lawsuits, anxiety among other patients and potential adverse publicity. "A lot
of them feel that it is better to keep a low profile," he said.

Dr. Gary Simon, assistant chairman of GWU's department of medicine, said he
favors establishing an AIDS unit, but said, "One of the downsides is being
identified as the place all patients go -- we can't have that."

"That would be detrimental to the primary goal of this hospital," Simon said.
"This is a teaching hospital" -- one where, he said, students must learn about
caring for a wide range of diseases, not just AIDS.

AIDS units in other cities have had mixed results. San Francisco General
Hospital has a national reputation for compassionate, quality AIDS care at its
inpatient unit. Several New York hospitals have highly regarded AIDS units.

But in Houston, a widely publicized AIDS hospital was forced to stop accepting
new patients last year after it was overwhelmed by patients who had no insurance
to cover their medical bills.

With an AIDS unit, doctors say, health care workers are likely to recognize
illnesses associated with the disease earlier, and head off potential
complications that require lengthy hospitalization.

"When you specialize, you're going to have a greater concentration of knowledge
and experience," Barch said. "The assumption . . . is that the outcome is a
higher quality of patient care."

Simon said that grouping patients in one part of the hospital should make it
easier for researchers to carry out clinical tests of potential AIDS drugs.

Another benefit would be the creation of teams of health care workers who are
eager, rather than reluctant, to work with AIDS patients, doctors said. "There's
a lot of nurses who don't want to work with AIDS," said Dr. Peter Hawley,
medical director of the Whitman-Walker Clinic, a D.C. facility that provides
testing and outpatient services for AIDS patients.

At the end of 1987, GWU had recorded 290 admissions of AIDS patients from the
District, and Washington Hospital Center had reported 174, according to Dr.
Martin E. Levy, head of the city's Preventive Health Services Administration. On
any day, there are usually about 20 AIDS patients at each facility.

A total of 1,057 AIDS cases have been reported in Washington, and roughly 700
have been reported in the Virginia and Maryland suburbs, Levy said. D.C. General
Hospital, the area's third-largest provider of AIDS care, has recorded 70
admissions of AIDS patients from the District.

Hospital administrators express concern about possible difficulties in staffing
any AIDS unit at a time of severe personnel shortages in health care, especially
among nurses. Officials also said they would have to develop counseling programs
and take other measures to make sure that workers in an AIDS unit would not
become emotionally drained.

"There's no doubt that nurses burn out on oncology units if certain things
aren't done," said Dr. Jeffrey S. Akman, a GWU psychiatrist who specializes in
educating health care workers about AIDS. "Clearly the possibility of burnout
exists" in an AIDS unit, he said.

But, Akman said, health care workers in AIDS units may be more motivated than
regular staff members. "They will want to work there," he said. "You will not be
dealing with health care workers who are anxious, resentful or homophobic."

Justice minister accused of not using her sway to help gays

BYLINE: KEVIN GRIFFIN; VANSUN

SECTION:  Pg. B2

LENGTH: 391 words


Federal Justice Minister Kim Campbell has failed to use her political influence
in cabinet to help protect lesbians and gays, an AIDS rally was told Monday.

Speaking at Robson Square in Campbell's riding of Vancouver Centre, Mark Mees,
executive director of AIDS Vancouver, also told a crowd of about 125 that he has
grown angry at what he said was federal inaction on renewing a national AIDS
strategy that expires next year.

"Kim Campbell has repeatedly stated that she supports the basic intent of the
national AIDS strategy and the human rights issues which are integral to the
effort against AIDS," he said in an interview afterward.

"She says she is going to introduce legislation protecting gays and lesbians and
then it is delayed again. I'm angry and I do feel that we're caught in these
political games that are being played."

Ottawa currently spends $ 37 million a year on its national AIDS strategy, first
introduced in 1987. Money goes toward everything from community prevention and
education programs to research.

But AIDS groups say Progressive Conservative politicians are telling them work
on a new national AIDS strategy - the existing one expires on March 31, 1993 -
will have to wait until after the constitutional referendum on Oct. 26.

Similar Action Against AIDS rallies were held in cities across the country to
launch a national petition drive and the beginning of AIDS Awareness Week.

Mees estimated that the worst is yet to come in the AIDS health crisis, with up
to 10,000 persons in B.C. already testing positive for HIV, the virus linked to
AIDS.

"The situation in B.C. is like a time bomb," Mees told the crowd.

Lauro de Haan, rally organizer and member of the Persons With AIDS Society,
called on the federal government to show leadership in dealing with AIDS by
increasing money for:

* Community-level care, prevention and support.

* Participation in clinical drug trials.

* Development of a national AIDS information system to ensure everyone has
access to the most up to date AIDS treatment news.

* A coordinated research approach to HIV and AIDS so Canada's efforts do not
duplicate efforts in other countries.

* A Canadian response to the international pandemic in countries where the per
capita spending on health care exceeds what most Canadians spend for lunch.

AIDS Policy Coodinator Named by Mayor Dinkins

SECTION: Section B; Page 3; Column 5; Metropolitan Desk

LENGTH: 694 words


Acknowledging that New York City needs to do more for people with AIDS, Mayor
David N. Dinkins yesterday appointed Ronald S. Johnson, a well-known advocate
for AIDS causes, to the new position of city coordinator for AIDS policy.

Mr. Johnson, who is executive director of the Minority Task Force on AIDS and a
frequent critic of the city's policies on AIDS, said publicly for the first time
yesterday that he has tested positive for the virus that causes the disease.

"I am H.I.V.-positive and that helps shape who I am particularly in response to
this epidemic," said the 44-year-old Mr. Johnson, who is openly gay. "I felt
that it was important to let people know that that's who I am as I approach this
city job."

'Greater Sensitivity'

Mayor Dinkins said that he did not know that Mr. Johnson was H.I.V.-positive
before yesterday. "I knew that he was gay but I didn't know he was
H.I.V.-positive, and had I known I would have leaped more quickly to make the
appointment," Mr. Dinkins said. "He has greater sensitivity and greater concern
to these issues."

City advocates for people with AIDS, who for years have sought the appointment
of a top city official to represent their interests, applauded the Mayor's
selection of Mr. Johnson, whom they described as a "forceful and persuasive
advocate."

"This city is such a huge bureaucracy that it needs one official whose sole
focus is AIDS," said Debra Fraser-Howze, executive director of the Black
Leadership Commission on AIDS, a nonprofit group. "AIDS services both inside and
outside city government have not been coordinated effectively and that's why we
need someone like Ron Johnson."

But some advocates questioned whether Mr. Johnson could have an impact on city
policies because as coordinator, he will have no direct control over the city's
budget for AIDS programs. They said they viewed his appointment as a symbolic
gesture.

'No Real Power'

"There is no substance to the appointment of an AIDS czar who has no real
power," said William K. Dobbs, a member of Act Up, an advocacy group known for
its disruptive protests. "It makes one wonder if the Mayor is only doing this in
response to his good friend Arthur Ashe getting AIDS."

Mr. Dinkins's appointment of a city AIDS coordinator follows by one day Mr.
Ashe's announcement that he had contracted AIDS through a blood transfusion. Mr.
Dinkins stood next to Mr. Ashe when he made the announcement.

The Mayor said that Mr. Ashe's revelation had not influenced his decision to
appoint an AIDS coordinator. Similarly, Mr. Johnson said that Mr. Ashe's
announcement had not prompted him to disclose that he has the virus that causes
AIDS.

Advocates like Mr. Dobbs say that the city has failed to address serious
problems in its AIDS programs, including delays in the city's AIDS hotline and
testing program, a stalled needle-exchange program and poor housing and medical
care for AIDS patients.

Asked to cite examples of poor coordination among city AIDS programs, Mr.
Johnson declined yesterday, saying that he would rather wait until he has had a
chance to study the issues.

As AIDS coordinator, Mr. Johnson will oversee the city's AIDS policies and
activities at its various health agencies and hospitals. He will also be
chairman of the HIV Health and Human Services Planning Council, which
distributes Federal AIDS money. Mr. Johnson, who will be paid $66,000 a year,
will report to the Deputy Mayor for Health and Human Services, Cesar A. Perales.

"I don't have time to concentrate on this epidemic and I need someone working
very closely with me who understands the issues and who will be able to lead the
fight and that's why we brought on Ron," Mr. Perales said.

A long-time advocate for people with AIDS, Mr. Johnson has served as director of
the nonprofit Minority Task Force on AIDS since 1988. From 1982 to 1988, he was
assistant executive director of the University Settlement, a nonprofit
social-service program.

A graduate of City College, Mr. Johnson received a master's degree in psychology
from Harvard. He lives in Brooklyn and has a 23-year-old son, Jeffrey, who is a
public safety officer.

The fear of living dangerously

BYLINE: Jaya Balendra

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 8

THE day after Earvin "Magic" Johnson told the world he had AIDS, shares in
leading US condom manufacturers and companies researching AIDS treatment
skyrocketed.

The reaction is testimony to the fear that the AIDS epidemic has instilled and
the increasing legitimacy of the industries that are fighting it.

Ten years after the first AIDS death was recorded, a multi-billion-dollar
industry has emerged. Since 1984, the Federal Government has boosted its
expenditure on AIDS from $5million to $183million this year.

Such a quantum leap in spending has angered groups such as the the Australian
Medical Association, which recently called for a review of AIDS funding,
claiming the disease has received preferential treatment over illnesses like
heart disease and cancer.

But the Government and AIDS groups say the expenditure and high-profile, often
controversial, advertising campaigns have helped stem the spread of HIV
infection which can lead to AIDS. In Australia the disease has been essentially
contained within the homosexual community, where it was first discovered in the
Western world.

The federal Health Department's figures show that 15,000 people _ fewer than one
in 1000 _ have been infected and only 10 per cent of those have developed AIDS.

Eighty-one per cent of those who are HIV-positive are homosexual men, 3.4 per
cent injecting drug users and three per cent heterosexuals.

According to the National AIDS Register, 1820 people have died from AIDS in
Australia including 370 deaths in Victoria.

According to the Victorian Health Department's project manager for AIDS and
sexually transmitted diseases, Mr Phil Carswell: "We actually are the only
country in the world where the level of infection is dropping.

We were fifth, now we are eighth ... But the problem is we are always behind in
the fight. There is no blueprint for AIDS. If that was the case I would have
bottled it, sold it and made a fortune." Pacific Dunlop's Ansell International,
one of the world's biggest producers of latex medical gloves and condoms, was
among the first to realise that there was money in AIDS.

A spokeswoman for Ansell said that while demand for both products surged after
Rock Hudson's death in 1985, the market has since flattened out.

Federal Health Department figures show that following the launch of a national
condom campaign in 1989, sales rose from 2.7 million units to 3.2 million this
year.

However, condom sales in the US have increased by 25 per cent after a spate of
AIDS-related deaths. Sales of condoms and medical gloves (widely used because of
AIDS) account for about 35 per cent of Ansell's $600million worth of annual
sales worldwide.

AIDS has also given rise to a substantial increase in medical negligence claims.
A leading firm of solicitors, Slater and Gordon, is acting for 70 people with
AIDS acquired after blood transfusions.

The claimants, mostly haemophiliacs who received contaminated blood around 1984,
are alleging negligence in that health authorities were aware of the risk of
AIDS at that time.

In Victoria the State Government faces a pay-out bill of more than $100 million
following lawsuits by 120 patients who contracted the HIV virus through blood
transfusions.

Arguably one of the biggest winners from the AIDS epidemic has been the US
pharmaceutical company Burroughs Wellcome, the maker of AZT, the only drug
company licensed to treat the AIDS virus. With estimated profits of between
$US25 million and $US100 million, the company has been branded an "AIDS
profiteer" by people with AIDS and health professionals in the US and Australia.

One Health Department source told `The Sunday Age': "AZT manufacturers are
making heaps of money through inflated prices of around $10,000 per patient.
They are doing it to recover their research and development costs, but they have
done that 10 times over in California alone." AIDS looms as a problem for
insurance companies which have been forced to "underwrite" the disease.

So far, member companies of the Life Insurance Federation of Australia, which
include many of Australia's largest insurers, had paid out nearly $32 million in
AIDS-related death and disability claims on 730 claims by June this year.

The executive director of the federation, Mr David Purchase, said AIDS was a
significant problem for the industry although there had been fewer AIDS-related
deaths than the industry earlier predicted. He said life offices were not
"squirrelling" away money for AIDS, but were putting aside appropriate sums to
cover future payouts.

Earlier estimates of AIDS-related deaths sparked predictions that unless a way
was found to curb AIDS-related claims, life insurance premiums for the entire
population would soar.

On the preventive side, the business of educating people about "safe sex" is
particularly expensive.

For instance, spending under the Federal Government's National HIV-AIDS Strategy
on education alone has increased from $500,000 in 1984-85 to about $8.5 million
this year.

Earlier this year AIDS and STD kits were issued to all Victorian state schools.

Health workers, prison inmates, school teachers and students, prostitutes,
sportsmen and even scouts are all being educated about the disease.

But according to Mr Carswell, who was promoting "safe sex" long before it became
a catch cry, the message is failing to reach the people who are most at risk.

"Our major problem at the moment is trying to reach those men who have sex with
other men who don't identify themselves as gay, who don't go to a gay bar and
wouldn't pick up a magazine with the word `gay' on it," he said.

The Goverment's latest $750,000 anti-AIDS initiative is aimed at Australian
travellers "who mix a little pleasure with business".

The campaign is aimed at two million travellers expected to visit Australia next
year as well as Australians going overseas, particularly to South-East Asia. It
involves posters and brochures at bus terminals, youth hostels, tourism offices
and billboards at airports throughout Australia. The department is also
negotiating with airlines to screen a "travel safe" video.

But changing sexual behavior is extremely difficult.

"Sharing needles or having sex is a completely private thing. The Government
can't put cameras in people's bedrooms. There is no legislation that can be

LEARNING TO DEAL WITH AIDS AT WORK

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER

SECTION: Section 11WC; Page 18, Column 3; Westchester Weekly Desk

LENGTH: 1243 words


''THE first time I realized he had an AIDS-related illness is when I went to
visit him in the hospital,'' said the president of a manufacturing company in
lower Westchester, referring to one of his clerical employees. ''Two weeks
later, he was able to come back to work. However, due to a company restructuring
that took place before he went to the hospital, he works on the night shift,
alone, so I really don't know how our other employees would have felt about
working side-by-side with him in the office.

''They don't seem hostile, but my guess is that some of them would have treated
him like a pariah,'' the executive continued. ''People are so terrified of AIDS
that they act irrationally. As an employer, facing human concerns and a
magnitude of medical and legal problems brought on by the AIDS epidemic, I'm
extremely worried. My fear is that we're just beginning to see the tip of the
iceberg in the work place.''

His fears and the fears of many other employers came under scrutiny at a recent
conference on AIDS that was presented by United Hospital and held in White
Plains. ''If you don't have cases of AIDS yet,'' one participant warned, ''just
wait - you'll have some by tomorrow.''

The representatives of 100 Westchester companies heard one panelist, Dr. Leon J.
Warshaw, fault companies that ignored the serious implications of AIDS in the
workplace. Dr. Warshaw, executive director of the New York Business Group on
Health, an industry-labor coalition that was a co-sponsor of the conference,
referred to AIDS as a catastrophic illness and advised companies to gird for an
AIDS epidemic. He recommended that they develop corporate policies to deal with
such issues as adequate medical coverage and the legal rights of employees who
have AIDS.

Misconceptions about the disease, Dr. Warshaw said, exist among both employers
and employees. ''AIDS is hard to catch, you have to go out of your way to get
it,'' he said. However, he added, the irrational fear that spreads through a
company when a worker has AIDS amounts to paranoia.

''Employers contributed by insisting on secrecy in their dealings with employees
with AIDS, out of fear that if they acknowledge that any of their employees have
the disease, they may lose customers,'' Dr. Warshaw said. He advised employers
to change their own attitudes and to conduct education and information courses
on AIDS for their employees. When another panelist, Gavin R. Kerr, director of
managed health care at MONY Financial Services in Purchase, asked the audience
how many companies represented at the conference had employees with AIDS, a
dozen hands went up.

Describing AIDS as one of the most cruel and painful diseases known, Mr. Kerr
said it also inflicted a staggering financial toll on the nation. A recent study
by the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta and cited by Mr. Kerr estimated
that the AIDS epidemic so far had drained more than $4.1 billion from the
American economy, including costs of $832 million for health care and research
and indirect costs of $3.26 billion because of lost productivity and the
premature deaths of workers.

Employers were advised by Mr. Kerr to develop a comprehensive managed
health-care and cost-management program that could control costs not only in the
AIDS effort but also in other health-care areas - including lung cancer, which
accounts for $1.6 billion in yearly outlays. The key step in the AIDS-management
program, Mr. Kerr told his audience, is to ''demand a lot of your insurance
company.''

He also suggested that employers establish education programs that emphasize
being well, that they encourage employees to seek early detection of AIDS
(allowing time for assessment of a variety of treatment-plan options) and that
they be aware of alternatives to hospitalization, such as hospices and home
care. ''We have 9,000 employees in our own company,'' Mr. Kerr said. ''And some
of them have AIDS. From our own experience we found that when the disease is
diagnosed early and treatment begins in the early stages, medical costs can be
kept down.''

Under the law, the rights of workers with AIDS are protected. It is illegal to
discriminate against employees with AIDS, warned one speaker, Robert A. Wild, a
lawyer. ''You can't fire an employee because he has AIDS,'' he said. ''You can
fire an employee with AIDS for bad job performance, but it is tough to prove bad
performance is not discrimination in such cases.''

As for screening prospective employees for the AIDS virus, it is legal but
impractical, Mr. Wild said, because ''if a job applicant is informed and
consents, blood tests for AIDS are permissible; but even if the results are
positive, the company cannot reject the applicant on the basis of the tests.''

Judging from the comments from the audience, most of the company representatives
were at the conference to learn how as employers to deal with AIDS.

Richard Snyder, vice president of human resources for Bank America in Manhattan,
said his company, with 60,000 employees nationwide, set guidelines for dealing
with life-threatening diseases, including AIDS, in 1983. ''Employees with AIDS
are covered under our normal medical insurance,'' Mr. Syder said. ''Employees
with AIDS-related diseases are encouraged to continue as long as their work
performance is acceptable and their health is not a threat to others. We
strongly believe in education and run seminars for employees on a regular
basis.''

Jane K. Ryan, the health administrator for Nestle's Foods U.S.A. in Purchase,
said: ''As of this moment we haven't had a case of AIDS among our 1,100-employee
population, but our intent is to treat it just like any other serious illness
that is covered under our medical-benefits plan. We have several education
programs on AIDS and answer employee questions that clarify our policy and that
provide employees with the most current information on the disease.''

The 2,900 employees at General Foods facilities in White Plains, Rye Brook and
Tarrytown, said Dr. Clyde H. Wilson, director of Westchester Health Service of
General Foods, are also adequately covered for serious illnesses. ''We have no
corporate policy on AIDS,'' Dr. Wilson said. ''We feel our benefits are
structured so that we cover everything that needs to be covered.''

Asked if General Foods had considered pre-employment testing for AIDS, Dr.
Wilson said: ''I can't conceive of a set of circumstances when we would do such
testing. We have developed several educational programs that present the basic
facts about the illness.''

Employee programs on AIDS are available from the Westchester chapter of the Red
Cross. Owen M. Borda, coordinator of AIDS education for the American Red Cross,
said that the Westchester chapter, a co-sponsor of the conference, would also
train company representatives as on-site AIDS specialists in two days of
intensive seminars. Key individuals at each worksite who are trained and
knowledgeable in current AIDS information, Mr. Borda said, should be available
to employees to answer questions, provide information and act as a referral
source.

''As in the tuberculosis and swine flu epidemics of recent history, the Red
Cross is prepared to work closely with the business community to develop
programs to meet local need in combating this latest health emergency,'' Mr.
Borda said.

Other sponsors of the conference were the Wellness Council of Westchester and
the Westchester County Association.

AIDS: BELLEVUE TRIES TO COPE WITH DISEASE IT CANNOT CURE

BYLINE: By RONALD SULLIVAN

SECTION: Section A; Page 1, Column 5; National Desk

LENGTH: 3508 words


The AIDS epidemic has transformed Bellevue Hospital Center to such an extent
that the fatal disorder of the immune system is now the municipal hospital's
single most common medical diagnosis.

Although the fear of contagion that initially gripped the hospital has abated in
recent months, Bellevue still faces the grim reality of treating a disorder it
cannot cure and accommodating itself to large numbers of deaths it cannot
prevent.

While soaring costs are a major concern, the numbing realization that nothing
can be done to prevent the fatal course of AIDS is inflicting mounting emotional
casualties on Bellevue's medical and nursing staff.

'The Cost Is Staggering'

Moreover, the prospect of treating twice as many AIDS patients next year is
having a devastating impact on doctors and nurses who can barely cope with
current caseloads.

''The cost is staggering, the grief is overwhelming, and there is no end in
sight,'' said Dr. Fred Valentine, a Bellevue physician.

Because so much of what happens in a hospital occurs behind a drawn curtain, a
closed door or within the frenetic confines of an intensive care unit, the
atmosphere at Bellevue appears unchanged.

'Devastating' Stress

The hospital's elevators, emergency rooms and clinics are as busy and as crowded
as usual, and the quiet bustle on the medical and surgical floors seems the same
as ever.

But Bellevue's appearance is misleading, said Dorothy Shayan, the director of
nursing.

''We are losing large numbers of young men and children to this disease, and the
psychological and emotional stress on everyone is devastating,'' she said.
''Patients die in hospitals; we know that. But never before like this.''

As a result, AIDS, acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is redefining the way
Bellevue doctors and nurses confront death and a ravaging terminal illness.

Bellevue, the country's oldest public hospital and world famous for its 250
years of medical and surgical achievements, is where young doctors are trained
to do everything they can to keep life going. Now, however, there is a growing
emphasis on allowing AIDS patients to forgo heroic measures and die with as much
dignity as possible.

The greatest changes at Bellevue have occurred in the 200-bed department of
medicine, where every fourth patient is an AIDS victim. The department accounts
for about a fourth of the hospital's 850 patients, including those in the
surgical, obstetric, pediatric and psychiatric departments.

Because AIDS patients require so much care and because their isolation creates
so many problems, Bellevue has just rearranged its medical service and created a
10-bed AIDS unit on the 12th floor, where sicker patients will be treated.

However, most AIDS patients will remain on the general medical floors, most of
them one to a room.

Although there has been no reported case thus far of a nurse, doctor or hospital
worker contracting AIDS on the job, there are still certain risks.

For example, 20 staff members at Bellevue have thus far suffered accidental
needle punctures from syringes used on AIDS patients. They are being closely
monitored to see if any of them contracts the disorder.

Dr. Robert Holzman, a Bellevue specialist in infectious disease and an expert on
AIDS, said the chances of contracting AIDS from a needle puncture ''are
extremely small; the odds are more than a 100 to 1.''

Camille Caracappa, a 23-year-old nurse, knows the odds. But she stuck her finger
accidentally on Dec. 3 with a syringe she had just used on an AIDS patient, she
said she quickly forgot the odds favored her.

''In an instant, all I could feel was a wave of fear,'' she said in an interview
on Bellevue's 16th floor, where many of the hospital's AIDS patients are
treated. On a wall behind her was a sign that said: ''The Only Difference
Between This Place and the Titanic Is . . . They Had a Band!'' A New Distinction
For Bellevue Bellevue, the city's pre-eminent municipal hospital and a major
teaching affiliate of the New York University Medical Center, has always enjoyed
being first in a number of ways - first in providing emergency medical and
psychiatric care, first in microsurgery and reattaching severed limbs and first
in training new doctors and nurses.

It is now first in AIDS, treating more of its victims than any other hospital in
the country.

On any given day, Bellevue - a large, 25-story modern hospital with 1,195 beds
amid a complex of outmoded 19th-century buildings on First Avenue at 26th Street
- has about 50 or so AIDS patients, most of them members of the two major risk
groups - intravenous drug users or homosexual men.

Bellevue's pediatric service also treats on any given day about five babies or
young children with AIDS, most of whom have contracted the disease from their
mothers.

In comparison, San Fransisco General Hospital, the major AIDS hospital in that
city, has about 29 AIDS patients on any given day.

Health officials estimate that about 300 AIDS patients are hospitalized in New
York City - half of them in municipal hospitals and half in the city's private
hospitals.

Before AIDS became epidemic, the most common diagnoses among Bellevue's 850
patients were psychiatric disorders, asthma and traumatic injuries. All told,
Bellevue has treated more than 400 AIDS patients this year, many of whom died
either in the hospital or soon after being discharged.

Thus far, 15,403 cases of AIDS have been reported nationally since the disorder
was first identified in 1981, almost a third of them here.

Federal health officials say they expect 6,000 new AIDS cases in this country to
be reported by the end of this year and twice as many next year.

Thus far, more than half of AIDS patients have died from the diseases and
infections that overwhelm the body as a result of a complete breakdown of the
immune system. AIDS, a viral disorder, is regarded as ultimately fatal in
virtually every case, usually within a year after the first hospitalization.

Ronald B. Milch, Bellevue's new executive director, said the increasing AIDS
caseload constituted a ''a medical and economic crisis.''

He said Bellevue receives $460 a day from the city for each patient, most of
whom have no hospital insurance. This is because the majority of AIDS patients
at Bellevue are drug users who have come ''off the street'' or from Rikers
Island, or homosexuals who have exhausted what private hospital coverage they
had.

But Mr. Milch said it costs almost $900 a day for each AIDS patient, and the
growing losses represent an economic threat to the hospital and to any other
hospital treating large numbers of AIDS patients.

Major factors in the high cost of caring for AIDS patients include the long
duration and high intensity of their care, their repeated bouts of
hospitalization, and the fact that most must be kept isolated in single rooms.

Other factors such as complicated and expensive medical and surgical therapies,
computerized X-ray scans, hemodialysis, surgical biopsies, numerous diagnostic
tests involving virtually every organ, respirators and other life-sustaining
support combine to escalate costs.

Bellevue's nursing administrators said AIDS patients required a minimum of seven
hours of nursing a day, but often received far less because of shortages in
nursing and the nursing support staff.

''As result,'' Miss Shayan said, ''everyone gets shortchanged. There is no time
for emotional support. It's the caring functions that are sacrificed.''

Beth Krukofsky, a psychiatric nurse who deals with AIDS cases, said, ''The
emotional strain on nurses is tremendous.''

''It's had its effect on everyone, trapping us in our inability to do
anything,'' Mr. Milch said. ''And it promises to get much worse.'' Learning to
Cope With Certain Defeat Hospitals and nurses generally expect varying degrees
of success in treating patients. Their successes allow them to accept occasional
defeats. It has always been a delicate emotional balance.

However, every AIDS patient promises a fatal outcome, no matter what is done,
and that has altered the perceptions of many doctors and nurses at Bellevue.

''Our attitudes have changed,'' said Dr. Frank J. O'Brien, the chief resident in
medicine. ''We are seeing young men our own age die and we can do nothing to
prevent their inexorable downhill course.''

''The hardest thing for a doctor to learn is to cope with death,'' he said.
''It's very demoralizing, so we learn to distance ourselves. Otherwise, death
here is so commonplace that we'd be torn apart.''

AIDS also is causing doctors to alter their inclination to employ a full array
of aggressive medical techniques that are part of the medical arsenal of any
major teaching program in a sophisticated hospital.

Instead, AIDS patients are increasingly being asked in the early stages of their
illness what they want done for them when the end is near.

Most patients, long accustomed to being treated as medical pariahs, say they
would forgo aggressive life-saving technology and painfully invasive treatments
in favor of a little human compassion.

''Last April I sat down with a patient, a 30-year-old former drug user who was
reaching the end of the road,'' Dr. O' Brien said. ''He had severe pneumocystis
carinii pneumonia and meningitis and we both knew what was coming up and we both
wanted to get down to brass tacks.

''I asked him if he wanted to go to the I.C.U., and he said no.

''Did he want to be intubated? No. Any invasive treatment? No. He said no to
just about everything else. He said all he wanted was a bed, oxygen and
medications to make him as comfortable as possible.''

Nevertheless, AIDS patients continue to die in Bellevue's intensive care unit
attached to almost every piece of elaborate life-sustaining equipment available.

Some die alone and abandoned by their friends and families.

Dr. Susan Sageman, an attending psychiatrist and a member of the hospital's AIDS
task force, said AIDS patients had been made social and medical outcasts at the
very moment when they needed compassion and support the most.

''They are in pain, they are severely emaciated and depressed, many of them can
no longer breath by themselves and most are abandoned,'' she said. ''Bellevue
has made breakthroughs in medicine and surgery. But AIDS has had a humbling
effect. Bellevue now must learn more about dying.''

Dr. Sageman, who has treated more than 100 AIDS patients in the last five years,
said that in some ways the hospital had gone through the same psychological
stages dying people experience - from the initial reaction of anger and fear,
through denial and then to acceptance.

She said that because AIDS victims were mainly drug users or homosexuals, some
were racked by guilt, more so, she said, than patients who are dying of lung
cancer induced by smoking.

''They ask me,'' she said, '' 'Is this God's way of punishing me?' ''

Because residents are so young, she said, they rarely have the emotional
fortitude or experience to handle death openly and compassionately.

Dr. Sageman said over recent months increasing numbers of AIDS patients have
asked doctors to forgo aggressive care in favor of stronger painkillers and a
''death with dignity.'' She said the trend had caused the hospital to act more
quickly in determining whether a patient is competent to refuse treatment and to
respect refusals when they are given. Staff Members' Fears Of Catching AIDS
Subside Jeanne Kalinoski, a nurse and a clinical instructor in the care of AIDS
at Bellevue, said ''touching is basic to hospital care, it can't be avoided.''
So she said her primary goal at the hospital was to ''bring down the level of
paranoia among hospital workers'' who are afraid to go near, much less touch, an
AIDS patient.

''Initially, people here were very frightened,'' she said. But after two years
of intensive education among Bellevue's 5,000 workers, she said, there was much
less evidence today of the fear that gripped Bellevue when AIDS first broke out.

''The more you know about the virus that causes AIDS, the more you realize how
difficult it is to transmit it,'' said Dr. Mitchell Charap, director of
Bellevue's medical clinics.

According to medical authorities, AIDS is transmitted sexually or through a
contaminated needle, contaminated blood or an exchange of bodily secretions.

Nowadays, nursing aides are less fearful about attending AIDS patients, and
transportation workers no longer refuse to wheel them from one place to another.
Doctors and nurses rarely put on face masks. Some decline to wear protective
surgical gloves, even when they are changing tubes and shunts that require
inserting and withdrawing needles.

Every AIDS patient in Bellevue is assigned to an attending physician and a
medical team consisting of a second- or third-year resident, two first-year
interns and two fourth-year medical students.

In most cases, AIDS patients are isolated to protect them from catching an
infection from someone else, and to make sure the staff observes strict
infection precautions. The Hospitals Of Last Resort Municipal hospitals such as
Bellevue are often the hospitals of last resort for patients without health
insurance. Thus the city's municipal hospitals, and Bellevue in particular
because of its location in Manhattan, must accept any AIDS patient, many of whom
are referred by private hospitals.

To escape the dehumanization and the high cost of unnecessary hospitalization,
hospitals such as San Fransisco General have created an outpatient network for
AIDS patients.

In contrast, New York City has comparatively few outpatient facilities and much
fewer shelters or hospices. This has forced hospitals to admit AIDS patients
when there is nothing medically they can do for them, and then required them to
keep them far longer than necessary because many AIDS victims have no other
place to go.

In the case of intravenous drug users who have contracted AIDS from sharing
contaminated needles, municipal hospitals are invariably the only place they are
ever treated. At Bellevue, AIDS patients who were drug users now outnumber
homosexual AIDS patients.

Many of the drug users are city prisoners from Rikers Island who remain under
guard until they leave or die.

In the intensive care unit, a prisoner near death in one of the unit's three
AIDS isolation rooms was being kept alive by a respirator, dialysis and
intravenous feeding. His chart showed he had lost 38 pounds in two weeks. His
hands and feet were tied down to prevent him from inadvertently pulling out or
disconnecting the numerous tubes leading into his body.

In this case, doctors said they had no choice but to provide the prisoner with
aggressive treatment because no one had asked him earlier what he wanted done.
He died Dec. 7.

Dr. Sageman said intraveous drug users often had to be treated differently from
homosexuals.

She said drug users were often ''social outcasts or street people'' with severe
emotional, mental and physical problems. She said many who have have been
diagnosed as having AIDS resume injecting themselves with drugs after they are
released from the hospital.

Female partners of drug addicts with AIDS are especially at risk, she said,
because addicts regard injecting heroin mixed with blood as a bond of love.

''I spend a lot of my time trying to convince drug users to boil their
syringes,'' she said.

Dr. Sageman also said that compared with homosexual AIDS patients, drug users
had far less support in or outside the hospital.

Another difference, she said, is the state law protecting prisoners against
medical experiments. She said the law prevents the hospital from giving drug
users who are prisoners the same experimental drugs and therapies given to other
AIDS patients. The Lethal Onslaught Facing AIDS Patients For a
doctor-in-training, AIDS patients present an encyclopedia of diseases and
illnesses that are rarely seen in modern medicine.

In most cases, the diseases that afflict AIDS patients are either rare,
self-limiting or responsive to treatment in people with normal immune systems.
In AIDS patients, they become a lethal onslaught.

The most prevalent disease is pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, which ultimately
is the cause of death of most AIDS patients. It is a form of pneumonia from
which people with normal immune systems are protected. According to Dr. Holzman,
no person with a normal immune system has ever had this form of pneumonia.

But for AIDS victims, the pneumonia is highly destructive. Although it initially
responds to anti-viral drugs, the pneumonia recurs, leaving victims
progressively less able on each occasion to withstand its ravages. About
two-thirds of all AIDS patients have this form of pneumonia, and about 30
percent of them die during their first hospitalization for the disease.

Dr. Holzman said the second most prevalent disease among homosexual patients was
a rare form of cancer called Kaposi's sarcoma. About one-third of homosexual
AIDS patients have the malignancy, while it occurs in only 6 percent of drug
users.

In many cases, AIDS patients have symptoms that mimic those of tubercular
consumptives, and they become feverish and severely emaciated.

Other diseases that occur are tuberculosis; toxoplasmosis, a major cause of
encephalitis; cryptococal meningitis, an infection of the membranes surrounding
the brain and the central nervous system; myocarditis, an infection of the heart
lining; dementia; candida esophagitis, a fungus infection of the esophagus;
cytomegalovirus, a viral disease; infectious mononucleosis, and a host of other
microbacterial and viral infections.

According to Dr. Holzman, the immune systems of drug users with AIDS are usually
more suppressed than those of homosexuals. This means that drug users tend to
die more swiftly.

''Everything in the body is failing at once,'' Dr. Holzman said.

Generally, AIDS patients are hospitalized several times. Two years ago, the
average length of a first hospitalization at Bellevue was 48 days. But better
use of drugs and treatments, earlier diagnosis, and improved placements into
outpatient settings have reduced it to 25 days.

Generally, each hospitalization becomes more intensive as the patients become
more vulnerable to repeated infectious assaults.

''It's a slow, torturous way to die,'' Dr. O'Brien said.  Susan Movisso, head
nurse in the intensive care unit, said many AIDS patients there were awake to
the end, unlike other terminal patients who fall into comas and are thus spared
the final agony of dying.

''It's horrible for them and emotionally devastating for everyone else,'' she
said. AIDS and the Training Of New Doctors The expanding AIDS caseload at
Bellevue is a matter of increasing concern among the interns and residents at
Bellevue and within the Department of Medicine, which is run by New York
University.

N.Y.U. operates one of country's largest and most sought-after hospital
residency programs in medicine, rotating 78 interns and residents through three
hospitals on First Avenue -Bellevue, at 27th Street, University Hospital, a
private, N.Y.U.-affiliated institution at 31st Street, and the Veterans
Administration Hospital at 24th Street.

Faculty members expressed concern that treating a disproportionately large
number of AIDS patients could stigmatize Bellevue and upset an overall patient
mix that traditionally has offered N.Y.U.-Bellevue residents a classic
postgraduate training in medicine in a major big city hospital.

However, Dr. Saul Farber, the department's chairman, said, ''AIDS is so very
complicated that it teaches you a great deal - from immune infections to cancer.
AIDS is the study of medicine and everyone who treats it deserves the Silver
Star medal.''

Training in internal medicine at N.Y.U-Bellevue is highly selective, attracting
nearly 1,500 applicants for its 78 residencies each year. Thus far, Dr. Farber
said, ''not one applicant'' has expressed any reservations about caring for AIDS
patients.

But Dr. Farber said state and city health authorities must make every effort to
insure that the burden of caring for AIDS is more evenly distributed among New
York's private and public hospitals. Municipal hospitals, with only 20 percent
of the city's hospital beds, care for half of the AIDS patients.

Because one of its primary missions is the training of doctors, Bellevue's
interns and residents have a strong incentive to employ a vast array of
diagnostic tests and high technology, just to gain experience.

According to some physicians at Bellevue, the reality that all the tests and all
the technology have failed to prevent a single death is now beginning to raise
questions about whether most AIDS patients should be treated in teaching
hospitals.

State and Federal health officials contend that many AIDS patients would be
better off at home or in nursing homes, shelters and hospices that emphasize
palliative care and emotional support.

''They know and we know they are not going to make it here. But we still try to
give them hope.''

LEXISNEXIS SUMMARY:
 ...  Corporate America is concerned about AIDS - and it should be. ...  A
common initiative implemented by corporate employers, and one that is championed
by AIDS advocates, is employee HIV/AIDS education. ...  In fact, the Centers for
Disease Control (CDC) survey of United States businesses found that corporate
philanthropy is the single most common way in which businesses are involved with
HIV/AIDS. ...  These pharmaceutical companies are alternately heroes and
villains in the AIDS battle; many of them can and do invest enormous sums of
money in AIDS drug research, but they generally market these new drugs at very
high prices. ...  In summary, corporate America has done almost nothing to
measure the effectiveness of its own workplace HIV/AIDS programs, whether it
evaluates that effectiveness by dollars saved or by other measures. ...  To
assess the effectiveness of its program, Polaroid surveyed its employees and
found that they are more knowledgeable about AIDS than the general public and
have more positive attitudes toward people affected by the disease. ...
Research regarding the corporate response to the AIDS crisis indicates that many
large American companies have implemented workplace policies, trained managers,
educated employees, provided health insurance coverage, and donated money in the
battle against HIV/AIDS. ...

   I. Introduction

 Corporate America is concerned about AIDS - and it should be.  n1 Each year
since 1993, AIDS has been the leading cause of death for Americans between the
ages of twenty-five and forty-four, and more than fifty percent of America's 126
million workers are in this age group.  n2 Stated in more dramatic terms, these
statistics mean that AIDS is the leading killer of one half of the American
workforce.  n3 Without the threat of death posed by HIV infection,  n4 these
same Americans would have thirty to fifty years to participate in the American
workforce or as consumers of corporate products.  n5

     [*1092]  AIDS is a reality in the workplace. One in six American worksites
with more than fifty employees has had at least one employee with HIV infection
or AIDS.  n6 Many employees also have children, spouses, or domestic partners
infected with the disease.  n7 Even those employees without direct experience
with AIDS have been affected by the disease.  n8

    These statistics translate into potentially enormous costs for American
corporations and, more broadly, for the American economy.  n9 In the purest
dollar-based measures, societal costs resulting from HIV/AIDS include direct
costs, such as medical and nonmedical costs associated with HIV screening,
diagnosis, and counseling, and medical treatment for persons with HIV/AIDS.  n10
Other potential costs that are more difficult to measure, but are predicted to
increase as HIV/AIDS prevalence rates rise, include "reduction in investment and
savings due to higher healthcare expenditures," a "decline in labor productivity
[and output] due to worker absenteeism and loss of experienced workers," and
adverse "changes in labor market supply and demand."  n11

    American corporations bear a portion of these societal costs while acting in
multiple roles: as merchant, employer, philanthropist,  [*1093]  and corporate
citizen.  n12 To date, as the result of the AIDS epidemic, the most threatening
expenses faced by American corporations and the most significant responses from
American corporations have been in their role as employers.  n13 Large American
corporations (i.e. firms with more than 100 workers) employ sixty-five percent
of the American workforce.  n14 America's health insurance system is largely
employer-based, so our corporations pay some of the health insurance costs
caused by the AIDS crisis.  n15 In addition, corporate employers frequently
provide health-related benefits, such as short- and long-term disability and
life insurance.  n16

    Corporate employers also face numerous other potential costs occasioned by
the disease.  n17 The costs associated with the hiring and training of
replacement workers fall to American employers.  n18 Employee productivity and
morale can be negatively affected by experiences with the disease.  n19
Employers also face rising litigation costs resulting from real and alleged
violations of laws prohibiting discriminatory treatment of employees with HIV/
AIDS.  n20 "AIDS has generated more individual lawsuits across a broad range of
health issues than any other disease in [American] history."  n21 Furthermore,
AIDS threatens to reduce the size of the skilled labor pool in some communities,
especially in developing countries.  n22

     [*1094]  AIDS has created a new set of management issues for employers, and
has deepened and complicated already existing issues.  n23 Employee health and
safety concerns, a major issue in some industries, carry new implications
because of HIV/AIDS.  n24 The most obvious example of this can be found in the
health care industry, in which the possibility of blood-borne contamination is
probably the greatest.  n25 As a result of the AIDS crisis, health care
facilities are now required by federal law to implement a blood-borne pathogen
standard that covers five million employees nationally.  n26 In addition to
managing the real safety concerns created by HIV/AIDS, employers must address
the hostility and fear experienced by some employees toward their co-workers
with HIV/AIDS.  n27

    Employers are now required to comply with federal and state laws - in many
instances, new and untested statutes - governing the rights of persons with HIV/
AIDS.  n28 As part of this effort, employers are attempting to accommodate the
special needs of infected employees.  n29 In addition, employers face the dual
task of appropriately and legally addressing concerns regarding confidentiality
of an employee's HIV/AIDS status, while simultaneously ensuring the safety and
health of other employees.  n30 Establishing and implementing methods and
policies with which to address these new  [*1095]  management issues requires
expenditure of corporate time and money.  n31

    Finally, some corporations have been called upon to contribute financially
to community efforts to battle HIV/AIDS, in addition to whatever initiatives
they may have undertaken as employers.  n32 Corporations working in the health
care or pharmaceutical industries have come under considerable pressure to
accept a loss in profits in order to make drugs or health care available to
persons with AIDS who are otherwise unable to afford such treatment.  n33 In
addition to these more immediate costs, economists, AIDS advocates, and others
warn that American corporations will experience financial losses because of the
shrinking markets, both domestically and overseas, that will result from the
AIDS crisis.  n34

    American corporations have been barraged by costs - direct, indirect, and
speculative - as a result of the AIDS epidemic.  n35 Some corporations have
taken action to address one or more of these costs.  n36 The interesting public
policy considerations raised by the pattern of corporate response include not
only the particular costs to which corporate America has responded, but also the
motivation behind the response.  n37


   II. The Corporate Response to the AIDS Crisis

 Corporations have responded in a variety of ways to the AIDS crisis; for the
most part, those responses have been in the corpora-  [*1096]  tions' role as
employers.  n38 The most common response by corporate employers consists of
general benefits provided for all employees, including those suffering from HIV/
AIDS.  n39 In the United States, almost all corporations offer their employees
group health insurance, and most of these policies cover HIV/AIDS.  n40 Thus,
those businesses that cite health insurance benefits as their company's response
to HIV/AIDS are usually referring to benefit programs that are already in place
and available to employees in general.  n41 There may, however, be additional
costs to the employer because those benefits are extended to employees suffering
from HIV/AIDS.  n42 Because of such costs, or the fear of additional costs,
approximately five percent of American businesses that provide group health
insurance limit or exclude HIV/AIDS from coverage under the health insurance
policy they offer to employees.  n43

    Similarly, most large American businesses have developed a general personnel
policy that addresses HIV/AIDS, but relatively few  [*1097]  have implemented
formal HIV/AIDS policy statements.  n44 This tendency to incorporate HIV/AIDS
policies and benefits into a general policy may reflect a desire to treat HIV/
AIDS as another serious illness, rather than as a separate personnel issue.  n45
It may also be more cost efficient for employers to implement a single policy or
set of benefits that incorporates HIV/AIDS, rather than to implement a special
policy to address HIV/AIDS issues.  n46

    A common initiative implemented by corporate employers, and one that is
championed by AIDS advocates, is employee HIV/AIDS education.  n47 In the United
States, one in six large worksites offers AIDS education to its employees; most
of these education programs address primarily occupational issues.  n48 It is
noteworthy that a survey of European, as well as American, corporate employers
indicates a much higher percentage of companies have implemented education and
training programs specific to HIV/AIDS.  n49 Worksites in which employees have
potential exposure to blood are much more likely to offer HIV/AIDS education
than worksites with little or no exposure.  n50

    Although the variety of workplace programs, taken together, constitute one
of corporate America's most typical responses to the AIDS crisis, corporations
also have addressed the crisis as philan-  [*1098]  thropists.  n51 In fact, the
Centers for Disease Control (CDC) survey of United States businesses found that
corporate philanthropy is the single most common way in which businesses are
involved with HIV/AIDS.  n52 The CDC survey broadly defined philanthropy to
include "[f]undraising, [g]rants, [v]olunteerism, [i]n-[k]ind [s]ervices,
[s]taff or [f]acilities."  n53 [bns ] According to the CDC, nearly half of all
businesses with 100-249 employees participated in such activities, as did 86% of
worksites with more than 750 employees.  n54 When philanthropy has been defined
more narrowly as "corporate contributions," the level of participation has been
found to be much lower.  n55

    A narrow segment of corporate America, the pharmaceutical industry, has
responded directly to the AIDS crisis by investing in research and development
of new drugs to fight AIDS.  n56 These pharmaceutical companies are alternately
heroes and villains in the AIDS battle; many of them can and do invest enormous
sums of money in AIDS drug research, but they generally market these new drugs
at very high prices.  n57 Drug companies claim that these high prices are
necessary to cover the exorbitant cost of testing and marketing the drugs, and
to account for the potentially short time frame in which a particular drug
remains on the market.  n58

     [*1099]  Some pharmaceutical companies have given away certain drugs,
especially expensive experimental drugs, to a limited number of AIDS patients.
n59 Glaxo Wellcome offered "to provide thousands of HIV-positive women [in South
Africa] with access to cheap AZT [to reduce] the risk of their passing the virus
to their children."  n60 Glaxo proposed to supply the drug to the government of
South Africa at its usual price to avoid it being re-exported, but the company
committed to re-invest the difference in cost between the actual and discounted
price in AIDS programs within South Africa.  n61

    In sum, much of corporate America has responded to HIV/AIDS and in a variety
of ways.  n62 In fact, the CDC has found that nearly all of America's corporate
employers have some sort of AIDS-related programs in place.  n63 Similarly, a
report issued by the Conference Board regarding the corporate response to HIV/
AIDS found that  [*1100]  seventy-three percent of the companies responding to
its survey were currently addressing the issue of HIV/AIDS in one manner or
another.  n64


   III. The Cost Effectiveness of Corporate Action

 Most corporations have not attempted, or have attempted without success, to
measure the impact of their HIV/AIDS-related initiatives.  n65 In fact, it
appears that most companies have not even identified the criteria necessary to
judge the effectiveness of their programs.  n66

    In general, cost effectiveness of an HIV/AIDS prevention program may be
measured by evaluating the cost of the program per HIV infection prevented.  n67
The variables considered in analyzing cost effectiveness of HIV/AIDS prevention
programs include: "program cost, number of people reached, their risk behaviors
and HIV incidence, and the effectiveness of the intervention in changing
behavior."  n68 These variables, however, do not neatly apply to corporate
America's HIV/AIDS programs because so many of these are workplace programs.
n69 AIDS initiatives undertaken by corporate employers may not strive solely, or
even primarily, to prevent new HIV/AIDS infection.  n70 Instead, these workplace
programs are designed to address issues raised by current HIV infection among
employees.  n71 Currently, there is no established or accepted model that
[*1101]  assesses the cost effectiveness of such a workplace AIDS program.  n72
Furthermore, even if there were a useful model of assessing cost effectiveness,
such an economic analysis may fail to address other measures of effectiveness
aside from cost savings, such as reduced human suffering.

    Despite the lack of data, most companies voice confidence in the cost
effectiveness of their efforts.  n73 One business leader has explained that
""[a]s a result of our HIV/AIDS in the workplace efforts, our workforce is much
more at ease with dealing with these issues... That in turn has reduced our lost
time, and increased our productivity. And in that sense, it's a real bottom-line
plus.'"  n74 Another executive has asserted, ""I know our initiatives are
effective by looking at incident rates in our company. Furthermore, as a
self-insured organization, this represents significant savings in healthcare.'"
n75

    Even corporate philanthropic activities can be evaluated for
cost-effectiveness.  n76 Although companies that engage in philanthropic efforts
to battle AIDS may be trying to be good corporate citizens, the business
justification for such actions is that these philanthropic activities benefit
the public image of a company, and that this benefit is expected to translate
into increased sales.  n77 For example, in 1996, Tanqueray provided
approximately $ 4 million in cash and marketing to support five American AIDS
Rides.  n78 As part of this effort, Tanqueray integrated the AIDS Rides into its
own marketing and promotional programs.  n79

    Some business leaders have taken the position that dollar impact is not the
principal objective of their corporations' initiatives in this area.  n80 These
corporations discuss the impact of their programs in terms of increased
"employee safety, well-being and awareness and  [*1102]  prevention [of the
disease]."  n81 Again, most companies have not articulated clear criteria for
evaluating the effectiveness of their HIV/AIDS programs in this area, but they
believe their programs are having a generally positive impact on employees.  n82
When asked what kind of effect their program was having on employees' attitudes,
sixty-seven percent believed the impact was positive, thirty-two percent
believed there was no impact, and only two percent believed the program had a
negative impact.  n83 When asked the same question regarding employee
commitment, fifty-two percent of respondents said that the program had a
positive impact, forty-seven percent said it had no impact, and only one percent
said the program had a negative impact.  n84

    Despite employer confidence in the efficacy of workplace HIV/AIDS programs,
worker attitudes about AIDS have not changed significantly over time.  n85 Data
regarding employee attitudes about AIDS in 1992 and 1997 indicates that,
although changes in employee attitudes have been generally positive, the changes
have been so limited that they can hardly be considered meaningful.  n86 The
percentage of employees who said that an HIV-positive employee "would be treated
like any other employee with a serious disability or illness" increased only
four points, from seventy-eight percent in 1992 to eighty-two percent in 1997.
n87 In 1997, as well as in 1992, nine out of ten employees said that an
HIV-positive employee should be treated like any other employee.  n88 In 1992,
sixty-seven percent of employees said that coworkers "would definitely or
probably feel uncomfortable" working with someone with HIV or AIDS; that number
had decreased to sixty-three percent by 1997.  n89 Less than three out of ten
employees responded that coworkers should feel uncomfortable working in close
proximity to an infected coworker.  n90

     [*1103]  Employees' perceptions of how their employers would respond to
employees with HIV/AIDS followed the same trend.  n91 The number of employees
who believed an HIV-positive employee would be fired or put on disability at the
first sign of illness decreased only slightly, from thirty-two percent in 1992
to twenty-nine percent in 1997.  n92 Likewise, those who said an HIV-positive
employee should be fired or put on disability decreased three percentage points
over the five year period, from twenty-four percent to twenty-one percent.  n93
Fifteen percent of employees polled in 1992 believed that their company would
restrict health insurance coverage of an HIV-positive employee; this number had
decreased very slightly to thirteen percent in 1997.  n94 Very few employees
felt that businesses should restrict coverage - seven percent in 1992 and only
four percent in 1997.  n95

    In summary, corporate America has done almost nothing to measure the
effectiveness of its own workplace HIV/AIDS programs, whether it evaluates that
effectiveness by dollars saved or by other measures.  n96 Business leaders who
are asked about the effectiveness of their workplace programs believe they are
effective, even if they cannot quantify the effectiveness of a program in
dollars.  n97 Data on employee attitudes nationally indicates, however, that
although employee attitudes have improved, those improvements have been only
marginal over a five year period.  n98

    On a more optimistic note, the few corporations that have attempted to set
criteria for, and measure the effectiveness of, their HIV/AIDS initiatives have
not found this task impossible.  n99 Polaroid reports that its AIDS awareness
program, started more than ten years ago, has provided a good return on
investment in terms of its effect on the "bottom line," as well as its impact on
employees.  n100  [*1104]  To assess the effectiveness of its program, Polaroid
surveyed its employees and found that they are more knowledgeable about AIDS
than the general public and have more positive attitudes toward people affected
by the disease.  n101 Furthermore, "Polaroid has not experienced any AIDS
-related employee grievances, litigation or workplace disruption."  n102

    IV. What Motivates the Corporate Response?

    In any context, motivation is difficult to identify, measure, or prove. We
cannot know with any certainty what motivates corporate America as a whole, or
even what motivates an individual corporation.  n103 Of course, the underlying
assumption in a capitalist economic system such as ours is that profit-making is
the overriding impetus for action in the business sector; even so, many
corporate leaders profess to act as good corporate citizens by implementing some
policies simply because it is the right thing to do.  n104

    Corporations cite a variety of factors as motivation for implementing HIV/
AIDS workplace programs. A recent study of companies in the U.S. and Europe
found that the welfare of employees with AIDS was the most frequently cited
reason for such initiatives.  n105 Another commonly mentioned motivation was
general safety and disease prevention.  n106

    Aside from these more altruistic motivations, the factors that have most
frequently prompted corporations to implement work-  [*1105]  place HIV/AIDS
programs are related to corporate costs.  n107 Twenty-four percent of the
responding companies said that legal implications, including potential
litigation and regulatory requirements, caused them to address HIV/AIDS.  n108
Another sixteen percent of the companies said that they were motivated by health
care costs.  n109 Absenteeism due to illness was an additional cost-related
factor cited by eight percent of the employers polled.  n110

    The threat of litigation, and the costs attendant to it, as a result of
discriminatory treatment or breaches of the confidentiality rights of an
individual with AIDS, has become very real in the United States.  n111 The steps
an employer must take to ensure compliance with federal and state laws can,
themselves, be costly.  n112

    The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal statute that
potentially offers great protection to an employee with HIV/AIDS. Although
employers must be careful to comply with the ADA, however, it is not always
clear that a particular employee with HIV/AIDS is protected under this statute.
Title I of that Act protects qualified individuals with a disability from
discrimination.  n113 The ADA definition of a disability generally covers AIDS;
n114  [*1106]  frequently, it also covers HIV infection, but HIV-infected
individuals are not automatically classified as disabled.  n115

    The ADA requires an employer to provide reasonable accommodations to an
employee who could perform the essential functions of a job with such
accommodations.  n116 Possible reasonable accommodations might include job
restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, or reassignment to a vacant
position.  n117 Employers are not required to provide accommodations if such
accommodations would constitute "an undue hardship" to the employer,  n118 but
this determination is made on a case-by-case basis and is affected by the size
and financial resources of the employer.  n119 Thus, larger corporations may be
expected to offer greater and more costly accommodations to employees.  n120

    The ADA also acts to prevent an employer from refusing to hire an applicant
who is HIV-positive.  n121 Although anemployer may make preemployment inquiries
about the applicant's ability to perform job duties, medical examinations may be
required by the employer only after an offer of employment has been extended and
prior to the commencement of actual employment.  n122 Thus, an employer is
prevented from gathering medical information that would  [*1107]  enable the
employer to make hiring decisions based on an applicant's HIV/AIDS status.  n123

    Other federal statutes that require attention from employers making
decisions regarding employees with HIV/AIDS include: the Rehabilitation Act of
1973,  n124 the Employee Retirement Income Security Act,  n125 the Occupational
Safety and Health Act,  n126 the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act
(COBRA),  n127 and the National Labor Relations Act.  n128 Consideration must be
given to the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth
Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.  n129

    In addition to the federal requirements, many states have enacted their own
laws to prohibit such discrimination, and/or to protect the right of an
individual to keep his or her HIV/AIDS status confidential.  n130 In New York,
for example, a violation of the right of an employee to confidentiality can
result in imposition of substantial financial penalties, both civil and
criminal.  n131

    Employers faced with cost and management issues created by federal and state
legal requirements have been told that one of the most effective methods of
controlling such costs is to develop an HIV/AIDS policy, and to implement it
fairly and consistently.  n132 Nearly all companies that have developed such a
policy also have  [*1108]  trained managers in its application.  n133 The mere
existence of an employer policy condemning discrimination on the basis of HIV/
AIDS status can be helpful to an employer defending against a claim of
discrimination.  n134

    Another cost consideration that has prompted corporate employers to take
action against AIDS has been the threat of rising health insurance costs.  n135
As noted earlier, a small percentage of American employers have sought to limit
insurance coverage for HIV/AIDS.  n136 A more common response to this cost issue
has been to implement AIDS education programs, in an effort to reduce incident
rates among employees.  n137

    In addition, profit considerations obviously have worked to determine
whether, and to what degree, pharmaceutical companies have invested in the
research and marketing of AIDS drugs.  n138 Until recently, drug companies
invested little in drug trials on medications to treat children with AIDS; the
companies had insufficient economic incentive to develop pediatric data because
children constituted such a small percentage of those diagnosed with AIDS.  n139
Similarly, some experts maintain that relatively little money has  [*1109]  been
invested by drug companies in developing a vaccine because it is not as
lucrative as drug treatment.  n140

    Thus, a variety of cost considerations have caused corporate America to take
action to limit the potential effects of HIV/AIDS on their employees, and in
turn, their businesses.  n141 Early predictions portrayed corporate America as
suffering from very high costs due to AIDS.  n142 Fear engendered by these
predictions served as a useful motivator.  n143 More recent studies, however,
have indicated that costs, at least direct costs such as health care and
insurance costs, have been considerably lower than initially anticipated.  n144
For business firms with more than 100 workers, the maximum expected five-year
cost for an HIV-infected employee has been estimated at $ 32,000, with an
average expected cost of $ 17,000.  n145 These costs include both medical and
other business costs.  n146 The average total costs of a year of medical care
for an AIDS patient, which are much higher than the costs to the employer, are
about $ 250,000.  n147 These costs are comparable to the cost of cancer
treatment or other terminal conditions, and such costs generally have not
troubled employers.  n148 In addition, "the number of AIDS-related group
accident and health insurance payments has actually declined since 1992."  n149
Given these recent lower estimates of the costs associated with HIV/AIDS, there
may be some danger that all of America, including  [*1110]  its corporations,
will become less panic-stricken by the AIDS threat, leaving corporations less
motivated to invest resources in HIV/AIDS initiatives.


   V. The Ideal Corporate Role

 Corporate America is frequently accused of failing to "do its share" to address
larger social problems or, when it has taken action, of being motivated solely
by profit.  n150 These criticisms of American corporations are part of an
ongoing debate about the appropriate role for American corporations in
policymaking, the political process, and philanthropy in America.  n151 This
debate involves fascinating ethical and political questions that are central to
how societal change occurs, and should occur, in America.  n152 But those
questions are not susceptible to objective response by anyone.  n153

    The objective fact at issue here is that corporate America is taking action
against HIV/AIDS.  n154 Research regarding the corporate response to the AIDS
crisis indicates that many large American companies have implemented workplace
policies, trained managers, educated employees, provided health insurance
coverage, and donated money in the battle against HIV/AIDS.  n155 The
effectiveness of these activities in preventing AIDS or changing public
attitudes is largely undetermined, and may warrant attention by both poli-
[*1111]  cymakers and the corporations themselves. Whether these efforts
constitute a "fair" contribution by corporate America is, as we have said, a
question of ethics on which reasonable people will differ.  n156 Accusing
corporate leaders of failing to contribute adequately is ineffectual in the
effort against AIDS - unless we believe that such accusations serve as a further
impetus to action.

    It is simply beside the point to suggest that corporations - even those that
are most active in the AIDS arena - are motivated only by profit considerations.
n157 American corporations are required to make decisions based on profit.  n158
Corporate leaders have fiduciary responsibilities to corporate shareholders to
ensure that the business imperatives of the corporation are met. Critics may
take issue with this economic scheme, but nothing short of a revolution in the
American economic system will change the fundamental assumption that the purpose
of a business corporation is to make money.  n159 Thus, the key to ensuring that
corporate America takes appropriate action to fight HIV/AIDS is to highlight the
economic necessity of such action.  n160 If profit is a critical motivator of
American businesses, then a goal of policymakers should be to demonstrate to
those businesses how HIV/AIDS will affect their profit margins.  n161


   VI. Conclusion

 Corporate America has not sought glory in the fight against HIV/AIDS and has
seldom found it.  n162 That is not to say, however, that corporations have
failed to take action.  n163 Corporate America  [*1112]  has focused on
workplace policies, motivated by financial and legal considerations, as well as
good corporate citizenship.  n164 We should not undervalue the corporate
contribution to the AIDS challenge: Corporate America employs so many Americans
that the potential reach of these workplace policies is very great.  n165
Critically, internal workplace programs maybe more likely than external projects
to become a permanent part of the corporate culture and structure. Thus, what
these workplace programs may lack in glory, they achieve in longevity and
breadth of impact.

    Few would debate that corporate America has played a role in the fight
against HIV/AIDS, or that American businesses could do more than they have done
to date.  n166 Implementation of corporate HIV/AIDS programs is an achievable
goal for American businesses and a critical element of a successful fight
against AIDS. As one corporate leader has said: ""When it comes to AIDS, a good
business person may save more lives than a good doctor.'"  n167

Additionally, the study surveyed 2000 senior executives and mid-level managers
at 203 U.S.- and European-based companies. See Elif Kaban, U.N. Survey:

assist employees affected with HIV/AIDS).




n40.  A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Survey, issued July 19, 1996,
found that 96% of worksites with 50-99 employees, 98% of worksites with 100-749
employees, and 100% of worksites with 750 or more employees offer group health
insurance. See Jorgensen et al., supra note 6, at
<http://www.hivpositive/f-HIVyou/CDCworkSurvey/chart12.html> (showing almost all
worksites surveyed offered group health insurance). A survey of both U.S. and
European corporations published in September 1997 found that 61% of corporate
employers provide medical leave benefits that cover employees with HIV/AIDS. See
Corporate Response, supra note 1, at 4 fig.2, 5 fig.3 (charting the initiatives
taken by employers to address HIV/AIDS issues and noting that medical leave

Statistics indicating that 92% of the employees in medium- and large-sized firms
are covered by health insurance).




n42.  See generally id. (estimating employment-based incremental costs to a firm
employing a person with HIV/AIDS).




n43.  Seven percent of businesses with 50-99 employees, 4% of businesses with
100-249 employees, 2.7% of businesses with 250-749 employees, and .4% of
businesses with more than 750 employees exclude or limit coverage for AIDS from
the group health insurance offered. See Jorgensen et al., supra note 6, at
<http://www.hivpositive/f-HIVyou/CDCworkSurvey /chart05.html> (charting how
employers who responded to the survey either limit or restrict health coverage
for HIV/AIDS).




n44.  The majority of all American worksites have a policy addressing life
threatening illness or disabilities, and the majority of worksites with more
than 100 employees include HIV/AIDS under this general policy. See id. at
<http://www.hivpositive/f-HIVyou/CDCwork-Survey/chart07.html>. Compare id.
(noting that very few worksites, however, have a policy specifically addressing
HIV/AIDS issues) with Corporate Response, supra note 1, at 5 fig.3. A survey of
both American and European corporations produced somewhat different figures.
Approximately 39% of U.S.- and European-based multinational companies responding
to a survey by the Conference Board said that they have a "general policy
statement that includes HIV/AIDS," while just over 30% reported having formal
policy statements specifically addressing HIV/AIDS. See id.

n62.  The response from multinational corporations appears to be significantly
better in western countries than in developing nations. See Myo Thant & Ann
Marie Kimball, A Role for Businesses in HIV Prevention in Asia, 347 Lancet 1670,
1671 (1996) (arguing that programs initiated by western corporations have not
been extended to Asian countries). This is cause for special concern because the
great majority of HIV infections are in developing countries. See Merson, supra
note 34, at 14-17 (noting the increase in HIV infection in areas such as Latin
America, Africa, India, and the Pacific Rim). The same multinational
corporations that may have active programs in their home offices in North
America or Europe, frequently have not extended similar efforts to their
overseas subsidiaries. Corporations praised for taking a leadership role in the
response to the AIDS crisis in developing nations are frequently American-based
multinationals, such as Boeing, Digital Equipment Corporation, and Levi Strauss.
See Thant & Kimball, supra, at 1670 (discussing how these corporations have
informed company employees of the corporation's concern regarding AIDS issues).




n63.  Using a national probability survey of 2252 U.S. worksites with a 78%
response rate among eligible worksites, the CDC found that nearly all worksites
offered group health insurance; only 5% limited or excluded HIV from at least
one of the policies offered to employees. See Jorgensen et al., supra note 6, at
<http://www.hivpositive/f-HIVyou /CDCworkSur-vey/survey.htm>,
<http://www.hivpositive/f-HIVyou/CDCworkSurvey/chart02. html> (descr-ibing how
many employers offer group health insurance by employer size). More

[five] HIV/AIDS workplace program elements recommended by CDC." Id. at
<http://www.hivpositive/f-HIVyou/-CDCworkSurvey/survey.htm> (describing the
number of employers using the CDC's strategy). The five elements include: (1)
"Development of an HIV/AIDS policy;" (2) "Training of supervisors in the
policy;" (3) "HIV/AIDS education for employees;" (4) "HIV/AIDS education for
employees' families;" and (5) "Encouragement of employee volunteerism, community
service and corporate philanthropy." Id. at

n65.  One of the major findings of the Conference Board's research report
regarding Corporate Response to HIV/AIDS is that few companies even try to
measure the results of their initiatives. See Corporate Response, supra note 1,
at 7 (explaining that few companies determine a return on their investment in
such initiatives). Other researchers have noted that "extremely limited
attention" has been paid to the costs and cost-effectiveness of AIDS prevention.

 [*284]

Fiona Terry's Condemned to Repeat? The Paradox of Humanitarian Action is a
searching but profoundly flawed critique of the global aid industry, which
accuses international aid organizations of contradicting their fundamental
purpose by prolonging the suffering they seek to relieve. Through in-depth
examinations of intervention by aid organizations, Terry underscores the
political consequences of giving aid. In a controversial claim, she suggests
that aid agencies often blind themselves to the moral quandaries of their work,
behaving as though the decision to supply aid could exist independent of ethical
discussion. Terry concludes that aid agencies cannot hide behind the
humanitarian imperative and say blindly that the duty to alleviate human
suffering in the immediate sense comes before all other considerations. She
emphasizes the need to quantify potential benefits and potential harm, set
limits of acceptable compromise, and take a rights-based approach to
humanitarian action, privileging solidarity with victims.

   To demonstrate the difficult trade-offs aid agencies face, Condemned to
Repeat? sketches general arguments on humanitarian action before exploring
concrete examples of how aid contributed to conflicts in Pakistan, Honduras,
Thailand, and the Congo. Terry demonstrates in each case how humanitarian aid
benefited refugee-warriors and how much aid organizations knew about this,
analyzing how they chose to participate or refuse by weighing duty to a
population in need against moral principles. She posits that non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) often distribute humanitarian aid based on political
favoritism, and at the expense of core concepts of impartiality, need, and
neutrality.

    [*285]  This book debunks widespread assumptions about the unprecedented
challenges and "complex emergencies" taxing the post-Cold War international aid
regime, arguing that conflicts are not more barbarous than before, and that
complex emergencies and refugee-warriors are not another symptom of the new
world "disorder" but long-standing features of wars (though the international
response itself has become more complex). Skillfully exploring numerous
precedents to recent crises, Terry asks why humanitarian agencies do not learn
from experience - why the paradoxes of humanitarian aid recur. In this vein,
Terry explores some practical guidelines for practitioners seeking to address
the paradox of aid. She emphasizes that humanitarian groups face political
rather than technical challenges, and that codes of conduct and technical
guidelines give an illusion of enhanced responsibility without ensuring that aid
is truly humanitarian.

   Moreover, Terry raises another option that humanitarian agencies can - indeed
must - consider, namely the choice to withdraw from unacceptable situations.
Terry's position here is a highly personal one, drawing on her own controversial
experience withdrawing Medecins Sans Frontieres France from Rwandan camps in
Zaire. The option of withdrawing or suspending activities is typically
analogized to a nuclear weapon, which exists but should never be used. However,
Terry thoughtfully probes at the differences between a neutral stance and
passivity and argues that at times, withdrawing upholds ideals of neutrality,
honesty, and morality.

   Adept at ostrich-like self-deception, humanitarian agencies typically deny
that their interventions can prolong or fuel wars. Most explain their failings
by blaming the insufficiency of aid rather than its misdirection. As a book from
an insider in the aid industry, Terry's work plays a vital role in efforts to
self-critique and hold agencies accountable.

   However, Terry's examination of dysfunctional aspects of aid falls short of a
serious, practical study of potential solutions. Terry hardly mentions the roots
of the "humanitarian paradox" stemming from the very nature of humanitarianism.
While the book raises profound questions and contributes to meaningful
soul-searching in the aid industry, it fails in critical ways to speak to the
professional humanitarian workers who should be its primary audience. For
experienced practitioners, the central premise of this work has been obvious for
decades. Saying that humanitarian action is political is like saying blue is a
color: true, but not very illuminating. Indeed, humanitarian agencies have
become a fixture in political, diplomatic, and media circles through fieldwork,
lobbying, and fundraising.

   Any intervention contributes to the way conflicts play themselves out. The
very presence of humanitarian agencies is political, reinforcing as it does
clienteles of power, recognizing protagonists avid for international
recognition, legitimizing intermediaries, and allowing for population control by
fixing people in proximity to distribution centers. Concentration of aid
attracts not only victims, but also with them belligerents and hosts of bandits.
Moreover, this concentration encourages construction of camps with perverse
effects on the social fabric of traditional societies. Aid changes the balance
of power among competing actors and the rules of the game by which they  [*286]
compete. Mary Anderson's famous do-no-harm-approach is a na<um i>ve,
impracticable critique of aid agencies.

   Terry fails to offer any quantitative evaluations of the impact of assistance
on war economies. Without concrete information on this issue, practitioners
cannot minimize negative effects of aid. Emergency aid automatically feeds war,
but how many lives does it save, and at what price? Do downsides outweigh
benefits? What are practical solutions to minimize aid diversion and ensure that
humanitarian action prolongs suffering as little as possible? What tactics have
been successfully used in the field to widen the "humanitarian space?"

   More preoccupying than the absence of concrete solutions to the problems of
misdirection and politicization of aid is the lack of explicit reflection on
flaws inherent to aid agencies, without which Terry's analysis on humanitarian
agencies rings hollow. Three basic observations can be made. First,
humanitarianism is fundamentally reactive, providing short-term emergency relief
to save human lives, often in a context of extreme instability. The hyperactive
pace stemming from humanitarianism's very nature evidently limits the capacity
to learn from experience. Second, high staff turnover is a characteristic of the
vast majority of aid organizations. Staff who view an agency's approach
critically often leave, rather than try to achieve change from within. High
turnover and a loss of dissatisfied, critical personnel negatively impact an
organization's learning capacity. Third, humanitarian organizations often fail
to store knowledge on a structural level. Prevailing logic dictates that all
available money should be spent on direct alleviation of human suffering rather
than educating staff, developing expensive research units, and gathering,
evaluating, and diffusing information. The capacity to learn has no marketing
appeal with donors - indeed, it is often perceived as evidence of a bloated
bureaucracy.

   Agencies cannot financially resist donors' strategic, political injunctions
or maintain their independence and ability to disengage from unacceptable
situations. Most NGOs' economic imperatives prevail over the interests of
supposed beneficiaries of aid, as the multiplication of humanitarian agencies
leads to frantic competition in a limited market of donors and project
redundancy.

   Most disturbing of all, Terry focuses on the responsibility of humanitarian
agencies rather than that of governments and armed groups, despite the
overwhelming burden of the latter. Terry argues that while aid only causes a
small degree of harm to developing countries, even this is unacceptable; aid's
raison d'etre is to alleviate suffering. However, she produces no hard evidence
that aid substantially prolongs conflict in the long run. Why then, has she
chosen to focus on this aspect of the issue?

   Contributing to the rising tide of criticism of humanitarian action, Terry
holds aid agencies responsible for problems largely attributable to government
and corporate activities. She critiques aid agencies for fueling conflict, but
fails to sufficiently emphasize that cash inflows such as ransoms, asset
stripping, and predatory appropriation of local resources like opium, cocaine,
or diamonds dwarf the value of aid to combatants. Terry also insufficiently
[*287]  condemns government complicity in camp militarization and in hijacking
aid, neglecting the fact that the real culprits in this story are governments
across the world, cynically manipulating the suffering of vulnerable populations
in crises to promote their own interests. Understanding the vital nature of
Terry's critiques of aid is impossible without appreciation of the full context
of other actors' responsibilities. Holding aid to impossibly high standards, she
catapults its failures to the forefront of international debate, without a
parallel challenge to the misdeeds of donor governments.

Slow march against AIDS: International conferences are an important weapon in
fighting virus

BYLINE: JANET BAGNALL, The Gazette

SECTION: NEWS; Janet Bagnall; Pg. A19

LENGTH: 766  words


When then-prime minister Brian Mulroney opened Canada's first international AIDS
conference in 1989, AIDS was a terrifying, deadly scourge. In Canada, dying AIDS
patients had their food trays left at the door to their hospital rooms. People
were afraid even to touch them. There was no cure.

On Sunday, the 16th International AIDS conference opens in Toronto, the third of
these conferences to be held in Canada. Between 1989 and 2006, much has changed.

With the advent of antiretroviral therapies 10 years ago, AIDS has slipped off
the radar in North America. In a world that can afford expensive drug therapies,
HIV/AIDS is no longer a death sentence.

AIDS instead seems to have become a Third World illness. In impoverished Africa,
AIDS is sweeping through entire populations, destroying families, economies and
social structures.

In sub-Saharan Africa, home to barely 10 per cent of the world's population,
more than 1,000 people die every day of AIDS. That figure represents nearly four
in every five deaths from AIDS around the world. Ninety-two per cent of the
children orphaned by AIDS are in sub-Saharan Africa. It is an unsustainable
burden for such a fragile area.

Botswana, with just 2 million inhabitants, is facing "extinction," its president
told a journalist in Africa recently. The journalist, Sue Armstrong, wrote that
life expectancy in Botswana dropped 25 years to below 40 by the early 2000s. It
will drop further, to 30, within four years unless the AIDS epidemic is stopped.

Faced with the unthinkable, Botswana has mounted the largest publicly funded
HIV/AIDS treatment program in the world. It has undertaken to provide
antiretroviral drugs to all who need them.

Providing treatment to everyone who needs it anywhere in the world is precisely
the course of action required if the HIV/AIDS epidemic is to be brought under
control, according to a research model carried out by the British Columbia
Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS, published in the Lancet.

B.C. researchers said their mathematical model showed that providing
antiretroviral therapy to every person in the world infected with HIV would stop
the epidemic within 50 years. The researchers proposed treating people who are
HIV-positive from the time of diagnosis rather than waiting until the person has
low CD4 cell counts. Low counts leave people open to infections of all kinds.
The cost would be about $7 billion a year.

Could money on this scale ever be available to treat a single illness? If it is
made available, it will certainly be in part because of the international AIDS
conferences. The conferences have served to keep the world informed.

As many as 24,000 participants will be arriving in the next few days at the
Toronto conference, 10 times as many as attended the first conference in Atlanta
in 1985.

Over the years, some participants have decided against attending these
conferences, not convinced that the science is worth the trip. Others worry that
donor fatigue will set in. Governments find other priorities. The urgency fades,
no matter how often Stephen Lewis, the UN special envoy on HIV/AIDS issues,
lectures "delinquent" Canadians.

Lewis flayed Canada for neglecting its promise of two years ago to supply
medicine to countries struggling with HIV/AIDS pandemic. The federal government
needs only to issue a licence for generic drugs, Lewis said this week. It hasn't
done that.

Here at home, the death rate from AIDS has fallen. In 1993, 1,564 Canadians died
from AIDS. In 2003, 440 died of AIDS. There are 58,000 people living with AIDS.
Of that total, an alarming number, an estimated 15,000 Canadians don't know that
they have HIV/AIDS.

North Americans are not taking AIDS seriously enough, warned Dr. Julio Montaner,
with the B.C. Centre for Excellence and considered one of the world's experts in
AIDS.

In Canada, like everywhere else in the world, HIV/AIDS strikes people on the
margins, intravenous drug users, women forced into unprotected sex. Yet Canada
will spend less than $10 million on prevention, a sum experts say is inadequate.

Would we all know any of this if it were not for the international HIV/AIDS
conference? We could find out, if we wanted, but that's not the same thing as
not being able to avoid the information. That alone makes the conferences
worthwhile.

More than 3 million people around the world die of HIV/AIDS every year.
Tuberculosis claims 2 million a year and malaria more than 1 million.

We need more international conferences, not fewer. Cures and treatment for
tuberculosis and malaria should also be championed at world forums.

Why the UK needs a stronger legal framework for aid spending;
To silence aid sceptics, the UK needs to strengthen legislation to meet a
rapidly shifting aid landscape, but where should it start?

BYLINE: Daniel Cullen and Ambreena Manji

SECTION: GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT PROFESSIONALS NETWORK

LENGTH: 1042 words


The existing legal framework for UK aid has its roots in the 1994 Pergau dam
case. A decision to fund a dam project in exchange for the securing of a major
arms deal with Malaysia was found be unlawful by the high court. Following this,
the International Development Act 2002 was introduced to ensure that, in future,
aid could not be used to further commercial and other interests. Aid can now
only be given only for the purposes of poverty reduction.

This law, along with the International Development (Reporting and Transparency)
Act, underpins much the UK's development activity. But this legal framework has
been criticised for its weakness because the term poverty reduction is too vague
to create strong accountability for aid. Law professor Patrick McAuslan argued
as long ago as 2003 that the UK does not have "an effective legal backbone to
the aid relationship". This allows Justine Greening, the international
development secretary, very wide discretion as to how aid is spent.

Then, last year, came the act that compels the UK to spend of 0.7% of gross
national income on overseas development assistance (ODA) each year. This was an
unprecedented commitment, and existing legislation has not caught up, leaving a
weak framework for accountability. While a number of bodies (the Independent
Commission for Aid Impact, the National Audit Office, and two parliamentary
committees) are mandated to scrutinise how UK aid is spent, spending is only
reviewed after projects have been implemented, not while decisions are being
made.

Today, ODA spending is at its highest ever level, with an estimated total of
£12.2bn disbursed during 2015. But at the same time, the wider environment of UK
aid spending has also been changing rapidly.

The most significant change in the UK aid landscape is the increasing
disbursement of funds by departments other than the Department for International
Development (DFID). An estimated total of £2.47bn in ODA was spent outside of
DFID during 2015, with the proportion spent via DFID itself falling from 89.5%
in 2011 to 79.8% in 2015.

The problem is, while DFID is required by the 2002 act to spend aid towards
poverty alleviation, the legal framework governing the ODA spending of other
departments is less clear. There is a risk that when aid is spread across
Whitehall, the legislative framework could prove wholly inadequate. The UK's
commitment to poverty reduction could be trumped by other considerations -
strategic, military and commercial - when spending aid. This danger has been
recognised by the International Development Committee (IDC), which recently
called on the government to "make reducing poverty a legal obligation for the
spending of all ODA, regardless of which department is spending it".

In November 2015 the government published a new strategy outlining its vision
for the future of UK aid spending. This document speaks of "aid spending in the
national interest", and sets out four objectives: strengthening global peace,
security and governance; strengthening resilience and crisis response; promoting
global prosperity; and - last of all - tackling extreme poverty.

The IDC has suggested that this approach could detract from the work of poverty
reduction. MP Stephen Twigg, chair of the committee, has pointed out that
poverty reduction no longer appears to be the UK's main priority: "The most
important principle of allocating UK aid should always be that it is allocated
to areas where it can most effectively be used to reduce poverty, which is
clearly in the UK's national interest."

It's clear the legislation governing UK aid spending is inadequate for the new
realities of the 0.7% commitment, the government's new aid strategy and a
rapidly shifting aid landscape. So what do we do about it?

The first and most urgent task is to pass legislation to provide for the growing
proportion of aid to be spent by non-DFID departments. Clarity is needed about
the duties of departments now disbursing ODA, such as the FCO, the MOD and BIS.

The aid work of these departments was not envisaged by the International
Development Act in 2002. To date, they have simply stated that they are guided
by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development guidelines on aid
spending. These provide that ODA must have the promotion of the economic
development and welfare of developing countries as its main objective, a much
broader provision than the requirement for poverty reduction under the
International Development Act.

Second, a much stronger mechanism for aid scrutiny could be forged by requiring
evaluation of aid decisions as they are made. Such a mechanism is in place under
the EU's financial regulation for example. It is used to assess the
cost-effectiveness of all proposed expenditure programmes or actions for the
union budget. Similar scrutiny of aid spending could be put in place.

Jonathan Isaby

On 13 June, parliament debated an online petition demanding a reduction in the
amount the UK spends each year on ODA, following a Mail on Sunday campaign that
gathered over 220,000 signatures. Faced with this vocal opposition, development
experts have so far shied away from looking critically at aid spending. Instead
they have focused on the positive impact of aid. But to be able to make a strong
case for aid, its advocates also need to pay close attention to the detail of
aid governance. Otherwise, without a robust legal framework governing aid, it
will continue to be possible for sceptics to cast doubt on the important work of
tackling global poverty.

rapidly shifting aid landscape. So what do we do about it?

The first and most urgent task is to pass legislation to provide for the growing
proportion of aid to be spent by non-DFID departments. Clarity is needed about
the duties of departments now disbursing ODA, such as the FCO, the MOD and BIS.

The aid work of these departments was not envisaged by the International
Development Act in 2002. To date, they have simply stated that they are guided
by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development guidelines on aid
spending. These provide that ODA must have the promotion of the economic
development and welfare of developing countries as its main objective, a much
broader provision than the requirement for poverty reduction under the
International Development Act.

Second, a much stronger mechanism for aid scrutiny could be forged by requiring
evaluation of aid decisions as they are made. Such a mechanism is in place under
the EU's financial regulation for example. It is used to assess the
cost-effectiveness of all proposed expenditure programmes or actions for the
union budget. Similar scrutiny of aid spending could be put in place.

On 13 June, parliament debated an online petition demanding a reduction in the
amount the UK spends each year on ODA, following a Mail on Sunday campaign that
gathered over 220,000 signatures. Faced with this vocal opposition, development
experts have so far shied away from looking critically at aid spending. Instead
they have focused on the positive impact of aid. But to be able to make a strong
case for aid, its advocates also need to pay close attention to the detail of
aid governance. Otherwise, without a robust legal framework governing aid, it
will continue to be possible for sceptics to cast doubt on the important work of
tackling global poverty.

Why the UK needs a stronger legal framework for aid spending;
To silence aid sceptics, the UK needs to strengthen legislation to meet a
rapidly shifting aid landscape, but where should it start?

The existing legal framework for UK aid has its roots in the 1994 Pergau dam
case. A decision to fund a dam project in exchange for the securing of a major
arms deal with Malaysia was found be unlawful by the high court. Following this,
the International Development Act 2002 was introduced to ensure that, in future,
aid could not be used to further commercial and other interests. Aid can now
only be given only for the purposes of poverty reduction.

This law, along with the international development (reporting and transparency)
bill, underpins much the UK's development activity. But this legal framework has
been criticised for its weakness because the term poverty reduction is too vague
to create strong accountability for aid. Law professor Patrick McAuslan argued
as long ago as 2003 that the UK does not have "an effective legal backbone to
the aid relationship". This allows Justine Greening, the international
development secretary, very wide discretion as to how aid is spent.

Then, last year, came the act that compels the UK to spend of 0.7% of gross
national income on overseas development assistance (ODA) each year. This was an
unprecedented commitment, and existing legislation has not caught up, leaving a
weak framework for accountability. While a number of bodies (the Independent
Commission for Aid Impact, the National Audit Office, and two parliamentary
committees) are mandated to scrutinise how UK aid is spent, spending is only
reviewed after projects have been implemented, not while decisions are being
made.

Today, ODA spending is at its highest ever level, with an estimated total of
£12.2bn disbursed during 2015. But at the same time, the wider environment of UK
aid spending has also been changing rapidly.

The most significant change in the UK aid landscape is the increasing
disbursement of funds by departments other than the Department for International
Development (DFID). An estimated total of £2.47bn in ODA was spent outside of
DFID during 2015, with the proportion spent via DFID itself falling from 89.5%
in 2011 to 79.8% in 2015.

The problem is, while DFID is required by the 2002 act to spend aid towards
poverty alleviation, the legal framework governing the ODA spending of other
departments is less clear. There is a risk that when aid is spread across
Whitehall, the legislative framework could prove wholly inadequate. The UK's
commitment to poverty reduction could be trumped by other considerations -
strategic, military and commercial - when spending aid. This danger has been
recognised by the International Development Committee (IDC), which recently
called on the government to "make reducing poverty a legal obligation for the
spending of all ODA, regardless of which department is spending it".

In November 2015 the government published a new strategy outlining its vision
for the future of UK aid spending. This document speaks of "aid spending in the
national interest", and sets out four objectives: strengthening global peace,
security and governance; strengthening resilience and crisis response; promoting
global prosperity; and - last of all - tackling extreme poverty.

The IDC has suggested that this approach could detract from the work of poverty
reduction. MP Stephen Twigg, chair of the committee, has pointed out that
poverty reduction no longer appears to be the UK's main priority: "The most
important principle of allocating UK aid should always be that it is allocated
to areas where it can most effectively be used to reduce poverty, which is
clearly in the UK's national interest."

It's clear the legislation governing UK aid spending is inadequate for the new
realities of the 0.7% commitment, the government's new aid strategy and a
rapidly shifting aid landscape. So what do we do about it?

The first and most urgent task is to pass legislation to provide for the growing

Ensuring access of the poor to justice through legal aid mechanism

LENGTH: 990 words

DATELINE: Bangladesh


Bangladesh, May 9 -- Bangladesh is a developing country where respect and
awareness regarding social justice and human rights are still at a low level.
The condition is worse for the underprivileged mainly among the char and haor
people, indigenous groups, ethnic and religious minorities, women, children and
hardcore poor people. They are the victims of socio-economic and public
injustice.

EQUALITY BEFORE LAW AND LEGAL AID: The Constitution ensures that all citizens
are equal before law and are entitled to have equal protection of law. But the
reality is different. A large number of people are not financially solvent nor
do they have any other logistic support to get the appropriate service from the
judicial system. In this way, protection by law and access to law have remained
only on paper as an indigent person finds him/herself helpless in police custody
or jail and he/she cannot afford a lawyer to defend himself/herself.

Legal aid is a tool for ensuring access to justice for those who are unable to
afford legal advice or legal representation in formal courts.

PROVISION OF LEGAL AID IN INTERNATIONAL INSTRUMENTS: In criminal matters, the
provision of legal aid is recognised throughout the world. The right to get
legal aid has been recognised as human rights which are implicit in Articles 7,
8 and 10 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), 1948 and is more
clearly stated in clause 3 (d) of Article 14 of the International Covenant on
Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), 1966. Article 7 of the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights, 1948 provides that all are equal before law and are entitled
without any discrimination to equal protection of the law.

According to Article 6 (3) (c) of the European Convention for the Protection of
Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, 1950 the right to free legal aid to a
person charged in a criminal case is ensured. Besides, the United Nations
Conference on the Prevention of Crime and Treatment of Offenders, 1965 and the
International Conference on Human Rights, 1968 (the Tehran Conference)
incorporated the provisions of legal aid in criminal matters with due
importance. Some other international instruments provided provisions of legal
aid in criminal matters. For example, the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights, 1966 provides for legal aid in criminal matters under Articles
14 (3) (d), 6 (1), 20(1). The Commonwealth of Independent States Convention on
Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, 1995 contain similar provisions as
article 7 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Article 24 of the
American Convention on Human Rights, 1978 declares that all persons are equal
before law and consequently, they are entitled, without any discrimination, to
equal protection by law.

LEGAL AID MOVEMENT IN BANGLADESH: The government has played a pioneering role in
the legal aid movement in the country. In order to ensure access of the poor and
indigent people to justice, the Legal Aid Services Act (LASA) in 2000.
Thereafter, the National Legal Aid Services Organisation (NLASO) was
established.

Legal services provided by NLASO include: Legal advice; Free vocalatnama;
Lawyers to help in a legal proceeding; Fees for lawyers; Fees for the mediator
or arbitrator; certified copies of order, judgment, etc. free of cost; cost of
DNA test; cost of paper advertisement in CR case; any other assistance along
with expenses for a case. Any poor person in the country is entitled to get free
legal aid services. Besides, any individual receiving old age allowance,
distressed mother holding a VGD card, women and children victims of trafficking
and acid throwing, insolvent widow, abandoned or distressed women, disabled
person and poor detainees can avail the free legal aid services.

ADMINISTRATION OF LEGAL AID SERVICES IN BANGLADESH: The Bangladesh Legal Aid
Services Act 2000 provides help at national and district level. There are a
National Legal Aid Board at national level, District Legal Aid Committees at
district level, Upazilla Legal Aid Committees at Upazilla level and Union Legal
Aid Committees at union level.

Besides the National Legal Aid Organisation, there are some Non-governmental
Organisations (NGOs) in the country who also provide legal aid to the poor. Most
of the Human Rights NGOs provide legal aid to aggrieved individuals. Among these
NGOs, Bangladesh Legal Aid and Services Trust (BLAST), Bangladesh National Women
Lawyers Association (BNWLA), Human Rights Commission (HRC), BRAC and Light House
(LH) are playing the lead role in providing legal aid services in the country.

TOWARDS MEANINGFUL COLLABORATION: The legal empowerment of underprivileged
people is increasing day by day. Good relation and meaningful coordination
between the government legal aid providers and NGOs can bring good results and
create impacts in the lives of the poor and vulnerable people.

CONSIDERING THE KEY FACTOR: Legal aid is a mechanism to establish equality in
society. The government has taken initiative to provide this assistance to the
poor people and has created a law for this purpose and taken many schemes to
implement these laws through government and NGOs efforts. But laws alone are not
enough to ensure the proper implementation of the government and non-government
initiatives. Public awareness must be raised to get the fruits of legal aid
system. A greater collaboration between the government and NGOs may ensure
better implementation of the legal aid provisions and thus greater access of the
poor people to justice.

Free legal aid program sees expansion

BYLINE: Zhang Yan

LENGTH: 1367  words


Qin Zhihui, better known by his online alias Qin Huohuo, became "famous" for
spreading rumors.

Justice Ministry plans to increase the number of people and cases that qualify
for assistance

Chang'an (second from right). Wang, who lives in Gaoling county, asked for legal
advice after being injured. Liu Xiao / Xinhua

Qin Zhihui, better known by his online alias Qin Huohuo, became "famous" for
spreading rumors.

From 2011 to 2013, the former employee of a Beijing marketing and planning
company fabricated stories on 10 micro blogs to attract public attention. He
slandered celebrities, including popular television hosts Yang Lan and China
Disabled Persons' Federation President Zhang Haidi, and he posted a comment
saying the government had paid more than 200 million yuan ($32.2 million) to
compensate a foreign victim who died in a 2011 train incident in Wenzhou,
Zhejiang province - a fabrication.

The 30-year-old said he did all of this to seek fame and fortune. But when he
was arrested in 2013, the young man from a poor family did not have enough money
for a lawyer, so he applied for free legal aid and was accepted.

What surprised him was that the designated lawyer tried her best to help him get
lenient punishment.

"I didn't expect I would get lenient punishment, considering the bad social
influence of my case," said Qin, who was sentenced in Beijing Chaoyang People's
Court in April 2014 to three years in prison for defamation and causing trouble.

"The lawyer actively defended me during the court hearing, and the court
accepted some of her defense opinions when handing down the prison term."

Sun Xiaoyang, the designated lawyer for Qin, was paid only 2,000 yuan from the
Beijing Legal Aid Center for her service in Qin's case, but she said money was
not her concern. "What I care about most is helping people in need to obtain
their legal rights rather than seeking benefits," she said.

After Qin was detained in September 2013, Sun immediately applied to meet him in
the detention house to tell him his legal rights and learn about the case. She
met with Qin more than 10 times during the whole legal process. She went to the
prosecuting department to read the case files, actively exchange evidence and
discuss her concerns with prosecutors before the court hearing to streamline the
issues and exclude illegal evidence.

"The difficulty I encountered was more technical - there were lots of electronic
documents and I needed to compare them with each other to discover the
differences and flaws to provide new evidence to the court," she said.

Qin was one of the more than 1 million people who received free legal aid
services last year.

Cases go up 9 percent

Statistics provided by the Ministry of Justice show that national legal aid
departments under local justice authorities concluded 1.24 million legal aid
cases last year, and offered aid to 1.39 million people, a year-on-year increase
of 9 percent. Meanwhile, the amount of legal aid funding reached 1.7 billion
yuan last year, an increase of 4.8 percent compared with 2013.

As China transforms its political and economic growth model, social conflicts
are rising sharply, and the interests of vulnerable groups are at stake. Zhao
Dacheng, vice-minister of justice, said the ministry has been trying to improve
the 20-year-old legal aid system, and one of the big moves is to lower the
threshold and expand the number of people who can receive free legal aid in a
bid to protect their rights.

Free legal aid will now be extended to those involved in civil disputes and
criminal cases involving people's livelihoods, such as marriage and family, food
safety, education and healthcare, he said.

Meanwhile, people with very low incomes and those who don't hire lawyers will
also be eligible for free legal aid, he said.

The moves are in response to a key meeting hosted by President Xi Jinping in
May. According to the meeting, legal aid is an important livelihood project, and
the protection of people's rights and interests should be taken as the new
starting and ending points.

"The purpose of improving legal aid is to expand the scope of free aid services
and improve its quality so that eligible people will get legal aid and have
equal access to justice," Xi said at the meeting.

In June, authorities issued a notice that listed measures for this goal, which
can better protect people's legitimate rights, Zhao said.

"Now, once suspects are detained by the police, lawyers can immediately meet
with them in the detention house to offer legal assistance. ... But before, once
criminals were detained, the lawyers had no means to meet or get in contact with
them for 48 hours," he said.

"In the past, the police also wouldn't tell the lawyers about progress in the
investigation, which seriously violates suspects' legal rights. Now, once
suspects are captured, lawyers will provide them free legal aid services during
the whole judicial procedure, such as police interrogation, prosecution and
court sentencing to protect their human rights."

In addition to expanding the number of people eligible for legal aid, another
measure listed in the notice is to broaden people's access to legal aid.
According to Sun Jian-ying, director of the ministry's legal aid department,
3,700 legal aid centers have been set up across the country, with more than
4,700 lawyers offering free legal aid services, including providing legal
consultation, representing criminal cases and mediating civil disputes.

Now, the ministry plans to set up more legal aid working stations in local
detention houses and courts.

To date, more than 1,500 legal aid working offices have been established in
detention houses across the country, and the ministry will set up local legal
aid working stations in the pilot courts to offer legal consultation to the
parties involved in appeal cases, she said.

People who are unable to move easily, such as the elderly and the disabled, can
use the hotline 12348 or the websites of local legal aid departments, she said.

Websites and hotlines have proved to be effective tools for people with demands
for legal aid. According to statistics provided by the ministry, 6.8 million
people applied for legal assistance last year, and most of them sought
consultations through the websites or hotline.

In Jiangsu and Hubei provinces and Beijing, justice departments now regularly
publicize legal aid information on their micro blogs or WeChat accounts.
Designated lawyers also offer legal consulting on these social media platforms,
she said.

Li Xuelian, a senior official at the ministry's legal aid department, said that
among the legal aid services they handled, more than 80 percent were civil
cases, with most related to payment and employment disputes, marriage and
domestic affairs and traffic accidents. Others were criminal cases and
administrative litigation.

The notice also highlighted the priority of accelerating legislation for the
country's legal aid service.

Quality control encouraged

When the legislation is complete, "appropriate authorities could clarify their
tasks and work closely to improve the quality and professionalism of legal
assistance and protect people's legitimate rights", said Zheng Huiyun, director
of the Beijing Legal Aid Department.

She said the application procedures for legal aid services should be regulated,
and more effort should be devoted to evaluating the quality of legal aid
services and the mechanism for handling complaints from recipients of legal aid.

In addition, authorities, including the Ministry of Finance, should invest
special funds to support the legal aid program and increase lawyers' subsidies
for legal assistance. At present, a lawyer only receives an average of 1,500
yuan for a civil case and 1,200 yuan for a criminal case, she said.

According to Sun of the legal aid department, the ministry plans to invest at
least 400 million yuan to support legal aid this year, and it also plans to
increase lawyers' subsidies for legal assistance.

Sun said the legal aid departments under local justice authorities will also
establish an online updated database of legal aid recipients.

Everything you'll ever need to know about Legal Aid in Northern Ireland

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 56

LENGTH: 734 words


Justice Minister David Ford has just published the Access to Justice Report. The
report looks at how people can access the best form of representation and what
is the the appropriate level of legal representation for their particular set of
circumstances.

This is part of a wider reform by David Ford of the justice system, to create a
justice system in Northern Ireland that meets the needs of the people of
Northern Ireland.

He is committed to the principle of people having access to justice and where
there is a need, for Government to pay for that access through legal aid.

Legal aid is the means by which Government provides financial assistance to
persons who could not otherwise afford legal advice or representation for court
proceedings.

In some instances legal aid is available free of charge and in others the person
receiving assistance is required to pay a contribution to its cost.

Legal aid enables application of the principle of equality before the law and
assists the Government in meeting its obligations under the human rights
legislation, specifically the right to a fair trial.

THE LEGAL AID SCHEME

The Legal Aid Scheme in Northern Ireland covers legal advice, assistance and
representation in both civil and criminal proceedings. The Legal Aid Scheme is
demand led, therefore, any person who meets the statutory tests, as to their
financial means and the merits of their case, will receive legal aid. There are
broadly five types of legal aid, as follows: 1. Legal Advice and Assistance; 2.
Assistance By Way of Representation; 3. Children Order; 4. Civil Legal Aid; and
5. Criminal Legal Aid.

1. Legal Advice and Assistance

Legal Advice and Assistance, popularly known as the 'Green Form'' scheme, allows
a person to obtain preliminary legal advice from a solicitor on any point of
Northern Ireland law if they are financially eligible.

2. Assistance By Way of Representation

Assistance By Way of Representation (ABWOR) is an extension of the Advice and
Assistance scheme and allows a solicitor, and in some instances a barrister, to
provide representation to an assisted person in a number of civil proceedings in
the magistrates'' court (for example, proceedings concerning domestic violence
and matters relating to children) and for proceedings before the Mental Health
Review Tribunal and the Parole Commissioners. Approval for ABWOR is determined
by the Northern Ireland Legal Services Commission. There is usually a financial
eligibility test to be met in order to receive ABWOR.

3. Children Order

Funding for Children Order proceedings is provided by way of ABWOR or civil
legal aid depending on the tier of court which the proceedings are before. ABWOR
and civil legal aid is provided without a financial eligibility test in special
Children Order proceedings (for example, emergency child protection
proceedings). In other Children Order proceedings, the financial eligibility
tests are applied and contributions may be payable by the assisted person.

4. Civil Legal Aid

Civil Legal Aid provides legal representation in civil court proceedings,
primarily in the County Court and in the High Court. Civil Legal Aid allows a
person to obtain legal representation by a solicitor and a barrister(s), either
to bring or to defend a court case. Civil Legal Aid is granted by the Northern
Ireland Legal Services Commission. This scheme has a financial eligibility test
and contributions may be payable by the assisted person.

5. Criminal Legal Aid

Criminal Legal Aid provides free legal representation to an accused person
facing criminal proceedings, primarily in the magistrates'' court and the Crown
Court. (Criminal Legal Aid is also available for appeals to the County Court and
the Court of Appeal following conviction in the magistrates'' court and Crown
Court, respectively.) To obtain free Criminal Legal Aid, the accused is required
to meet two tests, namely that it is in the interests of justice that free legal
aid should be granted and that the accused has insufficient means to pay for his
own legal aid. Criminal Legal Aid is granted by the judiciary and no financial
contribution is required from any person granted Criminal Legal Aid.

Other

For persons and proceedings not covered by the five types of legal aid set out
above, there is a statutory exceptional grant legal aid scheme. This scheme has
been used to fund representation for relatives of the deceased at inquest
hearings.

Share of grants in aid declining

LENGTH: 567 words

DATELINE: Dhaka


Dhaka, June 18 -- A significant change has taken place in case of the total aid
package to Bangladesh over the years since independence as the share of grants
declined gradually. "The decreasing volume of grants has resulted in a larger
proportion of loans in the total aid package," said an official at the Economic
Relations Division (ERD). He said the share of grants dropped to 28.69 percent
in the 2009-10 fiscal from 35.6 percent disbursed in fiscal 2008-09. The share
of grants to the country's total aid was 88.2 percent in 1972-73 fiscal, 53.2
per cent in 1979-80 fiscal and 55.4 per cent in 1984-85 fiscal. The ERD official
said external assistance is considered a significant factor in the economic
development in order to bridge the gap between savings and investments and
balance of payment. Up to June 30 in 2010, nearly $ 64.46 billion in external
assistance was committed.

Of the total amount, 10.49 per cent was food aid, 17.18 per cent commodity aid
and 72.33 per cent project aid, according to the latest ERD figures on the flow
of external resources. Of the committed amount up to June 30 in 2010,
disbursement of foreign aid was about $ 52.59 billion - grants 42.97 percent and
loans 57.03 percent. Talking to UNB over phone, Center for Policy Dialogue (CPD)
executive director Dr. Mustafizur Rahman said that as the country's economy
would continue to mature, the inflow of grants as well as grant element in loans
would decrease. He said that as Bangladesh's economy is emerging as a matured
economy, the trend of grants inflow would gradually decline. "It implies that
now we'll have to increase our debt servicing capability." Dr Mustafiz said the
government could go for more loans from the International Development
Association (IDA), concessionary arm of the World Bank, as its charge on loans
is good as also the grace period. According to the flow of external resources,
if foreign aid is classified by purpose, 12.52 percent was disbursed as food aid
, 20.74 percent as commodity aid and 66.74 per cent as project aid. Bilateral
aid, which was 75.4 percent of the total aid in 1973-78 fiscal, decreased to
17.1 percent in 2009-10 fiscal. However, multilateral aid has grown from 24.6
percent to almost 82.9 per cent over the same period. Furthermore, the flow of
food aid and commodity aid has declined drastically. Food aid has declined
consistently from 47.9 percent of total aid in 1971-72 to 4.19 percent in fiscal
2009-10. Commodity aid has similarly fallen from 50.8 percent to nil during the
same period, while project aid increased sharply from 1.3 percent to 95.81 per
cent over the period. Among the bilateral donors, Japan tops the list in terms
of cumulative disbursement to Bangladesh, followed by USA and Canada. IDA, the
soft lending window of the World Bank, is the largest amongst the multilateral
development institutions, followed by the Asian Development Bank. The ERD
official said that projects having co-financiers are usually more complex and
demand greater attention than those financed by a single source. Sometimes rigid
conditions create difficulties in the speedy implementation of projects or in
the utilization of economic assistance, he said. Published by HT Syndication

With Record Rise in Foreign Aid Comes Change in How It Is Monitored

BYLINE:   By ELIZABETH BECKER

SECTION: Section 1; Column 1; Foreign Desk; Pg. 10

LENGTH: 964 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 6


With Congress set to increase foreign development aid to the world's poorest
nations by nearly $2 billion, President Bush is overseeing the biggest increase
in development assistance since 1962 -- the year after President John F. Kennedy
created the Peace Corps and the Alliance for Progress in South America.

With most of that money aimed at combating H.I.V. and AIDS and creating a new
development program, Africa would be the main beneficiary of this latest
expansion in foreign aid.

In a turnaround that caught even Democrats by surprise, Republican lawmakers
followed Mr. Bush's lead and agreed to nearly double the amount ofaid money
going to Africa. The expansion appeals to domestic constituents like the
Christian right and to foreign allies who have complained for years that the
United States has been far too stingy with its foreign aid budget.

"This is a very big moment for H.I.V./AIDS and foreign aid," said Stephen
Morrison, director of the the Africa Program at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies and a State Department official under President Bill
Clinton.

"No one would have predicted that the United States would be putting out this
money for AIDS and foreign development," he said.

Under President Kennedy, foreign aid for the poorest countries jumped by $4
billion, to $12.5 billion in 1962. This year Congress will add $2 billion,
bringing the budget to $8.6 billion, according to figures from the Congressional
Research Service, making it the largest increase in developmental and civilian
foreign aid programs in four decades.

The impetus behind Mr. Bush's new aid programs has been the fear of global
terrorism after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks as well as the looming shadow of the
AIDS pandemic.

In his 2002 National Security Strategy, Mr. Bush warned against allowing Africa
to become impoverished and a home to terrorists.

With strong urgings from Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, Condoleezza Rice,
the president's national security adviser, and the Irish rock star Bono, Mr.
Bush used his State of the Union address this year to announce an increase in
financing for combating H.I.V. and AIDS by $15 billion over the next five years.

At a conference last year in Monterrey, Mexico, he promised to increase
America's foreign aid budget by 15 percent a year -- or $5 billion over three
years, the first real expansion in more than a decade.

But Republican lawmakers had to be convinced that new aid money would not be
misspent by corrupt foreign governments.

So the administration sidestepped the normal route of giving the money to the
United States Agency for International Development and, instead, created a new
program called the Millennium Challenge Account, which requires poor nations to
meet criteria of good government to receive aid.

Joshua Bolten, the director of the Office of Management and Budget and the
president's former deputy chief of staff, helped develop the new aid strategy.

Mr. Bolten said the president was willing to put $10 billion over three years
into a new development program because of this "sea change in how foreign aid is
targeted."

"Money will now be given to countries that have shown a willingness to establish
an environment where foreign aid will be most effective," Mr. Bolten said in an
interview on Wednesday.

Patrick Cronin, a former assistant administrator at the Agency for International
Development, who helped create the new programs, said this approach was
necessary.

"This really was like Nixon going to China because Republicans have always been
the most skeptical about foreign aid," said Mr. Cronin.

But experts worry that adding yet another new agency to the number of aid groups
already giving out federal money overseas could create confusion and
inefficiency.

Lael Brainard, a scholar at the Brookings Institution and a member of the
National Economic Council under President Clinton, said it could also undermine
established agencies like the development agency.

"This is a terrible blow to U.S.A.I.D., a vote of no confidence in how they are
giving out aid," said Ms. Brainard.

Bono, the lead singer for U2 who lent his name and reputation to the White House
in order to promote these changes, had grumbled in September that the
administration and Congress were slow at handing out the money promised earlier
by Mr. Bush.

But now that Congress has agreed on $1 billion for the new aid program and $2.4
billion for AIDS, he came to Washington this week to praise the Republican-led
Congress and Mr. Bush for keeping their word to nearly double the amount of aid
flowing to Africa.

With Congress in recess, the final approval for the spending measures could come
as early as next week. However, it is unclear whether the Senate will vote on
any legislation until January.

With accountability being the most prominent feature of his new aid programs,
said a senior administration official, the president called in prominent
lawmakers for help in convincing Congress that foreign aid would not be lost to
corruption or incompetence and would bring measurable results. "It's not just a
question of putting more money into fighting AIDS but that we come up with a way
to really turn the tide on this disease," said the official.

The Senate majority leader, Bill Frist of Tennessee, made that argument when he
led a delegation of six Republican senators to southern Africa in August. "They
saw a number of effective organizations that were truly making a difference and
recognized the importance of more funding," said Nick Smith, a spokesman for Dr.
Frist.

But it has taken the administration 20 months to draw up the outline for this
new development agency. Even if the money were passed next week, the
administration has yet to set up the Millennium Challenge Corporation to run the
programs.

million is to help fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria in Africa. The increase
is not "mostly" to fight AIDS in Africa.

Hospitals still biased against people with HIV/AIDS'

SECTION: National; Pg. 5

LENGTH: 476 words

DATELINE: Kuala Lumpur


KUALA LUMPUR, Wed. - Hospital authorities are still biased and practise
discrimination in rendering services to people with HIV/AIDS.

President of the Malaysian AIDS Council and chairman of the Malaysian
AIDS Foundation Datin Paduka Marina Mahathir said the organisations had
received complaints from quite a number of patients.

The patients alleged that they were turned away by hopitals because
medical practitioners refused to treat them.

The council, she said, would report all the allegations to the Health
Ministry, including that of an AIDS patient who recently died in a
hospital after being refused treatment.

"It is the duty of medical practitioners or hospitals to take in
patients, regardless of their backgrounds, for further treatment or
diagnosis."

Marina said this to reporters during a Press conference held to
publicise International AIDS Memorial Day.

She said there should be more concerted efforts from all parties to
educate the public on AIDS.

Marina said doctors and nurses should shoulder the responsibility for
the counselling and management of HIV/AIDS cases.

She added that society's discrimination would force AIDS victims and HIV
carriers in the country to live in isolation.

"Discrimination and derision by villagers had even forced the council to
help save AIDS victims and their families by relocating them and their
children," she said.

She added that in some cases, the foundation could not find a house or
even land to build its hospice for homeless people with AIDS because
people would object on hearing that the centre was for treating AIDS
victims.

Marina added that what was needed was for society to respond with
compassion and be more supportive towards HIV/AIDS patients and mobilise
community-based responses to the disease.

At the Press conference earlier, Marina said many special events had
been planned by the Malaysian AIDS Foundation and the Malaysian AIDS
Council to commemorate the 14th AIDS Memorial Day to be observed in
Malaysia from May 1.

The theme Value Every Life, Honour Every Death was selected in order to
urge the Government, society as well as the private sector to support
policies and laws which promote access to basic health care services,
affordable treatment for AIDS victims as well as the reduction of the
stigma of HIV/AIDS.

The events lined up include a three-day AIDS awareness and mobilisation
programme at Central Market, the AIDS Film Festival to be held at the
British Council on May 2 and 3 and an exhibition of art therapy work by
HIV/AIDS victims at Galeri Wan, Bangsar.

The climax of the events is the World Aids Memorial Night 1997 concert
at Dataran Merdeka on May 4, to be opened by Culture, Arts and Tourism
Minister Datuk Sabbaruddin Chik.

All the events are open to the public and admission is free.

Reaction swift, strong, divided on Thurman as new AIDS czar;
As an activist and bureaucrat, she has political ties that are lauded and
doubted.

BYLINE: M.A.J. McKenna; STAFF WRITER

SECTION: LOCAL NEWS; Pg. 05A

LENGTH: 605 words


The reaction Monday to the announcement that Atlanta's Sandra Thurman would be
President Clinton's AIDS czar was noticeable and political - just like the woman
herself.

Former colleagues hailed her hard work and fund-raising muscle, and longtime
opponents renewed criticism of what they called inappropriate spending and
excessive political ties.

"Thurman might have been a good bureaucrat, but she certainly was no leader in
the war on AIDS," said Roger Garza, Atlanta representative of the advocacy group
ACT-UP.

"Sandy was a gift to this community and to this agency at any price," countered
Ken Britt, current chairman of AID Atlanta.

A former executive director of AID Atlanta, Thurman was known for her
directness, humor and distinctive style: She kept a Wedgwood teacup full of
multicolored condoms on her desk and once dressed up as a drag queen for a
fund-raiser.

But she was also a lifelong Democratic Party insider: daughter of Marge Thurman,
former head of the Georgia Democratic Party; friend of James Carville, Clinton's
former political strategist; and a campaigner herself for Clinton, which last
fall led to being chair of his post- election victory bash in Little Rock.

Until recently, Thurman was a member of the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV
and AIDS.

On Monday, local AIDS experts said they hoped Thurman's political ties would
help AIDS treatment in Atlanta.

"Sandy is very knowledgeable of the issues surrounding provision of AIDS-related
services," said Dr. Melanie Thompson, principal investigator at the AIDS
Research Consortium of Atlanta. "She is very knowledgeable of the issues that
exist for AIDS service organizations in the Atlanta area, and we hope that her
appointment will be positive for Georgia, increasing funding and access to
services and research."

Thurman, 43, who was mentioned as a contender for the AIDS position in 1993 and
1994, was director of public affairs at AID Atlanta from 1982 through 1988. She
became the agency's first heterosexual executive director in 1989 and stayed
until 1993, when she left to head the Carter Center's Task Force for Child
Survival and Development.

While at AID Atlanta, she was credited with turning around a broke and
demoralized agency, coordinating fund-raisers so successful that they not only
plumped AID Atlanta's coffers but allowed the group to hand out pilot grants to
other local providers.

Her fund-raising success wasn't universally applauded. At the time, other local
groups complained that the agency was taking an unfair share of AIDS funding
without disclosing how it was spending the money.

That criticism was renewed Monday by ACT-UP, which in press releases to the
media Monday called her a "bland bureaucrat" and accused her of misspending
funds at AID Atlanta.

The local agency quickly fired back. "During her tenure, she quadrupled our
budget through aggressively advocating for AIDS funding," Britt said, "and
increased our capacity to serve the community through increasing the staff from
13 to 90 people."

In a statement released Monday by her former employer, Thurman sketched out what
she hopes to do as director to reinvigorate the neglected Office of National
AIDS Policy.

"I have an understanding of what it takes to work in the front lines in the
battle against AIDS," she said. "For 13 years, I've worked as a volunteer
helping people with AIDS on an individual basis, and as an administrator. This
privilege has allowed me to hear and understand the needs of the community,
because I've been there.

"This is not simply policy for me," she added. "This is personal."

Ceremony marks World AIDS Day Students, parents offer 'paper prayers' of love

BYLINE: Donovan Vincent Toronto Star

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A3

LENGTH: 577 words


   Pierre, you were very brave.

We're still trying to find a cure for AIDS. Sleep well.

It was a simple and poignant message, written on a piece of paper and draped
with many others to flutter on a small tree in Nathan Phillips Square.

They were hung during a quiet ceremony yesterday to mark World AIDS Day, held
since 1988 in memory of those who have the killer disease or HIV, the virus that
causes it.

A small crowd of students, teachers and parents joined together to hang the
messages they made, in keeping with the Japanese tradition of offering painted
strips of paper prayers to sustain good health and to cure the sick.

Teresa Castellvi said husband Enrique and their two children, Cristina and
Enrique Jr., designed paper prayers for their neighbor Pierre.

"He was our family friend. He died of AIDS three years ago," she said.

Toronto Mayor Barbara Hall helped elementary students from West Preparatory
school and Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic school hang their prayers from the tree.

Their efforts were joined by men and women around the world, acting together as
UNAIDS, a United Nations agency, reported an accelerating death toll, with
nearly one-quarter of the 6.4 million AIDS deaths so far occurring in the last
year.

To protest government inaction, some 50 demonstrators dumped empty medicine
bottles outside the office of Bill Graham, the Liberal Member of Parliament for
Rosedale on Friday.

"These empty pill bottles are as useless to us as empty promises," said Tim
McCaskell, a member of the steering committee of AIDS Action Now.

"For the people living with AIDS in Canada, this is a day of shame," he said.

In 1996, 3.1 million people worldwide were infected with HIV, bringing the total
number of people with HIV or AIDS to 22.6 million, UNAIDS said.

Canada has 14,185 confirmed cases.

Meanwhile, organizers of the Red Ribbon Campaign, which raises money for AIDS
research, decided to extend the drive after donations dropped by $20,000 - the
first drop since the drive began.

In an attempt to reach the $156,000 goal, campaign manager Pam Beavis said,
volunteers will continue to solicit funds until Friday.

Around the world, activists in China posted photos of an emaciated AIDS victim
in Beijing's central Zhongshan Park. Gas stations in Thailand - a hotbed of
prostitution - distributed 3 million condoms with the warning "Be careful of
AIDS when feeling naughty."

The Philippines held its first National AIDS walk in Manila, the capital, and in
Taipei, a Taiwanese AIDS-awareness group displayed memorial quilt patches to
honor AIDS victims.

Photo exhibitions carried the message in India, which volunteer organizations
said has - with 1 million or more confirmed HIV cases - Asia's worst AIDS
epidemic.

In Rome, two taxi companies distributed AIDS information leaflets to passengers
and included similar messages on their telephone answering service. Some of
Italy's top soccer players wore red bows on their uniforms.

In South Africa, retired Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who won the Nobel
Peace Prize in 1984 for his fight against apartheid, warned in a TV ad: "Our
country faces a crisis with HIV and AIDS spreading so fast. Please use a
condom!"

In central Paris, several hundred AIDS activists marched with signs reading "
AIDS: The Epidemic Isn't Over," and "Zero Equals the Number of AIDS Survivors."

FACTS NEEDED, NOT EMOTION;
The politicization of the AIDS issue heightens paranoia and increases risk

BYLINE: ROWLAND NETHAWAY

SECTION: EDITORIAL; Pg. 09A

LENGTH: 615 words


Waco, Texas a The struggle to combat AIDS should be treated with more facts and
less politics.

In recent days the military announced it wants to discharge all uniformed
carriers of the AIDS virus, HIV-positive superstar Magic Johnson decided to come
out of retirement and former heavyweight champ Tommy Morrison got a knockout
blow to his career when he discovered that he is infected with the AIDS virus.

In each case, it was the political component of the disease that got the most
attention, not the facts. The fight against AIDS needs more facts and less
politics. But it is the politics of AIDS that prevents people from learning more
facts about the disease.

AIDS is an epidemic. Some experts describe it more grandly as pandemic. AIDS is
a relentless killer with no cure. It continues to spread throughout the United
States and the world.

But due to politics, AIDS is not treated like other sexually transmitted
diseases, much less other deadly epidemics. America's medical community leaves
no stone unturned to report cases of syphilis or gonorrhea. The sexual partners
are contacted in an effort to prevent the spread of the diseases that are seldom
deadly.

Not only is AIDS fatal, but it is even more dangerous because people carry the
virus for up to 10 years or more without developing symptoms of the disease.
Since politics prevents the testing and tracking epidemiologists employ in other
diseases, Americans can only cross their fingers and guess at how far the virus
has spread throughout society.

"I don't know if I got it from a girl or fighting," Morrison told a reporter.
"It doesn't matter how I got it. I'm going to do everything I can to educate
people."

The political component of the AIDS struggle immediately grabbed every
microphone in sight to belittle concerns about contracting the AIDS virus while
boxing. Why should people in such a brutal sport worry about getting AIDS when
the odds are so much greater that they will get killed by a blow to the head?

The fact that boxing is a brutal blood sport does not mean that boxers deserve
the added risk of being infected with a deadly virus spread through blood and
blood products, no matter how unlikely.

Common sense would say that if any sport should have an AIDS test, it's boxing.
If boxers were required to take a quick, inexpensive blood test before each
fight, what's the harm?

The people who fight the AIDS issue with politics and emotion see harm if the
public ever accepts AIDS testing for medical or peace-of-mind reasons. They are
concerned that testing will lead to discovery of HIV infections which will lead
to public discrimination. It's medical facts that identify carriers of a deadly
disease vs. the possibility that these victims will be victimized a second time
by public stigma and discrimination. Weigh that.

Discrimination against HIV carriers is unquestioned. Many have lost their jobs,
their health insurance and have been treated as pariahs.

By now everyone should know that AIDS is not a gay disease. If AIDS had been
introduced into this country by sexually active heterosexual college students,
rather than homosexuals and drug users, concerned parents and public officials
would have demanded that this new medical scourge by handled like all the other
sexually transmitted diseases, except with more vigor, fact-finding and
education.

The political component of the AIDS issue impedes fact-finding, heightens
paranoia, feeds homophobia and increases medical risks. The solution to
discrimination and homophobia should not come at the expense of sound medical
practice.

US COMPLAINS TOKYO'S UNTIED AID ENDS UP FAVORING JAPANESE FIRMS

BYLINE: RICHARD LAWRENCE; Journal of Commerce Staff

SECTION: FOREIGN TRADE, Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 672 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON


The Clinton administration is pressing for international rules to prevent Japan
from "unfairly" using its foreign-aid program to favor Japanese exporters over
U.S. and other suppliers.

Japan extends about $ 12 billion a year in "untied" aid to developing countries,
mainly in Asia. Untied aid nominally does not require recipient ountries to use
it to buy the aid donor's goods and services.

Japan's un tied aid has been steadily rising for years, and since an
international export-credit accord in 1992 it comprises nearly all of the
country's bilateral aid. The 1992 agreement, signed by Japan, the United States
and other industrial nations, limits tied aid, which requires a recipient
country to buy from the aid donor, but it is relatively silent on untied aid.

Japan is by far the biggest provider of untied aid. U.S. officials and business
executives, however, suspect that much of it is really tied.

"We view untied aid as the most urgent issue we face in ensuring that U.S.
exporters are able to compete on a level playing field" for aid-financed
projects around the world, said William Barreda, a deputy assistant treasury
secretary.

Untied aid, said U.S. Export-Import Bank Chairman Kenneth Brody, is "a very
sophisticated process." But, he recently told a Senate hearing, "we're now at a
point where we're ready to start . . . to deal with it."

Nobody can accurately say how much Japan's untied aid costs U.S. exporters in
lost business, but in past years, it has been estimated, losses attributable to
Japanese and European tied-aid practices were close to $ 2 billion annually.

Japan, the world's leading donor of bilateral aid, may be disguising tied aid as
untied in various ways, executives and government officials say. For one thing,
Japan finances far more project-feasibility studies in developing countries than
the United States does, giving Japanese suppliers an edge in winning those
projects.

Another device, they say, is the award of aid-financed contracts to companies
that are based in recipient nations but are actually Japanese joint ventures. In
1993, more than half of Japan's aid-financed contracts went to companies in
developing countries.

Failing to publish bids and setting very short bid periods are yet other
practices that officials say can turn untied aid into tied aid.

To try to keep untied aid untied, the Clinton administration is proposing to
Japan and other industrial nations that they adopt rules amending the 1992
export-credit accord, which was negotiated at the Paris-based Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development.

The United States, says Mr. Barreda, wants Japan and the other countries to give
adequate public notice of untied-aid tender requests, publish the requests in
English, set a reasonable period for the close of bids, announce the winning
bidders and tell why they won.

"Much more transparency in the operation of Japan's aid program" is needed, he
said.

But so far, said Mr. Brody, the Japanese are "resisting . . . very hard."

Meanwhile, the Commerce Department is heading an interagency effort to give U.S.
exporters advance information on Japanese aid-financed projects. It also could
give the government a clearer idea of the extent Japan's to which untied-aid
practices are shutting out U.S. suppliers.

That, however, is not enough for some U.S. exporters. Peggy Houlihan, president
of the Coalition for Employment Through Exports, a labor and management group,
argues that still more helpful would be a government effort to help U.S.
exporters get an early lead on aid-financed projects.

She said the State Department, in coordination with the Export-Import Bank, the
Trade and Development Agency and the Overseas Private Investment Corp., should
pinpoint early leads on capital projects at international aid-donor conferences
and pass the information along to U.S. firms.

Other governments, she said, are much more aggressive at those meetings in
staking out capital projects for their companies.

Suicide Indicates Problems;
With Isolating AIDS Patients

BYLINE: Chusei Mizumaki; Yomiuri Shimbun Staff Writer

SECTION: Pg. 3

LENGTH: 669 words


Another AIDS-infected patient has committed suicide, indicating that the
tendency in Japan to isolate people with the disease should perhaps be changed
to one that promotes coexistence.

A nurse at Komagome Hospital in Bunkyo-ku discovered a 32-year-old AIDS patient
on Nov. 11 who had hanged himself with a nightgown belt from a window. The
patient tested positive for the HIV virus in July 1991 and was hospitalized in
September.

In 1988, a hemophiliac killed himself in Hyogo-ken.

It is not known exactly why the Tokyo patient killed himself, because the
hospital is withholding information such as the name of the patient and the
treatment he received at the hospital.

Police said, however, that the man was upset about dealing with AIDS.

Komagome Hospital is one of the best staffed and equipped hospitals in Tokyo.
More than 200 people, including patients with AIDS symptoms who have been
transferred from smaller hospitals, and HIV carriers, have reportedly been
treated at this hospital.

The suicide must have sent shock waves through the hospital.

There were 497 confirmed AIDS patients and 2,369 HIV carriers in Japan as of the
end of August. To cope with the growing AIDS problem, the national and local
governments have begun AIDS awareness campaigns using television and posters.

The campaigns, however, have also raised public concern about AIDS and made
patients nervous. As a result, patients have become private and tended to stay
out of the public eye.

The patients have to deal with death, prejudice and discrimination by
themselves. For example, a Tokyo hotel in early September refused to take a
booking for a U.S. AIDS patient.

Medical institutions and public offices tend to isolate patients to protect
their privacy.

An HIV carrier in Tokyo with the pseudonym of Yutaka Hirata established a group
Oct. 28 that will discuss AIDS. "We are trying to create a society free from
prejudice against AIDS, where patients can live peacefully just like other
people," he said.

Hirata has called for a change in the treatment of AIDS patients. He wants AIDS
patients to be treated like ordinary people, not isolated, and he wants the
patients to change their attitude.

There is no effective cure for AIDS, but a new drug, DDC, which has been
authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, has proved effective in
slowing the progression of the AIDS virus, if it is used along with AZT.

This may indicate that AIDS is not a fatal disease, although it is difficult to
understand. In a sense, it can be compared with cancer and Alzheimer's disease.
Someday, medical science will probably find a cure for AIDS or at least find a
treatment that will prolong the life of patients with the disease.

It may be some time before the motive of the suicide at Komagome Hospital is
clarified. But we must realize that a society in which AIDS patients commit
suicide is not normal and that something is wrong with our society.

Americans panicked in the 1980s over AIDS, causing them to wage campaigns
against allowing children with AIDS to attend school and to establish hospices
for infected patients. But they have calmed down, thrown away their prejudices
against AIDS patients and have begun to promote AIDS education and have gone
ahead with plans to build AIDS hospices.

Three years ago, I visited an AIDS hospice in a residential area of Los Angeles.
Doctors, nurses, social workers and priests visited the hospice more than once a
week. They gave the patients advice on physical problems, anxiety and other
problems. Local volunteers also came to the hospice every day to look after the
patients.

One of the patients there said "I was anxious, but after moving here, I feel
calm because everybody is kind and treats me nicely."

Is it possible to nurture a society in which AIDS patients coexist, as well as
share their apprehension and fear, with ordinary people? The 32-year-old man's
suicide is forcing us to question whether we can achieve this goal.

Candidates' stands on AIDS

BYLINE: Bob Minzesheimer

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 3A

LENGTH: 385 words

DATELINE: PRESIDENT BUSH


Says ''we are going to whip that disease,'' and ''we've been spending at the
rate of about $ 4.3 billion for AIDS. That's about 10 times as much as on, say,
cancer, per case.'' But the National Commission on AIDS, appointed jointly by
the president and Congress, says Bush's spending comparison is ''misleading and
erroneous'' because it includes money AIDS patients receive in Social Security
and Medicaid benefits.

- In 1990, signed the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Act, to help communities
disproportionately affected by epidemic.

- Says he has pushed regulatory changes that accelerated approval of
experimental drugs, including AZT.

- The National Commission ''reluctantly concluded'' in June that the Bush
administration ''is not prepared to undertake any significant new actions
against the HIV/ AIDS epidemic, and that current efforts fall tragically short
of what is needed.''

BILL CLINTON

- Vows to appoint an ''AIDS czar'' and a White House task force to implement the
AIDS commission recommendations, including full funding of the Ryan White Act ($
880 million) and Medicaid coverage for all low-income people with the HIV virus
(extra cost unspecified).

- Says ''I've got friends who have died of AIDS'' and notes that since 1990,
AIDS education is required in Arkansas schools, and spending on HIV counseling
and voluntary testing increased by 40%.

- The San Francisco Examiner reported in April that in Arkansas ''AIDS policies
get little attention from Clinton and his state legislature and even fewer
dollars.'' It said the state's ''rural, conservative legislature may be largely
to blame,'' but Clinton ''can be faulted for failing to provide leadership.''

- Unlike many states, Arkansas allows doctors to test people for HIV without
their consent and requires that names of HIV-infected people be turned over to
state officials - which AIDS activists say frightens people away from tests.

ROSS PEROT

- Has written that the need to control health and insurance costs has been
''given a new and terrible urgency by the deadly AIDS epidemic that has already
taken such a tragic toll. This plague must be attacked at every level:
education, prevention and accelerated research.'' But he has not spelled out how
he would do that or how much money it would cost.

AID POLITICS ON POLICY AGENDA AS JAPAN BECOMES TOP DONOR;
JAPAN

BYLINE: PETER OSBORNE

SECTION: SPECIAL SUPPLEMENT; Pg. 32

LENGTH: 1943 words


JAPAN has overtaken the US as the world's largest net donor of official foreign
aid, propelling aid politics on to Tokyo's foreign policy agenda as a focal
point of its relationship with developing countries as well as its quest for
greater regional and global policy leadership.

But although Japan is making an enormous contribution to international
development assistance, a fierce debate has ensued on how best to expand and
improve Japan's aid performance.

Last year Japan's net ODA disbursement was $US8.958 billion, 0.32 per cent of
GNP, which was an increase of 4 per cent in real terms over the previous year,
but down in US dollar terms because of the devaluation of the yen.

In July, Japan, which has moved from the second-largest World Bank loan debtor
to the world's biggest creditor nation, finally repaid its last World Bank loan.

This is a remarkable development for a nation whose first technical assistance
programme 35 years ago was a mere $US50,000 and 12 years ago Japan disbursed
less than $US2 billion in annual aid.

Japan is now the second largest contributor, after the US, to the World Bank,
bearing 6.69 per cent of its total shares. The bank also borrows up to one third
of its finances from the Tokyo money market.

Although grudgingly, the world is coming to accept Japan's status as the largest
net creditor nation in the world and dominant private banker, the leaders in the
Gaimusho, Japan's Foreign Ministry in Tokyo, have turned their attention to poor
nations to expand their nation's international influence in trade and investment
and to divert some of Japan's gigantic surpluses into real economic influence,
particularly in the Asia region.

In 1988 Japan's net disbursement of ODA totalled $US9.134 billion, its share of
total disbursement by the OECD's Development Assistance Committee(DAC) was 19
per cent, and Japan ranked as DAC's second largest donor after the US.

In 1988, Japan's ODA was 0.32 per cent of GNP, ranking 12th within DAC's
18-member body, an improvement from its 1974 level of 0.25 per cent.

But Japan's overall grant element in 1987 was only 75.4 per cent, compared to
the DAC average of 90.2 per cent (including Australia at 100 per cent and the US
at 97.2 per cent), making Japan the lowest in the DAC.

Japan has subsequently tended to meet criticism of its aid programme through
quantitative improvement, such as aid-doubling targets rather than improving aid
quality.

There have been calls from international aid agencies like the DAC to increase
levels of aid. The chairman of the DAC, Mr Joseph Wheeler, has called on Japan
to increase its aid to 0.35 per cent of GNP before 1992 and continue efforts to
raise the ratio of monetary grants in aid or donations.

With the surge in the quantity of Japan's overseas aid has come a concurrent
problem: how to administer that aid so that it has the maximum desired effect.

Most international aid experts agree the quality of Japanese aid is low. Loans
are given on tough terms, with more aid to developing countries than most other
donors and there is a concentration on large, capital-intensive projects which
often don't benefit those on subsistence levels.

JAPAN'S aid programme compares unfavourably with those of Australia, the US and
other donor nations, according to a report released earlier this year by Tokyo's
Economic Planning Agency (EPA).

The EPA argues that Japan should improve both the quality and quantity of its
aid to developing nations.

"Japan should increase the number of grants it gives to developing countries as
a proportion of overall official aid," the report said.

In 1988 grants made up 46.6 per cent of Japan's total official development
assistance, compared with an average 78.4 per cent among 18 other donor nations
in the same period.

The report also urged Japan to increase technological aid, which made up only 12
per cent of Japan's total development aid in 1988, against an average of 21.3
per cent among other donor nations.

The report also recommended that Japan should focus more on technology transfers
and recommended sending more engineering consultants abroad and inviting foreign
engineers and students to Japan for training.

A primary target of Japanese foreign aid projects, tied to humanitarian
objectives, is to build up economic infrastructures in Asian nations. Almost 60
per cent of all the electric power generated in Malaysia and 25 per cent of
Java's electricity generation has been developed with Japanese aid.

But this concentration on infrastructure projects, such as irrigation systems,
port facilities and power generation, has led to criticism by the EPA which
argues for greater foreign economic assistance in technology transfer,
engineering, economic

management and other fields not directly related to the supply of equipment and
road building.

Tokyo is the largest international donor for capital projects such as dams and
power stations, spending about 37 per cent of total aid on infrastructure

Japan is now in the middle of a five-year plan to boost aid to more than$63.28
billion in 1988-92 from $31.51 billion in 1983-87.

But Tokyo, for the first time, seems to be preparing to discriminate politically
in the way it allocates aid funds.

In a White Paper on official development assistance (ODA) released this month,
Japan's Foreign Ministry said it might withhold aid from countries with
excessive amounts of military spending or which follow economic development
models not favoured by Japan.

Analysts see this as a response to last year's crackdown by the Chinese and
Burmese Governments on rising pro-democracy movements and the changes towards
democratisation in Eastern Europe and increasing pressure from on Japan from the
US and EC to

increase aid to this region.

Of the $US8.9 billion of ODA disbursed by Japan in the fiscal year ended on
March 31, Asia received 62.5 per cent.

But aid to Asia could actually rise in the future. Five Asian countries -India,
Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and the Philippines - are candidates for
increased aid from Japan because they are likely to be the hardest hit by the
effects of the Gulf crisis.

By emphasising the sort of democratic priorities championed by other major
industrial powers, Tokyo may be seeking to deflect criticisms from the US and
the EC that its ODA tends to be on hard terms compared with that of other
countries and that it is tied too often to the procurement of Japanese goods.

Grants, for example, accounted for only 43 per cent of Japanese ODA last year, a
considerably lower proportion than for other major aid donors.

The Japanese are gradually untying loans, but in practice, directly or
indirectly, between 60 and 70 per cent of all Japanese aid-related contracts are
won by Japanese companies.

Japan used to rely on tied aid as the main link between aid and trade spin-offs,
and this is still reflected in the grants programme.

It also uses what are called Overseas Economic Co-operation Fund (OECF)"general
projects", where concessional funds are given to assist private companies'
projects overseas.

In July last year, the then Japanese Prime Minister, Mr Uno, announced a$US43
billion package to spur economic growth in developing nations.

Key elements of the package include a $US35 billion expansion of Japan's
programme to recycle its vast trade surpluses, mostly in the form of untied
grants.

This funding would come on top of a three-year, $US30 billion programme
announced in 1987.

The Japanese Government also announced a three year $US2.25 billion aid
programme for environmental needs.

Although Japan has become the world's largest donor of foreign aid, with
promises of assistance totalling more than $US50 billion in the five-year period
ending 1992, critics like the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development have said Japanese aid projects should be more cost-effective and
should avoid disrupting local communities and the environment.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs claims that about 80 per cent of Japan's OECF
loans are completely untied, and that less than 30 per cent of those untied OECF
loans are procured by Japanese firms.

But many aid analysts contend that ODA aid has been too concentrated on"tied"
loans, that is loans released on condition that Japanese firms be given
preference in project bidding, and that there should be a greater mix between
loans on easier repayment terms and outright grants.

The Ministry of International Trade and Industry says the reduction of the rate
of interest charged on concessional yen loans is the highest priority for
improving the quality of Japan's aid.

The professor of Japanese Studies at the University of Queensland, Alan Rix,
said the greatest relevance to current policy trends was the underlying
philosophy of Japan's aid.

He said: "There has always been a tension between trade and political objectives
in Japan's programme.

"Thus the Japanese use the term 'economic co-operation' to describe their total
effort to assist developing countries.

"The difference between ODA and non-official flows has not always been made
clear in Japanese programs, although the term 'aid' is now generally used only
to refer to the ODA component of total flows.

"Part of the problem of inconsistent objectives has stemmed from the fact that
there has never been one dominant aid authority within Japan, and conflicting
perceptions of aid encouraged confused bureaucratic structures each responsible
for separate elements of the aid program."

The need for a better co-ordinated approach to aid assistance is also considered
a priority by Japanese aid policy-makers.

Its loan policy is effectively decided by the three most important aid
ministries - trade and industry, finance and foreign affairs.

Although the Foreign Ministry will set the terms and conditions of the loan,
they are reviewed by the other departments, making the approval of aid projects
a cumbersome process.

The EPA also recommends greater joint co-operation between Japan's development-
aid organisations and developing countries.

Australia and Japan, for example, appear to be nearing a co-ordinated approach
to development aid to the South Pacific following joint initiatives with the
Australian International Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB).

The Japanese spend $160 million, about 1.4 per cent of their total aid
programme, in the south-west Pacific and Australia spends another $80 million in
the region.

At the recent annual Australia-Japan aid consultations it was agreed by both
Governments to send a joint study mission to the Pacific to investigate
possibilities for future joint aid activities in consultation with recipient
governments.

The mission will take place next July and will visit Papua-New Guinea and Fiji.

ALREADY there has been co-operation on airport infrastructure projects in
Vanuatu, Western Samoa and Tonga, with Japan constructing terminal buildings and
Australia building the runways.

But the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tokyo now appears likely to take that
co-operation a step further to identify further appropriate joint aid ventures.
The co-operation could extend to Australian technical consultants being allowed
to work on Japan-funded projects.

In terms of the geographic distribution of Japanese aid, more than 60 per cent
is disbursed in Asia.

But the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has indicated that as Asian nations mature
economically, Japan will shift more attention to Africa, the Indian
sub-continent and Latin America.

To improve disbursement levels, the Ministry of Finance proposes to recycle$US30
billion of the current-account surplus in the three years ending 1995, mostly
through multilateral agencies like the World Bank, and through co-financing
arrangements.

Activists: $ 882M in AIDS help falls short

BYLINE: Carol Memmott

SECTION: NEWS

LENGTH: 302 words


The AIDS resources bill signed by President Bush over the weekend authorizes $
882 million in emergency help to cities struggling with the AIDS epidemic. But
AIDS activists it's too little, too late.

''Where was it five years ago,'' says AIDS patient Steve Walton, 43, of San
Francisco. Walton wants more access to new drugs for AIDS patients. ''Come on,
let's get going,'' says Walton. ''We're dying.''

Belinda Mason, of Utica, Ky., also infected with the AIDS virus, says the bill
provides ''desperately needed disaster relief, but funding isn't enough. It's
like putting a band-aid on a large, cancerous growth.'' Mason is on the National
Commission on AIDS.

The Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency Act is named for the
Indiana teen-ager who died from AIDS in April. It is the first law to provide
health grants to states and localities to fight a specific disease.

Congress still has to pass a separate appropriations bill.

''It's probably a life or death reprieve for some big city hospitals,'' says Dr.
June Osborn, head of the The National Commission on AIDS.

What cities are facing:

- Ward 86, the outpatient AIDS clinic at San Francisco General Hospital, handles
1,500 appointments a month, up from 300 in 1983.

- The share of New York City hospital beds used by AIDS patients - 8% - could
double by 1992.

To qualify, a city has to have at least 2,000 AIDS cases to date or a rate of 25
per 10,000 residents.

Communities across the USA are struggling to keep up with the cost of treating
victims, says physician Ken McIntosh, who treats Boston children with AIDS.

AIDS is spread through the exchange of blood or body fluids or contaminated
needles. It has killed more than 83,000 in the USA since 1980. An estimated 1.5
million Americans are believed to be carriers.

EAST ST. LOUIS STUDENTS ARE QUIZZED ON AIDS

BYLINE: Robert Goodrich Of the Post-Dispatch Staff

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 1I

LENGTH: 1040 words


Students at East St. Louis Senior High School scored well on a quiz about AIDS,
but they still have some misconceptions, Dr. Bernard J. Turnock, Illinois public
health director, said Wednesday.  Turnock told the students that more AIDS
(acquired immune deficiency syndrome) cases have turned up in the Metro East
area than anywhere in the state except Chicago.  Thirty percent of AIDS victims
in Illinois are black, he added, and the disease is spreading slightly faster
among blacks and Hispanics than among whites.  Blacks may be more likely to get
AIDS because intravenous drug use is more frequent in black municipalities,
Turnock said.  Results of a quiz given to about 400 students at the school
showed almost all knew the most common ways AIDS is spread: having unprotected
sex or sharing a needle that a person with AIDS had just used to inject drugs.
But the quiz also showed that: Slightly more than half of the students believed
AIDS could be transmitted by blood-sucking insects such as mosquitoes.  Half
believed a person could get AIDS from giving blood.  Almost one-third believed a
person could get AIDS from drinking from a glass just used by a person with
AIDS.  One-fourth believed a person could get AIDS from using a public toilet
seat.  All of those beliefs are false.  At the school assembly where Turnock
spoke, a student asked whether one could get AIDS from kissing.  ''Probably
not,'' he replied. ''But with kissing, one thing can lead to another.'' Gary
Monachino, the department's AIDS education coordinator, answered the question
more bluntly: ''To not have sex is the best way to protect yourself against the
AIDS virus,'' he said. ''Or use a condom every time.'' Monachino added, ''You
don't get it. You have to take AIDS. It's not like a cold. It's not like the
flu. Whether or not you catch AIDS - whether or not you take it - is really up
to you.'' Turnock and Monachino warned that sharing a needle to inject steroids
could be as risky as sharing one for other drugs.  Students are generally the
best informed and most teachable segment of the population, and they may have to
shoulder the burden of teaching younger brothers and sisters or even adult
relatives how to prevent AIDS, Turnock and Monachino said.  Monachino emphasized
that prevention was the key because no cure exists.  ''If you get infected,
there's nothing that science or medicine currently can do.'' Turnock held a
press conference for students in the high school's journalism program. He
expressed doubt that an AIDS cure would be found within 10 years. ''We can't
wait for that,'' he said.  Medical science has had little success curing
viruses; fortunately most - unlike the AIDS virus - are not fatal, he said.  One
student reporter asked what type of condom was most effective in preventing
AIDS. Turnock recommended those made of latex. Cheaper types are less reliable,
he said.  ''Schools have been given a 'bum rap' when it comes to AIDS
education,'' Turnock said. News reports generally have emphasized controversy
over whether students with AIDS should be admitted, rather than what schools are
doing to prevent AIDS, he said.  Turnock said the good news about AIDS was, ''We
know enough about it to absolutely control it.'' But that knowledge does not
ensure success, he warned. He noted that 25 years of publicity about the health
damage caused by cigarette smoking had reduced the percentage of adults in the
United States who smoke only to about 30 percent from 50 percent.  Fear,
hysteria, paranoia and prejudice interfere with AIDS education by causing people
to seek scapegoats or ignore dangers rather than reacting intelligently, Turnock
said.  ''Too much attention has been focused on what is remotely, possibly
conceivable,'' rather than using what is known about AIDS prevention, he said.
AIDS affects everyone because of medical costs, increases in insurance rates,
work loss and early deaths, Turnock said.  ''You have already been touched by
this disease. If you don't know someone with the disease today, you will
tomorrow.''

AIDS AND THE BATTLE AGAINST IGNORANCE

SOURCE: QNP

BYLINE: THURLOW C

LENGTH: 1465 words


page 3 As debate continues in Queensland over AIDS education and morals, BLITZ
examines the disease and how it relates to the young and inexperienced. While
the community wrestles with its collective emotions, AIDS is spreading and could
well be killing people through ignorance. AIDS, Acquired Immune Deficiency
Syndrome, is a disease caused by a virus which attacks and breaks down the
body's immune system. No one can tell if a person has the virus without a
special blood test. No one can tell by the way a person looks or dresses or
talks. That's why AIDS is spreading. If a person is sexually active or uses a
needle or syringe to administer intravenous drugs, that person is at risk. There
is no cure for AIDS. But not everyone who gets the virus dies. Some people who
have the virus will never get sick, but will simply act as its carrier. Others
will develop what is called AIDS Related Complex (ARC). This means they will
develop some illnesses for the remainder of their lives. Other people will get
what is called ""full-blown", Category A AIDS and will die, usually within two
to five years. People who die from full AIDS are not killed by the AIDS virus
itself. They die from other diseases which get through their body's immune
defence system: diseases which would not affect them if they did not have the
AIDS virus. Education Officer at the Family Planning Association of Australia,
Mr Peter van der Duys, said young people lacked knowledge on the disease which
might explain to them who was at risk. ""Most teenagers have the attitude that
it won't happen to them or that it's only a gay disease," said Mr van der Duys.
""Anyone who has sexual contact is at risk," he said. The State Education
Department, in conjunction with the Health Department, will introduce an AIDS
education program into State secondary schools to draw the attention of young
people to the danger of contracting AIDS and the nature and significance of the
problem. The Health Minister, Mr Ahern and the Education Minister, Mr Powell,
have disagreed several times over which department had more say in the program.
The Ministers have constantly disagreed on how much information should be given
on AIDS. Mr Powell has told teachers in State schools not to discuss condoms
with their students. The Queensland Catholic Education Office backed the
decision to ban talk of condoms in schools. An office spokesman, Father Ron
McKiernan, said the Catholic Church rejected any form of education that ""failed
to promote moral responsibility and chastity as the true and best remedy." Mr
Ahern said he could not see how anti-AIDS measures could be taught without
reference to sexual intercourse or the use of condoms as protection against the
disease. Mr Powell said students only needed to learn that AIDS was transmitted
by body fluids or dirty syringes. A student who asked about sexual intercourse
should be referred to a doctor or a health expert. The Education Department will
introduce two programs aimed at giving students an understanding of the AIDS
virus, how it is transmitted and its effects upon individuals, families and
society. The first is curriculum-based and will be included in school studies
for grades eight to 12. The Health Department Assistant Director-General
(Schools), Dr Ken Robertson, said a personal development program for both
parents and students would also be implemented. This would include trained
lecturers working with parents and young people. Questions relating to
preventative measures such as the use of condoms and safe sex were not listed in
the guideline topics released by the Education Department. The Health Department
will introduce an AIDS education program for Year 12 students at State secondary
schools on October 5. Doctors will give in-class lectures and a video will be
shown telling how AIDS can be transmitted by vaginal or anal intercourse and by
contaminated syringes. Condoms will be mentioned in the video. The Queensland
AIDS Council education officer, Ms Jill Rhodes says teenagers should be taught
about AIDS when they are becoming sexually active. ""It's important to get the
message across at this age because they're just starting to experiment with
their sexuality, which can be the most dangerous time if they don't know the
facts about AIDS. ""We attempt to promote safe sex by giving a total view of
sexuality," Ms Rhodes said. A Brisbane practitioner who has organised a number
of free AIDS seminars, said his experiences showed there were glaring gaps in
sex education in the community _ especially about AIDS. The doctor said many
young children had been taught very little about sex education and hygiene, as
their parents did not know much either. Latest figures released by the Health
Department indicate 438 AIDS-infected cases in Queensland have been detected
since 1984. This includeD 58 people who had contracted the deadly Category A _
40 of whom have died. Of the 438 there were: 270 homosexual, 58 bisexual, 31
drug users, six hetrosexual, one maternal (a baby born with AIDS) and 24
unclassified had AIDS. The remainder were haemophilia cases and people who had
contracted AIDS through blood transfusions which they received before 1984.
Blood screening was introduced in that year, and since then, no one has
contracted AIDS through blood transfusions. At first many people thought AIDS
was a homosexual or bisexual disease. This is not true. Anyone can get AIDS.
AIDS is caused by a virus, offically called the human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV). Most experts believe HIV originated in central Africa, probably in the
Congo River basin, in what is now Zaire. It is suggested the virus originally
infected monkeys, then mutated into a form which could infect humans. HOW IS
AIDS SPREAD? Sexually (via heterosexual or homosexual intercourse). Through
contaminated blood (via needle-sharing during drug use, or through blood
transfusions or blood products). In the womb at birth. WHO IS AT RISK? Anyone
who engages in sexual practices which are known to transmit HIV. These are:
unprotected anal intercourse, unprotected vaginal intercourse, and any practice
which involves blood-to-blood contact. Such practices include: Anyone who shares
needles while using intravenous drugs. Receiving blood transfusions with AIDS-
infected blood. People from countries in which AIDS is endemic. Unborn and
newborn children of AIDS-infected women. It is important to note that people
coming into everyday contact with AIDS patients will not catch the virus
themselves. These situations would cover: family members of infected people,
other than sexual partners; health care workers caring for people with AIDS or
other HIV-infected people; and anyone who lives, works, receives services from
or shares facilities with an infected person. People can't catch AIDS from:
mosquito bites, toilet seats, hugs and kisses, money, saliva, drinking from the
same glass, coughs or sneezes, handshakes, swimming pools or giving blood. HIGH
RISK ACTIVITIES: Unsafe sex _ sexual intercourse is unsafe if semen, blood or
vaginal fluids pass from an infected person to a sex partner. Normally one or
more of these body fluids are exchanged between two people who have sex
together. The only way to help prevent the exchange of fluids during sex is to
use a condom. Sharing needles or syringes _ when someone uses a needle or
syringe to inject drugs, small particles of blood are left behind in the needle.
If this blood contains the AIDS virus, then the next person to use that needle
will inject himself or herself with infected blood. This is also true if anyone
shares needles for tattooing or ear piercing. If needles are not properly
sterilised, the virus can be passed around. STAY SAFE FROM AIDS: Intravenous
drug users should never share needles or syringes. For anyone unfortunate enough
to be using heroin _ how about giving it away altogether? Anyone who has been
sexually active in the past five years could not say for sure they are
unaffected by AIDS. The only way to be sure is to have a blood test. Decisons
about sexual behaviour will effect the chances of contracting AIDS. The choices
are: CELIBACY _ the decision not to have sex at all. MONOGAMY _ the decision to
not have sex with anyone except the person someone wants to marry or live with
for a long time, who is not an AIDS carrier. ALWAYS USE A CONDOM _ someone could
decide to have sex with more than one person during their life, but only to have
safe sex. That means always using a condom, although condoms are far from 100
percent effective. They can rip or come away. RISK CATCHING AIDS _ someone could
decide to have sex with more than one person and not to worry about safe sex.
This means that every time they have sex, they are at risk of catching AIDS.

AIDS creates a new market // Companies pursue profit as well as cure,
preventionof disease

BYLINE: HELEN HUNTLEY

SECTION: BUSINESS; Pg. 1I

LENGTH: 2385 words



AIDS is a deadly, tragic and so-far incurable disease, but for many    companies
it's also a great business opportunity. Some already are    profiting from the
growing public interest in AIDS, while others are    racing to discover the AIDS
treatment, vaccine or test that will be    their key to riches.

     It may be years before the real winners emerge, but stock market
investors already are placing their bets.

     Stock prices soared in February and March for drug and    biotechnology
companies involved in AIDS research, for private blood    banks and even for
condom manufacturers. Although prices since have    dropped along with the rest
of the stock market, more action may be to    come.

     "It was absolute hysteria," said Stephen Kay, portfolio manager    for
Fidelity Select Biotechnology Fund, a specialized mutual fund which    is up
about 35 percent in value so far this year.

     AIDS could generate several billion dollars a year in business for
companies that develop successful drug treatments, vaccines and    screening
tests, said Eric Rosenbaum, a senior health industry    consultant for Arthur D.
Little, a Boston-based consulting firm.

     If that happens, he said, businesses won't be the only    beneficiaries.

     "From a societal standpoint, it's enormously cost effective to try    and
develop those kinds of drugs," he said. "If they could prevent    the spread of
disease, $ 3-billion would be a drop in the bucket    compared to the cost of
dealing with AIDS for hundreds of thousands of    people."

     The potential market for AIDS-related business appears to be very    large
indeed. Unheard of a decade ago, Acquired Immune Deficiency    Syndrome, or
AIDS, already has claimed more than 18,000 lives in the    U.S. About 32,000
cases have been reported in the country, a number    which is expected to reach
270,000 by 1991. The Centers for Disease    Control estimates that as many as
1.5-million Americans now may be    carrying the AIDS virus.

     However, the potential AIDS market is not limited to those who have    the
virus. It includes everyone who wants to avoid AIDS or who wants to    find out
who's been infected with the virus or who hasn't.

     AIDS testing is now approaching a $ 100-million-a-year business,    which
many people see as just the beginning.

     The nation's blood banks, which need to keep their blood supplies    safe,
are now the biggest buyers of AIDS tests. Some insurance    companies also have
begun requiring the test of applicants in an    attempt to avoid getting hit
with big claims from AIDS patients.

     Although proposals for mass screening have generated considerable
opposition, it is possible that tests might one day be required to get    a
marriage license, enter a hospital or get certain types of jobs.

     Since the disease has no cure, there currently is little incentive    for
individuals voluntarily to go for testing. In fact, there's a    disincentive
because once they've been identified, many carriers of the    AIDS virus have
faced discrimination. If a cure should be discovered,    however, demand for
testing could explode.

     At the moment, Abbott Laboratories is the leader in AIDS testing,    but
the competition to develop faster and more reliable tests is    fierce.

     The simple screening test now in wide use detects the presence of    AIDS
antibodies in the blood, not the AIDS virus itself. One of its big    drawbacks
is that the test often gives false positive readings. A    positive test must be
followed up by a more elaborate test, known as    the Western Blot, that has a
waiting period of several days for    results.

     A St. Petersburg firm, Life Sciences, is working on a Quick Western    Blot
test that would provide results in about an hour and could be in    experimental
use by the end of the summer.

     "We see a unique service opportunity and a very high value    product,"
said Alex Burns, director of corporate development for Life    Sciences, which
now produces natural Alpha Interferon, an experimental    drug for cancer
patients.

     The company's longer-term objective is to develop an AIDS test    people
could do in their own homes, Burns said.

     Other companies, including Abbott, are working on tests that detect    the
AIDS virus itself, not just the antibodies.

     The really big breakthrough would be the development of a test that
could predict not just who's been infected with the virus, but whether    and
when an infected person would become sick, Rosenbaum said.

     Other companies involved in AIDS testing research include    Miami-based
North American Biologicals, Cambridge BioScience Inc.,    Cetus Corp., DuPont
Co., Syntex Corp., Genentech Inc., Chiron Corp. and    American Bionetics Inc.
        The laboratory contest isn't limited to the development of new    tests.

 Several companies, including Chiron, Genentech, Repligen Corp.    and Oncogene
Science Inc., have their scientists working on an AIDS    vaccine, which could
be the long-term solution to the AIDS problem.

     "If a reasonably effective vaccine becomes available, that alone    could
be a billion-dollar product," Rosenbaum said.

     However, the development process is proving to be very difficult,    in
part because there are many strains of the AIDS virus and in part    because the
virus attacks the body in different ways.

     Development of an AIDS vaccine "is a real long shot," said Kay at
Fidelity Select. "That's really going to the craps table."

     Research is farther along on drugs to treat AIDS patients.

 Burroughs Wellcome Co. last month became the first and only company to    bring
an AIDS drug to market in the U.S. The company is a subsidiary of
British-based Wellcome Foundation Ltd., which is traded on the London
Exchange under the name Wellcome plc.

     The AIDS drug, Retrovir, also known as AZT or azidothymidine, has
generated controversy because of its very high price tag - an estimated    $
7,000 to $ 10,000 a year per patient. The wholesale price of one bottle    of
100 capsules is $ 188.

     In Florida alone, the Department of Health and Rehabilitative    Services
estimates that it will cost the state $ 1.37-million in the    next year and as
much as $ 23-million a year by 1991 to provide Retrovir    to AIDS patients on
Medicaid. Gov. Bob Martinez last week endorsed a    plan for the state to pay
those bills.

     The company has been attacked as greedy by homosexual activists and
congressmen. However, Burroughs Wellcome has plenty of supporters. Last
Monday the Wall Street Journal devoted half its editorial page to a    defense
of the company.

     Burroughs Wellcome spokesman Kathy Bartlett said Retrovir was    expensive
to develop and is costly to make.

     "It is very difficult, time-consuming and expensive to make," she    said.
"It takes seven months from start to finish to make it and it    requires at
least 23 separate chemical reactions. Gearing up the    production from small
laboratory amounts to enough to meet the needs of    thousands of patients has
been a significant undertaking."

     Retrovir has been shown to prolong the lives of AIDS patients, but
            it also has been found to have serious side effects for some.
Bartlett    said the company can't begin to predict the future market for the
drug.

     "There's a great deal more research to be done," she said. "We    don't
know the full spectrum of patients for whom it might be    appropriate or the
effects of using it for long periods of time."

     There's also the possibility that another company might come up    with a
better drug. Hoffmann-La Roche, Genetics Institute, Genentech,    Biogen and
Schering-Plough are among the companies that have been    working on drugs to
treat AIDS.

     "There are probably 20 companies with AIDS drugs" under research,    Kay
said. He said investors should be careful about buying stock in a    company
before its AIDS drug has been fully tested.

     "The best way to play any of these is to own a diversified package    of
stocks," he said.

     Kay said AIDS also will be a boon to home health care companies and    to
manufacturers of disposable needles, syringes and blood-collection    bags.

     Many other types of businesses also are using an AIDS-prevention    sales
pitch to promote their products.

     Among the most successful have been the condom manufacturers, who    have
watched sales grow along with public awareness that AIDS is    transmitted
through sexual contact. Even U.S. Surgeon General Everett    Koop has endorsed
condoms as way to prevent the spread of AIDS.

     Kay casts his vote for Carter-Wallace, the leader in the condom    field.
Raymond James & Associates broker Harvey Hertz said he has been    recommending
another condom company, Mentor Corp., as the best    AIDS-related investment for
his clients.

     "I think this is an opportunity," Hertz said. "Mentor is the    niche
company. It's a lot smaller and any kind of decent percentage    increase in the
sale of condoms would impact earnings quite    considerably. They also do a lot
more than manufacture condoms."

     Private blood banks also have gotten into the AIDS-prevention    business,
offering customers a way to store their own blood for future    use, avoiding
the possibility of contracting AIDS through a blood    transfusion.

     It should be noted, however, that the risk of contracting AIDS    through a
transfusion is believed to be very small now that AIDS    screening tests have
been developed.

     New York-based Daxor Corp., which runs a frozen sperm bank, has    signed
contracts with Warner Communications Inc. and IMS International    Inc. to
provide blood storage as an employee benefit.

     However, the price is quite high - $ 150 a year per unit for red    blood
cells plus a $ 45 per unit processing fee - and demand for blood    storage is
uncertain.

     "We just don't feel there's a big demand for it," said Kevin    Lindberg,
director of community resources for the non-profit Community    Blood Bank in
St. Petersburg, which also offers similar blood storage    services at lower
prices.

     The Quixote Corp. of Chicago is taking a different approach -    working on
the development of artificial blood.

     Many small companies have joined the rush to provide AIDS-related
services. In Philadelphia, there's ICOA Inc., which earlier this month
launched an AIDS Information Clearinghouse, a computerized
information-retrieval service. In Fort Lauderdale, there's a private    company,
Doctor's House Calls, that does in-home AIDS screening. Some    dating services
even have made AIDS testing a requirement for their    clients.

     One thing seems certain: AIDS is likely to be a very big business    for a
long time to come.

Many Prostitutes Found to Be AIDS Carriers

BYLINE: By Margaret Engel, Washington Post Staff Writer

SECTION: First Section; A1

LENGTH: 863 words


The federal government yesterday revealed research showing that many female
prostitutes are carriers of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, and it warned
men to avoid prostitutes if they want to protect themselves from the AIDS virus.

In the newest and most definitive results to date of AIDS surveys among
prostitutes, a Centers for Disease Control report to be issued today shows that
five of 92 prostitutes tested in Seattle and 10 of 25 prostitutes who came
forward for tests in Miami were carrying the AIDS virus. The presence of the
disease was detected through blood tests.

The levels among prostitutes are far above the rates at which others in society
are infected with the AIDS virus. Based on CDC estimates, one in 300 or 400
Americans might show signs of infection with the AIDS virus.

Government health officials at a news conference yesterday emphasized repeatedly
that AIDS is not passed by casual contact, that it is a sexually transmitted
disease and therefore can be avoided by curbing certain sex practices.

Also released were new figures showing that 133 heterosexual women and men are
now classified as having AIDS. This represents about 1 percent of the 13,061
adult AIDS cases.

Although that proportion has remained constant since heterosexual cases were
first counted in 1984, the number of cases has grown as the AIDS epidemic has
worsened.

The new cases are nearly triple the number of a year ago, when there were 45
heterosexuals with AIDS.

Another 6 percent, about 780 of current AIDS cases, do not fit any risk group
and may include more cases of heterosexual transmission of the disease.

"We never felt this disease was a homosexual or gay disease," said Dr. Anthony
Fauci, the National Institutes of Health's chief AIDS researcher. He emphasized
that sexual intercourse is the main way AIDS is transmitted and that certain
sexual practices of some homosexuals prompted a greater number of cases among
that population.

But, in another new result offered yesterday, officials confirmed that three
health workers were found to have positive blood tests, even though they are not
in any AIDS risk group. They apparently were infected by needles used in lab
work. One worker is from Boston and another is from New York, according to
Public Health Service spokeswoman Shellie Lengel.

Lengel said a paper is being readied for publication next week on the cases, but
no other information is available. Another 15 health workers found to be
positive do belong to some risk group, according to federal reports.

Officials urged all those handling needles, such as health care workers and
embalmers, to observe federal precautions, issued in 1983, on handling needles
and fluids contaminated with AIDS.

Federal health directors attempted to calm worries about heterosexual
transmission by saying that if the public followed safe sex guidelines, "this
could stop transmission of this disease today," according to Dr. James Mason,
acting assistant secretary of health.

"This disease is controllable now," Mason said, adding that recent declines in
cases of syphilis and gonorrhea show the public is modifying its sexual behavior
because of fear of contracting AIDS.

The government yesterday issued the following guidelines on reducing the risk of
contracting AIDS:

*Sex with members of AIDS risk groups or with people who have sex with
risk-group members should be avoided.

*Condoms should be used if such sexual encounters occur, the health officials
said.

*The injection of illicit drugs should be avoided. Needles should not be shared.

*Women who abuse drugs, have a partner in a high-risk group or whose blood is
positive for the AIDS virus should avoid pregnancy, the guidelines state.

If they become pregnant, they should not breastfeed their babies, federal
doctors said yesterday.

Although not part of the guidelines, the doctors said the recent case of an
Australian infant who developed AIDS through his mother's milk should discourage
breastfeeding by women whose blood is shown to be positive for the AIDS virus.

The doctors played down the risk of contracting AIDS from saliva and tears,
noting that the AIDS virus only occasionally appeared in these body fluids of
AIDS patients. Dowdle added, "You might find virus in the saliva of one out of
50 people with AIDS."

This information should lessen the public's fear about contracting AIDS through
casual kissing or being sneezed or coughed on by people with AIDS, the doctors
said.

"It takes the most intimate kind of body exchange to get it," said Mason. "If
you look at the data that has accumulated with families, clearly hugging,
kissing and other forms of affection exclusive of sexual contact" does not
result in a risk of AIDS.

The doctors said they did not fault parents for keeping children home rather
than sending them to a school attended by children with AIDS, yet they noted the
risk from a "normal" child with AIDS was minimal.

"Parents want a 100 percent guarantee and we can't give it to them," said Fauci.
"But we've bent over backwards on our guidelines to be conservative. People need
to understand this is a sexually transmitted disease."

Parliament: Voluntary aid praised: state aid defended / Conflict between Labour
leader Kinnock and Premier Thatcher over famine relief budget

SECTION: Issue 62192.

LENGTH: 749 words


Mrs Margaret Thatcher, the Prime Minister, gave an indication during Commons
questioning that the RAF Hercules airlift of food and other emergency aid in
Ethiopia may be extended. It was due to cease at the end of September.

She robustly defended the Government's aid record in the face of a charge by Mr
Neil Kinnock, Leader of the Opposition, that the only way in which she was
prepared to provide short-term aid to the starving was by robbing the hungry of
the world.


Opening exchanges on the famine in sub-Saharan Africa and the Live Aid appeal,
Mr Kinnock said he joined Mrs Thatcher in her praise for the performers and
contributors to Live Aid.

As she has said (Mr Kinnock continued) it was humanity in action, by the same
token is it not inhumanity in action when a government cuts 18 per cent of its
aid budget in real terms in five years; when that same government reduces the
aid budget by pounds 40 million in this year, and when that government in spite
of the emergency in Sudan and Ethiopia over the last two years has not added one
single penny to the aid budget except for the Hercules which she is thinking of
withdrawing?

With a record like that, what price the brotherhood of man then?

Mrs Thatcher: He is comparing taxpayers' aid with voluntary aid. There has
always been a place for voluntary aid. Voluntary services have done a great deal
of overseas aid. Christian Aid, Oxfam, War on Want and Save the Children have
always been active in this field and Live Aid was an extremely welcome addition.

On British aid in 1984 alone we provided pounds 266 million of which pounds 248
million went to sub-Saharan countries including pounds 234 million for long-term
development. On famine relief, in the year to March 1985 we spent pounds 95m on
famine relief operations in Africa. This year we expect to spend at least pounds
60 million.

The Minister for Overseas Development (Mr Timothy Raison) is now in Ethiopia
considering the needs for the future months and especially the need to keep on
with the Hercules.

Mr Kinnock: I am more than prepared to compare government aid, taxpayers' aid,
with the charitable contributions made freely by people in this country.

When I do, I see in the last year, a year in which the Government took pounds 40
million off aid, the people were prepared to subscribe pounds 67 million in aid.
(Conservative shouts of 'What's wrong with that?')

I see too, that the Government has cut an amount which is equivalent to 10 times
that which has been subscribed in the Live Aid concert.

Is not Mrs Thatcher ashamed of the fact that the only way in which she is
prepared to provide short-term aid to the starving is by robbing the hungry of
the world? (Conservative protests.)

I ask Mrs Thatcher to do three things:

First, to reverse this disastrous and cruel cut in aid.

Second, to make a contribution ...

(To renewed Conservative interruptions, Mr Kinnock responded: I can understand
the embarrassment and shame of members opposite.)

. to make a contribution to the international food and agricultural development
fund which helps the poor farmers in Africa.

Third, will she give us a guarantee now that the essential Hercules service will
remain and not be withdrawn for as long as the need exists in Ethiopia?

Mrs Thatcher: The majority of general aid goes to capital projects, capital
long-term projects of the kind he is proposing to take place with regard to the
development of food resources in Africa.

I am very proud of this Government's record in aid. That is what he cannot
stand.

There is always within the aid budget a certain amount of disaster relief and
also a certain amount for contingencies.

This Government was the first to respond to the need for transport to get the
food to those disadvantaged.

Mr Anthony Steen (South Hams, C): Would Mrs Thatcher seek time this afternoon to
drop a congratulatory note to Mr Bob Geldof and thank him for raising pounds 50
million of money to be sent to Ethiopia? Would she also remind him that our
young people, far from being hooligans on the football terraces are in fact as
compassionate and caring as any young people in the world.

Mrs Thatcher: I did, of course, send a letter to Mr Geldof before the concert
congratulating him on the whole idea. We are all delighted at the response. We
congratulate him on not only the result but on the leadership he gave to young
people and humanity everywhere.

 When AIDS first surfaced in Canada three years ago, it was attacking
 Haitians more than people of other national origins. At one point, one in
 four AIDS patients in Canada was born in Haiti.

The disease was affecting men, women and children. All of the 11 women
 in Canada diagnosed with acquired immune deficiency syndrome were Haitian.
 Today, all of them are dead.

Seventeen youngsters in Canada have been diagnosed as having AIDS. All
 but one are Haitian and nine have died.

Newspaper headlines, public health pamphlets and respected research
 institutes said that homosexuals, hemophiliacs, intravenous drug users and
 Haitians had the greatest risk of catching the illness that attacks the
 body's immune system and robs it of its ability to fight off infection.

But researchers have concluded they can no longer single out those of
 Haitian nationality as a high risk for AIDS.

Until recently, no one knew why so many Haitians were affected.

Out of 248 reported AIDS cases in Canada since 1982, 52 have been
 people of Haitian origin. Haitians found themselves standing alone at
 parties. And like many homosexuals thought to have AIDS, they lost
 friends, loved ones and their jobs.
    "People are afraid to sit close to them," says Marie-Luce Amboise, a
 Haitian nurse in Montreal. "They are afraid to talk to them. And, when
 they would come to a hospital with a fever or infection, there would be a
 panic and the person would be isolated and told they have AIDS."
    Today, the proportion of adult AIDS patients from Haiti has dropped
 from 25 per cent to about 15 per cent. It is expected to drop even lower.

As scientists continue to sift through the evidence, they are finding
 that AIDS is not a selective disease that happened to pick on Haitians.

Haitians get AIDS for the same reasons other people catch the virus.
 It's a matter of lifestyle, doctors say. "We weren't able to come up with
 anything that indicated being Haitian itself was a risk factor," John
 Narkunas, a public health adviser with the Centres for Disease Control in
 Atlanta, Ga.

Kenneth Castro, an epidemiologist studying AIDS at the centre, has
 found that men with AIDS in Haiti have had more sex partners than men in
 the study's healthy control group.

Montreal epidemiologist Robert Remis' research supports these findings.
 He says Haitians risk contracting AIDS exactly the same way anyone else
 does - by exchanging bodily fluids (blood, semen and possibly saliva) with
 an AIDS patient, or being born to a mother with AIDS.
    "Obviously, it's not simply being born Haitian or your genetic
 background, but what you do."
    Scientists at the Centres for Disease Control have removed Haitians
 from their list of patient groups with a high risk of contracting AIDS.

At Ottawa's Laboratory Centre for Disease Control, scientists are "in
 the process of eliminating them from risk groups," said Gordon Jessamine,
 a senior epidemiologist.

The reason Haitians were initially branded as a separate high-risk
 group, some medical practitioners say, is that many never acknowledged to
 their doctors that they had slept with a male or female prostitute or had
 used dirty needles to inject drugs.

Homosexuality is a taboo in Haitian society and this has hindered at
 least some Haitians from revealing they may have slept with a male AIDS
 carrier.

Researchers in Haiti recently improved their interviewing techniques,
 said Toronto epidemiologist Stan Read. They are now finding that about 40
 per cent of AIDS victims acknowledge they have engaged in some homosexual
 activity.
    "We can't talk about homosexuality in the Haitian community," Ms
 Amboise said. "There are definitely many homosexuals in the Haitian
 community who get the disease. But we have to guess it or we find it out
 later. We can't say anything and we don't try to make them talk. You can't
 force a person."
    Studies showed most Haitians with AIDS had lifestyles similar to those
 of other AIDS patients, such as a large numbers of sex partners, Dr.
 Castro said. This means that, like other AIDS patients, Haitians
 contracted the disease through sexual contact with another AIDS carrier -
 a woman or a man. Infants with AIDS appear to have been born to women with
 AIDS.

Dr. Read in Toronto says AIDS or AIDS-related illnesses can affect
 anyone. Both are spreading into the heterosexual community.
    "It just happened that (Haitians) are an isolated group into which the
 AIDS virus spread through sex and maybe from needles," he said in a recent
 interview. "It hit with a bang in that group in Quebec."
    Dr. Read said he presumes many Haitians with AIDS moved to Canada
 carrying the virus. The decline in the proportion of Haitians among AIDS
 victims in general is probably happening because Haitians simply happened
 to get it sooner than people in the rest of Canada, he said.

Bureau rejects claim of inadequate aid

BYLINE: MARTIN DALY

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 4

LENGTH: 523 words


The Federal Government's official overseas aid bureau yesterday criticised a
claim that Australia was neglecting the world's poor and trying to make money
from its humanitarian programs.

The criticism was contained in an independent review of aid policies throughout
the world released yesterday by Senator Stephen Loosely (ALP).

The report, by an international consortium of charities and non- government aid
organisations, said the world's richest nations, including Australia, had turned
their backs on the poorest people in the Third World.

But the director-general of the Australian International Development Assistance
Bureau, Mr Philip Flood, rejected the criticisms.

The report said that 13 out of 20 aid donor countries were about to reduce or
freeze their levels of aid to developing countries.

The Federal Government is expected to effectively break a pre-election promise
in next week's Budget by failing to increase overseas aid to 0.4 per cent of the
gross national product by 1995.

The report said that the world's major aid donors, including Australia, spent
more than $60 billion on aid but that a "pitifully small percentage" was spent
on direct help for the poorest people.

Absolute poverty, the report said, blighted the lives of 1.2 billion people in
developing countries.

Mr Russell Rollason, the executive director of the Australian Council for
Overseas Aid, an umbrella organisation for many aid agencies, said none of the
major donors studied could accurately say what proportion of the money was
targeted to meet the needs of the world's poorest people. The council was
involved in preparing the report.

Mr Rollason said estimates indicated that only about 10 per cent of aid was
targeted at alleviating poverty.

"Our study of Australian aid reveals that expenditure on health, family
planning, water supply, sanitation and primary education is well below the
international average for aid donors," Mr Rollason said.

He also said there was increased pressure in Australia and other countries to
link aid programs to commercial advantage.

However, Mr Flood said Australia's contribution to poverty aid was more than the
10 per cent of funds cited in the report. He also said Australia should not be
expected to apologise because its aid programs provided jobs and exports for the
country.

But the report said: "The use of aid to promote exports and subsidise domestic
industry, rather than to benefit very poor people in developing countries, is a
major cause of concern to non-government organisations throughout the OECD
countries".

It also said that more than 90 per cent of Australia's bilateral aid was sourced
in the country. "As well as decreasing the amount of aid they are giving, many
donors are making their aid more commercial," the report said.

Mr Rollason said Australia's economic problems had a disastrous effect on
government aid expenditure.

"Not only should the Australian Government honor its election commitment to
increase its aid to 0.4 per cent of GNP by 1995, but it should also increase the
poverty focus of aid and resist the temptation to turn the aid program into a
disguised trade subsidy," he said.

Scientists swipe at AIDS research; Widely held theory on link to HIV is
challenged

BYLINE: NICHOLAS REGUSH; GAZETTE

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A1/FRONT

LENGTH: 1382 words


Faster than you can say "research grant," the theory of AIDS is turning upside
down. Most scientists have believed since the mid- 1980s that AIDS is caused by
an invader's gradual destruction of the body's defences. Now a clutch of
mavericks, backed by one of the world's most prestigious science journals, are
saying: Wrong. The body attacks itself.

In other words, they're saying AIDS is an auto-immune disease, like arthritis,
not a viral disease, like measles.

HIV, the human immunodefiency virus, does play a role in AIDS, these scientists
say. But it is not the cause of AIDS. Rather, it is only one link in a chain of
conditions necessary for the disease to take hold.

Other scientists have reacted to this by reaffirming their conviction that HIV
may not even be necessary for AIDS to occur.

If either theory is true, it means that current drug treatments can't work
because they are designed to attack HIV. And some experimental vaccines,
designed to protect the body against HIV infection, may actually speed up the
illness.

It also means that thousands of scientists have been barking up the wrong tree
since late 1983, when HIV was proposed as the sole cause of AIDS.

At stake are the lives of countless AIDS sufferers around the world.

An international body of 35 American and British scientists and other
professionals, the Group for the Critical Reappraisal of the HIV Hypothesis, has
also joined the fray, calling for a formal review of the conventional wisdom
about AIDS.

"We want an independent review of AIDS science," Charles Thomas, a molecular
biologist at the Helicon Foundation in San Diego, who organized the group, said
from his office this week.

The group expects to see a short paper outlining its request published soon in
the British medical journal The Lancet, he said.

"If HIV theory turns out to be wrong, we can expect public confidence in the
biological sciences in particular to significantly suffer," said Harvey Bialy,
research editor at the U.S. journal Bio/Technology and a member of the group.

The bickering and backbiting in this latest battle over AIDS grows worse every
day.

But that's predictable, Bialy said.

"Science in general has a herd mentality," he said. "It is much easier to accept
dogma than to be innovative and if a scientist is critical of a prevailing
theory, then it becomes more difficult to get your scientific papers accepted in
a journal and to get research grants."

All this is happening during Canada's first AIDS Awareness Week, meant to
educate people about the condition through displays, workshops and public
forums. To date, 5,349 cases of AIDS have been reported to Canadian health
authorities.

AIDS diagnosis

AIDS occurs after the immune system has collapsed, leaving the body vulnerable
to a variety of diseases it would otherwise neutralize. A diagnosis of AIDS
essentially requires either a sign of HIV infection and the presence of some
AIDS-related diseases, or simply the presence of those diseases that are
particular to AIDS - a rare kind of pneumonia, for example.

The current controversy over the cause of AIDS became public last month, when
University of British Columbia researchers Tracy Kion and Geoffrey Hoffmann
published results of studies in mice in the U.S. journal Science. Their data
suggest that HIV does not attack the immune system directly, as most AIDS
researchers believe, but rather stimulates the immune system to attack itself.

This suggests that HIV is only the trigger of a complicated immune- system
battle that results in disease, Kion and Hoffmann say.

It is necessary for AIDS but not sufficient.

A week later, a report in Nature, the prestigious British science journal,
complemented the UBC research. British researchers showed that a vaccine against
a monkey version of HIV may also trigger an immune response to body cells as
well as, or instead of, a response to the virus itself.

This again suggests that scientists may have misunderstood the role of HIV in
AIDS.

If AIDS is an auto-immune disease, some vaccines being tested that stimulate the
immune system could actually speed up the course of illness, because the immune
system is already overactive.

"We should be working on vaccines that suppress part of the immune system rather
than boost it," UBC's Hoffman said this week.

As for current drugs like AZT and DDI that are intended to treat AIDS, they are
primarily meant to attack the replication of HIV in the body.

But on the basis of the UBC experiments, Hoffman would like to "have a drug that
suppresses the particular types of immune system reactions that are doing the
damage."

In an editorial in its Sept. 27 edition, Nature heralded the UBC research as a
possible breakthrough that could cause a revolution in the search for better
treatment and prevention of AIDS.

Nature editor John Maddox wrote in the editorial that the new research, with its
suggestions that AIDS is an auto-immune disease, "must cause heart-searching
throughout the world's (centres) of AIDS research."

But Maddox added fuel to the fire by linking his assessment of the the UBC
research to the claims of Peter Duesberg, a molecular biologist at the
University of California, who has fought against the HIV theory of AIDS since
1987.

Duesberg believes evidence for the role of HIV in AIDS is extremely poor.

For instance, he has challenged the widely held view that key components of the
immune system called T-cells are gradually destroyed by HIV as the virus
multiplies and infects more and more of them.

Duesberg has pointed out that too few T-cells are infected by the virus for this
pattern to be the cause of AIDS.

Duesberg also said he has come across cases of AIDS without any signs of HIV
virus in the patient.

Maddox suggested that Duesberg "is probably sleeping more easily at night"
because "the (UBC research) shows that the virus is not the mechanism of the
(T-cell destruction) but it happens through an auto-immune effect."

Mention of Duesberg in the editorial took many scientists by surprise,
especially since Maddox has refused for over a year to allow Duesberg to present
a rebuttal of an article in Nature that dressed him down for his anti-HIV
stance.

"Many are very cross," Maddox said in an interview from his office in London
this week. "It offends a lot of people that Duesberg might have a grain of truth
in what he's been saying."

An article this week in another British science magazine, New Scientist, quotes
a number of AIDS researchers angered by the mention of Duesberg, calling the
Maddox editorial "outrageous," "woolly" and "confused."

"It's a very bitchy piece," Maddox acknowledged.

Some British scientists also question the UBC results, claiming the study has
weaknesses.

"Scientists are sometimes slow to accept new information," UBC's Hoffman said.
But beyond question, "the study has increased the amount of interest in
auto-immunity (in AIDS)."

But Duesberg is far less charitable to both the AIDS establishment and the UBC
researchers.

"I see what is happening as announcing the inevitable failure of the theory that
HIV is the cause of AIDS," he said this week.

Duesberg dismisses the UBC study as a last-ditch effort to hang on to the HIV
theory.

He calls it "the AIDS theory of the month."

Hoffmann believes HIV is the trigger for AIDS, but he also allows that it may be
possible for cytomegalovirus (CMV), a member of the herpes virus family, to
provoke a similarly complex immmune-system response.

Variety of AIDS triggers

"At a meeting in Paris, it was suggested to me that CMV can be a trigger as
well. It could fit."

Duesberg believes there may be a variety or combination of triggers for AIDS,
especially involving chemical substances found in intravenous and recreational
drugs like heroin and cocaine used by at least two-thirds of North Americans who
have developed AIDS.

Nature editor Maddox shows he has not aligned himself with Duesberg, referring
to his drug theory as "absolutely balmy."

Bio/Technology's Bialy gives the entire controversy an upbeat spin, calling it a
sign of the changing times.

"It signifies a general willingness to seriously reconsider the theoretical
formulations of the AIDS field," he said.

In Shift, Gay Men's Health Group Endorses Testing for AIDS Virus

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

SECTION: Section A; Page 1, Column 1; Metropolitan Desk

LENGTH: 1037 words


Gay Men's Health Crisis, New York City's largest private organization providing
AIDS services, has reversed a long-held position and endorsed widespread
voluntary testing for the virus that causes AIDS.

The group joined a growing nationwide shift among former critics of testing who
agree that new drugs that fight AIDS can prolong life, particularly if the virus
is detected early.

''There are compelling reasons to get tested,'' said Richard Dunne, executive
director of Gay Men's Health Crisis, at a news conference yesterday in its
headquarters in Manhattan.

Untested Majority

In addition to the new drugs, Mr. Dunne cited the growing protection of AIDS
confidentiality and anti-discrimination laws.

His nonprofit group is planning to pay for advertisements in several New York
City daily and weekly newspapers saying, ''If you haven't taken the antibody
test for the AIDS virus - think about it, because now there are choices.''

Most of the people estimated to be infected with the AIDS virus have never been
tested, health experts say.

Gay Men's Health Crisis, along with other gay organizations, led the resistance
to the test when it was devised five years ago as an indication of infection.

At the time, skeptics questioned the test's accuracy and its ability to predict
the development of AIDS. They also warned of potential harm and abuses,
including discrimination against those who took the test and emotional trauma
suffered by those who tested positive. Ultimately, they argued, there was little
that medical science could do for someone who tested positive.

Medically Crucial

Gradually, as these factors changed, opposition to testing has receded. In April
the San Francisco AIDS Foundation, the largest private AIDS agency in that city,
encouraged people to consider being tested. Earlier, Project Inform, a San
Francisco group focusing on experimental drugs, also urged testing.

The announcement by Gay Men's Health Crisis is the first major shift among AIDS
organizations in New York. Joining in the news conference yesterday were Debra
Fraser-Howze, executive director of the Black Leadership Commission on AIDS;
Roberto Soto, president of the Hispanic AIDS Forum, and Rory Buchanan, education
specialist of the Minority Task Force on AIDS, who also endorsed testing.

By now, the AIDS test is accepted as medically crucial, with half those testing
positive developing symptoms within a decade of infection. Meanwhile, city,
state and Federal laws have been enacted that prohibit many forms of
discrimination against those with AIDS.

The Federal Government approved AZT as an effective medication to slow the
growth of the virus in full-fledged AIDS cases, and more recently the drug was
shown to help in earlier stages of infection. #95 Drugs The Government also
approved pentamidine, a medication for pneumocystis pneumonia carinii, often the
first sign of full-fledged AIDS and by far the most common cause of death among
AIDS patients. Originally used to prevent recurrence of pneumocystis,
pentamidine is now recommended by Federal health officials for people with
impaired immune systems to prevent the first episode of pneumocystis and thus
stave off full-fledged AIDS.

All told, there are 95 prescription drugs that people are using to fight the
AIDS virus or various opportunistic diseases, Mr. Dunne said.

The new campaign stops short of recommending that everyone at risk for infection
must be tested. ''We have always felt that testing should be an individual
decision,'' Mr. Dunne said. ''Knowing one's test result is very powerful, and
some may not be able to handle it.''

Proper counseling is essential before and after taking the test, AIDS experts
agree. Gay Men's Health Crisis provides advice, leaflets, seminars, support
groups and referrals on such issues as drugs, insurance and legal questions.

Anonymous Testing

Mr. Dunne urged those considering a test to call the Gay Men's Health Crisis hot
line, (212) 807-6655 and TDD (212) 645-7470 for the hearing impaired. The City
Health Department's AIDS hot line is (718) 485-8111.

For those who decide to be tested, Mr. Dunne recommended the test sites operated
by the city, where no names are used. The State Health Department operates
similar sites.

Several advocates for people with AIDS who attended the news conference,
including Michael Petrellis and Iris Long, questioned the promoting of testing
when the city's AIDS services and experimental drug trials were still limited.

Mr. Dunne acknowledged their concern and said AIDS organizations must hold Mayor
Edward I. Koch to his recent promises for expanded AIDS care. The efforts to
have more people tested, Mr. Dunne said, ''must be matched by a commitment from
government to make services available to all who need them.''

Size of Problem Is Unknown

Some critics remain opposed to the AIDS test. Charles Ortleb, publisher of The
New York Native, a weekly newspaper aimed at gay readers, does not believe that
AIDS results from the human immunodeficiency virus that most experts accept as
the cause.

Official estimates of AIDS infection range from the City Health Department's
figure of 200,000 citywide to as many as 400,000 statewide, with most of them in
the city, according to the State Health Department. State officials believe only
about 10 percent of those currently infected have been tested. Mr. Dunne thinks
the figure is about a third.

''It was not too long ago when G.M.H.C. and other advocacy groups were not very
supportive on testing,'' said the city's Health Commissioner, Dr. Stephen C.
Joseph, ''and to see them come out full-forward is terrific.''

But Dr. Joseph said the campaign ''doesn't go far enough.'' He believes the
names of infected people tested through physicians, clinics and hospitals should
be confidentially reported to the Health Department for tracing of their sexual
and needle-sharing drug contacts.

When Dr. Joseph proposed that approach in June, Gay Men's Health Crisis was
among the many groups attacking it, persuading Mr. Koch to place the plan on
hold.

Mr. Dunne said Gay Men's Health Crisis remains staunchly opposed to reporting
names and requiring the tracing of contacts.

In Cradle of AIDS Theory, a Defensive Africa Sees a Disguise for Racism

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

SECTION: Section B; Page 13, Column 1; Foreign Desk

LENGTH: 1318 words

DATELINE: LAGOS, Nigeria,


When Nigeria's first national AIDS conference opened last month, delegates were
greeted with an accusation that is increasingly heard across Africa.

The theory that AIDS originated in Africa is a stalking horse for anti-black
racism, charged Lieut. Col. Abdul Mumini Aminu, governor of the Nigerian state
of Borno.

This theory, the governor said, ''is reminiscent of a colonial mentality which
capitalizes on our weakness and underdevelopment to unjustifiably attribute
everything that is bad and negative to the so-called dark continent.''

Science's Search for Origin

Western scientists tend to see the question of where AIDS originated as a
scientific and medical issue, not a political one. They say knowledge of the
origins of the virus may help the search for vaccines or treatments.

But in much the way American homosexuals worry that fear about AIDS will feed
discrimination against them, Africans worry that depictions of Africa as the
cradle of AIDS will feed anti-African racism in the United States and Europe.

Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is an incurable disease that cripples the
immune system, leaving the victim susceptible to some infections and cancers. In
Europe and the United States, the primary means of transmission of the AIDS
virus are homosexual intercourse and in exchanges of blood, as in shared
hypodermic needles. In Africa, the virus is largely transmitted by heterosexual
sex.

Campaign in Africa's Press

Across Africa, the press has bristled at the theory - widely accepted in the
West - that AIDS originated in Central Africa. Advocates of this theory note
that the earliest known blood samples showing human infection with the AIDS
virus were taken in Kinshasa, Zaire, in 1959. They also note the rising evidence
that the AIDS virus is part of a family of related viruses that appear to have
evolved in Africa and infect primates - some infecting humans and some infecting
monkeys.

''AIDS is not African,'' said the headline of a recent article in the Ivory
Coast daily Fraternite-Matin.

''Everything that is bad comes from Africa and everything that is good comes
from Europe and the United States,'' Edmond Paul Assya, an Ivorian psychologist,
wrote bitterly. ''To want to attribute AIDS to Africans is to also deliberately
encourage racism and to reinforce racist ideologies.''

In Cameroon, a journalist writing in La Gazette, an independent newspaper,
accused Westerners of bringing AIDS to Africa through ''their sexual
peversions.''

Denigration by West Is Seen

Attacking Western reporting on AIDS in Africa, the reporter wrote of ''the
campaign of systematic denigration undertaken against black Africa by those who
want to make us believe that they sympathize with our misfortunes.''

Jeune Afrique, a regional French-language magazine, recently used the headline:
''AIDS alert? Racism alert!''

In Nigeria, the Lagos daily Guardian lashed out against ''highly organized smear
campaigns'' designed ''to infuse a new inferiority complex'' on black men.

''Since the days of colonialism, Africa is now facing the most serious racist
onslaught,'' David Ogunsade and Foluso Opadina wrote in an article. ''The
Western press intend to use AIDS propaganda to further disrupt African
economies.''

'United States of AIDS'

Cartoons in the Nigerian press routinely depict the AIDS virus or an AIDS
carrier wrapped in American flags.

One cartoon in The Guardian showed worried Nigerians at a United States visa
office asking for vaccinations against AIDS. The American flag was labeled
''United States of AIDS.''

According to the State Department, Africa has proved to be a particularly
fertile ground for a Soviet campaign seeking to attribute AIDS to American
military germ warfare research. Although the Soviet Government newspaper
Izvestia recently published a disavowal by two Soviet scientists of those
allegations, the theory has taken root. And the idea continues to echo through
the African press with increasing frequency. [In Washington, a State Department
official who monitors Soviet reporting, said, ''The story now has a life of its
own regardless of what the Soviets say.'' [''We've had several incidents of
repetition of the disinformation'' since the disavowal, the official said.

''Africa is the place where it is most likely to occur.''] Allegations Are
Repeated In 1986, monitors in the State Deparment spotted the allegation in the
African press for the first time. That year, the press in 10 sub-Saharan
countries carried the germ warfare charge. In the first six months of 1987, 11
countries repeated it, the State Department reported recently.

Last year, Radio Moscow warned Kenyans of AIDS-infected American sailors during
a United States Navy visit to Mombasa. This year, Radio Moscow broadcast that
the United States was spreading AIDS in southern Zaire as a test of biological
warfare.

Last year, a Zimbabwe magazine published an article entitled: ''AIDS: USA
Home-Made Evil; Not Imported from Africa.'' Last July, Le Devoir, a Senegalese
monthly printed a similar article under the headline: ''AIDS: Professor Claims
Yankee Business, Not Monkey Business.''

On Oct. 30, Izvestia published an article by two Soviet scientists that
distanced the Soviet Academy of Sciences from this position. The scientists,
Roald Sagdeyev and Vitali Goldansky, said they have protested the publication by
Soviet newspapers of the germ warfare claim. The timing of the article suggested
that it had been written in response to complaints raised by Secretary of State
George P. Shultz about Soviet discussion of the AIDS issue, in a meeting with
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, on Oct. 23.

A Widespread Belief

Today, whether through wishful thinking or the success of the Soviet campaign,
many Africans say they believe that AIDS entered Africa from the West.

''I don't believe that AIDS came from Africa,'' a British-trained obstetrician
remarked at a beach resort near Lagos. ''I think it came from the West.''

In Conakry, Guinea, a United States Embassy official complained recently that
she was making little headway persuading local employees - let alone the public
- that AIDS was not imported from the United States.

United States has the largest number of reported AIDS cases in the world, about
45,000 as of this month. In Africa, experts say, many AIDS cases have not been
reported and in several countries the disease is common. In several cities in
central and eastern Africa, recent studies have found that as many as 1 in 10
adults carry the AIDS virus.

Health Problem Seen as Minor

Many Africans brush off AIDS as a minor health problem in the African context.

For example, here in Nigeria, where only several people have died of AIDS, 102
children died during an outbreak of measles recently in Cross River State. Each
year, an estimated one million Nigerian children die of diarrhea.

''We should not exaggerate this disease,'' Senegal's Health Minister, Marie Sarr
M'Bodj, said recently of AIDS. ''Worldwide, it does not kill more than malaria,
tuberculosis or cancer.''

But experts warn that an unchecked AIDS epidemic could have a catastrophic
impact on Africa. Largely an urban phenomenon in Africa, AIDS has the potential
to decimate the continent's fledgling elites who are essential for development.

At the United Nations last month, the General Assembly adopted a resolution
calling for a ''global battle against AIDS.''

''We must unequivocally establish that our battle is against AIDS, and not
against people,'' said Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar.

Jonathan Mann, director of the World Health Organization's special program on
AIDS, echoed a similar theme.

''Unfortunately,'' he said, ''as anxiety and fear cause some to blame others,
AIDS have unveiled thinly disguised prejudices about race, religion, social

AIDS Deaths in New York Are Showing New Pattern

BYLINE: By RONALD SULLIVAN

SECTION: Section B; Page 1, Column 5; Metropolitan Desk

LENGTH: 1298 words


Dramatically revising current official statistics, top New York City health
officials reported yesterday that AIDS has killed more intravenous drug addicts
than homosexuals in the city.

The number of AIDS-related deaths among intravenous drug users in New York City
is more than 150 percent higher than previously reported, the officials said. As
a result, they said, the AIDS epidemic is far more rampant among drug users than
had been believed.

The higher numbers of AIDS deaths involving drug addicts, said the City Health
Commissioner, Dr. Stephen C. Joseph, means that ''homosexual men no longer are
the major group at risk in the city.

'Absolutely Startling'

Dr. Joseph said the new estimates were ''absolutely startling'' and ''pointed to
the future direction of this deadly disease.''

City health officials said a study of all drug-related deaths in the city from
1982 through 1986 found that an estimated 2,520 AIDS-related deaths were not
officially included in the city's AIDS Surveillance Registry.

They said this meant AIDS-related deaths involving intravenous drug users
accounted for 53 percent of all AIDS-related deaths that have occurred in the
city since the epidemic began, while deaths involving sexually active homosexual
and bisexual men accounted for 38 percent.

Sharp Contrast

These figures contrasted sharply with official statistics that showed homosexual
and bisexual men accounting for 55 percent of all AIDS-related deaths, and
intravenous drug users for 31 percent.

In light of the new statistics, the principal author of the new study, Dr. Rand
Stoneburner, a City Health Department epidemiologist, called for a revision in
the city's current efforts to stem the epidemic. He said efforts to stop the
spread of acquired immune deficiency syndrome among poor Hispanic and black New
Yorkers by primarily emphasizing education and the use of condoms ''simply are
not going to succeed.'' ''What will succeed, '' he said, ''are drug treatment
programs and efforts to stem the cause of addiction in poor communities.''

The uncounted deaths involving intravenous drug users were 152 percent higher
than the 1,658 deaths officially recognized as AIDS-related, as defined by the
Federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.

A spokesman for the Federal agency, Gail Lloyd, said there would be no comment
from the agency until Federal health officials had read the city's report.

The 2,520 deaths were not counted, the city officials said, because they did not
meet the strict Federal criteria for defining AIDS, which generally require that
a person have been infected with the virus that causes AIDS and have one of the
major opportunistic diseases associated with the infection, such as pneumocystis
carinii pneumonia and Kaposi's sarcoma.

However, a study conducted by the city's Department of Health said the uncounted
deaths that were studied showed clear signs of other AIDS-related illnesses,
such as oral thrush, which is a fungal infection of the mouth; unusual kinds of
pneumonia, and endocarditis, or heart infection.

Dr. Joseph said the findings of the new study justified an ''all-out effort'' to
stop the spread of AIDS in black and Hispanic neighborhoods that are at highest
risk to drug abuse and AIDS infection. The higher numbers, he added, showed that
the heterosexual ''window'' through which AIDS presumably could jump to people
who were not at high risk was ''much wider than we believed.''

Nevertheless, health officials emphasized that there was no evidence that AIDS
was spreading beyond homosexual men, intravenous drug users and their immediate
sex partners.

Six months ago, Dr. Joseph warned that the number of AIDS-related deaths among
drug addicts might be 50 percent higher than had previously been reported.

But Dr. Stoneburner said Dr. Joseph's initial estimates were far too
conservative - or three times less than the latest statistics showed. #32%
Annual Increase In a paper delivered yesterday to the American Public Health
Association's annual convention in New Orleans, Dr. Stoneburner said:

''Concurrent with the AIDS epidemic in New York City, large increases in deaths
have occurred among intravenous drug users during a time when their population
remained relatively constant. Between 1981 and 1986, narcotics-related deaths
increased by an average of 32 percent a year - from 492 deaths in 1981 to 1,996
in 1986.

''We hypothesize that many of these deaths are AIDS-related and are not being
recognized as AIDS.''

Estimate by Health Officials

City health officials estimated that half of the city's 200,000 intravenous drug
users were infected with the virus that causes AIDS and that at least 30 percent
or more of them would contract the deadly opportunistic infections associated
with AIDS within five years.

All told, the officials said, New York City has had a total of nearly 12,000
cases of AIDS since the epidemic began in 1981, or 28 percent of the 42,353
cases in the nation reported by the Centers for Disease Control.

However, New York City has about half of all the country's AIDS cases related to
intravenous drug use, in which the virus is spread by sharing contaminated
needles or through intimate heterosexual contact.

'Right Up There'

According to Dr. Joseph, the vast majority of AIDS cases in San Fransisco
involve homosexuals. He said the reverse was true in states such as New Jersey,
where the majority of AIDS cases have involved intravenous drug users. ''We used
to believe that New York City was somewhere in the middle,'' he said. ''But not
any longer. We're right up there with New Jersey.'' According to Dr. Joseph, the
spread of AIDS related to drug use has already affected people who do not use
drugs. For example, of the 1,003 women who have contracted the disease, 22
percent of them were infected sexually by AIDS-infected partners.

He also said that 600 babies of AIDS-infected mothers would be delivered this
year, compared with the estimated 100 to 200 infected babies born in New York
City last year.

The Centers for Disease Control predict that there will be a total of 271,000
AIDS cases in the country by 1991.

Telltale Trends

Dr. Stoneburner said epidemiologists were able to track the uncharted progress
of AIDS among drug addicts because the city has mandated since the 1960's that
every narcotics-related death be referred to the City Medical Examiner's office
to determine the actual cause of death.

He said 8,447 such deaths were studied from 1978 through 1986 to look for
telltale trends of AIDS infection that did not meet Federal criteria.

For example, a study of death certificates, tissues saved by the Medical
Examiner's office and hospital charts showed sharp increases in the diagnoses of
various forms of pneumonia, tuberculosis and endocarditis that had previously
not been evident in such deaths but which now were commonly associated with a
diagnosis of AIDS.

In comparision, diseases commonly associated with drug addiction, such as liver
disease, showed no appreciable increase.

Data From Hospital Charts

Further evidence of AIDS was found on hospital charts, which showed that of a
sample number of cases of deaths from pneumonia, tuberculosis and endocarditis
studied, 43 percent had diagnoses of oral thrush, a clinical finding consistent
with AIDS-related disease.

Nevertheless, those deaths were not counted.

The study also showed that tuberculosis, which later was added by Federal
officials as an opportunistic AIDS-related disease, was associated with many
deaths that went uncounted, too.

The study applied those findings to the total number of narcotics-related deaths
in the city since the AIDS epidemic began, 6,157, and arrived at the 2,520
figure for unreported AIDS cases.

Thinking bigger on development

BYLINE: Joseph Ingram And Aniket Bhushan, Ottawa Citizen

SECTION: ARGUMENTS; Pg. B7

The new Department of Foreign Affairs Trade and Development is an opportunity to
elevate the profile of international development in Canadian foreign policy.

In its recent budget, the government of Canada announced the "amalgamation" of
the Canadian International Development Agency into the Department of Foreign
Affairs and International Trade. Much of the discussion surrounding this move
has been entirely insular and backward looking. This merger offers a unique
opportunity to think bigger on development.

First let's shed some light on the channels of aid delivery. While big bilateral
donors provide the bulk of foreign aid, they are hardly ever the only channel
even within their own countries. French aid, for instance, is delivered through
six different ministries and departments, Spanish aid through seven, German aid
(until recently) seven, and in the most extreme example of fragmentation U.S.
aid is delivered through 15 different departments and agencies.

So at the outset there is a clear case for reform within donor countries and
this has been happening. The most recent example is Germany which in 2011
undertook major reforms that restructured and consolidated three large aid and
technical co-operation agencies into a single ministry, to both drive
efficiencies and increase the profile of international development.

In Canada, CIDA was never alone. DFAIT, the departments of defence and finance,
the International Development Research Centre and RCMP are all important
channels of Canadian aid. Back in 2000 more than 75 per cent of Canada's aid was
delivered through CIDA. By 2011, CIDA's share had declined to around 63 per
cent.

It is very hard to glean anything solely from whether a bilateral aid agency is
independent or part of a wider ministry. However, that several bilateral donors
have been simplifying complex aid bureaucracies is not only important from the
perspective of administrative efficiency, but also from the perspective of
reducing the burden on partner countries.

An interesting case study for Canada could be Denmark. In the 1990s Denmark
undertook a major administrative reorganization where DANIDA (the Danish aid
agency) went from being an independent unit to being part of a single-string
service in the ministry of foreign affairs. What happened to the volume of
Danish aid? According to the latest figures Danish aid expressed as a share of
gross national income (GNI), exceeded the global 0.7 per cent of GNI target. In
2011 Denmark gave 0.85 per cent of GNI in aid, while Canada gave only 0.32 per
cent. Clearly, the folding of DANIDA into the foreign ministry did not lead to
reneging on aid commitments.

What about the quality of Danish aid? According to the latest data from the
Quality of Official Development Assistance report, on both "fostering
institutions" in aid receiving countries, and "reducing the burden" on its
recipients, Denmark fares better than Canada. In fact, folding DANIDA into the
foreign affairs ministry had the effect of raising the profile of development
assistance in Danish foreign policy.

Are aid agencies located within foreign affairs ministries more cost effective?
The average administrative cost of providing aid as a share of bilateral
assistance is around 6.5 per cent. At 7.6 per cent, Canada places above average.
The costs of more generous donors including Norway, Sweden, Netherlands,
Switzerland and Denmark, where aid is located within the ministries of foreign
affairs, is similar to or even higher than Canada, while the cost of U.K., U.S.,
German and French aid is far lower. Clearly, there is a case for making aid at
least more efficient by rationalizing big aid bureaucracies, regardless of
whether independent or located within Foreign Affairs.

Is there a case for closer alignment between foreign aid and commercial
interests? One may ask, what commercial ends has aid ever served? Consider the
following. While Haiti and Afghanistan are the largest Canadian aid recipients
today, historically the bulk of Canadian as well as global aid has gone to
countries such as India, China, Indonesia, Vietnam and Bangladesh. Aid has
played a critical role in the "emergence" of emerging economies, as it has the
potential to do in Africa and Asia today.

Back in the 1960s and '70s, aid played a huge role in countries such as
Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and South Korea. Strikingly, South Korea in 1961
was as aid reliant as a share of national income as Benin, Nicaragua, Madagascar
and Senegal are today. Yet today Korea is one of our most important trading
partners and a major aid donor in its own right. There is no real reason why
commercial and long-term development interest should be at loggerheads.

The amalgamation of CIDA into DFATD has the potential to bring a longer-term
perspective into foreign policy thinking. But amalgamation should not become an
excuse for policy paralysis or indifference.

It is now even more important to have a clear international policy statement
that helps calibrate short-term (diplomatic strategy) and long-term (development
outcomes) priorities which some perceive as contradictory. This is also an
opportune moment to re-emphasize Canada's commitment to aid effectiveness,
transparency and accountability. Ultimately, if we want it to, this
reorganization presents a unique opportunity to elevate the profile of
development in Canadian foreign policy.

North-South Institute.

SAVVY SENIOR;
How to save money on hearing aids

BYLINE: Jim Miller

SECTION: LIFE; Pg. P3D

LENGTH: 675 words


Dear Savvy Senior,

Where can we find affordable hearing aids? My husband needs a set but we can't
really afford to pay the exorbitant prices. Can you help us?

- Loud-Talking Wife

Dear Loud,

It's unfortunate, but millions of Americans with hearing loss don't get hearing
aids because they simply can't afford them. Hearing aids typically sold through
audiologists' offices are expensive, usually costing between $1,000 to $3,500
per ear. What's more, traditional Medicare doesn't cover them and private
insurance typically hasn't either.

But there are numerous ways to save on hearing aids if you know where to look.
Here are a few tips.

Check Your Insurance

While most private health insurance companies do not cover hearing aids, there
are a few that do. United Healthcare, for example, offers high-tech custom
hearing aids to their beneficiaries through HealthInnovations for $599 to $899
each. And a small number of other plans will pitch in $500 to $1,000 towards the
cost of hearing aids, or give you a discount if you purchase hearing aids from a
contracted provider.

And due to state law mandates, three states - Arkansas, New Hampshire and Rhode
Island - currently require private insurance companies to provide hearing aid
coverage for adults and 20 require it for children. So check with your insurance
provider to see if it offers a hearing aid benefit.

If your husband is a Medicare beneficiary you should know that while original
Medicare (Part A and B) and Medigap supplemental policies do not cover hearing
aids, there are some Medicare Advantage (Part C) plans that do. To look for a
plan in your area that covers hearing aids visit Medicare.gov/find-a-plan.

If he is a current or retired federal employee enrolled in the Federal Employees
Health Benefits Program, some plans provide hearing aid coverage, including the
Blue Cross Blue Shield plan that covers hearing aids every three years up to
$2,500.

And, if you are on Medicaid, most state programs cover hearing aids, but
requirements vary. To find out if he qualifies, contact your state's Medicaid
program or visit Medicaid.gov.

Veterans Benefit

If your husband is a veteran, the VA provides a hearing aid benefit if his
hearing loss was connected to military service or linked to a medical condition
treated at a VA hospital. He can also get hearing aids through the VA if his
hearing loss is severe enough to interfere with his activities of daily life. To
learn more, call 877-222-8387 or visit VA.gov.

Assistance Programs

If your income is low, there are various programs and foundations that provide
financial assistance for hearing aids to people in need. Start by calling your
state vocational rehabilitation department (see parac.org/svrp.html) to find out
if there are any city, county or state programs, or local civic organizations
that could help.

Also contact Sertoma (Sertoma.org, 816-333-8300), a civic service organization
that offers a comprehensive list of state and national hearing aid assistance
programs on their website. Or call the National Institute on Deafness and Other
Communication Disorders at 800-241-1044, and ask them to mail you their list of
financial resources for hearing aids.

Cheaper Buying Options

If you are unable to get a third party to help pay for your husbands hearing
aids, you can still save significantly by purchasing his hearing aids at Costco
or online.

Most Costco stores sell top brands of hearing aids for 30 to 50 percent less
than other warehouse chains, hearing aid dealers or audiologists. This includes
an in-store hearing aid test, fitting by a hearing aid specialist and follow-up
care.

And websites like EmbraceHearing. com and Audicus. com, sell quality hearing
aids directly from the manufacturer for as little as $400 or $500. But, he will
need to get a hearing evaluation from a local audiologist first, which can cost
between $50 and $200.

Report says foreign aid to Bhutan projected to decline

LENGTH: 481 words


Text of report headlined "Foreign aid projected to decline" published by
Bhutanese newspaper Kuensel website on 22 April

Foreign aid to Bhutan in the form of the country programmable aid (CPA) will
decline by USD 32M (million) from 2013 to 2015, according to a recent report
published by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).

The CPA is the total amount of aid that comes through co-operation agreements
between the government and donor agencies, minus short-term assistance like
humanitarian aid.

The country will see a decline in development aid for three consecutive years -
from USD 135M in 2013, USD 116M in 2014 and USD 103M this year. The Paris-based
OECD has classified Bhutan as one of the lower middle income countries (LMICs),
which means that the country's per capita income ranges from USD 1,006 to USD
3,975.

The annual report "2014 Global Outlook on Aid" was prepared based on donor
countries' spending plans and provides an overview of global aid allocations up
to 2017. It is also a key tool for the international community to better assess
the prospects for meeting aid commitments, and to flag potential gaps in aid
provision ahead of time.

"Though the overall aid levels are expected to increase over the coming years,
foreign aid in heavily aid-dependent countries has been stagnant," the report
states.

However, the country will see a marginal increase in aid from USD 103M in 2015
to USD 106M in 2016. In 2017, Bhutan is expected to receive USD 105M.

Per capita aid to Bhutan is also expected to fall from USD 180.7 in 2013 to USD
139.2 in 2017 due to population growth. But still this will be higher than that
of many countries.

This means that each person will receive USD 180.7 in 2013 and USD 139.2 by
2017, if the total aid is to be distributed equally among all the people.

Aid to aid-dependent countries like Bhutan is projected to increase by four
percent in real terms in 2014. From 2015 onwards, aid levels are projected to be
relatively stable.

Bhutan has about 60 development partners including bilateral donors and
international organisations. There is a resource deficit of about Nu 15B
(billion) in the 11th Plan that would need to be met through aid. The total
estimated budget for the 11th Plan is Nu 214B.

Meanwhile, the OECD states that two-thirds of poor countries are expected to see
a decline in assistance from donor countries based on the CPA of 36 donor
countries for the period 2014-17.

"Aid per capita is expected to decline at a faster pace as a consequence of
steady population growth," said the OECD. "The worrying trend of a continued
decline in programme aid to LDCs merits international attention as part of the
post-2015 financing framework."

Bangladesh, Nepal and Cambodia will be receiving a higher amount of foreign aid
while most countries will see a decline.

AIDS spreading at alarming pace in J&K, 73 people get infected every month

LENGTH: 651 words

DATELINE: JAMMU


JAMMU, Oct. 19 -- Beware! AIDS is spreading at an alarming pace in Jammu and
Kashmir with around 73 cases being reported every month.

Figure of 73 when seen arithmetically brings to light a shocking fact that 2
cases are reported on daily basis where either an Adult gets infected with AIDS
or a child or an elderly becomes the victim. Though the number is too small but
for a small state like Jammu and Kashmir which is known across the country as
land of Sufis and saints and where metropolitan culture is still some distance
away, doctors accept that the increase is not only alarming but requires serious
corrective measures.

According to the fact sheet on Jammu and Kashmir brought out by Department of
AIDS Control of the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, J&K reported
5812 cases of AIDS in the year 2011. This included 163 cases in which children
had got infected with AIDS. 311 cases of elderly people over the age group of 49
years were also reported as AIDS infected in the same year. Since the data for
the last two years is being tabulated and would be made public somewhere in the
month of December, rough data does vindicate that the number of people infected
with AIDS has reached 8000 in Jammu and Kashmir.

The data for the year 2011 on the basis of which fact sheet has been prepared
further shows that the number of AIDS cases have shown sharp increase from the
year 2007 to 2011. According to this data, J&K reported 2433 cases of AIDS in
the year 2011 and this number is now at staggering 8000 in the year 2014. This
is threefold increase in the number of AIDS cases being reported in J&K in the
last 8 years. Though the data for this year i.e. 2014 is being tabulated in New
Delhi, the available data upto the year 2011 also shows two-fold increase in the
number of AIDS cases.

Of the number of reported AIDS cases, there was increase of around 596 cases in
year 2008 from what was reported in the year 2007. 2433 AIDS cases were reported
in the year 2007. This increased to 3029 in 2008, 3772 in the year 2009, 4688 in
2010 and 5812 in 2011. The figures clearly show how the cases of children,
elderly and adult getting infected with AIDS have increased during these five
years. Of these, the number of male which got infected with AIDS is far higher
than the number of females. 1554 more males have got infected with AIDS than
females.

More alarming is that 146 AIDS related deaths have also been reported from
various parts of Jammu and Kashmir in the year 2011. This number is today
hovering over 200. The number of new infections which have been reported in the
year 2014 so far is around 2500. This increase has taken place despite state
government claiming of having provided more than 23, 946 counselling and testing
services to the suspected individuals across the state.

National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) further estimates that J&K has 14,600
people with HIV, with a sizeable number of these in Kashmir. However, Jammu and
Kashmir Aids Preventive Control Society (JKAPCS) in the year 2007 reported 211
cases of AIDS compared to 34 in 2006. This was six-fold increase in one year.
The government also reported 42 AIDS deaths in 2007. However, not much was done
on the ground to ensure that AIDS related cases do not go unreported.

People with TB or any of the other AIDS-related opportunistic infections may not
be recorded as having AIDS. This is especially so when ignorance and the fear of
being shunned by family and friends prevents most people from seeking testing
and, if necessary, treatment. Doctors may hesitate to report AIDS fearing that
the report will leak out and cause stigma to the person and family. So reports
of AIDS cases provide limited information.

Researchers find one-fifth of foreign aid never leaves donor countries

BYLINE: Claire Provosttheguardian.com

LENGTH: 1049 words

ABSTRACT

New study estimates $22bn of official development assistance reported in 2011
was not transferred to developing countries

FULL TEXT

At least 20% of the aid money rich countries say they give to developing
countries never actually leaves their shores, according to new research.

Researchers at the Bristol-based group Development Initiatives estimate that at
least $22bn (£13.7bn) of the $100bn-plus reported by donors as bilateral
official development assistance (ODA) in 2011 was never transferred to
developing countries. The money was instead spent on activities in donor
countries, or put towards the cancellation or rescheduling of debts.

"There is a lack of understanding about what aid is," said the researchers in a
report published on Monday to coincide with discussions at this week's UN
general assembly about what targets should replace the millennium development
goals (MDGs) when they expire in 2015.

"Large headline figures are presented as if aid is entirely a cash lump sum
passed directly from donor to recipient," added the researchers. "[But] aid is a
bundle of different things. Some of it is money. Some is food and other goods.
Some is people: the costs of consultants and staff providing technical advice
and training."

Rich countries report their aid spending annually to the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in Paris, though their submissions
are rarely subjected to rigorous independent scrutiny.

Development Initiatives examined more than a million rows of data from the
OECD's creditor reporting system database, classifying each record for the years
2006-2011 to estimate how much aid is given as cash, rather than as goods or
technical advice, and how much aid money is transferred to recipient countries,
rather than staying in the donor country.

The researchers found that while Italy reported giving about $2bn in bilateral
(country-to-country) aid in 2011, less than $300m was transferred to developing
countries.

In contrast, Denmark, which also reported giving about $2bn in bilateral aid,
transferred roughly $1.85bn to developing countries in the form of cash grants,
loans, project support or technical advice.

Less than 70% of French bilateral aid - and less than 50% of Austrian aid - was
transferred to developing countries in 2011.

Of the five countries that have met the UN target to spend 0.7% of their gross
national income (GNI) on aid, three - Sweden, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands -
transferred less than three-quarters of their aid money to developing countries
in 2011.

At least 8% of British bilateral aid was not transferred to developing countries
- a relatively low proportion compared with other donors.

The report doesn't examine which companies or consultants win contracts for
technical advice or other projects, which means the real figures on how much aid
stays in donor countries could be significantly higher. Last year, critics
pounced on the UK's Department for International Development (DfID) after the
Sunday Telegraph revealed just how lucrative the UK aid business has been for a
small group of primarily British consultants.

According to OECD rules, spending can qualify as aid if it has the promotion of
economic development and welfare in developing countries as its main objective
and is given either as a grant or a concessional loan. The list of specific
activities that can be counted as aid has expanded over time, however.

Donors can count cancelled or rescheduled debt as official aid even if no new
transfer of resources is involved, for example. The cost to donor countries of
supporting students and refugees can also be counted, along with administration
costs and funding for activities to increase public support and awareness of
development in donor countries.

Aid statistics therefore fail to reflect the resources that developing countries
receive, the report argues, making it difficult for poor countries to understand
exactly how much money is coming in from donors.

Researchers found, for example, that more than $5bn of aid supposedly given to
the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2011 was never transferred to the country.
Instead, most of this figure represented debt relief.

Using OECD statistics, Afghanistan, the Solomon Islands and Togo appear to have
similar levels of aid dependency, with aid worth 35%, 43% and 36% of GNI
respectively. But while Afghanistan receives at least a third of its aid in
cash, aid to the Solomon Islands is largely delivered as people and expertise,
researchers found.

In Togo, meanwhile, "the bulk of reported aid never gets anywhere near the
country," said the researchers.

Rob Tew, a researcher who contributed to the report, said it was critical to
unpick official statistics in order to better understand the importance of aid
from the perspective of developing countries.

"When you start looking at aid as this bundle of things you can also start
honing in on what, in particular, donors are good at," said Tew. "We need to put
under the microscope different parts of the aid bundle, rather than treating aid
as one big number."

The report, "All investments to end poverty: real money, real choices, real
lives", examined aid flows as part of an attempt to map all financial resources
available to developing countries. It also looked at developing country
governments' own spending, commercial flows such as foreign direct investment,
and private giving through remittances or non-governmental organisations.

The study calls for greater attention to data as the discussions on what should
succeed the MDGs progress, and notes that global poverty measures - which draw
on several data sources, including household surveys and national accounts - are
surprisingly unreliable given their importance in development debates. A quarter
of the total number of people in poverty in sub-Saharan Africa is derived from
surveys conducted before 2005, according to the report.

"Good data is essential to global efforts to end poverty," said the researchers.
"It is needed to assess the prevalence and location of poverty. It is needed to
inform decision-making, to quantify, allocate and track resources and to measure
the effectiveness of investments. And it is needed to empower people in whose
name resources are being spent to demand accountability."

Farewell to alms

LENGTH: 1023 words

DATELINE: Nepal


Nepal, Aug. 6 -- The question of whether foreign aid is working in Nepal appears
nonsensical to many, especially recipient and donor officials. If foreign aid is
not working, donors would have long stopped giving and we would have long
stopped receiving. However, foreign aid continues the world over and has been
continuing in Nepal for the last six and a half decades. Some government
publications even state that foreign aid has played a vital role in Nepal's
socio-economic development.

Additionally, all Finance Ministers, in their budget speeches, thank
donors-lately also known as development partners-without fail for their
continued assistance and express hope that their assistance will continue in the
days to come. Almost all donor documents assert that foreign aid to Nepal is
working. However, there are some of us, although we lack evidence-based proof,
who are not so sure about the workings of foreign aid. There is much debate on
what foreign aid is supposed to be. Is foreign aid supposed to be what makes the
difference between a country like Nepal, which is stuck in poverty, or one that
is powering ahead as an economic tiger like South Korea?

The answer to this perennial question seems to be 'sometimes'. Sometimes it
works, sometimes it doesn't. The challenges, as well as the need, for Nepali
policymakers, is to try and understand theories of foreign aid, especially
supplemental and displacement theories, to ensure that foreign aid can help
achieve socio-economic development in general and poverty alleviation in
particular.

First, key factors in the development process need to be identified. In the
Nepali context, the key factor has been savings. Because Nepal is a poor
country, it needs to spend a great portion of its income on
consumption-estimated to be 90.7 percent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in
the Fiscal Year (FY) 2012/13. As long as Nepal remains poor, it will be very
difficult for the country to set aside resources in the form of
savings-estimated to be 9.3 percent of the GDP in the FY 2012/13-to accumulate
capital. Investment, therefore, remains low, resulting in little to no growth.
For example, during the last Three-Year Plan, the economic growth rate averaged
at only four percent and was lower at 3.6 percent in the last FY.

Foreign aid, thus, can supplement savings and enable Nepal to maintain the level
of investment needed for economic growth. As the economy grows, Nepal can afford
to set aside an increasing portion of its income in the form of savings.
Eventually, it can reach a point where savings alone are sufficient to finance
the volume of investment needed to maintain the desired rate of growth without
foreign aid. Experts conclude, and international experience shows, that the
dependency on foreign aid needs to disappear. A country needs to become
independent 20 to 30 years since starting to receive foreign aid. In Nepal's
case, it has already been six and a half decades but there is no sign that we
will be self-reliant anytime soon. In this FY budget, proposed foreign aid will
finance 69.12 percent of capital expenditure and financing combined.

The supplemental theory of foreign aid therefore is not working in Nepal.
Instead, the displacement theory could work. Continued dependency on foreign aid
is frustrating our socio-economic development. Foreign aid is imposing alien
values and alien patterns of organisation and development. With such
impositions, coupled with a lack of clear policy, foreign aid is inhibiting the
emergence of a dynamic process of change in Nepal. When we continue to seek
foreign aid, there is less of a need to make our own efforts to raise revenue.
We never take effective decisions to raise taxes and mobilise domestic
resources. Foreign aid makes things easier and we avoid taking unpopular
decisions including

raising taxes and forging partnerships with the private sector (PPP).

So if foreign aid is not working, what is it doing? First, foreign aid comes to
the government, not to the people, and is spent on public sector projects with
low rates of return. Second, foreign aid also goes to the elite, concentrating
the benefits of development in the hands of the rich who use their income or
profits for conspicuous consumption. Additionally, most foreign aid is never in
line with our system. We have not been able to come up with a proper foreign aid
policy and the one we have has become outdated. Donors impose conditions causing
foreign aid to dictate our national development plans and more importantly, our
acts, rules and regulations. Most foreign aid does not go through our planning
and budgeting system; it hardly even goes through our monitoring and auditing
systems.

Aid is displacing our domestic development efforts in other ways as well. First,
we quickly agree to pick up and apply methods that have worked elsewhere but
might not work here. Second, foreign aid provides income to some educated
Nepalis, including bureaucrats and university teachers, who tend to work for
donors and not for the government, resulting in dysfunctional state
institutions. Third, foreign aid attempts to import different systems for
auditing, procurement and monitoring and reporting. This is why one ministry is
often required to undertake many reforms at a single time.

In this context, we will continue to become dependent on foreign aid unless we
change the way we mobilise, coordinate and manage aid. We need to learn from
other countries that were in similar situation but have managed to graduate
15-20 years after they started to receive aid. It is time for us to start
building things. We need to build them with our own people, with our own tools
and on our own time. Then, we can go to donors and ask them to fund what we have
built.

Ghimire is Joint Secretary at the Office of the Prime Minister and the Council
of Ministers and has more than two decades of experience in foreign aid
mobilisation and coordination

Special Eurobarometer survey on humanitarian aid: Europeans care - and endorse
the Commission's mandate

LENGTH: 1441  words

DATELINE: Brussels


Brussels, Aug. 05 -- European Commission has issued following Press Release:

A special Eurobarometer survey on humanitarian aid reveals a high level of
solidarity among EU citizens with victims of conflict and natural disasters
outside the Union. Eight out of ten citizens (79%) think it is important that
the EU funds humanitarian aid outside its borders. However, the financial and
economic crisis has taken its toll as the approval rate dropped 9% from 88% in
2006 when the last survey was carried out. There is a clear link between this
decrease and the individual financial situation of citizens; those who have
problems paying their bills expressed less support. At the same time, there is a
strong endorsement of the Commission's mandate to provide relief aid, undertaken
through its humanitarian aid and civil protection department (ECHO). An overall
majority of EU citizens (58%), and a relative majority in all Member States,
think that humanitarian aid is more efficient when provided by the EU through
the European Commission. Around one quarter (24%) would prefer that relief funds
be channelled through Member States.

The Special Eurobarometer 343 on Humanitarian Aid looked at four major issues:

(1) Importance of EU humanitarian aid activities for EU citizens

(2) Awareness of humanitarian aid and the actors in this domain

(3) Knowledge and information on EU humanitarian aid activities

(4) Common or national approach to humanitarian aid

In a nutshell:

*

Europe cares - eight out of ten EU citizens (79%) think that it is important
that the European Union funds humanitarian aid activities outside its borders.

*

EU citizens have a clear opinion on how humanitarian aid should be administered.
In every single Member State, a clear majority of EU citizens (58% on average)
think that humanitarian aid is more efficient if provided jointly by the Union
through the European Commission.

*

Citizens think that EU humanitarian aid is an important issue on which they
should be kept informed (86% do so), despite a perceived lack of knowledge about
such activities, as only 18% feel well informed.

*

18% of respondents spontaneously name the EU, the European Commission and/or its
Humanitarian Aid department (ECHO) as an humanitarian aid donor.

Main results

79% think it is important that the European Union (EU) funds humanitarian aid
outside its borders (88% in 2006/EU25).

This is a significant drop of 9% compared to the results in 20061, but is still
a very large majority in support of such action. A decrease in support can be
noted in all Member States with the exception of Cyprus where the approval rate
remained at the same high level (95%). Member States with the largest reduction
in support are Latvia (70% / -18%) and Lithuania (68% / -15%). In Belgium (71%),
Denmark (80%), Poland (79%), Romania (74%) and the UK (75%) support in all
countries dropped by 14%.

The financial and economic crisis has taken its toll: the personal financial
situation of those interviewed plays a role, with those regularly having
problems paying their bills expressing less support for EU funding of
humanitarian aid beyond the EU borders.

85% of EU citizens can name at least one organisation providing humanitarian aid
on the ground and 72% can name at least one organisation funding humanitarian
assistance.

The awareness for donor organisations is lower than for implementing ones.
However, even in countries with the lowest identification rate (the Baltic
States, Malta and Poland), a large proportion of the population is able to
identify one or more organisations involved in humanitarian aid.

The organisations widest known among EU citizens are the Red Cross and UNICEF.

18% spontaneously name the EU, the European Commission and/or the Commission's
Humanitarian Aid department (ECHO) as an actor funding humanitarian aid2. And
despite the fact that this is actually not the EU's role, 12% spontaneously name
the EU, the Commission and/or ECHO as a provider of humanitarian aid on the
ground.3 43% know that the EU funds humanitarian actions, when asked.4

This is a huge surge in spontaneous recognition for the EU. In 2006, when asked
a slightly different question5, just 7% proactively mentioned the EU.

When asked if they know that the EU, through the Commission and ECHO, funds
humanitarian actions outside its borders, 43% responded with 'yes', with
Luxembourg coming first (72%) and Belgium second (58%). The lowest percentage
rate was noted in Romania and non-EU member Iceland (both 28%).

86% think it is important to be informed about EU humanitarian aid activities
(87% in 2006/EU25).

18% feel they are well informed about humanitarian aid activities (22% in
2006/EU25 and 11% in 2001).

31% of respondents feel "not at all informed". A correlation between education
and knowledge should be noted: the less educated respondents are, the less
informed they feel.

58% think it is more efficient to provide humanitarian aid through the EU rather
than by each Member State separately (56% in 2006/EU25). 24% prefer Member State
option (26% in 2006/EU25). 5% favour neither one nor the other.

The strongest support for a common action is found in Cyprus (71%), Spain and
Portugal (both 68%), Belgium (66%), France (65%) as well as in Bulgaria,
Germany, Greece and The Netherlands (all 62%). Support for a common action below
50% is found in four Member States: Ireland and Romania (both 43% support),
Lithuania (46%) and the UK (49%).

In all EU Member States only a minority favours a national approach to
humanitarian aid, reaching the highest figure in the Czech Republic (33%),
Slovenia and the UK (both 32%). The lowest support for a national approach to
humanitarian aid is Portugal (12%), Bulgaria and Spain (both 16%).

Large positive shifts in the support for a common action can be noted in
Bulgaria and Spain (both +12%) and Cyprus (+11%), whereas a significant decrease
is reported in Greece (-9%) and Belgium (-8%).

The survey

Special Eurobarometer 343 on Humanitarian Aid was carried out in the 27 EU
Member States plus Iceland. 26,800 citizens were interviewed face-to-face
between February and March 2010 about their perception of humanitarian aid in
general and EU humanitarian aid in particular.

Special Eurobarometer 343 questions on Humanitarian Aid 2010

QB1. Can you name some organizations involved in providing humanitarian aid? By
providing aid, we mean that they provide on-the-ground support.

QB2. And now, can you name any organizations that are funding humanitarian aid?
By funding, we mean that they provide financial support to humanitarian aid.

QB3. Do you know that the European Union, through the European Commission and
its Humanitarian Aid Department (ECHO), funds humanitarian aid activities in
countries outside the European Union?

QB4. How well informed do you think you are about the European Union
humanitarian aid activities?

QB5. How important do you think it is that the European Union funds humanitarian
aid activities outside the European Union?

QB6. How important do you think it is that European citizens are informed about
humanitarian aid activities funded by the European Union, through the European
Commission and its Humanitarian Aid Department (ECHO)?

QB7. Would you say that humanitarian aid is more efficient if provided by each
Member State of the European Union separately or if it is provided by the
European Union through the European Commission?

The European Union as a humanitarian actor

The EU as a whole - European Commission plus Member States - is the world's
largest humanitarian aid donor, helping people in need across the globe. The
Commission alone spent on average nearly &#8364;800 million annually in the last
five years (&#8364;931.7m in 2009).

The Commission's humanitarian funds are channelled through its
Directorate-General for Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection (ECHO), which

It's easy to hear what you're missing

BYLINE: By Evangeline Mitchell STAFF WRITER

SECTION: BUSINESS

LENGTH: 893 words


If your hearing isn't as good as it used to be, you may be thinking about
getting a hearing aid.

Then again, there's a good chance you can't be bothered, even though you find
yourself cranking up the volume on the TV or asking a friend sitting next to you
to speak up. If so, you are not alone.

More often than not, people put off getting a hearing aid after they first
notice it's getting harder to hear, said East Bay audiologist Leigh Kjeldsen.
"People wait an average of seven years between knowing they have a problem with
hearing and doing something about it."

Why the wait?

"People don't know about the process and don't know where to begin," said
Kjeldsen, owner of Valley Audiology, which has offices in Concord and Walnut
Creek.

The first step is to get your hearing tested by a hearing professional. That's
followed by more evaluations to help determine what type of hearing aid would
best fit the patient's hearing needs.

Once a hearing aid is selected, there is a fitting, which involves adjusting the
device to best meet the patient's needs. Often, patients come back for further
adjustments after the initial fitting.

Although hearing aids can indeed make your life better by improving your ability
to hear, they are not cheap.

"People need to know there is a very wide range of cost per hearing aid, and
that all depends on the level of technology," said Robert Green, an audiologist
at Alta Bates Summit Medical Center.

Smaller, less visible hearing aids tend to cost more than larger ones, he said.

The cost of a high-quality analog hearing aid can range from $900 to $1,200, and
a digital aid can range from $1,300 to $3,000, according to the Mayo Clinic Web
site. And that's just for one.

"Some people need one, some people need two," depending on their hearing needs,
said Kjeldsen.

Digital hearing aids, which are programmed by a computer, allow for more
flexibility and fine-tuning so that they can be adjusted to the hearing
fluctuations of the user as well as different hearing environments.

"Hearing aids nowadays, I like to think of them as miniature computers. They are
programmed for each individual's hearing loss. ... It's not one size fits all.
... Once the hearing aid is programmed, it can be reprogrammed," said Green.

Requests for analog hearing aids are rare, said Kjeldsen.

"Just about all the hearing aids sold these days are digital," she said. "I
would say in the last five years, there have been incredible advances in what a
(digital) hearing aid can do."

Hearing aids may need to be replaced after several years to accommodate a
person's changing hearing needs. However, digital aids have more programming
flexibility to adapt to a person's changing hearing needs.

Medicare doesn't cover hearing aids.. That means people have to either buy one
as an out-of-pocket expense or have supplemental Medicare or insurance to help
foot the bill.

Financial assistance programs to help people buy hearing aids may be available
from nonprofit and government agencies.

Hearing loss affects more than 28 million Americans, including nearly 6 million
children.

With some baby boomers (those born from 1946 to 1964) now in their 60s, the
number of people with hearing loss is expected to nearly double by 2030,
according to the Hearing Loss Association of America.

The likelihood of losing hearing increases with age, with as many as one in
three people older than 65 having some kind of hearing loss, according to the
association.

Although 95 percent of Americans with hearing loss can be successfully treated
with hearing aids, only 22 percent (or 6.35 million individuals) use hearing
aids.

"Hearings aids are very expensive, so a lot of people are convinced they are not
going to get value for what the are paying. There is a lot of skepticism," said
Green.

In California, consumers can obtain hearing aids from three sources: hearing aid
specialists, dispensing audiologists or physicians licensed as a hearing aid
dispensers.

All three types have to be licensed and pass written and practical examinations
related to their field.

Audiologists are required to have at least a master's degree related to
audiology (an educational requirement that is in the process of being upgraded
to a doctoral level).

To become a licensed hearing aid specialist requires a high school degree and
work under the supervision of a licensed hearing aid dispenser for at least
three years.

When choosing a hearing aid dispenser, it's a good idea to get recommendations
from friends. Senior citizens might want to check with a local senior club.
Also, check with the local Better Business Bureau to see whether any complaints
have been filed.

Many hearing aid sales result from referrals made by primary care doctors or a
friend or family member who has come to Valley Audiology, said Kjeldsen.

But there are also times when a person with a hearing problem is brought in by a
spouse or child who will say, "She just can't hear anymore," said Green.

"What is at the heart of this whole process is whether or not the person (with
the hearing problem) is actually ready for (a hearing aid). She is the one who
is going to wear it. She is the one who has to make the decision. ... It's not
something people are kind of excited about, but for a lot of people it's a
necessity."

Price of Success In AIDS Treatment;
Hospitals Confront New Therapy

BYLINE:  By MILT FREUDENHEIM

SECTION: Section C; Column 2; Business/Financial Desk; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 2013 words


The 20-year onslaught of AIDS has radically changed the economics of patient
care, and its effects are still being felt throughout the health care system.

In the first years, when AIDS patients generally needed prolonged bed care and
little could be done to keep them alive, hospitals across the country scrambled
for resources to treat them.

Now many AIDS patients are much healthier, as long as they adhere to complicated
drug regimens. They are less likely to be admitted as hospital inpatients, but
their treatments require fine-tuning and monitoring, in outpatient clinics and
the offices of primary care doctors.

That care also requires extensive services and expertise on the part of
hospitals and doctors. But unfortunately for hospitals, money to pay for the
expensive new treatments has not always followed the patients from the inpatient
floors to the clinics. Some hospitals are reporting heavy losses on outpatient
care for H.I.V. and AIDS patients today, particularly as the disease has spread
beyond an affliction primarily among gay men to attack more low-income people
who are without insurance, including heterosexual intravenous drug users and
their spouses.

Many family physicians and internists have been significantly affected by the
sweep of AIDS as well. In the early days, they were often reimbursed by
indemnity insurance plans that covered all services when they cared for AIDS
patients.

Now, although they often find themselves spending as much or more time with
patients who are controlling their AIDS with complicated drug regimens, health
maintenance organizations often pay a flat fee for physicians' services,
classifying AIDS as routine general care.

AIDS has been anything but routine for patients and the health care system,
however. From the first handful of cases in 1981 in California and New York that
were later found to be AIDS-related pneumonia, the epidemic surged to a peak of
249,000 patient stays in 1995 in hospitals across the country, according to the
federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

In the early years, hospitals that treated many patients with the disease rushed
to assemble AIDS units.

At San Francisco General Hospital, 60 of the 300 medical-surgical beds were
dedicated to AIDS patients in 1993 and 1994. In Miami, AIDS patients occupied 45
of 380 beds at Mercy Hospital. There were 40 beds for AIDS patients in Bellevue
in New York, and almost half the 220 beds in St. Clare's Hospital were allocated
to AIDS patients.

"It was not unusual to have maybe 100 inpatients out of a census in the hospital
of 220," said Sister Pascal Conforti, a member of the Ursuline order who is a
staff chaplain at St. Clare's.

Although hundreds of hospitals treat some AIDS patients, much of the activity
was concentrated in a few. Five percent of the nation's hospitals were treating
55 percent of all AIDS patients in the mid-1990's. Public hospitals like
Bellevue have been among the largest providers of care for H.I.V. and AIDS
patients, including many poor residents. For example, 50 percent of the H.I.V.
patients in Dallas County have been getting their care in the public Parkland
Health and Hospital System.

In cities particularly hard hit, hospitals transferred nurses and resident
physicians to AIDS duty from other units, especially cancer floors.

At first, the course of the disease was often extraordinarily swift.

"They would say, 'I get a little short of breath going up subway steps,' "
recalled Dr. Victoria Sharp, who arrived at St. Clare's in 1989. "Three weeks
later, they were dead.

"I was feeling like I was standing there with my arms open and just catching
people as they came into the emergency room," added Dr. Sharp, now director of
the H.I.V. center at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. "It was truly
horrific."

Dr. Paul Volberding, a San Francisco oncologist whose first patient, in July
1981, was "a young man with Kaposi's sarcoma," the virulent AIDS-related skin
cancer, remembers that era as extraordinarily painful. "Deaths were absolutely
routine," he said.

In addition to the sheer logistical challenge, hospitals had to contend with the
stigma associated with AIDS and the fears of contagion from the strange new
illness, even among hospital staff.

"It was a time when other people were not supportive,' Dr. Sharp said. "Dietary
services, other specialties. There was a lot of fear, a lot of discrimination.
It's amazing how far we've come."

Even as they raced to keep up with the patient flow, some hospitals tried to
play down their AIDS services for fear of losing prospective patients with other
diseases. Paula Sparti, a Miami family physician, said she was rebuffed in the
1980's when she applied for a salaried post at South Miami Hospital, where she
had treated dozens of her AIDS patients. "They didn't want to be known as an
AIDS hospital," she said.

And in at least one case, in 1991, a federal appeals court in New Orleans upheld
a health plan that had singled out AIDS for special restrictions on coverage.

But concerns about finances took a back seat, for the most part, in the early
years of the epidemic.

Many of the early AIDS patients were young, white, homosexual men whose
insurance paid for almost every test and medical service, with few questions
asked.

"In the first decade, we had a lot of gay men with indemnity insurance," said
Shedrick J. Boren, director of special immunology services at Mercy Hospital in
the Coconut Grove section of Miami. "They were financially profitable for the
hospitals," he said.

The Columbia Healthcare Corporation, the national hospital chain, saw AIDS
treatment as such a lucrative business opportunity that it moved the big AIDS
practice of Dr. Sparti and her partners into Columbia's Deering Hospital in
Miami in 1992.

"In exchange for getting our admissions to the hospital, they were willing to
put in a state-of-the-art H.I.V. unit" with full-time, dedicated H.I.V. nurses,
said Dr. Michael Wohlfeiler, an internist in the South Beach section of Miami
Beach who was one of Dr. Sparti's partners.

The economics began to change in the mid-1990's as the first AIDS drug cocktails
revolutionized treatment. As the drugs gave many patients their lives back, but
left them on complicated treatment regimens, hospitals found themselves facing
the loss of a major revenue source but still needing to treat the same patients
in outpatient clinics.

The average hospital stay for H.I.V. and AIDS patients in the state of New York,
which keeps the most complete records on AIDS care in the country, was 23.4 days
in 1983, almost two weeks longer than the 9.6-day average stay in 1999,
according to a forthcoming report by the state health department.

Insurance companies and major employers who were faced with heavy costs for AIDS
and other medical care began switching workers to managed care plans. And
insurance companies started paying a flat fee for each day a patient was in the
hospital or a case rate depending on the diagnosis. Hospitals could no longer
bill for each service, no matter how necessary, and administrators pushed for
quicker discharges.

Doctors treating AIDS now say they are often strained financially. Dr. Michael
Somero, an internist in Palm Springs, Calif., who treats several hundred H.I.V.
patients, canceled his contract with a local managed care medical group last
August. The health plans were paying a flat monthly fee of $50 or $60 for each
member to the medical group, which turned over $12 to the doctor. "That was a
ridiculous amount for any patient, H.I.V. or not," said Nancy Green, Dr.
Somero's office manager.

Ben Singer, a spokesman for Pacifcare Health Systems, one of the H.M.O's with
contracts in Palm Springs, said that for doctors with "a disproportionate number
of H.I.V. patients, the insurance system, as designed, is challenged."

But he added: "The solution doesn't lie with any one H.M.O. or insurer" but with
the willingness of society to continue financing care for AIDS at a cost doctors
can live with.

Dr. Wohlfeiler in Miami said that H.I.V. patients require more time, they have
more questions and more side effects to discuss. "In the eyes of the insurance
company, we're just primary care physicians," he said. By 1997, Columbia-HCA
Healthcare, as the chain was renamed, decided to end its contracts with the
group of AIDS doctors in Miami. "Once they don't make the money they think they
are going to make, the issues change," Dr. Wohlfeiler said. Jeff Prescott, a
spokesman for HCA Healthcare, the company's current name, confirmed that
Columbia had been "in a mode to get out of those contracts" as it retreated from
deals with various types of doctors.

After H.I.V.-related hospital admissions plummeted 29 percent from 1995 to 1997,
to 178,000 from 249,000, hospitals took even more drastic steps, closing their
inpatient AIDS units or changing them over to treat contagious diseases of all
kinds. Nurses and physicians were shifted to walk-in clinics for H.I.V.-related
illnesses and to other parts of the hospital.

Mercy Hospital closed its inpatient AIDS unit in 1998 and dispersed the reduced
numbers of patients around the hospital. Traffic at the hospital's outpatient
AIDS clinic and the pharmacy that dispensed the drugs grew, meanwhile, and
H.I.V.-related visits to outpatient clinics quintupled to 4,800 a year. Many of
those patients were low-income intravenous drug users without insurance,
money-losers for Mercy and other hospitals.

"AIDS services have gone from being a profit center to being a loss center," Mr.
Boren said. His unit reported a $400,000 loss in 2000.

Dr. Sharp at St. Luke's-Roosevelt said, "The change was wonderful news for
patients but very bad news for institutions." She said reimbursement for her
hospital dropped substantially from 1995 to 2000, costing St. Luke's-Roosevelt
more than $1.7 million a year as inpatient admissions dropped by 600, to 1,800 a
year, and outpatient visits soared to 47,000 from 4,500.

She said that the hospitals received $10,000 a year, on average, for AIDS
-related inpatients. Outpatient payments, amounting to about $100 a visit, did
not make up for the loss of revenue. In New York and California, generous
financing for AIDS programs fills the gap for hospitals. But in Texas, Parkland,
for example, has a big deficit for AIDS cases, according to Dr. Ron J. Anderson,
its chief executive.

St. Clare's, the first of 20 comprehensive H.I.V. centers to be designated and
supported financially by New York State and New York City health officials, was
pushed close to the edge by the rapid influx and even more rapid outflow of AIDS
patients. In just five years, the hospital shrank from 220 beds with 110
patients with AIDS-related illnesses to 110 beds with only 15 or so occupied by
AIDS-related patients.

In the peak inpatient years, "We were a huge part of the business of that
hospital: $35 million of $52 million in revenues," Dr. Sharp said.

George Lowe, director of the out-patient Spellman Center for H.I.V.-related
Disease, said the switch hit St. Clare's particularly hard. "The hospital has
been knocked to its knees," he said. "There was even talk of changing the name
because we had been known so many years as an AIDS hospital."

With a federal loan to tide it over during three years of renovating, Saint
Clare's continued to run the Spellman H.I.V. center and other out-patient
services. Now it is marketing the hospital as "the new St. Clare's," Mr. Lowe
said, a general community hospital with all new facilities: emergency room,
operating rooms, intensive care unit, cardiac care unit, and plans for a new
pediatric program.

BILL GATES, WIFE GIVE $25 MILLION / TO HELP DEVELOP AN AIDS VACCINE

BYLINE: Huntly Collins, INQUIRER STAFF WRITER

SECTION: NATIONAL; Pg. A01

LENGTH: 604 words


Computer software magnate Bill Gates has given $25 million to AIDS vaccine
research, the largest private donation for AIDS research ever.

The gift, announced yesterday, went to the International AIDS Vaccine
Initiative, a private, nonprofit group based in New York.

The initiative aims to spur development of an AIDS vaccine that would be
effective and affordable in poor countries of Africa and Asia, where the AIDS
epidemic is taking its greatest toll.

Last year, 2.5 million people worldwide died of AIDS, and 5.8 million became
infected with the AIDS virus. More than 95 percent of those infected live in
developing countries.

In a statement, Gates, the founder and chairman of Microsoft Corp., said he and
his wife, Melinda, wanted all children to grow up in a world without AIDS.

"Vaccines are one of the most far-reaching technologies of our time," Gates
said. "A widely distributed vaccine can make the goal of a world without AIDS a
reality."

The gift, from the William H. Gates Foundation, is in addition to a $100 million
donation the couple made last year to another organization to spur delivery of
new and existing vaccines to children in poor countries.

Wayne Koff, head of research at the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, said
the $25 million, to be given over five years, will be used to finance work on
three new AIDS vaccine candidates between now and 2001.

"We are canvassing the globe for the best scientific opportunities," Koff said.

Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases, hailed the gift as an example of the public-private "synergy" needed
to develop an AIDS vaccine.

"You are not going to be able to buy an AIDS vaccine tomorrow, but you can seed
the scientific work that will make a vaccine possible in the future," Fauci
said.

Currently, the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative is providing about $9
million to finance work on two experimental AIDS vaccines that are expected to
be tested in humans shortly.

The vaccines aim to prevent infection with the human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV), which causes AIDS, a goal that has eluded scientists for more than 15
years.

The federal government is spending more than $200 million on AIDS vaccine
research in the current fiscal year.

Although government scientists say several AIDS vaccine candidates look
promising, none has yet advanced to large-scale human field trials.

The AIDS Vaccine Initiative, launched in 1996 with money from the Rockefeller
Foundation, hopes to use private funds to put AIDS vaccine development on the
fast-track.

It has instituted an incentive system to assure that any successful AIDS
vaccines will be affordable to Third World countries.

Under the arrangement, the private group puts up the initial seed money to
develop an AIDS vaccine.

In exchange, biotechnology companies or university scientists who are awarded
development grants must agree to sell any successful vaccine to Third World
countries at a price that does not exceed 10 percent of actual production costs.

That is the key provision in the two agreements that the AIDS Vaccine Initiative
has hammered out for its current projects.

One vaccine is being developed at Oxford University in collaboration with Kenyan
scientists. The other is under development at the University of North Carolina,
which is collaborating with South Africa.

Both projects use genetic engineering to deliver several HIV genes into human
cells. The hope is that they will prime the immune system to effectively combat
any actual infection with HIV later on.

AIDS PROTESTERS SAY RITE AID LACKS SOME DRUGS / MISSED DOSES COULD INTERFERE
WITH PATIENTS' HEALTH. THE CHAIN SAID IT KEPT ITS STOCKS UP TO DATE.

BYLINE: Huntly Collins, INQUIRER STAFF WRITER

SECTION: CITY & REGION; Pg. B02

LENGTH: 531 words


AIDS activists charged yesterday that at least two dozen Rite Aid stores in the
Philadelphia area did not have on hand some medications that are key to treating
people infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

"Rite Aid makes billions of dollars every year but claims to be unable to stock
the medication I need to stay alive," said Joe West, a Southwest Philadelphia
resident who was diagnosed with HIV two years ago.

The allegations, made during a noontime protest by more than 100 demonstrators
at North Broad Street and Cecil B. Moore Avenue, are the latest skirmish in an
ongoing battle between Rite Aid and the AIDS activist group ACTUP.

Suzanne Mead, a vice president of the Harrisburg-based drugstore chain, said
that Rite Aid "actively monitors" its drug inventories and keeps them up to
date.

But she said there may be "an occasion" when a particular medication is not
immediately available. In that case, the pharmacist gets it from another Rite
Aid store or from a supplier as soon as possible, she said.

The activists said that an informal telephone survey of 40 Rite Aid stores in
Philadelphia, conducted earlier this week, found that 24 did not have at least
one important anti-HIV drug in stock.

The unavailable drugs included two in a new class known as protease inhibitors,
which, when combined with older AIDS medications, have reduced AIDS mortality
rates by as much as 50 percent over the last two years.

In order to be effective, the drugs must be taken several times each day, with
no interruptions. If there are breaks in treatment, the AIDS virus has an
opportunity to mutate into strains that can resist the drugs.

Julie Davids, an ACTUP member, said the stores reported that they could obtain
the drugs but indicated it would take a day or more to get them in stock. Such
delays, Davids said, can greatly compromise treatment effectiveness.

The activists, including many infected with HIV, called on Rite Aid to stock all
FDA-approved AIDS medications. They also said the drugstore chain needed to iron
out billing problems that plagued some patients covered under the state's new
Medicaid managed-care program. And they called on Rite Aid to improve training
for pharmacists and pharmacy technicians.

As the activists protested, Rite Aid was putting its pharmacists in the
Philadelphia area through a daylong training course on HIV and the complicated
drug regimens that patients are now being prescribed.

Over three days, Rite Aid will train more than 400 pharmacists, Mead said. The
new, mandatory program was established after earlier protests by AIDS activists.

"We are confident that our pharmacists are as knowledgeable, if not more so,
than others in the Philadelphia area," Mead said.

She said the Rite Aid chain had recently established a 24-hour hotline in
Philadelphia where its pharmacists could get advice on AIDS drugs. The chain has
also set up a computerized system aimed at easing the billing problems patients
have experienced, she said.

Rite Aid also has agreed to provide a 72-hour supply of drugs to AIDS patients
whose insurance or other coverage cannot be immediately verified, Mead said.

Racial rifts emerge as AIDS shifts

BYLINE: LISA FREDERICK

SECTION: NATIONAL; Editor's Choice; Pg. 1A

LENGTH: 1773 words

DATELINE: TAMPA



Carl DeVine's words become slow and agonized when he talks about two of the
friends he lost to AIDS last year.

His friends, Gwen Jenkins and Anthony Hayward, founded the People of Color  AIDS
Coalition four years ago with the goal of educating black people about  the
disease and improving the services offered to minority AIDS patients.

Based in two drafty, old converted homes in south St. Petersburg, it's an
organization DeVine is fighting hard to keep afloat after its founders'  deaths.

He is battling meager financing and the nagging feeling that the odds are
stacked against him.

"I'm tired of seeing my friends die. I'm tired of seeing my relatives  die,"
DeVine says, his voice suddenly gaining strength and speed. "I'm tired  of
knowing that so many more of us are going to die because of greed and
selfishness and insensitivity."

DeVine is not alone in his frustration. Several people who work with  agencies
that provide AIDS education and patient services in the black  community say
they aren't getting their fair share of AIDS funding.

"Black organizations are collectively concerned that, as in so many other
things, we are being shut out of the process," says Walter Niles, a health
specialist with the Tampa Urban League.

It's a scenario that has played out in other cities nationwide, often  bitterly
and always emotionally, as the tug of war for dollars has turned  allies
fighting a common battle into fierce rivals.

The rifts are the result of the changing demographics of the disease.

A decade ago, AIDS primarily affected gay and bisexual men, so most AIDS
organizations, and the money that supported them, were focused on those  groups.

Today, however, the rate of new HIV infections is highest among  heterosexual,
intravenous drug users and their sexual partners, many of whom  are minorities.

Yet, critics say, most AIDS programs are still being administered with gay
white men in mind.

Perhaps the most acrimonious example of the developing schism over AIDS  money
took place in Washington, D.C., last year.

The chief of the district's Agency for HIV/AIDS, a white lesbian, was fired
after an internal investigation concluded she had improperly attempted to  steer
money away from a clinic that has ties to the Nation of Islam, a black
religious sect.

   The incident caused already simmering tensions regarding AIDS funding to
boil over in that city.

Locally, activists such as DeVine will tell you there is no all-out "war"  over
money here.

But there soon could be unless something concrete comes from the emerging
dialogue and the new strategies recently created to address the problem.

Which agencies get what

   Most of the initiatives are being spearheaded by the Suncoast AIDS Network,
the agency that coordinates health care and services for people with AIDS in a
multicounty area that includes Hillsborough and Pinellas.

A review board of SCAN officials ranks programs to decide which should get
federal and state money. The board decides, for example, how much money needs
to be set aside for pediatric AIDS cases or other specific populations.

Once organizations apply for federal dollars through SCAN, a review board  of
local officials and AIDS experts - none affiliated with SCAN - evaluates  the
applications and decides which will be financed.

Because of concerns expressed by DeVine and others, SCAN recently created a
Minority Affairs Committee, and this year tentatively has earmarked $ 163,000
for minority-run AIDS programs.

"We did not want the funding sources to pit us against each other," said  Olga
Williams, a member of the Minority Affairs Committee and services  director for
the Family Enrichment Center.

Black officials concerned about AIDS financing disparities don't point to
discrimination as the only cause for their financial difficulties. They  concede
that other organizations have an advantage simply because they've been  around a
lot longer.

It's hard for all private, non-profit organizations, including minority  ones,
to get established. In order to get grants, you already have to have  something
in the pot, Williams said.

"People tend to give money to organizations that already have money,"  Williams
said. "It's just like when you go for a job and they won't hire you  because you
don't have any experience, yet how do you get the experience if  people won't
hire you?"

The Family Enrichment Center on N 40th Street might be the best known of
Hillsborough's black-run AIDS organizations.

There aren't too many others, and as the number of AIDS cases continues to
climb dramatically in the black community, the need to create and nurture more
is imperative, AIDS activists agree.

The National Commission on AIDS reported last year that racial and ethnic
factors play a big role in the nation's AIDS epidemic.

Almost half of the people in America with AIDS are black or Hispanic, the
commission said.

"As a nation, we have no choice but to take account of race if we are to  alter
the epidemic," the commission reported.

As of January, there were 2,203 reported AIDS cases in Hillsborough County.
Twenty-five percent, or 549, were black. Blacks account for 12 percent of
Hillsborough's population.

Officials say part of the reason for the disproportionate numbers is that  AIDS
education still has trouble reaching some black neighborhoods.

"The black community is 13 years behind the white community when it comes  to
AIDS awareness," DeVine said. His organization recently surveyed black
communities and found that 21 percent of the respondents said Christians don't
get AIDS.

Some think such outdated ideas may be because black leaders and the black
community as a whole were slow to recognize the AIDS crisis.

But black AIDS activists bristle at suggestions that any initial resistance  to
confronting the disease justifies the problems they now have in getting  money
for their programs.

"When I have to write the grant, then clean the toilet, then help a client  . .
.," DeVine's voice trails off. "The process is wrong and it was designed  to
keep us out."

Different views of the same problem

   Others suggest there might be something besides race complicating the issue
of AIDS money. Perhaps black agencies aren't getting their due because AIDS
activists as a whole are afraid of fragmenting themselves.

When AIDS first came to public attention more than a decade ago, the gay  white
men who were its primary victims rallied in the face of the crisis. Much  of the
public awareness about the disease is due in large part to their  efforts.

That may explain why SCAN meetings can be very emotional. Some AIDS  patients
cling to the way things were, afraid of being shoved to the side.

"There are people in those meetings who are dying or have watched a lot of
friends die," Williams says. "They don't want to be forgotten."

Whether it's institutional discrimination or fervent emotion, one thing is
certain: Officials of both races agree there is a problem.

"Discrimination was there before the AIDS epidemic," said Steven  Kindland,
spokesman for the state Department of Health and Rehabilitative  Services' AIDS
programs. "In no way do we deny that these problems exist."

While it may be intolerable, discrimination usually isn't fatal. Except  when it
comes to AIDS money.

"It means we have to try even harder here," says Chuck Kuehn, executive
director of the Tampa AIDS Network and president of SCAN's board of directors.
"Discrimination in this means people will die sooner."

Kuehn says SCAN has tried to prevent the infighting over money that has  torn
apart AIDS organizations in other cities.

He also thinks that the outspoken DeVine has a much harsher view of the
situation than other African-Americans who work with AIDS programs.

"I think that in general this community is working very well together,"  Kuehn
said.

The Tampa AIDS Network has had a black and a Hispanic resource worker on  staff
for some time now, and Kuehn estimates that 30 percent of the agency's  clients
are black.

The organization recently opened an office in the heart of Tampa, at 29th
Street and 29th Avenue, partly to better serve those clients.

It would seem that black activists would applaud the network's satellite
office, but many have mixed feelings about it.

They applaud the agency's commitment to providing AIDS services to  everyone,
but find it galling that worthy black organizations haven't been  able to do the
same thing because of money problems.

"TAN is doing a lot of what we should be doing," says the Rev. Elliott  Johnson,
who ran an AIDS education program called Project Save, Project Hope  in Tampa's
public housing complexes. His three-year $ 600,000 federal grant ran  out last
summer.

"We've got a personal interest here. These are my children," he says,  opening a
scrapbook of pictures and mementos from the project.

DeVine says the Tampa AIDS Network's presence in the heart of a black
neighborhood symbolizes the paternalistic "I know what's best for you"  attitude
many well-meaning white people have traditionally shown toward black  people.

"We aren't allowed to figure out what's best for us," he said.

Kuehn says criticism about TAN's efforts in Tampa's inner city isn't  justified.

"We waited for many years for the African-American community to take
responsibility for AIDS in the African-American community. Then we couldn't
wait any longer," Kuehn said. "That's why TAN is present in the
African-American community."

Black officials counter that it just makes sense that they should be the  ones
to design and carry out AIDS programs in black neighborhoods.

"Generally, people are more comfortable getting information from people  who
look most like them," Niles, of the Tampa Urban League, says.

Black heterosexuals who contract the disease through unprotected sex or
intravenous drug use may not be comfortable going to agencies they associate
with gay white men, DeVine said.

Clients, many of them drug users, quietly venture into Rainbow House, the
headquarters of People of Color AIDS Coalition, at all hours of the day for
advice and information. DeVine seeks them out in the dark corners and  alleyways
where illegal drugs are sold and used.

"We can go where the white agencies cannot," he said. "It's time for us  to be
our own role models."  Source: HRS HIV / STD / TB Program

Number of AIDS cases rises 40%

BYLINE: DIANE RADO

SECTION: TAMPA BAY AND STATE; Pg. 1B

LENGTH: 1050 words

DATELINE: TALLAHASSEE



The latest figures on AIDS in Florida show a nearly 40 percent jump in cases
since last year, a bleak trend for women, blacks and heterosexuals, and bad
news for babies.

Compared with national figures, Florida has greater percentages of females  and
blacks with acquired immune deficiency syndrome and a greater percentage  of
cases transmitted through heterosexual contact.

Also, the state is second only to New York in the number of pediatric AIDS
cases, according to June 1 figures from the state Department of Health and
Rehabilitative Services.

  Dr. Charles Mahan, Florida's outspoken state health officer, is worried  - and
disgusted.

  He criticized what he described as "the juvenile way Americans deal  with
tough sexual problems." He said Florida and the nation need to get  serious and
pour more money and thought into fighting the AIDS battle.

  Mahan said Friday he is going to sit down this weekend and write a  letter of
apology to Miss America.

  Leanza Cornett, a former Miss Florida, has been promoting AIDS awareness
during her reign as Miss America. But she was surprised earlier this month  when
Bradford County school officials told her she couldn't mention AIDS or  discuss
sex when she visited three elementary schools there.

  "I'm going to say, unfortunately, that's the way things are in some  parts of
Florida," Mahan said.

The newest AIDS figures show that 30,758 cases have been reported statewide
since Florida reported its first case in 1981.

That puts Florida in third place in the nation for AIDS cases. As of March  31,
New York was No. 1 with 55,154 reported cases, and California was No. 2  with
53,851 reported cases, according to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in Atlanta.

Florida has seen a steep rise in reported cases. In the year that ended May  1,
1993, AIDS cases jumped 38.7 percent, according to HRS.

Part of that increase can be attributed to an expanded definition of AIDS  that
went into effect in January, said Stephen Kindland, public information
coordinator for the HRS AIDS Program Office.

The expanded definition involved adding more diseases to a list of  illnesses
that can be related to AIDS.

AIDS officials were expecting even worse news. "With the changed  definition in
January, we were expecting a 100 to 150 percent increase in AIDS  cases," said
Steve Bardy, assistant AIDS coordinator for the Pasco-Pinellas  HRS district.

  Bardy said female AIDS cases in Pinellas more closely mirror national
percentages. Of the 1,371 reported AIDS cases in Pinellas, 135 were females,  or
about 10 percent. A larger statewide percentage probably can be attributed  to
pockets of the state that have higher numbers of female and heterosexual  AIDS
cases, Bardy said.

  About 11 percent of national AIDS cases are females, compared with 17  percent
in Florida. The percentage of AIDS cases transmitted through  heterosexual
contact is 7 percent in the nation, but 18 percent in Florida.

  The number of female and heterosexual cases has been rising steadily in
Florida for years, Kindland said.

  Five years ago, 13 percent of the total AIDS cases in Florida were  females,
compared with 17 percent now; and 14 percent of the cases were the  result of
heterosexual contact, compared with 18 percent now.

  Part of the problem is that women still aren't insisting that a condom  be
used during sex, Kindland said.

Also, there seems to be a lack of communication between sexual partners,  Mahan
said.

  Seventy percent of the people who have consented to interviews at public
health departments "don't even know their partner has an HIV infection,"   Mahan
said. "Women are always the last to know that they are infected." HIV,  the
human immunodeficiency virus, causes AIDS.

   In Florida as well as New York, AIDS rapidly is becoming a heterosexual
epidemic, he said. In California, AIDS is still largely confined to the
homosexual population, probably because that state has larger numbers of gay
men.

  The number of pediatric cases in Florida is linked to the female AIDS  cases,
Mahan said, because infants generally are infected by their mothers.

  Florida has 714 pediatric cases, according to the most recent figures.  New
York has the highest number - 1,192 pediatric cases as of March 31.

  A racial breakdown of AIDS cases also shows Florida with a higher  percentage
of cases affecting blacks. The percentage of black AIDS cases in  the nation is
30 percent; in Florida, the number is 40 percent.

  Mahan said Florida is failing to get the message across on AIDS.

  "I'm really worried that the kind of public health and media education  we've
been doing hasn't been effective, and we're missing the boat," Mahan  said.

  He said he'd like to see money go to psychology and anthropology  departments
at universities to study ways to change sexual behavior.

  "People know the facts of AIDS," Mahan said, "but they aren't  changing their
behavior."  The facts on AIDS

The latest AIDS figures show a bleak picture for women and minorities in
Florida compared with national numbers. The state has a greater percentage of
AIDS cases among females and blacks and a larger percentage of cases
transmitted through heterosexual contact.

CONSULT DOCTOR BEFORE BUYING HEARING AID

SECTION: DOLLARS/SENSE; Pg. 5D

LENGTH: 788 words


MORE THAN 8 PERCENT of Americans have some type of hearing loss, and many of
them wear some type of hearing aid.  The Better Business Bureau has received
complaints about some hearing-aid dispensers who sell their products to people
with a hearing problem that they know cannot be helped by the device.  The first
thing to do when you suspect that you have a hearing loss is to consult your
family physician. Your doctor may give you a referral to an ear specialist, a
physician who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of hearing problems.
That physician may then refer you to a hearing-aid specialist, who will test
your hearing, demonstrate various types of aids and help you select one.  Then
the specialist will take an impression of your ear for a mold to make an aid
that will fit well.  After you receive your hearing aid, the specialist will
assist you in getting used to it and in making any changes or repairs needed.
In most states, licensing regulations establish the qualifications and standards
for hearing-aid specialists. To find out if a specialist is licensed in
Missouri, write to: Council of Hearing Aid Dealers and Fitters, P.O. Box 1335,
Jefferson City, Mo. 65102.  In Illinois, you can write to: Illinois Department
of Public Health, Hearing Aid Program, 533 West Jefferson, Springfield, Ill.
62761.  At the time of your first visit to a doctor, you may be referred to a
clinical audiologist, who is trained to measure hearing loss and help
rehabilitate and counsel those with hearing problems. The same state agencies
can tell you if a clinical audiologist is licensed.  Another resource available
in many areas is a speech and hearing center associated with a hospital or
university. These centers offer a wide range of services, which may include an
examination, hearing test and a hearing-aid evaluation.  Remember that a medical
evaluation of your hearing is a necessary first step before buying a hearing
aid.  What do hearing-aid dispensers do?  All hearing-aid specialists, as well
as some medical ear specialists and clinical audiologists, sell and service
hearing aids. The dispenser plays an important role in the satisfaction you will
receive from your hearing aid.  U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulations
specify that a dispenser: Cannot sell you a hearing aid unless you have a
physician's statement that your hearing loss has been medically evaluated and
that you may be considered a candidate for a hearing aid.  May sell a hearing
aid to someone age 18 or older who has waived the medical evaluation, provided
the dispenser has informed the person that the waiver is not in his or her best
interest, has not actively encouraged the waiver and has provided the person
with an opportunity to sign a written statement of waiver.  Must provide the
prospective buyer with a user instructional brochure before selling a hearing
aid and must review it with the buyer.  No ethical dispenser would sell a
hearing aid to a person with a hearing problem that the dispenser knows cannot
be helped by the hearing aid.  However, the BBB has received a complaint against
one dispenser who allegedly sold someone hearing aids over a 10-year period,
costing more than $12,000, although the customer had been diagnosed as having a
90-percent hearing loss that no hearing aid could correct. The dispenser had
been selling the customer supposed new technologies that would restore hearing,
the BBB was told.  How can a consumer avoid rip-offs?  Before buying a hearing
aid, call the BBB in St. Louis, 531-3300, and ask for the dispenser's
customer-experience record.  Write to the appropriate state agency to find out
if the dispenser is a licensed hearing-aid specialist.  Ask the dispenser for
references, and call them.  Find out how you can get in touch with the dispenser
if you have any problems with your hearing aid. Ask if you can go to a local
office instead of having to go through a telephone answering service before you
can get help.  Evaluate the answers you receive to these questions: How long has
the dispenser been in business?  Does the dispenser have an established office?
Does the dispenser stand behind the product, clearly spelling out a warranty or
guarantee?  Can the dispenser provide rapid and efficient service if needed?
Remember that reputable dispensers do not use unfair selling practices, like
bait advertising and high-pressure sales tactics. They do not advertise that
their hearing aids ''operate on a new scientific principle'' unless they have
proof of that claim.  Also, reputable dispensers do not advertise that their
hearing aids can ''cure your hearing loss.'' If in doubt about the dispenser's
reputation, investigate before you buy.

San Francisco's long-term AIDS battle plans;
ACT UP leaps into action

BYLINE: Craig Wilson

SECTION: LIFE; Pg. 4D

LENGTH: 516 words


San Francisco is the focus of the AIDS world this week, as the Sixth
International Conference on AIDS comes to the U.S. city hardest hit by the
epidemic.

Today, in the final day of our series, we look at educators and activists who
are working toward a future when AIDS will loosen its grip on this city.

On Thursday, Friday and Monday, we'll report on the conference, which opens
today.  (Conference news, 1D; AIDS discrimination, 10A.)

 ACT UP, the activist group mainly of gay men and lesbians, is not going to take
the International AIDS Conference sitting down. Then again, maybe it will.

ACT UP (Aids Coalition to Unleash Power) has become more vocal, and
demonstrative, in attempts to speed the cure for AIDS.  ACT UP won't let up.

''Most groups deal with AIDS on a direct support-group level, which is
important,'' says Gene Nevins, a member of ACT UP in San Francisco. ''But very
few are trying to deal with the political issues and confront those
organizations, systems and individuals preventing the epidemic from being
defeated.''...

''It's our obligation to let people know the epidemic is still here,'' says ACT
UP's Ron Bracamonte. ''We have to confront the system. It's a daily struggle for
us to keep the epidemic in people's minds. If people forget it, politicians will
forget it, and then there will be no money. ...  We're making things so they're
not so comfortable.''

''Lives will be saved not by what's happening inside the conference,'' adds Deeg
Gold, ''but outside the conference.''

So what's ACT UP have in store this week?

- Today: The International AIDS Conference Civil Disobedience near the Moscone
Center.  ''We want to focus on the needs of people with AIDS, which is not the
focus of the conference,'' Gold says. ''We want to humanize the conference.
We're still trying to get new medication out. This far into the epidemic, it
just shouldn't be.''

- Thursday: ACT UP will take its ''Cure the System Too'' protest to city hall
and the federal buildings.

- Friday: Street theater and a march near the Moscone Center.

- Saturday: HIV/AIDS Unity March. As many as 50,000 will march to the conference
center for a rally. Joining ACT UP will be the National Organization for Women,
Black Coalition on AIDS, San Francisco AIDS Foundation and dozens of other
groups. (One of ACT UP's goals is to build a diverse movement with a coalition
of organizations not involved before.)

''The medical profession is going to get very comfortable with AIDS, just like
it did with cancer,'' Nevins says. ''We can't let them make a living off of
AIDS. People are dying.''

''So we watch the huge research conglomerates, and we follow the politics of who
gets the grants, and which grant applications get read,'' Gold says. ''We're
thinking of the people with AIDS as the center of everything ... rather than
merely the needs of a big-shot doctor.''

''We're trying to get a national AIDS activist movement happening,'' Bracamonte
says. ''So we can be stronger. If we can all get together and target one group,
so the more impact we have, the better.''

Ontario bars discrimination against people with AIDS

BYLINE: By Kelly Toughill Toronto Star

SECTION: INSIGHT; Pg. B5

LENGTH: 1199 words


   Raj Anand hopes the message is clear: Discriminating against people with AIDS
in Ontario is illegal.

With very few exceptions, you can't fire or refuse to hire people with AIDS. You
can't turn them away from your restaurant, dental office or apartment building.
You can't insist they be tested and you can't object if your child's teacher or
classroom playmate is infected with the AIDS virus.

"Some people aren't clear that AIDS is a protected disability," says Anand,
chief commissioner of the agency charged with protecting human rights in
Ontario.

"What I'm saying in no uncertain terms is that people with AIDS and people
carrying the AIDS virus are protected under our code. That means you can't be
excluded from the workplace on the basis of having AIDS unless to do so causes
unreasonable risk to patients, customers or co-workers. In most workplaces, it's
virtually impossible to demonstrate a risk that justifies excluding a person
with AIDS."

That message is a hard one for some people to accept. Those who watch the
mounting tally of AIDS deaths worry that they or their loved ones might get
infected with the virus. Employers worry that hiring a person with AIDS might
hurt their business if the public finds out. Some worry that infected policemen,
pilots or politicians might develop AIDS-related dementia and harm themselves or
others.

DRUG USERS

CAPES

AIDS is caused by a virus that is found in blood and semen and commonly spread
by sexual intercourse and by needle sharing among intravenous drug users. It
can't be picked up while shaking hands, sharing equipment or tools, playing
sports, eating a meal prepared by someone who is infected or through other forms
of casual contact.

Almost a dozen AIDS-related complaints have been filed with the Ontario Human
Rights Commission since the disease first appeared in Canada in 1979. Most are
from employees who feel they've been treated unfairly because of their illness.
But others deal with alleged discrimination by dentists, insurance companies and
the government itself.

Each one is a little different. Each one will more precisely define how people
with AIDS must be treated by society.

* The recent case of nurse Ron Lentz was "enormously significant for persons
with AIDS and for the community at large in terms of structuring the workplace,"
says Anand.

Lentz's complaint was the first AIDS-related human rights case in Canada to
reach a board of inquiry. Lentz says he was fired from Toronto Western Hospital
because he has AIDS. The commission agreed. The hospital settled the case before
the board of inquiry made its decision. Lentz was reinstated with back pay.

While the case clearly showed that hospitals can't fire health-care workers with
AIDS, it didn't decide whether they have the right to demand people with AIDS be
separated from patients. In his new job, Lentz stares into a television monitor.
He has no hands-on contact with patients.

* The most recent complaint may decide that issue. On Thursday the commission
launched its own complaint against the merged Toronto Western Hospital and
Toronto General Hospital, saying a new infectious diseases policy may be an
illegal form of discrimination.

The policy requires employees, volunteers and students at the hospital to reveal
if they are carrying one of 13 diseases, including the virus that causes AIDS.

The commission will investigate whether AIDS should be on that list, and whether
everyone in the hospital should be subject to the policy.

A federal guideline allows health-care workers to be transferred if they perform
"invasive procedures" such as surgery on patients.

* One man complained that a small-town hospital refused him outpatient treatment
because he has AIDS. The case is under investigation.

* Two people have complained they were unable to get insurance because they have
AIDS.

One case involved a complaint against the person's employer. It was dismissed
because the employee gave the company doctor false information.

The second case was directly against the insurance company and is under
investigation.

* An employee of a Toronto advertising agency has complained he was fired
because he has AIDS. The case is being investigated.

* A worker at an eye clinic complained he was told not to work with patients
because he has AIDS. That case also is under investigation.

* One man with AIDS complained that a dentist refused to treat him because he
had AIDS. The man has since died, but his executor has pressed on with his
complaint. The commission is trying to reach a settlement in the case.

* In one case, the commission agreed an institution could fire an employee
because he had AIDS. The case involved someone with AIDS who cared for adults
who often bit, scratched and poked the employees. After an investigation and
consultation with medical experts, the commission decided there was sufficient
risk of infection that the employee should be removed. The complaint was
withdrawn.

Ninety per cent of all employees in Ontario fall under the wing of the
provincial rights commission.

Complaints filed with the commission represent only a tip of the iceberg, Anand
says. He estimates that for every complaint, there are five to 10 similar
situations that go unreported.

"Complaints handling will never do the job that needs to be done," he says. "In
all areas where we seek to prevent discrimination, public education is the
number one way to do that."

The commission has broad powers to remedy discrimination, including ordering
changes in the workplace or in company policies, that employees be rehired and
that those who were discriminated against be paid damages.

There are no specific standards or rules about what is allowed in dealing with
people with AIDS, Anand says, because each case is different.

"The principal is very simple. Employers have the right to set reasonable job
requirements, even if they unintentionally discriminate against people who have
AIDS or any other disability. Employers must make a reasonable accommodation for
disabilities, as long as it doesn't create undue hardship."

LARGE FACTORY

For example, many people with AIDS are periodically sick and unable to work,
with long stretches of being well in between. Employers must try to work around
the "innocent absenteeism," Anand says. That might be easy for a department
store or large factory, yet be an undue hardship for a two-man operation with a
tight production schedule.

There are few places where people with AIDS present a risk to the health of
others, Anand says. But even in cases where there is a risk, employers must
strive to accommodate the person with AIDS while protecting themselves.

Commissions all over Canada are mulling over these issues now, each one
interpreting the basic principles a little differently.

Ontario has been one of the most active provinces in protecting the rights of
people with AIDS.

"Our cases will be useful as an example in other provinces where, for example,
there is still some doubt whether AIDS is covered as a disability," Anand says.
"There is a ripple effect in terms of awareness and ability to proceed."

AIDS FLIGHT CREW CAN FLY - QANTAS

BYLINE: BOUTS T

LENGTH: 389 words


AIDS groups have welcomed the decision by Qantas to allow flight crew members
infected with AIDS to keep working.

The airline today confirmed AIDS sufferers were among flight crew working on
flights to and from Australia.

A Qantas spokesman said the decision was taken on the best and most extensive
medical advice.

"That advice tells us that there are two methods of transmission and they are
through blood-to-blood contact or sexual intercourse, neither of which is likely
to happen in the day-to-day activities of a member of the flight crew.

"Qantas regards AIDS as it would any other disability or illness," the spokesman
said.

The policy was applauded by the president of the Australian Federation of AIDS
Organisations, Dr David Plummer.

"I would be strongly supportive of it and encourage other companies and other
airlines to follow suit and take a similar approach," Dr Plummer said. "People
are at no risk from working people who are infected."

The Commonwealth's education and services adviser on AIDS, Prof. Ron Penny, said
today that more than 12 reasonably large Australian companies, including Qantas,
Prudential and AMP, were now looking at the question of AIDS in the workplace.

He said the National Advisory Committee on AIDS had started an AIDS-in-business
campaign which aimed to prompt corporations to start examing the AIDS issue.

Many of the country's biggest companies - Esso, Qantas, BHP and AMP - have
formulated policies to deal with the disease.

Esso's policy states that the company will not test for AIDS at the
pre-employment examination and will regard people with AIDS or the HIV antibody
as being fit for work while they have continued health and fitness and can
perform their job safely.

Coles Myer, Telecom and Elders IXL do not have any immediate plans to draw up an
AIDS policy for their companies, but spokesmen for each said they were looking
at the situation.

In a staff magazine, Coles Myer said the company was not planning to introduce
testing for AIDS.

BHP is not considering AIDS testing for employees either.

A spokesman for the company said management was monitoring the situation and
believed there was no sign of anxiety over AIDS and that staff were generally
well- informed about the disease.

AIDS 'will strike at the heart of families'

SOURCE: aap

BYLINE: DAN MCDONNELL

LENGTH: 727 words


SYDNEY - AIDS would intimately affect the lives of thousands of Australians as
worldwide cases increased to as many as 3m within five years, the
Governor-General, Sir Ninian Stephen, said yesterday.

He said the number of full AIDS cases would rise at a horrifying rate even if
further spread of the virus were halted immediately.

"As this fatal infection spreads many of us will have friends and relatives who
die of it," Sir Ninian said.

"It will strike at the heart of whole families."

Sir Ninian was delivering the opening address at a special World Health
Organisation Asian-Pacific meeting on AIDS attended by health ministers and
officials from 27 countries at Sydney's Westmead Hospital.

He said it was estimated that between 5m and 10m people worldwide were carrying
the AIDS virus although just more than 50,000 cases of full AIDS had been
reported. Many of these people did not even know they were infected.

If one thing was certain it was "that the reported incidence of AIDS sufferers
is going to increase at a horrifying rate in the years ahead".

Sir Ninian said AIDS was different from the diseases that swept the world in the
past because it was known how the virus spread.

"We know AIDS is preventable," he said. "One does not catch it by chance except
in very rare and exceptional circumstances or where bloodbanks have been allowed
to become infected.

"Its spread is directly related to the acts of individuals."

Dr Jonathan Mann, director of the World Health Organisation's special program on
AIDS, warned the public to be careful of claims of "miracle cures" against the
killer disease.

He said enormous progress had been made in AIDS research but a breakthrough was
still a long way off. Reports of miracle discoveries appeared in the Press on
occasions. "But the announcement almost always coincides with the rise in value
of the stock of the company making the announcement," he said. "Then the Press
would later publish some disclosure that there were only a few mice being
treated, and so on.

"So we have to be prudent. There is enormous progress but the breakthrough has
not occurred and we have to be careful when we use the word breakthrough." He
said progress towards developing an anti-AIDS vaccine was also intense but
whether one could be created was still in doubt.

"We may or may not get a vaccine," he said.

"There are at least 20 different groups around the world working on developing a
vaccine." He believed there was an increasing likelihood a vaccine would be
developed.

The NSW Minister of Health, Mr Anderson, told the conference that 10,000 people
in NSW had been diagnosed as AIDS carriers, but thousands more were unaware of
their condition.

He said that within five years of the first diagnosed case in NSW, the State had
suffered 239 AIDS deaths, had 370 people with full-blown AIDS - more than double
last year's figure - and 495 cases of second-stage category "B" AIDS.

In PORT MORESBY, the Papua New Guinea Cabinet has adopetd guidelines under which
expatriate workers will be required to take an AIDS blood test and produce a
certificate showing they are clear of the disease before they are allowed in.

The Prime Minister, Mr Wingti, said the Cabinet also had directed AIDS be
declared a notifiable disease.

This statistical picture of AIDS was drawn from yesterday's speakers to the
conference:

54,408 cases of full AIDS worldwide have been reported from 121 countries.

The true figure for current full AIDS cases is likely to be between 100,000 and
150,000.

Worldwide, there could be between 500,000 and 3m people with full-blown AIDS by
1991.

Australia is expected to have 1000 cases of full AIDS by the end of 1988.

By 1991, 3000 cases are expected to have been diagnosed in Australia.

86 p.c. of Australians with full AIDS are aged between 20 and 50.

38 countries have each reported more than 50 cases of full AIDS.

161 cases have been reported from 19 Asian countries.

569 cases have been reported from countries in the South Pacific.

Homosexual and bisexual men account for 88 p.c. of Australia's AIDS cases.

Between 10 p.c. and 30 p.c. of people infected with the virus may develop full
AIDS on current estimates, but the figure could be as high as 100 p.c.

90 p.c. of all full AIDS cases involve people aged between 15 and 49.

Safe-sex plea in new AIDS fight

BYLINE: DEBORAH CORNWALL

LENGTH: 650 words


AIDS information programs have failed to stop many people from taking risks, the
chairman of the SA AIDS advisory committee, Dr Scott Cameron, said yesterday.

AIDS educators had reached "saturation point" with groups originally identified
as being at high risk, but many people still had not adopted safe sex practices,
Dr Cameron said.

A "second generation" AIDS education approach to modify behavior would be needed
to reach people's hearts, not just their minds.

With the whole community now at risk, the material would be aimed at all groups,
not just intravenous drug users and homosexuals.

Dr Cameron's comments follow yesterday's announcement by the Prime Minister, Mr
Hawke, that the Federal Government would launch an explicit national advertising
campaign on the dangers of AIDS and to promote the use of condoms.

Speaking on the Channel 9 Sunday program, Mr Hawke said he had rejected advice
that the Government could lose votes if the campaign was too explicit.

"Some people have put to me that it will be offensive to talk publicly about the
necessity of using condoms, to talk about the dimensions of the problem," Mr
Hawke said. "I said, 'Too bad'."

The Federal Cabinet had approved the national campaign, to begin shortly,
because of the "enormity" of the problem, he said.

Dr Cameron said his committee had done all it could to inform minority groups
about AIDS, but still had not altered the behavior of some people.

"People understand the threat of AIDS intellectually we now need to turn our
attention as to why there are some who continue to take risks," he said.

Dr Cameron said denial, fatalism or a hedonistic lifestyle were all factors why
some people, including those diagnosed as AIDS carriers, still resisted changing
their sexual behavior.

He rejected as "disastrous" any proposals to isolate AIDS carriers from the
community or try to restrict the behavior of diagnosed AIDS carriers by
threatening them with incarceration.

He said claims in yesterday's Sunday Mail that the State Government was planning
to introduce new draconian laws to allow public health authorities to lock up
people suspected or suffering from AIDS were false and misleading.

The State Government already had the power to arrest and examine people
suffering from 51 infectious diseases, including AIDS.

The proposed Notifiable Health Bill was, in effect, an updating of the existing
legislation, he said.

"I want to assure people nothing has changed," Dr Cameron said.

"Our system for handling AIDS carriers will continue to operate as it did under
the old Act.

"If we started threatening to arrest everybody who came in for AIDS testing we
would have disastrously little control we are operating on an honor system
because if we didn't AIDS carriers would simply go underground.

"Patient confidentiality and ongoing support for AIDS sufferers is paramount if
we are to limit the spread of the disease."

A comprehensive AIDS education program will be introduced in all SA secondary
schools from next term. A spokesman for the AIDS Council of SA, Mr Roger Knight,
said he welcomed assurances that there would be no changes to the system of
handling patients seeking AIDS testing.

Mr Knight said he feared the misleading impression created by the Sunday Mail
report would deter many South Australians from presenting themselves for
information and help about AIDS.

"When the NSW Government was considering special punitive measures against AIDS
carriers in 1985, the number of clients presenting for AIDS testing fell by 60
p.c.," he said.

On ABC radio last night, the manager of ABC Television in SA, Mr John Geyer,
said he backed the broadcasting of AIDS advertisements.

He said the ABC supported any AIDS campaign and was planning to screen the SA
Government's advertisements encouraging the use of condoms, probably within a
week or so.

Doggedly generous to a fault

BYLINE: ADAM CREIGHTON

SECTION: FEATURES; Pg. 15

LENGTH: 1718  words


Foreign aid is on the rise despite evidence it does little to reduce poverty

``WHO could be against `foreign aid' to help the unfortunate?'' asked Peter
Bauer in 1993. The very term, he thought, ``promotes an unquestioning attitude,
disarms critics, obscures realities and prejudges results; it has enabled aid
supporters to claim a monopoly of compassion and to dismiss critics as lacking
in understanding and sympathy''.

The British economics professor devoted his career to refuting the effectiveness
of foreign aid, but his arguments were ignored by bureaucratic armadas dependent
on foreign aid as well as innately generous, even guilt-ridden, public opinion
in the developed West.

Australia's aid budget will surge from $4.3 billion in 2010 to about $8bn a year
in 2015, on top of the $800 million a year Australians chip in privately. It's
part of bipartisan push to increase our aid spending from about 0.33 per cent of
national income to 0.5 per cent.

The Howard government signed Australia up to the Millennium Development Goals,
UN-led efforts to halve global poverty by 2015 and convince rich countries to
lift their aid spending, which is now collectively worth about $US134bn
($128.5bn) a year or 0.34 per cent of gross national income, to 0.7 per cent of
GNI.

Australia is relatively stingy: Greece, Spain and Portugal, at various stages of
being bailed out, together gave almost $US5.3bn in 2011. Italy inexplicably
increased its foreign aid budget 44 per cent to almost $US4.3bn in the same
year. Britain, mired in chronic deficit, last week decided to supercharge its
sizeable aid budget by a whopping pound stg. 3bn ($4.37bn) a year.

Advanced countries have doled out more than $2.3 trillion in aid since 1950.
Meanwhile, the number of people living in poverty -- defined by the World Bank
as living on less than $US1.25 a day -- has plummeted from 1.9 billion in 1981
to 1.3 billion today, about one-fifth of the world's population. More than 36
countries have graduated from low to middle incomes since 1960.

But little evidence suggests foreign aid is a leading cause.

``We do not subscribe to the fallacy that because graduation (from receiving
aid) took place after aid, it was even in part because of aid, since many
factors such as governance, trade and investment affect growth,'' concluded a
recent British House of Lords inquiry into the effectiveness of foreign aid,
which found aid ``at its most efficient might'' add as much as 0.5 per cent a
year to developing countries' annual per capita growth rates.

Economic growth is the most powerful engine for reducing poverty but ``the
evidence that aid makes a contribution to growth is inconclusive'', it found.
Oxfam says barely any of the MDGs are on track to be achieved by 2015.

``Countries that have developed have done so by their own efforts of
conventional, mainstream economics by building on comparative advantage through
trade, saving and investing,'' says former World Bank deputy director Helen
Hughes, who is now an emeritus professor at the Australian National University.

``Aid transfers money from poor people in rich countries to rich people in poor
countries,'' she adds, suggesting much of the funds were wasted in the
bureaucracies of donor and recipient countries.

``Countless empirical studies have failed to find a beneficial effect of
official foreign aid and the consensus aid has failed is nearly universal among
those who look at the data,'' wrote Harvard economics professor Andrei Shleifer
in 2009.

Certainly the embrace of free markets and rapid increase in economic growth in
China and India, home to one-third of the world's population, has been the key
driver for the slump in global poverty. The economic miracles in Singapore, Hong
Kong, Thailand, South Korea and, to a lesser extent, in Chile and Botswana are
testament to the power of lowering tariffs, freer trade, lower taxes, and
relaxation of controls on capital flows and foreign exchange.

Today, poverty is concentrated in Africa, where economic growth has stalled
despite being the longstanding focus of global aid efforts for decades. In the
period that the share of the population in extreme poverty fell from 56 per cent
to 14 per cent in East Asia, the decline in Africa was only from 57 per cent to
48 per cent.

Shleifer says ``aid destroys economic incentives, leads to misallocation of
scarce resources, and so not only fails to jump-start but actually undermines
growth''. Poor people look to aid rather than their own governments, which in
turn focus on attracting aid rather than improving governance models and
domestic policies.

In January, an independent review found the UN Development Program -- one of the
world's flagship aid programs, now headed by former New Zealand prime minister
Helen Clark, with an annual budget of about $5bn -- had ``limited ability to
demonstrate whether its poverty reduction activities have contributed to any
significant change in the lives of the people it is trying to help''.

``Many have only remote connections with poverty, if at all,'' it says,,
pointing for instance to dubiously worthwhile efforts to help countries write
compliance reports. It recommends the UNDP design projects in future with ``an
explicit pro-poor bias''. Australia's aid program is concentrated in the Pacific
and East Asia, which together absorbed 45 per cent of last year's aid budget.
Papua New Guinea and Indonesia are the biggest beneficiaries, receiving $501m
and $469m respectively.

Former foreign minister Alexander Downer says a huge amount of Australian aid is
wasted and the program should target our immediate region only. During the
Australian campaign for a temporary seat on the UN Security Council, the Rudd
government expanded aid to Africa, which is scheduled to grow from about $450m
to $870m a year by 2015.

``The focus should not be on specific financial targets like 0.5 per cent of
national income, which has become a kind of theology, but rather on programs
that genuinely improve the prospects for economic growth,'' Downer tells
Inquirer.

``It's all very well to focus on aggregate outcomes but if the aid is withdrawn
and things just fall back to where they were before, little real progress has
been made.''

AusAID, the government agency that distributes 90 per cent of Australia's aid
budget, boasts an impressive array of achievements: two million children were
immunised last year; an extra 230,000 women benefited from trained midwives when
giving birth; 2200 primary schools were built or upgraded; and three million
textbooks were provided.

Stephen Howes, professor of economics at ANU, supports Australia's foreign aid,
arguing it has led to great improvements in life expectancy and educational
outcomes, as well as reduced incidence of disease.

Even Hughes concedes Australia's scholarship has been effective because ``it
teaches people to fish rather than giving them a fish''.

Howes says AusAID has made admirable efforts to increase transparency,
accountability and strategy during the past decade and the government deserves
credit for commissioning an independent review of Australia's aid program, which
Howes co-authored in 2011. Nevertheless, he says AusAID's first internal review
of its effectiveness -- one of Howes's key recommendations -- painted too rosy a
picture of Australia's aid.

``It's very different from the review we had in mind,'' he says. ``One can gain
no sense from it of how effective Australia's bilateral aid is in particular
country contexts, or of how effective some of AusAID's major multilateral
partners are, or of what is really going pear-shaped.''

Delving further into AusAID data shows only five out of nine objectives in
Australia's foreign aid program for Indonesia have been given a green light. In
PNG, the figure is three out of 10; in Solomon Islands, it's one; and in
Afghanistan it's zero.

Foreign aid programs are always bedevilled by conflicting national foreign
policy objectives. ``Aid to Indonesia and other Asian countries is purely
political,'' says Hughes, who argues Australia's foreign aid program has
``failed utterly'' to foster development in PNG, Fiji and the Solomons.

``The Rudd government's expansion of aid to Africa aimed to cover as many
countries as possible,'' Howes adds.

Benjamin Herscovitch, a policy analyst at the Centre for Independent Studies,
doubts the efficacy of Australia's aid in Afghanistan in particular, which
totals $180m this year. ``With international troops set to withdraw by 2014 and
the Taliban poised to retake vast swaths of the country, the effectiveness of
aid money is in doubt,'' he says.

Voters can exert discipline on their own bureaucracies, at least to the extent
they deliver popular services, but aid organisations have remote beneficiaries
with no electoral sway -- a situation that creates perfect conditions for waste
and inefficiency.

However, Australia performed well in a 2008 study by US academic and aid critic
William Easterly that exhaustively compared the efficiency and quality of aid
spending; Australia finished sixth, with administration costs chewing up only 2
per cent of development assistance. It is all relative, though: more than 60 per
cent of AusAID's 2184 staff are in Canberra, including almost 250 earning
between $120,000 and $300,000 a year.

Globally, projects proliferate under the aegis of various aid agencies.
Australia provides aid to almost 90 countries directly and indirectly.

Easterly calculated in 2008 that the probability that two randomly selected
dollars in the international aid effort were from the same donor in the same
country was one in 2658.

Richard Nixon famously said in 1970 that there weren't any votes in foreign aid.
According to Essential Media polling, there still aren't, at least in Australia.

More than 40 per cent of voters think the government spends too much on foreign
aid, compared with 16 per cent who want it to spend more.

Foreign aid, even if of dubious benefit to the recipients, may still be better
use of public money, given modern governments seem almost incapable of cutting
taxes. Foreign aid is better use of public money than domestic programs where
the empirical or theoretical justification is even weaker, such as the Gillard
government's desire to spend billions more on schools.

At Work;
AIDS Awareness Goes to the Office

BYLINE: By BARBARA PRESLEY NOBLE

SECTION: Section 3; Page 25; Column 3; Financial Desk

LENGTH: 921 words


The Federal Government last week used the occasion of World AIDS Day to launch
"Business Responds to AIDS," a workplace awareness and education program.
Several officials, including Health and Human Services Secretary Louis W.
Sullivan, encouraged employers to provide education on AIDS for all employees
and support for employees who have AIDS or are infected with the human
immunodeficiency virus.

"Our goal is to prevent new infections of H.I.V., the AIDS virus, among
employees, families and the communities in which they live," Mr. Sullivan told a
national teleconference based in Atlanta.

The program is a sibling of an earlier educational effort, "America Responds to
AIDS," which was directed to the public at large. Dr. William Roper, director of
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the workplace was a natural
next target. "Most Americans spend eight hours a day, five days a week at work.
It is a prime venue," he said.

More than 1 million Americans -- one in 250 -- are now thought to be infected
with H.I.V. Most people infected are young adults between the ages of 25 and 44,
the age category that contains half the nation's workers.

The C.D.C. consulted with the National Leadership Coalition on AIDS, a
Washington-based group that advises business and labor on AIDS issues, the
American Red Cross and other organizations to develop a network of resources. A
"Manager's Kit" available from the C.D.C. includes posters and pamphlets on a
variety of topics, including how to devise workplace policies, AIDS and
insurance and AIDS and the Americans with Disabilities Act.

The Federal initiative arrives more than a decade into the AIDS epidemic and
long after the workplace implications of AIDS were apparent, some critics say.
And if the Government considers its job done by publishing handbooks and
posters, it should think again.

"Government leadership is important. Their entry is welcome," said Carisa
Cunningham, a spokeswoman for the AIDS Action Council, a Washington lobbying
group for AIDS organizations. "But if the plan is to put something in the mail
and have it on people's desks, it won't have much of an impact."

But if individuals have had some time and reason to assimilate the dimensions of
the AIDS crisis, many companies have not. The initiative comes as awareness of
protections guaranteed by the A.D.A., which went in effect this year, is
growing. People with AIDS and H.I.V. infection are covered by the A.D.A. and are
thus part of the group employers must "reasonably accommodate" on the job.

Any company grappling for the first time with AIDS as an issue in the workplace
is likely to find some comfort in the material pulled together by the coalition
of concerned groups. "What's new about this," says the C.D.C.'s Mr. Roper, "is
the partnership of a host of organizations that haven't seen themselves as
active."

One larger effect of "Business Responds to AIDS," Mr. Roper says, may be that
companies will become more sensitive to the needs of people with long-term or
chronic illness.

For help in providing workplace education on H.I.V./AIDS or establishing company
policies, contact the following organizations:

The Centers for Disease Control AIDS Hotline (800-342-AIDS; 800-243-7889: TDD
service for the hearing impaired) provides confidential information, referrals
and publications.

Clearinghouse BRTA Resource Service (P.O. Box 6003, Rockville, Md. 20849-6003;
800-458-5231; 800-243-7012: TDD).

The National Leadership Coalition on AIDS (1730 M Street, Suite 905, Washington,
D.C. 20036; 202-429-0930) maintains a Workplace Resource Center.

Education and Defense Fund's A.D.A. Hotline at 800-466-4ADA (Voice/TDD).



THE PRINCIPLES BEHIND THE POLICIES

Several companies have adopted as policy the principles developed by the
Citizens Commission on AIDS of New York City and Northern New Jersey. A sample:

* People with AIDS or the H.I.V. infection are entitled to the same rights and
opportunities as people with other serious or life-threatening illnesses.

* At the very least, policies should comply with all relevant laws and
regulations.

* Policies should be based on the scientific fact that H.I.V. cannot be
transmitted through ordinary workplace contact.

* Upper-level management should support policies and programs and communicate
their support to employees.

* Employers should provide up-to-date information on risk-reduction in
employees' lives.

* Employers should protect the confidentiality of employee medical information.

* Employers should institute education programs for all employees before any
problems in the workplace arise.

* H.I.V. screening should not be required as part of pre-employment or routine
workplace medical examinations.

* In settings where there is potential risk of H.I.V. exposure -- in hospitals,
for example -- employers should provide training and appropriate equipment to
insure that infection-control procedures are followed.

Surge in AIDS Cases in Congo Could Be an Omen for africa

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE; Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: POINTE-NOIRE, Congo


Jean-Marie Matsiona, a 38-year-old oil tanker navigator, is one of the one
million Africans expected to die of AIDS in the next decade.

Not long ago at his bedside, as early evening fell, his wife, Rose, took a rest,
easing onto the edge of his bed.

As relatives continued the chores of the African hospital, unrolling reed
sleeping mats and scraping chicken bones into a garbage can, Mrs. Matsiona
kicked off her sandals and talked about her five children.

'If He Gets Well'

''Prisca, the oldest, is 15,'' she said. ''She wants to go to Togo to study to
become a customs agent. She likes the uniform.

''Of course, that depends on him - if he gets well,'' said Mrs. Matsiona, a
nurse, glancing at her husband.

With about 5 percent of Congo's 2 million people infected with the AIDS virus
HIV, doctors predict that 100,000 Congolese will die of AIDS in a decade. A
similar rate of infection in the United States would mean 12 million Americans
dead in a decade.

Increasingly, AIDS is reaching into Africa's embryonic middle class, striking
down skilled men like Mr. Matsiona who represent Congo's investment in the
future.

'Like a War for Us'

''If there is no vaccine, it will be like a war for us,'' said Pierre Mpele,
secretary of Congo's Committee to Combat AIDS.

In the office of a foreign oil company here, a British executive pondered the
rising rate of AIDS virus infection among skilled Congolese workers. ''For
Africa, it could be like World War I, when much of the young elite of Britain
and France were killed,'' he said.

The situation in Congo is no better and no worse than in the seven other
countries of what is known as Africa's AIDS belt: Zaire, Zambia, Tanzania,
Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda and the Central African Republic.

Surveys in the capitals of these countries indicate a 5 percent average rate of
AIDS virus infection among urban adults. In Africa, the AIDS virus is
transmitted largely through heterosexual intercourse and blood transfusions and
from mother to newborn infant. The strain of AIDS virus here is HIV-1, the
originally discovered AIDS virus that is causing disease in large areas of
Africa, the United States and elsewhere in the world. A second virus, HIV-2, has
recently been discovered in West Africa and is believed to be causing a similar
disease there.

Five years after the first AIDS victim was diagnosed in Congo, this country is
now an example of the sudden ravages of the disease in Africa. Here, as in much
of Africa, the long-awaited flood of AIDS victims now laps at the doors of
hospitals.

One-third of the babies interned at the Adolphe Sice Hospital here are suffering
from AIDS.

In Brazzaville, Congo's capital, Dr. Marie C. Samba Lefebre, who is French,
reports that 15 to 20 new AIDS patients have been arriving every month for the
last 18 months at her hospital, Makelekele. ''It is quickly becoming the largest
disease in the infectious disease ward,'' she said.

The number of patients suffering from ''zona,'' a skin rash that is often a
precursor of AIDS, has increased 12-fold since 1980, she said.

In Congo, malaria, tuberculosis and sleeping sickness probably kill about 10,000
people a year - far more than the 1,200 known cases of people who have developed
AIDS here. Yet for Africans who can afford medical care, these diseases are
largely preventable and curable.

In contrast AIDS, which has no known cure, is a democratic disease, cutting a
swath through all social classes. In addition to Mr. Matsiona, other AIDS
victims in the wards this month included a mechanic for Elf Congo, the French
oil company; an office worker for Air Afrique, West Africa's regional airline,
and a middle-level manager for Congo-Ocean, the national railroad.

Employees Tested Yearly

In 1985, Elf Congo, the largest foreign company here, started testing all
employees for the AIDS virus once a year. Last year, 10 of 20 deaths among its
active-duty employees were traced to AIDS. In interviews, company doctors
declined to disclose the level of infection among the 1,000 employees, saying
that virtually all the tests had been made with the Elisa method, which has a
high margin of error. Last month, Elf also began using the more accurate Western
Blot method to check the Elisa results.

In Brazzaville, AIDS sufferers include army officers, engineers, high school
teachers, business people and medical and laboratory technicians.

''AIDS is hitting the young professionals particularly hard,'' Dr. Mpele of the
AIDS Committee said recently.

Outside his office at the University Hospital Center, it was standing room only
for 16 blood-positive outpatients -army officers, housewives, laborers and
office workers in coats and ties.

Last year, some African countries started HIV blood tests for all students who
win overseas scholarships. In a major embarrassment here, the Soviet Union last
year sent home about 10 Congolese students who tested positive.

''We have a military officer in his 30's who is supposed to go to France for
higher training,'' said Dr. Pierre Eozenou, director of the Health Ministry's
epidemiology service in Brazzaville. ''He just tested positive. What do we do
now?''

The profile of Congo's population seems to guarantee the continued spread of
AIDS.

Tribal Restraints Fading

Three-quarters of the country's people are under 40 years of age, a figure
similar to that in much of Africa. Furthermore, three-quarters live in cities.

Urbanization has meant rapid breakdown of traditional tribal restraints. Today,
life for many urban Africans is marked by multiple sexual partners and
widespread venereal disease. For example, the prevalence of gonorrhea is 10
percent in Kampala, Uganda, compared with three-tenths of 1 percent in London.
Untreated venereal disease speeds transmission of the AIDS-causing virus,
researchers say.

Throughout Africa, prostitutes are believed to be major transmitters of the AIDS
virus. Surveys last year found that 34 percent of prostitutes tested in
Brazzaville and 64 percent in Pointe Noire had the virus. ''We tell our men when
they arrive that if they go with a prostitute, they are stupid,'' the British
oilman said.

In the gloom, there are some rays of hope. Congo, like virtually all countries
of sub-Saharan Africa, has started an AIDS information program. Warnings about
the new disease have been broadcast in posters, television roundtables, radio
call-in shows and question-and-answer sessions at high schools.

Students Are More Aware

The public health campaign is having an impact.

Last year, health workers polled two groups of 320 Brazzaville High School
students, one in May and the other in November. In six months, the total
percentage of students who responded that Congo has ''some'' or ''a lot'' of
AIDS jumped to 38 percent from 20 percent. The percent who said that Congo had
''no'' AIDS fell to 12 percent from 18 percent. Asked how AIDS is transmitted,
79 percent wrote ''sexual relations.''

But unlike cholera or measles, which can be avoided with simple vaccinations,
avoiding AIDS demands major changes in the way of life for many Africans. Here,
the Congolese students proved less inclined to put their knowledge to practice.

Among 18- and 19-year-old men and women, 93 percent of those surveyed said they
had had sexual relations. About half of the women and three-quarters of the men
knew about condoms. But only a quarter of the men and one-fifth of the women
said they had ever used one.

Condom use is low in part because the price of condoms in pharmacies here - $1
apiece - is high. This year, international aid organizations plan to import
large quantities of condoms, which sharply diminish the chances of AIDS
transmission.

To coordinate AIDS-related assistance to Congo, the World Health Organization
plans to sponsor a financial donors' conference here next month.

Similar conferences last year raised funds for AIDS programs in Uganda,
Tanzania, Rwanda, Kenya and Ethiopia. This year, the organization plans meetings
to raise money for AIDS programs in 24 additional African nations.

So far, virtually all AIDS research and assistance in Congo has come from
France. Dr. Mpele said American researchers and AIDS workers would be welcome
here.

Throughout Africa, nations confront the AIDS epidemic with health care budgets
that are starved for money.

For example, in this city of 200,000 people, the annual budget of the sole
public health hospital is estimated at about $200,000 - roughly the amount of
money spent in the United States to care for four AIDS patients.

Through French aid, this hospital received its first Elisa machine to detect
antibodies to the HIV virus in donated blood last month.

Can't Afford to Doublecheck

Of the first 92 blood samples from donors given the Elisa test, 21 tested
positive for HIV-1. Although it is clear that about one-third of the results may
be false positives, no one can afford to doublecheck. Elisa tests cost $3 each.
The highly accurate Western Blot test used across town at the health clinic
costs $30.

But Elisa testing can sharply cut the spread of AIDS through transfusions.

In Brazzaville, the University Hospital started testing all blood for
transfusions in 1986. Since then the number of babies falling sick with AIDS
acquired in blood transfusions has dropped to zero, according to Dr. Herve
Plassart, a pediatrician there.

In what may prove to have the sharpest effect on public opinion, doctors here
increasingly tell patients that they have AIDS. Until Congo's first national
AIDS symposium was held in Brazzaville last month, Government policy forbade
doctors to tell patients that they were ill with AIDS.

As most doctors inform their patients and as knowledge of AIDS cases spreads by
word-of-mouth, the disease may lose its current image as an ''affaire de
blancs'' - a white man's worry.

Too Late for Many

All these measures will be too late for thousands of Congolese, including Mr.
Matsiona.

The other evening at the hospital here, Mrs. Matsiona put down a doily she was
crocheting and stood up to adjust an oscillating fan she had brought from home
to cool her husband's fever.

''He will get better, I'm sure - he always was a little thin,'' she said,
looking down at the emaciated frame of her husband, who had finally fallen
asleep.

A doctor interviewed later was less hopeful. He predicted that Mr. Matsiona
would be dead by spring.

AIDS AMONG CLERGY PRESENTS CHALLENGES TO CATHOLIC CHURCH

BYLINE: By ROBERT LINDSEY, Special to the New York Times

SECTION: Section A; Page 15, Column 1; National Desk

LENGTH: 1243 words

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 1


Some Roman Catholic officials have begun to acknowledge reports from doctors,
social workers and others that members of the Catholic clergy, like Americans in
other sectors of society, are suffering and dying from AIDS.

Because many victims of AIDS have tried to hide the nature of their illness, and
because of what some contend is a reluctance by church officials to acknowledge
its existence among those who have taken vows of celibacy, it is not known how
many priests and non-ordained Catholic brothers have been diagnosed as having
AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, which is usually transmitted by
sexual or intravaneous exchange of body fluids. No one has been known to
recover.

Tiny Fraction, Church Says

Some people within the church say it has caused the deaths of at least a dozen
priests and suggest the number could be substantially higher. Church spokesmen
say that whatever the total number, it is a tiny fraction of the more than
57,000 Catholic clergymen in the United States.

While it is impossible to document the national scope of the problem,
physicians, churchmen and social workers interviewed last week in several cities
around the country said the number of Catholic clergymen affected by AIDS was on
the rise, throwing a new spotlight of skepticism on the integrity of the
church's requirement of priestly celibacy.

Larry Kessler, director of the AIDS Action Committee of Massachusetts, said four
Catholic clergymen had died of AIDS in the Boston area over the last five years
and at least two others now have the disease. ''It would not surprise me if
there were more cases,'' he said. ''Some priests may be afraid to tell the
Chancery. I think AIDS challenges the myth of celibacy like nothing in this
century.''

In Chicago, three Catholic brothers and a parish priest died in 1986 as a result
of AIDS, according to William F. McCullough, director of the city's AIDS
Assistance Foundation. In Houston, a physician said he was currently treating
almost a dozen priests who have the disease. In New York, counselors who work
with AIDS patients say that at least three priests have died as a result of the
virus in recent years.

The Rev. James Lynch, a priest assigned by the Archdiocese of New York to
counsel AIDS patients, said an undetermined number of Catholic clergymen had
probably died from the disease without notice because they, like men in other
professions, had been able to conceal the nature of their illness.

Epidemiologists predict that the number of AIDS cases will continue to rise for
some time; Father Lynch said it was likely that the number of priests and
brothers affected by the disease would rise, too.

According to AIDS researchers, the disease is most commonly transmitted in
sexual relations between homosexual men.

AIDS has affected a broad range of Americans, including rabbis, Episcopal
priests, Baptist ministers and other clergymen, according to AIDS counselors
here. But the increasing awareness that its victims include Catholic clergymen
has posed a problem for the church because of the implication that some priests
and brothers have not only broken their vows of celibacy but have also engaged
in homosexual acts in violation of church laws.

Reaction Differs Widely

According to people inside and outside the church, the church's reaction to the
discovery that a priest or brother has AIDS has varied widely. They say many
bishops and superiors of monastic orders have responded with grief and
compassion, while others have virtually driven AIDS patients out of the church.

One Houston physician, who spoke on condition that he not be identified, said
that he had treated three Catholic priests who died of AIDS, adding that they
were ostracized when their superiors learned of the illness. ''They were
ejected, just told to leave,'' he said. ''I don't think they had any choice.''

He said that four other patients who are still living had decided to leave the
church and returned to their families to prevent a scandal in their parishes.

''I think the men I've treated made a big effort to spare their colleagues and
the church any embarrassment,'' he said. In return, fellow priests responded by
visiting the dying men and giving them the sacraments.

Physicians say that virtually all AIDS patients, facing the certainty of death,
respond with despair and sadness when it is discovered they have the disease.
They say the experience can be especially stressful on Catholic clergymen who,
as homosexuals, have led a secret life and suddenly face not only death but the
loss of their job, pride, status, religious identity and the support system of
their religious community.

Mr. McCulloch, director of the AIDS Assistance Foundation in Chicago, said a
parish priest had spent nine months at a home for AIDS patients in Chicago
before dying last September.

Fear of Rejection

''He was frightened because he'd seen a lot of rejection of people with AIDS and
frightened of what people would think of him,'' Mr. McCulloch said. ''He loved
the people so much in his parish he wouldn't let anyone know. He tried to keep
it as quiet as possible.'' The Rev. Michael Lopes, a Dominican priest who
counsels AIDS patients for the Catholic Social Service in San Francisco, said
some priests had simply disappeared after discovering they had AIDS, dropping
out of their religious community in an effort to keep their illness secret.
Others admit they have AIDS and denounce the church for its attitude toward
homosexuality, he said, while still others see the illness as a kind of
opportunity to serve God.

Still, Father Lopes said, few priests feel guilty about contracting the disease.
''More experience ecstasy,'' he said. ''One person said to me: 'God has chosen
me to be an instrument of healing to help others, to use my illness as a way to
serve.' ''

Most senior church officials who were interviewed said they knew of few, if any,
priests who had AIDS, adding that they did not believe it was a serious problem
and that they would respond with charity and compassion if they were told a
priest had the disease.

''Once someone has AIDS, we are dealing with someone who has a lethal and
terminal disease,'' said Archbishop John R. Quinn of San Francisco. ''We must
help that person to prepare for a peaceful death. That doesn't mean that the
church condones what is unacceptable.''

Although Father Lopes has praised Archbishop Quinn as being a strong supporter
of efforts to help AIDS patients, he and other priests working with people who
have AIDS say the church has not faced the reality of the problem.

''The church has no coherent policy on AIDS,'' Father Lopes said. ''AIDS will
force us to take a closer look at sexuality and death and to be more aware of
what God is saying in this age.''

The Rev. John J. Saltzmann, a Benedictine priest in Boston, said he believed
there had been less of an effort by the church hierarchy to cover up the
incidence of AIDS among the clergy than some critics had suggested.

''The church people I know of in Boston who have been sick were and are being
taken care of very well,'' he said. ''What is seen as an institutional masking
of a problem often is the request of an individual for confidentiality.''

But Father Saltzman said he believed the church must ''overcome some of its fear
of AIDS and its ramifications.'' He added, ''Fear is much too operative in the
church's response to the problem.''

STATE FIGHTING AIDS WITH INFORMATION

BYLINE: By LAURIE A. O'NEILL

SECTION: Section 11CN; Page 1, Column 1; Connecticut Weekly Desk

LENGTH: 1788 words


WITH neither a vaccine nor a cure in sight, public and private health care and
social service agencies in Connecticut are fighting the spread of AIDS ''with
the only tool we have available - education,'' said Dr. James L. Hadler, chief
of the State Department of Health Services' epidemiology section.

''We are trying to get the right information out, not only to people in
high-risk groups, but to health professionals, community leaders and to the
general public, which is not thinking rationally about this,'' said William
Sabella, the Health Department's AIDS coordinator.

There have been 157 cases of AIDS (139 males and 18 females) reported to the
Health Department since July 1983, when state surveillance of AIDS cases began.
Of those cases, 87 people have died, including 3 infants. On average, nine new
AIDS cases are turning up each month, Mr. Sabella said. ''And we expect, as does
the Centers for Disease Control, that the figures will double every year for the
next five years at least,'' he said.

Connecticut ranks 13th in the incidence of AIDS, acquired immune deficiency
syndrome, with its 157 known cases accounting for about 1.1 percent of those
reported nationwide, Mr. Sabella said. When that figure is adjusted by
Connecticut's population of about 3 million, however, the state ranks ''somewhat
higher, probably due to our proximity to New York City, the epicenter of the
problem,'' he said.

The highest number of AIDS cases in Connecticut, 59, has been reported in
Fairfield County. New Haven County has 49 cases, and Hartford County, 33. Only a
few cases each have been reported in the state's less populated, more rural
sections like Litchfield and Windham Counties, he said.

AIDS is a condition that breaks down the immune system, leaving victims
vulnerable to a variety of infections, rare illnesses and cancers that do not
normally affect healthy people.

Experts say the AIDS virus is not transmitted through casual contact with people
who have the disease, are infected with the virus or are in high-risk groups:
homosexual or bisexual men, intravenous drug users, hemophiliacs, blood
transfusion recipients or the sexual partners, male or female, of such people.

It is safe to give blood in licensed blood centers or to receive blood, said Jan
Jaskiewicz of the American Red Cross in Farmington. ''We now test every blood
sample and we have always used new, sterile equipment for each donor,'' she
said.

The virus can be transmitted by direct contact with an infected person's body
fluids, primarily blood or semen. Of the 93 known Connecticut cases, 93 involve
homosexual or bisexual males, Mr. Sabella said. There have been 33 cases among
intravenous drug users. The other cases include a small number of hemophiliacs
and of children who apparently contracted the disease while in the womb or
during birth. The rest are victims whose link to a high-risk group has not yet
been made.

Mr. Sabella estimated that between 5,000 and 15,000 Connecticut residents have
been infected with the AIDS virus, which has an incubation period of between a
few months and five years. But he said it was believed that the majority of
those infected would never develop AIDS or the lesser, though sometimes fatal,
symptoms of AIDS-related complex.

Mr. Sabella's work as AIDS coordinator for the state is financed by a Federal
grant. He collects reports from doctors and other health workers and converts
the names of AIDS victims into code before submitting them to the National
Centers for Disease Control. The actual reports, with the victims' names, are
known only to Mr. Sabella and kept in a locked file at the Health Department.

To date, Dr. Hadler and Mr. Sabella have been responsible for handling AIDS
issues - providing public information, developing state policies and keeping
track of cases. ''It's become increasingly apparent,'' Dr. Hadler said, ''that
we need more help so that the Health Department can take a more aggressive
stance on this problem.''

Governor O'Neill recently approved the spending of about $350,000 to add 10
positions, of which 7 will be professional and 3 clerical, to the epidemiology
section by early next year. The larger staff will enable the state to provide
more public information, address more directly the needs of high-risk groups,
offer counseling and conduct AIDS screening, he said.

''Mostly, we need to allay public anxiety,'' Mr. Sabella said. ''People fear
that everyone is going to get AIDS sooner or later.''

The Health Department and other state agencies have put forth guidelines for use
by schools, prisons and other public institutions. The state says, for example,
that children with AIDS or AIDS-related complex should be allowed to attend
school as long as they do not demonstrate serious behavioral problems like
biting, and are not acutely ill.

Some Connecticut school districts are making their own AIDS policies, however,
and a few have already chosen not to follow state guidelines.

Two New Haven children with AIDS were denied admission to kindergarten this fall
and are being tutored ''in another setting,'' according to Dr. John Dow Jr., the
New Haven Superintendent of Schools. There is a third child who is suspected of
having AIDS and if a diagnosis is confirmed, that child will also be removed, he
said.

''Connecticut has a law that says a child with a communicable disease is to be
excluded from school,'' he said. ''And we consider AIDS a communicable
disease.''

The Hartford school system has no known cases of AIDS or of AIDS-related
complex, but the Board of Education has adopted a policy that would temporarily
exclude such children from school and provide them with tutors while their cases
are assessed by a panel composed of the child's parents, physician, teacher and
principal, the school's physician and a representative from the City Health
Department.

The children will be returned to class unless they are too ill or are a behavior
problem, said Lynn Dolan, a spokesman for the school system.

In Plymouth, where about 2,000 youngsters are enrolled in public schools and
there are no known cases of AIDS or AIDS-related complex, the Board of Education
has agreed to exclude such children permanently and to educate them in another
setting, said Dr. Virginia Grzymkowski, the Superintendent of Schools.

''Emotions run so high on this issue and media hype is so intense,'' she said.
''You just can't cut through that. We wanted to be prepared for 'if' -and should
you look at the statistics, it's more like 'when' - an AIDS child turns up.''

The Connecticut Department of Correction has decided to isolate AIDS cases in
the state prison system. There are now 14 known cases of AIDS-related complex
and 1 of AIDS among prisoners in the state, according to Dr. Edward Wurzel,
director of health services for the Correction Department. As of Dec. 1, all
male prisoners with AIDS or the complex will be placed in a separate ward at the
state prison in Somers. Shortly thereafter, women with the disease will be moved
into a separate ward at the state prison for women in Niantic.

''As far as what's known about AIDS, there is no medical reason to isolate these
prisoners,'' Dr. Wurzel said. ''But there is a tremendous emotional reason - the
concerns of the staff and of the other prisoners.''

While the state expands its Health Department to deal with the AIDS problem,
private groups helping victims and their families and providing information on
the disease say they are overwhelmed by the demand for their services.

''It's incredible,'' said Dr. Alvin Novick, a Yale Universiy biology professor
and co-founder of AIDS Project New Haven. ''It doesn't stop for a second.''

The two-year-old nonprofit organization consists of a paid coordinator and about
50 volunteers. Its programs depend on small grants and private donations. The
group offers a weeknight hot line, to which the number of calls has increased
steadily to about two dozen a night, said Eileen Becker Dunn, a research
associate at Yale Medical School who is the coordinator of the hot line.

She said her staff deals with a wide range of callers, from the ''worried well''
to AIDS patients, doctors, nurses and educators. A caller can even be given the
name of an undertaker who is sympathetic to the needs of the family of an AIDS
victim. ''We've had one funeral director in the area who refused to bury an AIDS
victim,'' she said.

Increased public concern about AIDS and the growing number of AIDS cases has
prompted the formation of other such projects in the state. The Hartford AIDS
Project, a division of the Hartford Gay Health Collective, was established three
months ago to provide counseling, screening and health care.

A Newtown physician, Dr. Donald T. Evans, has organized AIDS Project Greater
Danbury. The group works with the Danbury Hospital and the local visiting nurses
association to provide counseling and home health care for AIDS victims.

An AIDS patient, Gerard Wagner, and another Litchfield resident, Jeff McLeod
have operated the Northwestern Connecticut AIDS Project for two months out of
Mr. Wagner's kitchen ''on a shoestring,'' Mr. McLeod said.

''People in Litchfield County may think they're immune to such problems, but
they aren't,'' he said. ''There's a need for us here or the phone wouldn't ring
24 hours a day and the mail wouldn't pile up.''

The group sponsored an AIDS Awareness Week that started last Sunday in
Torrington with a panel discussion whose participants included Mr. Sabella and
Dr. Novick. The group is also producing a weekly program on a local cablevision
station. The program, titled Afraids, seeks to provide factual information about
the disease, Mr. McLeod said.

A 28-year-old Litchfield native, Mr. McLeod said he had become involved with the
AIDS project because ''when something like this touches your community, you have
to do something about it.'' Still, he occasionally suffers ''sneers and
remarks,'' and he said that at a recent speaking engagement ''people came in and
sat only in the back rows, as if I were contagious - by association.''

Mr. McLeod said that private regional AIDS projects like the one he is involved
with need more support from the state. ''We are the ones that have been doing
all the groundwork,'' he added, a sentiment shared by Dr. Novick.

''There are so many private people who are giving up their time and resources,''
Dr. Novick said. ''But we can never hope to cope fully with the need without
more assistance from the public sector. Though I'm disappointed that it took so
long for the state to come up with a plan to deal with the problem, I'm looking
forward to the possibility that its new program will be a productive one.''

Top 3 Trends Impacting the Global Ear-Based Hearing Aids Market Through 2021:
Technavio

LENGTH: 752  words


March 29 -- Technavio's latest market research report on the global ear-based
hearing aids market provides an analysis on the most important trends expected
to impact the market outlook from 2017-2021. Technavio defines an emerging trend
as a factor that has the potential to significantly impact the market and
contribute to its growth or decline.

Srinivas Sashidhar, a lead analyst from Technavio, specializing in research on
medical devices, says, "The highest contributor in the ear-based hearing aids
market are behind-the-ear hearing aids. However, it is expected that in-the-ear
hearing aids will gain popularity during the forecast period."

Technavio's sample reports are free of charge and contain multiple sections of
the report including the market size and forecast, drivers, challenges, trends,
and more.

The top three emerging market trends driving the global ear-based hearing aids
market according to Technavio heavy industry research analysts are:

* IT application-enabled devices are the next big trend

* 3D printing technology aid in the customization of new devices

* Launch of next-generation hearing aid devices

IT application-enabled devices are the next big trend

With the advancement in technology, the niche market of ear-based hearing aids
devices has seen a technological transformation. The latest technological
advancements in the product line are likely to improve the quality of living for
the people with hearing loss problems.

The technology update would help in improving the quality of life and
communication in patients. These ear-based hearing aid devices are developed and
modified to keep the patients in sync with the latest IT-powered world.

3D printing technology aid in the customization of new devices

3D printing technology is one of the oldest technologies being used in the
medical sector. This technology helped in easing the manufacturing process of
ear-based hearing aid devices. The audiologist scans the ear with the help of a
3D scanner, creating an ear impression with the use of lasers. This process
helps the customization of shells. In the early 2000s, Sonova was the first
company to use 3D technology to produce hearing aid devices. About 98% of the
hearing aid devices are manufactured using Stereo Lithography Printers or SLAs,
a type of 3D printer.

"WIDEX is one of the hearing aid companies that excels in 3D printed ear-based
hearing aids. The procedure involves constructing a three-dimensional image of a
patient's ear canal before the patient is provided a device," says Srinivas.

Launch of next-generation hearing aid devices

Lithium-ion chargeable hearing aid devices are the fastest growing and most
promising battery technology offering 40% enhanced power as compared to
conventional rechargeable batteries. The next generation hearing aid devices are
being launched in the market eliminating the conventional hearing aid devices.
Lithium-ion batteries are expected to last throughout the lifetime of a hearing
aid, even after repeated charging.

In 2016, Phonak, a global brand manufacturer of hearing instruments and wireless
communication solutions, announced the launch of next generation hearing aid
product platform Belong, which includes lithium-ion rechargeable battery
technology in hearing aids.

Similarly, in November 2016, WIDEX launched a new hearing aid called Beyond.
This receiver-in-the-ear (RITE) style ear-based hearing aid is expected to
provide the outstanding ability for hearing conversations in difficult listening
environments such as parties and restaurants. The device is compatible with
iPhone hearing aid and connect wirelessly to any Apple product for direct
streaming of phone calls and entertainment.

Wisconsin: July 1 general aid estimate released

LENGTH: 897  words

DATELINE: New York



 Madison: Department of Public Instruction, The state of Wisconsin has issue the
following news release:



 The $108.1 million bump in state general aid from Wisconsin's biennial budget
means 61 percent of school districts (260 of 424) will see an increase in state
aid for the 2016-17 school year, according to estimates released today by the
Department of Public Instruction.





 General aid -- made up of equalization aid also known as the school aid
formula, integration aid also known as Chapter 220 aid, and special adjustment
aid also known as hold harmless aid -- totals $4.584 billion for the
2016&#226;&#128;&#145;17 school year. The amount to be distributed to school
districts is up nearly $120 million because of changes in how the Independent
Charter School and Milwaukee Parental Choice programs are funded.



 General aid to school districts is paid in installments and is based on prior
year membership, shared costs, and property value. The July 1 aid estimates use
unaudited school district data and will be recalculated on audited 2015-16 data
and certified on Oct. 15. District aid estimates can be found on the
department's School Financial Services website, both alphabetically and by
percent change.



 Statewide pupil membership, counted as full-time equivalent (FTE) students
rather than enrollment, decreased by 29 FTE to 854,390 for
2015&#226;&#128;&#145;16, which is a smaller decline than in prior years. This
is because membership now includes students who resided in 142 districts who
were enrolled in the Wisconsin and Racine parental choice programs for 2015-16.
Payments to those voucher programs will be deducted from the general aid of
districts that have students enrolled in private choice schools for 2016-17:
$7,323 per full-time student in kindergarten through grade eight who enrolled
for the first time in the 2015-16 school year and $7,969 for each student
enrolled full-time in grade nine through 12. Additionally, all districts will
have 1.4 percent of their aid deducted, an estimated $63.9 million, to pay for
the 7,800 FTE pupils enrolled in 22 independent charter schools.



 Milwaukee Public Schools will have a state aid deduction estimated at $52.8
million to pay its new statutory share (25.6 percent) of the Milwaukee Parental
Choice Program (MPCP). Overall, that program is expected to total $206.1 million
for 27,500 FTE students attending private choice schools in Milwaukee for the
coming school year. General program revenue (GPR), state tax dollars, will pay
the remaining MPCP costs for 2016-17 and will increase by 3.2 percent each year
until GPR pays 100 percent of MPCP costs in 2024-25. Total general state aid to
be distributed to public school districts after deductions is $4,467,460,738.



 Shared costs per pupil, a main factor in the school aid formula, include the
operating and debt costs of a school district. Shared costs range from $22,523
in the North Lakeland (K8) School District in Manitowish Waters to $8,831 in the
Stanley-Boyd Area School District. The preliminary statewide average shared cost
per pupil for 2015-16 is $10,765.



 Changes in property valuations are another factor that impacts whether a
district receives more or less general state aid than the prior school year.
Property valuations per pupil range from $8,996,900 in North Lakeland to
$183,400 in Beloit, a ratio of 49:1 between the state's most and least property
wealthy districts. Beloit is the state's highest aided district, receiving state
general aid that covers 81.3 percent of its eligible shared costs. There are 20
districts that receive no equalization aid because their property wealth exceeds
$1.9 million per pupil. Most of these districts receive special adjustment aid,
which ensures that most aid decreases are held to no more than 15 percent from
year-to-year. Geneva J4, Mercer, North Lakeland, and Washington school districts
are estimated to receive no general aid for the 2016-17 school year.



 The Herman, Neosho, and Rubicon districts will consolidate on July 1, reducing
the number of public school districts across Wisconsin to 422. The three
districts will continue to appear separately in aid lists for
2016&#226;&#128;&#145;17 because aid calculations are based on prior year data.
The new district name will be the Herman-Neosho-Rubicon School District.



 State statute requires the department to compute an estimate of the general
school aid each public school district will receive for the coming school year
by July 1. School personnel use the estimate to complete their annual budgets.
On Oct. 15, the department will certify state general aid amounts for
2016&#226;&#128;&#145;17 based on audited 2015&#226;&#128;&#145;16 data.
Estimated general aid to districts may change.



 The department's July 1 aid estimate does not include per pupil categorical
aid, which is based on a three year average of Third Friday in September
membership. That aid is $250 per pupil, totaling $211.2 million, and will be
paid in March 2017. Per pupil aid is among a number of other categorical aids,
most of which restrict spending to a specific program or service, such as
special education and pupil transportation aid. More information can be found on
the Wisconsin Categorical Aid Programs website.

Seniors have options to save on hearing aids

BYLINE: By Jim MillerÂ  For The Oklahoman

SECTION: FEATURES; Pg. 21

LENGTH: 687 words


DEAR SAVVY SENIOR: Where can we find affordable hearing aids? My husband needs a
set, but we can't really afford to pay the exorbitant prices. Can you help us?-
Loud-Talking WifeDEAR LOUD: It's unfortunate, but millions of Americans with
hearing loss don't get hearing aids because they simply can't afford them.

Hearing aids -&nbsp;typically sold through audiologists' offices -&nbsp;are
expensive, usually costing $1,000 to $3,500 per ear. What's more, traditional
Medicare doesn't cover them, and private insurance typically hasn't, either.But
there are numerous ways to save on hearing aids if you know where to look. Here
are a few tips.Check your insuranceWhile most private health insurance companies
do not cover hearing aids, there are a few that do. United Healthcare, for
example, offers high-tech custom hearing aids to its beneficiaries through
HealthInnovations for $599 to $899 each.&nbsp; And a small number of other plans
will pitch in $500 to $1,000 toward the cost of hearing aids, or give you a
discount if you purchase hearing aids from a contracted provider.And due to
state law mandates, three states -&nbsp;Arkansas, New Hampshire and Rhode Island
-&nbsp;currently require private insurance companies to provide hearing aid
coverage for adults, and 20 require it for children. So check with your
insurance provider to see if it offers a hearing aid benefit.If your husband is
a Medicare beneficiary, you should know that while original Medicare (Part A and
B) and Medigap supplemental policies do not cover hearing aids, there are some
Medicare Advantage (Part C) plans that do. To look for a plan in your area that
covers hearing aids, go to&nbsp;Medicare.gov/find-a-plan.If he is a current or
retired federal employee enrolled in the Federal Employees Health Benefits
Program, some plans provide hearing aid coverage, including the Blue Cross Blue
Shield plan that covers hearing aids every three years up to $2,500.And, if you
are on Medicaid, most state programs cover hearing aids, but requirements vary.
To find out if he qualifies, contact your state's Medicaid program or go
to&nbsp;Medicaid.gov.Veterans benefitIf your husband is a veteran, Veterans
Affairs provides a hearing aid benefit if his hearing loss was connected to
military service or linked to a medical condition treated at a VA hospital.
He&nbsp;also can get hearing aids through the VA if his hearing loss is severe
enough to interfere with his activities of daily life. To learn more, call (877)
222-8387 or go to&nbsp;VA.gov.Assistance programsIf your income is low, there
are various programs and foundations that provide financial assistance for
hearing aids to people in need. Start by calling your state vocational
rehabilitation department (see parac.org/svrp.html) to find out if there are any
city, county or state programs or local civic organizations that could help.Also
contact Sertoma, at Sertoma.org or (816) 333-8300; this is a civic service
organization that offers a comprehensive list of state and national hearing aid
assistance programs on their website. Or call the National Institute on Deafness
and Other Communication Disorders at (800) 241-1044, and ask to be mailed its
list of financial resources for hearing aids.Cheaper optionsIf you are unable to
get a third party to help pay for your husband's hearing aids, you can still
save significantly by purchasing his hearing aids at Costco or online.Most
Costco stores sell top brands of hearing aids for 30 to 50 percent less than
other warehouse chains, hearing aid dealers or audiologists' offices. This
includes an in-store hearing aid test, fitting by a hearing aid specialist and
follow-up care.Also, websites such as EmbraceHearing.com and Audicus.com sell
quality hearing aids directly from the manufacturer for as little as $400 or
$500. But, he will need to get a hearing evaluation from a local audiologist
first, which can cost between $50 and $200.Send your senior questions to: Savvy
Senior, P.O. Box 5443, Norman, OK 73070, or visit SavvySenior.org. Jim Miller is

Health minister lists 4 AIDS fight challenges

SECTION: SOCIETY

LENGTH: 578 words


BEIJING - China is facing four new challenges in fighting HIV/AIDS, though the
nation has managed to roll back the rising trend of HIV infection, health
minister Chen Zhu said on Saturday, World AIDS Day.

More difficulties for HIV intervention, increasing risks of transmission,
growing demand for treatment funds, and inadequate capabilities among social
organizations are pressing matters, Chen said while participating in activities
raising awareness about AIDS.

Sex is the leading route for HIV transmission, and sex between men is on the
rise as a major cause of new HIV/AIDS infections in China. The ways of
transmission have become more concealed, which has brought greater difficulties
for HIV intervention, according to the minister.

It is estimated that nearly half of China's HIV carriers haven't yet been
discovered, as many with high sexual risk behaviors do not voluntarily seek HIV
tests or are not willing to receive tests for fear of being discriminated
against.

Chen warned that this large number of hidden HIV carriers leads to increasing
risks of HIV transmission.

While more HIV/AIDS cases are reported year on year, the number of patients
resistant to the usual drugs increases, he said. That raises growing demand for
varieties of HIV/AIDS drugs and increased funding for treatment.

Efforts are also needed to improve the capabilities of social organizations and
enhance their participation in AIDS control, said Chen.

In the past 10 years, China has made remarkable achievements in controlling the
spread of HIV/AIDS, curbing the diseases' rapid rise and keeping the overall
infection rate at a low level, Chen said.

"The mortality rate related to HIV/AIDS has decreased, and the living quality of
people with HIV/AIDS has significantly improved."

Under China's AIDS Action Plan for the 12th Five-Year Program period (2011-2015)
published this February by the State Council, the country is aiming to decrease
AIDS fatalities by 30 percent by 2015, and new cases by 25 percent as compared
to 2010.

According to figures from the Ministry of Health, China had reported a total of
492,191 cases of HIV/AIDS by the end of October, including 68,802 new cases this
year. Some 17,740 AIDS-related deaths were reported in the country from January
to October, a year-on-year increase of 8.6 percent.

"Social organizations are an important force to prevent and control the spread
of AIDS. The government is expected to improve its management of social
organizations and provide them with more instructions and help," said Zhang
Wenkang, chairman of the Chinese Association of STD/AIDS Prevention and Control.

Zhang, former health minister, urged the social organizations to improve their
capabilities and assist the government in the fight against AIDS.

They should actively implement government policies in this regard and do more
work in bottleneck areas of HIV/AIDS prevention and control, he urged.

A short film entitled "Be Together Forever" was released during the activities,
calling on people from all social strata to care for and help children affected
by HIV/AIDS and not to discriminate against those living with HIV/AIDS.

Peng Liyuan, a World Health Organization ambassador for the fight against AIDS
and a publicity representative of China's Health Ministry for AIDS control,
joined in Saturday's activities among 400 attendees representing the government,
social organizations at home and abroad, medical institutions, volunteers and
people with HIV/AIDS.

Malawi: Partnering For A Livelihoods Response To HIV/AIDS in Malawi

LENGTH: 502  words


Country: Malawi (View Country Profile)
Sector: MultiSector
Type: Development
Project Number: MWI018
The effects of HIV/AIDS in Malawi are both severe and long-term as households
and communities cope with the morbidity and mortality of their most productive
members.

The impacts of HIV/AIDS are further exacerbated by the deep-rooted poverty that
exists in a country. Although HIV/AIDS has a significant impact upon all
households, the effects of the epidemic especially impact impoverished families.
For these households, HIV/AIDS may not only mean a significant reduction in
assets, but the dissolution of the family unit itself.Promoting a holistic
understanding of HIV/AIDS as a livelihoods issue, not just a health problem,
requiring multi-sectoral program interventions at several levels, including
multi-sectoral community responses is very critical in the community response to
HIV/AIDS. The understanding of the linkages between HIV/AIDS and household
livelihoods will allow development NGOs, CBOs and government agencies to
determine the most effective program strategies, refocus program efforts, and
adapt health or even agricultural or micro-finance projects that include HIV/
AIDS mitigation goals and objectives into project design.From the perspective of
rural households in Malawi whose livelihoods have been devastated by the HIV/
AIDS pandemic, applying a livelihoods approach to program strategies and
activities is essential in order to first understand the multi-layered causes
and consequences of HIV/AIDS on their livelihoods and then subsequently devise
the most appropriate community response. Therefore the overall goal of the
Partnering for a Livelihoods Response To HIV/AIDS In Malawi project is to
contribute toward mitigating the long-term effects of HIV/AIDS in Malawi by
applying a livelihoods approach based on partnerships to HIV/AIDS programming
and policy. The major objectives of the project will be:
To develop programmatic and institutional capacity to improve the outcomes of
HIV/AIDS programming efforts of local HIV/AIDS networks, District AIDS
Committees (DACs) and F/CBOs by applying a livelihoods approach.
To increase financial resources (and technical support) availability to local
HIV/AIDS networks, District AIDS Committees (DACs) and F/CBOs to implement
multi-sectoral HIV/AIDS projects (and provide services) at the community level.
Activities that improve the ability of households and communities in Malawi to
cope with the HIV/AIDS epidemic are key in successfully mitigating the impact of
HIV/AIDS at a household and community level. Interventions that apply a
livelihoods approach may address the causes and effects of vulnerability and
poverty in relation to HIV/AIDS. Such interventions can be utilized with a
variety of entry points in order to reduce risk and increase livelihood options.
Whenever possible, preventive measures need to be linked to mitigation efforts
to ensure that both the causes and symptoms are being address

Foreign Aid policy silent on Aid for Trade

BYLINE: HIMALAYAN NEWS SERVICE

LENGTH: 443  words


KATHMANDU: Foreign Aid Policy is silent on mobilisation of Aid for Trade,
according to experts.

"The Foreign Aid Policy is silent on Aid for Trade mobilisation," said joint
secretary at the Ministry of Commerce and Supplies Chandra Ghimire, presenting
his paper during an interaction on 'Aid for Trade, LDCs and Nepal' here today in
the valley.

"Aid for Trade assisted programmes are also not mentioned in the budgetary Red
Book," he said, insisting on getting all the Aid for Trade assisted programmes
in Red Book in order to bring them under review.

"Even the ministry is not fully aware about the Aid for Trade and there is no
agency responsible specifically for it," Ghimire said. "There must also be
awareness and coordination among the private sectors including FNCCI, CNI, CoC
and Civil Society for Aid for Trade."

Nepal being a least developed country (LDC) has not yet seen any Aid for Trade
adjustment although the need is high. "Nepal needs Aid for Trade to develop its
trade and get market access," he said presenting his paper. There is also a huge
gap between Aid for Trade commitment and disbursement, he said, adding that the
country needs a huge investment and increased production as only market access
does not lead to increased exports of LDCs.

Though Nepal has gone into bilateral trade agreements with a number of
countries, its export sector still needs to be developed. "Nepal needs
investment and increased production and only Aid for Trade can help to reach
market."

According to an analysis, Aid for Trade has positive impact on export
performance as there is one per cent increment in Aid for Trade, exports will
see a growth by 0.224 per cent. "Aid for Trade is about assisting developing
countries to increase exports of goods and services to integrate into the
multilateral trading system to benefit from the liberalised trade and increase
market access.

Nepal is not in the list of top ten recipients of Aid for Trade countries,
whereas so did emerging countries like India, Iraq, Indonesia and Vietnam. "We
also do not have data base of the complete Aid for Trade assistance," he added.

Similarly, general secretary of SAWTEE, Ratnakar Adhikari insisted on formation
of National Monitoring Mechanism to monitor the Aid for Trade.

However, Aid for Trade has helped Nepal, according to president of Nepal
Economic Association Prof Dr Bishwambher Pyakurel. "Nobody recommends Aid for
Trade but it is assisting our country," he added.

"Nepal has a huge informal trade with India dominating the formal trade and
hurting the economy," he said. "There is also a huge gap between investment and
savings resulting in Balance of Payment deficit."

Rite Aid acquires;
Brooks stores

BYLINE: ANNE RAVANA OF THE NEWS STAFF

SECTION: Pg. A4

LENGTH: 616 words


Rite Aid Corp. announced Monday that it has acquired five Brooks stores in Maine
- including one each in Bangor and Brewer - as it becomes the largest drugstore
chain on the East Coast and the third-largest in the nation.

Rite Aid followed up on its August announcement that it would purchase the U.S.
Eckerd and Brooks operations of Canada's Jean Coutu Group Inc. for about $2.55
billion in cash and stock. In the end, Rite Aid acquired 1,854 Brooks and Eckerd
stores and six distribution centers in 18 East Coast and mid-Atlantic states.

Soon Rite Aid, based in Camp Hill, Pa., will operate 5,000 stores in 31 states
and the District of Columbia, including 83 stores in Maine. There were no Eckerd
stores in Maine for Rite Aid to acquire.

"This is a very exciting day for Rite Aid, and we are fortunate to have the
talented Brooks associates who work in Maine joining our team," Mary Sammons,
Rite Aid chairman, president and CEO, said in a prepared statement Monday. "We
look forward to enhancing the shopping experience at our new stores by bringing
the additional products, services and benefits Rite Aid offers."

Federal and state regulators required Rite Aid to divest 26 stores, all in East
Coast states, a number that was smaller than Rite Aid originally expected.

Rite Aid initially acquired Brooks stores in Bangor, Brewer, Waterville,
Gardiner, Freeport and Kittery, but the Federal Trade Commission required it to
sell the Brooks store in Gardiner to allow for fair market competition, Rite Aid
spokeswoman Jody Cook said in an interview Monday. Rite Aid sold the store to
The Medicine Shoppe, Cook said.

Maine Attorney General Steven Rowe applauded what his office termed the FTC's
"cooperative approach" to the investigation of Rite Aid's acquisition plans in
Maine.

"It is a partnership," he said. "The FTC provides important resources; our
office provides the knowledge of local markets."

Stores that are very close to one another, such as the Brooks and Rite Aid
stores on Union Street in Bangor, will be evaluated and one store may be closed,
Cook said. Fewer than 200 of the newly acquired 1,854 stores will close, she
said.

Rite Aid intends to offer jobs at the store that is retained or at a nearby Rite
Aid store to employees affected by a closure, she said.

"We absolutely intend to retain all associates," Cook said.

If a store is closed, the drug prescriptions on file will transfer to the store
that remains open, Cook said.

Brooks and Eckerd stores will be integrated into Rite Aid in phases, including
the installation of Rite Aid technology and a minor remodeling, including
upgraded decor and remerchandising. All stores are expected to be converted and
re-branded Rite Aid over the next 16 months.

Over the next several years, Rite Aid plans to spend $1 billion to fully remodel
almost all of the Brooks and Eckerd stores. The company will also continue its
new store development program with plans to open nearly 1,000 new and relocated
stores over the next five years.

Rite Aid said that among the changes customers would start to see shortly in the
former Brooks stores will be more nonpharmacy items for sale, including an
inexpensive Rite Aid private brand. In the next few months, customers ages 60
and above will also be able to sign up for Rite Aid's Living More senior loyalty
program, which provides special health and wellness benefits and discounts for
seniors.

With the now-completed acquisition of Brooks and Eckerd, Rite Aid has annual
revenues of more than $27 billion. The company is publicly traded on the New
York Stock Exchange under the symbol RAD.

Shares of Rite Aid closed up 19 cents at $6.55 in trading Monday.

Lynde Francis (Zimbabwe) Called Zimbabwe's "HIV miracle worker" in a New York
Sunday Times article last year.

Diagnosed 20 years ago and given three years to live, the British-educated
Francis was the first woman in Zimbabwe to go public with her HIV-positive
status. She started the first national support group from her living room.

Now called the Centre, it is an HIV/AIDS NGO and support organization for 4,500
HIV positive Zimbabweans. It is run by and for people living with HIV. The
centre is located in Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe.

Kecia Larkin: (Canada) A native AIDS activist, Larkin discovered she was
HIV-positive in 1989 at the age of 18 after living on the streets of Vancouver.

Originally from a small First Nations community on Vancouver Island, she
embarked on a quest to speak publicly about the disease in native communities
and to address the discrimination experienced by Aboriginals living with HIV/
AIDS.

Also starred in the documentary Kecia: Words to Live By, about her life and the
events that led to her testing positive. A mother of two, she now coordinates
national gatherings for Aboriginal people with HIV and is a member of the
community-based Red Road HIV/AIDS Network in B.C.

Veriano Terto (Brazil) An early champion of the AIDS movement in Brazil, Terto
is now an executive director at the Brazilian Interdisciplinary Association for
AIDS, the second-oldest AIDS organization in the country.

past 16 years has dedicated his time and effort in organizing the Brazilian AIDS
movement.

Terto, who has a master's degree in psychology and a PhD in collective health,
has long been a champion of social justice and universal access to HIV/AIDS
treatment.

He is also a social researcher and has written extensively on the Brazilian
homosexual population, social responses to HIV/AIDS and access to AIDS drugs in
Brazil.

Beatrice Were (Uganda) One of the first Ugandan women to speak out publicly
about her HIV-positive status. Infected by her first husband, she is an
outspoken critic of Uganda's adoption of the U.S. 'abstinence-until-marriage'
HIV prevention program.

She is national co-ordinator for HIV/AIDS at ActionAid Uganda and founder of the
National Community of Women Living with AIDS, a grassroots organization that
provides services to over 40,000 women in 20 districts of Uganda.

Irish aid among most effective, agency finds

BYLINE: Paul Cullen

SECTION: World; Other World Stories; Pg. 11

LENGTH: 357 words


IRELAND: Ireland boasts one of the highest-quality overseas aid programmes among
Western donors, according to a new report.

Almost 90 per cent of Irish aid is "real aid" that benefits poor people in
developing countries, the report by ActionAid finds.

In contrast, the agency accuses most Western countries of exaggerating their
generosity by including such items as administration, technical assistance and
debt relief in their official aid figures.

Such "phantom aid", as the agency describes it, accounts for two-thirds of aid
spending by wealthy countries. While this aid may achieve other goals, it does
not help to fight poverty, the report, Real Aid: An Agenda for Making Aid Work,
says.

ActionAid says the worst offenders are large donors such as the US and France,
where "phantom aid" accounts for more than 80 per cent of spending.

In 2003, official spending on aid by Western donors amounted to $69 billion, or
0.25 per cent of gross national income. However, ActionAid says $5 billion of
this money was not targeted at poverty reduction, almost $10 billion was
double-counted as debt relief, almost $14 billion comprised "overpriced and
ineffective" technical assistance and almost $3 billion was tied aid.

And it says another $11 billion in aid was poorly co-ordinated or too
unpredictable to be useful to the recipients or was spent on administration or
immigration-related costs.

"'Real' aid does real good, and we need much more of it," said ActionAid policy
officer Romilly Greenhill.

"The UN target is for donor countries to expend 0.7 per cent of their income on
aid, but shamefully the G7 countries are only one-tenth of the way to that
target when it comes to 'real' aid. If donors really want their aid to help
people, they need to reach the 'real' 0.7 per cent target by 2010 at the
latest."

The report finds that Ireland spends more of its aid (79 per cent) on low-income
countries than any other country apart from Portugal. In contrast, the US spends
only half its aid on these countries.

Ireland has no tied aid, whereas 70 per cent of US aid and 92 per cent of
Italian aid is tied.

Now hear this Technological advancements take hearing aids to a new level of
sound quality

BYLINE: Susan Stevens, Daily Herald Health Writer

SECTION: HEALTH & FITNESS; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 1507 words


When Douglas Moore built the pipe organ at Christ Lutheran Church in Vernon
Hills, he could tune all the notes by ear, up to the smallest pipes at the top.

Over the years the highest octave gradually went silent as his hearing
deteriorated. By his 66th birthday Moore's hearing loss had eroded into the
frequencies of human speech, and consonants and "s" sounds started dropping out.

"I couldn't tell the difference between 'cat' and 'bat,' because those occupy a
frequency I can no longer hear," said Moore, who lives in Vernon Hills. "It got
to the point I was saying 'excuse me' or 'Can you say that again?' so often it
got to be a pain.

As an engineer at Lowery Organ Co., Moore had a vested interest in good hearing.
He had already visited an audiologist four years earlier but was turned off by
the expense of hearing aids and a belief they wouldn't help much.

Moore wasn't alone. According to most surveys, only 20 percent of people with
hearing loss get hearing aids. Part of that is due to vanity, but a large part
is due to the very real limitations of the devices - evidenced by the hundreds
of hearing aids permanently relegated to the dresser drawer.

Meanwhile, large holiday gatherings leave the hard-of-hearing out in the cold,
often unable to communicate with their own grandchildren.

New technology could change all that. Now, hearing aids can dramatically improve
the ability to hear, even in challenging surroundings.

The noise factor

The primary complaint of those wearing hearing aids is excess noise. Older
hearing aids often disappointed because they amplified all sound; in a busy
restaurant, a hearing aid would make the voice of your sweetheart louder, but
she'd still have to compete with clanking silverware and the raucous party in
the next room.

Until recently, the only option for controlling that noise was turning down the
volume, leaving the hard-of-hearing in conversational oblivion. But new versions
are clearing some of those obstacles.

The best hearing aids today have several microphones that detect sound from
different directions. If you sit down in a busy restaurant, the microphone
facing your companion will increase in volume, while the others soften to muffle
background noise.

Newer aids make the transition automatically by honing in on the fluctuating
sound pattern of human speech.

Of all the improvements in hearing aids, audiologists say directional
microphones might be the most useful. Unless you are homebound, you face many
situations every day when you must hear clearly despite background noise.

"It's at grocery stores, it's at the shopping center, it's everywhere. You're
always trying to hear in background noise," said audiologist Linda Remensnyder
of Hearing Associates in Libertyville. "And research has shown these directional
microphones are mandatory to hear well in background noise."

Cutting feedback

For 30 years, Lara Colquhoun's pet peeve with every hearing aid she wore was the
feedback that resulted when she held a phone to her ear. As manager of a
doctor's office, she frequently removed her hearing aid altogether rather than
listen to the squeal.

Digital hearing aids - including Colquhoun's new Widex "Diva" hearing aids - can
identify the specific frequency of feedback and filter it out before it reaches
the person's ear.

"That really works, too," she said. "It's just like normal hearing."

Feedback occurs when some of the amplified sound leaks out and enters the
hearing aid's microphone. A tight fit can prevent such leaks, but that also
produces a plugged-up feeling and can distort the sound of the wearer's own
voice.

The best digital hearing aids take care of feedback automatically, just as they
adjust for volume and noise control.

That's an important improvement for patients who have trouble manipulating the
tiny switches on hearing aids, or who don't want to fiddle with a device.

"It just draws attention to you that you don't really want," Colquhoun said.
"You don't want people to look at you."

More frequencies

The shift to digital hearing aids - which represent more than 80 percent of
today's market - also brought a huge increase in the operational power of
hearing aids.

"We still do some analog hearing aids, but even the low-end technology today is
digital," said Mary Cay Chisholm, an audiologist and director of the Northwest
Speech and Hearing Center in Arlington Heights. "There's a lot of advantages to
a digital chip."

The new hearing aids come with various settings; one program might be for quiet
conversations, another for noisy environments, another for listening to music or
talking on the telephone. Some hearing aids can amplify soft sounds more than
loud ones.

The latest hearing aids hold more than a dozen processors to amplify specific
ranges of sound, down to one-third of an octave. Even those that split the
frequency range into just three sections allow for a much better fit than older,
less versatile models, in which all frequencies were amplified the same amount.

Most people have a slope to their hearing loss, which often is more severe in
higher frequencies, Chisholm said.

For patients with the most profound hearing loss, some hearing aids can even
translate high frequencies into lower tones that are easier to hear. That can
help a person understand speech even though the sound will be somewhat
distorted.

Six-year-old Shannon Hurlbut of Lake Villa got two aids by Sonovation in
October. The next morning her mother found her in the bathroom, listening to the
new sound of water trickling out of the faucet.

More important, said her mother, Diana Hurlbut, is how the hearing aids enable
Shannon to learn to read and hear speech - including her own name.

"The 'sh' in her name is a sound she probably struggles to hear," Diana Hurlbut
said. "With these new hearing aids, I'm hoping she can hear that sound much
better."

State of the art

When Moore returned to the audiologist this September he was impressed enough
with the new technology to buy a top-of-the-line hearing aid from Oticon, a
major hearing aid manufacturer.

It took some getting used to. After years of hearing loss, Moore's brain had to
relearn which sounds to pay attention to, which to ignore. But now, he says, he
hears "the whole orchestra" again - including notes in the upper octaves. He can
have a conversation with his wife in a busy restaurant, and is hearing sounds
for the first time in years.

"One night I was sitting in the backyard and all of a sudden I heard a cricket,"
he said. "I had forgotten what they sounded like."

More improvements are around the corner. Robert Sweetow, director of audiology
at the medical center of University of California, San Francisco, expects more
hearing aids to emerge with "instant fit" rather than the traditional two- to
three-week wait.

"Manufacturers recognize this is a definite potential improvement," Sweetow
said. "Right now there are three or four instant-fit hearing aids, and within
six months I believe there will be close to 10."

Other hearing aids are being developed with air holes, which make them more
comfortable to wear and reduce distortion of the wearer's own voice.

Hearing aids in general are getting smaller, including some versions that are
virtually invisible. However, the smallest aids that hide within the ear canal
typically do not have some of the most effective features, such as directional
microphones.

Even though hearing aids are better today than ever, they still have limits.

Directional microphones - often lauded as the biggest improvement - have proved
effective in reducing background noise, but have trouble in environments with
reverberation, such as auditoriums, gyms or some other large rooms, said Joe
Smaldino, professor of audiology at Northern Illinois University.

Similarly, new hearing aids are good at canceling out noises like the hum of a
dishwasher, but less effective when the noise is closer to human speech - such
as extraneous crowd sounds.

It's also unclear how much benefit you gain from a high number of frequency
bands, Smaldino said. It makes intuitive sense that adjusting 16 separate
frequencies will lead to better hearing, but studies have shown only limited
improvements as more channels are added.

"The jury is still out," Smaldino said. "We had one hearing aid with 30
channels, but it was just too much to adjust. In terms of just trying to get the
person a pretty good fit, I think most people would say three channels is
enough."

It might come down to the audiologist's skill and familiarity with the brand,
Smaldino said.

Audiologists say they like having more channels, and that they can tell a
difference in their patients' hearing.

Whatever their features, hearing aids cannot restore perfect hearing. At best,
they can enable the hard-of-hearing to participate more fully in life, whether
that means hearing their grandchildren at Christmas or cicadas in the summer.

Audiologists say they're hearing more success stories these days.

"Hearing aids were so bad before, I was thinking of leaving the field,"
Remensnyder said. "Now I can really help people hear."

the least visible. They lack the power and some special features of larger aids.
In-the-canal hearing aids protrude slightly into the outer ear. In-the-ear
hearing aids are larger and can hold more features, but like smaller aids may
have problems with feedback and wax buildup. Behind-the-ear hearing aids, like
this translucent model, offer the most power and special features like dual

Message on AIDS fails to hit home

BYLINE: The plight of a woman left to fend for herself because home-help
agencies are refusing to deliver food to AIDS victims has lent new irony to the
old maxim ''charity begins at home''. JOE RAYE reports.

SECTION: AGENDA; Pg. 14

LENGTH: 1096 words


THE more you know about AIDS, the less the risk: this is the message the
Government has been trying to make public. But somehow it has been lost on many
of the territory's welfare services, leading to discrimination.

The problem was highlighted this month by the case of a 63-year-old Kowloon AIDS
sufferer. The woman returned home after a period in Queen Elizabeth Hospital
only to find home-help workers would not deliver meals to her for fear of
contracting the disease.

Of the territory's 19 publicly-funded agencies running home-help programmes, 16
refuse to serve AIDS patients. The other three are prepared to provide at least
some services, although none have yet been asked.

AIDS patients have also not been admitted to the territory's nine hospices.
Bradbury, Hong Kong's only private hospice, accepts only cancer patients. The
eight Hospital Authority hospices, which offer about 120 beds, are also
dedicated almost exclusively to cancer sufferers.

And though there are still relatively few full-blown AIDS cases in the
territory, the problem is set to grow with authorities reporting a significant
rise in the number of patients this year.

''We certainly see no danger to the staff in the normal circumstances of their
work, so we don't feel we're putting them at risk at all,'' said Thomas Mulvey,
executive director of the Hong Kong Welfare Society, one of two agencies willing
to provide complete services to AIDS patients. ''But because of the
scare-mongering that has gone on, we would want to choose the home-help workers
who would feel able to take on the work without so much anxiety.''

Lai Ting-siu, director of the Chan Hing Social Services Centre, said his
agency's lack of liability insurance was one reason it only provided escort
services for AIDS patients. ''It's very difficult to prove (if a) worker got
AIDS from work or from other sources,'' Mr Lai said. ''If one of our workers
sues, who is going to pay for the compensation?''

Liu Chun-keung, a spokesman for the Social Welfare Department, said: ''At the
moment, our home-help service has not been extended to cover AIDS patients
because of misunderstandings by concerned workers who are reluctant to handle
such patients. We don't want to force them to offer assistance because it will
attract resistance.''

Mr Liu was referring to the case of the Kowloon woman who needed meals delivered
during the day while her family was at work.

''The home-help workers had initially agreed to take the meals, but when they
found out she was HIV positive, they weren't willing,'' said Dr Patrick Li
Chung-ki of Queen Elizabeth Hospital's department of medicine. ''There's a lack
of information among the front-line workers. It's up to the people in charge to
try to correct those misconceptions. Just delivering a meal to an AIDS patient
wouldn't pose a hazard because the disease is not highly infectious.''

The Kowloon woman contracted AIDS from her husband, a sailor who died of the
disease five years ago. Bedridden on some days because she is too weak to walk,
she has lost two kilograms in less than 10 days.

''The workers are over-worried about contacting AIDS carriers,'' said the
woman's 30-year-old son, who shares a flat with his wife, mother, brother and
young son. ''They could deliver the meals in disposable containers. They are not
required to feed my mother.''

The Social Welfare Department is planning AIDS training courses for home-help
workers, but no date has been set, Mr Liu said. ''After appropriate training, I
think we will be able to provide this kind of service to AIDS patients. If we
can't, then people have a right to complain. But this is hypothetical at this
stage.''

Independent AIDS spokesman Mike Sinclair, an AIDS sufferer himself, said
authorities would have to ''take a firm line'' on the issue since previous
educational talks by AIDS activists have had little effect on home-helpers.

''They listen politely, thank us for the work and then simply refuse to have
anything to do with an AIDS patient,'' said Mr Sinclair. ''There's a very big
barrier of ignorance and, beyond that, prejudice. There's still this
superstitious dread about diseases in general and AIDS in particular.''

ALTHOUGH denying home-help care and other services to AIDS sufferers currently
affects few people, this is set to change with the number of AIDS patients in
Hong Kong is increasing by more than 20 per cent a year.

Hong Kong's first case of HIV infection was identified in 1985, although the
disease only began to take hold in the late 1980s, said Dr Lee Shui-shan, a
consultant to the Department of Health and a member of the AIDS Advisory
Council. Half of all those who test HIV positive will develop AIDS within 10
years, according to the World Health Organisation.

''We are about to see a steady increase in the number of AIDS patients diagnosed
in Hong Kong,'' said Dr Lee. ''The first wave of people who contracted HIV in
Hong Kong are now getting AIDS.''

According to Department of Health statistics, 63 people died of the disease here
last year, more than three times the number in 1990. There were 115 AIDS cases
and 480 people infected with HIV at the end of August, a three-fold increase in
five years.

But actual AIDS cases could be two or three times higher, according to Dr Lee.
And as many as 4,000 to 7,000 people could be infected with HIV.

As the number of full-blown sufferers grows, so will the demand for care.
Sister Maureen McGinley, a volunteer for AIDS Concern hotline, said hospice care
might be a solution and said she was considering setting up one for AIDS
patients. ''These (the existing hospices) are units that were dedicated to
people who had cancer,'' she said. ''Now we have AIDS patients who need
palliative care but the admission criteria has not changed.

''I think part of it is the fear of HIV and AIDS. They don't know how to deal
with it. They think they need special resources or special equipment, but you
don't. They say the staff isn't trained. That's true, they're not. At the
moment, they don't have to be. But if the staff is ready and willing, it's easy
enough to train them.''

But overall, there is some hope on the horizon. Dr Li, of the Queen Elizabeth
Hospital, said the Government's anti-discrimination legislation, to be
introduced early next year, might help AIDS patients gain equal access to
publicly funded services.

''Once the bill is passed, this will probably be considered a discriminatory
act,'' he said. ''They can't hide away from the problem forever.''

Public, Private Sector AIDS Prevention Ties Planned

SECTION: Pg. 2

LENGTH: 412 words


The Health and Welfare Ministry will establish an AIDS countermeasures promotion
headquarters within the ministry by the end of October, to promote coordination
with private-sector groups.

The headquarters, to be led by administrative vice minister Takehiro Kuroki,
will promote joint public-private sector AIDS prevention projects, and
strengthen ministry facilities for AIDS testing, treatment and research,
officials said.

In August, the ministry asked for 10.28 billion yen in its fiscal 1993 budget
for its "AIDS Stop Campaign" that includes free AIDS examinations at health
insurance clinics and establishment of core hospitals specializing in AIDS
treatment.

In recent weeks, however, ministry officials alarmed by the rapid rise in AIDS
cases decided to bring part of this budget forward into the current fiscal year,
and specifically determined to promote establishment of AIDS prevention programs
at the private-sector level before the end of the year, to include
representatives of business, labor and the media.

They also decided to ask prefectural governments to establish their own AIDS
countermeasure committees, to install AIDS examination equipment at all health
insurance clinics around the country and to provide private consultation rooms
for AIDS sufferers.

The money for these expanded programs is to come from the supplementary budget
to be considered in the Diet later this fall, and will be coordinated by the
ministry's AIDS countermeasures promotion headquarters.

One senior ministry official said, "We want to show the people how determined
the government is in taking countermeasures to AIDS."

According to a survey by the ministry's AIDS Surveillance Committee, more than
100 new cases of AIDS diseases and infections were discovered in Japan in the
months of July and August, a new record for a two-month period. The total of new
cases so far this year is already 326, more than the total number (238 people)
discovered all last year.

The incidence of AIDS acquired from heterosexual contact is rising, and AIDS
victims are younger and from a broader spectrum of prefectures around Japan than
before, committee sources said.

Worried about a potential explosion in AIDS cases, Tokyo on Thursday became the
first prefectural government to institute an AIDS Countermeasures Office. More
such offices at the local government and corporate level are expected to appear
in the next few weeks, ministry sources said.

PHYSICIANS WITH AIDS DOCTORS' RIGHT TO PRIVACY COLLIDES WITH PATIENTS' RIGHT; TO
KNOW

BYLINE: Roger Signor Post-Dispatch Science-Medicine Editor

SECTION: WAR PAGE; Pg. 1B

LENGTH: 1739 words


AN ESTIMATED doctors and dentists in Missouri and Illinois have AIDS. At
leasttwo are surgeons. Few people know who they are. And whether these
professionals inform their patients about their conditions or continue to
practice is entirely up to them.  Neither state nor federal law requires them to
disclose that they are carriers of a deadly disease.  And no law prevents
physicians and dentists from operating on a patient where it is conceivable,
though unlikely, that they could transmit the disease.  This is beginning to
make a lot of people nervous - especially in light of several highly publicized
cases. Some of the stories are about patients infected by surgeons or dentists,
others conce rned professionals who disclosed their illnesses to patients after
treatment.  As Charles J. Kratovil of south St. Louis puts it: ''If a surgeon
can inflict a mortal wound in me, I sure as hell would want to know.'' Views
like Kratovil's are shaping a national debate over whether doctors and dentists
infected with AIDS should be compelled to reveal their conditions to patients.
The debate is taking place in something of a vacuum. The Center for Disease
Control, considered the nation's leading public health authority on AIDS, has
not taken a position on the issue, saying it needs more study.  But others are
choosing sides: Both the American Medical Association and the American Dental
Association say that doctors with AIDS should refrain from doing surgery on
patients - or should tell their patients of their condition.  Dr. George M.
Bohigian is an ophthalmologist in St. Louis and is this area's delegate to the
American Medical Association. Bohigian says, ''The physician has at least a
moral responsibility to report to patients that he has AIDS.'' But the president
of the St. Louis Effort For AIDS, Woody Bebout, says such reports are
unnecessary because of the minuscule risk of doctors giving the disease to their
patients.  The AMA and the Missouri State Medical Association would like to see
a law that gives doctors authority to test patients for the AIDS virus. The same
organizations say testing of doctors should be voluntary.  No group currently is
pushing for laws to make doctors tell patients if they have AIDS.  In fact, some
doctors say that it may not be good medicine to tell Kratovil or any patient
whether his doctor has AIDS. The knowledge would frighten patients unnecessarily
and serve only to put the confessing doctor out of business, they say.  The best
approach, they say, is for surgeons and dentists with AIDS to voluntarily stop
doing surgery.  ''It's a very uncommon event to transmit AIDS (during surgery
and happens only under special conditions,'' said Dr. Gerald Medoff co-director
of infectious disease at Washington University Medical School. ''If I were doing
surgery (and had AIDS, I'd feel more comfortable doing something else - instead
of telling everyone I had AIDS,'' Medoff said.  Others take a more stringent
view. They advocate reciprocal doctor-patient disclosure about whether either
party has AIDS or has been infected by the virus that causes it.  ''If doctors
knew that they had AIDS, then they should have told their patients,'' said Dr.
Newton B. White, St. Louis County orthopedic surgeon and president of the St.
Louis Metropolitan Medical Society.  In agreement with White is Dr. James
McGivney, Affton dentist and member of the Missouri Dental Board, the state
agency that licenses dentists. Any doctor with AIDS who does surgery ''has a
moral duty to inform patients, thereby giving them the opportunity to give their
consent for invasive procedures, '' McGivney said.  The issue arose last year
when the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reported that a Florida dentist, Dr.
David Acer, was found to have infected three of his patients with the disease.
In September, Acer wrote his patients he had AIDS - two days before he died.
''Until then, it was assumed that (federal guidelines on preventive measures
made it virtually impossible to transmit the AIDS virus,'' from doctor to
patient, he said.  The Florida incident by itself stirred little reaction among
health care consumers. But discussion intensified after the patients of several
other doctors with AIDS learned about it second-hand.  Among the cases: A Kansas
City dentist, Paul E. Gray, died of AIDS in April; he had stopped seeing
patients earlier this year, but it is unclear whether he told patients of his
illness.  An advanced dental student in clinical training at the Medical College
of Georgia, Augusta, Ga., treated 163 clinical patients before he told school
officials in November last year that he had AIDS.  A Baltimore cancer surgeon,
Rudolph Almaraz, died of AIDS in November; neither his patients nor Johns
Hopkins University Hospital, where he did much of his surgery, knew of his
illness until his death.  At the two medical centers, hospital officials
voluntarily are contacting patients and offering them counseling and testing for
AIDS. Gray was not associated with a hospital and no effort is being made to
contact his patients, health officials say.  Three years ago, a student at
Washington University's School of Dental Medicine was forbidden to work in the
school's clinic after officials found that he carried the AIDS virus. The school
tested 27 patients seen by the unidentified student. He later sued the school,
saying its officials had breached medical confidentiality and an invasion of his
privacy.  In such cases, there are no state or federal laws requiring hospitals,
health departments or individual doctors to contact or test patients of doctors
i nfected with AIDS.  Nor does Missouri law require doctors to notify patients
that they have AIDS, said Dr. Todd Baumgartner, epidemiologist for the state
health department.  But state law does require that patients disclose whether
they've been infected with AIDS before they get treatment from a doctor, he
said.  Illinois law does not require either patient or doctor to inform one
another about having been infected by the AIDS virus.  AIDS, or acquired immune
deficiency syndrome, is caused by a virus that attacks the body's immune system,
destroying its ability to fight infections.  The virus is spread by close
contact with blood, blood products or semen from infected persons.  The blood
loss inherent in major operations - creating the parallel risk of accidental
AIDS infection - has concerned health care workers for years.  A common example
might be a surgeon who nicks himself with a scalpel thereby exposing his blood
to the patient's.  ''In the operating room, a surgeon's bloodstream is exposed
to a patient's (bloodstream, especially during major sur gery, such as on the
abdomen and chest,'' said Dr. Daniel F. O'Sullivan, surgeon and past president
of the St.  Louis Metropolitan Medical Society.  So, not surprisingly, Johns
Hopkins Hospital officials were alarmed when they learned from a newspaper story
that one of their cancer surgeons had died of AIDS. There's no evidence yet that
the surgeon infected any patient, according to a hospital spokesman.  But Dr.
Hamilton Moses III, vice president at Johns Hopkins Hospital, has asked the CDC
for new guidelines on how to better control doctor-to-patient transmission of
AIDS.  ''What health policy exists is hopelessly vague,'' Moses wrote the
agency.  He also asked whether doctors, nurses or other health care workers
should tell their employers or patients whether they are infected with the AIDS
virus.  Given the limited evidence on the subject, the CDC cannot now recommend
that doctors inform patients that they have AIDS, or whether an investigation
should be done each time a dentist or surgeon dies from the disease, says Dr.
Harold Jaffe, deputy director of the agency's AIDS division.  However, Jaffe
said his agency has updated guidelines for medical procedures to prevent AIDS
transmission. These recommendations have been sent to the U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services for final action or revision, he said.  ''We've always
assumed that there would be some risk of health care workers transmitting AIDS
to patients,'' though that risk is slight, Jaffe said in a telephone interview.
For a surgeon with AIDS, the odds of infecting a patient runs between 1 chance
in 41,667 up to 1 chance in 416,667. For a dentist, it is 1 chance in 263,158 up
to 1 chance in 2,631,579, according to the CDC.  The odds on AIDS transmission
have an extremely wide range because there's such limited data on such
infections.  A rough guide on the eventual rate of AIDS being transmitted by
health workers to patients can be gleaned from experience with another viral
disease, hepatitis B, Jaffe said. That virus is transmitted in the same way that
the AIDS is, he said.  Since the early 1970s - when it was first possible to
detect hepatitis B in the blood - about 300 patients have been infected with the
hepatitis virus by health care workers, he said.  Chances are slight that your
physician or dentist has AIDS, according to nationwide reports of health care
workers who have had the disease.  Since AIDS was made a reportable disease in
1981, about 6,000 workers in the health care field have had AIDS or died from
it, a CDC spokesman said.  Most of these workers, who include administrators,
have little contact with patients.  A breakdown of health workers who may or may
not do invasive procedures on patients includes: 703 physicians, 43 surgeons,
171 dental workers, 1,358 nurses, 1,101 health aides, 941 technicians, 319
therapists and 116 paramedics, the CDC spokesman reported.  Of the official
total, two surgeons and five dentists were from Illinois, health officials there
say. In Missouri, ''a total of 13 dentists or physicians with AIDS have been
reported to the health department,'' a state health official said. He said he
had no breakdown on the number of individual surgeons and dentists with AIDS.
Leaders of AIDS advocacy groups here urge people not to panic over reports of
doctors with AIDS.  ''Most patients have nothing to fear from their doctors
because the vast majority of procedures aren't invasive,'' said Bebout, of St.
Louis Effort for AIDS. Bebout does not believe doctors need to tell patients
whether they have AIDS.  ''But it is an issue if doctors do invasive surgery.
They then have to make a decision whether they can in good conscience risk being
cut during a procedure.''

Militant tactics by AIDS groups   dramatize frustration with crisis   Mass
'die-in' staged to mark loss of lives to disease

BYLINE: DEBORAH WILSON; GAM

LENGTH: 925 words

DATELINE: Vancouver BC


BY DEBORAH WILSON
British Columbia Bureau
  VANCOUVER
Office workers and shoppers were milling through a pleasant downtown
square one recent rush hour when people began to collapse around them.

The dramatized "die-in" of about 150 AIDS activists at Robson Square
was the first appearance of the newly created AIDS Coalition To Unleash
Power, a group whose U.S. counterparts have generated headlines with their
militant tactics to agitate for improvements in AIDS treatment.

The group's emergence in British Columbia, the province with the
highest rate of aquired immune deficiency syndrome, marks a turning point
in the affected community's response to the health crisis that is now
entering its second decade, and a frustration with both the government and
medical establishment.

It also marks a dissatisfaction with the state of existing grassroots
organizations concerned with the AIDS epidemic, which now has affected
more than 4,000 Canadians.

ACT-UP spokesman Kevin Robb said the group is a sign of "frustration
that we've been dealing with this disease for 10 years now and we're still
so far from where we should be.

"It should be a chronic, manageable disease like diabetes, but there's
still people dying," Mr. Robb, a Vancouver lawyer who is infected with the
human immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS, said in an interview.

Civil disobedience by ACT-UP's U.S. counterparts have included a widely
criticized "die-in" during mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York
last December, disruption of the International Conference on AIDS in San
Francisco in June, pickets and telephone harassment. But the U.S. ACT-UP
groups, which have criticized less militant AIDS organizations as for
people who "wear suits and are polite," have been credited with forcing
improvements in AIDS treatment, such as lower costs for the anti-viral
drug AZT.

While ACT-UP staged its Vancouver die-in in response to lives lost by
alleged government inaction, the group's co-founder, David Lewis, was at
home, sick and preoccupied by his own rapidly approaching death.

Mr. Lewis says he plans to end his life within days to avoid a
lingering, painful descent into dementia and death. But he says he exits
with bitterness over the drift that he perceives in AIDS organizations,
particularly the Persons With AIDS society that he helped create, away
from being a coalition of people "empowering" other people with AIDS.

"Right now that group is run by heterosexual and HIV-negative people
who are tokenistic towards people with AIDS," Mr. Lewis said in an
interview at his modest house on the west side of Vancouver.

He said ACT-UP was formed in frustration over the new conservatism of
the Persons With AIDS Society, and some members of the new group wanted to
picket the PWA office as their first public act.

Alex Kowalski, chairman of the Persons With AIDS Society, said that Mr.
Lewis's allegations are not true, although he acknowledged that the
society is in a period of transition, with volunteer activity falling off
and a reluctance to engage in political activism for fear of jeopardizing
government assistance with its budget of more than $500,000.

He said the organization is also changing because of the evolution of
the AIDS crisis, in which there are so many more affected people, and so
few prospects for dramatic new treatments in the near future.

"It's not the same intimate sort of fun place it was and I think that's
because of the growth," Mr. Kowalski said.

Mr. Robb said that ACT-UP members intend to agitate for wider testing
and better access to new AIDS drugs, elimination of the social stigma that
surrounds AIDS, and help to ease the impoverishment that accompanies AIDS-
related illness.

With an estimated 30,000 to 50,000 Canadians currently infected by the
human immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS, scientists are forecasting
that the number of AIDS cases - people who have developed the disease or
died from it - will increase to as many as 12,890 by 1993 from its Aug. 7
total of 4,425.

More than a dozen federal studies are currently under way to track the
exposure of different population groups to the virus. But there are not
yet in Canada the frightful statistics that are cropping up in the United
States, which show AIDS to be increasingly an inner-city disease,
affecting black and Hispanic men and women.

In Canada, homosexual men remain overwhelmingly the victims of AIDS.
Dr. Michael O'Shaughnessy, acting director-general of the Federal Centre
for AIDS in Ottawa, said the long incubation period of the virus means
that AIDS may not begin turning up in large numbers in other population
groups for several years.

Bonnie Fox-McIntyre, a spokeswoman for the federal Department of Health
and Welfare, said the complaints of lagging research and testing in Canada
are unfounded. "The government is making every effort to make sure we're
at the forefront of providing access to drugs, keeping in mind that the
trials that are allowed be safe."

But one health-care official involved in AIDS treatment, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said that buck-passing between federal and
provincial governments and a lack of financial commitment is holding up
advancement in AIDS care. Progress is also hindered by the divisions drawn
between AIDS research, which is a federal responsibility, and treatment,
which the province pays for, the official said.

Although British Columbia is expected to release a long-awaited AIDS
strategy next month, it remains the only province that refuses to pay for
AZT, the anti-viral drug that is currently the only widely accepted
treatment to delay the progress of AIDS.

Fewer than 10 of 300 show exposure to AIDS

BYLINE: MARGARET L. USDANSKY

SECTION: CITRUS TIMES; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 455 words

DATELINE: INVERNESS



INVERNESS - Fewer than 10 of about 300 people tested for AIDS by the    Citrus
County Health Department showed signs of exposure to the    disease, the
department's director announced Monday.

     None of those tested had developed AIDS (acquired immune deficiency
syndrome), a fatal disease that cripples the body's immune system,    County
Health Director Shakra Junejo said in a prepared statement.

     "Citrus County doesn't have a 'case' of AIDS yet," Junejo said.

 The health department began voluntary, confidential AIDS testing and
counseling last August.

     People who test positive for AIDS have been exposed to the disease    and
can transmit it but may not show any symptoms of the disease.

     AIDS is transmitted through sexual activity and the sharing of
contaminated needles.

     Since 1980, county health departments throughout Florida have    reported a
total of 3,303 cases of AIDS, and 64 percent of those    stricken with the
disease have died, according to figures from the    state's AIDS program office.


     Marion County has reported 10 AIDS cases to the state. Levy County    has
reported two cases, and Hernando County has reported six.

     Citrus and Sumter counties are among 19 of Florida's 67 counties    that
have not reported any AIDS victims among their residents.

     Only full-blown cases of AIDS are reported to the state. Cases in    which
people test positive for the AIDS virus or show symptoms of its    precursor,
AIDS Related Complex (ARC), are not reported.

     "At this point, only full-blown AIDS is a reportable disease,"    said
Karen Hastings, state program manager for AIDS Information and    Education.

     Hastings said doctors are not required to report ARC cases to the    state
because this stage of the disease is difficult to define.

 Reporting patients who test positive for AIDS but show no symptoms of    the
disease would not accurately reflect the number of people who have    been
exposed to AIDS, Hastings said, because many people don't realize    they have
been exposed and don't seek testing.

     For every documented case of AIDS, 10 more people are thought to    have
ARC and 50 more are thought to have been exposed to the disease,    according to
officials.

     The Citrus County Health Department offers free educational classes    on
AIDS every Wednesday from 1 to 2 p.m. at 120 Montgomery St. in    Inverness.

     Anyone seeking information about the department's AIDS classes or
testing should call 726-1731.

How to save on hearing aids;
SAVVY SENIOR

BYLINE: Edmonds Beacon staff

LENGTH: 683  words


Dear Savvy Senior, Where can we find affordable hearing aids? My husband needs a
set, but we can't really afford to pay the exorbitant prices. Can you help us?

Loud-Talking Wife

Dear Loud

It's unfortunate, but millions of Americans with hearing loss don't get hearing
aids because they simply can't afford them. Hearing aids -- typically sold
through audiologists' offices -- are expensive, usually costing between $1,000
to $3,500 per ear. What's more, traditional Medicare doesn't cover them and
private insurance typically hasn't either.

But there are numerous ways to save on hearing aids if you know where to look.
Here are a few tips. Check your insurance While most private health insurance
companies do not cover hearing aids, there are a few that do. United Healthcare,
for example, offers hightech custom hearing aids to their beneficiaries through
Healthmnovations for $599 to $899 each.

And a small number of other plans will pitch in $500 to $1,000 toward the cost
of hearing aids, or give you a discount if you purchase hearing aids from a
contracted provider.

And due to state law mandates, three states -- Arkansas, New Hampshire and Rhode
Island -- currently require private insurance companies to provide hearing aid
coverage for adults and 20 require it for children. So check with your insurance
provider to see if it offers a hearing aid benefit.

If your husband is a Medicare beneficiary, you should know that while original
Medicare (Part A and B) and Medigap supplemental policies do not cover hearing
aids, there are some Medicare Advantage (Part C) plans that do. To look for a
plan in your area that covers hearing aids visit www.medicare.gov/find-a-plan.

If he is a current or retired federal employee enrolled in the Federal Employees
Health Benefits Program, some plans provide hearing aid coverage, including the
Blue Cross Blue Shield plan that covers hearing aids every three years up to
$2,500.

And, if you are on Medicaid, most state programs cover hearing aids, but
requirements vary. To find out if he qualifies, contact your state's Medicaid
program or visit www.medicaid.gov. Veterans benefit

If your husband is a veteran, the VA provides a hearing aid benefit if his
hearing loss was connected to military service or linked to a medical condition
treated at a VA hospital.

He can also get hearing aids through the VA if his hearing loss is severe enough
to interfere with his activities of daily life. To learn more, call
1-877-222-8387 or visit www.va.gov.

Assistance programs

If your income is low, there are various programs and foundations that provide
financial assistance for hearing aids to people in need.

Start by calling your state vocational rehabilitation department (see
www.parac.org/svrp.html) to find out if there are any city, county or state
programs, or local civic organizations that could help.

Also contact Sertoma (www.sertqma.org, 1-816-333-8300), a civic service
organization that offers a comprehensive list of state and national hearing aid
assistance programs on their website. Or call the National Institute on Deafness
and Other Communication Disorders at 1-800-241-1044, and ask them to mail you
their list of financial resources for hearing aids.

Cheaper buying options If you are unable to get a third party to help pay for
your husband's hearing aids, you can still save significantly by purchasing his
hearing aids at Costco or online.

Most Costco stores sell top brands of hearing aids for 30 to 50 percent less
than other warehouse chains, hearing aid dealers or audiologists' offices. This
includes an in-store hearing aid test, fitting by a hearing aid specialist and
follow-up care.

And websites like www.embracehearing.com, and www.audicus.com sell quality
hearing aids directly from the manufacturer for as little as $400 or $500. But,
he will need to get a hearing evaluation from a local audiologist first, which
can cost between $50 and $200.

Worn Out, Some Step Back From Fight Against AIDS

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

SECTION: Section B; Page 1; Column 2; Metropolitan Desk

LENGTH: 1601 words


Marie St. Cyr first encountered AIDS nine years ago when she headed a
social-services program in Florida. A client in his 30's began losing weight and
falling ill for no apparent reason; he soon died.

Two weeks ago, worn down by the seemingly endless effort against the disease,
Ms. St. Cyr thought of that man as she sat through a memorial service at St.
Peter's Lutheran Church in New York City for Richard Dunne, the former executive
director of the Gay Men's Health Crisis, who died of AIDS-related causes at 46.

"It was such a stark reminder that we haven't moved very far in this crisis,"
said Ms. St. Cyr, who recently resigned as executive director of the Women and
AIDS Resource Network in New York. "People are still dying. The resources are
meager. There's still no cure. You come to a point where you realize, 'How
effective can I be?' "

Emotional Toll

Ten years into an epidemic that has claimed more than 100,000 lives in the
United States, many of those who have long cared for or been advocates for
people with AIDS find themselves overwhelmed by despair or struggling to cope.
Some, like Ms. St. Cyr, who now works with the city's Human Rights Commission,
have recognized signs of burnout and left the field, at least temporarily. Many
others stay on, their commitment fueled by anger or hope, or the fear that if
they quit nobody else will step in to take their place.

As the search for more funds to combat AIDS becomes harder amid budget crises
and recession, and as the growing AIDS caseload both pressures and decimates
their ranks, workers say the AIDS fight is extracting a higher emotional toll.
More and more veterans of the field -- from volunteer "buddies" who do chores
for the very sick to doctors on the cutting edge of research -- are pausing to
assess the implications of that toll and to try to blunt its impact.

"Turnover costs us money and experience," said Paul Kawata, director of the
National Minority AIDS Council in Washington, which provides technical
assistance to 200 organizations. "We're all spending more time looking at how we
can take care of our staff."

Within the last year, AIDS agencies like the Gay Men's Health Crisis in New York
City, which serves 4,500 clients a year, have increased efforts to address the
stress and frustration of their workers. The director ofvolunteers for the Gay
Men's Health Crisis, Joseph Ripple, said three-day "grief and healing"
workshops, begun 10 months ago, have reduced turnover among the organization's
cadre of 2,200 volunteers to a quarter of the previous rate.

Staff support groups, many with psychotherapists, are springing up among more
nonprofit AIDS organizations and medical AIDS units. Some agencies are
consideringflexible schedules, coffee breaks and other concepts borrowed from
the private sector to relieve stress.

Some organizations are also making staff members take vacations, which many
workers had not done because they felt guilty taking time off.

"It's not something that's been addressed because it sounds so self-serving,"
said Regina Quattrochi, who this month became executive director of the AIDS
Resource Center, which provides housing and support services for homeless people
with AIDS. "It's almost like it's taboo to say, 'I also have to take care of
myself.' " She has vowed to give priority to the needs of her staff of 85.

Social Problems

AIDS workers say that watching people in their 20's, 30's and 40's die -- most
after wasting away physically and mentally -- is among the most difficult
aspects of their job.

Many victims are friends and co-workers, and it is not unusual for workers to
have to cope with seeing an entire family, including children, die from the
disease.

As the epidemic has spread among intravenous drug users and their sex partners,
mainly in poor black and Hispanic neighborhoods, those who work with AIDS
victims must deal with the accompanying social ills, like homelessness and
inadequate health care. They must also contend with policy debates like the
dispute over whether to provide condoms to high school students to fight the
spread of the disease.

"It's so frustrating to see political funding and religious barriers preventing
us from stopping this epidemic in its tracks," said Mark Barnes, a lawyer who is
resigning as director of policy for the New York State Department of Health's
AIDS Institute.

Mr. Barnes, 30 years old, is switching to private practice after six years of
AIDS-related work, including cases of housing and job discrimination against
AIDS patients. Most recently he helped devise the state's guidelines for medical
personnel infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.

'You Never Win'

Mr. Barnes said that although he thinks of his work as "a noble calling," the
vastness of the crisis has gradually overwhelmed him, to the point that he feels
inadequate and defeated. More than once in the last few months he has found
himself crying while driving to work.

"In AIDS you never win -- all you do is stave off disaster," he said. "Even when
you get what you want, all you're really doing is controlling the damage. We're
always playing catch-up."

At the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx, where pioneering
research in pediatric AIDS includes an effort to develop a vaccine to block
transmission of the AIDS virus from mother to fetus, AIDS work is a challenge.
But the college's division of allergy and immunology, which is responsible for
staffing AIDS clinics at Montefiore Medical Center and Bronx Municipal Hospital,
must also contend with financial problems and neighborhood opposition to
expanded AIDS services.

The division is frantically trying to make up for the loss of almost $1 million
in state and private grants, in order to keep open the clinics, which served
1,200 patients last year.

"You can't do research without giving service to patients," said the division
director, Dr. Arye Rubinstein.

Difficult to Recruit

Those who treat AIDS patients say that despite strides made in treatment, their
work still boils down to -- as one doctor put it -- "managing death."

"The patient that I treat in 1991 has a better life and lives longer than the
kids I treated in 1981," said Dr. Marc Sicklick, an immunologist and AIDS
researcher who treats children at Albert Einstein's AIDS clinic. "But we always
have to make a decision about when it is not worth it to prolong misery."

Health workers in AIDS medical units say recruiting new staff is difficult,
partly because AIDS workers are often ostracized by colleagues.

"There's absolutely no prestige associated with this job," said Cecilia Douglas,
a nurse clinician on the Albert Einstein team. "People ask you what you do and
you tell them and they think you're so weird."

Dedicated Workers

But for all the emotional hardship that comes with the job, those who take up
the fight against AIDS are moved by a commitment that gives them endurance.
Suzanne C. Ouellette Kobasa, a professor of psychology at the City University of
New York who studied 600 new volunteers at the Gay Men's Health Crisis from 1988
to 1990, found that they viewed AIDS work as highly rewarding. She also found
that although the first volunteers had usually experienced AIDS through the
death of a friend or lover, many new recruits, often women, had no such
connection and simply want to help.

"The changing nature of the volunteer group is important and offers good news,"
she said. "Many of them are coming without a lot of AIDS stresses already in
their lives."

Hal J. Moskowitz, a 37-year-old medical equipment specialist, joined G.M.H.C.'s
volunteer corps in 1983. Since then he has done it all, from changing soiled
bedsheets to talking on the telephone with AIDS patients for hours at a time. He
is still going strong.

"This disease is preventable," he said. "If I educate somebody and prevent them
from getting infected, I've done something."

Magda Martas, 27, who joined Albert Einstein's AIDS unit last July as an
outreach worker, conceded that she was depressed over the recent death of a
client, a 25-year-old woman with three children. "Every time this happens I will
cry and be devastated," she said. "But there's always another person to help."

More than 161,000 Americans have been diagnosed with AIDS, and Federal health
officials estimate that a million Americans are infected with the AIDS virus.
Those afflicted with the disease still make up a major portion of the anti-AIDS
work force.

"Some people need tranquillity when they're ill," said Larry Gutenberg, who
serves on the board of the People With AIDS Coalition and who was diagnosed with
AIDS in 1989. "I find that controlled anger is the elixir that prolongs one's
life."

And many of those who have decided to quit AIDS work as a vocation, like Mr.
Barnes and Ms. St. Cyr, still do volunteer work.

"I've learned a lot from the courage of those who have died," Ms. St. Cyr, 40,
said. "It's not an ending struggle for me."

One night last month, 35 men and women -- the newest batch of volunteers --
gathered in a room at the Gay Men's Health Crisis headquarters in Chelsea for an
orientation session. The group, which included waiters, computer specialists and
grieving friends of some who had died, listened thoughtfully as Mr. Moskowitz
shared his experiences with AIDS and encouraged them to lend a hand.

"This is something you shouldn't fear, but something you should get into with a
lot of determination and hope," he said. "I can guarantee you, at the end of it,
you won't recognize yourself."

THE DOCTOR'S WORLD;
AIDS DATA POUR IN, AS STUDIES PROLIFERATE

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN, M.D.

SECTION: Section C; Page 3, Column 1; Science Desk

LENGTH: 1310 words


ATLANTA

THE figures on acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or AIDS, are stark:

- There have been 9,760 cases in the United States, including at least 4,760
deaths, reported to the Centers for Disease Control here as of April 22.


- The estimated costs of treatment, disability and lost work from the first
9,000 cases is $5.6 billion.


- As many as one million Americans may have been exposed to the AIDS virus. No
one knows how many among that group will develop the disease, or what the total
number of AIDS cases or their costs will be in another year or by 1990.


- Some 250 of the 36,315 hospital beds in New York City are occupied by AIDS
patients at any one time. The San Francisco General Hospital has an entire ward
devoted to AIDS cases and officials of other hospitals are considering taking a
similar step to cope with the growing problem.


- The incidence of AIDS in Geneva and Paris now rivals that in Los Angeles,
reflecting the surge of cases outside the United States. More AIDS cases are
being diagnosed in countries throughout the world but data are imprecise.

The first steps have been taken in seeking an effective treatment for the deadly
disease.

Last week, more than 2,100 researchers from 30 countries gathered here for an
international conference on AIDS sponsored by the Federal Government, the World
Health Organization and Emory University. It was the largest conference ever
held on AIDS and there were standing- room-only crowds until the 392d, and last,
presentation was made Wednesday.


The soaring incidence, soaring costs and exploding bits of scientific
information are clearly beginning to capture much more attention in the world
medical community.

The nearly 10,000 cases of AIDS reported since the disease was discovered in
1981 in New York and California pale against the numbers of those who have
developed heart disease or cancer in the same period. But AIDS has more
importance than than the mere numbers indicate, because of the disease's
relentless increase. It is now appearing in cities and towns where people
believed it would not occur.

Death from the chronic wasting of AIDS is terrifying, often requires long
hospital stays and is very expensive. And because scientists have so much to
learn about the disease, people fear the unknown. Many AIDS victims have been
shunned as lepers for fear that AIDS can be spread by casual contact. Another
fear is that AIDS will soon race through heterosexuals the way it has through
homosexuals, becoming the new syphilis in the New World.

The amount of data accumulated in less than four years and reported here
staggered even members of the small core of physicians who discovered this
dreadful disease. Like most large scientific meetings, a melange of information
was exchanged. Much was a consolidation of information obtained from results of
scores of studies using the first laboratory test to detect evidence of the AIDS
virus, variously known as LAV or HTLV-3.

Some information was profound, some trivial. Much of it reflected the tedious,
necessary and unexciting dotting of i's and crossing of t's by which scientists
verify the validity of their results and improve on their methodologies.

Although no major advances were reported to benefit those now dying from AIDS,
some data offered a glimmer of hope for an eventual cure and prevention of this
now untreatable disease.


In the last year at least six drugs have been found that have some anti- AIDS
virus action, and doctors have begun or plan to start testing them in a very
small number of patients. If any show early promise, randomly controlled studies
will be needed among patients in the early stages of infection to assure that
the drugs are effective. Because such testing is complicated it will be years
before the Food and Drug Administration licenses those that work, and people
with AIDS will probably have to take them for a lifetime to keep the virus under
control.

Among the candidate drugs under study in the United States, France and Sweden
are: Ansamycin; HPA-23 (antimoniotungstate); Interferon; Ribavirin; Suramin; and
phosphonoformate. In addition, doctors are studying the possibility of using
natural substances called antibodies in the treatment of AIDS, and are
identifying subunits of the AIDS virus that might be used to develop an
effective vaccine to prevent infection.

''We have a long way to go before AIDS is preventable or treatable, but the
first steps have been taken, and we are on our way,'' said Dr. Martin S. Hirsch
of the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.


AIDS can cause a persistent infection of the central nervous system and damage
the brain to cause a type of dementia resembling Alzheimer's disease. Dr. Jimmie
C. B. Holland of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York urged
doctors not to assume that behavioral changes in AIDS patients are simply the
result of depression. She pointed out that among the early indications of brain
damage are persistent headaches, inability to concentrate, a generalized slowing
down, lack of interest and withdrawal. Deterioration of an individual's mental
state can be rapid.

Increasing evidence of such damage to the white matter of brain has strengthened
the resemblance of the AIDS virus to the visna virus that belongs to the
lentivirus group that can destroy the nervous systems of sheep.


AIDS was first identified among homosexuals, and opinion is divided over the
extent of its spread now among heterosexuals. Because the incubation period of
the disease is so long, many heterosexuals might be infected now but will not
develop symptoms for years, though they may be infecting others now.

Some experts are skeptical that AIDS will spread as rapidly among heterosexuals
as it has among homosexuals. Yet other experts, taking their cues from data
emerging from preliminary studies from Africa showing equal sex distribution
among males and females, are less sure.

One expert believes public health workers are at a turning point in their
strategy to prevent the further spread of AIDS, particularly among
heterosexuals. Dr. Dean F. Echenberg, an official of the San Francisco Health
Department, said his organization would soon apply to AIDS the standard public
health measures used to check the spread of sexually transmitted, or venereal,
diseases.

Mass education measures were used to encourage life style changes among
homosexuals after AIDS was first recognized in that group. Because about one in
two homosexual men in San Francisco have been exposed to the AIDS virus, tracing
individual cases is not practical. Now advances in the scientific understanding
of the nature of AIDS make necessary a more individualized approach to check the
spread among heterosexuals, less than 1 percent of whom have been exposed to the
virus, Dr. Echenberg said.

Under the San Francisco plan, a multidisciplinary team of epidemiologists,
psychologists, sociologists and others will track down sexual contacts, give
them AIDS tests, and offer counseling to those who are found to have been
exposed to the AIDS virus and who thus are considered capable of passing the
virus on to sexual contacts. The strategy, Dr. Echenberg said, ''rests on the
assumption that no individual would want to unknowingly infect others.''

As the AIDS virus test is used more often, more positive results will be found
among ''many people who did not have a clue they might'' have been exposed, Dr.
Echenberg said.

Women who are found to be AIDS- test-positive will be counseled on the risks of
pregnancy because some children born to mothers with AIDS or carrying the virus
have developed AIDS.

Dr. Echenberg estimated that of the 500 AIDS patients living in San Francisco,
about 60 are bisexuals or have had contacts with heterosexual intravenous drug
addicts.

THE DOCTOR'S WORLD;
IN PURSUIT OF THE CAUSE OF AIDS

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN, M.D.

SECTION: Section C; Page 5, Column 3; Science Desk

LENGTH: 1073 words


WHAT if the cause of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) were discovered
tomorrow and a reliable diagnostic test developed?

Obviously, such an advance would go far toward relieving the anxieties of many
people about their risks of getting the disease. But such advances would not
necessarily save the lives of any people who now have AIDS or who are incubating
it. Nor would the advances necessarily mean that doctors could immediately
develop ways to prevent AIDS.

Any time the cause of a disease is discovered and a new diagnostic test is
developed, many questions arise. In the case of AIDS, the availability of a
specific diagnostic test would help answer some fundamental questions about the
natural history of the disease, including these:


- If AIDS is caused by a microbe, how many of the people who are infected with
the agent are capable of passing it on to others? For how long, and at what
stages of the disease?


- How many of those who are exposed to the AIDS agent catch the disease?


- Is there an association between the presence of symptoms and the ability to
transmit the disease?

- Are there carriers of AIDS, people who harbor the disease agent and pass it to
others, without feeling ill themselves? Both hepatitis B and typhoid fever can
be spread by such carriers.


- How many people with symptoms can transmit the disease, and how many without
symptoms can transmit it?


To answer these and many other questions, scientists must study two groups of
people: those who face the greatest risk of contracting AIDS, and control
populations, people who resemble the high-risk group as much as possible except
for the risk factors themselves. Indeed, the National Institutes of Health in
Bethesda, Md., has awarded grants for such studies.

Meanwhile, studies that were begun for other purposes are now being used to
investigate the AIDS epidemic. For example, the San Francisco Health Department
and the national Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta are following a group of
homosexual men who volunteered for a study of hepatitis B from 1978 to 1980. To
date, it appears that about 1 percent of these men have developed AIDS. The
incidence of AIDS among people in the sample who are between the ages of 30 and
35 seems to be about 2 percent, which many epidemiologists consider a staggering
figure.

Clues may also be found by following up on accidents involving medical personnel
who work with AIDS patients or laboratory samples. For example, a few workers
have accidentally stuck themselves with needles used for injections in treating
an AIDS patient. None of those workers have developed AIDS so far. But
researchers are following them very carefully; if any develop the disease, much
could be learned from the tragedy about the spread of AIDS and even its cause.


New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Miami and Newark are the cities that have
reported the greatest number of AIDS cases in this country. There have been
times when, in some hospitals in these cities, the majority of patients in
intensive care units have been AIDS victims.

Given that situation, researchers had to develop new studies for AIDS much
faster than usual. Dr. James W. Curran, who heads the AIDS task force at the
Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, said in an interview he suspected that
''AIDS has produced more of a flurry of rapidly designed research than almost
any other medical public health problem.''

Though such studies are based on the present state of knowledge, they must be
able to incorporate new knowledge as it comes along. For example, there is no
AIDS diagnostic test. But the new studies must be flexible enough to accommodate
such a diagnostic test if it comes along.


Although Dr. Curran said he did not expect a quick solution to the AIDS
epidemic, he did foresee ''a lot of progress'' soon. According to Dr. Curran,
most experts now believe AIDS is caused by a transmissible agent, presumably a
virus, although he recognizes that there are some who believe in a noninfectious
cause of AIDS.

Some researchers believe that a virus called HTLV (for human T-cell leukemia
virus) or a close relative may be the cause of AIDS. It is a member of a group
of viruses called retroviruses. Evidence from studies in this country and in
France has given tantalizing suggestions that a retrovirus may cause AIDS. But
other scientists, arguing from other data, have expressed doubt that
retroviruses are at fault. In fact, some suspect that retroviruses may be just
another of the many opportunistic microorganisms that characterize the disease
by infecting AIDS patients.

Dr. Curran said he himself believed a retrovirus was the best bet for the cause
of AIDS. As head of the AIDS task force, he said that researchers had to follow
a law in medicine known as the Willie Sutton law, after the famous bank robber.
Asked once why he robbed banks, Willie Sutton replied: ''Because that's where
the money is.''

''Where should we put our money?'' Dr. Curran asked, adding: ''Where would
Willie Sutton go? He would go with retroviruses, I think, right now.''

Still, Dr. Curran acknowledged that many reservations are in order about the
retrovirus hypothesis. Those who were raising their eyebrows, he said, were
expressing ''the appropriate scientific skepticism.''


Many people believe that when researchers discover the cause of an infectious
disease, they can then develop a vaccine to prevent it. Unfortunately, the
reality is that not all discoveries of disease organisms lead to vaccines.

Even when vaccines can be developed, they do not come speedily. And after the
vaccine is available, it may take centuries to eradicate the disease. Consider
smallpox: The vaccine was developed in 1796, but not until 1980 was smallpox
eradicated.

There are immunizations against other major diseases, including diphtheria,
pneumococcal pneumonia, poliomyelitis, measles, mumps, rubella tetanus and
yellow fever. But some immunizations are far from perfect, as is evident from
the continuing influenza epidemics that devastate populations throughout the
world and the attempts to develop a safer immunization against whooping cough.
There are also experimental vaccines against less common diseases. Meanwhile,
researchers are working to develop immunizations against a host of other
infectious diseases - gonorrhea and leprosy, for examples - whose causes have
been known for many decades.

COMMENT: WHO WILL HEAR? AN EXAMINATION OF THE REGULATION OF HEARING AIDS

NAME: Steven B. Adams

 LEXISNEXIS SUMMARY:
 ... An estimated 23.5 million Americans suffer from a hearing loss. ...  After
reviewing the comments from both sides, the FDA concluded that the regulation of
licensing hearing aid dispensers should be left almost entirely to the states.
...  The second major problem impeding the adequate use of hearing aids is
evidenced by the regulations themselves, specifically, the FDA regulation
allowing a hearing aid purchaser to waive a medical examination, which is
essential to determining whether the purchaser is a proper candidate for a
hearing aid. ... Dispensers are generally trained in sales tactics that may
cause a consumer to purchase a costly hearing aid that may not be appropriate to
compensate for his or her hearing loss. ...  Although some states require a
licensed hearing aid dispenser to supervise the sale of hearing aids by trainees
or salespeople, "the supervision requirement has been abused by dealers and in
most instances the supervision is so attenuated that it is nonexistent." In
order to avoid this abuse, state licensing and regulatory boards should prohibit
the sale of hearing aids by anyone except a licensed hearing aid dispenser. ...
Today, more than 85% of adults who purchase a hearing aid make use of the
waiver. ...

TEXT:
 [*505]

    The study of hearing and hearing impairments can be traced back to the Greek
scientist Pythagoras and his study relating pitch to the length of strings on
musical instruments.  n1 Hearing impairment occurs in numerous ways.  n2 The
more common causes include diseases, such as rubella of the mother during
pregnancy, trauma to the head, stroke, infections of the inner ear, and
excessive noise.  n3 The development of devices to aid those with hearing
impairments has advanced rapidly since the early Twentieth Century.  n4 Properly
matched to the individual, modern hearing aids can provide a great deal of
assistance to the hearing impaired.  n5

    Hearing aids are the third most widely used medical assistive device in the
United States, following eyeglasses and canes.  n6 An estimated 23.5 million
Americans suffer from a hearing loss.  n7 A hearing loss is measured in decibels
and may be mild, moderate, severe, or profound.  n8 The majority of individuals
suffering from hearing loss do not experience the loss suddenly: rather, the
loss is brought about by "an accumulation of many years of trauma to the ear."
n9 A hearing loss can operate not only on the volume of sound perceived, but
also on the clarity or ability to distinguish sounds.  n10 Often the result is
the inability to distinguish a voice from the background noises surrounding it.
n11  [*506]

    Part I of this Comment explores the reasons in favor of hearing aid
regulation on both personal and economic levels. Part II of this Comment
examines regulations governing the hearing aid, as set forth in the Medical
Devices Amendments, and discusses who these regulations affect. Part III of this
Comment focuses on important problems that have arisen under current
regulations, which have been brought to the forefront by recent actions of the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and by hearings held before the United States
Senate Special Committee on Aging. Finally, Part IV discusses the need for new
regulations and considers whether enforcement of current regulations can solve
the difficulties now facing the industry and the affected public. This Comment
concludes that modification of current regulations, in combination with a
renewed effort at enforcement, would greatly enhance the ability of
hearing-impaired consumers to receive correct hearing aids, and at the same time
enhance the image of the hearing aid industry.


   I. What Beneficial Effect Does The Properly Fitted Hearing Aid Have on the
Individual?

   A. Effects on Quality of Life

 A hearing loss can limit an individual in all aspects of daily living. The loss
can affect one's ability to communicate in both a professional and social
capacity, and can be devastating to a person's ability to function in a society
dominated by the hearing.  n12 Often, hearing-impaired individuals will
gradually withdraw from family members and associates as their ability to
understand others diminishes.  n13 Of the estimated 23.5 million Americans with
hearing loss, only about 3.78 to 5 million own hearing aids.  n14 A market
survey conducted by the Hearing Industries Association found that a variety of
consumer perceptions of hearing aids and hearing loss may contribute to this low
figure.  n15  [*507]

    Several recent studies clearly indicate that a hearing aid confers many more
benefits than just the ability to hear better.  n16 A study on the quality of
life for the elderly, conducted at Rush Medical College in Chicago, found that
the quality of life for many elderly persons is diminished not by the presence
of illness, but by the effect that illness has on their daily lives.  n17 "Even
if participants had a dozen diseases ... as long as they could still be active
and involved with other people" they were happy with their lives in their later
years.  n18 The researchers found that improved hearing, in turn, improved the
individual's daily activities and thus their quality of life.  n19

    Another study, reported in the Annals of Internal Medicine,  n20 found that
"hearing loss is associated with important adverse effects on the quality of
life of elderly persons, effects that are reversible with hearing aids."  n21 In
this study, one group of elderly veterans was provided with hearing aids;
another group was placed on a waiting list for hearing aids.  n22 The group
given the aids "had significantly improved scores for social and emotional
function, communication function, cognitive function, and depression."  n23

    A recent market study examined the effects of presbycusis, a common disorder
among the elderly that results in a hearing loss.  n24 This study found the
adverse effects of hearing impairment to include a decline in general health in
addition to emotional, behavioral, and social problems.  n25 Adults with hearing
impairments were found to spend more days in bed and to visit a doctor more
often than those without hearing  [*508]  impairments.  n26 The study concluded
that treating hearing-impaired adults with hearing aids leads to improved
psychological functioning.  n27

    These studies clearly illustrate that a hearing aid greatly enhances the
quality of life for the hearing impaired, especially for the elderly. Not only
does a proper hearing aid improve the user's quality of life, it actually plays
a role in reducing overall health costs by reducing the number of doctor visits
and improving general health. The benefits of hearing aids are an important
consideration in the ongoing debate over the health care system in the United
States. For these reasons, it is necessary that persons seeking to purchase a
hearing aid be assured that they are getting the best possible aid for their
specific hearing impairment.


   B. The Needs of the Elderly Consumer

 In any discussion of hearing aids, it is important to note that sixty percent
of potential hearing aid users are over the age of sixty-five.  n28 Furthermore,
the over sixty-five population in the United States is rapidly increasing.  n29
These factors make health policy regarding hearing aids especially timely. The
over sixty-five population is a specialized market and, as such, has unique
characteristics that must be considered when discussing hearing aids and policy
issues relating to their use.  n30

    The elderly hearing aid purchaser is often more trusting than the average
consumer.  n31 Older consumers are "more oriented to internal knowledge and
experience" than to "external knowledge and experience."  n32 Often this
internal knowledge is outdated in our rapidly changing society or is incomplete
when compared to the knowledge of the younger consumer.  n33 Moreover, the
elderly consumer is more susceptible to high  [*509]  pressure sales tactics,
n34 especially when the sale takes place in the consumer's home, a common
practice employed by door-to-door hearing aid dispensers.  n35 Furthermore, the
hearing aid is often a major purchase for many elderly consumers.  n36 The
average cost of one hearing aid is over $ 600, and often a person will need two.
n37 Because most hearing aids are not covered by Medicare or most insurance
policies, hearing aid purchasers have to rely on their own savings and
resources.  n38 The financial burden assumed by the hearing impaired purchaser
may significantly deplete an an older individual's savings.

   II. Regulations Governing Hearing Aid Sales

 The manufacture, sale, and distribution of hearing aids is governed by three
overlapping bodies of law.  n39 These three bodies of law, which also oversee
the advertising claims made by hearing aid manufacturers and dispensers, include
federal laws, state laws, and state licensing board requirements.  n40 The
federal laws are policed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the
Federal Trade Commission (FTC), state laws are enforced by states' attorneys
general, and licensing boards enforce their own licensing criteria.  n41

   A. Current Federal Regulations Governing the Sale of Hearing Aids

   1. Promulgation of the 1977 Regulations

 Federal regulations governing the sale, distribution and advertisement of
hearing aids are set forth in Volume 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations  n42
and in the Federal Trade Commission Act.  n43 The most controversial section of
the current federal regulations is section801.421(a),  n44 which provides for
the conditions of the sale of hearing aids. This section states that any seller
of hearing aids is directed by law not to sell a hearing aid unless "the
prospective user has presented to the hearing aid dis [*510]  penser a written
statement signed by a licensed physician that states that the patient's hearing
loss has been medically evaluated and the patient may be considered a candidate
for a hearing aid."  n45 In addition, the required evaluation must have taken
place within the six months preceding the written statement.  n46 The
regulations also state that the purchaser may waive this medical evaluation so
long as the dispenser informs the purchaser that waiving the examination is "not
in the user's best health interest."  n47 In addition, the dispenser cannot
encourage the purchaser to waive the examination.  n48 The purchaser must also
be given the opportunity to sign a statement informing him that the waiver is
not in his best medical interest and that he wishes nevertheless to waive the
examination.  n49

    Section 801.421(a) became effective on August 15, 1977, after several Senate
subcommittees investigating the matter heard testimony on the issues and the FDA
received comments on the proposed rules.  n50 These comments ranged from calls
for stricter rules to demands for more lenient requirements.  n51 Among the
proposals advocating stricter control of the hearing aid marketplace was the
request that a physical examination be required of potential hearing aid
recipients.  n52

    After hearings before the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations
were conducted, Subcommittee Chair Senator Charles H. Percy observed that,
"twenty million hearing-impaired Americans are being denied top-flight treatment
by a delivery system that simply is not working."  n53 Senator Percy recommended
a rule that would "restrict the sale of hearing aids to those patients who had
undergone a medical evaluation."  n54 Those who opposed the required examination
argued that it was an infringement of individual rights, it would impose
hardship on potential hearing aid users not in the vicinity of a health care
provider, and that  [*511]  it violated certain philosophical and political
beliefs.  n55 In its final decision, the FDA decided to require a physical
examination with the caveat that it could be waived only by a "fully informed
adult."  n56 The FDA Commission stated that because "the exercise of such a
waiver of medical evaluation is not in the best health interest of the patient,
the opportunity for waiver is limited to fully informed adult patients."  n57
The FDA anticipated that the waiver would constitute the exception rather than
the rule, thereby allowing individuals objecting to the physical examination the
opportunity to receive hearing aids without an examination.  n58

    In addition to calls for requiring a physical examination of potential
hearing aid users were requests for more federal involvement in the licensing of
hearing aid dispensers.  n59 Proponents argued that where state licensing laws
were weak, federal licensing statutes would "protect the public against unfit
and inept practitioners."  n60 After reviewing the comments from both sides, the
FDA concluded that the regulation of licensing hearing aid dispensers should be
left almost entirely to the states.  n61 The Commissioner stated: "Strong State
and local licensing laws are needed to establish and maintain minimum competency
requirements for those persons who test for hearing loss and select and fit
hearing aids."  n62 The federal rules omitting licensing regulation went into
effect in 1977, and, to date, "strong" state licensing laws have failed to
materialize.

   2. Misleading Advertising Violations Within the Jurisdiction of the Federal
Trade Commission

 The federal laws governing misleading advertisements and claims made concerning
hearing aids are enforced by the FTC under 45(a) of the Federal Trade Commission
Act (FTCA).  n63 The relevant part of the section provides that "unfair or
deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce, are declared unlawful."
n64 If a violator is notified through a cease and desist order that its hearing
aid advertisements are false or mis [*512]  leading, the FTC may seek civil
penalties.  n65 Despite the FTC's broad power, it has taken little action
against hearing aid dispensers. In fact, the FTC has enforced its authority over
deceptive advertisers of hearing aids in only two cases between 1985 and 1993.
n66 Such agency inaction does not further the cause of accurate advertising in
the sale of hearing aids.

   B. State Regulation of Hearing Aid Dispensers

 Licensing boards differ from state to state. In some states they are comprised
of both professionals and consumers; in other states, the boards are composed
solely of professionals.  n67 Although the composition of licensing boards may
differ, they all serve the same basic purpose:  n68 to "set standards for
minimum competency, licensure, and practice; investigate complaints; and
discipline practitioners."  n69 A consumer survey of those licensing boards
found that licensing boards possessed "adequate oversight, disciplinary, and
enforcement powers, but seldom used them."  n70 Because these boards lack the
funding to aggressively enforce their regulations, they are often referred to as
"reactive boards," meaning that they only act in response to consumer
complaints.  n71 The failure of these boards to be pro-active further
illustrates the weakness of the other mechanisms.

   C. What Defines the Hearing Aid Dispensers?

 Licensing boards, along with federal and state laws, govern three basic groups
of hearing aid dispensers,  n72 which include physicians, audiologists, and
hearing instrument specialists.  n73 Each group is distinct, in that differing
requirements must be fulfilled before a licensee is permitted to prac [*513]
tice as a hearing instrument specialist, an audiologist, or a physician.  n74

    Physicians who diagnose and treat ear dysfunction and hearing loss are
divided into three groups: otologists, otorhinolaryngologists, and
aotolaryngologists.  n75 These physicians must complete four years of medical
school, and fulfill the general requirements for professional licensure in their
particular states.

    Dispensing audiologists conduct tests to determine the proper hearing aid
and fit, and also provide aural rehabilitation.  n76 Audiologists are usually
certified by the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) and possess
a Certificate on Clinical Competence (CCC-A).  n77 Forty-three states provide
licensing boards for audiologists; most requiring CCC-A certification.  n78 In
order to be certified, an audiologist must possess a master's degree in
audiology, complete a nine-month, post-graduate clinical internship, and pass a
national examination.  n79 Approximately two-fifths of U.S. audiologists work in
private practice, with the remaining three-fifths practicing in clinics.  n80

    Hearing instrument specialists, also known as hearing aid dealers, may also
dispense hearing aids.  n81 Forty-eight states have established licensing boards
for hearing instrument specialists.  n82 Although requirements for qualification
as a hearing aid dealer vary greatly from state to state, several common
requirements must be met. A hearing aid dealer must be a high-school graduate or
possess a general equivalency degree (GED), must be at least eighteen years old,
and must "be in good health and of good moral character."  n83 Some states
require a limited training program, and there may be a licensure examination
with a degree of difficulty that varies from state to state.  n84 A hearing aid
dealer's primary place of business is a retail establishment specializing in
testing hearing and selling  [*514]  hearing aids.  n85 The dealer performs no
aural rehabilitation. The variety of state licensing schemes makes it difficult
to extrapolate any common licensing scheme.

   III. Problems Under Current Federal Regulations

   A. Misleading Advertising As a Major Impediment to Effective Use of Hearing
Aids

 Several serious problems must be corrected before the hearing aid can
adequately benefit the millions of hearing-impaired persons now suffering from a
hearing loss. These problems are not new to the hearing aid industry and were
actually examined when the current federal regulations went into effect in 1977.
n86 The most serious and widely recognized of these problems is false and
misleading advertisements made to the public regarding the benefits received
from the use of a hearing aid.  n87 Another serious problem is the potential and
apparent abuse of the current regulations under which a consumer may waive the
physical examination required to purchase a hearing aid.  n88 Moreover, some
hearing aid dispensers apparently lack the training necessary to properly
examine potential hearing aid users.  n89 Often these dispensers do not conduct
adequate tests, or understand the results of the tests they do conduct.  n90
Finally, there is an increasing call for "laws ... at the state or federal level
which ban or restrict home solicitation sales of hearing aids."  n91 Home sales
present an inherently difficult problem to both the seller and the  [*515]
purchaser.  n92

    Misrepresentation of the capabilities of hearing aids only tarnishes the
reputation of the entire hearing aid industry. Such misrepresentation also
improperly leads those who might benefit from the use of a hearing aid to
develop unrealistic expectations about the capabilities of current technology.
n93 Misleading advertisements in the hearing aid industry were first recognized
and prohibited in 1934.  n94 In April of 1993, the FDA sent letters to six
hearing aid manufacturers warning them to cease making false claims regarding
the capabilities of hearing aids to consumers.  n95 These manufacturers were
charged with making claims that hearing aids could eliminate background noise.
n96 In addition, the FDA alleged that manufacturers made claims that were
unsubstantiated by clinical data, failed to disclose material information, and
overstated the quality and value of the hearing aids.  n97

    Two of these six manufacturers, Beltone Electronics Corp. and Dahlberg
Electronics, Inc., had consent orders issued against them by the FTC in 1976
directing them to cease making unreasonable claims as to their products'
abilities.  n98 These two manufacturers were also issued consent orders for
their misleading advertising practices prior to the 1976 orders.  n99 These
manufacturers appear to be representative of a pattern  [*516]  of abuse of
unenforced hearing aid regulation: misleading advertisements that overstate a
hearing aid's capabilities.

    A recent editorial by David Kirkwood, editor-in-chief of The Hearing
Journal, aptly represents the attitude of the hearing aid industry toward false
advertising. Mr. Kirkwood states that it is too much to expect hearing aid
advertisers to "present a full and objective picture of the product being
promoted."  n100 Mr. Kirkwood states that the hearing aid industry uses "hype"
in its advertisements no more than any other industry in promoting its products
in order to attract customers.  n101 Despite the fact that companies do use hype
in the promotion of their products, this still is not a license to mislead
consumers.

   B. The Option of Waiving a Medical Examination Has Led to Consumer
Misinformation

 The second major problem impeding the adequate use of hearing aids is evidenced
by the regulations themselves, specifically, the FDA regulation allowing a
hearing aid purchaser to waive a medical examination, which is essential to
determining whether the purchaser is a proper candidate for a hearing aid.  n102
Unfortunately, the option of waiver has produced a breeding ground for fraud and
misinformation.  n103 This problem was clearly expressed by Donald Darling,
director of West Virginia's Antitrust/Consumer Protection Division:



   The most pervasive problem I have encountered in my investigation of hearing
aid dispensers is the falsification of waiver of medical evaluation forms and
the omission to inform prospective users that it is in their best health
interest to have a medical evaluation by a licensed physician prior to
purchasing a hearing  [*517]  aid.  n104



   If the examination is waived, and the dispenser either fails to perform the
necessary tests or fails to understand the results of a test, a dispenser may
sell an inneffective aid to a purchaser, or may misdiagnose the purchaser's need
for a hearing aid.  n105 In addition to potentially burdening the consumer with
a heavy financial obligation, the dispenser may prevent the purchaser from
discovering a surgically correctable hearing impairment. Waiver of the medical
examination undoubtedly has produced repercussions for the individual who
suffers a hearing loss. "Serious medical conditions are overlooked by
non-physician providers [dispensers] subsequently necessitating more extensive
medical and or surgical treatment than would have been necessary originally,
adding additional cost and suffering to the patient and cost to the health care
system."  n106

   C. The Need for Stricter Training and Licensing of Dealers

 A troubling aspect of the current hearing aid industry is that aid dispensers
are unable to diagnose adequately a hearing loss, and they are unable to
prescribe the correct type of hearing aid in conjunction with rehabilitative
training necessary to adjust to the aid and to communicate more clearly.  n107
Hearing aid dispensers are often given inadequate training on the physiology and
anatomy of the inner ear.  n108 Dispensers are generally trained in sales
tactics that may cause a consumer to purchase a costly hearing aid that may not
be appropriate to compensate for his or her hearing loss.  n109

    Although some states require a licensed hearing aid dispenser to supervise
the sale of hearing aids by trainees or salespeople, "the supervision
requirement has been abused by dealers and in most instances the supervision is
so attenuated that it is nonexistent."  n110 In order to avoid this abuse, state
licensing and regulatory boards should prohibit the sale of  [*518]  hearing
aids by anyone except a licensed hearing aid dispenser. Until these conditions
are enforced, the same abuses of the rules will continue to occur as has
occurred under the false advertisement regulations. Suspending the licenses of
abusive dealers would send a clear message that inadequate examination services
provided to the hearing aid consumer will not be tolerated.

   D. Dangers of Door-to-Door Hearing Aid Sales

 Door-to-door sales of hearing aids is another problem with providing adequate
hearing aids to the hearing-impaired consumer.  n111 The high pressure sales
tactics,  n112 may be particularly abusive if used on elderly individuals,
especially when used at an elderly consumer's home, because the individual with
the hearing impairment has no opportunity to walk away from the transaction.

    Other medical assistive devices, such as eyeglasses and dentures, are not
sold in the home; however high pressure hearing aid dispensers are allowed to
influence elderly individuals into making a substantial purchase with little or
no supervision.  n113 Moreover, dispensers may wear white coats leading the
consumer to believe that they are doctors.  n114 The elderly consumer may fail
to differentiate between a trained professional, such as an optometrist or
audiologist, and the dispenser in the white coat.  n115

    Proper testing of an individual is essential to the effective fitting of a
hearing aid. These tests cannot accurately be performed in the home because of
background noise and/or a lack of the necessary equipment carried by the
door-to-door salesperson.  n116 If this testing is not adequately performed, the
hearing aid will likely be of little value to the wearer, just as an incorrect
eyeglass prescription would not benefit someone with impaired vision. Because a
majority of persons with hearing loss have what is known as "progressive or
fluctuating losses," an outdated audiological examination will also be of little
benefit.  n117 It is necessary to perform the  [*519]  essential tests within
six months of the time the aid is obtained. In addition, this essential testing
cannot be performed in the home.

   IV. Solutions to Current Problems With Hearing Aid Industry Regulation

 Although many problems confront both the hearing aid industry and
hearing-impaired consumers, viable solutions do exist. Some of the solutions are
simple and thus more easily implemented; others, however, are more controversial
due to the fact that they will involve additional costs. Regardless of whether
the solution is painless or fraught with controversy, it must be remembered that
the overarching goal of the hearing aid industry should be to provide an
effective medical assistive device to millions of Americans whose lives would be
enhanced by its use.

    Fraudulent misrepresentation of the capabilities of hearing aids must be
stopped. An enforcement mechanism that does no more than cause the violator to
simply cease making claims for a short period of time should not be tolerated.
Federal regulations already exist to stop fraudulent advertising,  n118 but,
unless the laws are enforced, hearing aid manufacturers have little to fear when
making false statements about their products.  n119 Civil penalties available to
enforce the current regulations  n120 should be used to alert the industry that
ads claiming that "nerve deafness can be helped! Nerve deafness, a common cause
of hearing impairment, can be helped, even though there is no surgical or
medical cure available"  n121 will not be tolerated. Although the recent letters
sent by the FDA are a welcome step, they appear to have been a step taken only
at the behest of FDA Commissioner David Kessler; consequently, it is a very real
possibility that they will be ignored once this active Commissioner leaves
office.  n122 Consistent enforcement of the regulations now in place must become
a priority of the agencies involved, in order to stop the recurrence of false
advertising in the hearing aid industry.

    To prevent hearing aid dispensers from abusing the availability of the
medical waiver, the waiver option should be eliminated. The rationale  [*520]
accepted upon passage of the waiver was not to create a loophole for dispensers
wishing to make a quick sale, the waiver option was in fact intended to be the
exception to the rule, not the norm.  n123 The medical examination waiver was
originally intended to allow those with specific religious beliefs against
medical examinations to opt out, yet to still have the option of using a hearing
aid if they wished.  n124 Today, more than 85% of adults who purchase a hearing
aid make use of the waiver.  n125 In order to reverse this trend, the ease with
which the waiver is obtained must be eliminated. The FDA is currently
considering either eliminating the waiver option, or, at a minimum,
substantially limiting the availability of the waiver.  n126

    To avoid the seemingly widespread problem of misdiagnosing a hearing loss,
the solution is straightforward: dispensing hearing aids should be limited to
those who are specially trained to do so, such as audiologists or physicians.
Hearing aid specialists, dealers, and others without adequate training should
not be allowed to dispense aids. This would eliminate the majority of
inappropriate aids provided to persons with hearing loss.  n127 The economic
problem this would present for the hearing aid manufacturer is obvious:
suddenly, a large portion of the manufacturers' sales force would be prohibited
from participating in the market. In contrast, this elimination would benefit
the consumer, who would receive a higher standard of care from dispensing
audiologists and physicians.

    The problem of door-to-door sales of hearing aids has two possible
solutions. Either this type of sale could be prohibited altogether, or hearing
aid dispensers performing this type of sale could be required to provide a bond
with the state in which they practice.  n128 Prohibition of the practice would
be the more effective solution, considering the factors previously discussed
regarding elderly consumers in the home.  n129

   V. Conclusion

 The hearing aid can be a valuable medical assistive device if the appropriate
steps are taken to assure that the person with the hearing loss receives the
appropriate aid. Misleading advertising, the option to waive a  [*521]  medical
examination, the need for stricter training and licensing of dealers, and the
improper door-to-door selling of hearing aids are all major obstacles to the
efficient distribution of hearing aids to hearing-impaired persons. As the
elderly population in the United States grows ever larger, the problems facing
the hearing aid industry grow ever greater and their effect widens. The
solutions to these problems are readily available, and now is the time to act.

sacrifice efficiency and that the choice to give them priority should be the
fruit of an integrative decisionmaking process. ... The author then explains how

TEXT:
 [*284]  The legal basis for the control of state aid under European Community
(EC) law is contained in articles 92 to 94 of the EC Treaty, which set out the
principle of the prohibition of state aid and establish the European Commission
as the key institution of control. The intervention of a multitude of other
actors and conflicting Treaty priorities complicates this structure.

   EC Law of State Aid provides an exhaustive and critical examination of state
aid control practice under European law. The book addresses a genuine need for
information on the part of practitioners and academics. Although the title is
clear, the author's refusal to call the book European Union Law of State Aid is
telling. For Evans, state aid control needs to be reformed in order to reflect
the aspirations of the Union. The reform should not only be based on
cost-benefit analysis but also focused on integration at various levels, such as
policy determination, lawmaking, and implementation.  [*285]

   The work covers areas related to the control of state aid, including the
concept of aid, prohibitions, exemptions, and procedures, and blends a
diachronic and synchronic analysis, resulting in technically complex but
comprehensive picture of the issue as a whole. Through a thorough analysis of
the Commission's decisions and their decisionmaking process. The applicability
and implementation of the Treaty provisions depend on a chosen policy. As long
as the policy prioritizes competition, the decisions of the Commission comport
with articles 92 to 94 of the treaty. If the Commission follows other policies,
namely those that respond to other priorities (for example, environment or
agriculture) set forth in the Treaty, the legitimacy of the decisions become
questionable.

   After an introductory chapter, the author identifies, in his second chapter,
the various forms of aid to which the prohibition of article 92(1) applies. The
general prohibition of state aid prescribed in article 92 is part of chapter 1
of Title V of the Treaty, which establishes rules on competition. Concerning
state aid, the emphasis is placed on anti-competitive effects - a presentation
that implies that state aids are per se anti-competitive. Because competition is
seen as the best way to achieve integration, states are forbidden to endanger
the competitive market structure, which, according to Evans, is required to
achieve the goal of integration. Article 92 is one of the Treaty provisions that
enable the Commission to enforce this objective when state action reconstructs
national barriers. Even if market integration is not per se an indication of
efficiency, competition as a means to guarantee integration serves efficiency
goals. Other means, however, may better serve the objective of integration. The
author contends that these means sacrifice efficiency and that the choice to
give them priority should be the fruit of an integrative decisionmaking process.
The existence of such a process is highlighted in the decisions of the
Commission concerning exceptions to the prohibition of article 92(1).

   Through references to articles on the subject and an examination of the
decisions of the Commission, Evans shows that the Commission has broad
discretionary powers to authorize these exemptions. The presumption of
incompatibility of state aid with the common market creates these powers. The
author retains one major general principle for exemption, which he presents in
the third chapter as "compensatory justification." This principle encapsulates
other principles such as community interest, proportionality, non-durability,
development, and transparency. "Compensatory justification" derives from the
rule that necessitas publica major est quam privata, which is the foundation of
the European Community. Regions, sectoral, and horizontal areas of state aid
receive a modulated treatment of the above principles. This explains the
author's choice to refer to the trinomial in the following chapters. The
modulation means that a number of parameters, aside from competitiveness, form
the decisional field of the Commission's state aid control. These aids, which
affect trading conditions, are acceptable providing that priority is given to
the common [*286]  interest. Regional development aid takes precedence over
competition when it better serves integration purposes. Two requirements follow
from this emphasis on development: Such aid should concentrate on needy regions,
and it must create a real development incentive. Sectoral aid aims at the
development of specific economic activities. The development principle is
modulated between the different sectors. horizontal aid, a more heterogeneous
and welcomed category, leads to modulation of the proportionality principle.

   The author then explains how the contents of the criteria determining the
compatibility of state aid with the Treaty are left to the discretion of the
Commission, which believes that regional, sectoral, and horizontal aid may be
judicious means of contributing to more thorough integration if they are
adequately distributed. Evans consequently contends that the decisionmaking
process and the articulation of article 92 do not amount to a unidirectional
relationship going from principle to exception and focusing on competition.
Applying the rule of reason to aid that distorts competition may lead to the
prohibition of such aid, but it also reveals that competition is but a tool for
an integration policy. Regional, sectoral, and horizontal aid control analysis
unveils other requirements and a more complex framework of interactions.

   In the last chapter, the author examines the procedures related to the
control of state aid. By the term "procedures," the author means general
legislative procedures as well as remedial prescriptions and enforcement. He
describes the formation of state aid policy in the European Union. Cooperation
agreements, integrative legislation, administrative decisionmaking, and
jurisprudence are thoroughly scrutinized. Evans stresses the practical absence
of hierarchy in state aid control procedures. Interactions reflect
interdependencies in that both entail a mixture of horizontal and vertical
relationships. The author refers to certain types of legislation as "soft law."
In fact, one should refer to these as "law" whether of not they are the result
of implicit powers of the Commision. Furthermore, even though Evans does
describe most issues concerning state aid control, he neglects, in some cases,
to take a position and formulate viable answers to crucial questions. For
example, should trade associations be entitled to bring proceedings? How are the
"problems" solved when various recipients challenge a decision made under
article 93(2)? How is recovery made effective? Concerning these and similar
issues, the book could be less descriptive and more prescriptive.

   It also would have been of interest for the author to deepen his analysis on
a new area of exemption provided for by the Treaty - the official recognition of
the acceptability of state aid directed at promoting culture and heritage
conservation, an exemption that indicates new trends in state aid policy.
Finally, since the book was published, evolutions in specific areas of state aid
control have occurred. These areas include transportation; the steel industry;
agricultural and fisheries products; restructuring of firms in difficulty; and
export-credit insurance.

AIDS Projects, B.A., Yale University 1982; J.D., Harvard Law School, 1986.  My
work at the ACLU during the 1987-1988 academic year was supported in part by a
Harvard Fellowship in Public Interest Law.  I would like to thank Nan D. Hunter
and Gerald Frug for their helpful comments and suggestions.  This review would
not have been possible without the thoughts, ideas, suggestions, edits, and most
of all, encouragement, of Marc Elovitz, for whom it is written.

 LEXISNEXIS SUMMARY:
 ...  As a gay man, I experience the AIDS crisis as the triumph of anxiety and
uncertainty. ...  The book, a collection of twenty essays, each written by
different authors, arranges the AIDS crisis into six sections: Medical
Background, Government Responses to AIDS, Private Sector Responses to AIDS, AIDS
and Health Care, AIDS in Institutions (the Military and Prisons), and the
Problems of Special Groups (intravenous drug abusers, blacks, and the lesbian
and gay communities). ...  While, as Dalton reminds us, "the principles and
procedures that will guide decision-making are . . . already in place," the
existence of such principles and procedures makes "AIDS law" no more (or less)
certain than the "AIDS crisis" itself. ...  After this discussion, the authors
conclude, "[u]nder either a contagious disease or a Tarasoff analysis, it is
likely courts will find that physicians and therapists have a duty to inform
their patients' known sexual partners if the patient has AIDS." ... AIDS and the
Law does not fully capture the efforts of people with AIDS (PWAs) to deal with
the anxiety of the AIDS crisis. ...  The affidavit is a product of the legal
system's effort to control the AIDS crisis. ...  Victor developed Toxoplasmosis,
an infection in the brain, which later progresses into AIDS dementia. ...

HIGHLIGHT: AIDS is about . . . loss of control -- control of one's bowels and
bladder, one's arms or legs, one's life . . . AIDS is the moment to moment
management of uncertainty.  It's a roller coaster ride without a seat belt.
Once this ride begins, there is never a moment when the rush of events that
swirl around you stops long enough for you to get your bearings.  AIDS is like
motion sickness except you realize that you'll never stop moving; one way or
another, you'll be dealing with AIDS for the rest of your life. . . .  It's like
standing in the middle of the New York Stock exchange at midday: buzzers and
lights flashing, everyone yelling, a million opinions, a momentum.

Association, Las Vegas, Nevada, 1986, reprinted in SURVIVING AND THRIVING WITH
AIDS: HINTS FOR THE NEWLY DIAGNOSED 39 (M. Callen ed. 1987).

 TEXT:
 [*975]  As a gay man, I experience the AIDS crisis as the triumph of anxiety
and uncertainty.  Am I infected with a deadly virus?  Are my friends?  If we
are, will we die?  How horribly?  How soon?

   Every aspect of the AIDS crisis resonates with this uncertainty.  Scientists
still debate whether the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the "cause" of
AIDS.  They are unable to explain why the virus can lay dormant and harmless for
years and why it is then suddenly activated.  Nor can scientists explain the
differing physical manifestations of HIV infection or predict what infections
will afflict which of us, when, or how.  Our doctors (for those of us who have
doctors) are unable to provide treatments  [*976]  and we have only limited
success gaining access to "experimental" drugs, which then have little success
in our bodies.  Society's primary response is concern that AIDS will "break out
into the general population," of which, presumably, we are not a part, and
where, presumably, the deaths will really matter.  Society threatens us with
quarantine, barely veiling its contempt and hatred, while promising, but rarely
delivering, compassion.

   "Now for the good news," writes editor Harlon Dalton in his preface to AIDS
and the Law: A Guide for the Public: "In putting together this book I have
become convinced (much to my surprise) that our legal system is uniquely suited
to the task at hand."  n1 Dalton's "optimism"  n2 springs from the fact that
"[t]he law's formulaic quality means, among other things, that we need not
reinvent the wheel to deal with AIDS-related legal issues. . . .  The practical
differences . . . can be apprehended and taken account of by the law with
relative ease."  n3

   AIDS and the Law is a herculean effort aimed at describing the legal aspects
of the AIDS crisis to the public.  The book, a collection of twenty essays, each
written by different authors, arranges the AIDS crisis into six sections:
Medical Background, Government Responses to AIDS, Private Sector Responses to
AIDS, AIDS and Health Care, AIDS in Institutions (the Military and Prisons), and
the Problems of Special Groups (intravenous drug abusers, blacks, and the
lesbian and gay communities).  The collection is introduced by a preface from
Dalton, an associate professor at Yale Law School, and by a chapter entitled "A
Little Law for Non-Lawyers," written by the book's other editor Scott Burris, a
recent graduate of Yale Law School.

   Inherent in an effort like AIDS and the Law is an attempt to order the
uncertainty and to control the anxiety that defines the AIDS crisis.  At times
this organizing effort is explicit, as in Dalton's preface; at other times it is
more subtle.  For example, existing laws are described as if they will
automatically determine the outcome of AIDS-related litigation, while
destabilizing developments, such as new laws, are submerged.  Despite its
"organizing" impulse, AIDS and the Law also captures the indeterminacy and
contradiction of AIDS and the legal system.  n4 Litigative outcomes are
described as unpredictable and the destabilizing consequences of changing laws
are acknowledged.

    [*977]  This essay explores the manner in which AIDS and the Law struggles
to order the uncertainty of AIDS-related law.  The first section focuses on AIDS
-related litigation; the second section on AIDS-related legislation.  My point
in these sections is that one of the many values  n5 of AIDS and the Law is the
manner in which the tension between order and uncertainty is reflected and
played out in the book.  In the third section, I discuss a parallel attempt to
find order in and to control the AIDS crisis -- the efforts of people with AIDS
to overcome victimization and to take control of their lives.  "We must fight,"
Michael Callen writes, "to retain as much control over our lives as possible."
n6 The fourth section is an example of the way these two efforts to control AIDS
(the legal system and the AIDS empowerment movement) intersect.  By drawing an
analogy between these efforts, I attempt to demonstrate that another value of
AIDS and the Law is that the book's struggle to "organize" and "control" AIDS
law coincides with the struggle of people with AIDS to "order" and "control"
AIDS itself.

   I.  THE UNCERTAINTY OF AIDS-RELATED LITIGATION

   Much of what constitutes AIDS law, and thus AIDS and the Law, is constructed
from existing law.  n7 The chapters of AIDS and the Law discuss how AIDS will be
incorporated into a wide range of traditional legal fields, from public health
and criminal law to torts, labor, landlord/tenant, and insurance law.  AIDS and
the Law is essentially a march through these legal subjects, showing how
analogous precedents have been, or might be, applied to AIDS-related situations.

   At times, AIDS and the Law depicts these applications as "formulaic" and
their outcomes as, therefore, inevitable.  n8 For instance, Dalton explains:

   The law's formulaic quality means, among other things, that we need not
reinvent the wheel to deal with AIDS-related legal issues.  As chapter after
chapter makes clear, the institutional and conceptual  [*978]  framework for
dealing with such issues already exists; the principles and procedures that will
guide decision-making are, for the most part, already in place.  Analogous
situations abound, from cases involving sexual transmission of genital herpes to
attempts to quarantine persons with bubonic plague; from cases involving
schoolchildren infected with the hepatitis B virus to efforts to round up
prostitutes to stem the spread of syphilis.  Perhaps the most important guiding
light is the explosion of statutes and cases addressing discrimination against
the disabled and against people who are perceived as disabled.  n9

   Although Dalton is correct that "analogous situations abound," what AIDS and
the Law also depicts is not the "ease" with which AIDS can be "taken account of"
by the legal system, but rather how indeterminate the applications of existing
areas of law may be to this new situation.

   A.  The Indeterminacy of Existing Law

   Consider, for example, Dalton's "most important guiding light,"  n10 -- "the
explosion of statutes and cases addressing discrimination against the disabled."
n11 Much of what constitutes AIDS law is built around the protections granted by
section 504 of the Vocational Rehabilitation Act of 1973,  n12 which considers
people with AIDS to be disabled persons.  For instance, as AIDS and the Law
makes clear, HIV-infected schoolchildren and employees have successfully
challenged their removal from the classroom and workplace by invoking section
504.  n13 But the very applicability of section 504 to AIDS (not to mention how
cases would be decided) remained largely uncertain until a 1987 Supreme Court
decision, School Board of Nassau County v. Arline,  n14 involving a tubercular
school  [*979]  teacher,  n15 held that persons with contagious diseases could
be considered "handicapped" within the meaning of the Act.

   Arline stands for the proposition that section 504 protects persons with
AIDS.  Yet, open questions concerning disability law still abound: are
asymptomatic HIV-infected persons  n16 "disabled" within the meaning of section
504?  n17 Is an HIV-infected person not "otherwise qualified" solely  [*980]
because of her infection?  n18 To what extent will courts force employers and
others to make "reasonable accommodations" for people with AIDS?  n19 Thus,
while federal and state laws exist, and generally cover people with AIDS,
application of these laws to AIDS cases is far from formalistic.  n20

   This indeterminacy is illustrated by AIDS and the Law's several discussions
of whether disability law would prevent employers from requiring  [*981]  HIV
tests as a condition of employment.  Arthur Leonard, in his comprehensive
chapter on AIDS in the workplace, writes:

   Generally, handicap discrimination statutes are interpreted to forbid
discriminatory use of tests, which means that employees who are members of a
protected group may not be singled out for special testing not uniformly given
to all employees or applicants. . . .  However, there seems to be no general
prohibition of nondiscriminatory medical testing in the private sector.  Apart
from those few jurisdictions which have specifically banned the use of antibody
testing, and the restrictions noted under the Rehabilitation Act and comparable
state and local regulations on the use of test results, it seems that employers
are free to test without violating state and local handicap discrimination laws,
although some local enforcement agencies have taken a different view of the
matter.  n21

   In a parallel discussion of the same subject in "Screening Workers for AIDS,"
n22 Mark Rothstein writes that:

   The legality of various approaches to testing is no more settled than is
their medical necessity. . . .  Many state handicap-discrimination laws are
worded quite generally and have not yet been interpreted judicially or
administratively.  Thus, it is not clear whether testing itself is generally
illegal, though it is widely believed that the use of antibody test results in
employment decision making is illegal absent a showing of job-relatedness.  n23

   Thus, Leonard concludes that "it seems that employers are free to test,"  n24
while Rothstein concludes that "it is widely belived that the use of antibody
test results . . . is illegal."  n25

   Even more interesting than the differing emphases of the authors'
conclusions, is the carefully crafted language they use to frame these
conclusions.  Neither author is being evasive.  The point is that the law
governing this critical AIDS-related issue is simply not predictable.  n26
While, as Dalton  [*982]  reminds us, "the principles and procedures that will
guide decision-making are . . . already in place,"  n27 the existence of such
principles and procedures makes "AIDS law" no more (or less) certain than the "
AIDS crisis" itself.

   B.  The Unpredictability of The Application of Judicial Precedent

   Similar to the issues raised when applying an existing statute to a new field
of law are those raised when applying judicial precedents to AIDS for the first
time.  For example, in AIDS and the Law's chapter entitled "Doctors and
Patients,"  n28 authors Belitsky and Solomon examine a physician's duty to warn
her patient's sexual partners of the patient's HIV infection.  The authors
consider the doctor's ethical and legal responsibility to safeguard the
patient's right to confidentiality.  They then proceed to analyze the Court's
decision in Tarasoff v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal.,  n29 and its subsequent
applicability to cases involving contagious diseases.  After this discussion,
the authors conclude, "[u]nder either a contagious disease or a Tarasoff
analysis, it is likely courts will find that physicians and therapists have a
duty to inform their patients' known sexual partners if the patient has AIDS."
n30 While the authors' discussion is a helpful and concise summary of this area
of the law, their conclusion is notably gauged in ambiguity ("it is likely").

   This ambiguity reflects the sense of indeterminacy which governed a Tarasoff
-like case that arose in Kansas in May of 1988.  The ACLU was contacted by an
individual who had been told by his health care providers, an HMO, that it was
about to notify his estranged wife of his HIV test results.  The man had been
separated from his wife for nearly two years (since October of 1986) and had not
had sex with her during that time.  He tested positive for the HIV antibody in
March of 1987.  The HMO subsequently tested his wife on two occasions, in the
spring and fall of 1987, and knew she was uninfected.  Nonetheless, in May of
1988, fourteen months after it initially discovered the man's positive test
result, the HMO announced that it was going to notify the wife.

    [*983]  At times during this case, the HMO's lawyers expressed their concern
as a fear of Tarasoff liability, rather than as a consideration for the wife's
safety, if they did not warn the wife, they feared the clinic might itself face
liability some day.  There was, however, little reason to warn the wife.  There
was not threat of imminent harm to her since the couple was separated and thus
the infected husband was not likely to have sexual relations with her.
Additionally, since the HMO had tested the wife and knew her to be uninfected,
it knew that she was not an unknowing carrier of the virus.  Finally, although
the HMO claimed the husband's HIV infection should have affected his visitation
rights, nothing in the medical literature suggested that visitation posed any
threat to the children.  n31 There was not, therefore, any logical reason to
notify the wife of the estranged husband's HIV-test results.  We expected a
court would side with the husband, notwithstanding the principles announced in
Tarasoff and its progeny.

   In May of 1988, a Kansas court issued a temporary restraining order
prohibiting the HMO from divulging the confidential information to the estranged
wife, and in October the court permanently enjoined the HMO from disclosing the
plaintiff's test results.  n32

   While the Kansas case is a meaningful precedent supporting the
confidentiality of HIV-related information, its value outside of the peculiar
and narrow facts of the case is difficult to assess.  n33 If the HMO had not
known that the wife was uninfected and suspected that she might be an unknowing
carrier of the virus, or, if the husband and wife still engaged in sexual
relations with one another and there had been some threat of imminent infection
to the wife, the case might have been decided very differently.

   Despite the existence of guiding principles and precedent borrowed from other
areas of the law, the outcomes of these types of cases are not, as with the HIV
testing situation, predictable in any certain or determinant fashion.  Again,
the "existence" of such principles and procedures  [*984]  does not necessarily
relieve the pervasive sense of uncertainty which characterizes AIDS and the Law,
and the AIDS crisis itself.

   C.  The Existence of Conflicting Applicable Laws or Precedent

   Differing interpretations of existing law or precedent, such as those
presented in the section 504 cases and in the Kansas case, are not the only
causes of indeterminacy in AIDS law.  The possible applicability of different
laws and/or precedents creates a third area of uncertainty in the legal system.

   A case litigated by the ACLU in South Carolina is illustrative.  In March of
1988, South Carolina's Department of Health and Environmental Control
"quarantined" an HIV-infected woman at the state mental hospital.  The
Department declared that, in addition to being infected with HIV, the
quarantined woman was mentally incompetent, an intravenous drug user, and a
prostitute, and thus a threat to the public health.  Although depriving "Robin"
n34 of her liberty, the state had not given her notice or an opportunity to be
heard before it isolated her.

   Three South Carolina commitment statutes could have been applied to Robin's
situation.  Two were fairly modern laws, dealing with the involuntary commitment
of mentally incompetent persons  n35 and chemically dependent persons.  n36 Both
of these laws contained significant procedural protections.  The third statute,
dating from the turn of the century, allowed for the indefinite quarantine of an
individual without any procedural protections simply upon a finding by the
Department that the person presented a threat to public health.  n37

   Not surprisingly, Robin had been committed pursuant to the third statute.  A
habeas corpus petition was prepared seeking to have Robin's commitment declared
unconstitutional and thereby to force her release.  n38 In the meantime, though
not as a consequence of this case, the South Carolina legislature passed a new
quarantine statute after the commencement of the ACLU's efforts on Robin's
behalf, which created yet another avenue under which the state could act against
Robin.  n39

    [*985]  Ultimately, Robin's case was decided without the ruling as to the
constitutionality of the quarantine statute.  Despite the existence of the
quarantine order, the Department eventually sought to have Robin involuntarily
committed pursuant to the chemical dependence statute, as well, and she was
granted the state court hearing called for by that statute.  At that hearing,
the ACLU was able to show that there was no evidence in the record supporting
commitment on these grounds, and Robin was released, although she was
involuntarily ordered to undergo outpatient drug treatment.  The state dissolved
the quarantine order.  In sum, this case exemplifies the indeterminacy that can
be created, although the "principles and procedures for decision-making are, for
the most part, already in place,"  n40 by the possible application of a variety
of such principles and procedures.

   In AIDS and the Law, Frederic C. Kass's chapter, "Schoolchildren with AIDS,"
n41 provides an insightful exploration of this theme.  Kass reviews three cases
involving a single issue -- whether schoolchildren with AIDS should be admitted
to the classroom -- each of which turned on a different legal issue.  In one
case from Queens, New York,  n42 section 504 was viewed as the governing
statute: "The court ruled that automatic exclusion of schoolchildren with AIDS
would have violated [section 504]."  n43 In a second case from Indiana,  n44 the
Education for All Handicapped Children Act (EHA),  n45 was viewed as the
governing statute.  n46 In a third case from New Jersey,  n47 the admission of
two HIV-infected children turned largely on whether state administrative
regulations had been properly enacted.  n48

   In some circumstances, choices among the statutes and regulations can lead to
contradictory results.  For example, the procedural requirements of the EHA and
section 504 differ greatly: the EHA requires exhaustion of administrative
remedies (which can be quite long and time consuming) before a case can be
brought in federal court, while the Rehabilitation Act has been interpreted as
not requiring exhaustion.  n49 Because of these exhaustion requirements, school
boards tend to promote the applicability of  [*986]  the EHA and use it as a
defense in section 504 cases, asking federal courts to dismiss section 504 cases
for failure to exhaust EHA administrative procedures.  n50

   A second example of overlapping and possibly contradictory extant legal
standards occurs with regard to the issue of antibody testing by the government.
Such testing may be challenged as a constitutional violation arising under the
Fourth Amendment and as a legal question arising under the Rehabilitation Act.
n51 In Glover,  n52 the district court halted a testing program on
constitutional grounds, without comment on the plaintiffs' section 504 claims.
On appeal,  n53 the state argued that the court must have decided the
Rehabilitation Act issue against the plaintiffs, otherwise it would never have
reached the constitutional question.  Thus, at present, one could read the
applicable statute and the applicable constitutional standard as creating
conflicting results.

   In sum, existing statutes and precedent are, as AIDS and the Law quite
proficiently shows, the obvious materials upon which to draw in AIDS-related
legal situations.  And, as editor Dalton insists, these extant legal materials
provide a structure and framework for the manner in which AIDS-related law will
develop.  However, AIDS and the Law also illustrates the indeterminacy that is
inherent in the applications of these existing materials -- the uncertainty of
initial applications of existing, and sometimes conflicting, laws and precedents
to AIDS-related situations.  While there is truth in Dalton's statement that
"the practical differences [between AIDS and old problems] . . . can be
apprehended and taken account of by the law with relative ease,"  n54 there is
truth in the converse, as well.  The law does not provide an organized oasis
outside the social reality of the AIDS crisis, but rather helps form, and is
itself formed by, the governing uncertainty of that social reality.

   II.  THE DESTABILIZING CONSEQUENCES OF NEW LAWS

   As if there was not enough indeterminacy in attempting to apply existing
legal doctrines to AIDS, state legislatures and Congress are constantly changing
the available legal materials.

   In 1987, more than 450 bills concerning AIDS were introduced in state  [*987]
legislatures across the country.  n55 Despite the often haphazard quality of
many of these state legislative responses,  n56 they have largely shaped the
rules governing relationships between persons with AIDS and society.  How these
rules will be enforced and how they will affect the social relationships they
are intended to govern is undetermined.  n57 Yet, the contribution of state
legislatures to the development of AIDS-related law is difficult to overstate.

   One of the overwhelming difficulties of compiling a book about a new and
changing area of law, and AIDS-related law in particular, is how to take account
of these legislative developments.  The focus of AIDS and the Law is litigative,
not legislative.  The book does not include a chapter or section which attempts
to summarize these legislative initiatives.  This omission implies that the
legal materials to be drawn on already exist.  n58 However, the book also
contains a competing vision of a state of affairs that may soon change with the
passage of new legislation.

   For instance, new regulations significantly altered one section of AIDS
[*988]  and the Law between the time the book was completed and the time it was
published.  A "NOTE" at the beginning of AIDS and the Law's excellent section on
intravenous drug abusers reads simply: "As this book went to press, the federal
confidentiality regulations discussed at pp.  266-76 were being renumbered and
significantly revised, effective Aug.  10, 1987.  The new regulations, which
place fewer restrictions on the release of information, appear at 52 Fed. Reg.
21,796 (1987)."  n59 The NOTE describing the changes in the confidentiality
regulations is admirable and brings the reader as up to date as possible.

   Similarly, the recent passage of congressional amendments to the Fair Housing
Act,  n60 has substantially affected the subject matter of Daniel Mandelker's
chapter on AIDS and Housing.  These amendments extend the Fair Housing Act's
protections to handicapped persons and specifically to people with AIDS, ARC,
and HIV infection.  n61

   While these subsequent legislative developments affect the value of the legal
discussions in these chapters, other chapters, specifically, John F.  Decker's
chapter on Prostitution as a Public Health Issue  n62 and Jane Aiken's chapter
on Education as Prevention,  n63 appear to be geared toward ongoing legislative
debates.  Decker summarizes state legislative proposals concerning AIDS and
prostitution and considers the medically unwarranted reactions of most of these
measures.  His chapter was one of the first published arguments  n64 rationally
examining the relationship between prostitution and the spread of AIDS.  n65

    [*989]  Similarly, in her chapter on Education as Prevention,  n66 Jane
Aiken appears to have foreseen Congress' enactment of the "Helms Amendment"  n67
and has lucidly addressed its impact and legality.  The Helms Amendment provides
that no funds from the Centers for Disease Control "shall be used to provide
AIDS education, information, or prevention materials and activities that promote
or encourage, directly, homosexual activities."  n68 Aiken's chapter is one of
the first considerations of the legal issues, such as the First Amendment
ramifications, raised by the Helms Amendment, although it was written before the
Amendment was proposed.  n69 Larry Gostin's chapter on Traditional Public Health
Strategies  n70 also attempts to deal with ongoing legislative issues and the
legality of many of these solutions.

   Just as the publication of AIDS and the Law was affected, and in some cases
superceded, by breaking legislative developments, so to litigative efforts to
define AIDS law are also prone to these external influences.  For example, in
the South Carolina case described above, the ACLU busily prepared a case
challenging the constitutionality of a statute which was about to be displaced
by a new statute.  Similarly, coincidental to the events in the Kansas case
discussed above, Kansas passed a new law concerning the confidentiality of HIV
test results.  n71 This subsequent, external development impacted the outcome of
the case,  n72 though it was beyond the control of those involved in the case
and was not a consequence of the case.

   These external, often legislative, developments largely constitute what is
becoming AIDS law, and clearly demonstrate that this body of the law is
constantly changing.  AIDS and the Law, in its attempt to bring order to  [*990]
AIDS law, in some places submerges these destabilizing influences; in other
places, the book's attempt to control the AIDS crisis involves recognition and
anticipation of these future developments.  This inclusion of the tension
between order and uncertainty in AIDS-related law is one of the strengths of the
book.  It is a strength because it reflects the general desire of the legal
system to order uncertainty, and it is a strength because it parallels another,
non-legal, effort to order the specific uncertainty of the AIDS crisis -- the
efforts of people with AIDS to come to grips with AIDS itself.

   III.  THE PWA EMPOWERMENT MOVEMENT

   AIDS and the Law does not fully capture the efforts of people with AIDS
(PWAs) to deal with the anxiety of the AIDS crisis.  This absence is
understandable.  The voices of people with AIDS were not loudly heard nor was
their plight widely understood at the time AIDS and the Law was published, and a
book such as AIDS and the Law is, like its legal conclusions, bound to a
specific historical moment.  "Such are the trials," editor Dalton writes, "of
trying to produce a book about an epidemic when its collateral consequences
continue to multiply."  n73

   In his preface to AIDS and the Law, Dalton describes a meeting shortly before
the book's publication at which a newly recruited student asked: "Do you have a
chapter on the licensing of new drugs?"  n74 With "mild embarrassment," Dalton
answered the student: "[I]n soliciting the manuscripts fifteen months earlier,
we had not anticipated how important the issue would become."  n75 In fact, this
subject, which was coming to the fore just as AIDS and the Law was being
published, is tied to the development of the PWA empowerment movement.  The
movement represents the formal expression of people with AIDS' attempts at
ordering their ordeal, and this movement interestingly parallels, and sometimes
intersects with, AIDS and the Law's attempts to order the legal aspects of the
AIDS crisis.

   The People with AIDS empowerment movement dates to the Second National AIDS
Forum held at the National Lesbian and Gay Health Conference in Denver in June
of 1983.  PWAs at the conference ratified the "Founding Statement of People with
AIDS/ARC" (the "Denver Principles"),  n76 which included recommendations for
health care professionals, people with AIDS, and the public.  The
recommendations are perhaps best summarized by the statement which accompanies
them: "We  [*991]  condemn attempts to label us as 'victims', which implies
defeat, and we are only occasionally 'patients' which implies passivity,
helplessness and dependence upon the care of others.  We are 'people with AIDS.
'"  n77

   The purpose of the PWA empowerment movement and of the Denver Principles is
also summarized by the Mission Statement of the National Association of People
with AIDS (NAPWA):

   We are people with AIDS and people with AIDS-Related Complex (ARC) who can
speak for ourselves to advocate for our own causes and concerns.  We are your
sons and daughters, your brothers and sisters, your family, friends and lovers.
As people now living with AIDS and ARC, we have a unique and essential
contribution to make to the dialogue surrounding AIDS and we will actively
participate with full and equal credibility to help shape the perception and
reality surrounding this disease.

   We do not see ourselves as victims.  We will not be victimized.  We have the
right to be treated with respect, dignity, compassion and understanding.  We
have the right to lead fulfilling, productive lives -- to live and die with
dignity and compassion.  n78

   The PWA empowerment movement has effected the following types of changes,
each with its own legal consequences.  First, on an individual level, many PWAs
have upset the traditional roles assigned by our society to "doctors" and
"patients" and, in so doing, have challenged the existing legal relationships
between doctors and patients.  The Denver Principles, for instance, call on
health care professionals to "[g]et in touch with their feelings (e.g., fears,
anxieties, hopes, etc.) about AIDS, and not simply deal with AIDS
intellectually."  n79 Furthermore, the Principles recognize the rights of PWAs
to "full explanations of all medical procedures and risks, to choose or refuse
their treatment modalities, to refuse to participate in research without
jeopardizing their treatment and to make informed decisions about their lives."
n80 These principles have been effectuated in a number of ways.  For instance,
PWAs regularly publish newsletters which share information about doctors and
about treatments.  n81 Similarly, PWAs have formed "Buyers Clubs" which have
arranged for  [*992]  the purchase and distribution of experimental treatments
to PWAs and PWARCs.

   The legal consequences of this type of empowerment are typified by the
following example.  In the spring of 1988, the ACLU was contacted by an
individual (Steve)  n82 who had been a participant in an experimental drug trial
which had ended in February.  Steve believed he had been induced into entering
the trial two years ago with, inter alia, the promise that he could continue
receiving the treatment indefinitely and without cost at the conclusion of the
trial if he so desired.  He had been faithful to the experimental drug for two
years, even ignoring his doctors' advice to go on AZT during a period of
particular illness, and he now wanted to continue receiving it although the
trial's results had been disappointingly inconclusive.

   The company, however, said that it could no longer provide Steve with the
treatment, because, among other things, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
would not allow it to make assertions about the drug's efficacy.  The company
feared that providing the drug to Steve would be tantamount to claiming that it
worked.  Moreover, the doctors, who were involved with the drug trial and who
continued to be Steve's treating physicians, did not share his recollection of
the promises that were made at the beginning of the trial.  They also did not
believe the drug was effective and were not enthusiastic about Steve continuing
treatment.

   Despite his doctors' doubts about the drug and their doubts about his memory
of the promises that were made, Steve wanted to continue on the treatment and
was convinced that he had been promised that he could.  He found the strength to
empower himself, to challenge his doctors, whom he generally trusted and relied
on to provide him care, and to challenge a large drug company.  He won.  The
case was settled with a series of phone calls to the company's headquarters, and
Steve has been supplied with the experimental treatment free of charge ever
since.  Although Steve's case never resulted in formal litigation, it
nonetheless raised legal issues involving contract law and FDA law which were
not anticipated when AIDS and the Law was published.

   A second aspect of this movement is the collectivization of PWAs and persons
concerned about AIDS, particularly gay men and lesbians.  This collectivization
has created unique care communities which have radically reconceptualized the
ways in which we think about "family" and "caring." For instance, every large
city in the country now has an AIDS service organization.  These organizations
typically provide a wide range of services for PWAs in their area, many of which
are not provided by the government or by traditional health care providers.
Such services include  [*993]  the provision of "buddies" to people with AIDS,
and the provision, in a sense, of families to people who have often been
abandoned by their own.

   AIDS service organizations also provide financial services to people with
AIDS free of charge.  Such services generally include information about, and
help receiving, benefits such as (in New York City) social security disability,
supplemental security income, unemployment compensation, Medicaid, New York City
income maintenance welfare, New York State disability, insurance, and housing.
In addition, legal centers at AIDS organizations offer services such as the
preparation of wills and powers of attorney and referrals for larger legal
problems like discrimination cases.

   AIDS and the Law does not address these issues; it is very consciously not a
legal handbook for people with AIDS.  For example, although one chapter is
authored by Mark Senak,  n83 who was the legal director of the Gay Men's Health
Crisis in New York for a number of years, it does not deal with the kinds of
legal work done for PWAs by GMHC, but is a general history of the gay rights
movement.  Similarly, Mark Scherzer's Insurance  n84 chapter is an overview of
the insurance industry, not a primer on how to help people with AIDS find
insurance and gain access to benefits.  n85 Obviously, a choice was made to
focus on these larger issues rather than to provide direct advice for PWAs and
their lawyers.  This choice was doubtlessly affected by, among other factors,
the time period in which the choice was made, namely, before PWA empowerment
brought issues directly involving PWAs to the center of concern.

   Beyond individual empowerment and collectivization, a third aspect of PWA
empowerment has been that PWA groups and AIDS service organizations have become
forceful lobbies on issues of importance to them.  The legal consequence of such
lobbying is, quite simply, that the AIDS-related laws emanating from state
legislatures and Congress have come to reflect the concerns of PWAs and AIDS
advocates.

   In addition to traditional lobbying and advocacy, PWAs have taken their anger
about government inaction and societal indifference to the streets -- picketing,
demonstrating, and engaging in civil disobedience around issues of importance to
them.  In March of 1987, an AIDS activist group was formed in New York City and
began meeting weekly at the Lesbian and Gay Community Service Center calling
itself ACT-UP, or the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power.  A year and a half later,
the weekly ACT-UP meetings are attended by several hundred people.  Similar
[*994]  groups have sprung up around the country, loosely collected under a
national umbrella organization, ACT-NOW (AIDS Coalition to Network, Organize and
Win).

   ACT-UP has taken lawyers who work with AIDS and with people with AIDS into
areas of law not contemplated when AIDS and the Law was published.  For
instance, in March of 1988, to celebrate their first anniversary, 110 members of
ACT-UP were arrested for sitting, nonviolently, in the middle of the street
during the morning Wall Street rush hour.  They were protesting the government's
lack of interest in developing AIDS therapies and did so on Wall Street to
denounce what they viewed as Wall Street's acquiescence to this indifference.
Their posters read, "The Federal Interest Rate on AIDS -- 0%."

   The 110 ACT-UP members were charged with disorderly conduct and resisting
arrest.  They pleaded not guilty and moved to dismiss the charges "in the
interest of justice," basing the motion on an argument that their actions were a
justified response to this country's AIDS policy.  What follows is the Affidavit
of ACT-UP member Michael Cowing, which supported the protesters' motion to
dismiss.  n86 The affidavit is a product of the legal system's effort to control
the AIDS crisis.  It also represents the expression of a person in the AIDS
community struggling to take control of the AIDS crisis.  It is, as such, an
intersection of the movements described in this essay.  I have reprinted the
affidavit in full because I believe such a document is crucial to understanding
AIDS law, yet such a voice cannot be found in AIDS and the Law.

   IV.  AFFIDAVIT OF MICHAEL COWING: "WHY I PARTICIPATED IN THE CIVIL
DISOBEDIENCE ACTION ON MARCH 25, 1988"

   Richard died in July, 1984.  He had just turned 30.  He was an historian and
had one of the finest minds I have ever known.  He was diagnosed with AIDS
-related pneumonia and fourteen days later he was gone.  His last two weeks were
agonizing for him.  That was 1984.  So little was known about the disease -- so
few drugs were available.  Had more treatments been available, he might have
been saved.  He can never be replaced.

   Victor became ill in the Spring of 1986.  He had a persistent cough and
sporadic fevers.  Eventually he became too sick to work and had to stay home
confined to bed.  His money ran out and he lost his apartment so he had to go
home to Ohio to stay with his family -- they didn't even want him.  They were
ignorant about AIDS and they were afraid.  It was 1986 and very little
information was available about the disease.  Although responsible physicians
and  [*995]  scientists had gone on record as stating that the AIDS virus was
not casually transmitted, the information was not made available to the general
public on a widespread basis.  Victor developed Toxoplasmosis, an infection in
the brain, which later progresses into AIDS dementia.  His mind completely
disintegrated and he died in September of that same year, but by then he was no
longer the friend I had known.  The Victor I had come to know and love was a
gentle, brilliant man.  He was a linguist and had a curiosity about life and
people that was immediately disarming.  He was 36 years old.  His death was a
terrible waste.  He might have held on till better therapies became available
but then it was 1986 and so little was known -- so few effective treatments were
available.

   Kenneth was a funny kind of guy.  He had been confused the last couple of
years, seemed to have no direction, didn't know what he wanted out of life.
Then in the summer of 1986, he decided to go to law school.  Suddenly, he was
filled with purpose and drive.  He applied for and was accepted by Cardoza Law
School and enrolled that fall.  He immediately took to the curriculum and
established a 4.0 grade point average that he maintained until he left school.
In January of 1987, he came down with a terrible flu that he just couldn't
shake.  He got weaker and weaker and lost a frightening amount of weight.  He
was diagnosed with AIDS in mid-February.  By the first week of March, he was
gone.  He had AIDS-related pneumonia and didn't respond to the treatments that
were available.  It happened so fast we didn't even realize that we'd lost him
until after the funeral was over.  Ken was one of the most loving people I've
ever been privileged to know.  He was keenly interested in the spiritual side of
our experience and was always trying to make us see the deeper meaning of
things, the value in ourselves.  Not a day goes by that I don't think of him.
It's still hard to accept that he's not a part of my life anymore.  I believe
that he would have gotten through the pneumonia, would have finished law school,
if more had been known about how to treat AIDS -- if more effective drugs had
been available.

   Eddis was diagnosed with lymphoma in January of 1987.  He started radiation
and chemotherapy treatments right away and his doctors said he had a better than
even chance of beating it.  He certainly had the right attitude, that's for
sure.  He just made up his mind that he was strong enough to deal with whatever
came along.  He responded well to the treatment at first.  Then in May he
developed Kaposi's Sarcoma, an AIDS-related cancer.  Even then his general
health was good and his spirits stayed high.  His friends were shattered by the
news but he kept our hopes alive and made us laugh at our own fears.  Suddenly
in September, he came down with pneumonia and was rushed to NYU Medical Center.
He was placed on a respirator and was delirious for four weeks.  Of course he
couldn't talk to us and the pain killers made him so groggy that most days he
couldn't even write legibly to communicate his needs.  He suffered terribly then
and I didn't know whether to pray for his recovery or for a release from the
agony he was in.  The thing none of us counted on was his incredible fighting
ability.  He scribbled on his pad one  [*996]  day that it wasn't time for him
to go yet and that we should just dig in for the duration.  And he was right.
After nearly ten weeks on the respirator, he was strong enough to breathe on his
own again.  His doctors said that they had never seen a person come through as
he had.  They confided in us that they never expected him to come off the
respirator and certainly never to leave the hospital alive.  His indominatable
spirit proved everyone wrong.  He recovered from the pneumonia and was released
from the hospital in early December.  I could see, however, during my visits
with him in the ensuing weeks that his whole body was slowly falling apart.  But
the power of his love and acceptance and courage never wavered for a moment.  He
died quietly at 4:16 p.m. on Tuesday, February 23rd of this year.  His last
words were, 'I'm not afraid.  Don't worry.' I know that had more treatments been
available, Eddis would still be here sharing his lovely light in our lives.  It
is now 1988 and another friend is gone.  I cannot accept that we have come such
a little way in this fight -- that since I lost Richard in July of 1984 there
are still so few drugs and treatments available for AIDS.

   I participated in the civil disobedience action on March 24, 1988 on Broadway
and Rector Streets because I believe that if we all raise our voices loud enough
and long enough, the federal health agencies and the government bureaucrats who
are directing the AIDS effort will recognize that they can and must try harder,
that the solution can be found if we spare no effort in finding more and better
treatments for this horrible disease.  I believe it is my absolute duty to bring
this issue to the attention of the public, the government, the courts until such
a solution is found.  I must add for the record that my warrant charges me with
thrashing my arms and legs while being carried to the bus by the police.  That
is not true.  I was not there that morning to engage in physical violence of any
sort.  I went completely limp when the officers began to drag me away and was
tossed into the bus on my head rather than even being given the option to stand
and walk on board when we reached the vehicle.  My neck, arms and back were
badly bruised as a result.

   My friends' deaths, and the deaths of the more than 34,000 others who have
succumbed to AIDS, cannot and must not have been in vain.  With the accumulated
pain of so many losses, I have accepted the knowledge and the responsibility
that I, as an individual, must do everything within my power to ensure that
others will not have to endure the kind of anguish and torment that my friends
did.  It is the most loving tribute to their memories that I can think of.  n87

   V.  CONCLUSION

   As a lawyer, when I "accept[ed] the knowledge and responsibility that I . . .
[had to] do everything within my power to ensure that others [would]  [*997]
not have to endure the kind of anguish and torment that my friends did,"  n88 I,
naturally, looked to the law.  I came to do AIDS-related legal work because I
thought that such work would give me an opportunity to "control" AIDS in some
way.  It loomed as a constructive alternative to the constant worrying about
myself, checking my body for lesions and my mouth for thrush, and about my
friends, which had characterized my initial reaction to AIDS.  I looked to the
law as a place where I could bring some sort of order to the uncertainty and
anxiety that defines my life as a gay man in the AIDS era.

   In much the same way, the editors and authors and the Yale AIDS Law Project
have attempted through AIDS and the Law to come to grips with the anxiety of the
AIDS crisis.  In putting together this book, they have wrestled with the social
reality of AIDS and attempted to lay an organizing, legal framework onto that
reality.  They have done an excellent job.

   Nonetheless, AIDS resists.  While we empower ourselves to take control of it,
and while those of us who are lawyers work through the legal system to bring
order to it, AIDS continues to spread and to kill.  The indeterminacy, the
anxiety, and the confusion of the AIDS crisis is embodied in AIDS-related legal
discourse.  When seeking to order that discourse, we should not submerge AIDS'
turbulence, but rather should ensure that it continues to inform our efforts.

helpfulness as a tool in planning litigative and legislative strategies -- are
lauded time and again throughout this essay.  They cannot be overstated.

   In addition, though I feel unqualified to comment on whether AIDS and the Law
succeeds in its attempt to explain AIDS law to non-lawyers, the book's editors
should be highly commended for their effort.  The authors of the book were
chosen and the text carefully edited so as to make the book intelligible to
non-lawyers.  While much has been written for lawyers about AIDS law, AIDS and
the Law represents the only such endeavor directed to non-lawyers.  Finally,
Professor Dalton, editor Burris, and the Yale AIDS Law Project deserve
significant praise for having concentrated on the legal issues the AIDS crisis
raises at a time when little attention was paid to such issues.

   In relevant part, the statute provides:

   No otherwise qualified individual with handicaps in the United States, as
defined in section 706(8) of this title, shall, solely by reason of his
handicap, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or
be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal
financial assistance or under any program or activity conducted by any Executive
agency or by the United States Postal Service.

Fla. 1987) (school board ordered to admit HIV-infected schoolchildren to
classroom); Chalk v. United States Dist.  Court, 840 F.2d (9th Cir. 1988)
(school ordered to reinstate HIV-infected teacher to classroom duty).




n14.  107 S. Ct. 1123 (1987). The uncertainty surrounding § 504's applicability
was fostered in large part by the Reagan Administration Justice Department.  In
1986, the Justice Department took the position that, although the Rehabilitation
Act prohibited discrimination based on the disabling effects of AIDS,
discrimination based on an employer's fear of contagion was not covered and
therefore such fear could justify an employee's dismissal.  The Supreme Court's
decision in Arline specifically repudiated the Justice Department's position,
stating "[w]e do not agree with petitioners that, in defining a handicapped
individual under § 504, the contagious effects of a disease can be meaningfully
distinguished from the disease's physical effects on a claimant in a case such
as this." Id. at 1128.

   Nonetheless, not until it was prompted by the President's AIDS Commission
some fifteen months later, see THE PRESIDENTIAL COMMISSION ON THE HUMAN
IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS EPIDEMIC, REPORT 121-23 (June 1988), and then ordered by
the White House did the Justice Department retreat from this earlier position.

Memorandum], Cover Letter from Douglas W. Kmiec, Acting Assistant Attorney
General, Office of Legal Counsel (Oct. 6, 1988).

n16.  Asymptomatic HIV-infected persons are person who test positive for the
presence of antibodies to HIV but who have developed no clinical manifestations
resulting from their HIV-infection.  Asymptomatic infection was traditionally
considered the early phase of HIV disease, with the intermediate phase being
AIDS related complex (ARC), and the final phase being acquired immune deficiency
syndrome, or AIDS.  ARC, as defined by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC),
was the presence, for three or more months, of two of a list of clinical
manifestations of disease (fever, weight loss, lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph
nodes), diarrhea, fatigue or night sweats) coupled with certain specific types
of poor blood counts, and the absence of the opportunistic infections which
delineate the onset of AIDS.  AIDS, the final breakdown of the immune system,
was defined by the CDC as the presence of certain specific opportunistic
infections which a person with a healthy immune system easily fights off.  In
particular, most people with AIDS fall prey to a pneumonia called pneumocystis
carinii pneumonia, or to a cancer entitled Kaposi's sarcoma.  These groupings
are very well described by Richard Green in AIDS and the Law. Green, The
Transmission of AIDS, in AIDS AND THE LAW 28, 30 (H. Dalton, S. Burris & Yale
AIDS Law Project eds. 1987) (citing Revisions of the Case Definition of Acquired
Immunodeficiency Syndrome for National Reporting, 34 MMWR 373, 373-375 (1985)).
Because these categories are clinically inexact and definitionally clumsy,
efforts have been undertaken to redefine AIDS as "HIV disease" and to refer to a
spectrum of HIV disease, instead of to asymptomatic HIV-infection, ARC and AIDS.
See, e.g., INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE, NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES, CONFRONTING AIDS
7 (1986); INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE, NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES, CONFRONTING AIDS:
UPDATE 1988 at 3 (1988); THE PRESIDENTIAL COMMISSION ON THE HUMAN
IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS EPIDEMIC REPORT 3 (June 1988).




n17.  The generally applicable definition of "handicap" in federal disability
law is "any person who (i) has a physical or mental impairment which
substantially limits one or more of such person's major life activities, (ii)
has a record of such impairment, or (iii) is regarded as having such
impairment." 29 U.S.C. § 706(8)(B) (1973).  Physical impairment is then defined
as, "[A]ny physiological disorder of condition, cosmetic disfigurement, or
anatomical loss affecting one or more of the following body systems:
neurological; musculoskeletal; special sense organs; respiratory, including
speech organs; cardiovascular; reproductive, digestive, genito-urinary; hemic
and lymphatic; skin; and endocrine. . . ." 45 C.F.R. § 84.3(j)(2)(i) (1987).

   The phrase "asymptomatic" might suggest that such an asymptomatically
HIV-infected person would not comport with this definition.  However, the
Justice Department recently quoted the Surgeon General of the United States as
stating:

   In addition to acute flu-like illness, early stages of the disease may
involve subclinical manifestations, i.e., impairments and no visible signs of
illness.  The overwhelming majority of infected persons exhibit detectable
abnormalities of the immune system . . . [F]rom a purely scientific perspective,
persons with HIV-infection are clearly impaired.  They are not comparable to an
immune carrier of a contagious disease such as Hepatitis B.  Like a person in
the early stages of cancer, they may appear outwardly healthy but are in fact
seriously ill.

   1988 Justice Department Memorandum, supra note 14, at 7-8 (quoting Letter
from C. Everett Koop, M.D., Surgeon General, to Douglas W. Kmiec, Acting
Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel (July 29, 1988)).

   Further, the physical impairment suggested by the Surgeon General is
generally considered to limit major life activities associated, for instance,
with procreation and intimacy.  Id. at 9-13.  Thus, asymptomatic HIV-infected
persons should be considered handicapped persons protected by § 504.  Moreover,
asymptomatic HIV-infected persons are also often "regarded as" being
handicapped, and therefore should be protected by § 504 for that reason as well.

   Not surprisingly, the federal courts that have considered this issue have
found that asymptomatic HIV-infection is a "handicap" within the meaning of §
504.  See, e.g., Doe v. Centinella Hosp., Civ.  87-2514 (D.C. Cal. June 30,
1988) (order granting partial summary judgment holding HIV-infected individual
to be "individual with handicaps" because he was perceived as such by
defendant).  See also Ray v. School Dist. of DeSoto County, 666 F. Supp. 1524
(M.D. Fla. 1987); Thomas v. Atascadero Unified School Dist., 662 F. Supp. 376
(C.D. Cal. 1986); Local 1812 v. Dep't of State, 662 F. Supp.  50 (D.D.C. 1987).
Accord District 27 Community School Bd. v. Board of Educ., 502 N.Y.S.2d 325, 336
(Sup. Ct. 1986). However, the Supreme Court and the federal circuit courts have
not yet definitively ruled on this issue.




n18.  In Arline, the Supreme Court wrote that "[a] person who poses a
significant risk of communicating an infectious disease to others in the
workplace will not be otherwise qualified for his or her job if reasonable
accommodation will not eliminate that risk." Arline, 107 S.  Ct. 1123, 1131
n.16.

   Similarly, in passing the Civil Rights Restoration Act this year, Congress
added an amendment to the Rehabilitation Act to clarify the term "otherwise
qualified individual with handicaps" in the employment context.  The amendment
states that:

   [F]or the purpose of [29 U.S.C.] sections 503 and 504, as such sections
relate to employment, such term does not include an individual who has a
currently contagious disease or infection and who, by reason of such disease or
infection, would constitute a direct threat to the health or safety of other
individuals or who, by reason of such disease or infection, is unable to perform
the duties of the job.

   Pub. L. No. 100-259, 56 U.S.L.W. 46 (Apr. 5, 1988); 134 CONG. REC. H587-8
(daily ed. Mar. 2, 1988).

   The recent Justice Department Memorandum expounds on the "factual," and
therefore generally uncertain, nature of this inquiry:

   Based on current medical knowledge, it would seem that in most situations the
probability that the AIDS virus will be transmitted is slight, and therefore as
a matter of health and safety there will often be little, if any, justification
for treating infected individuals differently from others . . .  As the disease
progresses . . . and conditions such as ARC or "full blown" AIDS affect the
physical or mental capacity of the individual, it may well be that an
"individualized inquiry" will reveal that such person is not otherwise qualified
to participate.

   In addition, current medical knowledge does suggest the possibility of
specialized contexts where, even with respect to a person in the early stages of
the disease, a court might find an individual to be not otherwise qualified. . .
.  The inquiry in each case will be a factual one. . . .

   See 1988 Justice Department Memorandum, supra note 14 (emphasis supplied).




n19.  In Arline, the Supreme Court wrote that "[a]ccomodation is not reasonable
if it either imposes 'undue financial and administrative burdens' on a grantee,
or requires 'a fundamental alteration in the nature of [the] program.'" 107 S.
Ct. at 1131 n.17 (citations omitted).  One of the more troubling issues
concerning HIV-infected workers is whether in a small, self-insured business the
presence of an HIV-infected employee would pose such an "undue financial burden"
on the employee health plan that the company could justify denying employment to
that individual.




n20.  The indeterminacy of federal discrimination law is mirrored on the state
level.  Because § 504 applies only to recipients of federal funds, litigants
must often turn to state discrimination laws for protection against
discrimination in private employment, public accommodations, and housing.
(Housing discrimination against handicapped persons is now also actionable under
the federal Fair Housing Act.  See infra text accompanying notes 60-61.) But
before state laws can offer such protections, they each must be interpreted to
decide whether AIDS, ARC, and/or asymptomatic HIV infection are covered
disabilities; whether, for instance, nursing homes and doctors' offices are
public accommodations; who is "otherwise qualified"; and what "reasonable
accommodation" means, etc.

employees in the public workplace.  Glover v. Eastern Neb. Community Office of
Retardation, 686 F.  Supp. 243 (D. Neb.  1988), aff'd, No. 88-1678 (8th Cir.,
Feb. 6, 1989).  In Glover, the federal district court enjoined the
implementation of a state program requiring mandatory HIV antibody and hepatitis
(HBV) antibody testing of employees at a residential facility for mentally
retarded persons.  While the case included both a § 504 and a Fourth Amendment
claim, the court's decision was based on the Fourth Amendment.  686 F. Supp. at
250. The court found that the state could not articulate a compelling reason for
the testing program sufficient to justify this infringement on the employees'
constitutional rights.  See also, Anonymous Fireman v. The City of Willoughby,
No. 88-1182 (U.S.N.D.  Ohio filed May 11, 1988) (order granting plaintiff's
motion for a temporary restraining order to enjoin implementation of
municipality's HIV testing program of firemen).

to protect third persons from the potentially dangerous acts of their patients.
. . .  Tarasoff is particularly significant in the AIDS context, because the
transmission of AIDS can, in some instances, be viewed as the result of
intentional action.  Moreover, Tarasoff reaffirmed a physician's duty to protect
third parties from dangers created by a patient's illness.

which still have archaic quarantine statutes.

perspective, did contain some indicia of due process.  S.C. CODE ANN. §
44-29-115 (Law Co-op, 1988) now requires the Department, prior to isolating an
individual, to file a petition with the probate court specifying the "harm
thought probable and the factual basis for this belief." The person at issue is
entitled to representation and to an appeal.  The standard of proof is set forth
as follows: "If the court, after due notice and hearing, is satisfied that the
petition is well founded, it may order that the person be isolated." Id. The
court ordered isolation cannot last more than 90 days.

n56.  In some states, legislators have attempted to deal with a number of AIDS
-related issues in one, seemingly comprehensive, bill.  See, e.g., H.R. Res.
2067, 64th Or.  Leg. Assembly Reg. Sess.  (1987) (amending sections of Oregon
public health laws dealing with name reporting, contact tracing, isolation,
quarantine, and other preventive public health measures; requiring informed
consent for HIV testing; mandating confidentiality of HIV test results;
providing immunity from civil liability to health care providers who comply with
confidentiality provisions; directing establishment of prevalence studies and
education curricula; ordering development of plan for dealing with AIDS in
prisons; and requiring HIV testing for persons convicted of sex and drug-related
crimes).

   Other states have enacted a hodgepodge of disparate statutes.  In Illinois,
for example, at least 11 AIDS-related bills were passed at the conclusion of the
1987 Congressional term and sent to the governor for his signature.  H.R. Res.
100, 1987 Ill., Regular Sess. (requiring informed consent for HIV tests and
confidentiality of results); S. Res. 100, 1987 Ill. Leg., Regular Sess.
(requiring informed consent for HIV tests and confidentiality of results); S.
Res. 100, 1987 Ill. Leg., Regular Sess. (incentive payments for care of AIDS
patients in nursing homes); S. Res.  994, 1987 Ill. Leg.  Regular Sess.
(demonstration projects for long-term care; establishment of state AIDS
Foundation); H. Res. 736, 1987 Ill. Leg. Regular Sess. (AIDS Registry, public
employee education, expansion of Medicaid-eligible services); ILL. S. RES. 550,
1987 Ill. Leg. Regular Sess.  (AIDS education to accompany sex education); S.

license applicants, inmates, and hospital admittees); H. Res. 2044, 1987 Ill.
Leg. Regular Sess.  (testing of marriage license applicants, convicted sex and
drug offenders, and requiring notification of principals when pupils have HIV
antibodies); Ill. S. Res. 651, 1987 Ill. Leg. Regular Sess.  (authorizing
Department of Public Health to require reporting of HIV-infected individuals and
to trace sexual contacts of such persons, and codifying quarantine procedures);
H. Res. 2682, 1987 Ill. Leg.  Regular Sess. (mandating contact tracing for
HIV-infected persons and requiring name reporting of seropositive persons to
health department).  The governor then fashioned his own comprehensive AIDS bill
by choosing among those put before him as he saw fit.  "Broad AIDS Law Signed In
Illinois," N.Y. Times, Sept.  21, 1987, at B7.

   Some states have simply enacted one or two single issue AIDS-related
measures.  Louisiana, for example, passed two laws in 1987 concerning AIDS, one
criminalizing intentional exposure to the AIDS virus, H. RES. 1728, 1987 La.
Leg. Regular Sess. and a second requiring clinical testing for AIDS prior to
issuance of a marriage license, 1987 H.R. 336, LA. Leg. Regular Sess. (1987).

n65.  In contrast to this rational examination of this issue, many legislators
and commentators automatically assume the existence of some relationship between
AIDS and prostitution.  For example, the President's AIDS Commission, in its
final report, stated in a section entitled "Criminalization of HIV
Transmission," that an "Obstacle to Progress" in this area is that "[p]enalties
for prostitution are too lenient and enforcement of prostitution laws is
erratic." THE PRESIDENTIAL COMMISSION ON THE HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS
EPIDEMIC REPORT 130 (June 1988).  Accordingly, the Commission recommended that
"Prostitution laws should be strictly enforced." Id. at 131.

   This "obstacle" and the "recommendation" are accompanied by absolutely no
textual material discussing prostitution, much less any discussion attempting to
show a connection between prostitution and AIDS.  Therefore, there appears to be
no basis for the Commission's recommendation that prostitution laws should be
more strictly enforced.  Nor is there any support for the assumption inherent in
such a recommendation -- namely, that enforcement of prostitution laws would
impede the spread of HIV.

Billions wasted, aid donors warned

BYLINE: Richard Foot, Canwest News Service

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A5

LENGTH: 655  words

DATELINE: HALIFAX


HALIFAX - Billions of public dollars have been wasted on corrupt and ineffective
foreign-aid programs over the past several decades, but even so, rich countries
must fix such flaws and increase their spending on development aid, says a new
report by Oxfam International.

The report's release coincides with this week's gathering of international
development ministers from the G8 nations. Bev Oda, federal Minister of
International Cooperation, will host her G8 counterparts in Halifax for a
three-day meeting starting today. One of the issues for discussion will be Prime
Minister Stephen Harper's new foreign-aid priority of improving maternal health
care in the world's poorest countries.

The initiative, whose details are still unclear, has become politically bogged
down over whether it should include new funding for birth control and access to
abortion.

"I haven't seen a concrete public explanation of what Canada wants to do," said
Mark Fried, Oxfam Canada's policy co-ordinator. "Hopefully Canada is trying to
build a consensus on this with other G8 countries. I hope they'll confirm their
belief in it this week, and put specific, new money on the table for maternal
health."

Oxfam, an independent aid agency with decades of experience in the world's
poorest regions, says rich governments need to drastically increase funding to
maternal health care and numerous other social and economic aid projects.

Canada spends 0.33% of its gross national income on foreign aid, mostly in
Afghanistan, our largest aid recipient.

While calling for such spending to rise, Oxfam also acknowledges what a growing
chorus of critics are saying: that foreign aid efforts are often beset by waste,
corruption and outright failure. "Clearly it is impossible to argue that no aid
is wasted," says the report, 21st Century Aid: Recognizing Success and Tackling
Failure. "Aid is touched by corruption ... [and] aid dependency is an issue that
needs attention."

Oxfam agrees that too much aid spending is determined by the wishes of donors,
rather than the needs of recipients.

It says aid efforts also fail when development spending is coupled with military
goals -- such as in Afghanistan -- or handed over without accountability to
corrupt governments, or misspent on third-party consultants rather than actual
projects on the ground.

It also agrees in part with Dambisa Moyo, the influential aid critic from
Zambia, who has argued that foreign aid leads to economic dependency and
laziness in recipient countries.

But Oxfam says such problems are not reasons to abolish aid, but to fix it.

"It is true that not all aid works, and that a lot of it could work better.
[But] pulling the plug on aid now, or even in five or 10 years time, would
almost certainly result in vast increases in poverty, the collapse of burgeoning
health and education systems, and major reverses in the progress that has been
made," the report says.

Oxfam says improvements to the aid system are already underway, and it calls on
governments and donor agencies such as the UN to make aid funding more
predictable, so recipient countries can plan better.

It also says aid should increasingly be given directly to governments in
developing countries, with strict transparency and accountability conditions
requiring the money to be used to pay for public services such as health,
education and agriculture.

The report cites examples where this is working. From 2004 to 2006, 24% of all
aid money to Rwanda went directly to the national budget, allowing the Rwandan
government "to eliminate user fees for primary and lower secondary school
education, increase spending on treatment for people living with HIV and AIDS,
and provide agricultural-loan guarantees to farmers," the report says.

"Just because things are wrong you don't throw it away, you fix it," Mr. Fried
said. "I would hope the governments meeting in Halifax will reaffirm their
commitment to the aid reform process."

Access to justice and legal aid

BYLINE: MUHAMMAD ALI NEKOKARA

SECTION: Vol. 70 No. 342

LENGTH: 1019  words


ACCORDING to a report titled Understanding the Informal Justice System:
Opportunities and Possibilities for Legal Pluralism in Pakistan (2015), 98.2 per
cent of respondents in a survey opined that the poor and lower classes do not
have access to justice in the formal justice system. In the same survey, 42.8pc
felt that women and 25.2pc that landless peasants and agricultural labourers
similarly lack access. One of the reasons for limited access to the formal
justice system, as perceived by half the respondents, is the high legal fees
charged by lawyers.

Access to justice is a fundamental right. The right to legal aid is a basic one
under Article 4 (due process) and under Article 10-A (right to fair trial) of
the Constitution. An adequate legal aid system is one of the prerequisites for
access to justice This acquires more significance in the context of developing
countries due to higher levels of poverty, socioeconomic inequalities, and
serious accessibility and affordability issues.

The World Justice Project report, 2016, on the Rule of Law Index ranked
Pakistan's criminal justice system as being at 81 out of 113 countries, above
Bangladesh (97) but below India (71) and clearly way below most of the 113
countries surveyed. In the civil justice system, the same report ranked Pakistan
even worse (106/113), below Bangladesh (103), Sri Lanka (96) and India (93). On
'accessibility and affordability', Pakistan scores slightly better than India;
however, it lags behind Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.

According to an official report launched by the Ministry of Planning,
Development and Reform in June, about 40pc Pakistanis (around 60 million) live
in multidimensional poverty. Legal aid thus assumes enormous importance in the
context of access to justice where deviance and discrimination are deeply rooted
in the socio-political milieu. Ironically, after almost 70 years of its
existence, the legal aid system in Pakistan is still struggling to take root.

The legal aid system in Pakistan is still struggling to take root.

A comparative analysis of the legal aid systems of Bangladesh, India, and Sri
Lanka shows that these countries, although struggling like Pakistan in many ways
in developing effective legal aid systems, have at least established organised
aid structures.

In Bangladesh, the Supreme Court Legal Aid Office was established in 2015 to
provide legal aid in both civil and criminal cases. The structure of legal aid
in Bangladesh is organised under the watch of the Supreme Court at four levels
a) Supreme Court legal aid, b) district legal aid committees, c) upazila
(sub-division) legal aid committees and d) union council legal aid committees.

The National Legal Aid Services Authorities Act, 1987, of India provides for an
organised structure of legal aid and services. The chief justice of the Supreme
Court of India is the patron-in-chief of NALSA and a retired judge of the
Supreme Court works is its executive director. Likewise, there are state,
district and sub-divisional legal aid service authorities on a similar pattern.

In Sri Lanka, The Legal Aid Act, 1978, created the Legal Aid Commission
consisting of nine members, three nominated by the justice ministry and six by
the bar council of Sri Lanka. The LAC provides legal aid services through
regional, district committees and clinics, and also works to promote legal
awareness, training and reforms.

Existing legal aid structures in Pakistan lack ownership at the relevant levels
and performance management mechanisms. For example, district legal empowerment
committees (DLECs) constituted by the Law and Justice Commission of Pakistan
(LJCP) in 2011, in a well-meaning attempt to provide legal aid to deserving
litigants at the district level, lack a) ownership at the most relevant level -
the high courts and the district judiciary, b) effective oversight, and c)
performance management mechanisms.

Consequently, among other things, the rate of disbursement of legal aid under
the DLECs is quite disappointing; 59pc of the funds in Punjab, 91pc in Sindh,
69pc in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and 95pc in Balochistan allocated to the respective
DLECs between 2012 and 2016 unfortunately remained unspent.

The Pakistan Bar Council, under the Free Legal Aid Rules 1999, also has the
mandate to provide legal aid and create awareness about legal rights. Under
these rules, the Pakistan Bar Council manages central, provincial and district
free legal aid committees. However, these committees lack the capacity and
support to perform the roles assigned to them.

The concerned authorities need to realise their role to address the chronic
neglect of this fundamental right of the citizens. The Ministry of Law, Justice
and Human Rights has to take the lead to engage not only the provincial law
ministries and the Pakistan Bar Council but also the superior judiciary and
civil society to reform the legal aid system.

As a first step, there is a need for a national legal aid framework/authority
with clear structures from the centre and the province down to the level of each
sub-division, to ultimately each union council.

The DLEC rules need to be re-examined to improve engagement, collaboration and
performance management of the DLECs in coordination with the LJCP and the
respective high courts. This will help in building ownership of the DLECs
especially at the provincial level with the high courts and down to the district
courts.

The Pakistan Bar Council Free Legal Aid Rules, 1999, also need to be assessed
with a view to improving their structure, capacity and support through the
provision of a dedicated structure for effective arrangements for legal aid,
training, continuing legal education, sustainable funding streams and effective
oversight.

Last but not least, NGOs must also mark legal aid as a priority area to
complement public-sector initiatives.

An efficient legal aid system can significantly help improve access of
vulnerable sections to justice and reduce legal exclusion. It is crucial to
build the trust of millions of poor people with the justice sector and
importantly, with the political system of the country.

China accused of using aid programme to forge ties with autocratic regimes in
Africa;
Study claims money is creating pariah states rather than just backing them

BYLINE: Bill Corcoran

SECTION: WORLD; Pg. 10

LENGTH: 855 words


Chinese aid to Africa is creating pariah states rather than just supporting
them, claim the findings of a study that reviews the relationship between aid
and violence across the continent since the turn of the century.

And the region should expect to witness an increase in state-sponsored violence
against civil and rebel groups as Chinese aid increases, the authors of the
report, Chinese Aid and Africa's Pariah States 2000-2011, believe.

In 2012 the scale of Chinese aid to Africa increased dramatically when then
president Hu Jintao put $20 billion (EUR 18.8 billion) in loans to countries on
the table at the summit of the triennial Forum on China-Africa Co-operation -
double the amount it previously offered.

The report's authors, professors Clionadh Raleigh and Roudabeh Kishi from the
University of Sussex, said the latest data from the development sector reveal
the trend of increasing aid appears set to continue in the years ahead, with
China now accounting for 10 percent of all the aid money pumped into Africa.

China's aid delivery mechanisms has drawn criticism from traditional western
donors. Some aid experts maintain that China, via its non-interference approach
to aid provision, intentionally tries to forge relationships with African
dictatorships and regime's that commit human rights abuses.

This strategy of not interfering in African domestic affairs, say critics, is
employed by China in return for improved access to a country's natural resources
and support for its stance on issues debated and voted on at institutions like
the United Nations and the World Trade Organisation.

China denies these accusations, maintaining its engagements with African states
are for mutual benefit and that its policy is to avoid imposing political views,
ideals, or principles on to recipient countries.

Nature of its support

This is reflected in the unconditional nature of its support, but this approach
makes aid flows more fungible (not assigned to any specific programme), say the
report's authors, which allow its use to be more easily determined by regimes.

The rapid growth of China's no-strings-attached aid has also prompted
development experts, such as former UK international development secretary
Hilary Benn, to warn it is undermining efforts to create democratic and
accountable administrations.

Traditional donor aid from the West to African nations usually requires the
recipient country to adhere to conditions that support democracy, human rights,
electoral transparency and the fight against corruption.

African countries like Zimbabwe, Uganda, and Sudan are increasingly turning
towards Chinese aid when Western aid is cut off because they no longer meet the
conditions set down.

According to Raleigh and Kishi, although China isn't targeting pariah states
with aid, "it is making states into pariahs through providing resources to state
leaders who are unafraid to use repression as a means to quell competition".

"If the state has complete control over its budget, it will use its position to
bolster its capacity to repress any potential opposition in order to secure its
position," they added, citing Ethiopia, Zimbabwe and Uganda as examples.

Energy requirements

In fact, rather than targeting wayward states, the academics' data comparisons
reveal Chinese aid is predominately directed towards whichever countries
satisfies its needs - which include gaining access to new markets as well as
securing its energy requirements - with a recipient's institutional quality
having no bearing on its choices.

Indeed the study's findings conclude that autocratic regimes do not generally
receive a higher proportion of aid than other African nations. The crucial
factor for Chinese aid provision is that it must benefit China; they also found
that countries with a weaker rule of law get more aid as Chinese businesses are
allowed to flourish in such environments.

"Ghana and South Africa receive some of the largest shares of Chinese aid, as do
Sudan and Zimbabwe. Indeed, only Burkina Faso, Swaziland and the Gambia did not
receive Chinese aid from 2000-2011, owing to their stance in support of Taiwan,"
say the authors.

To compile their study, the researchers sourced the latest data on Chinese aid
to specific African countries from Aid Data, an organisation that tries to
record aid flows, and then compared its country destination against violence
that has been recorded there.

The violence data is from the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project,
which has acquired the dates and locations of all reported political violence
events in over 50 developing countries since 1997.

Interestingly, a second comparative exercise in which Chinese aid was replaced
by Western aid, but other factors such as GDP were kept the same, showed the
latter form of traditional development assistance also has its drawbacks.

"[Our] findings suggest that due to the fungible nature of Chinese aid flows,
political violence by the state to suppress domestic competition increases with
receipt of Chinese aid. This contrasts with 'traditional' aid flows which
typically incentivise insurgent rebellion," the authors noted.

Justice Minister David Ford has just published the Access to Justice Report. The
report looks at how people can access the best form of representation and what
is the the appropriate level of legal representation for their particular set of
circumstances.

This is part of a wider reform by David Ford of the justice system, to create a
justice system in Northern Ireland that meets the needs of the people of
Northern Ireland.

He is committed to the principle of people having access to justice and where
there is a need, for Government to pay for that access through legal aid.

Legal aid is the means by which Government provides financial assistance to
persons who could not otherwise afford legal advice or representation for court
proceedings.

In some instances legal aid is available free of charge and in others the person
receiving assistance is required to pay a contribution to its cost.

Legal aid enables application of the principle of equality before the law and
assists the Government in meeting its obligations under the human rights
legislation, specifically the right to a fair trial.

The Legal Aid Scheme

The Legal Aid Scheme in Northern Ireland covers legal advice, assistance and
representation in both civil and criminal proceedings. The Legal Aid Scheme is
demand led, therefore, any person who meets the statutory tests, as to their
financial means and the merits of their case, will receive legal aid. There are
broadly five types of legal aid, as follows:

1. Legal Advice and Assistance;

2. Assistance By Way of Representation;

3. Children Order;

4. Civil Legal Aid; and

5. Criminal Legal Aid.

1. Legal Advice and Assistance

Legal Advice and Assistance, popularly known as the 'Green Form' scheme, allows
a person to obtain preliminary legal advice from a solicitor on any point of
Northern Ireland law if they are financially eligible.

2. Assistance By Way of Representation

Assistance By Way of Representation (ABWOR) is an extension of the Advice and
Assistance scheme and allows a solicitor, and in some instances a barrister, to
provide representation to an assisted person in a number of civil proceedings in
the magistrates' court (for example, proceedings concerning domestic violence
and matters relating to children) and for proceedings before the Mental Health
Review Tribunal and the Parole Commissioners. Approval for ABWOR is determined
by the Northern Ireland Legal Services Commission. There is usually a financial
eligibility test to be met in order to receive ABWOR.

3. Children Order

Funding for Children Order proceedings is provided by way of ABWOR or civil
legal aid depending on the tier of court which the proceedings are before. ABWOR
and civil legal aid is provided without a financial eligibility test in special
Children Order proceedings (for example, emergency child protection
proceedings). In other Children Order proceedings, the financial eligibility
tests are applied and contributions may be payable by the assisted person.

4. Civil Legal Aid

Civil Legal Aid provides legal representation in civil court proceedings,
primarily in the County Court and in the High Court. Civil Legal Aid allows a
person to obtain legal representation by a solicitor and a barrister(s), either
to bring or to defend a court case. Civil Legal Aid is granted by the Northern
Ireland Legal Services Commission. This scheme has a financial eligibility test
and contributions may be payable by the assisted person.

5. Criminal Legal Aid

Criminal Legal Aid provides free legal representation to an accused person
facing criminal proceedings, primarily in the magistrates' court and the Crown
Court. (Criminal Legal Aid is also available for appeals to the County Court and
the Court of Appeal following conviction in the magistrates' court and Crown
Court, respectively.) To obtain free Criminal Legal Aid, the accused is required
to meet two tests, namely that it is in the interests of justice that free legal
aid should be granted and that the accused has insufficient means to pay for his
own legal aid. Criminal Legal Aid is granted by the judiciary and no financial
contribution is required from any person granted Criminal Legal Aid.

Other

For persons and proceedings not covered by the five types of legal aid set out
above, there is a statutory exceptional grant legal aid scheme. This scheme has
been used to fund representation for relatives of the deceased at inquest
hearings.

Recession, broken promises posing health disaster: AIDS experts;
Canadian researcher blasts rich nations for their 'criminal' silence on failing
to deliver medicine as politically charged conference begins

BYLINE: GEOFFREY YORK

SECTION: INTERNATIONAL NEWS; INTERNATIONAL AIDS CONFERENCE; Pg. A1

LENGTH: 835 words

DATELINE: CAPE TOWN, SOUTH AFRICA


At one of their most politically charged conferences ever, AIDS scientists are
warning of a looming health catastrophe because of the global recession and the
"criminal" silence of world leaders on their faltering HIV-AIDS promises.

Thousands of people are dying unnecessarily of AIDS every day because of a
growing gap between what science demands and what politicians deliver, Canadian
scientist Julio Montaner told the conference.

Even as wealthy countries are providing full access to AIDS medicine for their
own citizens, up to 12 million people in poorer countries are unable to get the
life-saving medicine they desperately need, Dr. Montaner told the International
AIDS Society last night.

Dr. Montaner, the society's president, is director of the B.C. Centre for
Excellence in HIV/AIDS. He and his fellow organizers, who have mounted one of
the most political conferences the AIDS society has ever held, are furious that
the G8 ignored the HIV-AIDS issue at its annual summit this month. The G8
leaders made no mention of the issue in their final communiqué - just four years
after pledging at the 2005 Gleneagles summit to fight for universal access to
AIDS treatment by 2010.

"The silence of the G8 leaders is not just pathetic, it is criminal," Dr.
Montaner told a news conference at the opening of the AIDS-society conference,
which is convened every two years and is being held this year in Cape Town.

"We will not shut up on this issue," he said. "It will be a dominant issue this
week [at the conference]. We will not be silent."

Because of the global economic slump, some of the biggest donors to HIV-AIDS
treatment programs are seeing their budgets slashed, while others fear for their
very survival, he said.

The global recession "represents an immediate threat to the progress we have
witnessed over the last decade," he said.

"A retrenchment now would be catastrophic. ... We know what needs to be done,
yet implementation flounders, costing thousands of lives each day."

Cutting back on HIV-AIDS treatment programs during the recession will mean
billions or even trillions of dollars in additional costs over the long term,
especially because of growing scientific evidence that anti-retroviral medicine
for AIDS patients can be crucial in preventing the transmission of the AIDS
virus, Dr. Montaner said.

His scathing criticism of world leaders was echoed by other scientists at the
conference.

Françoise Barré-Sinoussi, a French scientist who played a key role in
identifying the AIDS virus in 1983 and later won the Nobel Prize for medicine,
said the world is facing a health disaster if governments abandon their pledge
to fight for universal access to AIDS treatment.

"Governing bodies and world leaders will be responsible for this disaster if
they don't uphold their commitments," she told the conference. "HIV is not in
recession."

In another highly political gesture, the conference gave a prominent keynote
position to Canadian AIDS campaigner Stephen Lewis, co-director of AIDS Free
World and a former United Nations special envoy on HIV-AIDS in Africa.

Though not a scientist himself, Mr. Lewis was invited to tell the conference how
scientists can be activists. His speech last night was a blistering assault on
politicians who find excuses to cut AIDS funding, and a plea to scientists to
get involved in the political struggle.

"When the G8 won't renew its 2005 commitment to universal access, when the G8
cynically uses the financial crisis to threaten cutbacks to AIDS funding ...
then it's time for science to speak with one powerful voice of accusation," Mr.
Lewis said.

"You spend every day of your working lives to make life possible, and the power
brokers devalue your work with the fraudulent plea of destitution," he told the
scientists. "Don't let them get away with it."

In an interview, Mr. Lewis said the politicization of AIDS scientists is a sign
of the times. "I think they're feeling very anxious about the circumstances
today," he said. "Things have started to slip away. To lose that momentum now
would be a disaster."

In another symbol of the new mood of political activism, Dr. Montaner and other
conference organizers joined hundreds of AIDS activists in a street rally in
downtown Cape Town last night just before the conference opened. The activists
cheered when Dr. Montaner denounced the G8 leaders as "delinquent" in their
promises.

Meanwhile, the independent group, Doctors Without Borders, warned that
disruptions in the supply of AIDS medicine are threatening the lives of HIV
patients in at least six African countries.

"Funding gaps and supply-management problems have led to the delay, suspension
or risk of suspension of the supply of life-saving HIV drugs," said the group,
also known as Médecins sans frontières.

Waiting lists for AIDS medicine are growing longer every day in South Africa,
while the supply of the medicine in several regions of Malawi and other
countries is running dangerously low, the group said.

Join the fight to raise awareness

SECTION: FEATURES; Pg. 51

LENGTH: 367  words


MORE than 190 countries around the world participate in events to commemorate
World AIDS Day on December 1 each year.

This year is the event's 19th anniversary.

In Australia, World AIDS Day is the culmination of AIDS Awareness Week, which
starts on November 24.

AIDS Awareness Week aims to raise community awareness and education about HIV
(Human Immunodeficiency Virus) and AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome) and
to show support to people living with HIV/AIDS.

Not all people who are infected with HIV will develop AIDS.

During the past 10 years major improvements have occurred in HIV treatments,
especially in Australia.

But sufferers are not so fortunate overseas and HIV can lead to AIDS.

The theme of this year's World AIDS Day campaign is ''HIV/AIDS: prevention is
everybody's business''.

This theme reminds people that HIV/AIDS remains a serious issue, there is still
no known cure, and awareness and prevention remain our best defences against its
spread.

HIV is a health issue that affects the entire community and therefore prevention
is everybody's responsibility.

The World AIDS Day campaign also aims to inform people about the important of
care and support services that are available for people affected by HIV, and to
reduce stigma and discrimination.

The red ribbon has been the international symbol of HIV and AIDS awareness for
15 years.

All money raised from the sale of ribbons goes towards support services for
people living with HIV/AIDS.

Red ribbons will be available for a gold coin donation during AIDS Awareness
Week.

Ribbons are available from a range of locations, including the Northern
Territory AIDS and Hepatitis Council, located at 46 Woods St, Darwin.

There will be two events held in Darwin during AIDS Awareness Week.

A community stall will operate at Casuarina Shopping Centre on Wednesday,
November 28 and Thursday, November 29 from 10am-3pm.

A World AIDS Day breakfast, to commemorate World AIDS Day, will be hosted by the
Northern Territory AIDS and Hepatitis Council (NTAHC).

It will be held at Cornucopia Museum Cafe on Friday, November 30 at 7.30am.

Tickets cost $25 per person and are available from NTAHC.

Answers to wrong questions on AIDS

Answers to wrong questions on AIDS

EACH year on December 1, the AIDS advocacy industry uses World AIDS Day to
rehearse familiar themes, while the number of victims rises steadily. This year
the tag line is, "Stop AIDS. Keep the promise", an exhortation for more aid.

The idea that AIDS in Africa and other poor countries can be reversed only with
large sums of aid money is certainly politically attractive. After all, only
someone with a complete disregard for humanity could argue against it. But this
tin-rattling is not providing answers to the AIDS problem. Instead, this year's
World AIDS day should be looking at some more effective approaches.

First, we must examine exactly what World AIDS day is asking us to support. Top
of the list is further funding for the World Health Organisation's flagship "3
by 5" programme, which had hoped to get 3-million people onto life-prolonging
antiretroviral treatment by the end of this year. With one month to go, this
target will be missed spectacularly.

The "3 by 5" programme is an example of a top-down programme that has failed
because its strategy was hijacked by the AIDS activist lobby. This lobby has for
years chanted "treatment for all". But dilapidated African health systems are
simply unable to distribute the medicines to all those in need, let alone
monitor treatment.

A more considered strategy would have recognised this and emphasised prevention.
As a result, the total number of people living with AIDS has actually increased
since the programme started. This year saw the highest number of new infections
since records began.

It is time to tackle the real reasons AIDS is flourishing. AIDS is so tenacious
not because of the cost of medicines or a lack of aid. The reason AIDS has taken
such a hold in Africa and parts of Asia is because these regions suffer from
stifling political and economic oppression.

Leading public health experts are unanimous that prevention is of paramount
importance to combat AIDS. But political oppression has made it difficult to
spread that message.

Economic oppression is an even more fundamental vector of this disease. When
governments restrict the ability of people to exchange goods freely under the
rule of law, poverty and hopelessness are guaranteed. People flee from the
countryside looking for work, to be greeted with urban slums and unemployment.
Poverty leads desperate parents to sell their children into the sex trade. For
poor women with few employment opportunities, prostitution is one of the few
options available. Drug abuse is rife. In the poverty of the favelas in Brazil
and the shantytowns of Africa and India, HIV finds fertile ground.

But this urban squalor need not exist if people had real employment
opportunities and the ability to create wealth for themselves. Unfortunately,
governments that restrict economic liberty make this impossible.

At the moment, the west is coming up with the wrong answers about AIDS. Money
for AIDS projects can make things worse. Instead of salving its conscience by
pouring aid money into Africa, the west could do something of far greater value
by undermining the ability of political cliques to oppress their people.

Western governments should therefore be encouraging countries to institute
property rights and foster respect for the rule of law. This is the only way the
benefits of economic growth will reach the poor and allow them to escape the
conditions that spread AIDS.

The AIDS lobby for too long has been giving us the wrong answers to the wrong
questions. Freedom has brought prosperity to the west and ensured it has
remained insulated from the worst of the AIDS crisis. Let's hear more voices in
2006 calling for this freedom to be extended to where it is most needed.

Network, September 2005) and director of the Campaign for Fighting Diseases.

U.S. aid delivered to fight AIDS;
The $350 million to help Africa and the Caribbean
is the first installment of $15 billion Bush pledged.

BYLINE: Sumana Chatterjee INQUIRER WASHINGTON BUREAU

SECTION: NATIONAL; Pg. A08

LENGTH: 529 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON


The United States yesterday gave $350 million for programs to fight HIV and AIDS
in 12 African and two Caribbean nations.

The funding is the first chunk of the $15 billion that President Bush promised
to spend over five years to fight the disease.

The aid will help some of the hardest-hit countries provide anti-retroviral
drugs that can prolong the lives of people suffering from AIDS. The aid also
will help provide safe blood programs, care for children affected by AIDS, and
youth prevention programs that emphasize the so-called ABC approach -
abstinence, being faithful to one's partner, and the use of condoms.

That prevention-based approach is the U.S. government's primary strategy,
according to a report on the five-year U.S. plan to fight AIDS. That report also
was released yesterday.

Critics have argued the approach is not culturally sensitive to the communities
most ravaged by AIDS. They also have said that the administration was supporting
programs that duplicate work by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, an independent
group set up in 2002 and financed by countries and private organizations.

The United States contributes to the fund, but the Bush administration wants to
reduce that contribution and focus U.S. money on programs administered by the
federal government.

'Hardly moving fast'

For fiscal 2004, Congress appropriated $547 million to the Global Fund. The Bush
administration wants to cut the amount to $200 million for fiscal 2005.

"The U.S. is bypassing this very effective program that is already up and
running," said Paul Zeitz, director of the Global AIDS Alliance, a nonprofit
coalition based in Washington.

Zeitz said Bush proposed increasing AIDS funding 13 months ago but was only now
releasing the first funds. "He has $2.4 billion to spend this year on AIDS.
Releasing $350 million now is hardly moving fast," he said.

But administration officials said it was the first step toward a goal of
treating two million people with anti-retroviral therapy, preventing seven
million new infections, and caring for 10 million people infected with the virus
or whose close family members suffer from the disease.

'Commitment'

"The President is providing unprecedented leadership and commitment of resources
to fight the pandemic of AIDS in the world's most afflicted countries," White
House spokesman Scott McClellan said.

Sen. Mike DeWine (R., Ohio), a chief advocate of AIDS funding, praised the
administration "for cutting through the bureaucracy and moving quickly to
distribute funding to countries and programs. This is exactly the kind of action
and leadership that is needed if we are to win the war against HIV/AIDS."

AIDS is a viral disease caused by HIV that weakens the immune system. In 2003,
an estimated 34 million people worldwide had HIV/AIDS. In sub-Saharan Africa,
26.6 million people were living with HIV, and 3.2 million developed AIDS. During
the same year, 2.3 million people in that region died of AIDS. Only 50,000
people in the region were taking anti-retroviral drugs.

Premier Wen Jiabao December 1 visited AIDS patients at Ditan Hospital in
Beijing, signaling a new openness by the Chinese government on the deadly
disease. The visit, which was shown on state television, was timed to coincide
with World AIDS Day. [See 2002 China: Detained AIDS Activist Freed; Other
Development]

Wen shook hands with AIDS patients, and offered them words of comfort. The
premier later told reporters that his government would make AIDS awareness,
prevention and treatment a high priority. He was the first Chinese leader to
address the AIDS epidemic in public.

According to a United Nations estimate reported November 10, as many as 1.5
million Chinese were infected with HIV, the virus that caused AIDS. The U.N.
believed that, at the current infection rate, up to 20 million Chinese could be
HIV-positive by 2010.

Other News

 In other news about AIDS in China:

     ·     China November 10 hosted an international AIDS conference at
          Beijing's Qinghua University. One of the featured speakers, former
          U.S. President Bill Clinton, called the high cost of AIDS drugs as "an
          international scandal."
     ·     Health Minister Gao Qiang November 6 disclosed that the government
          had begun to provide free anti-retroviral drugs to HIV carriers and
          AIDS patients in rural areas in central China. According to Gao, the
          number of Chinese who had tested positive for AIDS was 80,000.
          (Chinese researchers November 10 revealed that one in every five
          people who had received the free drugs had discontinued using them
          within the first seven months of the program, prompting fear of an
          emergence of drug-resistant strains of HIV.)
     ·     A foreign ministry spokesman September 4 defended China's record on
          fighting AIDS. The statement came in response to a September 3 report
          by Human Rights Watch. The report asserted that discriminatory laws
          and restrictions on freedom of expression had exacerbated the AIDS
          problem in China.
     ·     The health ministry was seeking to double its annual AIDS budget from
          the current $12.5 million, it was reported August 4.



Henan Health Official Arrested

 A provincial health official had been arrested for leaking a classified
document that appeared to indicate a cover-up of the AIDS crisis in rural Henan
province, it was reported October 7.

Henan, in central China, had a very high concentration of people with HIV and
AIDS. The epidemic had been spurred in the early 1990s, when provincial
officials encouraged poor farmers to sell their own blood plasma. Dealers in
plasma had allowed HIV-tainted blood to be pooled with healthy blood. [See 2001
China: AIDS Honoree Barred From Exiting China]

The defendant, Ma Shiwen, was the deputy director for disease control in Henan.
He had been arrested in August for allegedly distributing to Chinese AIDS
activists, including Wan Yanhai, a government document showing that Henan
officials had chosen to conceal their knowledge of the region's growing AIDS
problem. Wan had been arrested in 2002 for possessing the document. [See 2002
China: Detained AIDS Activist Freed; Other Development]

According to Chinese sources cited by the New York Times, Liu Quanxi, an
influential Henan legislator who was a former director of the province's health
department, had lobbied for Ma's arrest.

Henan had become a center of AIDS-related controversies. According to the
Beijing AIDS Action Project, an activist group, police had indiscriminately beat
people in the village of Xiongqiao on the night of June 21-22, one day after a
delegation of Xiongqiao's AIDS suffers had staged a public protest in Henan's
capital, Zhengzhou, over inadequate medical care.

In another development, Li Demin, a Henan promoter of "natural" AIDS remedies,
had filed suit against Dr. Gao Yaojie, a renowned AIDS activist, it was reported
August 25. Li claimed to have been slandered by Gao's insistence in a newsletter
that his remedies were bogus. He filed his suit in Zhengzhou. [See 2001 China:

EAST BAY COMMUNITIES HONOR VICTIMS ON WORLD AIDS DAY;
* PUBLIC CEREMONIES, PRIVATE REMINISCENCES ARE FORUMS AND MEMORIALS FOR LIVES
SHORTENED, CHANGED BY DISEASE

Sheltered by umbrellas, holding candles, they streamed across college campuses
and drizzly downtown streets Monday night.

They signed World AIDS Day petitions, spoke out on East Bay stages and listened
solemnly to the lists of names - the community members, artists and friends who
died from AIDS.

World AIDS Day commemorations offered solemn memorials, education efforts and
joyful celebrations in cities from Hong Kong to Walnut Creek, Concord, Moraga,
Pleasanton and Richmond.

Alameda and Contra Costa counties have the dubious distinction of being among
California's top 10 counties in AIDS cases.

The good news is that both the diagnosis and fatality rates have been steadily
declining across the state. What was a death sentence in 1987, now kills 59
percent of its sufferers.

World AIDS Day observances commemorate those lives and remind the public that
despite medical advances, AIDS continues around the world.

In Walnut Creek, the Genard AIDS Foundation and the Lesher Regional Center for
the Arts teamed up for the fifth annual Candlelight AIDS March through downtown.
Marchers made their way, damply, from the Liberty Bell in Broadway Plaza to the
Regional Center, then slowly lined the theater's curving staircase to listen as
names were read.

For the DeJarlais family, longtime members of PFLAG, or Parents, Families and
Friends of Lesbians and Gays, this is a tradition. Nan DeJarlais and her
husband, Fred, have done this from the beginning.

"It's very short, very simple and quiet," said Nan DeJarlais, noting that in the
time it took to walk those few blocks, another 100 AIDS sufferers had died
worldwide. "AIDS has touched me deeply. It's probably touched a lot of people
more than they know."

Diablo Valley College students spent the day learning about the global epidemic
from guest lecturers and viewing panels from the AIDS Memorial Quilt, the
largest ongoing community arts project in the world. Free HIV testing was also
offered.

In Pleasanton, the Valley Community Health Center held a candlelight vigil and
march through downtown.

The West County AIDS Task Force and Contra Costa Public Health Services marked
the annual observance with a candlelight vigil and ceremony at the Nevin
Community Center in Richmond. Blankets, toothbrushes and toothpaste were
distributed to those in need.

The task force was formed in 1999 in response to the high numbers of AIDS cases
in West County.

In Moraga, St. Mary's College students covered campus artwork in white draperies
in recognition of the especially hard hit the arts community endured in the AIDS
epidemic's early days. Some 8,000 art galleries and museums worldwide shutter
their doors and cover their artwork in mourning for "A Day Without Art," a
14-year-old tradition aligned with World Aids Day.

"It is a day to bring messages of compassion, hope, solidarity, awareness and
understanding to every country in the world," said Miriam Eisenhardt, the
college's health and wellness educator and coordinator for the day's events.

Students discussed a semester's worth of AIDS research projects that looked at
the deadly disease's impact on youth and hip-hop culture, as well as
relationships between AIDS and gender and race issues.

The evening hours were spent first in quiet, candlelit contemplation, and then
jubilant celebration with student dance performances, poetry readings and the
art of African-American gay rapper Tim'm West.

Scientists reject AIDS sceptics

BYLINE: Matthew Hart

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 10

LENGTH: 385 words


A COLLABORATION of international scientists has slammed suggestions by renegade
researchers that HIV is not the cause of AIDS.

More than 5000 scientists from more than 50 countries have released a joint
statement, called the Durban Declaration, urging an immediate end to the debate,
noting that the continued denial of the cause of AIDS "will cost countless
lives".

Among the signatories to the Durban Declaration are 11 Nobel laureates, the
directors of leading research institutes and international medical societies.

The declaration follows recent comments by South African President Thabo Mbeki,
who expressed doubt that HIV caused AIDS.

Other dissident researchers, such as American virologist Peter Duesberg, have
claimed that AIDS is caused by lifestyle choices, such as poor nutrition,
homosexuality and recreational drugs.

He also suggested that some anti-AIDS medications caused the disease.

American AIDS specialist Dr Charles van der Horst, who devised the declaration
with several colleagues, said false statements about the cause of AIDS were
doing an incredible disservice to the world community.

"By promulgating the fiction that HIV is not the cause of AIDS, prevention
efforts are thrown out the window, and, I believe, it is like committing
genocide," he said.

The Durban Declaration affirms that the scientific evidence supporting the link
between HIV and

AIDS is "clear cut, exhaustive and unambiguous".

The declaration points to research which shows that: patients with AIDS are
always infected with HIV; most people with HIV infections show signs of AIDS in
five to 10 years unless treated; people who receive HIV-contaminated blood
develop AIDS; and most children who develop AIDS are born to HIV-infected
mothers.

AIDS Society of India president Dr N.M. Samuel said the knowledge that HIV
caused AIDS was the most potent weapon the world had against the disease.

"If we can prevent the transmission of HIV we can stop the spread of AIDS," he
said.

An estimated 34 million people worldwide live with HIV or AIDS, most in
sub-Saharan Africa.

Last year, 2.8 million people died of AIDS, the highest rate since the start of
the epidemic.

The declaration's release comes ahead of the opening of the International AIDS
Conference in Durban, South Africa on Sunday.

CHANGING FACE OF AIDS SEEN IN SOUTH; FROM 1986 TO 1996, CASES INCREASED MOST
RAPIDLY AMONG HETEROSEXUALS.

WASHINGTON -- When the AIDS storm hit in the 1980s, Davis Hawkins knew almost
immediately what his fate would be as a gay male whose partner was an
intravenous drug user.

"I could see it coming; the handwriting was on the wall," said Hawkins, a
Charlotte, N.C., man who was diagnosed with the AIDS virus in 1988 and
contracted the disease five years later.

What the former Texan didn't know until after he became a volunteer AIDS
educator is that other groups are increasingly more at risk for contracting the
AIDS virus.

While there are more AIDS cases among men who have sex with men, many new HIV
infections are occurring among women, African Americans and people infected
heterosexually, according to data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention.

Between 1986 and 1996, AIDS cases increased most rapidly among heterosexuals,
with the most dramatic increases in the South, according to a recent survey by
the Atlanta-based CDC.

The CDC found that 34 percent of all AIDS cases reported through 1997 were in
Southern states -- the largest proportion for AIDS cases by region. The figure
is even higher for the rural South, which had 54 percent of the 58,680 cases
found in rural areas nationally.

"It is steadily increasing in the rural areas," said Sharon Jordan-Shaver,
director of HIV and AIDS prevention development programs at the Alabama Public
Health Department.

In Alabama, for example, 37.4 percent of AIDS and HIV victims live outside the
state's most populous areas in mostly agricultural regions.

Medical authorities blame the rise on lack of knowledge about who is at risk
from AIDS, crack cocaine use, alcohol abuse and a generally high rate of
sexually transmitted disease.

AIDS experts continue to advocate early testing and improved access to care as
ways to stop the spread of infection.

But some controversial prevention measures that experts say are effective, such
as clean-needle exchange programs and school-sponsored condom programs, have
been blocked in many states.

Tuesday's World AIDS Day theme reflected the shifts in the epidemic with a focus
on youth, who make up at least half of new HIV cases worldwide, according to
campaign sponsors.

"The face of AIDS is anybody's face," said Evelyn Foust, chief of HIV-STD
Prevention and Care at the North Carolina Department of Health and Human
Services. "AIDS does not discriminate on the basis of age, sex or race."

But the disease clearly is disproportionately affecting certain groups. In North
Carolina, AIDS is the leading cause of death for African Americans between the
ages of 15 and 44, Foust said.

President Clinton on Tuesday extolled the progress of AIDS education at a World
AIDS Day event. "It's all right to celebrate our progress, but we cannot rest
until we have actually put a stop to AIDS," he said.

He announced $ 200 million in research funding to develop an AIDS vaccine and
other money to provide housing for U.S. AIDS victims.

PRAYERS FOR AIDS VICTIMS

It was a day for reflection, prayer and hope as the Bronx commemorated World
AIDS Day 1995.

The AIDS epidemic has claimed nearly 10,000 lives in the borough with many more
infected. According to the latest available health figures, 14,134 Bronx
residents have been diagnosed with full-blown AIDS 1,468 last year alone.

The startling toll was on the minds of many Friday as hundreds of Bronx
residents and public officials commemorated the international day of action and
AIDS advocacy.

"Today we remember both the immeasurable losses we have shared and the victories
large and small," Bronx Borough Fernando Ferrer told a gathering of AIDS
activists and community and religious leaders during an AIDS awareness rally at
the Bronx County Building.

"We cannot turn away. Anyone who has seen the impact of AIDS must recommit
themself to fighting or [AIDS] education and services."

Thursday evening, Ferrer presented leading AIDS advocates with copies of a new
publication, the Bronx Directory of AIDS Services, a 60-page AIDS resource
booklet listing local outreach organizations for people with AIDS.

On Friday, the Bronx Health Center, at 1967 Turnbull Ave., held several events
throughout the day, including a reception to learn about AIDS and HIV, a play
written by staff members on the AIDS issue and free HIV testing and counseling.

Health Force: Women and Men Against AIDS, a Bronx-based project affiliate with
Bronx Community College, sponsored a conference on the future of families in the
era of AIDS at the CUNY Graduate Center in Manhattan.

It was followed by an afternoon rally in Bryant Park to remember AIDS-affected
families.

Montefiore Medical Center held a hope and remembrance session in its main
auditorium. AIDS quilts were also displayed in the hospital's lobby.

The Urban Health Plan, a community-based health services clinic, held an evening
candlelight vigil in Benjamin Gladstone Square Park near Westchester Ave. and
West Farms Road.

Yesterday, the Fordham Evangelical Lutheran Church on Walton Ave. held an
afternoon service for prayer and healing for HIV and AIDS.

NATIONAL AIDS COMMISSION LAMBASTES BUSH, CONGRESS

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 17A

LENGTH: 655 words


WASHINGTON - The National Commission on AIDS warned Wednesday that a growing
indifference to the AIDS epidemic and what it said was a continued lack of
leadership by Congress and the White House were making a bad situation worse.
In its first comprehensive report, the 2-year-old commission offered more than
two dozen recommendations. At the top of the list is development of a national
AIDS plan to identify priorities and resources needed to fight AIDS (acquired
immune deficiency syndrome).  The commission said that the virus was reaping a
grim harvest of death and that the country wasn't doing enough to stop it.
During the last 10 years, 1 million Americans have been infected by the HIV
virus, 180,000 have been diagnosed as having AIDS and 118,000 of those have
died. The commission predicted that the AIDS death toll would reach 350, 000 by
the end of 1993.  The commission's sharpest criticism was directed at President
George Bush and Congress. They were accused of not organizing a wide-ranging
AIDS research and treatment program involving all Americans.  Bush was singled
out by Dr. David Rogers, the commission's vice chairman and medical director of
Johns Hopkins University Hospital in Baltimore.  Rogers said Bush had failed to
rouse the country for an all-out attack on the disease. On several occasions,
Bush has said he's sympathetic to AIDS victims, but that isn't good enough,
Rogers said.  ''AIDS is the domestic crisis of our time,'' Rogers said. ''The
president should indicate we have a steadily mounting crisis on our hands and we
need to roll up our sleeves and hit it.'' In response, White House Press
Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the administration agreed that AIDS is a major
health problem. He pointed out that the federal government would spend $4
billion on AIDS during the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. Fitzwater also said
the government had spent $17 billion on the disease in recent years.  The
commission's report chided Congress for approving several AIDS programs but for
failing to finance them adequately.  The report urges Bush to appoint a
Cabinet-level group and to order it to organize a national AIDS plan. The plan
would coordinate federal, state and local governments' AIDS programs. The
program would also coordinate the work of health practitioners, hospitals,
clinics, nursing homes and hospices, research institutions, volunteers, and all
organizations providing AIDS care, information and education.  Ideally, the
national AIDS program should be financed by a national healt h insurance plan,
the report says, but there's little likelihood that the White House and Congress
will enact such a program soon.  As an alternative, the commission recommended
establishing a program that would give AIDS patients a comprehensive package of
benefits. Included would be physician's care and medical treatments in a
hospital, nursing home, hospice or at home; drug treatments; psychological
counseling; and social services.  This package could be paid for by liberalizing
Medicaid, the state-operated program that now provides health care for the poor
and disabled, the report says.  To further help AIDS victims, the commission
recommended the establishment of a federal program to buy and distribute anti-
AIDS drugs. Further, the commission recommended faster approval of experimental
AIDS drugs by the Food and Drug Administration and price controls for drugs that
are found to be effective.  Commission members were appointed by Congress and
the White House to advise national leaders on AIDS policy.  The panel
specifically rejected the idea of mandatory testing for medical personnel, a key
issue of some groups that contend Americans are unknowingly exposed to the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) by doctors, dentists, nurses and others with the
infection.  Such requirements would divert resources from areas where they are
needed more, the panel said.

Footing the Bill;
The Politics Behind the Money

SECTION: HEALTH; PAGE Z9; AFTER 10 YEARS

LENGTH: 1442 words


AIDS is calling the bluff of the health care system.

Increasingly the disease, which has struck more than 136,000 Americans, is
highlighting the yawning gaps in medical care for the poor, the chronically ill
and the millions of Americans who have only partial health insurance or none at
all.

In the process, a kind of medical moralism has provided a backdrop for
high-stakes budget decisions, heightening disparities between the so-called
"innocent victims" (mostly children) and intravenous drug users and gay men, who
are seen by some as having caused their illness by their behavior.

In the competition for AIDS funding, children, who comprise 2 percent of
reported AIDS cases, got nearly half -- $ 14.8 million out of $ 32 million -- of
federal funds appropriated in 1990 for pilot community-based AIDS programs.

At the same time, tens of thousands of inner-city intravenous drug users, often
the parents of these children who are also sick with AIDS, threaten to swamp
already overwhelmed public hospitals in a dozen or so cities, including New York
and Washington.

Public health experts say that AIDS has speeded the creation of a medical
underclass among people who are already beset by the problems of homelessness,
drug and alcohol addiction and inadequate education.

"AIDS is a metaphor for what's wrong with this country," said June E. Osborn,
chairwoman of the National Commission on AIDS. "We're moving quickly to an
underclass epidemic. We either have to stare at the underclass and say, 'We
don't care,' or we . . . have to do something to change the way health care is
administered."

Osborn, dean of the School of Public Health at the University of Michigan, is
echoing the conclusions of the chairman of a previous presidential AIDS
commission. Two years ago, retired admiral James D. Watkins, now Energy
Secretary, decried the federal government's "slow, halting and uneven response"
to AIDS, a situation that he said underscored the shaky condition of the health
care system.

In New York City, which has been hit hardest by the AIDS epidemic, the problems
are especially glaring. "It's like a slowly unfolding national disaster, and
people are just now starting to notice," said Timothy Sweeney, an official of
the Gay Men's Health Crisis, the nation's oldest and largest AIDS service
organization, based in Manhattan. "The AIDS epidemic, [along] with crack and the
increasing ranks of the homeless, is overloading emergency rooms. And it's
putting us all at risk." The Politics of Funding

Last week, the House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed an AIDS "disaster
relief" bill that authorizes $ 4 billion to be spent over the next five years
for outpatient care and community-based programs. The Senate approved a similar
bill last month, and the final measure will be hammered out in a conference
committee.

Half of the money is to be earmarked for 16 cities, including the District,
which have been hit hardest by AIDS. The other half is to be divided among all
50 states; those with more AIDS cases would get more money.

Another measure sponsored by Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Calif.) would extend
Medicaid coverage for outpatient care and would pay for expensive drugs, such as
AZT, for low-income people who are infected with the AIDS virus but have not yet
developed the disease. Its aim is to delay the onset of AIDS and to try to
prevent unnecessary and expensive hospitalization.

Medicaid, the federal-state program for the poor, is the major source of funding
for the care of AIDS patients. But its stringent rules exclude as many as
200,000 who are infected with HIV, according to congressional staff estimates.

"You clearly have a lot of messages being delivered through these bills," said
Jean McGuire, executive director of the Washington-based AIDS Action Council, a
coalition of community-based AIDS groups that supports the bills. "One is that
we've hit a certain critical mass where now everybody knows somebody who has the
disease. Another is that we have a flawed [health care] system that is at the
root of the problem."

Even so, the fate of the disaster relief bill is uncertain. The Bush
administration opposes what it calls "narrow, disease-specific" legislation.
Such an approach "sets a dangerous precedent," the White House said in a
prepared statement last week.

"Why do it for AIDS and not some other disease?" asked Gail Wilensky,
administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration, which manages
Medicaid. "The administration is looking at the tougher issue, which is what to
do with the uninsured. To the extent that some of the uninsured are persons with
AIDS, we will be addressing that." Who Gets the Dollars

Federal spending has steadily increased since 1982, when $ 8 million was
allotted for AIDS. This year, the federal government will spend $ 2.9 billion on
research, care and public health programs, of which $ 780 million is Medicaid
and Medicare funds.

Despite the size of the AIDS budget, federal spending on AIDS is a tiny portion
-- about 1 percent -- of the approximately $ 160 billion the government spends
on health.

From the beginning, federal funding favored basic research into the AIDS virus,
an enterprise that has enhanced the understanding of other diseases, including
cancer, multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis.

The Public Health Service's Agency for Health Care Policy and Research has
estimated that in 1989 about 40 percent of the cost of medical care for AIDS
patients was borne by Medicaid and Medicare, another 40 percent was covered by
private insurers and 20 percent was paid by individuals or absorbed by
hospitals. The cost of caring for people diagnosed with AIDS in 1989 was
estimated to be $ 3.3 billion.  Health officials project that 87,000 more people
will contract AIDS in 1992 and the cost will double to $ 6.5 billion.

Part of the problem of determining precisely who pays for AIDS -- which is
estimated to cost between $ 53,500 and $ 100,580 per case -- is that Medicaid
programs vary from state to state and insurance companies do not routinely
categorize claims by diseases. In addition, people with AIDS often pay expenses
out of their own pockets, fearing discrimination by insurance companies and
employers.

In order to better estimate current and future costs, the federal government
this fall will launch a study that will review the health expenditures for 2,000
AIDS patients.

Economists say the biggest increase in cost this year is likely to come from
wider use of preventive drugs. AZT, the chief AIDS drug, costs $ 3,000 to $
9,000 annually, depending on the frequency with which it is taken. Last March,
the Food and Drug Administration announced it would recommend that AZT be
prescribed as a preventive measure for those infected with HIV, not just to
treat people who already have AIDS.

It is estimated that 600,000 of the approximately 1 million people infected with
HIV could qualify for the drug under the new labeling. If they all seek AZT,
analysts say the bill could reach $ 1.62 billion a year.

"AIDS has shown us that we can produce medical miracles for the rich and plain
neglect for the poor," said Waxman.  Greater Burden on States

Increasingly, the responsibility of paying for AIDS is shifting from the federal
government to revenue-strapped states. Those with the greatest numbers of AIDS
cases, such as New York and New Jersey, are struggling to find ways to pay.

State programs that cover the cost of AZT vary widely. The District will pay for
the drug for those who earn less than $ 29,900 a year. In Northern Virginia, the
annual income limit is $ 13,461; in Maryland, it is $ 26,100, and in Texas, it
is $ 11,000.

According to the GAO, many states need help in developing and coordinating
health services -- including outpatient care, nursing home care and housing --
for AIDS patients.

Nowhere does the state burden seem as great as in New York, where 28,000 cases
of AIDS have been reported so far and an additional 11,000 are expected by the
end of this year. The extent of HIV infection is far greater: the state health
department estimates between 150,000 and 250,000 are affected. In 1989, about $
785 million was spent on AIDS, about 40 percent of which came from state and
local sources; this year, the figure is expected to exceed $ 1 billion.

In New York state, "we are taking care of 14,000 who have HIV infection," said
Sweeney. If an early intervention program were started, it is estimated that
120,000 others would qualify.

"The state is not coping now," he said. "It's certainly not going to be able to
cope with a much bigger caseload."

The demands of legal aid force change

BYLINE: Roger Smith

SECTION: Features

LENGTH: 817 words


Over the last 40 years, the existence of legal aid has affected the structure of
the profession remarkably little. Now, a number of developments not least,
financial pressure and the transfer of legal aid from the solicitors'
professional body, the Law Society, to a Government appointed Legal Aid Board
make major change unavoidable.

Lawyers' overall income from the Legal Aid Fund has risen dramatically over the
last 10 years, from Pounds 67 million in 197879 to Pounds 387 million a six-fold
increase, compared with a doubling of the retail prices index.

While City firms have increasingly modelled themselves on their corporate
clients, legal aid is still undertaken by widely dispersed practices of the
traditional high street kind.

Around three-quarters of all solicitors' offices still do some legal aid in the
year and payments go to as many as 11,500 solicitors' offices. Amounts, however,
are small most get less than Pounds 20,000 a year, indicating that legal aid is
not a substantial part of their income. A number of factors combine, however, to
link the future of legal aid with that of the profession as a whole. First,
although legal aid provides only about 11 per cent of the gross income of
solicitors overall, it is disproportionately important to provincial practices.
Payments from the legal aid fund amount to 4p in every Pounds 1 of the average
income of solicitors in London, but in, for instance, the north the proportion
rises to 20p.

Second, the high-street solicitors' monopoly on conveyancing income providing
them probably with still 40 per cent of their income before the recent
housemarket slump is now under threat, increasing the importance of other
sources of income.

Finally, there is a growing, though small, number of firms heavily dependent on
legal aid income 694 offices received more than a third of all the money paid
out in 198889.

Profit margins on legal aid are undoubtedly tight. The Legal Aid Board's
chairman, John Pitts, puts it in the category of ''high volume, low profit
work''. Any firm doing legal aid seriously must give meticulous attention to
systems to make it pay. Even then, the Law Society argues that criminal legal
aid work, in particular, is often unprofitable.

Legal aid work has become more stressful. Many criminal legal aid practitioners
take part in the national 24-hour hour duty solicitor scheme to give legal
advice to those held in police stations.

Although last year this brought solicitors an extra Pounds 26 million revenue,
pressures on the staff of small firms (two-thirds of all firms have fewer than
four partners) in providing night cover without sufficient time to recuperate
are beginning to tell.

Hopes that the Government will meet the Law Society's call for significantly
higher pay are unrealistic. A more likely solution lies in changes to
solicitors' organization. Firms must become large enough to afford to employ
specialist duty departments. Such a change is likely to be given impetus by the
Legal Aid Board, already talking about contracting out, ''franchising'' in its
jargon, not only the duty solicitor scheme but also civil legal aid to limited
numbers of larger firms. This could cut the numbers of offices doing civil legal
aid to some 2,000.

The problem in any rationalization of outlets is the clients' lack of mobility
due to poverty. They need local accessible services and increasingly specialist
provision. There are now about 60 law centres dealing with problems, such as
housing, traditionally ignored by legal aid practitioners.

Specialist services outside the legal aid scheme are also beginning to expand
with the birth of groups such as the Women's Legal Defence Fund and now the new
Public Law Project. Commercial forces, exaggerated by the intervention of the
Legal Aid Board, will thus lead to a major rationalization of legal aid
provision. The economies of the traditional mixed practice, now the backbone of
both the profession and legal aid provision, may well cease to become viable
once significant amounts of conveyancing income are lost. This is likely over
the next decade.

The result will be a further polarization in the profession between commercial
firms and legal aid practices. Legal aid will become the major, or sole, source
of funding for a discrete sector, giving the Legal Aid Board, and thereby the
government of the day, greater control over spending, types of provision,
quality of service and access.

This could lead to a sorely needed element of planning. But it also carries the
danger that legal aid lawyers will become seen as a poorer, second-class group
detached from the core of the profession.The challenge for the board is to mould
the restructuring of legal aid practice in a way that delivers high-quality
services by high-quality practitioners.

Top Executives Confused by AIDS Issue;
Poll Shows Firms Rank Disease Among Nation's Top Problems

BYLINE: Sally Squires, Washington Post Staff Writer

SECTION: FIRST SECTION; PAGE A1

LENGTH: 1045 words


Top-level business executives believe that AIDS is one of the most important
problems facing the nation today, but are often confused about their role in
dealing with employees who have the deadly disease, according to a new national
survey.

Results of the survey -- the first to poll the attitudes of high-echelon
American executives about AIDS -- show the misunderstanding and ambivalence that
grip business leaders over the growing epidemic and point to the need for
greater efforts within the business community to combat AIDS.

The executives said, for example, that employees should not be tested routinely
for the AIDS virus. If employees are tested, however, the executives believe
that the results should be shared with employers.

Some 623 randomly selected executives, 80 percent of them vice presidents or
higher, participated in the survey, which was cosponsored by Fortune magazine
and Allstate Insurance Co. Results of the survey were released yesterday at a
daylong conference on AIDS and the role of corporate America in dealing with the
epidemic.

The majority of executives polled felt that insurance companies -- not the
federal government -- should bear the brunt of the financial burden for AIDS
patients. About half of these executives believe that insurance premiums will
rise significantly because of AIDS-related health care costs.

"American business knows that it should be concerned about AIDS in the
workplace," said Herbert E. Lister, chairman of Allstate. "Yet it hasn't done
much about it."

Among the executives polled, AIDS ranked as the third most important problem
facing the nation today -- behind only the federal deficit and drug abuse.

Yet the survey found that few companies have taken steps to help those with the
disease or to educate their employees about preventing the spread of AIDS.

The majority of executives -- some 70 percent -- reported that their companies
"neither have nor are planning to develop any policy about AIDS," the survey
found. Only three of every 10 company executives surveyed report that their
companies have or are developing a policy for dealing with employees who
contract the deadly disease.

Only 10 percent of companies had some sort of written policy, while 8 percent
have an unwritten policy about AIDS. An additional 11 percent of executives
polled said that their companies are in the process of developing a policy on
AIDS.

As of Monday, 51,361 Americans have contracted AIDS, according to the federal
Centers for Disease Control, and 28,683 people in the United States have died of
the disease.

"The total treatment for life of a person with AIDS is estimated to cost about $
50,000," Otis R. Bowen, secretary of health and human services, told the
conference. Those costs will rise, Bowen said, "as we develop ways of keeping
people with the disease alive longer."

Exactly who will pay the rising health care costs of AIDS is still being
debated.

This year, about 40 percent of AIDS patients will have their care paid for by
federal and state funds through Medicaid at a cost of some $ 600 million. By
1992, those costs will soar to an estimated $ 2.5 billion.

But the majority of AIDS patients must turn to private charity, personal funds
or private health insurance to pay for their treatment. "And that's where you
come in," Bowen told participants at the conference.

If private companies have to take over the primary financial burden for AIDS
patients, most of those polled expect insurance costs to rise significantly.

"What this suggests is that insurance companies are going to have trouble with
their images down the road," said Merle Sprinzen, director of market research
for Fortune magazine.

The survey also found that:

High-level executives generally report that they have a fairly good
understanding about what AIDS is and how people contract the disease. Yet, when
it comes to dealing with employees who have AIDS, the survey also found that
many high-level executives misunderstand what steps they can take. Slightly more
than a quarter of the executives indicated that they would be very unsupportive.
Some in this group said that AIDS patients should be isolated from other
workers. Others indicated that AIDS patients are socially undesirable people and
that "they got what they deserved."

Almost half of the executives would give AIDS patients time off for treatment,
the survey found. About one-third of those polled said they would offer
counseling, and slightly more than a quarter would make some type of work
adjustment to allow people with AIDS to work as long as possible. But 16 percent
would try to get the employee to quit and 6 percent would fire a person with
AIDS. "Some of the actions the executives say their companies would take are, in
fact, illegal," Sprinzen said.

Half of the executives reported that their companies would face an image problem
if the public were to find out that someone in their company had AIDS.
Executives with smaller companies, those with less than 100 employees, believed
they would face the most difficulty if the public knew an employee had AIDS, and
executives with service-related companies said they faced a greater problem than
industrial businesses.

The majority of executives -- some 60 percent -- believe that employees should
not be tested for exposure to HIV -- the virus that causes AIDS.

But when employees are tested for exposure to the disease, the test results
should be shared with the employer, the executives said -- a policy that many
critics fear will result in discrimination against those who test positive for
the HIV virus.

"We need you to set the example for being fair and objective and for not
succumbing to groundless hysteria," Surgeon General C. Everett Koop told the
conference. "We need you to be informed about AIDS, to inform your employees
about AIDS and to encourage your employees to exercise appropriate preventive
measures."

As part of the conference, Allstate also released a 100-page report designed to
help companies deal with the current AIDS epidemic.

Called "AIDS: Corporate America Responds," the report was written in conjunction
with a consortium of companies and nonprofit organizations to help businesses
cope with the growing AIDS problem.

Agencies join forces against AIDS

   Metro agencies on the front lines of the AIDS crisis have found strength in
numbers by getting together to share information and pursue common goals.

"Just being able to meet, talk and vent our anger or frustration will help all
of us who are struggling with this terrible disease," says Laurie Edmiston,
manager of the Inner City Youth program, one of the groups involved.

Representatives of the agencies met last month for the first time at the urging
of Councillor Jack Layton, chairman of the Toronto Board of Health.

The AIDS planning group, as it is loosely called, is headed by the Canadian
Hemophilia Society and also includes the AIDS Committee Of Toronto, the AIDS
Drop-in Centre, the Addiction Research Foundation, the People With AIDS
Coalition and Casey House.

"The idea is for these groups to meet and to share common knowledge," says Santo
Caira, chief of support services for the hemophilia society. "We don't want to
have groups across the city reinventing the wheel."

While almost all organizations represented at the meeting have strong
reservations about forming an AIDS coalition or umbrella group in Metro, most
think regular brainstorming on the issue is important.

Information sharing among Metro groups dealing with the AIDS problem has been
sporadic and informal. For instance, if a woman tests positive for the AIDS
virus, she might want to talk to another woman who had been exposed to the
deadly disease. She might call the AIDS Committee Of Toronto for help, but the
committee may not have a women client in a similar situation who is willing to
talk. Down the street, however, at the AIDS Drop-in Centre, there might be such
a woman who is eager to share her experiences. Until now, only sheer luck would
have put the two women together.

"No one group can be all things to all people when we're talking about AIDS,"
says Caira, the planning group's co-ordinator. "We are all necessary and serve
an important segment of the community."

For example, hemophiliacs who have concerns about AIDS and blood products will
likely feel most comfortable seeking help and information from the hemophilia
society, Caira says.

But street kids who often don't read and don't trust adults will only be reached
by groups like Inner City Youth.

It's important that these groups get enough money to hire staff and supply
information to their particular community, Caira says.

The city's $11 million AIDS defence plan includes about $600,000 per year to
help community organizations reach their members.

Initially, there was some fear among established groups that new groups wanting
to get involved in the AIDS issue would compete for limited funding, admits Phil
Shaw, a spokesman for the AIDS Committee Of Toronto, which has been on the AIDS
scene for four years.

"But that feeling lasted for five seconds," he says. "And then we thought 'Oh
thank God, I'm glad somebody else is coming in on this.' "

While Layton admits more money may be needed to help these groups in the future,
he thinks it's important to define the need and then ask for money - not the
other way around.

In the meantime, organizations dealing with AIDS must define what they do, who
they serve and what they need, Layton says.

"Then we can begin to explore ways of filling in the cracks," he says.

Layton's role in the AIDS planning group will be to offer political advice.

World AIDS Day: Health officials preach testing, awareness

BYLINE: By Iris Hersh Staff writer

SECTION: LIFESTYLE

LENGTH: 888 words


Today is the 19th anniversary of World AIDS Day, and this year's theme is Stop
AIDS: Keep the Promise -- Accountability.

The theme is hoped to inspire and challenge people around the globe to hold
their political leaders accountable for the promises they have made regarding
AIDS, according to www.avert.org.

A world epidemic, great advances have been made in the treatment and knowledge
about HIV/AIDS. However, a cure has yet to be found.

Locally, Keystone Health Center in Chambersburg provides comprehensive related
services for families infected and affected by HIV/AIDS, including free,
confidential testing for the disease. The testing is painless and requires no
blood test.

"Anyone who has had unprotected sex should be tested," said Dr. David Hoffmann,
director of the HIV/AIDS program at Keystone Health Center, which is the only
AIDS provider between Franklin County and Pittsburgh. "Twenty-five percent of
those who are HIV positive don't know it."

The test is performed with an oral swab, it's quick and confidential results are
available in two days.

Great strides have been made in the detection, treatment and prognosis of the
disease.

"HIV was a death sentence 12 years ago, but now with new medications it's become
more of a chronic illness," Hoffmann said, adding he has patients who have had
HIV/AIDS for 20 years. "Much of the stigma associated with HIV/AIDS early on has
diminished."

In Pennsylvania, the AIDS Drugs Awareness Program has three programs, depending
on income, which help patients pay for their medications and other care
associated with the illness.

In addition to Hoffmann, who had extra training in HIV/AIDS, Dr. Paula Hamilton
and Dr. Steve Flack make up the HIV/AIDS treatment team at Keystone. The team
has treated 102 patients this year.

Half the HIV/AIDS patients treated at Keystone Health Center are intravenous
drug users who contracted the illness from sharing needles.

According to a booklet published by Keystone, patients of the HIV/AIDS primary
medical care program at Keystone are seen on an average of once every three to
four months. Patients are assessed at each medical appointment for compliance
with 28 medical care indicators that are the benchmark for HIV/AIDS treatment
nationally. Medical care indicators are tracked monthly for every HIV/AIDS
patient seen at the Keystone Health Center Family Practice.

Overall compliance for the entire 28 primary care indicators is 85 percent, and
98 percent of all clients are seen every three to four months in the medical
practice. Ninety-one percent of clients have a CD4 and viral load test completed
every three months.

From July 1 to Nov. 22, 383 free HIV tests have been performed for walk-ins and
patients referred by the medical staff.

Special funds are available for short term rent, mortgage or utility assistance
to present homelessness for HIV/AIDS patients. Emergency financial and
transportation services are also available. Funds are used for food vouchers,
mileage reimbursement for travel to medical appointments, drug/alcohol
outpatient treatment and child care for dependents while patients receive care.
Transportation funds may be used for gas vouchers. Counseling to ensure client
readiness to receive complex HIV/AIDS treatment is also available.

Outreach presentations, designed as preventative educational sessions, are aimed
at promoting abstinence and safe sex activities.

"Today's face of HIV/AIDS has changed," said Peg McAllister, director of
Community Outreach and director of Keystone Health's HIV/AIDS program. "HIV/AIDS
is not just an illness contracted by gay men; anyone having unprotected sexual
relations including teenagers and grandmothers can get it."

The fastest growing group of local HIV/AIDS patients are young people of color,
she added.

All HIV/AIDS Services at Keystone Health Center are provided in part through
funds from the Pennsylvania Department of Health, Bureau of Communicable
Diseases, Division of HIV/AIDS and through a grant from the Federal Department
of Health and Human Services, Health Resources and Services Administration.

By the numbers, testing services

Worldwide, 39.5 million people are living with HIV, including 2.3 million
children, according to www.avert.org. This year, 4.3 million people became newly
infected with the virus. Around half of all people who become infected with HIV
do so before they are 25 and are killed by AIDS before they are 35.

HIV/AIDS testing:

-- Keystone Family Medicine, 820 Fifth Ave., Chambersburg. Free and
confidential, it is available from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Mondays to Fridays. No
appointment is necessary. For testing information, call 263-4313, Ext. 158.

-- The Pennsylvania Department of Health, Cleveland Avenue, Chambersburg. For
more information, call 263-4143.

World AIDS Day service

In recognition of World AIDS Day, the Chambersburg United Methodist churches,
including St. Paul United Methodist, First United Methodist and Park Avenue
United Methodist churches, are sponsoring a special service at 7:30 p.m. today
in St. Paul United Methodist Church, 750 Norland Ave., Chambersburg. The guest
speaker is Jodi Link whose husband, the late Rev. Kendall Link, was a victim of
AIDS. There will be an opportunity for candlelighting in memory of those lost to
AIDS. The service will be led by the pastors of the three United Methodist
churches.

Aid needs more than fine words;
G20 SUMMIT 2006 AUSTRALIA

BYLINE: MATTHEW CLARKE and SIMON FEENY

SECTION: NEWS; Opinion; Pg. 17

LENGTH: 908 words


The G20 meeting provides an opportunity to improve the lot of the world's
poorest people. But will it deliver, ask Matthew Clarke and Simon Feeny.

WHAT can we expect from the G20 meeting to be held in Melbourne later this week?
Will it simply be a talk-fest or will it lead to action that will improve the
circumstances of the poor? Well, if the best indicator of future behaviour is
past behaviour, it might be possible to make some predictions.

The G20 consists of finance ministers and central bank governors from the
world's largest economies. Since 1999, it has met annually to discuss the
important issues in supporting economic growth, increasing stability and
promoting international development. In addition to Australia, other members
include a mix of wealthy countries, including Canada, France, Germany, Italy,
Japan, Britain and the United States, as well as poorer countries such as China,
India, Indonesia and South Africa. The European Union is also included as a
member, and senior members of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund are
invited to take part in the annual meetings. Make no mistake - it is an
important gathering that has serious international clout.

The importance of the G20 countries is demonstrated by member countries
accounting for about 90 per cent of the world's output, 80 per cent of world
trade and about two-thirds of the world's population. The actions of these
countries, especially the wealthy countries, can make a huge difference to the
lives of the poor, particularly in terms of overseas aid.

A report to be released tomorrow by the Make Poverty History campaign, Is the
G20 Making Poverty History?, reviews the record of overseas aid by these wealthy
countries across a range of criteria.

In total, these countries provide more than $US80 billion ($A104 billion) a year
in overseas aid. The United States provides the largest amount - nearly $US27
billion each year. Australia provides the least amount, only $US1.6 billion.

This comparison is perhaps unfair, as Australia's economy is much smaller than
that of the United States. A better comparison may be the percentage of overseas
aid to gross national income. In this regard, the United States performs quite
poorly, providing around 0.22 per cent of its GNI in aid compared with
Australia's 0.25 per cent. In this measure, the most generous of the G20
countries is France, which provides 0.48 per cent of GNI in overseas aid,
followed by Britain with 0.47 per cent.

It is also valuable to see how aid flows have changed over time as this might
provide some clues about possible aid flows in the future. All countries - apart
from Australia - have increased their overseas aid allocation since 2000. The
United States and Italy have more than doubled their aid and France and Britain
have increased their aid by nearly 50 per cent.

It is important to note that not all overseas aid can be spent at the discretion
of the recipient government; this aid is called "tied aid". All G20 member
countries agreed to continue untying their aid programs in the Paris Declaration
on Aid Effectiveness in 2005. Most countries have made important progress in
this. Britain has untied its entire aid program and France, Germany and Japan
had untied more than 90 per cent of their programs. Canada has increased its
percentage of untied aid but the country still has the lowest percentage of
untied aid, accounting for 57 per cent in 2004.

Least developed countries are the poorest countries in the world. There is a
strong case for providing them with the largest amounts of foreign assistance.
Between 2000 and 2004, all G20 aid donors increased the percentage of their aid
flows to these countries. In 2004, Britain and France provided the greatest
percentage of their aid programs to these poor countries while Japan and the US
provided the least.

Debt relief to poor countries is also important. Debt inhibits development in
many countries. This is particularly true for the "highly indebted poor
countries". These countries are crippled by unproductive debt that reduces their
capacity to fund basic services. In 2005, some of the wealthy G20 countries
agreed to cancel the debts of the world's poorest countries. This has already
allowed a number of African countries to increase the resources devoted to heath
care and education.

The G20 aid donors are increasingly providing developing countries with debt
relief as part of their official aid programs. But more could be done. One-fifth
of France's overseas aid is provided as debt relief.

So, talkfest or action plan? Based on past performances, we might feel confident
that some wealthy G20 countries will do as they say, but not all. Overall,
France and Britain have performed well across a range of foreign aid indicators
and so we might expect them to live up to their new promises. Canada, Germany,
Italy and the US have all performed fairly. But Japan and Australia have
performed poorly. On their past performances, we cannot rely on them to fulfil
any promises they might make in the next week.

In the end, if our governments are representative of our views then we must
continue to exert pressure so they do all they can to make poverty history.
Let's see what they promise and then make sure they deliver.

Feeny is a research fellow at the university. The are co-authors of the report

Clinton's Director Of Policy on AIDS Resigns Under Fire

BYLINE: By PHILIP J. HILTS,   Special to The New York Times

SECTION: Section 1;  Page 1;  Column 1;  National Desk

LENGTH: 1012 words

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 8


President Clinton's chief AIDS policy officer, Kristine M. Gebbie, submitted her
resignation today after a rocky 11-month tenure.

Her resignation had been rumored here for weeks. Advocates for people with AIDS
had been unhappy with Ms. Gebbie ever since she was named and it became clear
that she would not be the sort of high-profile AIDS "czar" that the Clinton
campaign had promised.

Experts in AIDS policy said today that Ms. Gebbie, a former Washington State
health commissioner, had been hampered by the ill-defined nature of her job. And
while they credited her with good intentions, they said a lack of political
savvy had prevented her from making something of a job with little authority.

The budget for AIDS care and research has increased substantially under Mr.
Clinton, and prevention programs are being completely reorganized -- two of the
major demands that groups active on behalf of people with AIDS and H.I.V., the
virus that causes AIDS, made before Mr. Clinton's election. But Ms. Gebbie was
seen as having little to do with those developments.

In a telephone interview today, Ms. Gebbie said: "A little less than a year ago
I moved into a vacuum here, with enormous and conflicting expectations. I think
we have done things this year, and I feel good about it, but it is time for
someone else to try."

'Expectations Were Too High'

Commenting on her troubles with the job, Ms. Gebbie said: "This was a new job
with almost nothing written down about what it should be, and expectations were
too high. Some people will never be happy about this position unless it is the
job of a real czar who can command viruses, money and jobs."

She said she had spoken today to Leon E. Panetta, the White House chief of
staff, about the need to better define the job for her successor, and had urged
him to make it clear that the job was "that of a policy coordinator between
agencies."

Ms. Gebbie was roundly criticized by AIDS organizations as being ineffective,
and earlier this year some groups, including Act Up and the National Association
of People with AIDS, called for her resignation.

Daniel Bross, executive director of the AIDS Action Council, the chief lobbying
group for the nation's AIDS groups, said today: "There has been incredible
dissatisfaction with both the office and the person. I think the issue is both."


'Ill-Defined Job and Mission'

While adding that he had "never seen a more ill-defined job and mission," he
also said Ms. Gebbie had failed to enlist the support of members of Congress or
AIDS organizations in trying to devise a national policy on AIDS research and
care for people with AIDS. The result, he said, was a complete failure of policy
despite Ms. Gebbie's dedication and good intentions.

Jane Silver, chief of the Washington office of the American Foundation for AIDS
Research, said the resignation presented "a chance for a new start," and added:
"Up to now we have had sincerity and commitment, but now we need the leadership.
We need to make a national AIDS plan."

Experts in AIDS policy said that the job of AIDS policy coordinator existed only
because Mr. Clinton promised to create it during the 1992 Presidential campaign
to counter the Bush Administration's AIDS policies.

'Manhattan Project' for AIDS

At the time, Mr. Clinton even referred to the possibility of mounting a
"Manhattan project" to fight AIDS, a reference to the nation's World War II
effort that developed the atomic bomb, and of appointing a White House official
who would have the authority to command action on AIDS.

But once Mr. Clinton became President, the parameters of the job became less
ambitious. At the same time, the Administration began changing AIDS policies
without the presence of a White House coordinator, diminishing the perceived
need for an official with authority over multiple agencies.

Other issues remain contentious, and AIDS organizations continue to press for
policy changes on several fronts. But AIDS experts said today that it was
unclear whether anyone in the job of AIDS coordinator could do much to resolve
immigration issues, for example, or those involving needle exchanges.

It is still not legal for people with AIDS to enter the United States without a
waiver. The needle exchange programs are intended to cut down on H.I.V. among
intravenous drug users, one of the groups in which AIDS is spreading most
rapidly.

Expanding the Dialogue

Ms. Gebbie was the Commissioner of the Washington State Department of Health for
three years and was working on her Ph.D. in nursing when the White House invited
her to be the AIDS policy coordinator after several candidates, including Gov.
Lowell P. Weicker Jr. of Connecticut, turned down the post, fearing that it
would carry little authority.

Ms. Gebbie, who was criticized by some AIDS experts for spending too much time
making speeches outside Washington, said today that she believed her travels had
been "one of the most important things we did this past year, opening up a wider
dialogue with mainstream groups, such as Campfire boys and girls, and with
mainstream religious groups that had never been brought into the issue before."

She said another thing she was proud of in her tenure was the establishment of
new Federal rules requiring all agencies to educate their employees about AIDS
and to train supervisors in how to deal with employees who have H.I.V. She said
that almost half the employees of the largest agencies in the Federal Government
have already undergone their first round of education and training.

The names of a number of possible successors have been discussed among White
House officials, but selection is still at an early stage, an Administration
official said.

Among those known to be under discussion are Timothy Westmoreland, a staff
member working on AIDS and other health issues for the House Subcommittee on
Health and the Environment, and Dr. Margaret A. Hamburg, the New York City
Health Commissioner, who declined the job last year because she was pregnant at
the time.

AIDS not waning, activists warn; Petition designed to urge government to
maintain funding

BYLINE: SHELLEY PAGE; CITIZEN

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A8


AIDS activists fear their funding will dwindle because of "false" claims that
the condition isn't as rampant as previously thought.

So this week they're asking Canadians to sign a petition demanding the federal
government keep up the fight against AIDS. They hope that will show AIDS is
still a big public concern.

"People are saying AIDS is behind us, it isn't as big as we once thought. We're
afraid politicians will be influenced by this," said Richard Burzynski,
executive director of the Canadian AIDS Society.

In June 1990 the federal government agreed to spend $ 112 million -- or about $
36 million a year -- over three years to fight AIDS. The commitment runs out
next March, and a Health and Welfare official said a proposal is being prepared
for cabinet on what to do next.

The Canadian AIDS Society, which represents 72 community groups across the
country, says $ 55 million a year would help fund community-based education
programs and enhance research.

Burzynski complained AIDS is being "pitted against" other ailments, and
statistics are being manipulated to show AIDS is not as serious and therefore
deserves less funding.

He referred to comparisons with breast cancer. Some women have complained breast
cancer gets only about $ 4 million a year. Last year, 5,000 women lost their
lives to breast cancer. Seventy-two people died of AIDS in 1991.

"You can't compare a contagious epidemic that affects mainly young people and
put it together with other kinds of diseases out there," Burzynski said.

AIDS is the leading cause of death among women and men between the ages of 24
and 44 in Toronto and Montreal, he said. One in 900 pregnant women in
Newfoundland was infected with HIV, the virus linked to AIDS, six times higher
than expected.

"Those are the type of statistics people should be looking at. Not the kind of
number-crunching that's being done by some researchers with no interest in AIDS.

"AIDS and breast cancer are different . . . but they suffer from the same
problem -- marginalization."

AIDS activists were on Sparks Street Monday collecting signatures on a petition.

"We're hear to remind people that AIDS is still an issue. We're not tired, and
we're going to keep fighting," said Kevin Gibbs, who's on the board of directors
for the local AIDS hospice, Bruce House.

The petitions will be delivered to MPs. The campaign also marked the beginning
of AIDS Awareness Week. People are being encouraged to wear a red ribbon in
remembrance of those who have lost their lives due to AIDS.

One in 10,000 Canadians is living with AIDS and one in 1,000 is HIV positive.
HIV, or human immunodeficiency virus, causes AIDS by disabling the immune
system.

AIDS VICTIMS 'JUMP QUEUE' FOR CITY UNITS

BYLINE: CANDACE SUTTON and STEVE WARNOCK

SECTION: NEWS AND FEATURES; Pg. 9

LENGTH: 908 words


The NSW Housing Department is giving rental priority to dying AIDS sufferers
despite claims from angry residents - and public servants - that the cheap
government housing blocks are becoming ghettos for the terminally ill.

It is believed at least 15 AIDS victims who were paying $23 a week for
inner-city flats have died in the past 20 months, three from one block alone in
recent months.

One AIDS sufferer living at the Poplar St, Surry Hills, Housing Department block
allegedly jumped to his death four months ago from a 10th floor apartment.

And while authorities doubt claims AIDS victims have actually died in the units,
one inner-city tenant told The Sun-Herald she has seen body bags taken from
flats.

The woman claimed she had "cleaned and washed" the body of a New Zealand-born
friend who died in a neighbouring unit last year.

The man, in his early 40s, had full-blown AIDS but was found dead with a
hyperdermic syringe in his arm.

Anger is mounting over claims of priority to AIDS victims effectively allowing
them to "jump the queue" ahead of leukemia and cancer sufferers on the State's
86,000 waiting list.

The Sun-Herald has been told some dying AIDS sufferers are housed within three
months while pensioners and the poor sometimes waited for years.

'PHANTOM' TENANTS

The rumbling of discontent - not only from residents but public servants who
have privately slammed what they consider to be preferential considerations for
AIDS sufferers - is another thorn in the side of the NSW Housing Department.

The department, and NSW Housing Minister Joe Schipp, have been embroiled in rows
over the rich living in "dirt cheap" government accommodation, "phantom"tenants
renting vacant flats and allegations tenants are living rent-free but
sub-letting to boarders.

In the latest row, tenants say they feel compassion for the dying AIDS sufferers
but believe authorities should consider tenant "interests" before allowing the
AIDS victims to share the blocks.

"Every time you get a vacancy you get another AIDS sufferer in this place,"Ms
Jan Williams, who lives in the Poplar St block, said yesterday.

"It might sound cruel but tenants should be considered before housing is
allocated to AIDS sufferers.

"Number two Poplar St is getting more like a hospice than a public tenants
place."

A NSW Housing Department spokesman said more than 20 AIDS sufferers are housed
in city Housing Department blocks. These include Glebe, Northcott at Surry
Hills, and Poet's Corner at Redfern.

Anyone seeking priority housing on sickness grounds must submit relevant
documentation, but AIDS patients don't always supply medical records - an
indicator to officials that the priority applicants suffer from AIDS.

A department spokesman said all priority applicants must meet stringent
criteria.

The department did not discriminate against AIDS sufferers and believed it was
"fulfilling a role" in housing them.

"If they fit (the criteria) they are housed - it amounts to jumping the queue,"
the spokesman said.

"If they wish to disclose they are AIDS sufferers it would not form any part of
the (department's) criteria for consideration."

Dr Julian Gold, director of the Albion Street Aids Centre, which treats many of
the dying Housing Department tenants, said of 870 diagnosed cases of full-blown
AIDS in NSW about 460 had died and deaths were "certainly on the increase".

"They will continue to increase. It is not usually a problem getting people into
a hospice. But generally they would rather die at home," he said.

"Albion Street has 180 volunteers who provide emotional support, become a
surrogate family.

"But housing and shopping are things which have to be provided in Sydney by the
AIDS Council of NSW (ACON)."

Ms Ruth Cotton, manager of the AIDS Bureau (a division of ACON), said the
confidentiality of individual AIDS patients in public housing must be
maintained.

"However, if there is going to be a ghetto-isation, the issue must be looked at
seriously by ACON and the Housing Department because putting large numbers of
AIDS patients in one building leads to stigmatisation," Ms Cotton said.

"I would think sprinkling and mainstreaming throughout a large number of public
housing buildings would be much better.

"AIDS patients often face a housing crisis because their family and friends may
abandon them or they may get thrown out of rented accommodation."

Ms Cotton said it was really "no-one's business if a person with AIDS is placed
in public housing".

"But if large numbers are put in one place, that is the time to involve and
inform residents so they may take a compassionate approach.

HUMAN BEINGS

"AIDS victims are human beings. But if you were one of the other residents in a
building full of AIDS patients I suppose you need to be informed so you can cope
with it."

One housing department resident told The Sun-Herald a post mortem was not
conducted on the body of a friend who had AIDS and had died in the Poplar St
block.

ACON executive director, Mr Bill Whittaker, said the question of post mortems
for AIDS patients was still under industrial negotiation.

"There is a very high degree of ignorance we have been trying to overcome which
is not helped by the fact we don't have the facilities to do autopsies on people
with AIDS. And there could have been a miscarriage of justice.

"I can think of one case when a person who had AIDS died and there was some
reasonable doubt as to whether they had died from AIDS or had been murdered.

"The case has been unresolved."

AIDS Patients Are Found to Have an Extremely High Suicide Rate

AIDS patients are committing suicide at a far higher rate than the general
population, and at a higher rate even than among people with other fatal
diseases, according to a new study of patients in New York City.

The findings mean that doctors and family members should be on the alert for
signs that AIDS patients may want to take their lives and should intervene early
with counseling and psychiatric care, experts said.

The study examined data on suicides and AIDS patients in New York City in 1985.
Of 3,825 individuals who were alive with AIDS in all or part of that year, 12
were known to have taken their own lives. These data indicate that men with AIDS
were 36 times more likely to commit suicide than the entire population of men 20
to 59 years old, and 66 times more likely than the general population.

Data on Women Inconclusive

The study included both men and women, but none of the women with AIDS
commmitted suicide. The researchers said there were too few women with AIDS to
draw any conclusion on a suicide rate.

The study, which was published in the current issue of The Journal of the
American Medical Association, was directed by Dr. Peter Marzuk, a psychiatrist
at Cornell University Medical College in New York.

Dr. Marzuk and his colleagues from the Cornell Medical College and New York
City's Office of the Chief Medical Examiner noted that the suicide rate in AIDS
patients was markedly higher than the rate in cancer patients and in patients
with many other chronic and eventually fatal diseases, but is comparable to the
suicide rate among some groups of patients with mental illnesses. The
researchers did not determine whether the AIDS patients in their study suffered
mental impairment, which sometimes accompanies AIDS.

The study should ''certainly bring more attention to the possiblity of suicides
among AIDS patients,'' said Dr. Richard Glass of the University of Chicago. Dr.
Glass, who wrote an editorial in the journal commenting on Dr. Marzuk's study,
also said that many doctors were not sensitive to signs that AIDS patients were
considering suicide. He added that the findings suggest the importance of proper
counseling of patients found to be infected with the AIDS virus in screening
tests.

Median Age Was 36

Others dealing with AIDS patients emphasized that most AIDS patients do not
commit suicide. They noted that while no one has been cured of AIDS, there are
now drugs such as AZT, which can prolong the lives of some patients, and
improved treatments for AIDS-related pneumonia. As a consequence, the prognosis
for AIDS patients is looking less bleak.

Those in the study who committed suicide had been diagnosed with acquired immune
deficiency syndrome within the last nine months and had not been seriously ill
at the time of their deaths. They had a median age of 36 and none had records of
drug abuse. Nine were homosexual or bisexual; the risk factors for AIDS virus
infection for the other three were unknown.

In every instance, the patient's death was clearly a suicide, not an accident,
Dr. Marzuk said. He said the study may have underestimated the true suicide rate
among AIDS victims, especially among intravenous drug users whose deaths may be
attributed to drug overdoses or other causes.

''Most of the time, suicide is very preventable, if you catch people early,''
Dr. Marzuk said. He added that some AIDS patients who killed themselves might
have done so because their cries for help went unrecognized or unheeded. He said
it could be more difficult to prevent suicides in patients who became mentally
unbalanced because the AIDS virus affected their brains.

Dr. Marzuk advised that doctors and family members of AIDS patients be attuned
to signs that the patients need help. ''They should be on the lookout for
despondancy and hopelessness and talk of suicide and giving up,'' he said.

At the Gay Men's Health Crisis, a private group in New York that provides
support for AIDS patients, volunteers are trained to recognize and get help for
patients with suicidal behavior.

Helene Kendler, who is assistant coordinator of crisis intervention services at
Gay Men's Health Crisis, said that the majority of the AIDS patients who are
served by the group are ''living with, rather than dying of, AIDS.''

THE DOCTOR'S WORLD;
STUDIES OF YOUNG DOCTORS FIND ANXIETY ABOUT CARING FOR AIDS PATIENTS

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN, M.D., Special to the New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 8


The AIDS epidemic is having a draining and emotional impact on doctors, forcing
some hospitals to develop special programs to help physicians cope. Other
hospitals are being urged to recognize this new facet of the AIDS problem and
develop similar programs.

Young doctors in training who treat many AIDS patients are suffering nightmares,
becoming preoccupied with the fear of getting the fatal disease, imagining they
have become infected with the virus and reporting other forms of marked anxiety.

These observations come from questionnaires answered by doctors in training at
hospitals in New York and San Francisco in studies to assess distress from
treating patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The hospitals were
New York University and Bellevue Hospital in New York, Montefiore Hospital and
Albert Einstein Medical School in the Bronx, and the University of California at
San Francisco.

Although the studies were not intended to measure the effect, if any, that the
doctors' stress has on their care of both AIDS patients and other patients, the
overwhelming majority of the doctors studied said they believed their anxieties
about AIDS did not adversely affect patient care.

The authors of the reports, presented last week at the Third International
Conference on AIDS, called for more studies to measure the effects on doctors,
on other health care workers and on patient care.

The two studies did not include nurses and other health care workers. But many
AIDS experts believe the stress of caring for so many people dying in the prime
of life is producing similar emotional stresses in these workers, too.

The AIDS-related emotional problems in health care workers is especially serious
because the the epidemic is sure to get worse before it gets better. Public
Health Service officials have predicted that by the end of 1991, AIDS will have
struck 270,000 Americans. So far 36,000 cases have been reported.

At the same time, a fourth of the 258 doctors surveyed in the New York study
said they believed it was not unethical to refuse to care for people infected
with the AIDS virus.

This is a surprising and disturbing challenge to the longstanding tradition that
doctors will render care to those in need, and, if necessary, risk their lives
to do so. That credo has contributed in a major way to the prestige of the
profession.

''The view that doctors may refuse care to patients appears to undermine the
tacit social contract that has long existed between physicians and their
communities,'' Dr. R. Nathan Link, who headed the team doing the study, told the
AIDS conference. ''Whether these views reflect trends that will compromise the
level of medical care that will be available to AIDS patients remains
undetermined.''

Some participants in the conference said the reluctance expressed by the young
doctors reflected a failure by medical schools to teach the traditions of the
profession.

The questionnaires did not ask the respondents to explain their anxieties. But
the authors and those working with AIDS patients have offered many explanations,
including these:

* Physicians are frustrated by their inability to offer a cure for AIDS. Today's
medical students are accustomed to being able to cure and treat effectively many
life-threatening diseases that once killed patients of their older colleagues.

* Most doctors in training are young adults from the same generation as many
AIDS patients. Identifying with young AIDS victims, the physicians find it
difficult to confront their own mortality.

There was one positive note about the doctors' attitudes as expressed in the
studies. The more experience the doctors had in caring for AIDS patients and the
more medical training they have. the more satisfication they said they derived
from their work.

The AIDS epidemic has come at a time when many more women are becoming doctors,
and the San Francisco study showed a striking difference in attitudes and stress
reactions according to the sex of the physician. The men were more likely to
show stress, in contrast to the usually observed tendency for women to report
more job-related stress than their male counterparts.

Of the 56 doctors in the San Francisco study, 91 percent described themselves as
''at least mildly anxious,'' according to Dr. Molly Cooke, who led the San
Francisco team. She said male physicians were more likely to report moderate or
marked anxiety and less likely to report absence of anxiety. Also, Dr. Cooke
said, more male than female physicians reported having unpleasant dreams and
nightmares.

Whereas 84 percent of male doctors believed that health care workers were at
risk for developing AIDS as a result of their work rather than any association
with such high-risk groups as male homosexuals and intravenous drug users, only
48 percent of the female physicians did.

The differences in attitudes made a difference in extra time spent with AIDS
patients: More male than female physicians tended to avoid entering an AIDS
patient's room when such visits were not medically essential.

As possible explanations, Dr. Cooke said, perhaps male doctors are more uneasy
with the male homosexuality implied in the diagnosis of AIDS in San Francisco,
or perhaps female doctors are temperamentally more comfortable with care that is
fundamentally palliative.

In the New York study, the 258 doctors surveyed were being training in internal
medicine and pediatrics. Those in internal medicine cared for an average of 39
AIDS patients, or 15 percent of all their patients. The pediatricians averaged
10 AIDS patients, or 5 percent of their total cases. Only two physicians in the
study had never cared for any AIDS patient.

Health care workers have a very small but real occupational risk of becoming
infected with the AIDS virus. Sixty-six of the doctors had stuck themselves a
total of 95 times with a needle contaminated with blood from an AIDS patient.

The number of such incidents was not surprising considering the number of tests
done on each AIDS patient in long hospital stays. Dr. Link said he had twice
stuck himself with a contaminated needle. Federal health authorities say,
however, that the risk of AIDS virus infection even after a needle stick is
slight; only a handful of medical workers are known to have been infected this
way.

The studies did not measure fatigue as a factor in such accidents, such as by
correlating the number of hours the doctors had worked.

Most doctors said they thought about the risk of developing AIDS once a month,
but 40 percent said they thought about the risk at least weekly and 9 percent
every day. About half the doctors examined themselves for swollen lymph nodes
and other evidence of AIDS, and nine percent actually suspected at some point
that they had the disease.

For centuries, many doctors have risked their lives caring for patients with
tuberculosis and other infectious diseases that, unlike AIDS, could be spread
through the air or through casual person-to-person contact.

And, as the young doctors in the two studies illustrate, many doctors are caring
for AIDS patients today. Still, some have refused to operate and do autopsies
and have abandoned patients with other problems upon learning the patients were
infected with the AIDS virus.

Physicians' abandoning patients is not new. Many doctors have fled from
epidemics throughout history, although there is no way to compare directly the
attitudes of physicians of earlier times with those of today.

Still, the fear of getting the disease for which one treats a patient and the
current despair in not being able to cure young AIDS patients must be recognized
for their potential impact on the care of the many people who will develop AIDS
and on the makeup of the next generation of physicians.

WIDER AIDS DEFINITION PROPOSED IN MOVE TO EXPAND U.S. BENEFITS

BYLINE: By RONALD SULLIVAN

SECTION: Section A; Page 1, Column 3; National Desk

LENGTH: 1452 words


Federal officials have proposed an expanded definition of AIDS in a move that
will increase the recorded number of cases by 20 percent and make important
social benefits available to thousands of additional patients.

The revised definition of conditions leading to diagnosis of acquired immune
deficiency syndrome will be presented to a conference of state health officials
next month, and their agreement is expected, officials said yesterday.

''This will alleviate, to a major degree, a significant undercounting of the
AIDS epidemic in New York, particularly among intravenous drug users,'' said
Stephen C. Joseph, New York City Health Commissioner.

Two Illnesses Would Be Added

The revisions, proposed by the Federal Centers for Disease Control, would add
dementia and emaciation to the list of illnesses that are officially recognized
by the Centers for Disease Control as confirming a diagnosis of AIDS in patients
who are infected with the AIDS virus.

Dementia, an illness similar to Alzheimer's disease, causes a loss of brain
function. The illness, along with emaciation, in which the body wastes away, are
two of the most common and tragic symptoms of AIDS in its earliest stages.

Health and social service officials in New York City said the expanded
definition would have a major impact, enabling thousands of patients with AIDS
-related illnesses to qualify for millions of dollars in benefits from publicly
financed health and social assistance programs now reserved only for patients
who have officially been diagnosed as AIDS cases.

Effect on Patient Benefits

The new definitions will automatically entitle patients with AIDS-related
dementia and emaciation to monthly Social Security disability payments and a
variety of housing and social services reserved for AIDS patients, city
officials said. They also will permit those AIDS patients who are addicted to
drugs to jump to the front of long waiting lists at drug abuse treatment centers
and methadone maintenance programs.

If cases that fell within the expanded definition were included, the total of
34,500 AIDS cases since 1981 when the disease was first diagnosed would increase
to more than 41,000, officials said.

Officials estimate that as many as 1.5 million Americans may be infected with
the AIDS virus, which spreads through sexual intercourse with an infected person
or through transfers of blood. An unknown number of infected people will
eventually develop AIDS or related disorders.

The revisions will also raise the number of AIDS cases as patients with dementia
and emaciation, sometimes also referred to as the wasting syndrome, many of them
previously diagnosed as having AIDS-related complex, or ARC, are counted as
full-scale AIDS cases.

''The curve will jump right up,'' said Dr. Richard Vogt, president of the
Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists.

A spokeswoman for the Federal centers in Atlanta, Betty Hooper, said yesterday
that the revisions would be presented for approval to the council's annual
conference in Sante Fe, N.M., beginning May 17.

''We expect that the C.D.C. recommendation to add dementia and the wasting
syndrome to the current AIDS case definition will be adopted,'' Ms. Hooper said.


Favorable Reaction Expected

Dr. Vogt, Vermont's state epidemiologist, said in a telephone interview that he
expected the council ''to look favorably'' on expanding the case definition.
Federal officials have said they would not adopt the new definition without the
state officials' approval.

AIDS is caused by a virus that can cripple the body's immune defense system,
leaving victims prey to a variety of deadly infections that a normal immune
system would easily fight off.

Under current criteria, to be diagnosed as having AIDS a patient must show
evidence of a damaged immune system and the presence of at least one of the
officially recognized cancers or opportunistic infections, such as Kaposi's
sarcoma or pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, two of the most prevalent AIDS
infections.

The initial AIDS case definition was approved in 1981 before there was a blood
test that could detect the AIDS virus antibody. The last revision, approved in
1985, said that patients who had a positive antibody test and certain other
conditions, such as non-Hodgkins lymphoma, should be classified as having AIDS.
But this added relatively few cases to the total.

According to the New York City Department of Health, a total of 10,116 AIDS
cases have been reported here so far, 5,862 of which have already ended in
death. The major risk groups are sexually active homosexual men, who account for
over half the cases, and intravenous drugs users, whose precentage of total
cases has doubled over the last few years, rising to 34 percent.

Visible and Troubling Symptoms

In the six years since AIDS was first diagnosed, dementia and emaciation were
highly visible and extremely troubling symptoms. However, since they were not
included as officially designated opportunistic infections, patients who had
them and not officially designated illnesses generally were designated as ARC
cases.

What this meant, said Audrey Hasselle, coordinator of financial advocacy of the
Gay Mens health Crisis, the major AIDS volunteer organization in the city, was
that demented and emaciated patients who could not work and often could not take
care of themselves were denied the full social and disability benefits given
AIDS patients.

For example, she said an ARC patient could only qualify for a $196 a month rent
subsidy from the Human Resources Administration, while a patient with AIDS could
receive from $500 to $600 a month in rent subsidies, along with monthly Social
Security disability benefits and a number of home-care services.

''The tragedy,'' she said, ''was that many ARC patients with dementia or who
were wasting away could not hold a job or take care of themselves and the city
simply wouldn't touch them.''

The total Federal, state and city budget for AIDS treatment in the city is $277
million, most of it allocated for the care of about 1,000 AIDS hospital
patients.

According to Frances Tarlton, a spokeswoman for the State Department of Health,
the state Medicaid payment system to hospitals for AIDS patients already
includes the higher rate for ARC patients.

''We believe that it is now time for a new AIDS case definition to reflect these
two illnesses,'' said Dr. Vogt of dementia and emaciation.

However, he said an important concern was that ''tinkering'' with the case
definition would undermine the statistical structure that tells the history of
AIDS and projects its increase in the future.

Based on the existing definition of AIDS, Federal epidemiologists have projected
a total of 270,000 cases nationwide by the end of 1991.

''As new infections present themselves, the case definition will continue to
expand,'' said Dr. Rand Stoneburner, director of AIDS research in the New York
City Health Department.

FUND VOTED FOR AIDS TREATMENT

WASHINGTON, April 30 (Special to The New York Times) - The Senate Appropriations
Committee today voted to provide $30 million to pay for the cost of treating
low-income AIDS victims with the drug AZT or any other drug that proves
effective against AIDS.

The committee approved the expenditure without discussion in discussing a
supplemental appropriations bill for health programs for the remainder of the
fiscal year 1987.

The $30 million appropriation was proposed by Senator Lowell P. Weicker Jr.,
Republican of Connecticut, and had bipartisan support.

The appropriation seeks to help individuals pay the great cost of treatment with
AZT, the only drug that has so far been proven effective in extending the lives
of AIDS victims. A year of treatment with AZT is expected to cost from $7,000 to
$10,000, according to the manufacturer, the Burroughs Wellcome Company. Some
health insurance plans will pay for the treatment, but others will not.

Many state Medicaid plans, which serve low-income citizens, have agreed to pay
for AZT, but individuals above the Medicaid income eligibility levels would have
to impoverish themselves first to qualify.

The provision approved today would provide money to the state in accord with
their total number of AIDS cases. The states, in turn, would determine how to
distribute it to low-income individuals not covered by Medicaid or other
insurance or in states where Medicaid does not pay for AZT.

The Senate committee urged the states to give highest priority to some 5,000
individuals who have been receiving AZT already without charge and must now pay
for it.

PROSTTUTES' IMPACT ON SPREAD OF AIDS IS DEVELOPED

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

SECTION: Section C; Page 1, Column 1; Science Desk

LENGTH: 2101 words


A SCIENTIFIC debate has emerged over whether prostitutes are likely to spread
AIDS among heterosexuals, a group that has largely been spared by the nation's
AIDS epidemic up to now. Many scientists, including New York City's health
authorities, say the fear that prostitutes will be a major conduit of acquired
immune deficiency syndrome into the heterosexual community is unjustified. They
argue that while many American prostitutes are at risk of developing AIDS
themselves, there is no evidence they are transmitting AIDS to their patrons and
that, more generally, the spread of the AIDS virus from women to men through
sexual contact has rarely been documented.

Other scientists believe that consorting with prostitutes has already caused
some cases of AIDS in men, and that if current trends continue prostitutes could
transmit the virus to many men, who in turn will infect their unsuspecting wives
and lovers.

None of the experts see the AIDS virus coursing through the heterosexual
community the way it has among homosexuals and intravenous drug addicts over the
last six years. But the outcome of the debate will influence whether authorities
single out prostitutes for AIDS-related testing, pursue special campaigns to
educate the women and their potential customers about the dangers or contemplate
new curbs on prostitution.

By all accounts, the number of AIDS cases spread by prostitutes in the United
States has been minuscule. The number of men whose AIDS is attributed to sexual
relations with any woman, in fact, remains small: only 16 cases out of the more
than 14,000 reported to date. However, heterosexual contacts, including visits
to prostitutes, are the prime suspects in scores of other unexplained cases of
AIDS, an incurable disease that destroys the body's immune defenses.

Federal authorities say more than one million Americans, only some of whom will
become ill as a result, may now be carrying the AIDS virus and can potentially
spread it to others.

The controversy over prostitutes turns in large part on a related debate over
the ease with which the AIDS virus can spread sexually from women to men.
''Prostitutes pose a theoretical risk of AIDS transmission, but not a practical
one,'' said Dr. Stephen Schultz, Deputy Health Commissioner for Epidemiological
Services of New York City. ''If it has occurred at all it has been very, very
infrequent.'' City officials do not attribute a single one of the city's 4,821
AIDS cases to sexual relations with a prostitute, although some private
physicians believe this is true of several cases.

Other scientists point to areas of central Africa where, many researchers
contend, the virus is being spread sexually from women to men with some
regularity, especially by prostitutes. These scientists worry that through
prostitution and other routes the AIDS virus may become widely embedded in the
American heterosexual community years before the resulting surge in AIDS cases
makes this known.

''We still don't know how efficient the transmission of the AIDS virus is'' from
women to men, admitted Dr. Michael Marmor of the New York University Medical
Center. ''But waiting for AIDS to break out is waiting too long.''

Dr. Marmor said he had urged the city to survey prostitutes for AIDS virus
infection more than a year ago and that ''things haven't moved as quickly as
they could have.'' In his view, better information about the prevalence of
infection among prostitutes could then form the basis for strong warnings about
the danger to potential customers of prostitutes, including out-of-town
visitors.

''I wouldn't fool around,'' Dr. Marmor said. ''I'd say caution in this case
means protecting people too much rather than too little.''

Children Born With AIDS

Dr. Schultz, on the other hand, argued that, in view of the lack of evidence
that prostitutes are spreading AIDS, sharper focus on them would only deflect
resources from far worse threats. ''The real up-and-coming story,'' he said,
''is the sexual partners of drug addicts, and their babies. We have 85 children
born with AIDS in New York and the number is increasing rapidly.''

All the experts agree that men consorting with prostitutes should use condoms,
both for their own safety and that of the women.

But AIDS experts warn that condoms cannot provide foolproof protection.
''Obviously it's much better to use them than not,'' said Dr. Robert C. Gallo of
the National Cancer Institute, a leading researcher on the AIDS virus. ''But we
don't know what aspects of intimate contact might spread the virus. Maybe its
heavy salivary exchange, or being bit in the mouth. We just don't know yet.''

Considerable debate about prostitutes and AIDS was provoked by a report in the
Oct. 18 issue of The Journal of the American Medical Association. Written by Dr.
Robert R. Redfield of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research and other
researchers, the study described nine military men with AIDS or related disease
whose only apparent exposure to the virus had been multiple heterosexual
contacts, including visits to prostitutes in the United States or abroad.
''Prostitutes could serve as a reservoir for HTLV-III infection for
heterosexually active individuals,'' the scientists concluded. HTLV-III is a
name for the AIDS virus.

Critics argue that military men are not apt to admit past homosexual encounters
or drug use since that can lead to a dishonorable discharge. Because of this,
said Dr. Joyce I. Wallace, a New York physician, ''the Army data are highly
suspect.''

''I think it's inaccurate epidemiology,'' said Dr. Schultz.

''The skepticism is, I believe, wishful thinking,'' responded Dr. Gallo, who was
a co-author of the disputed report. He said the investigations of the patients'
histories had been ''careful and thoughtful.'' Pentagon officials would not
allow Dr. Redfield, who directed the study, to comment.

''Why should there be any shock that men have been infected by prostitutes when
this has been abundantly shown in Africa?'' Dr. Gallo asked.

Dr. Gallo said that while the sexual spread of the AIDS virus from women to men
is far less frequent than the reverse, he is nonetheless ''positive'' it can
occur. ''I'm certainly concerned that prostitutes may spread AIDS,'' he said.

Preliminary studies show that some prostitutes in several American cities are
infected with the AIDS virus. In Miami, 10 of 25 prostitutes who visited a
clinic for testing had antibodies to the AIDS virus in their blood; 8 of the 10
admitted to intravenous drug use. In Seattle, 5 of 92 prostitutes tested showed
the antibody, a sign of probable viral infection.

New York Study Is Under Way

In New York, a state-financed survey of AIDS infection among prostitutes is
under way. Right now, the prevalence of the virus among prostitutes here can
only be imputed indirectly from estimates of drug addiction, believed to be
their major source of AIDS infection.

According to Don Des Jarlais of the state's Division of Substance Abuse
Services, drug addiction among prostitutes exists mainly among the subgroup
called streetwalkers. ''On the basis of interviews with arrested street
prostitutes,'' he said, ''it's clear that a substantial minority, perhaps
one-third, inject drugs.'' Surveys indicate that from 50 to 60 percent of New
York City's 200,000 intravenous drug addicts, most of them black or of Hispanic
descent, now carry the AIDS virus, which is spread by shared needles.

Dr. Des Jarlais said the evidence suggested that since the late 1970's some New
York streetwalkers have harbored the AIDS virus. However, he added, ''we haven't
seen the cases of AIDS among their customers that we should have seen by now if
they were transmitting the virus on a significant scale.''

He said this was apparently because most New York prostitutes use condoms and
avoid exchanges of body fluids. ''This is something prostitutes began promoting
among themselves even before AIDS, for which we can be thankful.''

Arleen Carmen, director of a Judson Memorial Church social program for
prostitutes and co-author of ''Working Women,'' a book about New York
streetwalkers, confirmed that the city's prostitutes routinely require their
customers to use condoms in both vaginal and oral sex. She said there is no
evidence that prostitutes are spreading AIDS, and she said she feared that
''they are becoming scapegoats.''

Miss Carmen, who said she has talked with hundreds of New York streetwalkers
over the last eight years, also challenged what she called the ''myth'' that
large numbers of them are drug addicts. ''I know what the attitude among these
women is,'' she said. ''A woman who is a junkie is scorned by the rest. And no
self-respecting pimp would want to keep a woman who is shooting up all the money
she makes.''

Role of Male Prostitutes Cited

Most experts believe that male homosexual prostitutes are likely to be spreading
AIDS on a far larger scale than female prostitutes, and note that the patrons
include bisexual men who can in turn infect women.

''We've seen a few male prostitutes in the hospital with AIDS,'' said Dr. Fred
Valentine of the New York University Medical Center. ''By now, it's virtually
certain that all of them are infected.''

Thousands of juvenile males, many of whom were rejected by their families or
foster homes for being homosexual, are homeless in New York and subsist by
selling their bodies, said A. Damien Martin, director of the Institute for the
Protection of Lesbian and Gay Youth. ''A high percentage of their customers''
are married men, according to Mr. Martin.

A recent case in Houston, where a male prostitute known to have AIDS persisted
in his trade until finally persuaded by health officials to enter a hospital,
has led Texas officials to request authority to quarantine individuals with
AIDS.

''We have no intention of quarantining the average AIDS case,'' said Robert
Bernstein, the Texas state health commissioner. ''But if we encounter an
incorrigible individual, this would give us the means to deal with it legally. I
wouldn't think this would happen very often.''

Mr. Martin, whose institute provides assistance to homosexual youths, argued
that the way to get young prostitutes off the streets is ''to give them homes,
jobs, and education.''

Officials in San Francisco have mounted an unusually comprehensive education
campaign against AIDS. ''Since last year we've told everybody, male or female,
gay or straight, not to have unprotected sex with anyone who has had multiple
sex partners since 1978,'' said Dr. Dean F. Echenberg of the San Francisco
health department.

But Dr. Echenberg said he saw no role for the quarantine of AIDS-infected
prostitutes or other sexually active individuals. ''It's not like TB or
typhoid,'' he said. ''With AIDS, it takes a consensual act to get infected.
Public education is the most important thing.'' Viral Infection And Disease
HAMPERING all predictions about the future course of AIDS is ignorance about how
many of those carrying the AIDS virus will eventually develop acquired immune
deficiency syndrome or other disorders. And, because most AIDS cases appear
years after infection, today's pattern of viral spread in the population will
only become evident in the years to come.

A few people have been diagnosed with AIDS within a few months of their
infection, according to Dr. Dean F. Echenberg of the San Francisco Department of
Health, but most have taken years and new cases are still appearing among people
infected five years ago.

Current estimates are mainly drawn from a group of homosexual men in San
Francisco whose blood had been sampled in a different study in 1979 and 1980,
just after the AIDS virus is believed to have appeared there. Of those who have
been infected for five years, 8 percent have developed AIDS and another 30
percent the lesser, though sometimes fatal, symptoms of AIDS-related complex.
Scientists cannot predict how many more will develop AIDS or other ailments that
might be caused by the virus. Nor can they say whether the disease pattern of
this sexually active group of homosexuals accurately foretells that of others.

Based on these and other limited data, Federal experts simply estimate that
between 5 and 10 percent of individuals develop AIDS within five years of
infection. ''It's clear that the majority of people infected so far have had no
consequences for their health at all,'' said Dr. Peter Drotman, an
epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control. ''But whether they'll stay
that way for the rest of their natural lives we truly don't know.''

SOVIET BLOC IS REPORTED TO INFLATE AID FIGURES

BYLINE: By RICHARD BERNSTEIN

LENGTH: 726 words

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, N.Y., Jan. 1


A British Government study of foreign aid contends that the aid given to
developing countries by the Soviet bloc is actually far smaller than the amounts
the Soviet Union and the Eastern European countries claim to give.

The Soviet Union, the study says, reported to the United Nations that it gave
$44 billion in aid between 1976 and 1980. The study asserts that the actual
amount of aid given was only $8 billion, which is a small part of the Soviet
gross national product.

''Soviet and East European aid generally compares unfavorably with that of
Western donors,'' the study says. The aid given, it adds, is a ''low proportion
of their G.N.P.'s and below the levels claimed recently by the U.S.S.R.'' and
East Germany.

A large group of aid recipients, moreover, receive ''negative aid'' from the
Soviet bloc countries, according to the study. The study says the repayments on
outstanding aid loans made by these countries are larger than the amount they
get in new aid from the Soviet bloc countries.

Evaluating Soviet Statements

The study was completed in May of this year by the British Economic Service of
the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and circulated privately among Western
delegations to the United Nations. It was undertaken to evaluate Soviet
statements, made to the United Nations Economic and Social Council, that, in
essence, the East bloc gives proportionally more aid to the third world than the
Western countries do.

The United Nations has set 0.7 percent of the gross national product as a target
for the industrialized nations to give as aid to the developing countries.

The Soviet Union, in statements to the United Nations, has said that its aid
rose from 0.9 percent of the gross national product in 1976 to 1.3 percent of
G.N.P. in 1980.

The British study says that total Soviet aid to other countries amounted to 0.19
percent of the Soviet gross national product in 1980, compared with a composite
total of 0.35 percent for the leading 17 Western aid-giving countries in 1981.
There is no sign, the study adds, that the amount of Soviet aid has increased
during the past three years.

The aid programs of the six Eastern European countries most closely linked to
Moscow are extremely small, according to the study. ''In recent years,'' it
says, ''the combined East European disbursements were less than those of one
relatively small Western donor alone, Belgium.''

Data Insufficient

The figures and estimates cited in the study are those of the British Government
and the Secretariat of the Development Assistance Committee, which is a
subcommittee of the 17 largest aid donors of the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development. The organization's 25 members are primarily Western
industrialized nations.

The study cites what it calls the ''best estimates'' available of the amounts
and the kind of aid disbursed by the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, the
nine-member Soviet-bloc economic cooperation and aid group. According to the
study, the data available suggest that ''the U.S.S.R.'s net aid disbursements
during 1976-80 were about $8 billion, not $44 billion as claimed.''

Most Goes to 6 Nations

The study says that in general Soviet aid is heavily concentrated on six
countries: Cuba, Mongolia, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and Afghanistan. The study
refers to these six as the Group 1 countries.

All other developing countries make up Group 2, the study says, and it is this
group that has received what it calls ''negative aid.''

The Group 1 countries, all of which are Communist-ruled and closely linked
politically to the Soviet Union, received an average of 65 percent of all Soviet
aid between 1976 and 1982, the study says; the figure was 76 percent in 1982.

In Group 2, a large share of the aid disbursed is composed of ''a few large
commitments,'' the study says. It mentions Morocco, India, Turkey and Bangladesh
as Group 2 countries that have received large amounts of aid from the Soviet
Union or the Eastern European countries.

''With the exception of these isolated large amounts, commitments to Group 2
countries were much lower than those to Group 1,'' the study says.

''Soviet net aid to Group 2 has been negative since 1980, with the net flow to
Group 2 during 1976-82'' amounting to minus $82 million, the study says.

 TEXT:
 [*525]


   INTRODUCTION

    When one considers competition law in the European Community ("Community" or
"EC"), it is useful to keep in mind the wording of Articles 2 and 3 of the
Treaty Establishing the European Community ("EC Treaty" or "Treaty").  n1
Article 2 states:

    The Community shall have as its task, by establishing a common market ...
and by implementing the common policies or activities referred to in Article[] 3
... to promote throughout the Community a harmonious and balanced development of
economic activities, sustainable and non-inflationary growth respecting the
environment, a high degree of convergence of economic performance, a high level
of employment and of social protection, the raising of the standard of living
and quality of life, and economic and social cohesion and solidarity among
member-States.  n2


    Article 3 states that "for the purpose set out in Article 2, the activities
of the Community shall include ... a system ensur [*526]  ing that competition
in the internal market is not distorted."  n3 The first Chapter of Title V of
the Treaty establishes "rules on competition" applying to undertakings  n4 and
to "aids granted by States."  n5 The provisions on competition of the Treaty
should also be read in the context of its preamble, in which the founding
fathers recognized that "the removal of existing obstacles calls for concerted
action in order to guarantee steady expansion, balanced trade and fair
competition."  n6

    As Helmuth R.B. Schroter stated a few years ago:



   The much broader scope of and plurality of aims pursued by EC competition
policy result in making antitrust analysis under Community law a more
complicated process than under the antitrust law of the United States which
considers "allocative efficiency/consumer welfare' as the sole valid standard.
n7


    These considerations have three consequences that are of particular
importance in understanding the way the EC competition law is designed or
enforced, and in understanding in particular the enforcement of the provisions
on state aids. The first element to bear in mind has to do with the concept of
competition, which underlies the EC Treaty. Among other things, competition must
be fair. As early as the 1960's, the Court of Justice stated that "the
elimination of barriers" and "fair competition" were both necessary to bring
about a single market.  n8

    As Schroter noted:



   According to the Commission, "the principle of fairness in the market' place
not only requires that equality of opportunity must be preserved for all
commercial operators in the Common Market. It also highlights the need to take
into account the great variety of situations in which firms carry on business
and to pay special regard to small and medium firms. Finally, it demands that
competition policy take account of the legitimate interests of workers, users
and consumers.  n9

 [*527]  In that sense the EC competition law not only protects the process of
competition, but also the competitors. In the area of restrictive agreements,
the issue of fairness does not come up very often, but one example quoted by
Waelbroeck  n10 is the first SABA decision, in which the Commission stated:



   The supply of goods by SABA wholesalers to private customers in Germany would
... be inappropriate in a multi-level system such as that operated by SABA, with
its clear definition of function between wholesalers and retailers. SABA
wholesalers would furthermore have an unfair competitive advantage over SABA
retailers. This type of unfair competitive advantage would not be protected by
Article 85.  n11


    Similarly, among the abuses prohibited by Article 86 are "directly or
indirectly imposing unfair purchase or selling prices or other unfair trading
conditions"  n12 and "applying dissimilar conditions to equivalent transactions
with other trading parties, thereby placing them at a competitive disadvantage."
n13 Commenting on the case law, Thomas E. Kauper states:



   The treatment under Article 86 of refusals to deal by dominant firms ... has
until recently had little to do with economic efficiency in the price-output,
consumer welfare sense. The Commission and Court of Justice cases concluding
that refusals to deal were abusive, like the examples set forth in Article 86
itself, have been based on a concern for fair treatment of distributors (where
competitive effects, if any, are to be found at the secondary level), or, in
some cases, upon the threatened exclusion of direct rivals (where at least
colorable arguments can be advanced to suggest that the refusals increase market
power and could therefore impair consumer welfare). In sum, these cases reflect
a mix of concerns more common to American antitrust of two decades past, and
give Article 86, because it is multi-valued, a highly regulatory quality Section
2 now lacks.  n14


    The second element to bear in mind is that the primary  [*528]  goal of the
EC competition policy is to unify the common market and to prevent private or
public market intervention that is or could be incompatible with such a common
market. For example, in the Metro case,  n15 the Court of Justice emphasized
that the objective of the Treaty regarding competition policy was to ensure "the
creation of a single market achieving conditions similar to those of a domestic
market."  n16 Schroter goes even further when he states that "in the EC
competition policy in general and antitrust policy in particular is primarily
"integration policy' aimed at bringing about a maximum of economic
inter-penetration and thus merging the separate national markets into a single
market of the Community."  n17

    This means that interventions in the market mechanism, whether private or
public, that establish directly a separation between national markets, such as
an export cartel or a price discrimination across national borders, are
prohibited. This also means that interventions, which establish differences in
the economic circumstances faced by potential competitors, are viewed with
extreme suspicion to the extent that the competitors affected are located in
different countries or that the intervention could apply to competitors located
in different Member States because they could directly or indirectly limit the
extent of economic inter-penetration between national markets.

    As Barry Hawk noted:



   The EC market integration goal results in both stricter rules and a different
method of substantive analysis than under US law... The market integration goal
is not necessarily consistent with other competition policy objectives, notably
promotion of efficiency. At the minimum there is tension (and possible
trade-offs) between strict legal rules based on market integration goal and
efficiencies, at least in the short term.  n18

In this case, the integration goal supersedes the efficiency goal as is
suggested by the 1991 report of the Commission on competition policy, which
states:  [*529]



   Competition policy has been an important Community instrument used both to
promote economic integration and to ensure an efficient allocation of resources.
Effective competition is the main stimulus to innovation and higher productivity
which underpins policies designed to increase economic growth and welfare. Not
only does competition lead to higher output but it also enables consumers to
obtain a fair share of this growth. Living standards therefore depend on the
maintenance of effective competition.  n19


    The third important feature of the EC competition law lies in the fact that
if the goal of EC competition law is to facilitate the emergence of the common
market, then the common market is not an end in itself. Rather, according to
Article 2, the common market is a means



   to promote throughout the Community a harmonious and balanced development of
economic activities, sustainable and non-inflationary growth respecting the
environment, a high degree of convergence of economic performance, a high level
of employment and of social protection, the raising of the standard of living
and quality of life, and economic and social cohesion and solidarity among
Member States.  n20

To achieve these broad goals, Article 3 of the Treaty states, among other
things, that the activities of the Community shall include a common policy in
the sphere of agriculture and fisheries, in the sphere of transport, in the
sphere of the environment, in the strengthening of economic and social cohesion,
in the strengthening of the competitiveness of Community industry, and in the
promotion of research and technological development.  n21

    Two types of trade-offs may thus surface in the application of EC
competition law. First, a trade-off between competition in the static sense and
dynamic competition, and second, a trade-off between competition and some of the
other objectives of the Treaty. Two principles laid out in the provisions of the
Treaty related to competition among undertakings allow partial considerations of
these trade-offs. First, there is an exemption mechanism that gives a certain
amount of flexibility in the enforcement  [*530]  of competition law by allowing
some anti-competitive practices that have redeeming values either from the point
of view of competition in the long run or from the point of view of the other
objectives of the Treaty. Second, such exemptions can only be granted in cases
where competition is not eliminated for a substantial part of the products in
question.

    There is no exemption in the case of Article 86, because, by definition, the
anti-competitive abuse by a firm holding a dominant position within the common
market restricts competition in a substantial part of the European market.
However, practices of undertakings which fall under Article 85(1) may be
exempted through Article 85(3) if they "contribute[] to improving the production
or distribution of goods or to promoting technical or economic progress, while
allowing consumers a fair share of the resulting benefit;"  n22 if they do not
impose on the undertakings restrictions that are not indispensable; and if they
do not "afford such undertakings the possibility of eliminating competition in
respect of a substantial part of the products in question."  n23

    Typical examples of such exemptions would include specialization agreements,
research cooperation, or joint ventures through which two or more undertakings
combine their capacities and knowledge, when the aim of such arrangements is to
improve the efficiency of the firms involved. Additionally, agreements that
ensure the existence of a new product or service would be exempt. Discussing the
question of the relationship between competition law and industrial policy in
the European Community, Manfred Caspari concluded:



   While the competition rules laid down in the EEC Treaty are applied within
the framework of an overall and active competition policy, considerations which
in a broad sense may be described as industrial policy considerations enter into
a number of decisions. The aim is to create efficient undertakings on markets
that fulfill this function, undertakings which are willing and able to engage in
fair and active competition.  n24


    While the three specific features of European competition  [*531]  law
outlined above are well known and have been discussed frequently in the analysis
of Article 85 and Article 86 decisions, they are also useful for understanding
both the provisions of Article 92, which establish the substantive rules for
aids granted by Member States, and the case law.

    In the Chapter devoted to Rules on Competition, the first paragraph of
Section 3 of Article 92, entitled "Aids Granted by States," provides:



   Save as otherwise provided in this Treaty, any aid granted by a Member State
or through State resources in any form whatsoever which distorts or threatens to
distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of
certain goods shall, in so far as it affects trade between Member States, be
incompatible with the common market.  n25


    The second and third paragraphs of Article 92 detail the exemptions to this
rule. Some state aids, including those having a social character, those that
compensate for damages caused by natural disasters, and those granted to the
economy of certain areas of the Federal Republic of Germany, shall be compatible
with the common market. Others may be considered compatible with the common
market. Of particular interest is paragraph 3 of Article 92, which states:




    The following may be considered to be compatible with the common market:

   (a) aid to promote the economic development of areas where the standard of
living is abnormally low or where there is serious underemployment;

   (b) aid to promote the execution of an important project of common European
interest or to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of a Member State;

   (c) aid to facilitate the development of certain economic activities or of
certain economic areas, where such aid does not adversely affect trading
conditions to an extent contrary to the common interest... ;

   (d) aid to promote culture and heritage conservation where such aid does not
affect trading conditions and competition in the Community to an extent that is
contrary to the common interest; [and]  [*532]

    (e) such other categories of aid as may be specified by decision of the
Council acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission.  n26



   I. STATE AIDS


    Although Article 92 does not define state aids, the definition of such aids
is clear, if wide-ranging. The Court of Justice has stated:



   The concept of aid is ... wider than that of a subsidy because it embraces
not only positive benefits, such as subsidies themselves, but also interventions
which, in various forms, mitigate the charges which are normally included in the
budget of an undertaking and which, without, therefore, being subsidies in the
strict meaning of the word, are similar in character and have the same effect.
n27


    Thus, within the scope of Article 92, state aid can take a variety of forms:
subsidies; preferential rates on loans; cash injections to public enterprises;
deferrals of tax, social security or other payments; sale or rental of land or
property at discounted rates; preferential electricity or natural gas rates;
infra-structural projects benefiting identifiable end users; and others.  n28 In
effect, any intervention by a Member State, i.e., by a state body or through the
direction of the state, which intervention benefits a firm or a group of firms
by increasing the resources they would normally obtain or by decreasing the
costs, including taxes, they would otherwise incur, qualifies as a state aid
irrespective of whether the benefit is conferred in money or in kind.

    The fact that the aid must favor certain undertakings means that Member
State interventions that apply uniformly across the economy cannot be considered
state aids. This does not mean that general economic measures, such as rules of
depreciation applied to capital equipment or charges on employers and employees
to finance social benefits, cannot distort competition, but rather, are covered
by other provisions in the Treaty.  n29  [*533]

    The only real difficulty concerns the case of capital injections into
private or public firms. If the Member State invests in a manner similar to a
private investor, expecting a normal return on its investment, then there is no
state aid. If the Member State invests where a private investor would not have
invested, then there is a state aid. Thus, when private and public investors
inject capital simultaneously and in comparable amounts, it is presumed that
there is no state aid. However, when only the Member State injects capital, the
Commission evaluates whether a private investor would have been likely to invest
given the financial and industrial circumstances of the firm. The hypothetical
private investor is assumed to seek a normal rate of return given a reasonable
delay.

    For example, the Commission's evaluation of a Sicilian regional law
concerning in particular the financing of Sitas, a firm engaged in the hotel
business, noted that this firm



   is continuing to incur losses despite considerable investment by the region
totalling some Lit 270 billion... There are no prospects of a turnaround, as
evidenced by the fact that the management of EMS is seeking to negotiate with
the creditor banks and that liquidation proceedings were commenced but not
completed, chiefly because of a lack of buyers.

    No investor operating in a market economy would inject capital under such
circumstances or take on the losses of a company without a future.  n30

The Commission concluded that "the sums in question must be regarded as state
aid within the meaning of Article 92(1) in so far as they allow a firm with no
economic basis to remain artificially in operation."  n31  [*534]


   II. DISTORTION OF COMPETITION AND EFFECT ON TRADE


    When comparing the first paragraph of Article 92 to the underlying concept
of competition in the Treaty, it is clear that all state aids "distort or
threaten to distort competition."  n32 Indeed, a state aid gives certain firms
an advantage not conferred to their competitors in their own Member State or in
other Member States. In that sense, they are discriminatory and unfair.  n33

    State aids place competitors of the aided undertakings at a disadvantage,
thereby distorting competition. As the second report on state aids notes:



   Not only are enterprises in other Member states put at a competitive
disadvantage by the aid because the aided enterprises are favoured in a way
outside the normal fiscal or social security systems that contribute to the
equilibrium between Member States, but also enterprises not receiving aid in the
same Member State are disadvantaged and pay higher taxes directly or indirectly.
n34

Thus, state aids are treated as per se anti-competitive.  n35 In line with this
reasoning, the Commission's decision on the financing of Sitas states that "the
aid has the effect of distorting competition since it improves the economic
position of the recipients in relation to their competitors who do not receive
such assistance."  n36

    The above decision also illustrates one of the disturbing features of the
Commission's decisions on state aids. In the landmark Philip Morris case,  n37
the Court of Justice ruled that the Commission did not have to determine the
relevant market on which competition is supposed to be distorted before
establishing that an aid distorted competition, as in Article 85 or Article 86
cases.  n38

    An extreme case, which illustrates the dogmatic position of  [*535]  the
Commission on the relationship between state aid and competition, is the
Commission decision on the proposal to award aid to SST-Garngesellschaft mbH,
Thuringen.  n39 According to the Commission, the object of this aid was to cover
the cost of the installation of new facilities for the production of polyester
staple fiber. The entire output of the new plant was to serve as supply for the
company's spinning mill for the production of specialized polyester yarn, which
is not produced elsewhere in the Community.  n40 The Commission then went on to
state:



   The aid in question undoubtedly constitutes aid within the meaning of Article
92(1) of the EC Treaty, as it would allow SST-Garngesellschaft mbH to carry out
the planned investment without having to bear all of the cost. Furthermore, as
there is intra-Community trade in polyester staple ... , the proposed aid would
be likely to distort competition and affect trade among the Member States.  n41

The decision leaves us in the dark as to how the aid would distort competition
because the beneficiary of the state aid will be the sole producer in the
Community of the specialized yarn it intends to manufacture. The only
conceivable cases in which there could be a distortion of competition would be
either if the polyester yarn, which the beneficiary planned to produce, was a
substitute for some of the other polyester staple produced in the Community, or
if there were imports of this yarn. Yet, the Commission indicated that the yarn
is specialized, which seems to suggest that it does not have substitutes, and
did not mention the existence of imports. Thus, it appears that even when there
are no competitors, state aids can be considered to distort competition. In
short, there is a clear possibility of conflicts between the interpretation of
the concept of competition in Article 85 and Article 86 cases and in state aids
cases.

    Finally, a state aid within the meaning of Article 92(1) must "affect[]
trade between the Member States."  n42 One should note that the Commission and
the Court of Justice have given a broad interpretation of the concept of effect
on trade in decisions on state aids, in line with the interpretation of this
concept in Arti [*536]  cle 85 and Article 86 decisions. The Commission and the
Court of Justice consider, for example, that even when state aids are not
specifically designed to stimulate exports or restrain imports, they
nevertheless affect trade if they reinforce the position of an undertaking
vis-a-vis competitors in intra-Community trade.  n43 When the beneficiary of the
state aid exports part of its production, this condition is fulfilled, even if
the exports represent a small part, less than 5%, of its total production,  n44
or if its exports represent a tiny part, less than 0.03%, of intra-EC trade.
n45

    In addition, to appraise the effect of Community trade the Commission not
only takes into account the potential advantage that the beneficiary will enjoy
on exports markets, it also considers the advantage it may derive from the state
aid on its domestic market vis-a-vis foreign importers.

    For example, in its decision concerning the financing of Sitas, the
Commission stated:



   The measures to be regarded as constituting state aid constitute assistance
to firms operating in Sicily. They benefit those firms inasmuch as the
assistance is not provided outside the region... The aid in question ... affects
trade between Member States. Although it is not possible to assess the full
impact of the aid as not all the recipients are known, import and export
statistics . . . reveal that a significant proportion of Sicilian products and
services is exported to other Member States. In addition, trade between Member
States is also affected in cases where the aid favours domestic output and
services to the detriment of imports and the provision of services from other
Member States.  n46

What is remarkable in this and other decisions is that the Commission relies
only on the fact that there is intra-Community trade in the sector in which the
beneficiaries of the aid operate to establish that the aid affects trade between
Member States.

    Furthermore, even in cases in which the state aid is granted  [*537]  to a
firm or a group of firms selling a product for which there is practically no
intra-Community trade, the Commission may consider that trade is affected if
this aid is likely to limit the development of a competing product for which
there are significant exports and imports.  n47

    Thus, state aid of any significance is automatically deemed to meet the
other criteria of paragraph 1 of Article 92 and to be incompatible with the
common market. The Commission does not have to elaborate at length over why in
the particular case at hand the aid could distort competition, what the market
and the affected products are, or whether these particular products as opposed
to other products in the same sector are traded among Member States. The
Commission, however, considers that Article 92(1) does not apply to state aids
grants amounting to less than 50,000 ECU over a three-year period.  n48


   III. EXEMPTIONS


    The main question in state aids decisions, therefore, is whether the aid
qualifies for an exemption or, in other words, whether the state aid fulfills
some other goal of the Treaty. There are two types of automatic exemptions:
Article 92(2) exemptions and various types of discretionary, Article 92(3)
exemptions. The two types of automatic exemptions are: first, state aids that
have a social character, are granted to individual consumers, and are granted
without discrimination regarding the origin of the product;  n49 and second,
state aids that are due to exceptional circumstances requiring solidarity, i.e.,
aids to compensate for the damage caused by national disasters or exceptional
occurrences.  n50

    Other aids may be exempted. Among these are aids to promote the economic
development of severely depressed areas, i.e., areas where the standard of
living is abnormally low or  [*538]  where there is serious unemployment.  n51
Also included are aids to promote the execution of important projects of common
European interest.  n52

    Article 92(3)(a) is designed to exempt state aids that compensate for
handicaps that would normally deter firms from investing in more backward
regions, in which the per capita gross domestic product does not exceed
seventy-five percent of the Community average in purchasing power parities.  n53
As Manfred Caspari stated, "such aid is therefore an expression of efforts to
create greater equality of opportunity between regions. It is in line with the
cohesion requirement ... incorporated into the EEC Treaty."  n54 The granting of
an exemption on the basis of Article 92(3)(a) is, however, subject to two
conditions. First, the aid must concern one of the regions from a Commission
list, which includes the whole of Greece, Ireland, Portugal, the Italian
Mezzogiorno, Northern Ireland, various provinces of Spain, and the overseas
departments of France.  n55 Second, the aid must not lead to the creation of
competition-distorting excess capacity in capital intensive industries.  n56

    State aids to other regions may be exempted, however, under the provisions
of Article 92(3)(c). As far as Article 92(3)(b) is concerned, there are very few
cases of "important projects of common European interest" justifying an
exemption.  n57 Those projects are usually associated with programs such as
ESPRIT,  n58 RACE,  n59 or BRITE  n60 or with situations in which the Community
is confronted by a general threat such as the destruction of the environment.
The Commission stated in its 1991 annual report that Article 92(3)(b) could also
apply to  [*539]  projects that were important both quantitatively and
qualitatively, transnational, and related to the definition of international
standards, thus allowing European industry to benefit from the full advantages
of a single market.  n61 For example, the Commission considered that state aids
granted by the governments of France, the Netherlands, and Italy designed to
encourage research and development for the definition of a European standard for
High Definition Television could be exempted.  n62 If the aid examined relates
to an important project of common European interest, the Commission also
verifies that it does not exceed what is tolerable from a competition policy
point of view.

    One reason for the Commission's narrow interpretation of Articles 92(3)(a)
and 92(3)(b) is that the these provisions do not explicitly condition the
granting of the exemption on whether the aid will not significantly affect
intra-European trade. In the vast majority of cases, the discussion about the
possibility of an exemption is based upon Article 92(3)(c), which concerns aids
that "facilitate the development of certain economic activities or of certain
economic areas, where such aid does not adversely affect trading conditions to
an extent contrary to the common interest."  n63

    It is not easy to summarize the principles underlying the Commission's
reasoning when it applies Article 92(3)(c). Concurrently, one must consider: the
wording of Article 92(3)(c); general principles imbedded in other articles of
the Treaty; a variety of specific rules established by the Commission in
guidelines or frameworks on state aids that are either horizontal, such as the
guidelines dealing with regional aids, aids for research and development, aids
for the restructuring of firms, aids for small and medium-sized enterprises, and
aids for the environment, or sectoral, such as aids for textile and clothing,
synthetic fibers, motor vehicles, shipbuilding, coal and steel, agriculture, and
food processing; and the case law.

    The Commission has enjoyed considerable discretion in interpreting Article
92(3)(c). This situation, however, may change  [*540]  in the future. Leigh
Hancher, Tom Ottervanger, and Piet Jan Slot stated that:



   Up until now the Court has generally been prepared to endorse the
Commission's discretionary powers to assess the compatibility of individual
measures with Article 92(1) as being wide in nature. In only two cases to date
has the Court annulled a Commission Decision on grounds of a manifest error of
fact. Our survey of the Commission's decision making practice suggests that, in
certain cases, the factual evidence presented in support of a decision to allow
a national aid to be granted could well bear closer scrutiny. Once again
parallels may be drawn from the experience gained in the application of Articles
85 and 86. One of the reasons for transferring jurisdiction in appeals against
Commission decisions concerning these Articles to the Court of First Instance
was to improve the administration of justice in the Community by engaging in
more detailed investigation of factual matters. That Court has now developed a
particular expertise in dealing with the economic effects of complex factual
issues ... The transfer of jurisdiction [to the Tribunal, effective August 1993]
to review individual challenges to state aid decisions may be one means of
stimulating a more critical appraisal of Commission state aid policy.  n64


    A necessary, but not sufficient, condition for a state aid to be granted an
exemption under Article 92(3)(c) is that it be in the common interest of the
Community. This concept is not defined in Article 92. Furthermore, the goals of
the Community listed in Article 2 of the Treaty are couched in terms so general
that the Commission has a sufficient flexibility to decide what interferences in
market mechanisms should be legitimized through state aids and to set Community
industrial policy agenda.

    Before analyzing the criteria used by the Commission to determine what is in
the common interest, it should be stressed that the compatibility with the
Treaty must be determined in the context of the Community as a whole and not in
the context of a single Member State. This has several implications. The first
one is to legitimize the fact that Member States are not competent to apply
directly the provisions of the Treaty relating to state aids. Second, it means
that Member States cannot justify the  [*541]  granting of state aids solely on
the basis of the benefits they expect from such aids. For example, a state aid
designed to foster economic development in a depressed region in one Member
State may not be in the interest of the Community if the region cannot be
considered to be economically depressed when compared to all regions in the
Community. Thus, in its Tenth Report on Competition Policy, the Commission
stated:



   State aids are in principle incompatible with the common market. The
discretionary powers of the Commission should only be exercised when the aids
proposed by Member States contribute to the achievement of the Community
objectives and interest set out in Article 92(3). The national interest of a
Member State or the benefits obtained by the recipient of the aid in
contributing to the national interest do not by themselves justify the positive
exercise of the Commission's discretionary powers.  n65

Third, it also means that the Commission has reservations about state aids
granted to multinational firms. Indeed, because multinational firms often
operate on a global level, state aids designed to help them restructure are not
necessarily consistent with what would be in the interest of the Community.

    At the most general level, one can say that the Commission views four types
of aids favorably: aids for small and medium-sized enterprises, aids for
regional development, aids for research and development, and aids for the
environment.

    Regarding aids for small and medium-sized enterprises, the Community
Guidelines on State Aid for Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises states that:
"there can be no doubt that state aids for [small and medium-sized enterprises]
"facilitate the development of certain economic activities or of certain
economic areas.' "  n66 At the same time, the Commission considers that aids to
small and medium-sized enterprises are less disruptive of competition than aids
to larger firms.

    State aids for research and development may also be viewed positively to the
extent that they relate to the aim stated in Article 130f(1) of the Treaty,
which strengthens "the scientific and technological bases of Community industry
and [which encour [*542]  ages] it to become more competitive at international
level."  n67 As the guidelines on research and development make clear, the
Commission views favorably state aids for basic industrial research, but limits
the state aid to fifty percent of the gross cost of the project or program. The
Commission feels, however, that if the research and development is more
thoroughly applied so that its output more easily and rapidly influences a
product market, then there is a greater risk that the state aid will distort
competition. Therefore, the ceiling on the admissible state aid decreases as the
research is increasingly applied. The Commission also considers that simple
improvement of existing facilities does not qualify for an exemption under
Article 92(3)(c).  n68 To qualify for an exemption under Article 92(3)(c), the
investment benefiting from the state aid must lead to the development of new
products or the adoption of new processes.

    State aids for regional development, when applied to regions that suffer
from serious socio-economic disparities with the rest of the Community, are
viewed favorably and monitored by the Commission to achieve the goals of
promoting a "harmonious and balanced development of economic activities"  n69
and "convergence of economic performance"  n70 as set out in Article 2 of the
Treaty. Thus, for example, state aids to investments in central, industrialized
regions, cannot exceed 20% of the total investment, whereas in peripheral, lowly
industrialized regions, they can represent a larger proportion of the
investment.

    Finally, environmental aids, which also relate to the goal of achieving
"growth respecting the environment," set out in Article 2 of the Treaty, are
viewed favorably if they are necessary to help undertakings adapt to laws or
regulations, which impose major new burdens relating to environmental
protection. In this instance, an undertaking can get an Article 92(3)(b)
exemption. If the aid is intended to promote additional efforts going beyond
national standards, then the undertaking may qualify for an Article 92(3)(c)
exemption.

    In sectors facing serious economic difficulties due to international
competition, such as motor vehicles, textiles, shipbuild [*543]  ing, coal and
steel, and where Member States may have a natural and growing inclination to
grant state aids, the Commission has been concerned with limiting such aids. The
aid is limited to projects that improve the efficiency of the industry, allow
the conversion of firms to activities outside the industry, or allow existing
firms to diversify their production towards products that will place them in a
better position on the international markets. Such aids are allowed, however,
only to the extent that they will not worsen the difficulties of similar
industries in other European countries.

    In other sectors, state aids may be allowed if they appear necessary to the
development or maintenance of existing strategic industries. Thus, for example,
the Commission allowed a state aid by the United Kingdom for the restructuring
of the last tin mine in Europe. It also allowed a state aid by the United
Kingdom for the purchase of industrial equipment for off-shore exploration when
this sector was in an early stage of development in Europe. In 1979, however,
the Commission withheld approval of the state aid because by then the sector had
developed, and the promotion of this sector no longer had strategic importance.
Similarly, the Commission may allow state aids to shipyards for the construction
of ships so that they can successfully compete against non-European shipyards.
However, in such cases the state aid must not exceed the amount necessary to
prevent the order from going to a non-European shipyard.

    To qualify for the exemptions of Article 92(3)(c), aids that fit the above
mentioned general criteria must also meet at least six conditions: they must be
transparent; they must be justified by a market failure or an externality; they
must not provide continuous artificial support to non-viable undertakings; they
must not create over-capacities; they must be proportionate to the goal they
seek to achieve; and the restrictions to competition and trade that they entail
must not outweigh the expected benefits at the Community level.

    The transparency requirement is the easiest to understand. To grant an
exemption, the Commission must be in a position to know precisely, both
quantitatively and qualitatively, what the aid is all about. In particular, the
Commission needs to know who the beneficiaries are, what the mechanism of the
aid is, what the goal of the aid is, and what the importance of the aid is, both
in absolute terms and in proportion to the total investment.  [*544]

    The second condition is more substantive. Exemptions may be invoked only
when the Commission is satisfied that without the aid, market forces alone would
be insufficient to guide the recipients towards the behavior that the state aid
is supposed to encourage and that must be consistent with the other conditions.
Thus, on the one hand, the Commission may grant an Article 92(3)(c) exemption
for regional aids in certain lagging areas, such as those in which the GDP per
inhabitant is in the long run at least fifteen percent lower than the national
average, or where the unemployment rate is at least ten percent greater than the
national unemployment rate. The Commission must be convinced that without such
aids, these areas would not be able to attract sufficient private investment to
reduce their deficit. Alternatively, the Commission will refuse to grant an
exemption for a state aid to a firm if it is convinced that the proposed
investment would be profitable without the aid. The Commission will deny the
exemption even if the investment can be considered to have a Community interest,
i.e., if it contributes to the development of the firm's region or sector.  n71

    State aids designed simply to facilitate the modernization of existing
capacities of an unprofitable firm in a sector characterized by existing or
potential excess capacity will not be granted an exemption on the basis of
Article 92(3)(c) for various reasons. First, the modernization of a firm is, in
itself, considered by the Commission to be part of what profit maximizing
private investors would normally do, and therefore unrelated to a market failure
or an externality. Second, the expansion of capacities or the modernization of a
firm in a structurally depressed sector is not likely to alleviate the
disequilibrium between supply and demand at the Community level, as would a
decrease in capacity or a restructuring of the firm allowing it to redirect some
or all of its resources to another sector or to a different market. The
profitability of the beneficiary would likely improve from such aids. The burden
between supply and demand associated with the structural disequilibrium at the
Community level, however, would shift to competing firms of other Member States.
Thus, allowing a Member State to grant such aids would eventually give an
incentive to other Member States to retaliate by granting aids  [*545]  for the
modernization of their firms. Consequently, this succession of aid would not
restore the profitability of the sector.

    The third condition is that state aids must not provide artificial support
to unprofitable undertakings. The Commission has repeatedly stated that state
aids should not be used to prevent the disappearance of non-viable firms. For
example, the Commission, in its decision concerning financing for Sitas, stated:



   With regard to the exceptions provided for in Article 92(3)(c) in respect of
aid to facilitate the development of certain economic activities where such aid
does not adversely affect trading conditions to an extent contrary to the common
interest, the aid is not tied to any restructuring plan ensuring restoration of
the firm's viability. It is therefore an operating aid which preserves the
status quo by preventing normal market forces from taking effect. The aid
cannot, therefore, be considered compatible with the common market.  n72


    Fourth, the Commission considers that state aids in sectors characterized by
existing or potential excess capacities can be tolerated if, and only if, they
contribute to a restructuring of the beneficiaries and a decrease of existing
capacities, over and beyond the reductions that would be spontaneously forced on
the beneficiaries by the normal working of the market. It must be clear that the
restructuring will enable the firm to become profitable without further
injection of state aid.

    This principle is embedded in various sectoral guidelines or codes. For
example, investment aids in the steel sector, characterized by severe excess
capacity, cannot, in general, qualify for an exemption under Article 92(3)(c).
There is a temporary exemption for Greece, Portugal, and the German landers
located in the former German Democratic Republic. To qualify for this exemption,
capacity reductions must accompany the aids. Similarly, in the synthetic fiber
industry, aids for investments relating to the production and texturization of
polyester, polyamide, acrylic, and polypropylene fibers can qualify for an
exemption only if they are combined with a capacity reduction of the
beneficiary. In the automobile sector state aids for unprofitable manufacturers
of passenger vehicles must, among other requirements, include a restructuring
plan and a reduction in capacity for the beneficiary. Beyond the requirements
set in certain  [*546]  sectoral regulations on state aids, other regulations on
aids, for rescue aids, or for environmental investments, specify that such aids
must be accompanied by reductions of capacity of the beneficiary.

    The general concern of the Commission with overcapacity raises several
questions. If interpreted strictly, it implies that a new entrant in the sectors
or in the markets considered to be having overcapacity cannot benefit from a
state aid, because by definition it cannot reduce its existing capacity, whereas
established firms could benefit from such an aid in certain circumstances, i.e.,
if they met the other conditions set by the Commission.

    The SST-Garngesellschaft mbH decision  n73 illustrates this consideration.
The object of this aid was to cover the cost of the installation of new
facilities for the production of polyester staple fiber. The entire output of
the new plant was to supply the company's spinning mill for the production of
specialized polyester yarn that is not produced elsewhere in the Community.
Having found that this aid violated Article 92(1), the Commission stated:



   Since 1977, aid to the synthetic fibre industry has been subject to
constraints. The current version of the Code relates to the production and
texturization of four fibers - polyester, polyamide, acrylic and polypropylene -
irrespective of the end-use, and to their polymerization where integrated with
fibre production in terms of the machinery involved. The Code states clearly
that authorization of proposals to grant aid to synthetic fibre producers is
conditional on a significant reduction in the production capacity of the
prospective beneficiary. SST itself does not currently produce any synthetic
fibers so that a capacity reduction is not possible. The aid does not meet the
requirements of the Code.  n74


    Perhaps because it sensed that this reasoning led to an economically
questionable result in the case at hand, the Commission found a way to authorize
it. Despite the fact that the region did not meet the code requirements, the
Commission granted the aid because the region could be classified for regional
aid by virtue of Article 92(3)(a), and because the investment consid [*547]
ered was part of a broader plan to restructure the German Democratic Republic's
synthetic fiber industry. The Commission stated that granting the aid would
result in a reduction in capacity of twenty-five percent, similar to the
reduction in capacity in the rest of the Community since 1978.

    The tougher standards used by the Commission to exempt a state aid when
there is actual or potential "excess capacity" in the sector, together with the
Commission's discretion as to the definition of the market or sector examined,
can also lead to striking differences in the standards applied by the Commission
in its decisions.  n75

    In this respect, it is interesting to compare two decisions: the Commission
decision on a state aid granted to Opel for an investment in one of the landers
of the former German Democratic Republic,  n76 and its decision on the state aid
granted to Ford and Volkswagen by the Portuguese government for the creation of
a new plant in the Setubal peninsula.  n77 In both cases, the aid was for an
investment in an automobile plant in an economically depressed area. In the
first case, the Commission did not go into details about market segmentation and
found that there was overcapacity in the automobile industry. Although it
recognized that Opel/GM needed to increase its capacity because it fully
utilized its existing capacity, the Commission concluded that the aided
investment would increase overcapacity in the sector. In the second case, when
it considered the aid granted for the creation by Ford and Volkswagen of a
manufacturing plant of monospace cars in Portugal, the Commission considered
that there was a separate market for monospace passengers cars. In a related
Article 85 decision, the Commission acknowledged the fact that there was some
degree of substitutability between monospace cars and other passenger cars, and
that there was no overcapacity for this type of cars.  n78

    In the first case, the Commission required that the aid be  [*548]  limited
to the amount or the intensity strictly necessary to compensate for the extra
costs incurred by Opel/GM due to the location of its investment. This decision
concluded that the aid would create overcapacity, which is far from obvious
because Opel needed to increase its capacity, and therefore, would probably have
gone ahead with the investment even if the Commission had decided to prohibit
the aid, although possibly in a less economically depressed area. In the second
case, the Commission used a somewhat arbitrary definition of the market to find
that the aid would not create overcapacity. The Commission, adopting a more
lenient approach, stated that the aid, which covered the extra cost faced by the
investors due to the location of their investment and an additional financial
incentive to attract investments in the region, could be exempted.

    The concept of overcapacity, as used by the Commission, is not always
economically relevant. For example, the Commission frequently refers to the need
to increase the rate of utilization of existing capacities to make European
industry more competitive and uses capacity utilization ratios to determine
whether or not excess capacity has increased or decreased in a particular
sector. Capacity utilization is calculated by the ratio of actual sales by the
European manufacturers to their total capacity. Overcapacity is calculated by
the ratio of total European demand for a product at a competitive price, whether
this demand was met by domestic producers or importers, to total capacity by
European manufacturers. Except under strong assumptions, for example, no imports
and perfect competition among the European manufacturers, these two ratios are
unrelated. Indeed the value of capacity utilization ratios, as opposed to excess
capacity ratios, is heavily dependent on the market strategy of the
manufacturers.

    Reliance on the rate of capacity utilization, to assess the propriety of a
state aid, can be extremely misleading from the point of view of what an outside
observer could consider to be sound economic reasoning. If total capacity is
equal to total demand, in which case there is no excess capacity, but forty
percent of the demand is satisfied by more efficient non-European importers, who
have developed a new technology not present in Europe, then capacity utilization
in the industry will be only sixty percent. It is likely that price competition
from the efficient non-European competitors will force the market price below
the cost of  [*549]  the non-efficient domestic producers, so that they will
incur losses. The requirement that a state aid for an investment, such as one
designed to introduce a technological innovation in the production process, to
improve the efficiency of the sector, be accompanied by a reduction in the
production capacity of the beneficiary clearly favors the importers because it
reduces the scope of competition from the new efficient European manufacturer.

    Even in cases where there are no significant non-European imports, the
concern of the Commission with excess capacity can lead to questionable results
from the point of view of competition. If, for example, the excess capacity, as
measured by the Commission, is due to weak competition, the requirement that the
state aid, designed to encourage the introduction of a technological innovation,
be accompanied by a reduction in the capacity of the beneficiary may
unnecessarily slow down the adjustment of the sector and stifle competition.

    In the decisions of the Commission on state aids, competition in the
relevant sector is always, implicitly, assumed to be working satisfactorily, or
to be excessive, even though there is practically no analysis of the actual
intensity of competition. Therefore, the creation of excess capacity through
state aids to investments is never considered by the Commission to enhance
competition; it is only considered to distort fair competition. However, there
is a growing body of economic literature on the impact of excess capacity and
the distribution of such excess capacity among firms, as well as competition in
oligopolies. This literature suggests, among other things, that an asymmetrical
distribution of excess capacity may, in certain cases, enhance competition.
Thus, it is possible that some state aids to investment may have the dual effect
of distorting fair competition and contributing to the creation of excess
capacity, thereby increasing competition in the marketplace.

    The final condition set by the Commission for granting an exemption to a
state aid is that it must be proportionate to the problem that it is designed to
resolve. This will keep distortion to competition at a minimum and will not
affect trading to an extent contrary to the common market.

    Whenever the Commission considers state aid for which one of the sectoral or
horizontal Codes applies, it verifies that  [*550]  the aid falls within the
limit set in the relevant Code. For example, in the case of state aids for
research and development, state aids cannot cover more than fifty percent of the
gross cost of a project for basic industrial research or twenty-five percent of
the cost of a project for applied research and development. Similarly, to
benefit from an exemption under Article 92(3)(c), regional aids designed to
facilitate the development of certain economic areas cannot amount to more than
thirty percent of the investment. Under the Code for state aids to shipbuilding,
operating aids for the production of large vessels must be below nine percent of
the cost of the vessel, whereas for vessels costing less than ten million ECU,
the maximum level of state aid is 4.5%. The maximum levels of state aids for
small and medium-sized firms are usually larger than the maximum for larger
firms.

    In order to benefit from the exemption of Article 92(3)(c), however, the
state aid must also be strictly necessary to correct the problem that justifies
the exemption. An example is the Commission's decision concerning aid to be
provided by the Irish government for the restructuring of the Aer Lingus group,
which was facing a serious financial crisis.  n79 The Commission first stated
that "the genuine restructuring of Aer Lingus contributes to the development of
the air transport sector from a Community standpoint."  n80 It then asked itself
whether the amount of the aid was "adequate and proportionate to the aim of
financing the transition and restore the airline's commercial viability."  n81
In assessing that the aid was indeed adequate and proportionate, the Commission
took into account the fact that "the equity injected into Aer lingus will not
[lead] to an overcapitalization of the airline but will simply bring its
financial ratios into more prudent limits, and, therefore, restore the financial
balance."  n82 "The strategy pursued by Aer Lingus in its restructuring plan is
not over-expansionist" because it will not expand its operating fleet or change
the general pattern of its operations, and consequently, does not aim at
increasing its market share.  n83

    Finally, the state aid must not adversely "affect[] trading  [*551]
conditions to an extent contrary to the common interest."  n84 The Commission
does not always make its reasoning explicit, but rather uses its discretionary
power to decide whether or not this condition is met or to impose constraints on
the granting of the aid so that the condition is met. To establish the extent to
which the state aid will affect trading conditions, the Commission takes into
consideration a variety of factors, such as whether: the amount of the aid is
small when compared to the size of the investment, the market shares of the
firms involved are minimal or will decrease, the market is rapidly expanding,
there is little intra-Community trade for the product involved, or that the
investment will be devoted to the production of goods that will be sold outside
the Community.

    In its decision on the aid granted by the United Kingdom to SCA Aylesford,
n85 a manufacturer of newsprint, the Commission concluded that the investment
aid did not adversely affect "trading conditions ... to an extent contrary to
the common interest."  n86 The Commission considered that the investment aid
would result in an increase in the capacity of production of the firm and that
part of the increased production, 100,000 tons or about a third of the increase
in capacity, would be sold in other Member States. Nonetheless, the Commission
determined that the aid was limited and that although the United Kingdom
imported seventy-five percent of its consumption of newsprint, ninety percent of
these imports came from non-Community countries.  n87

    Similarly, in its decision on a state aid from the German government for the
restructuring of Carl Zeiss Jena, Jenoptik, and Jenaer Glaswerk, manufacturers
of optical instruments located in the former German Democratic Republic, the
Commission considered that the very small scale of the activities of the three
firms in the forthcoming years ensured that the aid would not adversely affect
trading conditions to an extent contrary to the common interest.  n88  [*552]

    The Commission decisions, however, do not provide clear criteria to assess
the extent beyond which the effect of trading conditions due to the state aid
will be held to be contrary to the common interest.


   CONCLUSION


    Manfred Caspari, speaking at the 1989 Fordham Corporate Law Institute
conference, remarked that usually lawyers do not take much interest in the
subject of state aids. This, in his opinion, was wrong because "state subsidies
can distort competition more, and can create more harm to competing companies
which do not get such support than anti-competitive behavior caught by antitrust
rules."  n89

    The fact is that this apparent lack of interest for the European state aid
policy is not unique to lawyers. Economists, even those specialized in market
mechanisms and competition, have also been largely silent on the issue. This is
all the more perplexing because there are hundreds of decisions by the
Commission each year that concern state aids. However, this state of affairs
could be explained on the ground that even if the provisions on state aids are
part of the rules of competition in the Treaty and even if the Commission
produces decisions on state aids as it does when it applies Articles 85 and 86,
these two sets of decisions have little in common.

    First, as any sizeable aid is considered to threaten or distort competition,
market competition or fair competition, there is no real discussion in the
decisions of the actual consequences of the aids on the relevant markets or
detailed definition of the affected markets. The focus of the decisions on state
aids is therefore very different from the focus of Article 85 or 86 decisions in
which the reasoning used by the Commission to establish that a particular
behavior has restrained competition or to assess the extent to which competition
has been affected is explicit and can be challenged.

    Second, the formal decisions on state aids mostly deal with the possibility
of exemptions for the aids concerned or, in other words, with the potential
contribution of these aids to the common interest, the development of certain
areas or certain eco [*553]  nomic activities, etc. The assessment of the
contribution of state aids to the promotion of such general and sometimes
contradictory goals is, to a large extent, dependent on the policy objectives of
the Commission. The Commission has enjoyed broad discretion in making such
assessments. In many cases, its decisions do not prove that an aid can or cannot
be exempted, but merely state that they do or do not adversely affect trading
conditions to an extent contrary to the common interest on the basis of criteria
that are not explicit and the validity of which could not be challenged until
recently.

    Third, over time, the Commission has defined minimal rules in various
sectoral or horizontal codes. This effort would certainly be welcome if it
contributed to making the decision mechanism more transparent and more
predictable. However, not only do the definitions of the rules seem somewhat
arbitrary, they constitute a maze rather than an organized body of references.
In many cases in which several sets of rules could be applied simultaneously to
the same aid with different results, the Commission will choose the one that
fits the conclusion it wants to reach.

    Thus, one could argue that the relative lack of interest of both lawyers and
economists for state aid decisions comes partly from the fact that they do not
always appear to be grounded on a predictable economic analysis and that the
scope for challenging them is at best limited. Two features that differentiate
them from decisions based on Articles 85 and 86.

    Echoing these concerns, the authors of the most comprehensive review of EC
state aid decisions to date state that



   no one could, for a moment, assume that in an area as highly charged by
political and social considerations as state aids policy that one could expect
the Commission to apply a rigid, formalistic or mechanistic approach to
controlling national state aids. The Treaty itself confers considerable scope
upon it to take into account a wide range of factors in reaching its final
Decisions. It is, therefore, not so surprising that what appears to be an
essentially similar set of facts is capable of yielding quite divergent
Decisions in different cases. Yet one is surely entitled to expect some
consistency of approach, and at the very least that similar emphasis is given to
various factors. One might also expect that especially where guidelines exist
these should be applied, and be seen to be applied,  [*554]  in a consistent
manner... On the basis of the analysis of Commission Decisions undertaken in the
preparation of this study, it cannot be said with any certainty that
expectations as to a consistent approach have been or are always likely to be
met. The relative lack of institutional constraints on the Commission in this
field gives the latter ample scope to draft Decisions in such a way that factual
elements which might suggest inconsistency are simply ignored or are only
referred to in summary fashion.  n90


    It remains to be seen whether the transfer of jurisdiction in appeals
against the Commission decisions on state aid to the Court of First Instance
will help bring about a more transparent and more predictable decision-making
process.

   INTRODUCTION

    A series of spectacular state aid decisions in 1994 has given rise to a
vivid debate about the efficiency and the merits oftheCommission's state aid
control: the recent subsidies toailing steel companies,  n1 airlines,  n2 and
the French group,  [*1213]  Bull,  n3 have triggered the discussions that are
particularly critical in certain Member States and in the Anglo-U.S. print
media. They have even reached learned law reviews and are actively pursued
before the Courts in Luxembourg. Because most of these decisions are sub judice,
it is not appropriate to discuss individual cases. This Article will examine
some structural elements of state aid control and try to raise the level of
understanding for what is undoubtedly one of the most difficult and delicate
tasks of the Commission.

    This Article is not meant to be apologetic. The increasing public debate
about state aids and control through the Commission is healthy and to be
welcomed. The European Council has repeatedly stated that strict state aid
control is an essential element of the efficient functioning of the Internal
Market. Controversial public debates, in both institutionalized democratic fora
and the non-institutionalized media, will contribute to state aid policy as much
as the rapidly growing number of Court decisions, which are a visible expression
of the exponentially increasing applications to the European Courts and the
corresponding judicialization of state aid control.


   I. INSTITUTIONAL CONSIDERATIONS



   A. State Aid Control Is Unique  n4


    The starting point is well known but worth recalling briefly. State aid
control is traditionally unknown to states, whether they are organized as
central states, federations or confederations. State aid control is a unique
feature of the European Union ("EU" or "Union"). It is the experience of the
Union that has inspired the successive GATT subsidy codes and its recent ex
[*1214]  ports of state aid control mechanisms to the European Economic Area and
to neighboring countries, in particular Central and Eastern Europe.

    State aid control in the EU had to be established progressively from
scratch. Neither the authors of the Treaties nor the High Authority of the
European Coal and Steel Community ("ECSC") and the Commission of the European
Economic Community ("EEC") could have recourse to earlier international or
national practice. Even today, the understanding of state aid control is
underdeveloped; compare the wealth of writing on antitrust questions to the
dearth of publications on state aid issues.

    One of the most obvious questions, which should intrigue economists and
lawyers alike, goes to the very essence of state aid control. Why can
federations function without any central monitoring mechanism? Is it the
democratic process that makes state aid control superfluous? Are state subsidies
de facto disciplined by the taxing and spending powers of the federation? Are
there any other mechanisms that fulfill the role that state aid control by the
Commission assumes in the EU?


   B. State Aid Control Is "Constitutional"


    State aid control in the EU is of constitutional nature, both with respect
to substance and procedure. With the exception of common policies, agriculture,
fisheries and transport, coal and steel, and shipbuilding, the Council has not
enacted secondary legislation for state aid control. The compatibility of state
subsidies is examined on the basis of the substantive rules of Article 92 and
according to the procedural provisions of Article 93 of the EC Treaty.  n5
Article 94, which allows the Council to "make any appropriate regulations for
the application of Articles 92 and 93," has remained virgin territory. In this
sense, it is quite different from Article 87, which has been used abundantly for
the implementation of the EC Treaty's antitrust rules.  [*1215]

    At first sight, the lack of secondary legislation enacted under Article 94
is astonishing. Would it not have been useful to refine the procedural
provisions of Article 93, something that is expressly foreseen in Article 94?
Why not introduce a de minimis rule in order to rationalize the state aid
control mechanism of the EC Treaty?

    On reflection and in the light of experience, the absence of Council
regulations and of preceding Commission proposals is perfectly understandable.
During the 1960's, the Council's inability to reach agreement blocked all
attempts to legislate under Article 94. The Commission has since abstained from
making proposals. The Italian Government undertook the last initiative to revive
Article 94 in the first semester of 1991, when it chaired the Council. The
initiative was rejected by at least half of the Member States. Recent
experiences in the steel sector demonstrate that the Council is unable to deal
with state aid issues in a rational manner. Expressions such as "horse trading"
or "hostage taking" come to mind when one wants to qualify the Council's
behavior in state aid cases. The Commission is well advised to continue its
deliberate policy to avoid recourse to Article 94 as long as possible.

    What are the explanations for the few exceptional situations in which the
Council has enacted special rules for state aids? The case of common policies in
agriculture, fisheries and transport is obvious, because state aids are
market-correcting instruments par excellence. It is normal to fund and regulate
them specifically in view of the objectives of these policies. State aid to
shipbuilding are expressly mentioned in Article 92 (3)(c). The authors of the
EEC Treaty acknowledged the particular character of an industry, which is
exposed to world wide competition but cannot be protected by traditional trade
law instruments.  n6 Subsidies for coal and steel should normally not be subject
to specific rules. According to Article 4(c) of the ECSC Treaty, they are
totally prohibited.  n7  [*1216]

    This prohibition, however, proved to be excessive and unenforceable in the
real world. After years of total disregard, it was replaced by successive state
aid codes enacted under Article 95 of the ECSC Treaty which follows closely the
provisions of Articles 92 and 93 of the EC Treaty. While more generous for coal,
n8 which is hardly traded between Member States, the state aid regime for steel
n9 is stricter than the Commission's practice under Article 92 for regional and
restructuring aid in general.  n10 In practice, this has not led to outright
prohibitions but to derogations granted according to Article 95 of the ECSC
Treaty and therefore legally legitimate, but highly unsatisfactory from other
perspectives.


   C. State Aid Control Is a Natural Commission Monopoly


    According to Article 93, state aid control is entrusted to the Commission
and to the Commission alone. The only exception is to be found in Article 93(2),
which allows the Council, acting unanimously, to declare a state aid to be
compatible "if such a decision is justified by exceptional circumstances." This
safeguard clause has been very rarely used, and since the early 1960's, never
outside the agricultural sector.

    As a direct result of the EC Treaty, the Commission's responsibility for
state aid control is fundamentally different from its position in antitrust
matters. Articles 85 and 86 do not establish a Commission monopoly to implement
these prohibitions, but leave the definition of its functions to Council
regulations to be enacted under Article 87. The Council has done so in
Regulation No. 17/62  n11 (and its followers for different modes of transport).
n12 Council Regulation No. 4064/89  n13 has established the Commission's
responsibilities in the field of merger control.

    Antitrust specialists know about the vivid debate whether the Commission's
monopoly to implement Article 85(3) should be maintained or not. It is
remarkable that such a debate is con [*1217]  spicuously absent in the state aid
sector. Nobody has ever contested that the EU needs an arbiter who ensures at
the Union level that state aid rules are respected. Nobody has ever suggested
that this function could be shared with or delegated to Member States, as is
suggested for individual decisions under Article 85(3).


   D. Should State Aid Control Be Entrusted to an Independent European
Competition Office?


    The recent controversies about spectacular state aid decisions have produced
one new idea. State aid control should be entrusted to an independent European
Competition Office. The source of inspiration is obvious. It is the traditional
German request to establish an independent European Cartel Office to decide on
antitrust matters. The model for such a European Cartel Office is the highly
successful and respected Bundeskartellamt in Berlin.

    This Article will not discuss the pros and cons of an independent EC
antitrust agency. Suffice it to say that there are good reasons to promote
actively the idea, even if its realization appears to be premature for the next
couple of years. These reasons have been set forth elsewhere.  n14

    The proposal to entrust state aid control to an independent European
Competition Office, though at first sight similar, is of a totally different
nature. It is also totally unrealistic, and thus not worth serious
consideration.

    What are the reasons for this negative assessment? Antitrust rules are
addressed to enterprises. Since the Second World War they have spread to many
parts of the world. Since the end of the Cold War, they have expanded with
extraordinary speed in Central and Eastern Europe, Asia, and Latin America.
Their implementation is, almost without exception, entrusted to administrative
agencies more or less independent of governments or courts.  n15 The EU is one
of the few exceptions, which might disappear over time.  [*1218]

    As we have seen in the beginning, the situation of state aid control is
totally different. State aid rules are not addressed to enterprises, but to
states. They limit the freedom of governments, even of parliaments, to grant
financial advantages to certain sectors of their economy, irrespective of the
technique that may be used, including tax and social security rebates. State aid
control is therefore a serious and highly sensitive interference with national
sovereignty. It is, as we have explained, unique to the EU.

    It is not realistic to assume that this control will be entrusted to a
non-political expert panel, such as a Cartel or Competition Office. Because of
its very nature, it will remain the responsibility of an essentially political
body, such as the Commission.


   E. Shrinking Margins of Political Discretion


    This statement implies that state aid control requires a wider margin of
political discretion than decisions in antitrust matters. It should be noted,
however, that this margin is not without limits, as it is exercised under the
vigilant eyes of the judges in Luxembourg. Even more important is the fact that
the originally wide margin of discretion is constantly shrinking. Two factors
work to limit discretion. The first factor is the Commission's own decision
making, whether in the form of general statements, such as guidelines,
frameworks, notices, etc., or of individual decisions. The second is the
jurisprudence of the European Courts. Since 1993, the Court of First Instance
has jurisdiction over many state aid cases,  n16 and will examine even more
thoroughly than the Court of Justice the underlying facts and their economic
appreciation by the Commission. It has already been mentioned that applications
against state aid decisions are rapidly increasing in number and in
sophistication. Judicial review is one of the fastest-growing sectors, if not
the fastest-growing, of the Courts' activities in Luxembourg.


   F. Increasing Transparency


    As in the case of the European Cartel Office, the plea for an  [*1219]
independent State Aid Control Agency is motivated at least in part by a
perceived lack of transparency. The situation in the Union, however, is more
transparent than in any other part of the world, as it is the only place in
which all state aid projects are subject to a procedure of prior and systematic
scrutiny. In addition, transparency within the EU will increase further over the
coming years. The reasons are both political and legal. There is growing demand
by Member States for information and explanation of the Commission's decision
making practice with respect to state aids granted by other Member States; this
demand is reinforced by the overall debate on transparency following the
Maastricht Treaty negotiations. Another political factor is the Commission's
determination to pursue its policy of issuing more guidelines, frameworks,
notices, etc. These documents explain in advance how the Commission will react
to certain categories of state aid projects such as regional aid, aid in favor
of research and development, the protection of the environment, small and medium
sized enterprises, employment, etc.

    Legal requirements for increased transparency will be generated by the
Courts in Luxembourg, in particular by the Court of First Instance. Observers of
the Courts will confirm that the recent jurisprudence shows a tendency to align
the procedural rights of private parties in the state aid sector on those which
they enjoy in antitrust matters. This tendency is the procedural expression of a
fundamental shift that has occurred almost imperceptibly over the last years.
Aid granted by a Member State is no longer controlled exclusively or principally
in the interest of other Member States, but also, and perhaps even more so, in
the interest of the competitors of the intended beneficiaries of the aid. The
original macroeconomic approach of the authors of the EEC Treaty is being
supplanted progressively by a microeconomic perspective, similar to that which
has always dominated substantive and procedural antitrust law.


   G. The EU's Interest in Exporting State Aid Control


    Because of the high degree of transparency of state aid control in the EU,
which will continue to increase in the future, the EU has every interest in
advancing the scrutiny of subsidies at the international level. This is true of
both substance and procedure, i.e. monitoring. If such rules do not exist or if
they are not  [*1220]  effectively implemented, non member countries will
benefit gratuitously from the EU's internal control mechanism. Such a situation
is clearly not desirable. It might in the end even jeopardize the correct
functioning of the EU's own state aid control. Contrary to commonly held views
about the risks of subjecting oneself to international rules, the EU has nothing
to lose and can only win in exporting its own state aid discipline to other
parts of the world.

    The EU has successfully done so, through the agreement on the European
Economic Area ("EEA"), the so-called Europe Agreements with Central and Eastern
European Countries ("CEECs"), and the new Subsidy Code agreed during the Uruguay
Round and the most recent Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
("OECD") Shipbuilding Agreement.

    The most ambitious exercise has been the establishment of the EEA through
which all the EU's state aid rules and procedures have been exported en bloc to
those EFTA countries which have joined the EEA. Identical EEA state aid control
rules are implemented by the EFTA Surveillance Authority ("ESA"), the so-called
Second Pillar. At the beginning of this year, ESA had a stock of some 400 state
aid cases, most of which were transferred to the Commission when Austria,
Finland, and Sweden joined the EU and when simultaneously the non-EU part of the
EEA and ESA's central shrunk to Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein.

    A hardly less ambitious operation has been adopted in the Europe Agreements.
The CEECs will respect substantive state aid rules that correspond in principle
to those applicable within the EU in similar situations. They will not, however,
set up among themselves a plurinational control mechanism like ESA. They will
have to ensure the respect of their international obligations towards the EU
through strictly national control mechanisms. Whether such a mechanism can be
implemented effectively remains to be seen. In the light of the EU's own
internal experience, its seems almost impossible. The CEECs, however, have one
powerful incentive to succeed. In implementing correctly the state aid
disciplines of the Europe Agreements, they can avoid protective measures that
the EU might otherwise apply to their exports to the EU. The Europe Agreements
place thus a high premium on self-discipline.  [*1221]

    In the new multilateral agreement on subsidies and countervailing measures
negotiated during the Uruguay Round and to be monitored by the World Trade
Organisation, the EU definition of subsidy was adopted. European Union state aid
rules and procedures have largely gained admittance with respect to both
actionable and non-actionable subsidies, in particular those regarding regional
aid.

    The recent agreement negotiated in the framework of the OECD on normal
competitive conditions in the commercial shipbuilding and repair industry is
another example of the convergence of internal state aid policy with external
trade policy. Lack of an effective commercial defense instrument against unfair
competition on the world market in that sector has obliged the EU for several
decades to pursue a very costly sectoral state aid policy, allowing production
aid for shipbuilding. By sacrificing this policy, which in any case ran contrary
to its general aversion to sectoral aid, the EU obtained, inter alia, the
institution in the same agreement of a code protecting it against injurious
pricing by shipbuilders in the signatory countries.


   H. Strengthening DG IV's Overall Responsibility for State Aid Control


    While there is no realistic prospect of entrusting state aid control in the
EU to an independent European Competition Office, strong arguments plead in
favor of a reorganization of responsibilities within the Commission. Contrary to
antitrust matters, which are all attributed to the Directorate General for
Competition ("DG IV"), state aid control is traditionally divided among of
series of Commission departments. State aids fall within the responsibility of
DG IV, with the exception of agricultural aids examined by the Directorate
General for Agriculture ("DG VI"), transport aids by the Directorate General for
Transport ("DG VII"), fisheries aids by the Directorate General for Fisheries
("DG XIV"), and coal aids by the Directorate General for Energy ("DG XVII"). The
explanation for this division of tasks is probably more historical than logical.

    An argument may be made for combining state aid monitoring with the overall
responsibilities for a given common policy, like agriculture, fisheries, and
transport. This argument, however, is only convincing with respect to state aid
disciplines that are sector-specific and therefore intimately linked to the
particu [*1222]  larities of a common policy. It does not carry weight if and in
so far as horizontal rules are to be applied, such as aid in favor of
disadvantaged regions, research and development, the environment, small and
medium-sized enterprises and, most of all, rescue and restructuring aid. In
particular, rescue and restructuring operations should in the future be
attributed exclusively to DG IV, rather than divided among Commission
departments.

    Concentration in DG IV would guarantee coherence and consistency. It would
also diminish the influence of sectoral considerations. It would strengthen DG
IV's position among Commission departments, a consideration that is worth
bearing in mind if one thinks of the medium-term perspective of its weakening
through the establishment of an independent European Cartel Office for antitrust
matters.


   II. RESCUE AND RESTRUCTURING AIDS


    The recent upsurge of critical comments are not directed against the
day-to-day monitoring of state aids by the Commission. The criticism focuses
almost exclusively on a few spectacular decisions approving large sums of money
injected into certain steel companies, airlines, and the French group Bull.
While attitudes of governments are relatively moderate, protests from
competitors, particularly from the private sectors, are aggressive. Competitors
criticize vociferously the levels of aid, the conditions attached and the
recidivist character of some of the restructuring operations.


   A. The Traditional Conditions for Restructuring Aids


    The Commission's traditional practice with respect to rescue and
restructuring aid is many years old, even if it has only recently been clarified
in guidelines. In July 1994, the Commission adopted general guidelines for
rescuing and restructuring firms in difficulty.  n17 In November 1994, it
supplemented these guidelines with a communication that applies them
specifically to the aviation sector.  n18

    Rescue aids are allowed as a short-term, transitional device  [*1223]
preceding a restructuring operation. They do not merit closer examination in the
context of this Article.

    Restructuring aid is subject to a series of conditions which have been
expressly approved in principle in a recent decision of the Court of Justice.
n19 The most important of these conditions are:



   1) A restructuring plan which restores the long term viability of the
enterprise within a reasonable time scale and on the basis of realistic
assumptions as to its future operating conditions.

   2) Aid should not be higher than strictly necessary to enable restructuring.
Aid beneficiaries will be expected to make a significant contribution to the
restructuring plan. Aid should not provide the enterprise with cash which can be
used for aggressive, marked distorting activities. Aid should not go to finance
new investment (like acquisitions) not required to the restructuring. Aid for
financial restructuring should not unduly reduce the enterprise's financial
charges.

   3) In case of "a structural excess of production capacity in a relevant
market in the European Community served by the recipient, the restructuring plan
must make a contribution, proportionate to the amount of aid received, to the
restructuring of the industry ... by irreversibly reducing or closing capacity.
n20


    A similar counterpart will normally not be required if there is no
structural excess capacity. The aid will be conditioned only by the obligation
not to expand capacity during the implementation of the restructuring plan,
except where essential for restoring viability. Capacity reductions in case of
structural excess of production capacity will be less important if the
restructured enterprise is situated in assisted regions or is a SME.

    While the first and second conditions are obvious, the third is not. It has
given rise to acrimonious debates among governments and industrialists in the
different restructuring rounds, for steel and shipbuilding. Though already
accepted in principle by the Court of Justice in earlier judgments and in
particular in a recent decision,  n21 the amount of capacity reduction will cer
[*1224]  tainly be one of the most vigorously argued issues before the Judges in
Luxembourg. The reason is simple. The discussion about the so-called counterpart
goes to the very essence, the raison d'etre, of state aid control in the EU.
Does state aid control protect only or mainly the interests of Member States? Or
does it protect also and perhaps even primarily the interest of competitors?
Over the years, the emphasis has changed. Originally concerned almost
exclusively with Member States, today state aid control is more and more
understood as protecting competitors against distortions of competition. It is
obvious that the counterpart of a restructuring aid grows in significance and in
importance if it is seen as a contribution not only to the improvement of the
overall structure of the market, but also to the acceptability of the grant to
the competitors. In this perspective, a counterpart is not only required in case
of a "structural excess of production capacity in a relevant market in the
European Community,"  n22 but also in the absence of such a situation. There
remains of course the question what the counterpart should be in such a case.
The answer should be a reduction of market share. A cut in production capacity
might not necessarily be the most appropriate means to achieve this end.


   B. Privatization as a Condition?


    It is remarkable that the Commission's July 1994 guidelines do not mention
one condition that has become very important in the most recent restructuring
operations, i.e., privatization. Privatization as a condition for the approval
of restructuring aid is obviously a delicate issue. The Commission can take note
of the commitment of a Member State to privatize the enterprise to be
restructured. Through the viability condition, such a commitment can even become
a binding element of the Commission's decision.  n23

    Can the Commission require privatization without a prior undertaking by the
Member State? At first sight, the principle of  [*1225]  neutrality  n24 seems
to oppose this idea. The viability criterion, however, may again justify it.
Whatever one may think of the reality of the neutrality principle, special
circumstances will be necessary to insist on such a condition. The most obvious
candidates for privatization requests are recidivists, i.e. public enterprises
that have already benefitted from restructuring aid, but that have to be
supported again by further grants of state aid. In such a case, the Member State
concerned has demonstrated that it is not able to assure viability without the
strong presence of a private partner.

    It is obvious that privatization can diminish the amount of aid necessary
for restructuring. A lower level of aid leads logically to a smaller
counterpart, like a smaller reduction of capacity. Such a smaller reduction of
capacity can be vital for the survival of the enterprise to be restructured, if
bigger cuts would jeopardize its future viability. This is another possible
contribution of privatization to the success of rescue and restructuring
operations.


   C. The "One Time, Last Time" Principle


    Another condition which as attracted considerable attention during the last
months is only mentioned en passant in the July 1994 general guidelines: "Like
rescue aid, aid for restructuring should normally only need to be granted once."
n25 It is, however, discussed in detail in the November 1994 communication on
state aids in the aviation sector. After referring to the Wise Men's (Comite des
Sages) Report of February 1994 which had recommended a clear and genuine "one
time, last time" condition, the Commission declared:



   Some ideas of the Comite, however, cannot be accepted by the Commission. It
is not possible for the Commission to change or disregard the EC Treaty. This
means, in particular, that the condition that the aid is the last one has, of
course, to be interpreted in conformity with Community law. This implies that
such a condition does not prevent a Member State from notifying a further aid to
a company which has already been granted aid. According to the Court of Justice
case law, in such a case the Commission will take all the relevant ele [*1226]
ments into account. An important element in the Commission's assessment will be
the fact that the company has already been granted State aid. Therefore, the
Commission will not allow further aid unless under exceptional circumstances
unforeseeable and external to the company.  n26


    The practical importance of this statement is obvious. It has been
demonstrated by the prospect of a new rescue and restructuring operation for the
Spanish airline Iberia  n27 and by the public controversies between the
Commissioner for Transport in 1993-94, Marcelino Oreja, and the Commissioner for
Competition, Karel Van Miert.

    It is not our intention to analyze the precise meaning and the legal merit
of the different elements of the Commission's statement. Only one aspect should
be highlighted in the context of this Article. The "one time, last time"
principle is relatively new. It has found its most solid expression in the
December 1993 conclusions of the Council  n28 giving its assent to the recent
restructuring aids in the steel industry. At the request of the Council, all
Commission decisions authorizing restructuring aid to certain steel companies
are subject to the condition that the Member State concerned "shall not request
any further derogation under Article 95 ... should a return to viability not be
achieved by [the end of the restructuring period]." The principle is also to be
found by the new multilateral agreement on subsidies and countervailing measures
negotiated during the Uruguay Round. Article 5 of the agreement enjoins members
not to cause "serious prejudice to the interests of another member." Article 6
specifies that serious prejudice shall be deemed to exist in the case of
subsidies to cover operating losses sustained by an enterprise "other than
one-time measures which are non-recurrent and cannot be repeated for that
enterprise."  n29

    Compared with these texts, the Commission's statement in the November
Communication on state aids in the aviation sector seems weaker, as it opens the
door for second-time aid in  [*1227]  case of exceptional circumstances
unforeseeable and external to the company. Much depends, however, on the
interpretation and practical implementation of this proviso. It would express a
common sense principle if it were applied only to real cas de force majeure
situations, like the Gulf War. It would, however, go much further if the
deterioration of the value of a currency were qualified as unforeseeable.
Currency fluctuations are normal and have to be taken into account by economic
operators. The Commission should allow only real cas de force majeure
exceptions. If it acted otherwise, it would de facto destroy the "one time, last
time" principle in the aviation sector.

    Whatever happens with respect to aviation, the overall trend of state aid
monitoring has become tighter. This is largely attributable to Karel van Miert,
the Commissioner responsible for transport when Sabena, the leading case, was
decided  n30 and who defended the Commission's position on steel aids in the
Council during the last steel crisis.


   D. Must There Always Be a "One Time"?


    The "one time, last time" principle leads to a more fundamental
consideration. Why should there be a "one time?" Could the Commission simply
refuse the authorization of restructuring aid, even if all normal conditions for
such an authorization, namely restructuring plan leading to viability,
counterpart, aid limited to the strict minimum needed for restructuring, etc.,
are met?

    In order to be perfectly clear, it must be emphasized that the question does
not address the situation in which an enterprise cannot be made viable (taking
into account the counterpart that is required to compensate the amount of aid
necessary for restructuring). In such a situation, the Commission will not
authorize the aid.

    Our question is based on another hypothesis. The ailing enterprise can be
made viable; the necessary counterpart can be provided. Might the Commission
nevertheless say no?

    From a strictly legal point of view, the answer is affirmative. The
Commission is entitled to refuse the authorization. Article 92 does not declare
that restructuring aids "shall be compatible  [*1228]  with the common market."
n31 Restructuring aids have to be justified under Article 92(3) according to
which certain aids "may be considered to be compatible with the common market."
The vast majority of these aids can only be approved under Article 92(3)(c),
which provides for authorization of "aid to facilitate the development of
certain economic activities ... where such aid does not adversely affect trading
conditions to an extent contrary to the common interest."  n32 The Commission
could declare that restructuring aid in a certain sector does affect trading
conditions to an extent contrary to the common interest, in view of the
particular economic situation in the sector.

    It is remarkable that the Commission has never done so. The explanation is
clearly political. The declaration that restructuring aids in a certain sector
are per se against the common interest would clearly mean an industrial policy
for that sector. The Commission is, however, opposed to sectoral industrial
policy. It is committed to establishing horizontal rules in order to promote the
competitiveness of European industry. The existing practice with respect to
restructuring aids is part of that horizontal framework. It is therefore useful
to maintain it.

    But does this reasoning also apply to those sectors in which the EU has
adopted sectoral policies and in which even the Council has been active as a
legislator? If the existing state aid discipline for Steel (the so-called Steel
Aid Code  n33 ) does not allow a certain type of restructuring operation, why
has the Commission asked the Council for its assent, under Article 95 of the
ECSC Treaty, to derogate from the Code and to authorize these operations
nevertheless? Again, the explanation is not legal, but political. Every Member
State has the right to notify aid, even incompatible with the Code, and ask for
a derogation. The Commission, however, has no legal obligation to follow this
request. It has done so in part because of its general attitude to restructuring
aid under the EC Treaty. It could, however, perfectly well change its mind in
view of the particularities of the steel sector and the ECSC Treaty, in
particular its fundamental prohibition of state aids in Article 4c. To do so,
the Commission would need to avoid the argument that, having asked for deroga
[*1229]  tions for a certain number of enterprises, it would discriminate
against the remaining companies which are in difficulties but have not yet had a
chance to benefit from a restructuring operation. The new policy would therefore
have to be announced sufficiently in advance, allowing for a transitional period
during which restructuring operations eligible for a derogation under the
existing practice would still be entitled to a derogation from the steel aid
code.


   CONCLUSION


    In view of the experience of recent years, the Commission would be well
advised to take that courageous step. Otherwise, it is almost certain to be
confronted with a new wave of restructuring operations in a few years time, as
Martin Bangemann and Karel Van Miert have recently warned on several occasions.
Whether this wave could be resisted in applying the "one time, last time"
principle is doubtful, as it depends on the enterprises to be restructured and
on the interpretation of the principle with respect to the period covered. Why
is it likely that the steel sector will see a new wave of restructuring
operations in case of a serious economic downturn? One of the most important
reasons is the existence of large publicly controlled steel companies. It is our
firm conviction that publicly controlled enterprises face particular
difficulties in highly competitive markets and that they are therefore likely
candidates for repetitive restructuring operations. It remains for another
article, however, to discuss the competitive advantages and disadvantages of
public enterprises or the reality of the neutrality principle of the EC Treaty.

Global Hearing Aids Market Growing at a CAGR of 3.9% Between 2016-2024

BYLINE: Persistence Market Research

LENGTH: 651  words


New York, NY,  November 16, 2016 --(PR.com)-- According to the latest market
report published by Persistence Market Research titled, "Hearing Aids Market:
Global Industry Analysis and Forecast, 2016-2024," the global hearing aids
market was valued at US $7,800.0 Mn in 2015 and is anticipated to register a
CAGR of 3.9% from 2016-2024, to reach US $10.91 Bn by 2024.

Hearing aids are used for the treatment of profound hearing loss. Disabling
hearing loss refers to hearing loss greater than 40 decibels (dB) in the better
hearing ear in adults and a hearing loss greater than 30 dB in the better
hearing ear in children. Hearing loss is one of the six leading global diseases.
Approximately one-third of people over 65 years of age are affected by hearing
loss. The prevalence in this age group is greatest in South Asia, Asia Pacific,
and sub-Saharan Africa. According to the U.S. National Center of Health
Statistics (NCHS), 12 out of every 1,000 Americans suffering from hearing loss
belong to the age group of below 18 years. An increasing prevalence of hearing
loss among the population is likely to boost the demand for hearing aids
globally and further fuel the growth of the global hearing aids market.
Moreover, rapidly increasing usage rates of digital hearing aid technology and
patient awareness levels are expected to drive market growth during the forecast
period (2016 - 2024).

The global hearing aids market is mainly driven by factors such as gradual
increase in disposable income, increase in GDP, and increase in global geriatric
population. However, factors such as poor reimbursement policies and lack of
infrastructure will hinder the growth of the global hearing aids market in the
coming eight years.

The global hearing aids market is segmented on the basis of Product
Behind-The-Ear (BTE) Hearing Aids, Receiver-In-The-Ear (RIE) Hearing Aids,
In-The-Ear (ITE) Hearing Aids, In-The-Canal (ITC) Hearing Aids,
Completely-In-The-Canal (CIC) Hearing Aids; Technology (Conventional Hearing
Aids, Digital Hearing Aids); End User (Audiology Clinics, ENT Clinics, Online
Stores); and Region (North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia Pacific, and
Middle East & Africa). The Behind-The-Ear (BTE) Hearing Aids segment is
estimated to be the highest contributor to the global hearing aids market in
terms of value share by 2016 end, followed by the Receiver-In-The-Ear (RIE)
Hearing Aids segment. These segments are anticipated to register CAGRs of 3.3%
and 3.6% respectively over the forecast period. The Digital Hearing Aids segment
is expected to be the fastest growing and most attractive segment over the
forecast period and is expected to create incremental opportunity of US $2,759.8
Mn between 2016 and 2024. The Audiology Clinics segment is anticipated to
register a CAGR of 3.9% over the forecast period.

On the basis of region, the North America hearing aids market is expected to
account for the highest market value share in the global hearing aids market by
2024 end, followed by the Europe hearing aids market. The Europe hearing aids
market is estimated to account for 28.0% revenue share by the end of 2016.

The report profiles some of the top companies operating in the global hearing
aids market. Key players featured in the report are Sonova, William Demant
Holdings A/S, GN ReSound, Amplifon S.p.A., Cochlear Ltd., Starkey Hearing
Technologies Inc., Widex A/S, and Sivantos Pte. Ltd. Leading market players are
focusing on developing innovative products through robust R&D initiatives to
expand their product portfolio and are adopting advanced technologies to provide
better solutions to patients. Some companies are also entering into strategic
collaborations with other leading market players to develop innovative products
and expand their geographical presence.

Humanitarian agencies need to stop failing their staff on mental health;
UN aid worker Brendan McDonald is petitioning to raise the bar on the woeful
state of humanitarian staff welfare

BYLINE: Brendan McDonald

SECTION: GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT PROFESSIONALS NETWORK

LENGTH: 1000 words


Aid worker casualties are horrific: 2,913 nationals and 544 internationals were
affected by attacks since 2000. Regrettably, there will be more. After my 16
years of aid work it is not remarkable that I know colleagues who have been
killed.

Hidden behind these numbers are the families of aid workers who have been
killed. What happens to them? Many of them disappear from our collective
consciousness. Many aid workers who are harmed, especially nationals and
volunteers, don't have insurance or invalidity coverage. If they do, I doubt it
is adequate.

Related: Aid worker: I was drugged and raped by another humanitarian in South
Sudan

Recently, a colleague approached me with a yellow envelope collecting donations
for a UN contractor who had been killed, leaving behind a wife and children.
Contractors are not insured, hence the envelope. On one hand I was glad that we
were doing something; on the other hand I was stunned. Really? The welfare of a
widow and her children depended, in part, on my generosity, a UN staff member?

Casualties are just part of the problem. What happens to the thousands of aid
workers exposed to the stress of humanitarian work? For every aid worker
casualty, there are many more near misses. And, if we're not exposed directly to
the trauma of conflict, aid workers experience it through our daily work.
Victims transfer this trauma to colleagues. Walls are built; emotions
suppressed.

The Antares Foundation found that 30% of aid workers report symptoms of
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after field assignments. A 2013 study by
UNHCR showed that 47% of staff experienced difficulty sleeping; 57% reported
symptoms of "sadness, unhappiness, or emptiness".

Another study by the Antares Foundation shows that 46% to 80% of national aid
workers experience symptoms of distress. In northern Uganda, over 50% of
national aid workers experienced five or more categories of traumatic events.
Respondents reported symptoms associated with depression, anxiety disorders, and
PTSD.

Related: You need a friend: why peer support is key to surviving humanitarian
work

Studies of soldiers show that post-traumatic stress can be cumulative and
manifests itself years later. Aid workers can experience similar levels of
stress to those of soldiers; without the support some forces provide.

Before I went to Iraq the UN checked my physical health, but not my mental
wellness. Few aid agencies test the mental fitness of their staff; fewer have a
comprehensive approach to wellbeing and senior managers rarely acknowledge the
stress of aid work. We never talk about suicide rates among aid workers.

A colleague told me he felt isolated after being wounded in an attack a few
years ago. There were no messages from senior managers; no acknowledgment of
what he had gone through. Human resources advised him not to tell anyone about
his depression, and to make sure that his medical certificate was from a GP, not
a psychiatrist. Better to be hurt on the outside, where people can see it.

Sadly this story is not an isolated one. Post-traumatic stress and depression
are reality for many aid workers. When I experienced burnout a few years ago, I
did not tell my employer. I felt at the time it would have ended my career; much
better to have leukaemia.

The humanitarian sector has not been entirely idle when looking at this issue.
Ten aid agencies signed up to the People in Aid Code, and another 40 stated a
"desire to continuously improve their HR and people management skills". However,
this represents but a fraction of the aid world. Research has found that even
when aid agencies establish wellness mechanisms, many aid workers find the care
inadequate. A real concern of many is the fear that if they report their mental
health issues, it will harm their careers and reputations.

In a recent Irin article about aid worker casualties Ben Parker asks "how do you
honour the sacrifices of aid workers without appearing to value them more than
those they serve?" Maybe the answer is to recognise that people are central to
the achievement of our mission.

Related: Core Humanitarian Standard: do NGOs need another set of standards?

The May 2016 World Humanitarian Summit presents aid agencies with a unique
opportunity to recognise that investing in their staff will reshape aid. I am
petitioning the summit, calling on the UN to prioritise staff wellbeing in five
ways:

1. Invest systematically in caring for the physical, mental and psychological
welfare of their staff. 2. Establish a mechanism to ensure all aid workers have
access to adequate support in the event of illness or injury, particularly for
national aid workers. 3. Support the Core Humanitarian Standard. 4. Support the
establishment of a Global Humanitarian Association to advocate for the rights of
aid workers and their families globally. 5. Establish a mechanism for tracking
the well being of current and former aid workers, including contractors and
volunteers and national staff.

Improving the wellness of aid workers is a pressing task. No matter what aid
commitments emerge from the World Humanitarian Summit, aid workers cannot serve
well unless we are well.

Humanitarian agencies need to stop failing their staff on mental health;
UN aid worker Brendan McDonald is petitioning to raise the bar on the woeful
state of humanitarian staff welfare

BYLINE: Brendan McDonald

Aid worker casualties are horrific: 2,913 nationals and 544 internationals were
affected by attacks since 2000. Regrettably, there will be more. After my 16
years of aid work it is not remarkable that I know colleagues who have been
killed.

Hidden behind these numbers are the families of aid workers who have been
killed. What happens to them? Many of them disappear from our collective
consciousness. Many aid workers who are harmed, especially nationals and
volunteers, don't have insurance or invalidity coverage. If they do, I doubt it
is adequate.

Sudan

Recently, a colleague approached me with a yellow envelope collecting donations
for a UN contractor who had been killed, leaving behind a wife and children.
Contractors are not insured, hence the envelope. On one hand I was glad that we
were doing something; on the other hand I was stunned. Really? The welfare of a
widow and her children depended, in part, on my generosity, a UN staff member?

Casualties are just part of the problem. What happens to the thousands of aid
workers exposed to the stress of humanitarian work? For every aid worker
casualty, there are many more near misses. And, if we're not exposed directly to
the trauma of conflict, aid workers experience it through our daily work.
Victims transfer this trauma to colleagues. Walls are built; emotions
suppressed.

The Antares Foundation found that 30% of aid workers report symptoms of
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after field assignments. A 2013 study by
UNHCR showed that 47% of staff experienced difficulty sleeping; 57% reported
symptoms of "sadness, unhappiness, or emptiness".

Another study by the Antares Foundation shows that 46% to 80% of national aid
workers experience symptoms of distress. In northern Uganda, over 50% of
national aid workers experienced five or more categories of traumatic events.
Respondents reported symptoms associated with depression, anxiety disorders, and
PTSD.

work

Studies of soldiers show that post-traumatic stress can be cumulative and
manifests itself years later. Aid workers can experience similar levels of
stress to those of soldiers; without the support some forces provide.

Before I went to Iraq the UN checked my physical health, but not my mental
wellness. Few aid agencies test the mental fitness of their staff; fewer have a
comprehensive approach to wellbeing and senior managers rarely acknowledge the
stress of aid work. We never talk about suicide rates among aid workers.

A colleague told me he felt isolated after being wounded in an attack a few
years ago. There were no messages from senior managers; no acknowledgment of
what he had gone through. Human resources advised him not to tell anyone about
his depression, and to make sure that his medical certificate was from a GP, not
a psychiatrist. Better to be hurt on the outside, where people can see it.

Sadly this story is not an isolated one. Post-traumatic stress and depression
are reality for many aid workers. When I experienced burnout a few years ago, I
did not tell my employer. I felt at the time it would have ended my career; much
better to have leukaemia.

The humanitarian sector has not been entirely idle when looking at this issue.
Ten aid agencies signed up to the People in Aid Code, and another 40 stated a
"desire to continuously improve their HR and people management skills". However,
this represents but a fraction of the aid world. Research has found that even
when aid agencies establish wellness mechanisms, many aid workers find the care
inadequate. A real concern of many is the fear that if they report their mental
health issues, it will harm their careers and reputations.

In a recent Irin article about aid worker casualties Ben Parker asks "how do you
honour the sacrifices of aid workers without appearing to value them more than
those they serve?" Maybe the answer is to recognise that people are central to
the achievement of our mission.

Related: Core Humanitarian Standard: do NGOs need another set of standards?

The May 2016 World Humanitarian Summit presents aid agencies with a unique
opportunity to recognise that investing in their staff will reshape aid. I am
petitioning the summit, calling on the UN to prioritise staff wellbeing in five
ways:

1. Invest systematically in caring for the physical, mental and psychological
welfare of their staff. 2. Establish a mechanism to ensure all aid workers have
access to adequate support in the event of illness or injury, particularly for
national aid workers. 3. Support the Core Humanitarian Standard. 4. Support the
establishment of a Global Humanitarian Association to advocate for the rights of
aid workers and their families globally. 5. Establish a mechanism for tracking
the well being of current and former aid workers, including contractors and
volunteers and national staff.

Improving the wellness of aid workers is a pressing task. No matter what aid
commitments emerge from the World Humanitarian Summit, aid workers cannot serve
well unless we are well.

You can help get HIV/Aids to zero Celebrate World Aids Day

SECTION: WORKPLACE; Pg. 6

LENGTH: 1014 words


Those who have a calling to help others should not hesitate to get a good
qualification that enables them to take HIV/Aids to zero - that is "Zero new HIV
infections; zero discrimination; and zero Aids-related deaths".

The theme of today's World Aids Day is Getting to Zero. After 30 years of the
global fight against HIV/Aids, this year the global community has committed to
focusing on achieving the three zero targets regarding new infections,
discrimination and Aids-related deaths.

A report by the Joint UN Programme on HIV/Aids (UNaids), released recently,
shows that 2011 was a game-changing year for the Aids response with
unprecedented progress in science, political leadership and results. The report
also shows that new HIV infections and Aids-related deaths have fallen to the
lowest levels since the peak of the epidemic. New HIV infections were reduced by
21 percent since 1997 and deaths from Aids-related illnesses decreased by 21
percent since 2005.

Globally there were an estimated 34 million people living with HIV in 2010.
People living with HIV are living longer and Aids-related deaths are declining
due to antiretroviral therapy. In sub-Saharan Africa, the number of new HIV
infections has dropped by more than 26 percent from the height of the epidemic
in 1997, led by a one- third drop in South Africa, the country with the largest
number of new HIV infections in the world. However, in order to meet the
challenge of Getting to Zero, the global community must work together to achieve
universal access to HIV prevention, treatment and care. And herein lies the
opportunity to not only make a difference in your community, but also to earn a
good living.

"There's still lots of work for those working in the field of HIV/Aids,"
explains Amalia Bene of Boston City Campus and Business College. "In the
prevention, treatment and care of the disease, we require medical and nursing
professionals as well as support staff such as aids counsellors.

"If you have a passion for humanitarian work, but don't have an inclination for
the medical side of things, you can consider HIV/Aids counselling as a possible
career."

Aids counsellors play a vital role in every sphere of life, in society and in
the workplace. They disseminate the correct information about the disease and
its treatment and provide much needed support to those affected.

According to Bene, there are various part-time, full-time and self-employment
opportunities for Aids counsellors.

Companies with large workforces often employ qualified Aids counsellors on a
permanent basis to deal with their workforces' emotional and practical issues
related to the disease. In terms of self-employment, qualified Aids counsellors
can opt to offer their Aids expertise on a consulting basis to organisations
involved in curbing HIV/Aids. There are also those who do Aids counselling as a
free social service or part-time.

"To get started in the field of Aids counselling, however, you need to obtain a
recognised qualification," Bene points out. "You also need to be compassionate
and love dealing directly with people for most of your working day."

Boston City Campus and Business College offers an HIV/Aids counselling and
management NQF5 qualification both as a part- or full-time study course. The
one-year course was developed by a multidisciplinary team of experts comprising
respected medical practitioners working in the field of HIV/Aids, clinical and
counselling psychologists, counsellors, HIV/Aids educationalists as well as
sexologists and other role players.

The course is holistic in its approach, focusing on topics that include
conventional prevention, care and support for the infected and affected,
nutrition, counselling, community networking and policy development.

The course is supported by the Health Department as well as endorsed by the SA
Society of Sexuality Educators. Boston updates the course on a regular basis to
take in the latest developments in the field.

A matric certificate is the minimum requirement for those wanting to enrol for
the Boston Aids counselling course, which is an NQF level 5 course (on the same
level as the first year of a degree). Accredited by the CHE, this qualification
can also provide entry to degree courses for those who do not receive degree
access on their matric certificates. "Gaining a qualification that skills you
for the workplace is a better option than redoing other courses for those who
wish to gain degree access", says Bene.

The course consists of seven compulsory modules that can be done either via
correspondence or by attending classes at any of the 48 Boston branches
countrywide. Learners may register for this qualification at any time as there
is no closing date applicable.

qualification offered by Boston City Campus and Business College, contact 011

World Aids Day, celebrated on December 1 each year, has become one of the most
recognised international health days and a key opportunity to raise awareness,
commemorate those who have passed on and celebrate victories such as increased
access to treatment and prevention services. You can contribute to the day by:

lWearing a red ribbon - to demonstrate care and concern about HIV and Aids, and
to remind others of the need for their support and commitment.

lParticipating in an event - there are hundreds of activities taking place,
including rt shows, marches and religious services. If you can't find anything
in your area, organise an event yourself.

lTalking to your children - regardless of their age, talk to your children about
HIV/Aids.

Children are the future and they need to know that, as stated by the UN General
Assembly on June 10, "HIV and Aids constitute a global emergency, pose one of
the most formidable challenges to the development, progress and stability of
ourâ[#x20ac]¦societies and the world at large and require an
exceptionalâ[#x20ac]¦ global response that takes into account that the spread of
HIV is often a consequence and cause of poverty".

Article urges Pakistan to seek trade ties with US rather than aid

LENGTH: 1044 words


Text of article by Jamil Nasir headlined "Trade, not aid" published by Pakistani
newspaper The News website on 10 October

"I do not want aid, I want trade. Aid cannot transform society" - Mr Yoweri
Museveni, the President of Uganda, is reported to have told US president Bush
during his meeting in 2003. Now, a similar demand has emanated from the head of
state of another developing country and this time it is Pakistan. "When Pakistan
seeks support, we look for trade that will make us sustainable, not aid that
will bind us in transactional ties," the president of Pakistan wrote in an
article recently published in the Washington Post.

The common thread in the demand for trade not aid from the heads of two states
separated by geography, culture and history at least confirms one thing -
developing countries are disillusioned with the aid strategy as it stands today.
The aid strategy of development has not satisfactorily delivered as it failed to
lift the teeming millions out of the vicious circle of poverty and
underdevelopment. However, it may be remembered that the disenchantment with aid
as a development strategy is as old as the phenomenon of aid itself and lot of
controversy clouds the motivation, effectiveness and impact of aid on growth.

The idea of aid was initially conceived as a moral duty that the rich countries
owed to the poor countries due to a common sense of humanity. Economists like
Gunnar Myrdal and Rosenstein-Rodan thought of an aid model as progressive
taxation and transfer payments that transcended the national boundaries. In
order to operationalise the idea of aid as progressive taxation, some kind of
rate or quantum was required as is the case with taxes. Some proposed that the
developed countries should transfer one percent of their GDP to the poor
countries.

But the idea of aid as a moral duty did not gather mass as there was a big
disconnect between the commitments and actual flow of aid. Against this
backdrop, the proponents of aid strategy argued their case on the grounds of
enlightened self-interest. But with the passage of time 'pure self-interest'
replaced the 'enlightened self-interest' in aid. The strings attached with aid
multiplied and aid became an important foreign policy instrument as is evident
from the aid pattern in relation to Pakistan. The level of US aid soared during
its engagement in the region but declined when its foreign policy objectives
warranted so.

The problems with aid were not confined to the supply-side only. On the demand
side the issues of absorptive capacity, corruption, rent-seeking, and
distortions in incentive system etc became associated with the phenomenon of
aid. The reasons of ineffectiveness of aid as a development strategy may be
disputed but one thing is for sure - we cannot name even a single country that
was able to break out of the vicious circle of poverty because of aid as argued
by Dambisa Moyo in his book titled 'Dead Aid'. The only exception we find is
that of the Marshall Plan introduced for the reconstruction of war-ravaged
Western Europe. The reasons were simple: aid was not open-ended (time-bound) and
interventions were strong.

We need to seriously work on the idea of aid not trade. There exists almost a
consensus among economists that trade is a big stimulator of economic growth.
Aid is generally given to the governments and the effectiveness of aid interalia
depends on the efficiency of the public sector and governance. The possibility
of leakages is high if governance is poor. On the contrary, the benefits of
trade preferences are diffused across the private sector. But in order to
translate this strategy into action, market access granted to Pakistani products
in the US and the EU is the basic plank of the aid-not-trade strategy.

Under the umbrella of the WTO, there are two routes for preferential market
access: generalised system of preferences and signing of free trade agreements.
Currently Pakistan is vying for GSP+ status from the EU. The US also grants
concessions to the goods of developing countries under the scheme of generalized
preference schemes. Free trade agreements are the second route of preferential
trading between countries.

We need to work on a three-pronged strategy to push forward trade-not-aid as a
viable strategy for development and economic growth. First, we need to make out
our case for preferential market access to the EU and USA on the grounds of
economic losses of astronomical nature that Pakistan has incurred in the war
against terror. It also needs to be highlighted that enduring peace in Pakistan
is dependent on sustained economic growth in Pakistan and trade opportunities
are of crucial importance in this regard.

Terrorism that has engulfed the region primarily stems from poverty and economic
deprivation and in order to stamp out terrorism from the region, the
international community has an important role to play by promoting economic
development in the region. The impression created by surveys and flawed research
based on dubious methodologies that are bent upon proving that economic
deprivations have no nexus with terrorism need to be dispelled. Commercial
diplomacy needs to be geared towards attaining the status of GSP+ for our goods
in the EU and exploring the possibility of early finalisation of the FTA with
the US.

The second element of our trade-not-aid strategy should be the pleading of our
case through diplomatic channels for early finalisation of legislation regarding
reconstruction opportunities zones promised by the US. Despite the passage of a
considerable amount of time, the promise of ROZs is yet to be realised. The
third element of the strategy is related to improving the supply side. An
exhaustive strategy should be evolved for tackling the energy crisis on a war
footing basis by taking long-term and short-term initiatives.

Besides taking care of the energy crisis, development of human resources,
improving governance, and reinvigorating the institutions responsible for
quality assurance and standardisation are important. It is only through
diversification and sophistication of our export base that the aid-not-trade
strategy can become a workable strategy for economic development.

Aid is just one part of the puzzle to solve poverty

BYLINE: The Canberra Times

SECTION: A; Pg. 11

LENGTH: 838  words


Aid is just one part of the puzzle to solve poverty The budget is a win, but
other avenues need to be explored, ANDREW HEWETT writes I t's a critical time
for Australia's aid program.

We've just seen a welcome increase in the aid budget as the Government moves to
fulfil its promise to help the world's poorest people. The independent review of
aid effectiveness the first in 15 years was completed last month and the
Government is considering its response. Meanwhile, the 2015 deadline for the
Millennium Development Goals that aim to halve the number of people living in
poverty is very near.

One important way of making sure Australia's aid budget is spent effectively is
to ensure that all the government agencies that deliver aid are working towards
the same objectives. The Government's aid program is too often equated only with
AusAID, its overseas aid agency. Yet there are many more arms of government that
can help to lift people out of poverty, whether by delivering aid or policies
that contribute to development.

Next year, about 11per cent of the total aid budget will be spent by government
agencies and departments outside of AusAID.

The amount of aid delivered in these other areas is not insignificant: the
Australian Federal Police, for example, will spend $217.7 million.

In total, the amount of aid delivered by departments other than AusAID will go
up, from $512.2 million to $529.1 million. The involvement of these other
departments can have positive development impacts: a 2008 OECD report on
Australia's aid program found the involvement of other government agencies
provided ways to address problems of regional security, conflict and
instability, and to deliver relief following humanitarian disasters.

However, the involvement of multiple agencies also presents challenges.
Effective coordination is needed to ensure different government departments are
working towards the same objectives. In particular, all departments need to
agree on a single, joint strategy for the countries they are working in.

When this does not occur, there is the risk that Australian aid is scattered and
fragmented, and that impact on poverty is compromised.

Another challenge is to make sure that all departments that are spending aid
dollars are subject to the same disciplines and requirements as AusAID. For
instance, the Department of Defence which in recent years has delivered more
than half of Australia's aid to Afghanistan is not required to report or
independently evaluate the impact of its aid projects.

But finding effective, long-term solutions to poverty is about more than
providing aid to developing countries. Aid is only one part of the development
picture.

Australia's policies on trade, immigration and climate change, for example, can
all impact poorer countries, for better or worse. We need to think beyond aid
and make sure our policies in these areas benefit the poor, rather than
undermine the good work being done by our aid program.

Take our neighbours in the Pacific, who face challenges such as high
unemployment, limited natural resources and a high vulnerability to climate
change.

Australia is the Pacific's main economic partner and leading aid donor
Australian aid to the Pacific is estimated at $1161million next year. But aid is
just one of the many ways that Australia can contribute to their development.

The Government is negotiating a regional trade agreement, PACER- Plus, with New
Zealand and 13 developing Pacific island countries.

Any new agreement should not be a standard free trade agreement, but should
focus on trade facilitation instead. Connecting island producers with consumers
in Australia and New Zealand, and investing in trade-related infrastructure such
as ports and roads, will help promote the region's economic development.

Ensuring there is an effective seasonal migration program for Pacific Islanders
to work in Australia could also provide real benefits for development. Another
practical way of helping poor people in the Pacific would be to reduce the costs
of sending money, or remittances, from Australia back to the Pacific. For every
$100 sent back from Australia, about $20 is sucked up by transaction costs.

These are just some examples of how a broad range of Australia's policies can
contribute positively to development. That's why we need a coordinated,
whole-of- government approach, not just to our aid program, but to all our
activities that affect development.

There's no use giving aid dollars with one hand, when other government policies
or poor coordination with other aid programs mean we are effectively taking it
away with another.

The budget announcement that 0.35per cent of our national wealth will go to
overseas aid next year, plus the ongoing commitment to achieve the target of
0.5per cent by 2015, is good news for the world's poor. Australia's aid program
is already doing a lot of good, but the growth in the aid budget, combined with
the aid review, gives us a chance to do even more.

working towards the same objectives. In particular, all departments need to
agree on a single, joint strategy for the countries they are working in.

When this does not occur, there is the risk that Australian aid is scattered and
fragmented, and that impact on poverty is compromised.

Another challenge is to make sure that all departments that are spending aid
dollars are subject to the same disciplines and requirements as AusAID. For
instance, the Department of Defence which in recent years has delivered more
than half of Australia's aid to Afghanistan is not required to report or
independently evaluate the impact of its aid projects.

But finding effective, long-term solutions to poverty is about more than
providing aid to developing countries. Aid is only one part of the development
picture.

Australia's policies on trade, immigration and climate change, for example, can
all impact poorer countries, for better or worse. We need to think beyond aid
and make sure our policies in these areas benefit the poor, rather than
undermine the good work being done by our aid program.

Take our neighbours in the Pacific, who face challenges such as high
unemployment, limited natural resources and a high vulnerability to climate
change.

Australia is the Pacific's main economic partner and leading aid donor
Australian aid to the Pacific is estimated at $1161million next year. But aid is
just one of the many ways that Australia can contribute to their development.

The Government is negotiating a regional trade agreement, PACER- Plus, with New
Zealand and 13 developing Pacific island countries.

Any new agreement should not be a standard free trade agreement, but should
focus on trade facilitation instead. Connecting island producers with consumers
in Australia and New Zealand, and investing in trade-related infrastructure such
as ports and roads, will help promote the region's economic development.

Ensuring there is an effective seasonal migration program for Pacific Islanders
to work in Australia could also provide real benefits for development. Another
practical way of helping poor people in the Pacific would be to reduce the costs
of sending money, or remittances, from Australia back to the Pacific. For every
$100 sent back from Australia, about $20 is sucked up by transaction costs.

These are just some examples of how a broad range of Australia's policies can
contribute positively to development. That's why we need a coordinated,
whole-of- government approach, not just to our aid program, but to all our
activities that affect development.

There's no use giving aid dollars with one hand, when other government policies
or poor coordination with other aid programs mean we are effectively taking it
away with another.

The budget announcement that 0.35per cent of our national wealth will go to
overseas aid next year, plus the ongoing commitment to achieve the target of
0.5per cent by 2015, is good news for the world's poor. Australia's aid program
is already doing a lot of good, but the growth in the aid budget, combined with
the aid review, gives us a chance to do even more.

Mandela Says AIDS Led to Death of Son;
Health Activists Praise Ex-President's Openness

BYLINE: Craig Timberg, Washington Post Foreign Service

SECTION: A Section; A10

LENGTH: 987 words

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG Jan. 6


Former South African president Nelson Mandela announced Thursday that his son,
Makgatho Mandela, 54, had died that morning of illness related to AIDS, and he
urged other families to speak openly about the toll of a disease that has
ravaged South Africa but is still widely regarded as a taboo topic.

Mandela, though 86 and increasingly frail, has mounted a highly public crusade
against AIDS in the past several years. He called reporters to his suburban home
to make the announcement just hours after Makgatho, a lawyer and father of four,
died at a nearby hospital.

"My son has died of AIDS," Mandela said, ending weeks of speculation that
Makgatho had the disease. He compared his son's illness to his own struggles
with tuberculosis and prostate cancer, and he asked all South Africans to treat
AIDS as an "ordinary" disease rather than a curse for which "people will go to
hell and not to heaven." His only other son died in a car accident in 1969.

Mandela, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for his battle to end apartheid, has
acknowledged doing too little to combat AIDS during his presidency from 1994 to
1999. Since then, however, he has repeatedly urged people to seek testing and
treatment and also promised to be open if any member of his family died because
of AIDS.

"That is the only way of making an ordinary illness ordinary instead of
following those who are not well-informed," he said Thursday. More than 5
million South Africans are infected with the AIDS virus, HIV -- the largest
number of cases in a single country -- and at least 1,000 a day die from
complications of AIDS, according to the United Nations. Like Mandela, other
African leaders have also become increasingly forthright about the need to
combat AIDS despite cultural resistance to public discussions of the disease.

However, the country's current president, Thabo Mbeki, rarely talks about AIDS
and has done little to promote countermeasures. He became embroiled in
controversy several years ago for suggesting that factors other than HIV cause
AIDS. After being reelected in April, he mentioned the disease only in passing
during his inauguration.

A spokesman for the Mandela family, Isaac Amuah, said in a phone interview that
the immediate cause of Makgatho's death was complications from a gallbladder
operation. But he said that AIDS was a contributing factor and that Mandela was
determined to portray the death as resulting from AIDS to demystify the disease.

Mandela's announcement was immediately applauded by AIDS activists and political
leaders in a country where the disease is widely stigmatized. Shame and fear
remain major barriers to treating AIDS, even where effective drugs are
available, according to doctors and researchers.

Death announcements in newspapers routinely refer to someone having suffered
from "a lengthy illness" or pneumonia, instead of disclosing that a person had
AIDS. Victims of AIDS are sometimes said to be cursed by witchcraft, and in some
communities they are shunned.

"For senior people to be brave enough to involve their entire families is the
only way to beat stigma," said Francois Venter, an AIDS physician in
Johannesburg .

African leaders have shown increasing willingness to talk about AIDS and its
toll on their families. A onetime political rival of Mandela's, Mangosuthu
Buthelezi, has spoken publicly about the deaths of two of his children from
AIDS. Zimbabwe's president, Robert Mugabe, revealed an AIDS death in his family.
And Zambia's former president, Kenneth Kaunda, has spoken openly of the death of
his son from an AIDS-related illness in 1986.

The eagerness of Mandela and others to discuss the disease in recent years has
made Mbeki's silence all the more pronounced, although on Thursday Mandela
declined to answer a reporter's question about Mbeki's handling of AIDS.

"There's an enormous contrast," said Zackie Achmat of the Treatment Action
Campaign, South Africa's most prominent AIDS activist group. Of Mbeki's
reluctance to confront the issue, Achmat added, "It adds to the stigma. . . . It
denies a name to the illness of people."

The government's slow response to the spread of HIV-AIDS has sparked widespread
criticism among health experts. Until last year, the public health system did
not provide antiretroviral drugs, which can reverse the deterioration caused by
AIDS. Antiretrovirals are gradually becoming available, but most victims wait to
seek treatment until they are too sick to benefit from them.

Makgatho, whose wife, Zondi, died of pneumonia in 2003, had been receiving
antiretroviral treatment for more than a year, said Amuah, his brother-in-law.
The medicine appeared to restore Makgatho to full health, but he deteriorated
abruptly in the days after a gallbladder operation on Nov. 30. Mandela, who
learned of his son's AIDS diagnosis last year, canceled several public events to
be at his bedside in recent weeks.

"He had other medical problems," Amuah said. But AIDS was "a contributing
factor" in his death. "We cannot deny that."

Makgatho was one of two sons of Mandela and his first wife, Evelyn. The other
son, Madiba Thembekile, died in a car crash in 1969 while his father was in
prison, serving a sentence that would stretch to 27 years for his role as a
leader of the African National Congress.

Mandela is also the father of four daughters, one of whom died as an infant.

Makgatho kept a relatively low profile as the eldest son of an international
icon. Mandela said little about his personal relationship with his son at the
news conference, but in his autobiography, "Long Walk to Freedom," Mandela
speaks affectionately about discussing politics with his son and explaining the
nature of racial oppression.

Also at the news conference was Makgatho's son Mandla, who described his father
as strong and loving. "We were very proud to have a man such as our father to
father us," he said. "He has been the pillar of our strength."

Foreign aid 'industry' sidetracked from central purpose -- the world's poor

BYLINE: Christina Spencer, For the Calgary Herald

SECTION: Ideas; H6

LENGTH: 774 words


You have to hand it to the folks in the foreign aid community: they have very
big dreams.

Recently, a long list of distinguished Canadians signed a letter calling on
Prime Minister Jean Chretien to commit Canada to ''end global poverty.''

OK, sure -- would next Thursday be convenient?

As a rule, I dislike gimmicks such as celebrity letters to politicians,
particularly when they're signed by people you just know have no clue about the
subject matter.

In this case, such foreign-aid luminaries as Margaret Atwood, Jann Arden and
Mary Walsh are among those whom the PM is supposed to take seriously on the
complex issue of how to give the world's poor a decent standard of living.

Can we blame him if he rolls his eyes, crushes the letter into a ball and
attempts an elegant lob into the wastebasket across the room?

But perhaps I am projecting a personal reaction. For I confess to significant
eye-rolling when ''A Call to end Global Poverty'' crossed my desk.

Then I noticed the other names on the letter -- people who do know these issues,
such as Tim Brodhead, co-founder of Inter Pares, Roger Clark of Amnesty
International, Roy Culpeper from the North-South Institute and Betty Plewes,
president of the Canadian Council for International Co-operation.

Plewes's organization, a coalition of more than 100 Canadian groups who work in
development assistance, is behind the letter to Chretien. All right, OK. A fair
hearing is called for.

It turns out these people (both experts and entertainers), have two
straightforward points to make.

First, foreign aid is used most effectively when it is aimed directly at helping
the poorest people. Second, that is not how Canada uses it.

This might surprise taxpayers.

''Canadians think their aid dollars are going to support poor people,'' says
Plewes.

In fact, while helping the poor is a corollary effect of foreign aid, it is
often not the main focus of all those tax- supported, feel-good programs. In
Canada, where foreign aid has done much shrinking until lately, the money
backstops all manner of causes.

There is humanitarian aid, of course (help to the victims of Hurricane Mitch,
for instance) and development aid (building schools or creating women's health
programs). So far, so good.

But then there is the use of aid to flesh out Canada's foreign policy
''peacebuilding'' efforts and Lloyd Axworthy's nebulous ''human security''
agenda.

There is aid for strategic reasons, or to open the doors for business. There is
even aid to countries that have their own aid programs. Says Plewes of all these
goals, ''They overload (Canada's) aid program. I think there is a confusion of
purpose.''

For example, Canadian aid has grown in South American countries where Canada
sees commercial potential. But it has shrunk in places that house the world's
most destitute, such as sub-Saharan Africa. If we are calling this particular
packet of government spending ''aid,'' isn't that what its first priority should
be?

Then there is ''tied aid,'' a concept most Canadians are only dimly familiar
with. Tied aid means that, in order to reap the benefits of Canadian government
help, a country must buy Canadian products. Depending on whose figures you use,
almost two-thirds of Canadian government aid is ''tied. '' Ninety per cent of
food aid is ''tied.'' We'll help you with your famine, but only if you agree to
buy the wheat from Canada.

There are reasons why this is seen as a good idea, and reasons why it is not.
Superficially, we seem to help our own economy by inflicting ''tied'' aid on
other nations. CIDA, which administers 78 per cent of Canada's aid budget,
boasts that foreign aid sustains 36,000 jobs here at home.

The objection, however, is two-fold: tied aid may not in fact give the poor
country the best bang for its (limited) resources. And it dilutes the central
purpose of aid, as if its raison d'etre were to create jobs here. Imagine giving
a homeless Canadian money for shelter, but telling him he must spend it at a
specific address, because we want the building's owner to have a good income.
That's what we do with aid.

Under the guise of helping the less-fortunate abroad, the Canadian government
channels tax dollars to entrepreneurs here. The foreign aid ''industry'' is
alive and well.

There are other things wrong with Canada's aid program but surely a first step
toward improvement is to acknowledge what the main objective is supposed to be:
helping the world's poorest.

Even if it takes Jann Arden's name on a letter to make the point.

The equation: foreign aid = big business;

First the Howard Government abolished the DIFF mixed credit scheme. Then it put
the entire Australian foreign aid program under review. Now the Leader of the
Extra-Parliamentary Opposition, Pauline Hanson, has advocated scrapping the
program.

Should business care? Business should not only care, it should be working
actively and urgently to shape the debate and the outcome.

It seems an unlikely proposition that business enterprises should concern
themselves with a humanitarian proposition such as foreign aid, but there are
six solid reasons for intense corporate interest.

First, foreign aid spending directly generates short-term business for
Australian firms. While the chief aim of aid is to improve living standards for
the impoverished, the contracts to supply the training, advice, food,
construction and other supplies to actually bestow those benefits are often let
to Australian firms.

How often? Last financial year, the chief Australian aid body, Ausaid, let 587
project contracts to 400 companies from Australia and New Zealand with a total
value of $934 million. That's about two-thirds of the total value of the annual
aid budget. It's the equivalent of 1 per cent of Australia's annual exports.

Australian farmers benefit directly too - the average wheat farmer was paid
$1,142 for wheat bought from his property as part of food aid programs last year
and the average rice farmer received $7,105.It may not be an attractive
prospect, but as a matter of hard self-interest there is no other country in the
OECD which services a higher proportion of goods and services from the donor
country, according to Andrew Hewett of Community Aid Abroad.

Second, those aid contracts bring Australian companies into contact with
markets, companies and governments where they might otherwise have grave
difficulty penetrating. Aid projects give them entree and experience. These are
the indirect benefits - and they far outweigh any direct benefits.

For example, when AWA won an aid contract to supply a navigation project in
Nepal, the experience and contacts from that project led directly to another
project, this time in China, worth $60 million, according to the firm's managing
director, John Dougall.

Similarly, Australian aid projects helped get Transfield Construction into Asia
- by the mid-1990s its experience with aid-funded projects led it on to win $100
million worth of non-aid funded business in China, Thailand and Taiwan.

And the vice-president for Asia at the World Bank, Russell Cheetham, relates how
contacts that New Zealand developed with Indonesia through giving aid to its
energy sector paid off recently: "New Zealand negotiated over $1 billion in
commercial investments in energy in Indonesia, the biggest overseas investment
New Zealand has ever made - it's a commercial deal equivalent to over 1,000
years' worth of New Zealand aid to Indonesia.

"It began with a New Zealand aid project and it wasn't difficult for the New
Zealanders to turn that into a business opportunity."

But, third, perhaps the most impressive returns on foreign aid are the ones so
big that they defy measurement - the transformational benefits. Cheetham again:
"In the 1960s, South Korea was totally dependent on foreign aid. It was widely
seen as a basket case.

"It got an enormous amount of international aid, including from Australia,
Japan, the US and the World Bank - and now it is a huge market."

In fact, South Korea is now Australia's second-biggest export market. Cheetham
points out that the same process now seems to be under way in Vietnam.

Fourth, Australian overseas aid is concentrated in Asia, where the world's most
important growth markets are centred and yet where commercial competition
continues to intensify. In this, the aid program reinforces federal policy and
business opportunity.

In the current year, of Australia's total aid of $1.45 billion, $1.11 billion is
going directly into the Asian region, and a proportion of the balance will also
find its way to Asia through the big multi-lateral agencies.

Fifth, other developed countries operate big and powerful aid programs that
effectively support their home-grown companies doing business in Asia. To crimp
the Australian aid budget is to add yet another competitive disadvantage to
those already borne by Australian firms.

Australian firms already carry enough homegrown disadvantages in doing business
in Asia. They do not need the added competitive setback of operating without the
support of an aid program.

For instance, Japan operates the world's biggest foreign aid program, with
annual outlays of $US11 billion and concentrated heavily in Asia. The Government
is advised on how to operate the so-called "trinity" of its overseas
co-operation policies - aid, trade and investment - by an unofficial council
chaired by the president of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

In short, Japan's aid program is an integral part of official policy promoting
national economic engagement, public and corporate, in the region. As a former
top official of the Japanese Ministry of Finance, Mr Tadao Chino, said in 1991:
"The purpose of recycling (the trade surplus into foreign aid) is to stimulate
and assist private capital flows."

And finally, Australian business needs to get active on this subject because the
climate of opinion in Australia seems to be turning against aid. The review of
the program now being conducted for the Federal Government by the former
Woolworths chairman, Paul Simons, is the current vehicle for reconsideration of
the Australian aid program.

It ought to be the vehicle where business can express some enlightened
self-interest.

Time to renew the AIDS fight

BYLINE: By Alina Rastam

SECTION: Pg. 1

LENGTH: 1260 words


AN estimated 20 million people have been infected by HIV - the virus that
causes AIDS - worldwide, four million of whom have died.

And according to the World Health Organisation (WHO), current trends
indicate that Asia will soon replace Sub-Saharan Africa as the region with
highest incidence of infections.

The bulk of HIV infections (an estimated 79 per cent) in Malaysia occurs
in the 20 to 39-year-old age group, the most productive age group - which
means that the workforce of the country is at risk.

World AIDS Day, which falls on Dec 1 every year, is an appropriate time
for us to reflect on such findings. But while we should not underestimate
the devastating effects of the pandemic, it is important that we should
also not give in to despair and apathy.

HIV/AIDS may not be curable, but it is by and large preventable. Thus we
should also focus on strengthening and intensifying our efforts against
it.

The theme chosen by the World Health Organisation for this year's World
AIDS Day is "Shared Rights, Shared Responsibilities."

The Malaysian AIDS Charter, which will be launched today by the
Malaysian AIDS Council and the Malaysian AIDS Foundation, is a major step
towards protecting the rights of people with AIDS.

It is a comprehensive document produced after consultations with
Malaysians from all walks of life affected by the disease or involved with
anti-AIDS initiatives.

What are some of the problem areas in addressing AIDS in Malaysia which
impede the translation of the theme of shared rights and shared
responsibilities into a lived reality?

And what sort of strategies and initiatives should we be looking at to
improve efforts in combating the disease?

Yee Khim Chong, the Human Resources and Training Coordinator of Pink
Triangle, an NGO which has been instrumental in the efforts to combat AIDS
in Malaysia, believes that the access to and dissemination of information
about AIDS is an area that needs to be improved.

"I believe that people have a right to information," he says. "Education
is one of the most effective ways of preventing the spread of AIDS - we
need to make information about AIDS as accessible as possible, to as many
sectors of the community as possible."

But he points out that there are certain factors which obstruct the
dissemination of information: "For instance, there's a general confusion
about whether we can use the word condom' or explicit pictures in
educating about AIDS.

"The Home Ministry seems to say that we are allowed to as long as it is
in aid of HIV prevention, but when I went on a radio show recently, we
were briefed not to mention the word condom' unless the caller did so -
apparently that was in accordance with the Ministry of Information."

Yee adds that this confusion really hampers their attempts at educating
and informing the public about AIDS.

"For example," he says, "we drew up some information leaflets aimed at
the transsexual community which were quite explicit - many transsexuals
are illiterate, so graphic information is most effective - but the printer
refused to print them because he was afraid his licence would be revoked
for printing porn.

"And the radio is one of the best ways of reaching people in rural
areas, so if we can't explain fully how they can protect themselves, we
are denying them vital information."

Another area that he feels needs to be improved is that of support and
care for people with AIDS. Widespread ignorance about how the disease is
transmitted and judgemental attitudes are some of the factors which lead
to people with AIDS often being rejected, sometimes even by family
members.

"We need to work much harder at creating supportive environments for
people with AIDS," Yee says. "I have had callers telling me they are
afraid to approach doctors for medical attention because Malaysian doctors
are very judgemental. There are huge prejudices we need to break through
so that people with AIDS get the care they need and deserve.

"I feel that we've talked a lot about the preventive aspects of AIDS but
not enough about the care and support mechanisms we need to put into
action."

Lawyer Chacko Vadaketh, a member of the legal and ethical committee of
the Malaysian AIDS Council and secretary of the Medical and Legal Society
of Malaysia, agrees that HIV-infected individuals need far more support
than available to them at present.

"From what I hear, many private practitioners refuse to treat HIV-
positive people," he says. "And I have heard of people who have tested
positive being ostracised by their families or communities.

"There's a high level of ignorance and fear which leads to this sort of
attitude, and there needs to be more information.

"There used to be ads on buses saying AIDS membunuh, for example. It's
fair enough saying that, but you then have to say why it kills, and how it
can be prevented. Otherwise it just spreads panic and blind fear."

Employment is another area of concern to Chacko, as at the moment there
is no legislation in Malaysia which explicitly protects the right of
someone who is HIV-positive to work.

"The Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 states that everyone
has the right to work and to protection from unemployment," he says.

"And the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights
(1966) also recognises the right of everyone to work. But these are not
binding. At the moment Malaysia is a signatory to the covenant but has not
ratified it.

"In America, the Americans with Disabilities Act prohibits employers
from discriminating against people with HIV/AIDS, and it is an offence to
require prospective employees to be tested for HIV.

"There is nothing like that here, and employers quite frequently require
their employees to undergo a test. The Industrial Relations Act does say
that a workman cannot be dismissed without just cause, but does dismissal
on the grounds of HIV status constitute just cause? That is left up to the
judiciary to decide.

"The Employment Act also has a provision which says that an employee may
terminate his or her contract with the employer if there is a threat of
disease.

"There have been incidents of large numbers of staff walking out on an
employer because they discovered that someone in the company was HIV-
positive. So the employer can argue that he had to dismiss that individual
so as not to lose the majority of his workforce."

Chacko also feels that there needs to be medical insurance for people
with HIV/AIDS.

"At the moment, there is no medical insurance available in Malaysia,
because insurance companies are afraid of the costs. But if everybody in
the industry is prepared to take on people with HIV/AIDS, then the costs
will be spread.

"And research in the US has shown that the costs of giving insurance for
AIDS is comparable to that for cancer or heart disease, so if they are
prepared to give insurance for those diseases they should also consider
AIDS."

The Malaysian AIDS Charter, Chacko feels, is a start in protecting the
rights of people with HIV/AIDS.

"It's not binding, but it is persuasive. It sets out an ideal situation
which we can try to achieve. Of course there is a lot to be done to
improve the quality of life for people who are HIV-positive.

"Hopefully Malaysia will ratify the International Covenant on Economic,
Social and Cultural Rights soon. And legal reform is crucial, we need to
work on that, but the Charter is an important step forward."

WORLD AIDS DAY Vow to fight global epidemic falls short, activists say

BYLINE: By Scott Bronstein STAFF WRITER

SECTION: FOREIGN NEWS; Section E; Page 3

LENGTH: 233 words


Paris - World leaders signed a declaration here Thursday calling for a global
effort to combat the "planetary emergency" of AIDS - a document that was
immediately criticized by AIDS activists as lacking specifics and funding
provisions.

Attending a global AIDS summit on World AIDS Day, representatives from 42
nations - including the United States - signed the document, outlining a
seven-point resolution on AIDS research and treatment.

Speaking at the conference, U.S. Health Secretary Donna Shalala said a
collaborative, international effort will be required to combat the AIDS
epidemic, which has claimed 250,000 American lives.

''Any breach in human solidarity is a victory for the virus," Shalala said.

Specifically, the resolution calls for strengthening community-based AIDS
support networks, cooperative AIDS research efforts, initiatives to reduce the
vulnerability of women, mobilizing efforts to work with children with AIDS and
ensuring access to health care.

The French government put up about $ 25 million to help move the goals of the
resolution forward. But the AIDS activist group ACT UP and other like-minded
organizations handed out a 16-page document criticizing the resolution.

"This document is business as usual, and we can no longer stand for that; it
will no longer work," said Richard Burzinski, an activist with the Paris group
Icaso who is HIV-positive.

AMID FIRE, AIDS CZAR QUITS AFTER JUST A YEAR / ACTIVISTS SAID KRISTINE GEBBIE
WAS ATTENTIVE, BUT INEFFECTIVE. CLINTON PROMISED A SUCCESSOR.

BYLINE: Huntly Collins, INQUIRER STAFF WRITER

SECTION: NATIONAL; Pg. A03

LENGTH: 584 words


After just one year in office, the nation's first AIDS czar will step down by
Aug. 2.

Kristine M. Gebbie's decision to resign as head of the Office of National AIDS
Policy follows growing criticism of her performance by AIDS groups.

They have faulted her for failing to wage a strong enough public crusade against
the AIDS epidemic, which has claimed the lives of more than 220,870 Americans.

Gebbie, a former nurse and public health administrator, submitted her
resignation yesterday.

In an interview, Gebbie said it was hard "to quantify" what role the criticism
played in her decision to step down. "It was just the time" to move on, she
said.

During her tenure, Gebbie set up the nation's first AIDS training program for
federal workers and worked to increase federal funding for women and children
infected with the AIDS virus.

She also helped broker a deal to scuttle the Army's plans for a $20 million
trial of an experimental AIDS vaccine that had bypassed the normal scientific
review process.

With Gebbie's help, the money for the trial was retained for AIDS research but
redirected to other projects.

'WITH DEDICATION'

Clinton accepted Gebbie's resignation, saying she had served "ably and with
dedication."

Health and Human Services Secretary Donna E. Shalala said Gebbie's "dedication
to fighting a terrible epidemic defines her as a true public health
professional."

The White House named no immediate replacement for Gebbie. But Victor Zonana,
Shalala's spokesman, said the administration would retain the post of AIDS czar.

Gebbie, a former chief state health officer in Oregon and Washington state, was
appointed by Clinton last June as part of a campaign promise to step up the
government's war on AIDS.

Although Gebbie had no national reputation in the AIDS field, many AIDS groups
were willing to give her the benefit of the doubt as she began her new job. But
in recent months, they became vocal in their complaints that she has
accomplished very little over the last year.

Daniel T. Bross, executive director of the AIDS Action Council, a lobbying group
based in Washington, said Gebbie had become a stumbling block to fighting the
AIDS epidemic.

"We are a year into this and there is still a lack of clarity as to what the
function, roles and responsibilities of the (AIDS) office are," he said.

AUTHORITY CALLED LACKING

He said Gebbie's office had distributed inaccurate information about federal
AIDS funding and failed to develop a comprehensive national plan to fight AIDS.

Marion Banzhaf, executive director of the New Jersey Women and AIDS Network,
said Gebbie was doomed to fail because the Clinton administration has given the
AIDS office no power.

"If we are going to have an AIDS czar or czarina, they have to have real
authority," Banzhaf said.

Kiyoshi Kuromiya, editor of Critical Path, a nationally distributed AIDS
treatment newsletter, said Gebbie failed to exert the leadership Clinton had
promised during his presidential campaign.

"Kristine Gebbie had nice things to say," Kuromiya said. "She met with anyone
and everyone. But in one year, we haven't seen her do anything except arrange
meetings."

Despite the criticisms, Zonana said the Clinton administration has done more
than its predecessors.

He pointed to increases in federal spending for AIDS, a new national task force
to promote faster development of AIDS drugs and a stepped-up government campaign
for AIDS prevention, including the use of condoms.

LEGAL AID DELAYS DENY JUSTICE TO CLIENTS: SOLICITOR

SOURCE: QNP

BYLINE: GAGLIARDI J

LENGTH: 630 words


Legal aid delays deny justice to clients: solicitor By JASON GAGLIARDI legal
reporter BRISBANE solicitors said yesterday delays in the legal aid system were
making it almost impossible for some clients to get justice in family law
matters. Solicitor Ms Dianne Soon said the legal aid office often took weeks to
process applications for legal aid when, in cases like custody disputes, every
day could be vital. ""The system does not respond quickly enough in crisis
situations," Ms Soon said. ""My contention is that the delay in assessing
situations is unacceptable and is exposing children to risk. ""It is very
unsatisfactory to the access parent to be sitting around waiting to see if they
can get legal aid while the custodial parent takes off to some unknown address
with the children." The state's legal aid system has been plagued by a shortage
of funds in recent months. One of the main problems has been the drop in
interest earned on solicitors' trust accounts, which makes up a large part of
legal aid funding. Ms Soon said the current service level in the legal aid
office was unacceptable. ""I appreciate the funding difficulties but when the
safety of a child is involved, these matters must be dealt with quickly," she
said. ""I have one case where the wife has taken the child and disappeared
completely somewhere up north. ""The husband was the custodial parent and the
wife just grabbed the child and took off. ""The (legal aid) office has taken an
extraordinarily long time to look at his application _ it has been more than a
month and he still has not even heard whether he can get legal aid." Another
Brisbane solicitor said some clients had been told legal aid was approved, then
""literally on the doorstep of the court" were told the legal aid office had
reversed its decision. The solicitor, who did not wish to be named because
three-quarters of his business was legal aid work, said this was often a
crushing blow to already overwrought clients. ""It's not as if they are told
from the start there is no hope (of getting legal aid)," he said. ""They are
told by legal aid that all is well, then they are suddenly called in for a merit
assessment and told the office has changed its mind." One of his clients is
involved in a custody battle with the Family Services Department over her
three-year-old twins, taken into the department's care more than a year ago.
""She was told legal aid was approved, a five-day trial was set down for
September 25, there was a great stack of witnesses, counsel was briefed: then
they called her up and said there would be no legal aid. ""This was a
complicated custody matter, with a lot of expert witnesses required. ""There's
no way she can go ahead without some sort of funding _ the trial would be at
least a $10,000 exercise." He said another client had a similar experience
recently. ""This was a young fellow who had very strong prospects of getting
interim custody of a child the wife was mistreating," the solicitor said.
""Legal aid had given the okay, we were in the court, the hearing was about to
start and the other side's counsel stood up and said legal aid for my client had
been revoked. ""It turned out that legal aid had reversed their decision on
giving my client legal aid because the wife had not been able to get legal aid."
He said legal aid had since been reinstated for his client. ""The effect this
has on people is horrendous _ they give people hope and then pull the rug out
from under their feet," he said. He said legal aid had become a big bureaucracy
and administration costs seemed to chew up most of its budget. ""In Logan City,
the most luxurious legal premises is the legal aid offices _ to me that seems
ridiculous," he said. MS Dianne Soon . . . "very unsatisfactory'

YOUTHS LISTEN, DON'T ACT ON AIDS, AREA EXPERTS SAY

BYLINE: Roger Signor Post-Dispatch Science-Medicine Editor

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 6A

LENGTH: 595 words


When a respectable grandmother from St. Louis tells groups of teen-agers and
college students how she contracted AIDS, they listen.  But the woman, who asks
that she be identified only as ''Pat,'' doubts that many youngsters heed her
advice. AIDS counselors and doctors agree with Pat: Many students ''just don't
believe AIDS can happen to them.'' Pat, 50, was infected with the AIDS virus in
1984 by a heterosexual partner who did not tell her he had the disease.  ''Now
that Magic Johnson has made his situation known, maybe it will help change
attitudes about AIDS among young people,'' Pat said in an interview Thursday.
She said she tells young people ''they must practice prevention because AIDS is
difficult to catch - if you don't have several different sex partners and if you
practice safe sex.'' She said she got AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome)
because she had failed to ask a sexual partner about his past sexual activities.
St. Louis-area doctors and AIDS counselors unanimously applaud the decision by
basketball star Earvin ''Magic'' Johnson to announce publicly Thursday that he
had been infected by the AIDS virus. But they also agree that even famous role
models like Johnson aren't enough to educate the public about the disease.
''Internists and pediatricians need to make sure that they include AIDS in
discussions in what doctors call 'anticipatory guidance' for their patients,''
said Dr. Linda A. Fisher, chief medical officer for St. Louis County's health
department. ''AIDS can affect anyone with a sex life; so guidance from doctors
should also be given to their adult patients,'' Fisher said. ''People in their
20s and 30s aren't as cautious about sexual activity as they should be.'' But
some doctors in private practice here said few of their colleagues discussed
AIDS with patients.  ''AIDS hasn't seemed to be a problem in suburbia, but Magic
Johnson's revelation indicates that West County doctors should take AIDS
education more seriously,'' said Dr. David L. Gearhart, Missouri section
chairman of the American College for Obstetrics and Gynecology.  Dr. Shiraz
Sunderji, an obstetrician at St. John's Mercy Medical Center in Creve Coeur,
advocates educating all obstetric-gynecologic patients about AIDS.
''Schoolchildren, starting in junior high or middle school, should also be
informed,'' he said. ''The more people are informed, there will be less hysteria
about AIDS - and the Magic Johnson-type of situations could perhaps be
avoided.'' But AIDS education needs fine-tuning before most youngsters practice
safe sex, says Katie Enestvedt, campus outreach coordinator for the St. Louis
Effort for AIDS.  ''College and high school students are well-informed about
AIDS, but they're not practicing safer sex,'' Enestvedt said Friday. ''No w, we
need to take the next step and teach them how to talk to potential sex partners
about their past sexual activity, and how to use condoms safely.'' She said her
agency's phone was ''ringing a lot today with calls from heteosexual males who
are really nervous about AIDS in the wake of Magic Johnson's announcement.'' Dr.
David J. Prelutsky, a south St. Louis internist who treats about 50 AIDS
patients, said: ''I personally try to talk to all my adolescent patients (about
AIDS, but most doctors do not attempt to discuss AIDS with their patients.'' To
get doctors to do more AIDS education, the AIDS committee of the St.  Louis
Metropolitan Medical Society has designed special classes, says Dr.  Alice
Kitchen, a St. Louis psychiatrist who heads the committee.

U of T studies 245 men at high risk

BYLINE: By Lillian Newbery Toronto Star

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A9

LENGTH: 475 words


   The big question for the future of AIDS is what is likely to happen to the
several millions of people who have been exposed to the AIDS virus and are
carrying the antibody in their blood. No one knows what proportion will develop
AIDS.

Dr. Randall Coates is director of a University of Toronto epidemiology study
which is watching the health of 245 men who were sexual partners of men who
developed AIDS-related complex or AIDS. These are clearly men at high risk for
AIDS. Of those who had the antibody to the virus that transmits AIDS, 8 per cent
have developed AIDS in the past two years.

The U.S. National Academy of Science estimates that between 25 and 50 per cent
of those infected with the virus will develop AIDS eventually.

The Centres for Disease Control in Atlanta estimate that between 10 and 30 per
cent of the infected will go on to the final stage of AIDS in the next 5 to 10
years.

"I suppose it's possible" to assume that everyone who is infected will
eventually succomb to AIDS," Coates said, "but it's not necessarily right."

And if so, Coates wonders, does it mean that everyone would die prematurely or
that some might live on to 70 or more and then die of AIDS instead of cancer or
heart disease?

Some men who have been studied at the AIDS screening clinic at Toronto General
Hospital have been ill with AIDS-related complex back in 1981 and are "hale and
hearty" today, Coates says.

In the U of T study, the researchers are also trying to figure out why some
sexual contacts of men with AIDS became infected with the virus and others did
not.

About 2 per cent of persons who have the antibody are coming down with AIDS each
year, says Dr. Alastair Clayton, director-general of the Laboratory Centre for
Disease Control in Ottawa.

"What we don't know is what happens to this virus" in the body, whether it
possibly retreats into nerves and emerges again as a herpes virus does, perhaps
years later.

The incubation period "could be a lifetime and maybe it doesn't matter so much
if it's going to become active at age 70 or 80. Only time is going to give us
this answer."

One reason for some of the recent gloom-and-doom over AIDS originated in a
report called AIDS and the Third World by The Panos Institute, described in the
British magazine New Scientist as a "new lobby group in London looking for a
niche".

The Panos report, calling AIDS a plague that could halve the population of
central Africa, was based on the notion that everyone infected with the human
immunodefeficieny virus would eventually develop AIDS and die.

No one denies that AIDS itself is fatal nor that the situation in Africa is
particularly grim. But most scientists view Panos' numbers as pure speculation.

Workers With AIDS May Have Legally Protected 'Handicap'

BYLINE: By Michael Abramowitz, Washington Post Staff Writer

Nine months ago, the personnel manager of a small Denver company called the
firm's lawyer with some disturbing news: the night before one of their employes
had died from Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).

As the lawyer, Laurance E. Baccini of Philadelphia, recalls the incident, two
hours later he received another call from the official, who reported that he was
just visited by the dead victim's lover, also a company employe.

Another two hours transpired, and the company telephoned again. The word had
leaked out among the company's work force. "Everybody wants to walk out,"
Baccini was told. "What do we do?"

Baccini says he did some quick research and concluded that it would be
appropriate for the firm to fire the individual to defuse the situation. As he
quickly adds, however, "If I were called upon to give that advice today, I would
be dead wrong."

An increasing number of lawyers like Baccini are coming to the conclusion that
AIDS patients are legally disabled and subject to the protection of federal and
state laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of a handicap. Those laws
require companies to treat handicapped workers who can otherwise fulfill the
duties of their job the same as those with no disabilities.

Only a handful of job-discrimination cases have been brought by AIDS victims
around the country under this theory, but the number is growing as precedents
are slowly set in this fast-emerging area of labor and occupational law.

These lawsuits and complaints are only the most public manifestation of the
kinds of thorny employment issues facing businesses around the country as a
result of the rapid appearance of AIDS in the workplace.

Many corporate managers are wondering what to do for their employes who contract
AIDS. At the same time, they are being confronted by instances of job action by
workers who fear contracting the disease from a stricken colleague. Companies
that bear most of the cost of health care insurance are seeking methods of
keeping down the potentially astronomical medical costs of treating AIDS
patients. And firms are beginning to consider requiring bloods tests of
prospective employes to see if they have been exposed to the AIDS virus.

"If you ignore AIDS because you believe you're never going to face it in your
workplace, I think you're making a big mistake," Robert C. Gombar, a Virginia
attorney knowledgeable about AIDS, told a recent gathering of area business
executives.

With more than 18,000 reported cases of AIDS, signs are available that companies
are beginning to take heed. A number of firms, such as BankAmerica and several
others mostly on the West Coast, have developed explicit policies for dealing
with AIDS and other catastrophic illnesses. Trade associations are sponsoring
information sessions for businesses, and social workers and consultants working
on AIDS issues report increased interest in their services.

Still, the evidence suggests that in many ways American business remains
unprepared for the legal and ethical issues presented by the AIDS crisis. Recent
surveys indicate that a large percentage of companies have not thought out how
they would handle incidences of AIDS in the workplace, while a tiny minority had
adopted formal written guidelines.

Yet the surveys also show that many companies, large and small, are being forced
to deal with the disease. A study by management consultants Towers, Perrin,
Forster & Crosby, for instance, shows that roughly a fifth of the firms it
questioned reported having workers with AIDS, although the reactions of
individual companies can often prove quite different.

For example, Bill, a public relations officer for a Washington-based trade
association, reports that his boss "was devastated" when Bill informed him in
January that he had been diagnosed as having AIDS. But he said he was told that
"as long as you can work, you can work here," while the association continued
his health insurance and other benefits.

"I'm a dying man, but I'm one of the luckiest men in the world to have all this
support," added Bill, who asked that his last name not be given.

Not all workers have been so fortunate. Jim Graham, director of the
Whitman-Walker Clinic, a service center for AIDS patients, said the clinic has
reports of 30 area workers -- from hair dressers and hotel clerks to computer
operators and school teachers -- who have been dismissed from their jobs in
recent months after AIDS diagnoses.

"Its still a very uneven situation," said Graham, who himself has provided legal
help to many of these dismissed workers. "I know of employers who have clothed,
and protected, and been very generous to employes who have AIDS. On the other
hand, there are a number of employers who haven't taken that attitude. I've seen
both."

Although they say the dismissals continue, Graham and lawyers for businesses
agree that a growing body of medical evidence and legal precedents is making it
difficult for firms to fire AIDS patients without exposing themselves to sizable
liability.

A key event was the Centers for Disease Control's release last November of
guidelines on preventing the transmission of AIDS in the workplace. The
guidelines stressed what many epidemiologists had been saying for some time --
that AIDS is a sexually transmitted disease, and there is no known risk of
passing on the AIDS virus in offices, factories, and most other workplace
settings.

Meanwhile, although only a few cases of alleged discrimination have actually
reached the courts since the disease was first discovered, lawyers say that
several legal developments also have strengthened the hands of AIDS patients.

One is that a number of jurisdictions, including the District, have indicated
that they interpret their laws prohibiting discrimination against the
handicapped to include AIDS victims. Forty-two states and the District have such
antidiscrimination statutes.

In addition, a decision by a federal appeals court last year held that the
federal law preventing discrimination against the disabled applies to people
with chronic contagious diseases, such as tuberculosis. Labor experts said they
believe that AIDS would be interpreted as falling within this category.

"I think that a number of employers and lawyers are surprised that a
communicable disease is a handicap, but that is the way the law is evolving,"
said Martin D. Schneiderman, an attorney who has consulted with several
corporate clients about AIDS issues.

Another volatile issue for companies is whether or not to screen employes or
prospective employes to see if they have been exposed to HTLV-III, the AIDS
virus. Only Enserch Corp. a Texas energy firm, has publicly stated it conducts
blood testing of employes -- in this case of food handlers in the company
cafeteria -- but surveys indicate that a number of other firms are considering
such programs.

"We weren't adequately testing our food service workers for communicable
diseases," Howard L. Matson, an Enserch spokesman, said of the company's
decision last fall to start screening. "If someone comes up with AIDS
antibodies, we're going to remove him from the food-handling area. Suffice it to
say, we're going to take care of that person. We're not going to cut him loose."

Matson discounted the CDC guidelines on AIDS in the workplace. "Right now we
don't feel there is a large enough body of knowledge that we can take a chance,"
he said.

Many legal experts, however, question whether screening is a good idea. For one
thing, they say, the blood screening test now available cannot identify the
presence of the AIDS virus itself, but only whether a person may have been
exposed to the virus. Public health officials have estimated that there are
anywhere from one million to two million people who have been exposed, many of
whom will never contract the disease.

Moreover, because the law appears to prevent firms from firing otherwise able
AIDS patients, lawyers say the test is useless and may only serve to open up
firms' legal liability. "If you test, and you can't do anything about it, then
what's the point of knowing about it?" asked Schneiderman.

Indeed, a large number of firms have eschewed testing of workers, and have
sought to accommodate AIDS victims. Even for these firms, however, dealing with
AIDS can be fraught with a host of other difficulties.

A major concern is the havoc medical bills from AIDS might play on the premiums
charged by the group health insurance plans that most companies offer their
employes. The CDC, for instance, has calculated that the average cost of
treating an AIDS patient is in the $140,000 range.

Nancy L. Merritt, a vice president of BankAmerica, one of the first companies to
adopt an AIDS policy, said that as a result of such calculations, many
companies, including her own, have sought the use of hospices and other
alternatives to hospitalization as a means of keeping health costs down.

Perhaps the most perplexing problem for many companies facing AIDS in the
workplace is how to deal with the fears -- and often hysteria -- of coworkers.
Lawyers say that given the medical consensus that AIDS is not transmitted
casually in the workplace, workers who refuse to work with an AIDS victim are on
shaky legal ground.

But as Baccini, the Philadelphia labor lawyer, suggests, "The practicalities of
the situation are difficult to deal with. No matter how hysterical employes are,
how does an employer deal with it when they walk out en masse because of the
fear?"

Legal standing was of little help to Charles Devane, a prison official in New
York, who told a recent conference on AIDS that there have been 30 to 40
instances in which guards have refused to carry out routine tasks because they
feared contracting AIDS from inmates. Caitlin Ryan, a District social worker who
has dealt with many AIDS patients, said that she has been called in on occasion
to deal with workers' fears after an employe was found to have AIDS.

Gay Groups Ask D.C. to Boost Funds for AIDS

BYLINE: By Margaret Engel, Washington Post Staff Writer

SECTION: First Section; A1

LENGTH: 1006 words


A coalition of gay rights groups asked District Mayor Marion Barry yesterday for
$1.5 million to handle the more than 200 new cases of AIDS expected in the city
in the next year.

The coalition's request, which includes $500,000 in federal funds for testing
for AIDS exposure, is $1.3 million more than the $175,000 the city has budgeted
for acquired immune deficiency syndrome projects.

Meeting with coalition leaders last night, Barry promised he would meet with
them again in 30 days to respond to their request.

Department of Human Services spokesman Charles Siegel said it is likely that the
current budget, which represents a $110,000 increase over fiscal 1985, will be
increased.

Citing public health figures that show that the number of AIDS cases has doubled
in the last six months, the D.C. Committee on AIDS Issues predicts there will be
a total of 465 cases of AIDS in the District by next October, an estimate it
termed "conservative."

A total of 252 cases have been reported to District health authorities since
1983, according to Dr. Martin Levy, director of the District's Preventive Health
Services Administration. Thirty-one city AIDS patients have died.

In a news conference after the coalition's meeting with the mayor, Public Health
Commissioner Andrew McBride said the city's 1986 AIDS budget "represents what we
knew 18 months ago about AIDS."

McBride, who credited the coalition with increasing the city's awareness of the
growing demand for AIDS services, said AIDS has become a larger issue for the
city because of the "public perception that now it's not just a gay disease."

Describing AIDS as "a major public health problem in the District," McBride said
the city will begin a unified effort with the coalition to "attack this
condition."

Bill Bogan, a spokesman for the group, said, "We should have been sitting with
him Barry a year ago. Things have hit us quicker than we would have liked."

"The leadership of the gay community believes this money is essential to support
local AIDS efforts," said Jim Graham, administrator of the Whitman-Walker
Clinic, which provides counseling, emergency housing and other support for AIDS
patients. The clinic intends to open a second group home for AIDS patients in
D.C. within two months because of a waiting list for space in its current home,
Schwartz House.

The coalition asked the mayor to support three additional group homes for AIDS
patients, housing assistance for 94 patients, an in-home care program for 76
people and a program to stress "safe sex" behavior to reduce the transmission of
the AIDS virus.

"We believe now is the time to set into place programs that will be able to
address this need in future years, when the numbers will be significantly
greater," according to a statement issued by the coalition.

The coalition also is requesting that the city establish an AIDS Activities
Office.

The city has several offices within the Preventative Health Services
Administration that focus on specific health problems, including offices on high
blood pressure, tuberculosis and teen-age pregnancy.

Most of the city's efforts on AIDS have involved grants to the Whitman-Walker
Clinic for its AIDS hot line and public education projects, including a special
effort aimed at informing blacks and Hispanics about the risks of AIDS.

In the fiscal year that ended last week, the Whitman-Walker Clinic received
$62,500 from the D.C. Commission on Public Health and $45,000 from the federal
government for its program to test blood for the AIDS virus. The clinic received
most of its financial support -- $175,880 last year -- from community donations,
chiefly from gay men's and women's groups. Volunteers also donated 24,352 hours
of time to the clinic.

In their private meeting last night with Barry, coalition leaders requested:

* $427,000 for an in-care home program, patterned after a project in San
Francisco, to hire home health aides for 20 hours a week and two visits by
nurses twice a week for 76 people with AIDS.

* $400,000 for public education, especially paid advertising, to inform the
public about AIDS.

* $226,500 for blood testing, a network of volunteer "buddies" for AIDS patients
and other programs at the Whitman-Walker Clinic.

* $170,640 to subsidize rents of 94 AIDS patients, at an average cost of $316 a
month, to allow them to remain in their homes. Many AIDS patients are unable to
work and cannot continue to pay for their housing, Bogan said.

* $120,000 to establish three group homes to house 23 persons with AIDS.

* $113,370 to set up an AIDS Activities Office in the D.C. government.

* $100,000 to recruit 1,000 persons for sessions to educate them about safe sex
practices.

* $24,000 to continue the Whitman-Walker AIDS hot line.

Several of the programs, such as the safe sex seminars, are in operation in San
Francisco, New York and other cities. In the past, government offices have
balked at printing materials dealing with safe sex techniques because of
controversies about spending tax dollars for sexually explicit information.

But Bogan said resistance has eased "because people are aware the information
must go out." McBride noted that in other public health education campaigns, the
city has issued brochures aimed at specific risk groups. "We allow those kind of
materials to be developed."

Although 40 gay activists from nearly a dozen groups met with the mayor, the
coalition is composed primarily of the Capitol Area Republicans, Langston
Hughes-Eleanor Roosevelt Democratic Club, the Whitman-Walker Clinic, Gay
Activists Alliance, Gertrude Stein Democratic Club and the D.C. Coalition of
Black Gay Men and Women.

Members of these gay groups worked in Barry's 1980 and 1984 mayoral campaigns.

Graham said the coalition was formed because of the strain on volunteers and
agencies that provide help for District AIDS patients. "We're all getting
flooded with requests for help," he said. "There has to be a more serious
commitment of funds to deal with the problem."

Interest in first aid soars after security campaign

BYLINE: LIZ MINCHIN

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. 9

LENGTH: 430 words


Demand for first aid training has skyrocketed in Victoria following the mailout
of the Federal Government's national security booklet, Let's Look Out for
Australia.

The two training organisations named in the booklet, St John Ambulance and the
Australian Red Cross, have both had increases in first aid course bookings this
month.

St John Ambulance, Australia's largest first aid trainer, expects to teach 5100
Victorians first aid this month, up more than 60 per cent from the 3179 people
it trained in February last year.

Red Cross Victoria's executive director Andrew Hilton said that telephone
inquiries about training had almost doubled in the past week. "We're putting
that (increase) down to distribution of the Government booklet," Mr Hilton said.

The Red Cross is developing a disaster preparation course aimed at the general
public, which Mr Hilton said should be available soon.

St John Victoria is also responding to the rise, boosting its schedule of first
aid courses and its production of emergency first aid kits.

The Government began mailing its booklet to all Australian households on
February 3 and advises people to learn first aid and own a first aid kit.

But other first aid training companies said they had had no more bookings than
usual, and accused the Government of damaging their businesses by singling out
two organisations in the booklet.

FIRST AID COURSES

· Level 1 (Basic First Aid)

An introduction to first aid, teaching cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), how
to handle breathing emergencies, wounds, bandaging, injuries to bones, joints
and muscles, and poisoning, bites and stings.

· Level 2 (Senior First Aid)

As well as teaching basic first aid skills, participants learn how to recognise
and manage medical conditions that may need emergency care, including heart
attack, stroke, asthma, diabetes and epilepsy, as well as practical first aid
skills using prepared and improvised materials.

· Level 3 (Occupational First Aid)

Participants must have a current Senior First Aid certificate. Learn about
handling emergencies at work, legal and ethical aspects of occupational first
aid, emergency assessment and triage principles, basic life support, advanced
resuscitation skills, wound care, burns, poisoning, using first aid equipment
and reporting and record-keeping skills.

AIDS coalition attacks level of provincial funding: Groups call for resignation
of health minister, demand an extra $ 2 million to continue work of prevention,
education and support programs across B.C.

BYLINE: KEVIN GRIFFIN; VANSUN

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. B3

A new ministry of health approach to AIDS funding has left some AIDS community
groups throughout the province reeling.

On Monday, a newly formed AIDS coalition was trying to arrange a meeting with
Premier Mike Harcourt to rectify what they describe as totally inadequate
funding for AIDS education and prevention.

The coalition has called on Health Minister Paul Ramsey to resign and for an
immediate infusion of an extra $ 2 million to continue AIDS prevention,
education and support services throughout the province.

The coalition, which includes 21 groups ranging from AIDS Vancouver and
Multicultural AIDS & HIV Coalition to Nanaimo Street Outreach -- Needle Exchange
and Black AIDS Network, also called for a boycott of the 1996 International AIDS
Conference scheduled for Vancouver.

One of the programs affected is the Surrey Needle Exchange, which helps an
estimate 1,000 intravenous drug users.

Director Jim Bennett said he asked for $ 100,000 -- half of the exchange's
annual budget that is jointly funded through alcohol and drug programs.

But he only got $ 50,000, which leaves the needle exchange with a deficit of $
50,000.

"It means severe cutbacks or termination of services," he said.

"They told us to go out into the community and make partnerships. That's what we
did and look what's happened. It is just so stupid."

At the Positive Women's Network, executive director Marcie Summers said AIDS
groups have patiently waited for a new direction on AIDS funding from the NDP
government for two years. But the time for being quiet is over, she said.

"What they've done is irresponsible. What kind of foresight is this? The
government's response is (for us) to do creative fund raising?" Summers said.

Rick Marchand, executive director of AIDS Vancouver, said at this point, the
organization doesn't have the money to survive past July.

"We put our faith in this government that they were going to turn things
around," said Marchand, head of the largest and oldest AIDS group in the
province. "It is just an absolute insult in terms of money."

AIDS Vancouver had requested $ 624,570 for support services and education but
received only $ 395,374; the group also asked for an operating grant of $
500,000 and received $ 100,000.

But an official with the Provincial AIDS Secretariat said AIDS community groups
should take into account that the over-all

10-per-cent increase in funding from $ 2.5 million to $ 2.75 million compares
favorably with what other programs, such as sexual abuse counselling, have
received.

Mary Clifford, co-chair of the 21-member secretariat that allocates AIDS
funding, also said not all AIDS community groups support the coalition's
position. She declined to name those groups.

Clifford said she understands what other groups are facing because the Prince
George needle exchange she works at has had its funding cut from $ 100,000 to $
63,000.

"There is no more money to give. People have to realize that's all (there is),"
she said from Prince George.

She said part of the ministry of health's strategy is to put pressure on AIDS
community groups to streamline the delivery of services to eliminate duplication
and to get other programs and ministries such as social services and housing to
start funding AIDS programs.

Michael Callen, Singer and Expert On Coping With AIDS, Dies at 38

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

SECTION: Section D; Page 19; Column 1; Metropolitan Desk

LENGTH: 686 words


Michael Callen, a writer and singer who embodied for a dozen years the
possibility of long-term survival with AIDS, died of the disease Monday night at
Midway Hospital in Los Angeles. He was 38 years old and lived in West Hollywood,
Calif.

Mr. Callen was the author of "Surviving AIDS" (HarperCollins, 1990), a founder
of the People With AIDS Coalition and the Community Research Initiative in New
York, and a member of the Flirtations, an a cappella group to which he
contributed what The Los Angeles Times called "an upper register that Joan
Sutherland would surely envy."

After his AIDS was diagnosed in 1982, Mr. Callen devoted himself to spreading
the message of survival through books, magazines, newspapers, films, concerts
and television appearances. "If we could change our paradigm of AIDS," he said,
"if there weren't that notion that it's all ultimately hopeless and pointless,
it might actually increase survival rates.

"I don't say hope will guarantee you'll beat AIDS," he said, "but you've got to
have it to be in the running."

Fighting Discrimination

Mr. Callen was born in Rising Sun, Ind., and raised in Hamilton, Ohio. He
graduated from Boston University, which he attended on a music scholarship, in
1977. After college, he moved to New York, where he sang in cabarets and with
the New York City Gay Men's Chorus.

He grew into political advocacy after contracting AIDS. An early proponent of
what came to be called safe-sex practices, he wrote "How to Have Sex in an
Epidemic: One Approach," in 1983 with Richard Berkowitz, Dr. Joseph A. Sonnabend
and Richard Dworkin. That year, he was also a plaintiff in the nation's first
AIDS discrimination lawsuit, when Dr. Sonnabend, his physician, successfully
fought eviction from a Greenwich Village co-op for treating people with AIDS.

Also in 1983, Mr. Callen was a member of the founding board of the Lesbian and
Gay Community Services Center in Greenwich Village.

In 1985, Mr. Callen was one of the founders of the People With AIDS Coalition,
based in Manhattan. Among other programs, the coalition maintains a toll-free
phone line staffed entirely by people with AIDS, publishes the monthly "P.W.A.
Coalition Newsline" and maintains what it describes as the largest AIDS
treatment information library in the metropolitan area.

Out of frustration with the slow pace of drug development, Mr. Callen and others
then formed the Community Research Initiative, a group of AIDS patients and
doctors who conducted their own drug trials, including the early use of
aerosolized pentamidine to prevent pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.

Means of Survival

Mr. Callen was the editor of "Surviving and Thriving With AIDS: Hints for the
Newly Diagnosed," which was published by the People With AIDS Coalition in 1987
and then revised and expanded in 1988.

His 1990 book, "Surviving AIDS," told the story of 14 long-term survivors.
Writing in The New York Times Book Review, Dr. Jeffrey Laurence, an AIDS
researcher, said Mr. Callen had managed to "capture the spirit and
eccentricities of men and women who, shouldering an extraordinary burden, simply
will not break."

Mr. Callen himself was the subject of numerous profiles. He was one of three gay
political leaders portrayed in Rosa von Praunheim's 1990 film, "Positive."

Even on the political front lines, Mr. Callen remained devoted to music. His
solo album, "Purple Heart," was released in 1988. That year, the Flirtations
were formed. The quintet has performed nationwide, recorded two albums ("The
Flirtations" and "Out on the Road") and can be seen in Jonathan Demme's new
movie, "Philadelphia."

Mr. Callen wrote the song "Living in Wartime," which was performed in Larry
Kramer's play "The Normal Heart," and, with Peter Allen and Marsha Malamet, he
wrote "Love Don't Need a Reason."

He made his last appearance with the Flirtations during the gay-rights march on
Washington in April.

Mr. Callen is survived by his companion, Mr. Dworkin; his parents, Clifford and
Barbara, of Hamilton, Ohio; a sister, Linda Stanger, of Hamilton and a brother,
Barry, of Chicago.
