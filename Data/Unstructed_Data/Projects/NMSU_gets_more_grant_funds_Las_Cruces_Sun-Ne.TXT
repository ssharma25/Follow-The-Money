LAS CRUCES - More than $300,000 in grants for New Mexico State University have
been announced by U.S. Department of Agriculture-Rural Development State
Director Terry Brunner.

NMSU's Institute for Energy and the Environment received $100,000 from the Rural
Energy for America Program-Energy Audit and Renewable Energy Development
Assistance Grant, which will be used to conduct energy audits for 18 months at
an area dairy farm and chile producer, which have not yet been picked. The
institute will then use the data collected to create best management practices
for other agricultural producers to develop energy efficient plans for their
farming operations.

KRWG-TV, owned and operated by NMSU, also received $206,000 as part of the
Public Television Digital Transition Grant Program, created to help public
broadcasting facilities expand and modernize infrastructure and technology.
KRWG-TV will use the funding for a new microwave system to run from Milton Hall
to the Southern New Mexico Fairgrounds, then to Deming and to Pinos Altos, N.M.
The new system will also be able to automatically monitor if the station goes
off the air, which currently is only known if viewers call in.
